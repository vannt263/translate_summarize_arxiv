    "to study the process of multiple collisions of a jet with medium partons , it is important to distinguish coherent and incoherent collisions @xcite .",
    "the scattering process between the jet and a medium parton can be described by the exchange of a gluon .",
    "such an exchange takes time .",

    "jet-(medium parton ) multiple collisions at rhic and lhc are coherent collisions .",
    "conventional investigations on coherent collisions of a fast particle with medium scatterers use the potential model @xcite-@xcite in which the scatterers are represented by static potentials and the longitudinal recoils of the scatterers are considered as dependent variables that are appendages to the deflected motion of the incident particle . however , the coherent collisions of @xmath11 with @xmath12 medium partons in the reaction @xmath13 is a @xmath14-body collision with 3(@xmath12 + 1 ) degrees of freedom , subject to an over - all four - momentum conservation .",
    "a general treatment of coherent collisions necessitates the use of the _ both _ the transverse and longitudinal recoil momenta of the scatterers as independent dynamical variables , which is not allowed in the potential model .",
    "this leads us to forgo the potential model and to turn to the feynman amplitude approach for the general treatment of coherent collisions .",

    "an incident high-@xmath0 jet and the scatterers can be kinematically separated by angular correlation measurements .",
    "a comparison of the jet and ridge components reveals the presence of a collective momentum transfer to the scatterers along the jet direction , and a phenomenological analysis using the momentum kick model supports the approximate inverse proportionality relation between the magnitude of the longitudinal momentum kick and the number of scatterers .",
    "the empirical ridge yield as a function of centrality suggests the possible presence of a threshold at @xmath125 , as required for the quantum bose - einstein interference .",
