    "creating quantum correlations among photons has been a subject of major interest for studying the foundations of quantum theory as well as applications in quantum information science . as direct interactions between photons in free space",
    "are extremely weak , generation of correlated photons generally requires nonlinear media .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency and photon blockade are mechanisms that have been exploited to achieve strongly interacting photons  @xcite .",
    "recently , studies of two - photon scattering from a two - level system inside a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide have also reported various features of photon correlation @xcite .",
    "for example , shen and fan  @xcite have discovered the existence of two - photon bound states , and roy @xcite has indicated an interesting application of the system as a few - photon optical diode .",
    "we also note that shi and sun  @xcite have employed a formal scattering theory to study multi - photon transport in a 1d waveguide .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the correlation properties of two photons in a 1d waveguide that is side - coupled to a nonlinear cavity filled with a kerr medium ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear cavity plays the role of a scatterer .",
    "it is worth noting that such a kerr nonlinearity has also been employed in coupled cavity array systems for studying quantum phase transition @xcite and nonclassical photon statistics  @xcite .",
    "here we will focus on the transport properties of two photons determined by the long time solution of the schrdinger equation , assuming the initial photons are in wave packet forms .",
    "we will present an analytic solution based on the laplace transform method , which has been applied to related photon - atom scattering problems  @xcite . from the two - photon transmission and reflection amplitudes ,",
    "we show how the two scattered photons can be correlated in frequency and position variables , with the latter revealing photon bunching and anti - bunching effects .",
    "our solution also reveals a two - photon resonance condition when the incident photon energies match the cavity frequency shifted by the kerr interaction .",
    "the behavior of transmission and reflection near the resonance will be discussed .",
    "the physical model under investigation consists of an infinitely long 1d waveguide and a nonlinear cavity located at the origin ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "we consider a single - mode field in the cavity , which couples to right- and left - propagating fields of the waveguide via the side coupling  @xcite so that photons can tunnel between the waveguide and the nonlinear cavity .",
    "the hamiltonian ( with @xmath1 ) of the system is given by @xmath2.\\label{h_tot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are annihilation and creation operators associated with the cavity mode with the resonance frequency @xmath5 .",

    "the hamiltonian of free fields propagating in the waveguide is described by the third term , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are , respectively , the annihilation ( creation ) operators for left- and right - propagating waves with wave number @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 . these operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath13=[\\hat{r}_{k},\\hat{r}^{\\dagger}_{k'}]=\\delta(k - k ' ) , \\hspace{0.5 cm } [ \\hat{l}_{k},\\hat{r}^{\\dagger}_{k'}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , the last term in the hamiltonian  ( [ h_tot ] ) represents the coupling between the cavity and the waveguide , where @xmath14 is the tunneling strength .    for convenience , we introduce even- and odd - parity modes operators of the waveguide , @xmath15 so that hamiltonian  ( [ h_tot ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath16 with    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is introduced .",
    "we see that the interaction involves only even modes , and photons in the odd modes evolve freely in the waveguide",
    ". therefore we shall focus on the calculation of the transport properties of the photons in even modes .    in the rotating frame with respect to @xmath19",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath20 can be simplified to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the detuning . in this paper",
    "the dispersion relation for the modes in the waveguide is assumed to be linear , i.e. , @xmath23 , and we will set the speed of light in the waveguide as @xmath24 .",
    "as a preparation for finding the solution for two - photon scattering , we first consider the single - photon problem  @xcite . note that the kerr nonlinearity has zero effect for single photon states .",
    "the main purpose in this section is to present the single - photon transmission and reflection coefficients , which will appear in the two - photon solution later in the paper .    in the single - excitation subspace",
