    "the latter scenario implies a phase separation .",
    "if ferromagnetic clouds maintain themselves even at a finite low density , it seems that they form a ferromagnetic colloidal solution as known as magnetic fluid or ferrofluid.@xcite since the ferromagnetic clouds are quantum mechanical , an assembly of them is a quantum ferrofluid .",
