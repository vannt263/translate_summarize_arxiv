    "grain size would add to other lines of evidence for substantial grain growth in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) , which provides a first step toward planets .",
    "whether large ( non - spherical ) grains can be aligned with respect to the magnetic field inside a protoplanetary disk remains uncertain . in the context of the currently favored mechanism for grain alignment through radiative torque , their magnetic moments may not be large enough to provide the fast precession needed ( @xcite ; although it depends on the disk field strength , which is uncertain ) , and their slow internal relaxation makes the alignment less efficient @xcite .",
    "more work is needed to address this important issue . in this paper , we will adopt the conventional view that the grains are aligned with respect to the magnetic field @xcite , at least to some extent in the disk , and treat the ( currently uncertain ) degree of alignment as a free parameter .",
    "this treatment allows us to focus on the following question : how would the polarization pattern produced by direct emission from magnetically aligned grains be modified by scattering by the same aligned grains ? it is a step beyond paper i and @xcite , because the grains are no longer assumed to be spherical and the polarization from direct dust emission is included together with that from scattering .",

    "in order to determine how a non - spherical dust grain scatters light , one needs to know how it interacts with an external electromagnetic wave .",
    "the interaction can be very complicated in general , since each grain can be considered as a collection of polarizable parts , and each part responds to its local electric field inside the grain and may have a different polarization and phase .",
    "the grain - light interaction can in principle be treated numerically using , for example , the discrete dipole approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , such numerical treatments tend to be computationally expensive , and are not optimal for an initial exploration of the problem at hand : competition between the scattering and direct emission of non - spherical , magnetically - aligned grains in determining the polarization pattern .",
    "for such a purpose , we have decided to employ the well - known `` electrostatic approximation '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which greatly simplifies the computation of the scattering cross sections without sacrificing the essential physics",
    ". the limitations of this approximation and its future refinements are discussed in section ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opacity ] ) .",
    "our discussion below follows closely that in chapter 5 of bohren & huffman 1983 , to which we refer the readers for details .",
    "the basic requirement for the electrostatic approximation is that the grain size is smaller than the wavelength of the external electromagnetic wave .",
    "in such a case , the electric field varies little across the grain , and the field can be approximated as having the same time dependence throughout the region of interest .",
    "the approximation simplifies the calculation of the polarization of the ( small ) grain using the electrostatic equations with only spatial derivatives .",
    "the scattering cross sections depend on both the size and shape of the dust grain .",
    "the grain shape is not well constrained . for illustration purposes , we model the grain as an ellipsoid , for which analytic solutions are available . for an ellipsoid composed of isotropic material with a complex dielectric constant @xmath2 , the governing electrostatic equations can be solved analytically using ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "the dielectrics will respond to the external field linearly and develop a dipole moment .",
    "since the grains are not spherical , the polarizability @xmath3 that relates the electric dipole moment @xmath4 induced in the grain to the external electric field @xmath5 is not a single number but rather a matrix , i.e. , @xmath6 . in a coordinate system with axes along the three principle axes of the dust grain ,",
    "the polarizability matrix @xmath3 is diagonal , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "its diagonal element can be expressed as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radius of the sphere that has the same volume as the ellipsoid , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is a geometric parameter determined solely by the shape of the grain , subjected to the constraint @xmath12 . in the simplest case of a spherical grain , @xmath10 is @xmath0 . for an ellipsoidal grain ,",
    "@xmath10 can be expressed as an integral that includes the length of the corresponding principle axis as a parameter .",
    "for an spheroid , which is an ellipsoid obtained by rotating an ellipse along one of its principle axis , the integral can be done analytically . following the convention @xmath13 ( which corresponds to the convention for the semi - diameters @xmath14 and diagonal matrix elements @xmath15 )",

    "the other two geometric parameters are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "as the external electric field varies over time , the dipole induced inside the grain also oscillates , which results in dipole radiation .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the scattering matrix and phase matrix of the induced dipole radiation and , through the optical theorem , obtain the absorption cross section .",
    "the resultant scattering and absorption cross sections will be used to compute numerically the polarization due to direct emission and scattering of ( small ) ellipsoidal grains in a young star disk in ",
    "[ sec : disk ] . before doing so",
    ", we will first illustrate the main features of the polarization produced by the scattering of non - spherical grains analytically in a limiting case , which will also allow us to compare with previous work and build physical intuition of how the scattering of non - spherical grains depends on the disk inclination , a focus of this investigation .",
    "in paper i , we showed that the disk inclination with respect to the line of sight plays an important role in the polarization produced by the scattering of spherical grains .",
    "the inclination - induced polarization was illustrated analytically in the limiting case where the disk is geometrically thin and the incoming radiation to be scattered by the grains is locally isotropic in the disk plane ( see their   2.2 ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the polarization fraction of the scattered light by small spherical grains goes from zero for the face - on view to @xmath0 for the edge - on case . here",
    ", we extend this analysis to oblate grains with the semi - diameters @xmath25 @xcite ; the case of prolate grains will be discussed in the appendix  [ sec : imp&geo ] .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the polarization of the light scattered by oblate grains at a location @xmath26 inside a disk that is inclined with respect to the line of sight by an angle @xmath27 ( @xmath28 corresponds to the face - on case ) .",
    "we will adopt a cartesian coordinate system centered on the location @xmath26 , with the @xmath29-axis pointing radially away from the center of the disk , and @xmath30-axis tangential to the circle in the disk plane that is centered at the origin and passes through the point @xmath26 . for simplicity , we assume that the disk magnetic field is purely toroidal , so that the only non - zero component is along the @xmath30-direction . in the case of perfect grain alignment , the y - axis is also the direction of the minor axis of the oblate grain ( with the smallest semi - diameter @xmath31 ) .",
    "the @xmath32-axis of the coordinate system is perpendicular to the disk plane . in this coordinate system",
    ", the polarizability is diagonal : @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we let the @xmath29-axis lie in the plane of the sky , so that the line of sight to the location @xmath26 of interest is perpendicular to the @xmath29-axis and is thus in the @xmath37 plane . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the disk inclination angle @xmath27 is simply the angle between the @xmath32 axis and the line of sight , and the @xmath29-axis is along the major axis of the inclined disk projected in the plane of the sky . for this initial analysis , we focus on the disk locations on the major rather than the minor axis for two reasons . first , the polarization produced by direct emission from the oblate grains on the minor axis is independent of the inclination angle because these grains are aligned with the ( toroidal ) magnetic field in such a way that they always appear `` edge - on '' to the observer .",
    "more importantly , the polarization pattern is expected to be simpler on the minor axis because both direct emission and scattering there tend to produce polarization along the minor axis ( although not always , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] ) , so that they generally add to , rather than cancel , each other .",
    "our goal is to determine the polarization properties of the light that is scattered into our line of sight . in general ,",
    "the stokes parameters of the scattered light ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) are related to those of the incident radiation ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) through a 16-element scattering matrix ( see @xcite , p65 ) .",
    "we assume that the incident light is non - polarized ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , so that only 4 of the matrix elements are relevant , namely : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we assume further that the incident radiation to be scattered at the location @xmath26 is confined in the disk plane ( i.e. , the thin ( dust ) disk approximation ) , so that its direction is uniquely described by the azimuthal angle @xmath51 from the @xmath29-axis . in the limiting case that the incident radiation is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath51 , it is straightforward to average the scattering matrix elements over @xmath51 , which yields the following results : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the wave - number of the scattered light .",
    "in addition , @xmath55 , as expected from the symmetry of the problem .",
    "it means that the scattered light will be polarized either in the @xmath29-direction or perpendicular to it , and that there is no circular polarization .",
    "since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are essentially the differential scattering cross sections for the stokes parameter @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , the degree of polarization of the scattered light is simply given by their ratio : @xmath60 which can be either positive or negative ; a positive ( negative ) @xmath61 means that the polarization direction is parallel ( perpendicular ) to the @xmath29-axis in the plane of the sky .    in order to obtain numerical values for @xmath61 ,",
    "a grain model is needed to calculate the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this will be done in the next subsection . here",
    ", we will make a couple of interesting points that are independent of the detailed grain properties .",
    "first , since @xmath36 for oblate grains , we have @xmath64 in the face - on case with @xmath28 , which means that the scattered light will be polarized in the @xmath29-direction .",
    "this is different from the case of spherical grains , where the polarization in the face - on case is zero .",
    "the difference makes physical sense because , for non - spherical grains , the scattering cross sections for incident light coming from different directions are no longer the same .",
    "in particular , for oblate grains with the short axis aligned with the @xmath30-axis , light propagating along the @xmath30-direction will be scattered more efficiently into our line of sight , producing polarization in the @xmath29-direction .",
    "the degree of polarization will depend on the degree of the grain non - sphericity , as we show below .",
    "second , in the opposite limit of edge - on view ( @xmath65 ) , we have @xmath66 .",
    "this is expected because , when viewed edge - on , the grain is axisymmetric with respect to the line of sight .",
    "it means that the polarization in this limit is determined completely by the inclination effect , which is known to produce a fractional polarization of @xmath0 perpendicular to the @xmath29-axis in the plane of the sky ( i.e. , along the minor axis of the inclined disk , paper i ) . in the limit @xmath67",
    ", we have @xmath68 , which recovers the previous analytic results for spherical grains-@xmath69 , with @xmath70 along the minor axis of the inclined disk . in this paper ,",
    "the @xmath29-axis lies in the plane of the sky and is along the major axis of the disk .",
    "this difference introduces a sign difference between these two results ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we will compute the polarization from the scattering of oblate grains at a location @xmath26 in an inclined disk adopting a specific grain model .",
    "the model allows us to determine diagonal elements of the polarizability matrix , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and , through equation  [ eq : p_sca ] , the degree of polarization , @xmath61 .",
    "the polarization from scattering will be compared with that from the direct emission from the same magnetically aligned oblate grains at the location @xmath26 ( with the shortest axis along the @xmath30-direction ) . to determine the latter ,",
    "the absorption cross sections along the major axis of the inclined disk in the plane of the sky , the @xmath29-axis , and the minor axis ( denoted by @xmath69 hereafter ) , are needed .",

    "several features are immediately apparent .",
    "first , in the limit of spherical grains with @xmath80 , we recover the well known ( analytic ) results that the direct emission is not polarized , and the polarization from scattering is along the minor axis , with a polarization fraction that goes from zero to @xmath0 as the inclination angle @xmath27 increases from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "second , as anticipated analytically in the last subsection , the polarization of the light scattered by the oblate grains aligned with a toroidal magnetic field ( along the @xmath30-direction ) is along the @xmath29-axis ( with a positive @xmath61 ) in the face - on case . as the inclination angle increases , the polarization along the major ( or @xmath29- ) axis is gradually weakened by that from the polarization induced by the inclination , which is along the minor ( or @xmath69- ) axis . at a critical inclination angle @xmath86 , the polarization direction switches from the major axis to the minor axis",

    "the scattering degree of polarization asymptotes to the limiting value @xmath88 as the inclination angle @xmath27 approaches @xmath85 , as we showed analytically above .",
    "third , the polarization of the direct emission by the aligned oblate grains is always along the major ( or @xmath29- ) axis of the disk , which is the direction of the long axis of the grain .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath79 peaks in the face - on case , where the grain appears most elongated to the observer .",
    "interestingly , the peak value is exactly the same as that of the scattering polarization degree @xmath61 in the face - on case , which can be proven analytically for oblate grains .",
    "lastly , the emission polarization degree @xmath79 decreases smoothly with the inclination angle @xmath27 , reaching zero in the edge - on limit , when the oblate grains appear circular to the observer and thus there is no preferred direction for polarization .",

    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the relative contribution of scattering and direct emission to the polarization depends on not only the degree of polarization ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) , but also the ratio of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is mean intensity at the location under consideration , @xmath98 is the local source function for thermal dust emission , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the scattering and absorption cross sections .",

    "on the other hand , the electrostatic approximation that we adopted is valid only when the grain is relatively small compared to the wavelength .",

    ", we will leave the ratio @xmath107 as a free parameter , and explore the parameter space where the polarization from scattering becomes important relative to that from direction emission .",
    "since the polarization from direct emission at a location on the major axis is always along the major axis ( for a purely toroidal magnetic field ) , one way to measure the importance of the scattering is to determine the transition inclination angle @xmath108 beyond which the polarization is forced to align with the minor axis instead . in fig .",

    ", we set the scale factor for the total ( gas and dust ) column density to @xmath142 ( with a gas - to - dust - ratio of 100 ) , so as to prevent the optical depth for direct emission from becoming too large , especially at small radii , on the one hand and to make the optical depth for scattering large enough that the scattering can compete with direct emission in producing polarization on the other .",
    "the key parameter that we will focus on is the inclination angle @xmath27 , which is expected to change the balance between the polarization produced by scattering and that by direct emission , based on the analytic results described in ",
    "[ sec : electrostatic ] .",
    "we will start with the simplest , face - on case ( @xmath28 ) , which is free of any disk inclination effect . in this case , the polarization pattern for the direct emission from the oblate grains that are perfectly aligned with a purely toroidal magnetic field is trivial : the polarization direction is radial everywhere ( see upper - middle panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : ill ] ) .",
    "the pattern for the scattered light is more structured .",
    "the polarization direction is radial inside a radius of @xmath143  au ( this radius depends on the disk mass and temperature distributions ) , and becomes azimuthal outside ( see upper - left panel ) .",
    "this is very different from the pattern in the case of spherical grains ( see the top - left panel of fig .  2 of paper i ) , where the polarization direction is azimuthal everywhere , including at small radii , where the polarization fraction is small , because the incident radiation field at these radii is more or less isotropic in the disk plane .",
    "in contrast , for non - spherical grains , the scattered light can be significantly polarized even for ( planar ) isotropic incident radiation , as we demonstrated analytically in the last section ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : p_pol ] ) .",
    "since the oblate grains are aligned with their shortest axes along the azimuthal ( b - field ) direction , incident light coming from the radial direction ( with an electric field @xmath144 along the azimuthal direction ) is scattered less efficiently than that from the azimuthal direction ( with @xmath144 along the radial direction ) , leading to polarization along the radial direction at small radii where the incident radiation field in the disk plane is more or less isotropic . as the radius increases ,",
    "the incident radiation field becomes more beamed in the radial direction , which leads to the polarization along the azimuthal direction in the outer part of the disk .",
    "indeed , the incident radiation near the outer edge of the disk shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] is so beamed in the radial direction that the polarization fraction iof the scattered light s more than 50% .        despite the high polarization fraction , the polarized intensity of the scattered light is relatively low in the outer part in this particular example , so that the polarization of the combined light from both direct emission and scattering is in the radial direction everywhere ( see the upper right panel ) .",
    "the radial polarization pattern does not mean that the direct emission dominates the polarization everywhere .",
    "indeed , close to the center , the polarization is dominated by scattering .",
    "this illustrates the potential danger of automatically identifying radial polarization with the direct emission from grains aligned with a toroidal magnetic field in a face - on disk .",
    "other pieces of information , such as grain properties and disk radiation field , are needed to help determine unambiguously which polarization mechanism dominates .",
    "as the angle @xmath27 increases , the inclination - induced polarization in the scattered light becomes more important , which reduces the difference between the spherical and non - spherical grain cases ( compare the lower - left panel of fig .  2 of paper i with the middle - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] for the @xmath145 case ) . in particular , in the inner part of the disk where the incident radiation field in the disk plane is not far from being isotropic ,",
    "the scattered light is polarized more or less along the minor axis of the disk , which is the hallmark of the inclination - induced polarization ; it is very different from the radial pattern seen in the face - on case ( see the upper - left panel ) .",
    "in addition , both the ring of null polarization and the azimuthal polarization pattern in the outer part of the disk of the face - on case disappear , again because of the inclination - induced polarization .",
    "as emphasized in paper i for spherical grains , the tendency for the inclination - induced polarization in the scattered light to lie along the minor axis is a simple consequence of the ( thin ) disk geometry and maximum polarization at @xmath85 scattering angle for small grains . for locations on the major axis of a disk of inclination angle @xmath27 ,",
    "the incident radiation coming from the radial direction is scattered by @xmath85 into the line of sight , whereas that from the locally azimuthal direction ( i.e. , perpendicular to the local radial direction in the disk plane ) is scattered by @xmath146 or @xmath147 .",
    "this difference in scattering angle makes the polarization from the former , which is along the minor axis , more important relative to that from the latter .",
    "similarly , for locations along the minor axis , the incident light along the locally azimuthal direction is scattered by @xmath85 , and that along the radial direction ( in the disk plane ) by @xmath146 or @xmath147 .",
    "the difference increases the relative importance of the polarization from the former , which is again along the minor axis .",
    "this basic picture is qualitatively similar for both spherical and non - spherical grains .",
    "the polarization produced by direct emission is also affected by the disk inclination .",
    "although the polarization vectors remain perpendicular to the local toroidal magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky ( see the middle - middle panel for the @xmath145 case ) , the polarization fraction is changed significantly by the inclination , especially at locations on the major axis , where it is reduced compared to the face - on case , by a factor of about 2 for @xmath145 for the particular grain model with @xmath129 adopted here ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : p_pol ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , for locations on the minor axis , the aligned oblate grains appear `` edge - on '' to the observer independent of the inclination angle , and their polarization fraction remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , a generic feature of the polarization produced by the direct thermal emission of magnetically aligned oblate ( or effectively `` oblate '' , see appendix  [ sec : imp&geo ] for a discussion ) grains is that , as the inclination angle @xmath27 increases , the distribution of the polarization fraction becomes more non - uniform azimuthally , with the radiation on the minor axis becoming increasingly more polarized compared to that on the major axis .",
    "the degree of the contrast between the two axes depends sensitively on the grain axis ratio @xmath87 , which is unfortunately uncertain in general .",
    "the inclination - induced contrast between the polarizations produced by the direct emission on the major and minor axes is further increased when the scattering is also included ( see the middle - right panel ) .",
    "the main reason is that , for our particular grain model , the polarizations produced by direct emission and scattering are in orthogonal directions at locations on the major axis ( see the middle - left and middle - middle panels , see fig .  [",
    "fig : p_pol ] ) .",
    "it leads to a null point at a radius @xmath148  au on the major axis where the polarization from the scattering cancels that from the direct emission exactly .",
    "closer to the center , the polarization is dominated by the scattering ( which produces a higher polarized intensity in this particular example ) , with a direction along the minor axis ; the opposite is true beyond the null point ( although this is hard to see clearly in the middle - right panel because of low polarization fraction ) . in contrast , at locations on the minor axis , the polarizations from both direct emission and scattering are along the same direction ; they add to , rather than cancel , each other .",
    "the net result is a `` butterfly - shaped '' pattern for the polarized intensity .",
    "besides the strong azimuthal variation in the polarization fraction , there is also a significant radial dependence in the direction of the combined polarization . at relatively small",
    "radii ( within @xmath149  au ) , the polarization is dominated by scattering with direction more or less along the minor axis . at larger radii , the direct emission becomes more important , turning the polarization morphology into a more fan - like pattern .",
    "this example illustrates the potential richness of the interplay between the polarizations produced by scattering and direct emission in an inclined disk , even though the underlying magnetic field is simple ( purely toroidal ) : the combined polarization varies both radially and azimuthally and in both direction and polarization fraction .",
    "in particular , it includes a polarization `` hole , '' where the polarizations from the two competing mechanisms cancel each other .",
    "we should stress that , for this intriguing composite pattern to appear , the polarized intensities from the direct emission and scattering must be comparable . whether it can happen naturally is uncertain . in the discussion section , we will return to this and other issues , including the fact that the patterns of the polarization vectors appear very different in the scattering and emission cases for this intermediate inclination @xmath145 , which should be distinguished observationally .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] , we show the case of an even more inclined disk , with @xmath150 .",
    "not surprisingly , the inclination effect becomes more prominent for the polarizations produced by both scattering and direction emission .",
    "specifically , the polarization from scattering has a direction nearly parallel to the minor axis everywhere , and a polarization fraction close to the maximum value of @xmath0 ( see the lower - left panel ) .",
    "this pattern is similar to the highly inclined case with spherical grains , indicating that the effect of grain non - sphericity is largely masked by that of inclination . for the direct emission ,",
    "the polarization near the major axis is greatly reduced relative to that near the minor axis ( the lower - middle panel ) , producing a much more pronounced `` butterfly '' pattern than the @xmath145 case ( the middle - middle panel ) .",
    "the patterns of the polarized intensity are so distinct in the scattering and emission cases that one should be able to tell them apart observationally in principle . in practice",
    ", the characteristic `` butterfly '' pattern would be smeared out in disks with large inclination angles such as @xmath150 unless the distribution of the polarized intensity along the minor axis is well resolved spatially .",
    "such well resolved observations should also be able to reveal the difference in the polarization direction and thus help distinguish the two cases . the total polarization pattern for the highly inclined @xmath150 case including both emission and scattering is shown in the lower - right pattern .",
    "it appears very different from that of the intermediate inclination ( @xmath145 ) case ( the middle - right panel ) . in the @xmath145 case , the `` butterfly '' pattern in the polarized intensity is barely recognizable for the emission only case , but becomes much more prominent in the combined case , because the polarization produced by the emission along the major axis is largely canceled out by that produced by the scattering .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath150 case , the `` butterfly '' pattern is much more prominent for the emission only case , but completely disappears in the combined case , because the low polarized intensity region along the major axis ( the gap between the two `` wings of the butterfly '' ) is filled in by the scattering - produced polarization . in any case , the systematic change in polarization pattern from @xmath28 to @xmath151 to @xmath152 is driven mainly by the expected decrease of the polarization from emission along the major axis and the increase of that from scattering at the same time .",

    "if this interpretation is correct , the roughly north - south orientation of the molecular outflows would imply a disk major axis along approximately the east - west direction .",

    "we have found suggestive evidence that the dust scattering may have contributed significantly to the polarization observed in ngc1333 iras4a1 on the 50  au scale , especially in the central region and along the major axis . however , the concentration of the polarized light along the minor axis and the `` fanning out '' of most of the polarization vectors point to a polarization pattern dominated by the direct emission from grains aligned with respect to a toroidal magnetic field as the dominant mechanism , especially in the outer regions , with the strong implication that the disk is indeed magnetized .",
    "this is very different from the case of hl tau disk , where the polarized light is concentrated along the major axis , and all polarization vectors are more or less parallel to the minor axis @xcite . as emphasized in paper i ( see also @xcite ) , these features are explained more naturally by dust scattering than direct emission .",
    "these two examples illustrate the diversity of the polarization pattern on the disk scale and the need to include both scattering and direct emission for interpreting the observations .",
    "the need will only increase in the near future as alma disk polarization observations with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity become available .",
    "there are several factors that determine the relative importance of the scattering and emission in disk polarization , including the grain properties , disk structure and inclination .",

    "the case of iras4a1 is particularly interesting in this context . to produce significant polarization at 8  mm by dust scattering ,",
    "the grains must be roughly millimeter - sized ( or larger ) . in this source",
    ", there is evidence for polarization from direct emission as well .",
    "if the polarized emission is dominated by the same grains that are responsible for the scattering , it would imply that large , millimeter - sized , grains can indeed be aligned with respect to the magnetic field inside the disk .",
    "this inference is important because , compared to the micron - sized ( or smaller ) grains that are more commonly discussed in the grain - alignment literature , the much larger , millimeter - sized , grains are more difficult to align by radiative torque because of their slower internal relaxation @xcite and slower lamor precession around the field @xcite .",
    "the latter obstacle can in principle be overcome with a strong enough magnetic field .",
    "therefore , alignment of large grains can potentially provide an indirect estimate of the lower limit to the field strength that is all - important to the disk dynamics ; we will postpone the quantification of this limit to a future investigation .",
    "a potential complication is that the grains responsible for the scattering and direct emission may not have the same sizes .",
    "for example , in the case of iras4a1 , the central part of the disk where scattering appears to dominate the polarization may have large grains while the direct emission - dominated outer part could have smaller grains .",
    "indeed , there is evidence for such a spatial gradient , with the grain size increasing toward the center , from the distribution of opacity spectral index @xmath183 in a number of ( relatively evolved ) disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gradient is also expected on theoretical grounds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the inward increase in grain size tends to make the scattering - induced polarization more important at smaller radii ( in addition to a higher column density there ) , as appears to be the case in iras 4a , although the optical depth close to the center could be substantial , which may invalidate the optical thin approximation and single scattering assumption adopted in the paper .",
    "these effects should be treated self - consistently in more refined models in the future , together with the expected spatial variation of grain properties .",
    "another refinement is to include the polarization of the incident light in treating the scattering .",
    "if the observed polarization is dominated by direct emission from magnetically aligned grains , the polarization fraction may provide a handle on the grain shape .",
    "for perfectly aligned oblate spheroids , there is a one - to - one relation between the grain axis ratio @xmath87 and the maximum polarization fraction @xmath184 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : contrast ] ) .",
    "for example , values of @xmath185 and @xmath186 would imply axis ratios of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "however , the polarization could also be produced by prolate grains , whose optical properties are similar to those of the oblate grains when averaged around the magnetic field direction ( see appendix  [ sec : imp&geo ] )",
    ". furthermore , alignment with the magnetic field may not be perfect , especially for large grains with larmor precession time scales longer than the disk lifetime . for imperfectly aligned grains , larger deviation from spherical shape is needed to produce the same degree of polarization .",
    "therefore , there is a degeneracy between different grain shapes ( oblate vs prolate ) and between the grain shapes and their degrees of alignment that is difficult to break with the observed polarization fraction alone .",
    "grain growth models and detailed grain alignment calculations , together with higher resolution and sensitivity data , may be needed to break the degeneracy .",
    "using the electrostatic approximation , we have taken a first step toward developing a general theory for disk polarization in millimeter and centimeter that includes both direct emission from magnetically aligned , non - spherical grains and scattering by the same grains , with an emphasis on the relative importance of these two mechanisms and how they are affected by disk inclination .",
    "we have adopted the approximation of unpolarized incident light for scattering , which could affect the polarization produced by scattering at a level up to a few tens of percent ( see appendix [ sec : unpolarized ] ) . with this caveat in mind ,",
    "the main results are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the polarizations produced by scattering and direct emission both depend strongly on the disk inclination , which changes the relative importance of the two , especially along the ( projected ) disk major axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "this change was illustrated analytically with a simple case where oblate grains are perfectly aligned with a purely toroidal magnetic field at a location on the major axis where the incident radiation field is assumed isotropic ( see fig .",

    "for a nearly face - on disk , both scattering and direct emission produce polarization along the major axis ( or radial direction ) at the location ; they tend to reinforce each other . as the inclination angle @xmath27 increases , the direction of the scattering - induced polarization switches to the minor axis , with the polarization fraction increasing to @xmath0 as @xmath189 . in contrast",
    ", the polarization produced by direct emission remains along the major axis , with the polarization fraction decreasing monotonically to zero as @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , for large disk inclinations , the polarizations from scattering and direct emission tend to cancel each other on the major axis , with the scattering dominating the direct emission in the limit of edge - on disks . for less extreme disk inclinations , the relative importance of the two competing mechanisms depends on the properties of the dust grains , especially their size and degree of non - sphericity , and the ratio of the planck function @xmath190 for thermal dust emission and the mean intensity @xmath97 of the incident radiation field to be scattered by the grains .",
    "the scattering and direct emission by magnetically aligned , non - spherical grains produce polarization patterns that should be easily distinguishable in general but not always .",
    "this was illustrated with a geometrically and optically thin dust disk of a prescribed column density and temperature distribution and a purely toroidal magnetic field ( see fig .  [",

    "particularly intriguing is the pattern produced in a disk of intermediate inclination with the scattering dominating the inner region of the disk and the emission the outer : the polarization directions are nearly uniform ( along the minor axis ) at small radii , and become increasingly radial at larger distances , with two `` null '' points located on the major axis ( one on each side of the origin ) where the polarizations from scattering and direct emission cancel out exactly .",
    "the `` null '' points serve as a signpost for both mechanisms contributing significantly to the polarization .",
    "there is suggestive evidence that the polarization pattern observed in ngc1333 iras4a1 at 8  mm is shaped by a combination of direct emission and scattering .",
    "the scattering and direct emission naturally account for , respectively , the relatively uniform polarization directions observed in the central region and the roughly radial pattern at larger distances ( see fig .  [ fig : obs ] ) .",
    "most interestingly , there is clear evidence for at least one `` null '' point in the observed polarization map , which can naturally be interpreted as the location on the major axis of an inclined disk where the polarizations from the scattering and direct emission cancel each other .",
    "the implied disk orientation matches that required for launching the observed molecular outflows .",
    "if both direct emission and scattering from the same magnetically aligned grains indeed contribute significantly to the polarization observed in iras 4a1 , it would imply not only that a magnetic field exists on the disk scale , but that it is strong enough to align large , possibly millimeter - sized , grains , at least in this source , with potentially far reaching consequences for the disk dynamics and evolution .",
    "this inference remains tentative , however , in this early stage of observations and modeling of disk polarization .",
    "the situation should be greatly improved in the near future with the higher resolution and sensitivity alma observations and model refinements .",

    "in   [ subsec : oblate1 ] and [ subsec : oblate2 ] , we have considered in detail only oblate grains . for non - oblate grains that have their shortest axes aligned with the local magnetic field ,",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar to the oblate grain case , as a result of either rapidly grain rotation around the field line or averaging over an ensemble of grains .",
    "for example , consider prolate grains with the semi - diameters @xmath191 and intrinsic polarizability @xmath192 .",
    "let the minor axis @xmath31 be aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "the polarizability along the field direction remains unchanged ( i.e. , @xmath193 , where the subscript @xmath194 denotes `` parallel '' to the local magnetic field ) , whereas the two components perpendicular to the field become @xmath195 , which is the average over the azimuthal angle around the field line ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the effective ( averaged ) polarizabilities for the prolate grains become @xmath196 , which have the same ordering as the oblate grain case . in other words ,",
    "the averaging makes the prolate grains behave effectively as `` oblate '' grains as far as the polarization is concerned , although their efficiency in producing polarization is reduced somewhat compared to the oblate grains that have the same long - to - short axis ratio ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another potential complication is that the grains may not be perfectly aligned with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "for example , it is likely for the grains to wobble around the field line ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the wobbling is expected to be more important for larger grains , since their alignment is made less efficient by the longer larmor precession time .",
    "determining the degree of alignment requires a detailed study of the grain alignment mechanism , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we illustrate the effects of imperfect alignment through parametrization .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider oblate grains with the symmetric axis along the shortest axis @xmath31 .",
    "let the grain s shortest axis wobble around the local magnetic field , which is fixed in space , with an instantaneous polar angle @xmath197 and azimuthal angle @xmath51 with respect to the field direction . with a simple frame rotation , we can obtain the polarizability matrix in the lab frame , i.e. , the frame fixed with respect to the magnetic field ( rather than the wobbling grains ) . since the system is symmetric with respect to the field direction , we can average over the azimuthal angle @xmath51 , which leaves the elements of the polarizability matrix in the lab frame depending only on the polar angle @xmath197 : @xmath198 where @xmath199 represents a diagonal matrix and @xmath200 is an ensemble average .",
    "we can see that the matrix preserves the form of polarizability matrix of oblate grains with two equal components bigger than the third one .",
    "when @xmath201 , we recover the perfect alignment result . in the opposite limit of completely random grain orientation , we have @xmath202 , which yields @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the identity matrix . as expected , there would be no polarization from direct dust emission in this case , and the polarization would be completely dominated by scattering .",
    "this limiting case is an example of the general trend that imperfect grain alignment tends to increase the importance of scattering relative to direct emission .    to illustrate the above trend further",
    ", we consider how imperfect grain alignment , as parametrized by the value of @xmath200 , affects the transition inclination angle @xmath108 ( discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : oblate2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rratio ] ) where the polarization produced by scattering cancels that from direct emission completely , for the fiducial value of the ratio @xmath205 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ori ] . clearly , for each value of the axis ratio @xmath87 , the scattering starts to become important at a smaller inclination angle as the grain alignment becomes worse ( i.e. , as the parameter @xmath200 decreases ) .",
    "another way to interpret the curve for each @xmath87 in the figure is that , in order for the direct emission to dominate the total polarization , two conditions must be satisfied : ( 1 ) the inclination angle @xmath27 must be less than a critical value ( the value of the transition angle @xmath108 in the perfectly aligned limit ) , and ( 2 ) the grains must be sufficiently aligned so that the parameter @xmath200 is larger than the value at the intersection of the curve and the vertical line passing through the angle @xmath27 ) .",
    ", on the relative importance of scattering and direct emission for polarization for the case of @xmath206 . for each value of axis ratio @xmath87 ,",
    "the polarization is dominated by direct emission in the parameter space to the upper - left of the corresponding curve , and by scattering to the lower right .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in summary , in the presence of a magnetic field , the local field direction serves as a symmetry axis for the system .",
    "averaging around this axis makes non - oblate grains behave effectively as oblate grains regardless of their shape and degree of alignment .",
    "it provides a strong motivation to concentrate on oblate grains with different values of axis ratio @xmath87 , since the results in the more general cases will be qualitatively similar .",
    "the downside of the averaging is that there is a strong degeneracy between the degree of alignment , characterized by the quantity @xmath200 , and the degree of the grain non - sphericity , characterized by @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , imperfectly aligned `` needles '' might have similar optical properties as perfectly aligned `` pancakes , '' making it difficult to tell them apart based on polarization observations .",
    "here we evaluate the effect of the approximation of unpolarized incident light on the polarization produced by scattering . for a disk with a purely toroidal magnetic field",
    ", the incident radiation will be polarized along the @xmath32 direction , i.e. , the normal direction of the disk ( see the cartesian coordinate system defined in the second paragraph of   [ subsec : oblate1 ] ) , so that is stokes parameters @xmath207 . in this case , the polarization fraction of the scattered light can be estimated roughly as : @xmath208 where @xmath209 , and the brackets denote angle - averaging .",
    "the dust polarization fraction observed in young star disks is of order @xmath210 @xcite or less ( typically of order @xmath211 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if such low values are representative of the polarization fraction of the direct thermal emission , we would expect @xmath212 to be of this order as well , i.e. , @xmath213 .",
    "the factor @xmath214 in the denominator of the above equation is of the same order as @xmath212 , so we expect the correction term @xmath215 in the denominator to be of order @xmath216 , which is negligible .    the correction term in the numerator of equation  ( [ eq : correction ] ) is expected to be larger , because the ratio @xmath217 is typically of order a few ( rather than the much smaller @xmath212 ) .",
    "it is expected to affect the intensity of the scattering - produced polarized radiation at a few to a few tens of percent level .",
    "we do not expect the approximation of unpolarized incident light to significantly affect the polarization pattern produced by scattering , especially in the central region of an axisymmetric disk , where the incident radiation is nearly isotropic in the disk plane . in this case , the same angle - averaging as in section ",
    "[ subsec : oblate1 ] yields @xmath218 , which implies that the scattering of incident light polarized perpendicular to the disk will not produce any @xmath219 or @xmath220 component , just as in the case of unpolarized incident light ."
