    "the prediction @xcite of a _ dynamical phase transition _ upon increasing drive , from a fluidlike plastic flow regime @xcite to a coherently moving solid @xcite in a moving vortex lattice has motivated many recent theoretical @xcite , experimental @xcite , and simulation work @xcite . in a previous work",
    "we have studied the dynamical regimes in the velocity - force curve ( voltage - current ) in 2d thin films @xcite and found two dynamical phase transitions above the critical force .",
    "the first transition , from a plastic flow regime to a smectic flow regime , is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of a peak in differential resistance , isotropic low frequency voltage noise and maximum transverse diffusion .",
    "the second transition , from a smectic flow regime to a frozen transverse solid , is a freezing transition in the transverse direction where transverse diffusion vanishes abruptly and the hall noise drops many orders of magnitude . in other 2d simulations",
    "the peak in differential resistance was found to coincide with the onset of orientational order @xcite and a maximum number of defects @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the position of this peak was taken by hellerqvist _",

    "we show that in driven 3d layered superconductors , the peak in differential resistance also coincides with the onset of correlation along the c - axis .",

    "we simulate a stack of equally spaced superconducting layers with interlayer periodicity @xmath0 , each layer containing the same number of pancake vortices .",
    "the equation of motion for a pancake located in position @xmath1 ( with z - axis in c - direction ) is : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the in - plane and inter - plane distance between pancakes @xmath5 , @xmath6 and a pinning site at @xmath7 ( pancakes interact only with pinning centers within the same layer ) , @xmath8 is the bardeen - stephen friction , and @xmath9 is the driving force due to an applied in - plane current density @xmath10 .",

    "we take a pinning range of @xmath35 , pinning strengh of @xmath36 , with a density of pinning centers @xmath37 on each layer .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in all directions and the periodic long - range in - plane interaction is dealt with exactly using an exact and fast converging sum @xcite .",
    "the equations are integrated with a time step of @xmath38 and averages are evaluated in @xmath39 integration steps after @xmath40 iterations for equilibration ( when the total energy reaches a stationary value ) .",
    "each simulation is started at @xmath41 with an ordered triangular vortex lattice ( perfectly correlated in c - direction ) and slowly increasing the force in steps of @xmath42 up to values as high as @xmath43 .",
    "we start by looking at the vortex trajectories in the steady state phases . in figure 1(a - b ) we show a top view snapshot of the instantaneous pancake configuration for two typical values of @xmath44 . in figure 2(a - b ) we show the vortex trajectories @xmath45 for the same two typical values of @xmath44 by plotting all the positions of the pancakes in all the layers for all the time iteration steps . in fig .",

    "all the pancakes are pinned and there is no motion . at the characteristic force , @xmath52",

    "a typical situation is shown in fig .",
    "in this plastic flow regime we observe that the motion is completely uncorrelated along c - direction , with @xmath54 for @xmath55 as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 2(a ) we see that this situation corresponds to a disordered configuration of pancakes and to an uncorrelated structure of plastic channels along c - axis . at @xmath56",
    "there is an onset of correlation along the c - axis and pancakes vortices start to align forming well defined stacks or vortex lines .",
    "this onset of c - axis correlation corresponds to the transition from plastic flow to a moving smectic phase ( a complete discussion of the translational as well as temporal order will be discussed elsewhere @xcite ) .",

    "in a system with @xmath31 layers we have found that there is a clear onset of c - axis correlation with increasing driving force , where the pancake vortices start to align forming well defined stacks moving in smectic flow channels . below this transition , in the plastic flow regime , these stacks of pancakes are unstable . also , in @xcite an enhancement of c - axis correlations with increasing drive was observed in a bilayered system .",
    "we have further found @xcite that the in - plane properties are in well correspondence with the ones obtained in 2d thin films simulations @xcite",
    ". a better understanding of the effects of c - axis correlations in pancake motion on each layer can be obtained by studying translational and temporal order in larger systems , through the analysis of the structure factor , voltage noise , and in - plane @xcite as well as _",

    "we have analyzed the vortex correlation along the field direction ( c - axis ) in the velocity - force characteristics at @xmath28 and found that above the critical current there is an onset of c - axis correlation in the transition between a plastic flow regime to a smectic flow regime .",
    "this transition coincides with the peak in the differential resistance .",
