    "spatio - temporal modeling has received much attention in recent years . particularly , the rise in global temperature being a major environmental concern",
    ", scientists are now taking keen interest in the study of the dynamics of such climatic spatio - temporal processes@xcite .",
    "another closely related class of spatio - temporal processes , that are also of much importance to climatologists , are daily rainfall and precipitation ( like mist , snowfall etc . ) across a region . apart from climatology ,",
    "many important spatio - temporal processes are also associated with different subfields of environmental and ecological science . to mention a few , studies on ground level concentration of ozone , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and pm ,",
    "species distribution over a region , change in land usage pattern over time , etc .",
    "other than these areas , spatio - temporal models are also useful in geostatistics , hydrology , astrophysics , social science , archaeology , systems biology , and many more .",
    "so , knowledge of spatio - temporal modeling is becoming increasingly necessary for better understanding of a broad range of subjects .",
    "hence , it is of no wonder that practitioners from distant fields are working together to develop new and effective spatio - temporal models . in",
    "what follows , we review some such existing models , discuss some issues related to them and then propose a novel nonparametric model .",
    "then we devote the rest of the article to the development and exploration of the proposed model .",
    "finally , some simulated and real data analysis results are presented which shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for analysis of nonstationary spatial time series data .",
    "the proofs of all our mathematical results are deferred to the appendix .",
    "the term spatio - temporal data covers many different types of data .",
    "but here we consider only one specific type of spatio - temporal data .",
    "we consider that there are some arbitrary spatial locations @xmath2 and that the data have been observed at each of those spatial locations at times @xmath3 .",
    "such data sets are very common in the context of environmental science .",
    "one important example is ground level ozone data .",
    "an early approach for analysis of this type of data was based on stationary gaussian process . but",
    "this approach to modeling did not turn out to be adequate . since time differs intrinsically from space in that time moves only forward , while there may not be any preferred direction in space , time can not be treated simply as an additional co - ordinate attached with the spatial co - ordinates .",
    "another drawback of this approach is stationarity which is seldom satisfied by real , physical processes .",
    "so , alternative approaches to modeling spatio - temporal data were clearly necessary .",
    "briggs ( 1968)@xcite proposed a simple method for constructing spatio - temporal models , based on a purely spatial model . later ,",
    "cox and isham ( 1988)@xcite adopted a similar approach for modeling rainfall pattern .",
    "roughly , their idea was to start with a purely spatial stationary covariance kernel @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and construct a spatio - temporal stationary covariance kernel @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a random velocity vector and @xmath8 represents the time lag . in case",
    "the velocity vector is nonrandom , this model reduces to the classical frozen field model ( see page 428 of @xcite ) , which are useful for modeling environmental processes that are under the influence of prevailing winds or ocean currents . again",
    ", this model suffers from the oversimplified assumption of stationarity .",
    "sampson and guttorp ( 1992)@xcite proposed a nonparametric nonstationary model for analysing spatial data , based on spatial deformation .",
    "later , they extended it to the spatio - temporal setup@xcite .",
    "schmidt and ohagan ( 2003)@xcite gave a bayesian formulation of the model in the spatial setup .",
    "one basic problem with this approach is the requirement of replicates of the data , which is rarely available in practice .",
    "only very recently , anderes and stein ( 2008)@xcite came up with some idea on estimating such deformation model from a single realization .",
    "still , they considered only the spatial setup and implementing the model in real data problems requires solving a large and quite difficult optimization problem .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "a completely different approach to modeling spatio - temporal data is the convolution approach proposed by higdon et al .",
    "( 1999)@xcite . initially , they proposed it for purely spatial processes and later extended it to the spatio - temporal setup@xcite .",
    "several extensions and modifications of the convolution approach are adopted in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to start with a white noise process in space ( space - time ) and create a nonstationary spatial ( spatio - temporal ) process by convolving it with a spatially varying kernel .",
    "a different type of kernel convolution based non stationary spatial process was formed by fuentes and smith ( 2001)@xcite .",
    "they convolved a family of spatially varying locally stationary processes with a spatial kernel to build a nonstationary process .",
    "a more physically motivated approach to modeling the kind of spatio - temporal data considered here , is based on the dynamic linear model ( dlm ) introduced by west and harrison ( 1997)@xcite . such models are called dynamic spatio - temporal ( dstm ) models .",
    "stroud et al . ( 2001)@xcite proposed a dynamic spatio - temporal model for the analysis of tropical rainfall and atlantic ocean temperature .",
    "huerta et al . (",
    "2004)@xcite proposed a seasonal dynamic spatio - temporal model for the analysis of ozone levels . a more flexible dynamic spatio - temporal model with spatially varying state vector",
    "is proposed in banerjee et al .",
    "( 2005)@xcite .",
    "several other authors studied these models in the context of dimension reductions etc.@xcite .",
    "although dstms are used to incorporate the covariate information in spatio - temporal modeling , these models can also be used in the absence of covariates . the basic idea behind",
    "the dynamic approach is to model the observed spatio - temporal process as a linear state space model , where the coefficients associated with different covariates constitute the state vector .",
    "direct construction of nonstationary covariance functions is yet another approach . while paciorek and schervish ( 2006)@xcite directly construct a nonstationary covariance function in the spatial setup , fuentes ( 2001",
    ", 2002)@xcite proposed a spectral method .",
    "all the above mentioned approaches mainly focus on achieving nonstationarity .",
    "but nonseparability in space - time is also another important aspect in the context of space time modeling .",
    "roughly , nonseparability in space - time means that space effect and time effect interact in the formation of the process ; to rephrase , space effect depends on time effect and vice versa .",
    "although this is a highly realistic assumption , most of the spatio - temporal models existing in the literature assume separability . some works on nonseparable models can be found in @xcite . among them ,",
    "cressie and huang ( 1999 ) @xcite and gneiting ( 2002)@xcite considered nonseparability in the stationary setup while the others have developed spatio - temporal processes , which are both nonseparable and nonstationary .",
    "apart from the above mentioned approaches there are many more works in the context of spatio - temporal modeling .",
    "we attempted to provide only a broad overview and it is by no way exhaustive .",
    "first recall , that there are some arbitrary spatial locations @xmath2 and the data @xmath9 have been observed at those spatial locations at times @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the observed spatio - temporal process @xmath10 is driven by an unobserved spatio - temporal process @xmath11 which itself is evolving in time in some unknown way .",
    "so , we model them via the state space approach but instead of considering any known form of observational and evolutionary equations we allow them to be unknown . we propose a nonparametric state space based model , which can even capture the nonlinear evolution flexibly .",
    "we refer to it as a nonparametric state space based spatio - temporal model .",
    "our model has the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is a spatial gaussian process with appropriate parameters ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are temporally independent and identically distributed spatial gaussian processes , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are gaussian processes on @xmath20 .",
    "they are all independent of each other .    to elaborate ,",
    "let us consider a hierarchical break up of our model .",
    "suppose , that the observed process depends on the unobserved process through some unknown continuous function @xmath19 .",
    "then , for the purpose of bayesian inference we must put some prior on @xmath19 .",
    "hence , we put a gaussian process prior on @xmath19 .",
    "similarly we put a gaussian process prior on @xmath18 .",
    "this approach is able to capture arbitrary functional dependence between the observed and the latent variables , hence the term nonparametric . finally , to complete the model specification",
    ", we need to describe the parameters associated with the gaussian processes .",
    "we assume that the gaussian process @xmath21 has mean function of the form @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 are suitable parameters ) and has covariance kernel of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a positive definite function .",
    "it consists of parameters that determine the smoothness of the sample path of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover @xmath25 is such that the centered gaussian process associated with it has continuous sample paths .",
    "thus , we consider isotropic covariance functions with suitable smoothness properties .",
    "typical examples of @xmath25 are exponential , powered exponential , gaussian , matrn etc .",
    "( see , for example , table 2.1 of @xcite for other examples of such covariance kernels ) .",
    "similarly , parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are associated with the gaussian process @xmath28 .",
    "the zero mean gaussian processes associated with the noise variables have covariance kernels @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are also of the form as discussed above .",
    "regarding the gaussian process associated with @xmath15 , we assume a mean process of the form @xmath31 and isotropic covariance kernel @xmath32 . for convenience we introduce separate symbols for the mean vector and the covariance matrix associated with @xmath33 where @xmath2 are the spatial locations where the data are observed .",
    "we denote them by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "from ( [ eqn : npr1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : npr2 ] ) it is not difficult to see that our model boils down to simple dstm with no covariate if the process means associated with the gaussian processes @xmath19 and @xmath18 are given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the process variance ( denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) become 0 .",
    "the model equations ( [ eqn : npr1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : npr2 ] ) then reduce to the following forms @xmath40 where @xmath13 and @xmath41 .",
    "although we develop our gaussian process based spatio - temporal model for equi - spaced time points , simple modification of this model can handle non equi - spaced time points as well . however , for the sake of simplicity and brevity in this article we will confine ourselves only within the framework of equi - spaced time points .      before we proceed to explore the properties of our model",
    ", we need to ensure that a family of valid spatio - temporal stochastic processes is induced by the proposed model .",
    "only then physical processes can be modeled by it . in general such issues",
    "are almost always trivially satisfied and so , never discussed in detail .",
    "but in this case we need to show that @xmath42 are jointly measurable for any @xmath43 and any set of spatial locations @xmath44 , and this is not a trivial problem .",
    "the difficulty is that when @xmath45 and @xmath46 both are random , @xmath47 need not be a measurable or valid random variable .",
    "it is the sample path continuity of @xmath19 , which compels @xmath48 to be measurable .",
    "the following theorem establishes this mathematically .",
    "[ thm : measurable ] the model defines a family of valid ( measurable ) spatio - temporal processes on @xmath49 .",
    "once it is established that the proposed model induces a family of valid spatio - temporal processes , we look into some important properties like the joint distributions of state variables and observed variables , covariance structure of the observed process etc .",
    "an important point is that although we develop our model considering the space is @xmath50 all the results go through for @xmath51 @xmath52 as well .",
    "it is of importance to derive the joint distribution of the observed variables . as our model is based on an implicit hierarchical structure , the joint distribution of the observed variables is non - gaussian . but before going into the details , we need to derive the joint distribution of the state variables , which will also be required for our mcmc based posterior inference .",
    "[ thm : state]suppose that the spatio - temporal process is observed at locations @xmath2 for times @xmath3 . then the joint distribution of the state variables is non - gaussian and has the pdf    @xmath53 \\mathlarger{\\mathlarger{\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{nt}{2}}\\frac{1}{|\\tilde{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}|^\\frac{1}{2}}}}\\times$ ]    @xmath54 $ ]    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are already defined to be the mean vector and the covariance matrix of @xmath57 , and    @xmath58 + where the elements of @xmath59 are obtained from the purely spatial covariance function @xmath60 and the elements of @xmath61 are obtained from the covariance function @xmath62 in the following way + the @xmath63 th entry of @xmath59 is @xmath64 and the @xmath65 th entry of @xmath61 is @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    although the above density function has physical resemblance with a gaussian density , the involvement of @xmath69 in @xmath70 renders it non - gaussian . in the extreme case",
    "when the process variance @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) of the gaussian process @xmath18 is 0 , @xmath70 becomes a block diagonal matrix with identical blocks and the joint density becomes gaussian . in the formation of @xmath70",
    "the component @xmath73 corresponds to linear evolution and gaussianity whereas the component @xmath61 corresponds to nonlinear evolution and non - gaussianity .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the form of the density function that the temporal aspect is imposed through both the location function and the scale function associated with the latent process , making it more flexible .",
    "the interesting property that the joint density of the observed variables is also non - gaussian , follows from non - gaussianity of the joint distribution of the latent states .",
    "we have the following theorem in this regard .",
    "[ thm : observe ] suppose that the spatio - temporal process is being observed at locations @xmath2 for times @xmath3 .",
    "then the following hold true : + ( a ) the joint distribution of the observed variables is a gaussian mixture and has the following density    @xmath74    @xmath75\\mathlarger { h(\\mathbf{x } ) \\,d\\mathbf{x } } $ ] + where the mixing density @xmath76 is obtained by marginalizing the pdf derived at theorem [ thm : state ] with respect to the variables @xmath77 and the @xmath65 th entry of @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "+ ( b ) in the extreme case , when the process variance @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) of each of the gaussian processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are 0 , the joint distribution turns into gaussian .",
    "so , our method is very flexible in the sense that it can yield both gaussian and non - gaussian models for the observed data .",
    "non - gaussianity itself is of independent interest in the context of spatial modelling and some works in this direction are @xcite .      before delving into a deeper study of the covariance function and some related issues like nonstationarity and nonseparability",
    ", a more basic question is whether the process is light tailed , that is , whether or not all the coordinate variables have finite variance . from theorem [ thm : observe ]",
    "we see that the observed variables are distributed as a gaussian mixture and gaussian mixtures sometimes can give rise to heavy tailed distributions .",
    "so , an answer to the above question is not immediately available . in what follows",
    ", we first mathematically establish that the process is light tailed and then we show that the covariance function is nonstationary and nonseparable .",
    "[ thm : covariance ] ( a ) the observed spatio - temporal process @xmath10 is light tailed in the sense that all the coordinate variables have finite variance .",
    "+ ( b ) the covariance function @xmath84 of the observed spatio - temporal process is nonstationary and nonseparable for any @xmath85 .",
    "although we are able to show that our method yields nonstationary and nonseparable covariance function , it has an obvious drawback that no closed form expression for the covariance function is available .",
    "this problem , however exists in many other approaches including the convolution models , dstm models etc . , where a closed form covariance function is available only in very few special cases .",
    "actually , the direct construction of nonstationary covariance function is the only approach that yields a closed form covariance function .    moreover , from the prediction point of view , this is not a serious problem since what we need are the posterior predictive distributions at un - monitored locations at arbitrary points of time , which do not require closed form expressions of covariance functions .",
    "however , we still attempted to derive some closed form expression , and are partially successful in the sense that when our model is approximately linear ( in some suitable sense to be described later ) , the covariance function is approximately a geometric function of time lag .      here , in theorem",
    "[ thm : closed_covariance ] we show that if the process variances ( @xmath86 ) and ( @xmath87 ) are small then under some additional assumptions , the covariance function is approximately a geometric function of time lag .",
    "this result is mainly of theoretical interest and has nothing to do with the application of our model .",
    "[ thm : closed_covariance ] assume that @xmath88 .",
    "then for given @xmath89 arbitrarily small , @xmath90 such that for @xmath91 the covariance between @xmath10 and @xmath92 , denoted by @xmath84 is of following form    @xmath93c_{\\eta}(\\bold{s},\\bold{s}^*)\\right]-\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime } & \\leq c_{y}((\\bold{s},t),(\\bold{s^*},t^*))\\\\ & \\leq \\beta_{1g}^{|t - t^*|}\\left[c_{0}(\\bold{s},\\bold{s}^*)+[\\frac{1-\\beta_{1g}^{2(t^*+1)}}{1-\\beta_{1g}^2}]c_{\\eta}(\\bold{s},\\bold{s}^*)\\right]+\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      until now we have explored the finite dimensional distributions and properties of the spatio - temporal process @xmath10 . but finite dimensional properties alone are not sufficient to characterize any arbitrary general stochastic process",
    ". two stochastic processes with completely different sample path behaviour may have identical finite dimensional distributions and properties .",
    "we demonstrate this through the following simple example ( see also @xcite ) :    let us consider two spatio - temporal processes @xmath94 and @xmath95 defined on the same probability space @xmath96 ^ 2 $ ] in the following way : @xmath97 for all @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for all @xmath100 and @xmath101 otherwise . then one can show that for any fixed @xmath102 , @xmath94 has continuous sample path with probability @xmath103 whereas @xmath95 has discontinuous sample path with probability @xmath103 .",
    "now , we study the path properties of the proposed spatio - temporal process . the first part of the following theorem states that the observed spatio - temporal process has continuous sample path almost surely and in the second part it says that under additional smoothness assumptions regarding the covariance functions , the observed spatio - temporal process will have smooth sample paths almost surely .    [ thm : sample_path ] ( a ) the spatio - temporal process @xmath10 has continuous sample paths with probability @xmath103 .",
    "+ ( b ) assume that the covariance functions @xmath104 satisfy the additional smoothness assumptions that centered gaussian processes with these covariance functions will have almost surely @xmath105 times differentiable sample paths .",
    "then the spatio - temporal process @xmath10 will also have almost surely @xmath105 times differentiable sample paths .",
    "the first part of the above theorem states that almost always the spatial surface induced by our model at any time point @xmath102 is continuous .",
    "so , unless the spatial surface is extremely irregular , any spatio - temporal data can be modeled reasonably adequately by our proposed spatio - temporal process . a stronger statement , however ,",
    "is made in the second part of the theorem .",
    "it says that if the covariance functions @xmath106 are sufficiently regular ( smooth ) then the sample paths of the process @xmath10 are almost always regular ( smooth ) and their degrees of smoothnes depend on the degree of smoothness of the covariance functions . as an illustration",
    "consider the situation when all the covariance function belong to the matrn family whose smoothenes parameter is @xmath107 .",
    "then the sample paths of the centered gaussian processes with the respective covariance functions will be almost surely @xmath108 times differentiable , where , for any @xmath109 , @xmath110 denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to @xmath109 .",
    "so , the spatio - temporal process @xmath10 will also have almost surely @xmath108 times differentiable sample paths . hence , when we have clear evidence from the data or prior knowledge regarding the degree of smoothness of the spatio - temporal process we should choose all the covariance functions @xmath111 from the matrn family with specific value of @xmath107 .",
    "now we illustrate how our model can be used to make prediction at new spatio - temporal coordinates .",
    "firstly , let us specify the prior structure .",
    "we consider bivariate gaussian priors for each of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "although any reasonable isotropic covariance kernel that satisfy the mild regularity conditions already mentioned in section [ sec : our_proposal ] can be used in our model , for the sake of simplicity we consider the squared exponential covariance kernel with the following representation @xmath114 . since , we have five covariance kernels @xmath111 we need to put prior on five scale parameters @xmath115 and five smoothness parameters @xmath116 .",
    "we consider lognormal priors for all of them .",
    "also , we have taken @xmath117 prior for the vector parameter @xmath34 .",
    "all the priors considered above are mutually independent .    with the prior specification as above and the conditional densities",
    "@xmath118 $ ] and @xmath119 $ ] being explicitly available ( @xmath120 denotes the vector of all the parameters ) we design a gibbs sampler with gaussian full conditionals for @xmath34 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 and metropolis steps for scale parameters @xmath121 and smoothness parameters @xmath122 .",
    "we update the latent state vector @xmath123 using transformation based markov chain monte carlo ( tmcmc ) introduced by dutta and bhattacharya ( 2014)@xcite . in particular , we use the additive transformation which has been shown by dutta and bhattacharya ( 2014)@xcite to require less number of  moves types \" compared to other valid transformations .",
    "the idea of tmcmc is very simple yet a very powerful one .",
    "here we briefly illustrate the idea of additive tmcmc by contrasting it with the traditional random walk metropolis ( rwm ) approach , assuming that we wish to update all the variables simultaneously .",
    "suppose that we want to simulate from the conditional distribution @xmath124 $ ] using the rwm approach .",
    "then we have to simulate @xmath125 independent gaussian random variables @xmath126 ; assuming that the current state of the markov chain is @xmath127 , we accept the new state @xmath128 with probability @xmath129}{[\\mathbf{x}_{nt}^{(i)}|\\tilde{\\theta}]}\\right\\}$ ] .",
    "however if @xmath125 is large then this acceptance probability will tend to be extremely small .",
    "hence the rwm chain sticks to a particular state for very long time and therefore the convergence to the posterior @xmath124 $ ] is very slow .",
    "what additive tmcmc does is simulate only one @xmath130 from some arbitrary distribution left - truncated at zero , and then form the @xmath125 dimensional vector @xmath131 setting the @xmath105-th element independently to @xmath132 with probability @xmath133 and @xmath134 with probability @xmath135 . for our applications we set @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 .",

    "dutta and bhattacharya ( 2014)@xcite , dey and bhattacharya ( 2014a)@xcite , dey and bhattacharya ( 2014b)@xcite provide details of many advantages of tmcmc ( in particular , additive tmcmc ) as compared to traditional mcmc ( in aprticular , rwm ) .",
    "however , in our setup , we have not used tmcmc directly .",
    "instead , we simulated @xmath140 independent @xmath141 each to update @xmath43 latent observations corresponding to time @xmath102 .",
    "this may be called a block tmcmc and it improves mixing significantly over ordinary tmcmc . in our model dimension of the state vector is large and updating it using usual rwm would have been very inefficient .",
    "tmcmc saves us from such pitfall .",
    "using the above sampling - based approach we study the posterior distribution of the unknown quantities and make inferences regarding the parameters .",

    "this somewhat concentrated prior provides safeguard against ill - conditioning of the relevant covariance matrices during mcmc iterations  indeed , free movement of the smoothness parameters in their respective parameter spaces for mcmc pusposes can make the covariance matrices @xmath70 and @xmath78 drastically ill - conditioned . in making the above selection of hyper parameters we have extensively used mcmc pilot runs based on a smaller subset of the entire dataset .",
    "since , due to smaller sizes of the data sets the pilot runs were much faster , we were able to experiment with many such pilot mcmc runs with different combinations of the hyper parameters .",
    "we chose that combination with smallest deviation of the posterior predictive median surface from the true data surface in terms of total absolute deviation .",

    "the average length of the @xmath180 bayesian prediction interval being 20.25 indicates that the results are encouraging .",

    "figures 1(e ) and 1(f ) confirm that our model is also successful in terms of prediction at the temporal level .",
    "+    while figures 1(a)-1(f ) display the performance of our model in terms of prediction , figures 2(a)-2(f ) focus on the issue of capturing the true , underlying correlation structure .",
    "the figures display the posterior distribution of the correlation function @xmath186 for different choices of @xmath187 .",
    "the true value and the @xmath180 bayesian credible interval are also depicted in the figures . as is evident from the diagrams ,",
    "the true values lie well within the respective @xmath180 bayesian credible intervals , vindicating reasonable performance of our model in terms of capturing the true correlation structure .",
    "hence , in summary , this simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our model for the purpose of prediction as well as for learning about the true correlation structure .      in the previous section we described how our model performs when the data is simulated from our own model .",
    "but , now we describe a simulation study where the data is generated from a nonlinear non - gaussian state space model which is completely different from our model .",
    "let us first describe our data generation method .",
    "we consider a square of length @xmath163 and generate @xmath164 random locations inside it .",
    "then we simulate a spatial time series of length @xmath164 at those points using the following nonlinear state space model :    @xmath188    where @xmath13 and @xmath41 . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are temporally independent and identically distributed spatial gaussian processes with squared exponential covariance kernel .",
    "the corresponding scale parameters are @xmath189 and the smoothness parameters are @xmath190 .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath35 is also generated by a squared exponential covariance kernel with scale and smoothnes parameters @xmath191 and @xmath192 respectively .",
    "+    as is evident from the above figures the evolutionary transformation @xmath193 is highly nonlinear over the range of @xmath194 , which serves our purpose .",
    "our prior specification is very similar to the previous simulation study , where we have taken diffused normal priors for the location parameters and lognormal priors for the scale and smoothness parameters .",
    "we have taken sufficiently large burn - in and convergence of the chain is confirmed via visual monitoring .",
    "the computation is a bit time consuming with almost 60,000 iterations per day in a standard laptop .",
    "this is however natural for dynamic models , as they are so high - dimensional . in the following set of figures",
    "we describe how our model performs in terms of prediction .",
    "+   +   +    a brief description of section [ fig : subfigures4 ] follows .",
    "panel ( a ) displays the leave - one - out 95% bayesian prediction interval for all of the @xmath164 spatial locations at time point @xmath195 .",
    "the upper and lower quantiles ( which form the intervals ) are interpolated to form two surfaces .",
    "the middle surface is obtained by interpolating the leave - one - out point predictions ( which is the median in this case ) at the monitoring sites @xmath196 for time point @xmath195 .",
    "panel ( b ) displays once again the the leave - one - out 95% bayesian prediction interval for all of the @xmath164 spatial locations but this time the middle surface is interpolated through the truly observed data ( the truly observed data being represented by black dots ) .",
    "panel ( c ) and panel ( d ) display plots similar as ( a ) and ( b ) but for time point @xmath197 .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) depict the leave - one - out 95% bayesian prediction interval for the time series at spatial locations @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "the starred curve represents the curve interpolated through the truly observed data ( the observed data itself being represented by star ) and the plain curves represent respectively the upper , middle and lower quantiles associated with the posterior predictive distributions .    from the above set of figures it is evident that our model performs very well even though the data arose from a completely different model .",
    "air pollution over large geographical regions is a topic of wide range of studies involving statistics and other disciplines . among them",
    "statistical modeling of pollution caused by @xmath200 draws considerable attention .",
    "here we consider a @xmath200 precipitation dataset over great britain and france .",
    "the dataset consists of monthly measurement of sulphur dioxide precipitation taken at @xmath201 monitoring stations spread over great britain and france , starting from april 1999 to january 2001 .",
    "this dataset is a part of data collected through the ` european monitoring and evaluation programme ' ( emep ) which co - ordinates the monitoring of airborne pollution over europe .",
    "further information is available at , the website from which we have obtained the data set .",
    "first we consider some exploratory analysis based on the dataset .",
    "it is important to note that instead of direct measurement what we have is the measurement of natural logarithm of @xmath200 precipitation for these stations .",
    "+    we plot the station wise time series in a single figure and we see clear seasonal component and a very mild decreasing trend in most of the time series plotes shown in panel ( b ) of figure [ fig : subfigures5 ] .",
    "then we estimate the trend and seasonal component of each of the time series separately using simple descriptive techniques and detrend and deseasonalize them .",
    "finally , we model the residual spatio - temporal data using our method .",
    "the prior structure used in the real data analysis is similar to that of the simulation study .",
    "we used diffused bivariate normal priors for @xmath112 and @xmath113 and lognormal priors for all the other parameters .",
    "since the monitoring stations are spread over a large geographical region and distance stretches horizontally as latitude increases , the use of simple longitude and latitude as spatial coordinates would not be appropriate .",
    "the lambert ( or schmidt ) projection addresses this problem by preserving the area .",
    "this projection is defined by the transformation of longitude and latitude , expressed in radians as @xmath202 and @xmath203 , to the new co - ordinate system @xmath204 . however , with respect to the temporal coordinate we simply take one month as one unit of time .",
    "we implemented an mcmc chain with sufficiently large burn - in ; visual inspection suggests satisfactory convergence .",
    "based on the mcmc samples we calculated leave - one - out posterior predictive distributions of @xmath205 at each of the monitoring stations for all the months ranging from april 1999 to january 2001 .",
    "we calculated the @xmath180 bayesian prediction interval associated with the leave - one - out posterior predictive distribution for each of the @xmath206 space time coordinates .",
    "more than @xmath180 of the data fell within the respective prediction interval .    in figures 6(a)-6(c ) we provide the 95% bayesian prediction intervals associated with the leave - one - out posterior predictive distributions for time series of length @xmath207 for different spatial locations .",
    "these three plots show that our model performs satisfactorily also in terms of prediction at purely temporal level .    similarly , in figure 7(a)-7(i )",
    "we display the contourplots of the leave - one - out posterior point prediction surface , along with the contourplot of the true data surfaces for different months .",
    "the contour plots clearly show that our model performs very well in terms of point prediction .",
    "we also display the interval prediction through the combined plot of the interpolating surfaces of the upper quantiles , the true data and the lower quantiles , for the corresponding months .",
    "overall , this shows that our model performs well in terms of both point prediction and interval prediction at purely spatial level .",
    "+     +   +    one point to be noted here is that we have fitted our model to the residual space - time dataset ( after detrending and deseasonalizing the original dataset ) , not to the original @xmath205 measurements .",
    "so , while doing posterior prediction ( or leave - one - out posterior prediction ) at a space - time location , we needed to add back the trend and seasonal components to obtain the correct predictions .",
    "only then we can compare the posterior prediction and the true value at any particular space - time location .",
    "a very important aspect of such space - time data is covariate information .",
    "although in this article , we only consider model without any covariate information , it can be easily incorporated in our setup . in that case",
    "our model will be of the following form : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the covariate process and @xmath210 is now a gaussian processes on @xmath50 .",
    "the rest of the theory remains the same as before .",
    "in fact , we can have @xmath105 different covariate processes @xmath211 , in which case @xmath212 will be a gaussian process on @xmath213 .",
    "another direction for extension is time varying nonparametric state space model . in that case",
    "we let the evolutionary and observational transformations vary with time , so that our model assumes the form : @xmath214 such modification is particularly useful when the time interval on which we are observing the data is very wide so that it is unlikely for the functions @xmath45 and @xmath215 to remain invariant with respect to time . in the context of purely temporal nonparametric state space models ,",
    "@xcite consider time - varying functions @xmath216 and @xmath217 , which they re - write as @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "in other words , they consider the time component as an argument of their random functions @xmath45 and @xmath215 , which are modeled by gaussian processes in the usual manner .",
    "such ideas can be easily adopted in our spatio - temporal model .",
    "currently , we are working on these extensions .",
    "one common problem in the context of space - time data is missing observations .",
    "malfunction of monitoring device , inexperienced handling etc . , may lead to such problem .",
    "so , any good spatio - temporal model should take care of missing data . in our case",
    "it is very simple .",
    "we augment the latent variable ( say @xmath144 ) corresponding to the missing observation with @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "then we can predict the missing observation @xmath142 in the same way we make prediction at a new spatio - temporal coordinate ( see section @xmath220 ) .",
    "thus , prediction at a new spatio - temporal co - ordinate and missing data are taken care of simultaneously in our model .",
    "although we have developed a new nonstationary model , we have not done any comparative study with respect to to other existing nonstationary models ( mentioned in section @xmath163 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these nonstationary models are built on entirely different philosophies and hence are not comparable . for example , the nonstationary model developed in @xcite depends heavily on the choice of kernel and may outperform the nonstationary model developed in@xcite depending on whether some particular kernel is being used .",
    "in fact , dou and zidek ( 2010 ) @xcite , while comparing two different methods for analyzing hourly ozone data expressed similar view ( see page 1209 ) . similarly , our model , which is built on the idea of state space models is not comparable at all with the nonstationary models that are based on the ideas of kernel convolution or deformation .",
    "in fact , our model is not even comparable with dstm , another model based on the idea of state space .",
    "the reason behind it is that although our model reduces to the no - covariate dstm model if @xmath36 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , in spirit it is entirely different from dstm models , which are generally used to utilize covariate information in improving the prediction .",
    "indeed , our objective is to utilize unobserved information to enhance prediction .",
    "both of these models fall in the category of state space models , but the motivation behind them are quite different .",
    "dstm models are much more like spatio - temporal regression modeling where the linear regression structure varies with time ( varying coefficient linear regression ) .",
    "the research of the first author is fully funded by csir spm fellowship , govt . of india .",
    "the authors thank ` european monitoring and evaluation programme ' ( emep ) for the @xmath200 dataset .",
    "they also thank moumita das for many fruitful discussions on this article .",
    "before proving the theorems let us make a notational clarification . the notations @xmath223,[\\bold{x}|\\bold{y}]$ ] and",
    "@xmath224 $ ] are equivalent and throughout this section they will denote the value of conditional pdf of @xmath225 given @xmath226 at @xmath227 .    for this proof",
    "we assume that there exist continuous modifications of the gaussian processes that we consider , that is , there exist processes with sample paths that are continuous everywhere , not just almost everywhere , and that our gaussian processes equals such processes with probability one ( see , for example , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "existence of such continous modifications are guaranteed under the correlation structure that we consider for our gaussian processes .",
    "let us first notice that , @xmath228 a probability space @xmath229 such that @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the space of all real valued continuous functions on @xmath20 and @xmath232 is the borel sigma field obtained from the topology of compact convergence on the space @xmath231 .",
    "such a joint measurability result need not hold unless @xmath28 and @xmath233 are independent .",
    "now , we will show that @xmath234 is a measurable real valued function or a proper random variable . to show this ,",
    "first see that @xmath235 can be written as @xmath236 where @xmath237 is a transformation such that , @xmath238 where @xmath215 is a real valued continuous function on @xmath20 and @xmath109 is a real number .",
    "@xmath237 is a continuous transformation where the topology associated with @xmath231 is the topology of compact convergence and the topology associated with @xmath20 is the usual euclidean distance based topology on real numbers .",
    "[ lem : measurable ]    let us consider the metric @xmath239}{|g(x)-g^\\prime(x)|}}{1+\\sup\\limits_{x\\in[-i , i]}{|g(x)-g^\\prime(x)|}}}$ ] .",
    "this metric induces the topology of compact convergence on the space @xmath231 . to prove continuity of @xmath140",
    "one needs to show that @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "+ let us assume that @xmath240 and @xmath242 .",
    "so , @xmath243 and @xmath244 such that @xmath245 , @xmath246 $ ] .",

    "+ but , @xmath249}{|g_{n}(x)-g(x)| } + { |g(x_{n})-g(x)|}\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rhs goes to @xmath168 as @xmath250 .",
    "hence , @xmath251 .",
    "once continuity of @xmath140 is proved , note that @xmath252 , for any open set @xmath253 , is an open set in the product topology on the space @xmath254 .",
    "hence , @xmath252 belongs to the borel sigma field generated by this product topology which is in this case equivalent to the product sigma field @xmath255 associated with @xmath256 .",
    "this equivalence holds because both of the spaces @xmath231 and @xmath20 are separable . but @xmath257 is measurable with respect to @xmath258 and @xmath259 . hence , the inverse image of @xmath252 with respect to @xmath257 is in @xmath260 .",
    "so , the inverse image of any open set @xmath253 with respect to @xmath234 is in @xmath260 .",
    "this proves the measurability of @xmath234 .",
    "following exactly same argument as above we can further prove that @xmath261 are jointly measurable .",
    "now , as @xmath262 is independent of @xmath28 and @xmath233 , we have the joint measurability of @xmath263 ( see [ eqn : npr2 ] ) .",
    "infact , we can prove that @xmath264 are jointly measurable . to do it we consider @xmath265 such that @xmath266 where @xmath215 is a real valued continuous function on @xmath20 and @xmath109 is a real number .",
    "then similarly as in case of @xmath140 we can prove that @xmath267 is also a continuous map which immediately implies that @xmath268 are jointly measurable .",
    "then @xmath262 being independent of @xmath28 and @xmath233 , implies the joint measurability of @xmath264 .",
    "hence , starting with the joint measurability of @xmath269 we prove the joint measurability of @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "similarly , if we start with joint measurability of @xmath264 we can prove the joint measurability of @xmath270 .",
    "thus , the joint measurability of the whole collection of state variables @xmath271 @xmath272 is mathematically established .",
    "now , to prove joint measurability of the collection of observed variables @xmath273 @xmath274 recall the observational equation ( 1 ) .",
    "since , @xmath21 takes values in @xmath275 just as @xmath28 , and also since @xmath276 is independent of @xmath277 just as @xmath262 is independent of @xmath28 , all the previous arguments go through in this case and joint measurability of @xmath273 @xmath272 is established .    finally , it remains to show that a valid spatio - temporal process is induced by this model .",
    "but it is immediate from the application of kolmogorov consistency theorem .",
    "the consistency conditions of the theorem are trivially satisfied by our construction and hence the result follows .    in the previous proof",
    ", we needed to assume the continous modification of the underlying gaussian process . here",
    "we consider a proof where the underlying gaussian process need not be continuous .",
    "in fact , the alternative proof that we now provide is valid even if the underlying process admits at most countable number of discontinuities .",
    "note that it is possible to represent any stochastic process @xmath278 , for fixed @xmath279 as a random variable @xmath280 , where @xmath281 ; @xmath282 being the set of all functions from @xmath140 into @xmath283 . also , fixing @xmath281 , the function @xmath284 , represents a path of @xmath285 .",

    "<S> , we introduce a state space based nonparametric nonstationary model for the analysis of spatio - temporal data . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that there are some fixed spatial locations ( generally called the monitoring sites ) and that the data have been observed at those locations over a period of time . to model the data we assume that the data generating process is driven by some latent spatio - temporal process , which itself is evolving with time in some unknown way . </S>",
    "<S> we model this evolutionary transformation via compositions of a gaussian process and also model the unknown functional dependence between the data generating process and the latent spatio - temporal process ( observational transformation ) by another gaussian process . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this model in detail , explore the covariance structure and formulate a fully bayesian method for inference and prediction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply our nonparametric model on two simulated data sets and a real data set and establish its effectiveness . + _ keywords : _ observational equation ; evolutionary equation ; gaussian process ; state - space model ; mcmc ; gibbs sampler ; posterior predictive distribution . </S>",
