    "it is well known that the study of heavy quarkonia lead to a great boost in the understanding of qcd @xcite .",
    "this is connected to the fact that heavy quarkonia contains all manifestations of qcd . at the same time",
    "heavy quarkonia are nonrelativistic systems what makes the physics of heavy quarkonia much simpler that that for other mesons .",
    "for this reason so far the study of heavy quarkonia in different experiments is very important and intensive .",
    "the study of heavy quarkonia production processes is based on the fact that the mass of heavy quark inside quarkonia is much larger than characteristic qcd energy scale ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this fact leads to the appearance of small parameter  the relative velocity of quark - antiquark pair inside quarkonia @xmath2 . for the charmonia mesons this parameter is @xmath3 , for bottomonia mesons @xmath4 .",
    "the appearance of the small parameter separates different energy scales involved in quarkonia physics and allows to build a rigorous formalism for studying quarkonia properties which is called nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "nrqcd is based on the separation of different energy scales through the factorization theorem @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the amplitude of the process @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the wilson coefficients which parametrize the physics of small distances , @xmath9 are different nrqcd operators which contribute to the process .",
    "the sum in ( [ fact1 ] ) is infinite and it runs over all possible operators with correct quantum numbers . in particular , for the production of the @xmath10 meson the following operators contribute @xmath11 however , if we restrict the study of the process under consideration by some power of relative velocity @xmath12 then only finite number of the nrqcd operators contibute to ( [ fact1 ] ) . in particular , at the leading order approximation in relative velocity only the @xmath13 operator contributes .    if we omit the operators which assumes that quarkonia consist of more than quark - antiquark pair ( for instance , @xmath14 ) then factorization theorem ( [ fact1 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form    @xmath15    where the matrix elements @xmath16 which control relativistic corrections can be written as follows @xmath17 the first few matrix elements @xmath18 for the @xmath19 charmonia mesons where calculated within qcd sum rules in papers @xcite .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath8 which parametrize short distance contribution to the amplitude can be expanded in the strong coupling constants @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 the first aim of the present report is the description of the algorithm of analytical calculation of the coefficient @xmath22 for any process .      if a heavy quarkonium production process contains energy scale @xmath23 which is much larger than the masses of final mesons , one can apply light cone expansion formalism ( lcf ) to study such process @xcite . for instance",
    ", lcf can be applied if the energy of @xmath24 beam is much larger than the masses of charmonia mesons , what takes place at b - factories .",
    "the presence of high energy scale @xmath23 , which is of order of characteristic energy of the hard exclusive process , allows one to apply factorization theorem for the amplitude of the process ( [ fact1 ] ) . as in the case of nrqcd ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath8 describe partons production at small distances , the matrix elements @xmath25 describe hadronization of the partons which takes place at large distances . the sum is taken over all possible operators @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , the operators @xmath27 are few examples of the operator @xmath26 .",
    "actually , there are infinite number of the operators @xmath26 that contribute to the pseudoscalar meson production .",
    "the cross section of hard exclusive process can be expanded in the inverse powers of the high energy scale @xmath23 @xmath28 to determine if some operator contributes to a given term in @xmath29 expansion one uses the concept of the twist of this operator @xcite .",
    "thus only the leading twist  the twist-2 operators",
    "@xmath30 here is lightlike fourvector @xmath31 . ]",
    "contribute to the leading term in expansion ( [ exp ] ) . from this one",
    "sees that already at the leading order approximation infinite number of operators contribute to the cross section .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to cope with infinite number of contributions if one parametrizes all the twist-2 operators by the moments of some function @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the momentum of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath10 , @xmath35 is the constant which is defined as @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the fraction of momentum of the whole meson @xmath10 carried by quark .",
    "the function @xmath32 is called the leading twist distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "one can think of it as about the fourier transform of the wave function of the meson @xmath10 with lightlike distance between quarks . using the definition of this function , factorization theorem ( [ fact1 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hard part of the amplitude , which describes small distance effects .",
    "this part of the amplitude can be calculated within perturbative qcd . as it was noted , the leading twist da parametrizes infinite set of the twist-2 operators .",
    "this part of the amplitude describes hadronization of quark - antiquark pair at large distances and parametrizes nonperturbative effects in the amplitude .",
    "da of charmonia mesons were studied in papers @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that formula ( [ amp ] ) resums the contributions of all twist-2 operators . if the meson @xmath10 is a nonrelativistic meson , formula ( [ amp ] ) resums relativistic corrections to the amplitude @xmath6 . it should be also noted that if one takes into account the renormalization group running of the da @xmath32 , formula ( [ amp ] ) resums all leading logarithmic corrections to the amplitude of the process under considerations .",
    "the second aim of the present report is the description of the algorithm of analytical calculation of the hard part of the amplitude @xmath40 for any process .",
    "another example is hadronic production of @xmath41-wave charmonium states at high energies . in nrqcd",
    "formalism @xmath0 mesons are considered as nonrelativistic quark - antiquark pairs in color singlet ( cs ) or color octet ( co ) states @xmath42}\\right]\\right\\rangle + {",

    "subprocess[diags ] ]    in high energy limit gluon - gluon interactions give the main contributions to hadronic production of @xmath46-mesons ( see diagrams shown in fig.[diags ] ) . to obtain the analytic expressions for",
    "the amplitudes of these processes one can write down the amplitude for @xmath47 pair production in the reaction @xmath48 and project it on the corresponding state .",
    "for example , in the case of color - singlet @xmath49 meson one have the expression @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the momentum of final charmonium meson , relative momentum of quarks and spin polarization vector .",
    "the main idea of the algorithm for analytical calculation within nrqcd and lcf is based on the factorization theorem ( [ fact1 ] ) .",
    "this theorem allows us to make factorization in the calculation of the amplitude which consists in the following .",
    "the amplitude is devided into two part .",
    "the first part parametrizes the small distance contribution .",
    "the calculation of this part is reduced to the calculation of some set of feynman diagrams .",
    "the second part of the amplitude describes hadronization of quarks . in the calculation",
    "it is reduced to the some projection operators . in order to get total amplitude",
    "these two parts are convoluted by dirac and color indices .",
    "to carry out the calculation we use the mathematica package feyncalc @xcite for analytical calculation in high energy physics .",
    "as an example let us consider analytical calculation of @xmath54 matrix elements , which can be used to build the whole amplitude of the processes @xmath55 .",
    "the calculation will be carried out within lcf .",
    "analogously one can repeat the algorithm for nrqcd .    the program which realizes the algorithm starts from the kinematics    * there is no transverse motion in the meson h ( @xmath56 ) * the @xmath57-quark momentum is @xmath58 , the @xmath59-antiquark momentum @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) * the relative momentum of quark - antiquark pair is @xmath62    and the definitions of momenta involved in the process +   + * p[a _ ] = fourvector[p , a ] ; ( * h - momentum * ) + p1[a _ ] = x1*fourvector[p , a ] ; ( * p1=x1*p quark momentum * ) + p2[a _ ] = x2*fourvector[p , a ] ; ( * p2=x2*p antiquark momentum * ) + k[a _ ] = fourvector[k , a ] ; ( * photon momentum * ) + a[a _ ] = fourvector[a , a ] ; ( * photon polarization * ) +   + scalarproduct[k , k ] = 0 ; + scalarproduct[p , p ] = 0 ; + scalarproduct[p1 , p1 ] = 0 ; + scalarproduct[p2 , p2 ] = 0 ; + scalarproduct[p , k ] = s/2 ; + scalarproduct[p1 , k ] = x1*s/2 ; + scalarproduct[p2 , k ] = x2*s/2 ; + scalarproduct[a , k ] = 0 ; +   + ( * dirac matrixes * ) + hp = gs[p ] ; + hp1 = x1*gs[p ] ; + hp2 = x2*gs[p ] ; + hk = gs[k ] ; + ha = gs[a ] ; + * + after the definitions one can calculate the first part of the amplitude ",
