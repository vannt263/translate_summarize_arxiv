    "the field of quantum information , which extends and generalizes the classical information theory , is currently attracting enormous interest in view of its fundamental nature and its potentially revolutionary applications to computation and secure communication @xcite . among the various schemes for physical implementation of quantum computation @xcite ,",
    "those based on photons @xcite have the advantage of using very robust and versatile carriers of quantum information .",
    "however , the absence of practical single - photon sources and the weakness of optical nonlinearities in conventional media @xcite are the major obstacles for the realization of efficient all - optical quantum computation . to circumvent these difficulties ,",
    "it has been proposed to use linear optical elements , such as beam - splitters and phase - shifters , in conjunction with parametric dawn - converters and single - photon detectors , for achieving probabilistic quantum logic with photons conditioned on the successful outcome of a measurement performed on auxiliary photons @xcite . yet , an efficient and scalable device for quantum information processing with photons would ideally require deterministic sources of single photons , strong nonlinear photon - photon interaction and reliable single - photon detectors .",
    "in addition , a versatile optical quantum computer would need a robust reversible memory devise .    in this paper",
    "we discuss several related techniques which can be used to implement all of the above prerequisites for deterministic optical quantum computation .",
    "the schemes discussed below are based on the coherent manipulation of atomic ensembles in the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , which is a quantum interference effect that results in a dramatic reduction of the group velocity of weak propagating field accompanied by vanishing absorption @xcite . as the quantum interference is usually very sensitive to the system parameters ,",
    "various schemes exhibiting eit have recently received considerable attention due to their potential for greatly enhancing nonlinear optical effects .",
    "some of the most representative examples include slow - light enhancement of acusto - optical interactions in doped fibers @xcite , trapping light in optically dense atomic and doped solid - state media by coherently converting photonic excitation into spin excitation @xcite or by creating photonic band gap via periodic modulation of the eit resonance @xcite , and nonlinear photon - photon coupling using n - shaped configuration of atomic levels @xcite .",
    "below , we will focus on the optical implementation of quantum computation with qubit basis states represented by two orthogonal polarization states of single photons , as opposed to an alternative approach , wherein nearly - orthogonal weak coherent states of optical fields are used @xcite .",
    "the chief motivation for this is that single - photon pulses provide a natural choice for qubits employed in quantum computation and quantum communication protocols @xcite , and facilitate the convenience and intuitiveness in the description of their dynamics in quantum information processing networks .    in section  [ sec : oqc ]",
    "we outline the envisioned setup of an optical quantum computer and discuss the physical implementations of the required single- and two - qubit logic operations .",
    "section  [ sec : eit ] gives a concise introduction of the eit in optically dense atomic media , which is necessary for understanding the principles of operation of photonic memory devise of section  [ sec : mem ] , deterministic single photon sources discussed in section  [ sec : sphs ] , giant cross - phase modulation of section  [ sec : xpm ] , and reliable single - photon detection presented in section  [ sec : sphd ] .",

    "_ computation _ : the desired unitary transformation of the register .",
    "any multiqubit unitary transformation can be decomposed into a sequence of single - qubit rotations and two- ( or more ) qubit conditional operations , which thus constitute the universal set of quantum logic gates .",
    "_ output _ : projective measurement of the final state of the register in the computational basis .",
    "the reliable measurement scheme would need to have the fidelity more than @xmath4 , but ideally as close to 1 as possible .",

    "it should be mentioned that a related scheme for single photon generation employing the dipole blockade technique was proposed in @xcite . there , however , a single atom at a time was transferred to an excited state , from where it spontaneously decayed back to the ground state producing a single fluorescent photon in a well - defined direction .",
    "conventional media are typically characterized by weak optical nonlinearities , which are manifest only at high intensities of electromagnetic fields @xcite and are vanishingly small for single- or few - photon fields .",
    "it was first pointed out in @xcite , however , that the ultrahigh sensitivity of eit dispersion to the two - photon raman detuning @xmath242 in the vicinity of absorption minimum , can be used to achieve giant kerr nonlinearities between two weak optical fields interacting with four - level atoms in n - configuration of levels . as was shown in section  [ sec : eit ] , a probe field with @xmath243 propagating in the eit medium experiences negligible absorption and phase - shift .",
    "when , however , a second weak ( signal ) field , dispersively coupling state @xmath38 to another excited state @xmath244 , is introduced in the medium , it causes a stark shift of level @xmath38 , given by @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is the rabi frequency and @xmath247 is the detuning of the signal field from the @xmath248 resonance .",
    "thus the eit spectrum is effectively shifted by the amount of @xmath249 , which results in the conditional phase - shift of the probe field , @xmath250 . notwithstanding",

    "one either has to work with cold atoms , of choose large detuning @xmath252 , which limits the resulting cross - phase shift .",
    "another drawback of this scheme is the mismatch between the slow group velocity of the probe pulse subject to eit , and that of the nearly - free propagating signal pulse , which severely limits their effective interaction length and the maximal conditional phase - shift @xcite .",
    "this drawback may be remedied by using an equal mixture of two isotopic species , interacting with two driving fields and an appropriate magnetic field , which would render the group velocities of the two pulses equal @xcite .",
