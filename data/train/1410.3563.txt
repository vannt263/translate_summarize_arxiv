    "the current understanding of the cosmic large scale structure origin is included in the @xmath2cdm scenario ( planck collaboration 2013 ) . according to this cosmological model",
    "the self - gravitating systems at galactic scales have been formed following a hierarchical process of mass accretion and mergers , and galaxies grew up by the collapse of baryons into the bottom of dark matter haloes potential wells ( white & rees 1978 ; rees & ostriker 1977 ; silk & mamon 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore it is possible to find a relationship between dark matter haloes mass accretion / merging histories and the interactions between galaxies .",
    "the consistency between the halo mass function and the galaxy luminosity function predicts a relationship between the halo mass and the observed galaxy stellar mass , and it is at the core of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) techniques , widely used to test the consistency between galaxies population and @xmath2cdm cosmology .    on the other hand , stellar kinematic studies of nearby galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; richstone et al . 1998 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ) suggest that a supermassive black hole reside at their centres . currently , our milky way ( mw ) is the most striking example ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "there is also a variety of investigations confirming that the mass of the bh is highly correlated to the mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ; graham et al . 2011",
    "; mcconnell & ma 2013 ) .",
    "additionally , still controversial correlations between total luminosity or mass and bh mass ( ferrarese 2002 ; baldana 2009 ; lsker 2013 ) suggest that bh and their host galaxies evolve in a symbiotic way ( cattaneo 2009 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ) .",
    "a natural consequence is that from galaxy mergers , a large number of bh binaries must form along the cosmic history ( begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ; volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ) .",
    "however , few spatially resolved subkpc binaries are known so far ( rodriguez et al . 2006 ; fabbiano et al . 2011 ; woo et al .",
    "2014 ) , and the few observations of sub parsec candidates reported ( tsalmanza 2011 ; eracleous 2012 ; liu 2014 ) could also be explained by a number of scenarios other than the presence of a binary ( dotti 2012 ) .",
    "the search for and characterization of the corresponding binary bh population are of great importance to understand both galaxy formation and gravitational wave ( gw ) physics .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the binary system within the merged galaxy , and the interaction with the host both dynamically and possibly via feedback during baryonic accretion onto one or both bhs , encode crucial information about the assembly of the bulge and the central bh .",
    "if the binary eventually coalesces , it will produce a gravitational siren that could be detected with future low frequency gw experiments ( e.g. , colpi & dotti 2011 ) .",
    "detecting bh binaries is then crucial in understanding the coevolution of galaxies and bhs , and for testing fundamental physics .",
    "the bh binaries may produce a wide range of em signals in their path to coalesce : emission associated to a circumbinary disk ( cbd ) ( milosavljevi 2005 ; tanaka & menou 2010 ; tanaka 2012 ; sesana 2012 ; mckernan 2013 ; roedig 2014 ) , variability due to the orbital motion ( gower 1982 ; sillanpaa 1988 ; kaastra & roos 1992 ; britzen 2010 ; kudryavtseva 2011 ; godfrey 2012 ) , multiple accreting bhs spatially resolved ( komossa 2003 ; rodriguez 2006 ; fabbiano 2011 ; koss 2011 ; paggi 2013 ) , enhanced tidal disruption events ( ivanov 2005 ; chen 2009 ; wegg & nate bode 2011 ) and bhs wandering as a result of three - body interactions ( governato 1994 ; iwasawa 2006 ) or post - merger recoiling bhs ( komossa & merritt 20008 ; merritt 2009 ; oleary & loeb 2009 ) .",
    "the frequency window of gw from bh binaries corresponds to the low frequencies in the range ( @xmath3)hz covered by two projects : elisa and ptas .",
    "the _ evolved laser interferometer space antenna _",
    "( elisa ) will be the first dedicated space based gravitational wave detector .",
    "it will measure gravitational waves at low frequencies , from about @xmath4 mhz to @xmath5 hz ( amaro - seoane 2013 ) .",
    "the potential _ elisa _ sources include bh close binaries in the process of coalescence , with total mass in the range @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the primary and secondary bh masses respectively ) .",
    "the technique to detect gw of ultra - low frequencies ( @xmath9 to @xmath10 hz ) is called pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) , consisting of sets of millisecond pulsar whose joint pulse arrival time produce correlations that have encoded information of gravitational waves passing the earth and/or the pulsar ( foster & backer , 1990 ) .",
    "ptas will detect gw from the coalescence of bh binaries with masses @xmath11 and mass ratio @xmath12 ( sesana 2012 ) .    before we reach the direct gw detection era ,",
    "the possibility of detecting em counterparts revealing binary coalescence events unambiguously has valuable potential , either constraining the dynamics of the coalescence process ( e.g. , sesana 2007 ; trias & sintes 2008 ; amaro - seoane et al .",
    "2012 ) , or the origin and evolution of bhs ( e.g. , volonteri 2010 , kulkarni & loeb 2012 ) , and the environments where these events take place . even though the richness offered by the em signatures produced in binaries the aim is to reach the multimessenger astrophysics era of trans - spectral studies ( gw+em ) to narrow the degeneracies of a possible gw detection ( e.g. , bloom 2009 ) .",
    "recent studies have aimed to narrow this multimessenger search , sesana ( 2012 ) used a semi - analytical galaxy formation model and a massive bh halo population algorithm in order to predict the frequency of different em signals related with pta sources .",
    "later rosado & sesana ( 2013 ) study the environment of bh binaries suitable to be detected by ptas , finding a bias to high density environments .",
    "lastly simon ( 2014 ) assuming that each galaxy has a binary bh of equal mass , evaluated probable locations of pta sources , suggesting nearby clusters .    in this work",
    "we intend to relax some of the assumptions adopted in previous studies , we build a more realistic binary population and we do not assume that all binaries in the local universe are in the same coalescence stage , however we do not try to model the detectability . by focusing the modelling of binaries since the last major merger ( lmm ) of their host galaxies and following their dynamical evolution , we expect to understand better those objects that are more likely to be reliably considered galaxy candidates to host binaries . in order to do so , we populate under different strategies the dark matter haloes in a cosmological simulation during the last major merger event and track down the binary evolution , including the interaction with stars and a gaseous circumbinary disk .",
    "we use halo occupation distribution ( hod ) techniques and semiempirical halo / galaxies scaling relationships ( firmani & vila - reese 2010 ) in order to assign a bh and galaxy properties to each halo , satisfying scale relationships such as luminosity function , in order to asses the binary bh galaxy host different properties with more accuracy .",
    "the assignment was performed at different epochs in order to track down binary galaxy host properties at different redshifts .",
    "we estimate the lifespan and variability of electromagnetic signals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the parameters and analysis adopted for our cosmological simulation . in section 3 we describe the prescriptions implemented in order to populate dark matter haloes with stellar disks and bhs . in section 4 we describe the semi - analytical model implemented to follow the dynamical evolution of bh pairs from cosmological scales down to subparsec scales . in section 5",
    "we discuss the properties found for galaxies hosting binaries with separations @xmath13pc , candidates to decay due to gw emission .",
    "in section 6 we classify binaries in the previous section into pta and sb sources , then we present the bimodality found in host galaxy properties , as total mass , stellar mass , and environment . in section 7",
    "we present the assumptions made in order to assign a possible em signature , then we discuss the abundance and characteristics of the em features that might be found in the binary populations resulting from our models . finally , we summarize the main conclusions of this paper in section 8 .",
    "in this work we use a cosmological n - body dark matter simulation which is part of the constrained local universe simulations ( clues ) project , whose aim is to perform cosmological simulations that reproduce the main features that characterize the local large scale structure in the universe ( gottleber 2010 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mapatot ] shows the distribution in the clues simulation of haloes more massive than @xmath14 , shown as blue dots .",
    "it also shows the projected positions of the halo identified with the virgo cluster and the halo dubbed as _ mw candidate _ as black circle and black square , respectively .",
    "the hoffman & ribak ( 1991 ) algorithm was used to generate the initial conditions as constrained realizations of gaussian random fields .",
    "constrained simulations represent a powerful tool to understand the history of the best known part of the universe . by using them it",
    "is possible to construct a constrained sample of possible merging galaxies corresponding to any epoch of the local universe .",
    "also , constrained simulations allow us to explore the assembly history of mw and m31-like galaxies ( forero - romero 2011 ) , considered as candidates for such systems due not only to theirs masses ( as usually assumed in other dark matter simulations ) but also because their environments and mahs have been shaped along the cosmic history by the large scale structure in which the local universe actually dwells .",
    "advantages we will use to explore the origin and evolution of the bhs in galaxies in the local group in an upcoming paper . we summarize the simulation main properties here for clarity .",
    "the simulation has @xmath15 particles with mass @xmath16 in a box with side length of @xmath17mpc .",
    "it was run using the pmtree - sph mpi code ` gadget`2 ( springel 2005 ) .",
    "the simulation has standard @xmath2cdm initial conditions , assuming a wmap3 cosmology ( spergel et .",
    "al . 2007 ) , i.e. @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , a normalization of @xmath21 and a spectral index of primordial density perturbations @xmath22 .",
    "as a frame , our model uses mass aggregation histories ( mahs ) from the simulation to identify the last major merger redshift ( zlmm ) and to estimate the _ cosmic mass accretion rate _ which corresponds to the mass accreted going to the very centre of the galaxy . the impact of cosmic variance on the clues simulation s halo population has been studied before ( forero - romero et .",
    "al . 2011 ) .",
    "they conclude that constrained simulation mahs are essentially unbiased when compared to unconstrained simulations with higher resolution within larger volumes .",
    "to identify haloes we use a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with linking length of @xmath23 times the mean inter - particle separation .",
    "we have identified the haloes for 133 snapshots more or less equally spaced over the 13.4 gyrs between redshifts @xmath24 .",
    "all objects with 20 or more particles are kept in the halo catalogue and considered in the merger tree construction .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum halo mass of @xmath25 . within this simulation a milky way dark matter halo of mass @xmath26 is resolved with @xmath27 particles .",
    "the mahs do not include any information of the substructure in each halo .",
    "mahs are constructed by comparing the particles in fof groups in two consecutive snapshots .",
    "starting at @xmath28 for every halo @xmath29 in the catalogue , we find all the fof groups in the previous snapshots that share at least 13 particles with the halo @xmath29 at @xmath28 , and label them as potential progenitors .",
    "then , for each tentative progenitor , we find all the descendants sharing at least 13 particles . since the smallest group has 20 particles , at least @xmath30 of the particles must be identified in provisional progenitors or descendants . only the tentative progenitors whose main descendant is @xmath29 , are labelled as confirmed progenitors at that snapshot .",
    "we iterate this procedure for each confirmed progenitor , until reaching the last available snapshot at high redshift . by construction ,",
    "each halo in the mah can have only one descendant , but many progenitors .",
    "the time at which haloes mergers occur corresponds to the moment when their radii overlap for the first time .",
    "major mergers ( mm ) are defined in terms of an increase of at least @xmath31 in the total mass of a descendant halo . the lmm time is identified in the mahs for each halo with mass @xmath32 ( at @xmath28 ) .",
    "we verify the reliability of the merger event inspecting the neighbour snapshots .",
    "the zlmm provides a starting point for our model , and we consider it the first stage in the coalescence process .",
    "our n - body simulation includes only dark matter , if we intend to constraint the properties of binary bh host galaxies we require a strategy to populate dark matter halos with galaxies , below we describe our galaxies / black holes assignment scheme .",
    "the galaxy / dark halo connection has received an important deal of attention in recent years .",
    "such connection have been commonly studied using _ ab initio _ strategies : n - body simulations coupled with semi - analytic galaxy formation models or self consistent cosmological hydrodynamic plus n - body simulations .",
    "an alternative strategy with an empirical spirit is to assume a direct match between dark halos and observed galaxy properties , in particular stellar mass .",
    "although this approach does not determine the physical processes behind the correspondence , it can be extended even to trace the galaxies halo / stellar mass evolution assuring a consistency with a set of observations .",
    "we use the latter option , a semi - empirical approach to define a galaxy population consistent with current observations , including : luminosity function and downsizing ( firmani & vila - reese 2010 ) .",
    "the implementation assumes that we can transform the dark halo mahs into average stellar mass growth histories , @xmath33 , following the semi - empirical relation given by firmani & vila - reese ( 2010 ) , @xmath34 where the dependence on @xmath35 is introduce in the parameters of equation [ vladi ] as @xmath36 whose values were chosen according to table [ vladt ] .",

    "characterizing the types of galaxies likely to host bh binaries can be useful to determine a low frequency gw source location , to search for peculiar em signatures , and to elucidate whether such a peculiar em signature is truly due to a coalescing binary as predicted by various scenarios .",
    "furthermore , if we are able to identify the host galaxy , and therefore the gw source position ; luminosity distance measurements based on gws would be greatly improved ( arun 2009 ) .",
    "it also reduces the parameter space of search templates , and correspondingly increases the observed signal - to - noise ratio . identifying and studying plausible binary bhs host galaxies by their properties and em signatures is possible now and will teach us about mergers rate , galaxy assembly histories , accretion and even might help us narrow uncertainties about the possibility of detecting individual gw sources . here",

    "we conclude that the redshift distribution is slightly asymmetric with high significance , and half of the systems distributed below z@xmath430.21 . ]    regardless of both the model parameters and the bh seeding prescription , the binary bhs redshift distributions , shown in figure [ fig : boxz ] , peak around @xmath44 with a @xmath42 confidence interval .",
    "the distributions reveal an asymmetric shape with @xmath45 of the binaries highly concentrated between @xmath46 z @xmath47 and a tail towards low redshift including the remaining @xmath41 .",
    "we note that @xmath48 is the most important parameter determining the redshift distribution .",

    "it is evident from the figure that @xmath48 is the parameter driving the host galaxy halo mass normalization and shape .",
    "however the bh seeding seems to reflect on the high mass tail . ]",
    "determining the distribution of dark matter halo masses hosting binary bhs in the gw regime is a first step towards constraining its origin and abundance .",
    "when comparing the host galaxy halo mass distribution for all models , we see from figure [ fig : boxmhall ] that even though there is no agreement on the mass at which the distributions peak across parameter sets , most bh binaries are systematically found in host galaxies with total mass larger than the milky way halo mass . models with more massive cbd ( 1 - 4 in table [ parametros ] , with either o and f bh seeding prescription ) result in more numerous binary populations , as indicated by the boxes width ( figure [ fig : boxmhall ] ) and the histogram normalization in figure [ fig : mh ] .",
    "it is clear from figures [ fig : boxmhall ] and [ fig : mh ] that systems with less massive initial cbd , @xmath59 , tend to peak at lower halo mass , @xmath60 for f seeding prescription , while for o seeding prescription the more typical host galaxy halo mass for less massive cbd is @xmath61 . unfortunately , total mass estimation is a challenging quantity to measure with current observations , useful constraints have been set using stacked galaxies plus satellites systems ( yang et al .",
    "2012 ) or weak lensing ( mandenbaum et al . 2006 ) but until the next generation of surveys , like lsst , the statistical significance will be limited .",
    "we can see , also from figure [ fig : mh ] , that @xmath48 is the the driving parameter .",
    "if @xmath62 is smaller the number of bh binaries will be smaller , in particular for those hosted in galaxies with higher total mass , given the fact their lmm happen at low redshifts ( fakhouri & ma 2009 ) and the binaries are embedded in less massive cbd , they have less time available to reach the gw emission regime in a non - favourable angular momentum exchange with the cbd . the high mass tail shows a mild but interesting dependence with the bh seeding scheme , that can be tracked down to the fact that the random nature of the bh seeding prescription o , may populate high - mass halos with more massive bhs than the deterministic f seeding scheme .",

    "thus , it is important and useful to investigate the potential host galaxies stellar mass distribution . using the halo mass of the host galaxy , we assign stellar mass following firmani & vila - reese ( 2011 ) semi - empirical modelling",
    ", whose @xmath65 ratio function has a bell shape around @xmath63 .",
    "a consequence of the dependence on the @xmath65 ratio is that the shape of the stellar mass distribution is skewed towards low masses . in figures [ fig : boxms ] and [ fig : ms ] we can see that bh binaries host galaxies have stellar masses distributions with a broad peak in the range @xmath66 and a tail in the low mass end going up to @xmath67 .",
    "most gw candidates ( @xmath51 ) are hosted in galaxies more massive than @xmath68 ( baldry 2008 ) , regardless the model parameters .",
    "however for model f10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boxms ] ) the effect of a low mass cbd is more dramatic , binaries in massive host galaxies get stuck at large separations , not close enough to enter the gw emission regime .",
    "thus , for this model , the galaxy population hosting gw candidates is less massive in average with mean stellar mass equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the scatter in the bh seeding prescription o , may assign more massive bhs , and as a consequence more massive cbds , to the same galaxies than the f prescription , pushing some host galaxies towards the gw regime .",

    "if the binary hardening happens in a gas rich environment , as we are assuming , circumbinary and individual accretion disks around the bhs may form .",
    "whilst on the fourth stage of the model , we explore the possible electromagnetic ( em ) signatures associated to the cbd and accretion disks .",
    "following sesana ( 2012 ) , by calculating the angular momentum at the inner cbd radius and the size of the possible accretion disks at each time step for all binaries in our sample we can identify the possible em emission scenarios .",
    "the change in angular momentum at the cbds inner radius is given by hayasaki ( 2009 ) : @xmath104 we numerically integrate at every time step in order to get the radii for the keplerian orbit @xmath105 at which the infalling material is captured around each bh given by the angular momentum of the material in the inner orbit of the cbd . following sesana ( 2012 ) and rees ( 1988 ) if @xmath106 , ( with @xmath107 the schwarzschild radius ) the inflow is radial and there will be bondi - like accretion . for larger values , the infalling material settles at radius @xmath108 around @xmath109 and dissipates its angular momentum through viscous processes , eventually being accreted by the bhs .",
    "the time needed for an annulus of material at radius @xmath93 to be accreted for an @xmath110 disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the viscosity parameter , the radiative efficiency @xmath113 , for all binaries , @xmath114 is the accretion disk size in @xmath115 units of the @xmath116-bh .",
    "if @xmath117 is longer than the binary orbital period @xmath118 , then a lasting , periodically fed accretion disk will form around the bh .",
    "if @xmath117 is shorter than @xmath118 , then accretion is periodic without lasting accretion disks , which by itself has the distinctive signature of variable accretion associated with the binary period .",
    "the radius at which the transition between this two possibilities happens is found by equating both , the period @xmath118 and the accretion time @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath119 where @xmath118 is the binary period in years , @xmath120 is the accretion mass rate as defined by equation [ mpunto ] and @xmath121 is the mass of the @xmath116-bh in units of @xmath122 .    it is possible to identify 3 scenarios for em signatures for binaries that are still coupled to the cbd and a spectral feature in binaries that have decoupled .",
    "we explore the abundance of the following em signatures in our complete binary population and its dependence on the bh seeding prescription .    1 .",
    "if @xmath123 or equivalently @xmath124 , there will be steady optical / ir emission from the cbd .",
    "material falling from the cbd inner radius will form an accretion disk around the bh , whose accretion time will be short compared to the orbital period , thus presenting strong periodicity in the uv / soft x - ray .",
    "2 .   if @xmath125 or @xmath126 there will be steady uv / soft x - ray emission due to the long lived accretion disk around the bh , which is likely to produce a relativistic fe @xmath127 line .",
    "thus , in case this condition is met by the two bhs , the two fe @xmath127 superposed lines might be observable , in addition to the optical / ir emission from the cbd .",
    "if @xmath128 , there is radial accretion .",
    "no signatures of an accreting system are present , only the optical / ir emission from the cbd .",
    "4 .   if @xmath129 yr and the binary is decoupled from the cbd , the combined spectrum from the cbd plus accretion disk might show a deficient soft x - ray continuum and uv emission compared with a single bh of mass @xmath130 . such deficient emission being more evident for shorter periods .",
    "although the aforementioned features have been proposed by sesana ( i , ii , iii ; 2012 ) and tanaka ( iv , 2012 ) for pta sources , we have extended their application to less massive binaries . we keep track of the time during which the conditions for one of the em signatures proposed are met and consider this the lifespan of the associated signature . as",
    "the binary s angular momentum and separation decreases due to the interaction within gaseous disks , the gw driven coalescence takes over , such mechanism is not included in the model current version .",
    "therefore , the electromagnetic signature lifespan found here might be considered as an upper limit , since the orbital decay is much quicker once the gw emission drives the angular momentum loss ( peters , 1964 ; heiman 2012 ) .",
    "almost all sb sources have a 3-disk configuration whilst on the last stage , i.e. em signature type ii : a cbd and two long lived accretion disks around each bh with viscous time scale longer than the period , resulting in a em signature given by an optical / ir continuum from the cbd and double x - ray fe @xmath131 emission lines from the accretion disks .",
    "while accretion variability might not be associated with the period , shocks between the infalling material and the accretion disks may produce x - ray hot spots varying on the orbital period , most sb sources have periods of @xmath132 yr .    in figure",
    "[ fig : period ] we see that sb sources in haloes populated with f seeding prescription ( empirical with increasing power law behaviour ) do not show binaries with @xmath133 yr . for binaries with o seeding prescription",
    "there are a few binaries with period equal or shorter than a year , the more massive ones allowed by the broader dispersion in the seeding prescription .",
    "thus , less than @xmath134 binaries with different parameter values ( o seeding prescription only ) might show the em signature type iv , abnormally weak soft x - ray continuum and uv emission as proposed by tanaka ( 2012 ) .",
    "we found that the lifespan of the em signature due to a 3-disk configuration ranges between @xmath135 years ( figure [ fig : lifespan ] ) compatible with the theorized agn duty - cycle .",
    "for less massive cbds ( models 5,6,7,8 & 10 ) , the angular momentum loss decreases , producing less pairs reaching the gw regime .",
    "those that are able to reach such regime will spend more time interacting with the cbd resulting in a longer lifespan for the em signature .    as in the case of sb sources , most pta sources ,",
    "regardless the model , show the dynamical conditions to have a 3-disk configuration with a em signature type ii , with some differences .",
    "models f10 and o10 ( our models with the less massive cbd ) are dominated by signature type i , same configuration suggested by roedig ( 2011 ) simulations , which consists of two accretion disks with viscous time scale shorter than the period whose signature might be observed as accretion associated variability in the uv / soft x - ray .    for models @xmath136 ( for both seeding prescriptions , o and f ) @xmath137 of the binaries do not fulfill the conditions to form accretion disks , so a small fraction of binaries would not be detected as an accreting system .    according with our model , pta sources have periods within the range @xmath138 yr , figure [ fig : period ] , with a tail going up to a few days for some models . indicating that those binaries with a long lived accretion disks might show variability associated to shocks caused by streaming material into the accretion disk coming from the cbd or if the typical cbd in nature turn out to be light ( as in the case of models o10 and f10 ) there might be an accretion associated emission with variability of a few years .    ]     as a function of the time spent within a cbd .",
    "this time scale might be considered an upper limit of the em signature lifespan . ]",
    "we have developed a dynamical model for the decay of supermassive black hole binaries .",
    "it has been applied to create a population of binaries likely to decay due to gw emission within a cosmological volume similar to the local universe .",
    "our model is coupled with a cosmological simulation , we retrieved the redshift of the last major merger for all haloes with masses @xmath32 ( at @xmath28 ) , this zlmm constitutes the starting point for the binary evolution .",
    "we used semi - empirical approaches to assign galaxies and bhs to the haloes . in the final stage ,",
    "the interaction within a gaseous disk is responsible for the binaries coalescence .",
    "the binary s destiny is set by a competition between cosmic accretion that replenish gas and angular momentum into the cbd and the binary , versus the angular momentum drain out of the binary by the cbd torques",
    ".    for the binaries found we used a simple criteria based on bhs mass and separation to create a population of binaries prone to emit gw in the pta frequency window and in that of the space - based detectors .",
    "we found a bimodal correlation between host galaxy properties , environment , and binary period . such correlation defines the properties that the host galaxy populations of pta or sb sources might show .",
    "we anticipate that individual cases are rather difficult to distinguish between binaries and anomalous agns , but at a demographic level it might be possible to identify a subset of agns powered by binaries in the subpc regime .",
    "we investigate the bh binaries host galaxies properties , environment characterization and likelihood to observe some of the em signatures previously proposed .",
    "a short summary of our results follows here :    * in our model for the binaries in the gaseous disk stage the most dominant parameter is the @xmath139 ratio .",
    "the cbd mass works as a regulator of the angular momentum exchange mechanism for the whole binary populations across models , overpowering even the cosmic accretion rate . * the expected number density of binaries ( sb and pta sources combined ) in the local universe is @xmath140 . with a probability of finding a binary every 1000 galaxies with stellar masses larger or equal to @xmath141 in our best case scenario .",

    "they are located on average in overdensity regions of @xmath100 , about 10 times the average density of the universe .",

    "the correlations found may serve as a strategy to distinguish binary local effects in agns using a combination of host galaxy properties and em signals .",
