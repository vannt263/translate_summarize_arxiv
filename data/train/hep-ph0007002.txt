    "detailed inspection @xcite reveals that it originates from the wave - function renormalization constant in the on - shell scheme , @xmath36 which also appears in the definition of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gos ] ) .",
    "one way to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : zos ] ) is to consider the taylor expansion of the inverse propagator @xmath37 about @xmath38 .",

    "another case where the non - analyticity of @xmath13 in the neighbourhood of @xmath38 leads to serious problems in the on - shell formalism is the behaviour of the resonant amplitude when the unstable particle is coupled to massless quanta , such as photons and gluons @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how the threshold singularities are rigorously removed by adopting the pole scheme .",
    "the salient point is that @xmath8 is redefined in such a way that the derivative term @xmath43 is replaced by an appropriate ratio of differences , where the increment of the argument is of order mass times width . in this way",
    ", the threshold singularities are regularized by the very width of the primary particle .",
    "this mechanism was illustrated for a toy model , consisting of a real scalar particle coupled to two stable , complex scalar particles , through a numerical simulation in ref .",

    ", we analytically elaborate the underlying formalism in a general , model - independent way and apply it to a case of phenomenological interest , namely the thresholds of the sm higgs boson at @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .",
    "if the threshold particles are unstable , an alternative way of eliminating the threshold singularities in a physically meaningful way is to incorporate their widths in the one - loop calculation @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : gpo ] ) about @xmath46 @xcite . furthermore , as will become apparent later on , threshold singularities only appear in connection with physical thresholds .",
    "therefore , this regularization procedure does not spoil the gauge independence of the physical predictions .",
    "if the widths of the threshold particles are much larger than the one of the primary particle , then it appears plausible to adopt this method . in general , however , the two regularizing effects , associated with the widths of the primary and threshold particles , should be combined in a unified analysis .",

    "<S> at one loop in the conventional on - mass - shell renormalization scheme , the production and decay rates of the higgs boson @xmath0 exhibit singularities proportional to @xmath1 as the higgs - boson mass @xmath2 approaches from below the pair - production threshold of a vector boson @xmath3 with mass @xmath4 . </S>",
