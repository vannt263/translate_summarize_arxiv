    "* ) , driven primarily by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "but while these imaging campaigns are able to identify and resolve background sources like never before , imaging alone does not provide high - precision ( @xmath2 ) redshift information , a crucial component in interpreting models and deriving their physical values . while some spectroscopic campaigns are underway ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , acquiring spectra of lensed systems has , to date , largely been a long , costly , and inefficient process . with the advent of integral field unit ( ifu )",
    "spectroscopy , however , this situation is rapidly changing . leading the way in these efforts is the multi - unit spectroscopic explorer ( muse ; @xcite ) a wide - field ifu on the very large telescope ( vlt ) in chile . with a large @xmath3 arcmin@xmath4 field of view and high sensitivity between 4800 and 9300  ,",

    "we present new muse data of the strong lensing cluster abell 370 ( a370 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a370 is a massive cluster ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) at redshift @xmath9 @xcite with historical significance to lensing : it contains one of the first known `` giant luminous arc '' features @xcite , which later became the first spectroscopically - confirmed giant - arc lens system @xcite . thanks to this discovery , and",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , after an initial period of activity , interest in a370 slowly waned ; there was little spectroscopic follow - up on the cluster , and it was not selected to be a part of massive cluster surveys such as macs @xcite or clash @xcite , in spite of its high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 ; @xcite ) .    in 2010 , a newly - refurbished hst observed a370 to test its deep - imaging capabilities , generating renewed interest .",
    "this led to a new lens model @xcite , additional weak - lensing analyses @xcite , and its eventual selection as one of the hubble frontier fields ( hff ) clusters @xcite .",
    "several groups have since modeled the cluster ( see the hff archive and also @xcite and @xcite ) , but ( until recently ) only three lensed systems have had a secure redshift , all with @xmath12 ( see section [ oldsys ] for details . ) as a result , these models are only able to probe the critical line region of the cluster out to small radii . while recent work by @xcite has increased the number of secure - redshift systems to five , the highest of these is still @xmath13 . here ,",
    "we extend the redshift range of spectroscopically - confirmed systems even further and present newly - discovered systems as well . by combining the muse spectroscopy with the current hff data",
    ", we can therefore improve on existing lens models , probing the mass distribution out to larger scales and with much higher precision . in this way",
    ", we can improve our view of this massive cluster in conjunction with the final hff data release .",
    "overall , this work is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the muse and hff data and the data reduction processes we used . in section 3 , we describe how we extract muse redshifts and present the a370 redshift catalog , paying particular attention to redshifts of the multiply - imaged galaxies . using these redshifts , we construct a new mass model , which we present in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the results of the mass modeling and make predictions for future work in section 5 .",
    "finally , we briefly conclude in section 6 . throughout this paper , we assume a standard cosmological model with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 = 70 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 . using this model",
    ", one arcsecond covers a physical distance of 5.162 kpc at the a370 redshift ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "all magnitudes are measured using the ab system .",
    "lensing is a three - dimensional effect , sensitive to both the transverse and line - of - sight distances between objects .",
    "therefore , we need a combination of imaging data ( to identify lensed objects and measure their apparent positions ) and redshift data ( to measure radial distances ) to construct an accurate lens model of a370 .      hst imaging data of a370 were taken as part of the hubble frontier fields ( hff ) program , and are publicly available on the hff website . while the imaging campaign for a370 is now complete , the epoch 1 ( v1.0 ) mosaics that we use in this work consist of deep advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) data in three optical bands , f435w , f606w , and f814w ( i d : 13504 , pi : j.  lotz ) .",
    "these are supplemented by shallower f814w imaging from archival programs : ( i d : 11507 , pi : k. noll ) and ( i d : 11591 , pi j .- p .",
    "kneib ) . additionally , shallow , archival , wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ; @xcite ) data is available in three bands : f105w ( i d : 13459 , pi : t. treu ) , f140w ( i d : 11108 , pi : e. hu ; i d : 13459 , pi : t. treu ) , and f160w ( i d : 11591 , pi : j .- p .",
    "kneib ; i d : 14216 , pi : r.  kirshner ) , and a shallow , pilot hff exposure , also in the f140w band .",
    "individual exposures are reduced and stacked by the hff team directly , using the standard pyraf / stsdas pipeline .",
    "additionally , the acs mosaics are further corrected with a `` self - calibration '' technique to eliminate charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) effects and low - level pixel noise ( j. anderson , in prep ) .",
    "the full reduction procedure is described in the a370 hff data archive[multiblock footnote omitted ] .    after combining all exposures ,",
    "total integration times are 51400 , 25316 , 130643 , 2335 , 12894 , and 9647 seconds for the f435w , f606w , f814w , f105w , f140w , and f160w bands , respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to 20 , 10 , 52 , 1 , 5 , and 4 hst orbits .",
    "collectively , this represents one of the deepest , highest resolution imaging of a370 ever taken , and corresponds to average limiting magnitudes of 29.3 in the optical bands and 27.6 in the near - ir bands .",
    "a color image of the cluster field consisting of the f435w , f606w , and f814w mosaics is shown in figure [ fig : hst ] .",
    "muse observations of a370 were taken on ut 2014 november 20 , as part of the guaranteed time observing ( gto ) program 094.a-0115(a ) ( pi : richard ) . in total , we observed four 30-minute exposures in wfm - noao - n mode , centered at ( @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 ) .",
    "we applied a small ( @xmath25 0.5 ) dither pattern between exposures to average out systematics on the detector , and we alternated taking exposures between pa = 0  and pa = 8  to reduce the systematic striping pattern caused by the ifu image slicers .",
    "the full observational footprint can be seen in figure [ fig : hst ] .",
    "typical seeing during the observations was 0.75 , as measured by stars in the field .",
    "the raw data were reduced through the muse pipeline @xcite provided by eso ( version 1.2 ) .",
    "this pipeline performs all basic reduction techniques : bias and flat - field correction ( using a combination of internal flats and illumination and twilight exposures ) , wavelength and geometric calibration , sky subtraction , flux calibration , and telluric correction .",
    "the a370 data were flux - calibrated using a combination of several standard stars observed under photometric conditions . after basic corrections we align individual exposures to a common wcs with ` scamp ` @xcite , shifting each frame relative to a reference image , which in this case is the f814w hff data .",
    "we then transform the re - aligned images into data cubes , resampling all pixels onto a common 3-dimensional grid with two spatial and one spectral axis . the final spectral resolution of the cubes varies from r=2000 to r=4000 , with a spectral range between 4750 and 9350  .",
    "to ensure that cubes are properly nyquist - sampled , we set the wavelength grid to 1.25 pixel@xmath11 .",
    "the final spatial resolution is 0.2pixel@xmath11 in order to properly sample the psf .",
    "next , we process each cube with the zurich atmosphere purge ( ` zap ` ; @xcite ) , a software package that uses a principal component analysis technique to remove known systematics from the sky model , further improving sky - subtraction residuals . to account for changes in sky transmittance from exposure to exposure , we compare the fluxes of stars common to each cube .",
    "the cube with the brightest flux values is taken as a new photometric standard , and we scale the zeropoints of the other cubes until the fluxes agree across all exposures .",
    "we then merge all cubes together to create a combined master cube . during the merging process",
    ", we apply a 3-@xmath26 clipping routine to reject outliers , eliminating cosmic - ray strikes and hot pixels on the detector . as a final step ,",
    "we re - run the ` zap ` process on the master cube in order to eliminate low - level sky residuals that can only be seen in the improved signal - to - noise ratio of the combined data .",
    "after reducing the data , we probe the muse cube for redshifts using two complementary techniques : 1 . ) an automated emission line detection program , and 2 . ) a customized , interactive data visualization tool designed to extract muse aperture spectra by hand .    the automated program , muselet , is included as part of the muse python data analysis framework ( mpdaf ) version 2.0 .",
    "it first creates narrow - band images of the data , averaging the flux over a narrow emission wavelength range and then subtracting a local continuum . for the a370 cube ,",
    "we choose an emission window of 6.25   ( spanning five muse wavelength slices ) , with each window centered on one of the original wavelength planes .",
    "the continuum is created by averaging two 25   slices , immediately blue- and red - ward of the emission window . after creating the narrow - band images",
    ", muselet uses source extractor @xcite to identify emission features in each image , then merges these features together into a final master catalog .",
    "emission features at different wavelengths are considered to belong to the same source if they fall within 0.8  of each other ( i.e. , within the seeing fwhm ) in the case of continuum - free detections , or if they fall within half of the effective radius ( @xmath27/2 ) of a continuum - emission object . for every source that has multiple emission lines identified , muselet fits a redshift using a template of known spectral lines . to ensure the accuracy of the muselet fit",
    ", we manually inspect the line features of each identified redshift before adding it to the final catalog .    in cases where an obvious galaxy appears in the hst image or muse cube but is undetected ( absorption galaxies ) or unclassified ( single emission - line galaxies ) by muselet",
    ", we instead use the interactive tool .",
    "the tool , a custom - made python script , collapses the data cube along the wavelength axis , creating a `` white - light '' image of the field .",
    "a second panel , matched to the wcs of the cube , shows a corresponding hst image to help identify the target galaxy .",
    "once a galaxy has been identified , a user can draw a ( circular or rectangular ) aperture around the target object , which will extract both a 2d and 1d spectrum from the cube . from these spectra , the user",
    "can then interactively fit a redshift to the galaxy , using the same set of lines as the automatic line - finder .",
    "an example of this process can be seen in figure [ fig : midas ] .",
    "as an additional check , we run ` autoz ` @xcite on the extracted 1d spectrum . in all cases , we find the difference between the manual and ` autoz ` fits to be less than @xmath28     emitter at redshift @xmath29 .",
    "the lyman-@xmath7 emission is clearly detected in the spectrum and is double - peaked . ]    after running both methods on the a370 cube , we combine all of the redshift results into a final catalog .",
    "overall , we securely identify 120 redshifts , consisting of multiply - imaged systems , cluster members , foreground interlopers , background sources , and stars .",
    "the spatial and spectral distributions of these redshifts are shown in figure [ fig : zdist ] .",
    "multiply - imaged background sources are particularly important in this work , since they provide strong constraints on the lensing mass model ( see section [ model ] ) . using a combination of hff imaging and muse spectroscopy , we are able to identify and confirm the redshifts of previously known multi - image systems and identify new systems as well .      prior to the release of the newest hff and muse data , 13 multi - image objects were identified in the a370 field @xcite including three with known redshifts : systems 1 @xcite , 2 @xcite , and 6 @xcite . a tentative guess for system 4 ( @xmath30 ) using vlt / fors2 grism spectroscopy",
    "was also presented in @xcite . of these systems , seven have at least one image that falls within the muse a370 footprint : systems 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 9 . using the muse data , we are able to confirm the previous redshifts of systems 1 ( @xmath31 ) , 2 ( @xmath32 ) , and 6 ( @xmath33 ) , refine and secure the redshift for system 4 ( @xmath34 ) , and provide new redshifts for systems 5 ( @xmath35 ) and 7 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we note that these new redshifts are within 2-@xmath26 of the values predicted in the @xcite lens model ( system 4 : @xmath37 ; system 5 : @xmath38 ; system 7 : @xmath39 ) , a reasonably good agreement .",
    "we are unable to identify any strong features in system 9 because it is too faint for a secure measurement .",
    "however , @xcite identify [ oii ] and [ oiii ] features for the system in hst grism spectroscopy , placing it at @xmath40 we note that this redshift is consistent with a non - detection in muse , since it falls in the `` redshift desert '' where no strong emission features appear in the muse wavelength range .",
    "additionally , @xcite also identify faint [ oiii ] emission for system 3 at @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt these redshift values in this work , also .",
    "in addition to the known objects , we also identify nine new multiply - imaged systems in the muse field ( systems 14  22 ) .",
    "@xcite independently identify four of these systems : 14 , 20 , 21 , and 22 ( labeled systems 10 , 29 , 26 , and 18 , respectively , in their work ) though without spectroscopic redshifts . with the exception of system 21 ( identified by [ oii ] ) ,",
    "these new systems are all strong lyman-@xmath7 emitters , located at considerably higher redshifts ( @xmath42 ) than those previously identified .",
    "systems 14 and 22 are particularly interesting , as they are reasonably close together and have an identical redshift ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this suggests that they could be an interacting pair of galaxies , and indeed , narrow - band imaging shows that the emission - line regions of the two are clearly overlapping ( figure [ fig:14 + 22 ] . )",
    "careful observation of the hff data reveals at least some flux associated with each of the new systems in broadband imaging , but in some cases  especially systems 15 and 16  this flux is extremely faint and contaminated by brighter objects nearby .",
    "spectra of all systems in the muse field of view are shown in figure [ fig : redshifts ] .",
    "the full list of multiply - imaged systems , including all identified and/or model - predicted counterimages of a given system , is presented in table [ tbl : multi - images ] .    -emitting galaxies .",
    "while hst imaging alone shows that the two galaxies are in close proximity to one another and have similar colors , new spectroscopy from muse reveals that they have exactly the same redshift ( @xmath29 . ) additionally , narrow - band imaging of the emission line ( green contours ) shows that there is a significant overlap between the galaxies lyman-@xmath7 halos , suggesting that the two galaxies could be interacting . ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 are measured relative to the reference coordinate point : ( @xmath7 = 39.97134 , @xmath46 = -1.5822597 )   + @xmath47 ellipticity ( @xmath48 ) is defined to be @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the ellipse   + @xmath52 quantities in brackets are fixed parameters      @xmath53 kpc@xmath54 , starting from @xmath55 @xmath53 kpc@xmath54 .",
    "highlighted in red are the centroids of the four cluster - scale dark matter halos .",
    "red ellipses are used to give a rough estimate of the relative shape and strength of each component , but we stress that the actual mass contours are much larger and flatter . ]",
    "while adding two new large - scale mass clumps to the model significantly improves the fit , it is important to ask the question `` is this additional mass truly necessary ? '' in other words , are these new mass clumps real features supported by the data , or is it simply a case of overfitting in a sparsely sampled region of the cluster ?",
    "to answer this , we look at both model and ( perhaps more importantly ) physical evidence .    from a purely statistical point of view",
    ", the bayesian evidence value ( @xmath56 ) can discriminate between models , taking into account and in some cases penalizing additional terms and model complexities , while simultaneously evaluating goodness of fit .",
    "models with larger evidence terms are preferred over those with smaller terms , providing an objective criterion for comparison ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the a370 models ( table [ tbl : modparams ] ) , we find that the evidence of the 3-clump model ( @xmath57 = -303.19 ) is significantly larger than that of the 2-clump model ( @xmath57 = -1817.07 ) , showing that the data strongly prefer a mass distribution that includes a flatter , central `` bar '' component .",
    "the evidence term of the 4-clump model is larger still ( @xmath57 = -201.90 )  though the relative improvement over the 3-clump model is not as great  again suggesting a real need for the crown clump",
    ". finally , although the more complex 5-clump model has a marginally improved fit over the 4-clump model ( rms = 0.88 ) , its evidence value actually decreases ( @xmath58 = -202.67 ) suggesting that the fifth mass clump is unnecessary and that we are beginning to overfit the system .",
    "additional tests , placing the fifth clump at several other locations throughout the crown , yield similar ( or worse ) results .    as a complementary check on overfitting",
    ", we also calculate the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) term for each model : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the model likelihood , @xmath61 is the number of model free parameters , and @xmath62 is the number of model constraints .",
    "lower bic values are favored over higher values , and for our models , we again see that the 4-clump case ( bic = 455.35 ) is preferred over all others ( we present all values in table [ tbl : modparams ] ) , bolstering the claim that the bar and the crown are real , necessary features .    on the physical side of the evidence argument",
    ", we first turn to the cluster light distribution .",
    "as previously mentioned , the presence of the northern crown of galaxies already suggests an additional mass distribution not captured by the two - clump model . to test this theory , we first isolate the cluster light in the f814w band ( the filter where cluster members are brightest ) , keeping only the objects selected by the cluster - member color - color cut ( section [ model ] ) and masking the rest .",
    "we then smooth the remaining light with a gaussian kernel ( @xmath63 ) , providing a cleaner view of the light distribution . comparing this distribution to the 4-clump mass model ( figure [ fig : compare ] , left )",
    ", we find good agreement between the brightest points of the light map and the positions of the large - scale clumps .",
    "as expected , the southern cluster halo sits near the southern bcg , the combined northern cluster halo and bar surround the northern bcg , and the fourth clump sits on the eastern side of the crown .",
    "even more promisingly , the orientation of the fourth mass clump is aligned with the distribution of the crown light , even though it is allowed to vary freely in the model .",
    "assuming then that , at least to some degree , the presence of light traces the presence of mass , the agreement between the light map and mass model provides another argument in favor of the 4-clump model",
    ".    finally , we also look at the a370 x - ray gas profile , as the presence of hot x - ray gas is often used as a tracer of deep mass potentials . for this",
    ", we turn to publicly available , deep chandra data : an 88 ks image of a370 , observed using the using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer s - array ( acis - s ) camera ( i d : 08700025 , pi : g. garmire ) . after smoothing the x - ray map using the ` asmooth ` algorithm @xcite , we compare the smoothed x - ray map to the positions of the 4-clump mass model components ( figure [ fig : compare ] , right ) .",
    "while the results here are not as definitive as in the cluster - light case , we do still see a moderate agreement between the map and the clump positions . generally , the x - ray contours are also slightly extended in the vicinity of the crown clump , again hinting at the presence of an additional potential well .",
    "focusing more closely on the x - ray contours , we can see that they follow a distinct box - like pattern , which is especially noticeable in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "interestingly , the mass contours in the 4-clump model have a similar shape , largely driven by the overlap between the northern cluster halo and the central bar . given the rough agreement between the x - ray and mass contours , it is possible that the best - fit positions of the northern mass clumps are more than a simple degeneracy , but instead driven by physical parameters .",
    "thus , taken as a whole , the combination of physical and statistical evidence indicate that the additional mass clumps in the cluster center and crown region are necessary components of the mass model .",
    "this suggests an even more complex mass distribution than previously thought , motivating future studies in this area .",
    "thanks to the discovery of several new lensing constraints , our picture of the a370 mass distribution is beginning to evolve .",
    "while the addition of new mass clumps is the largest change , it is not the only difference . to get a better understanding of these changes and what they mean physically",
    ", we can compare our model to previous results .",
    "this is especially easy with the models presented by @xcite and @xcite , since they were both also generated with ` lenstool ` , using a similar set of parameters . on the whole , while the total mass of a370 remains largely unchanged between models , where the mass enclosed within a 500 kpc circular radius is @xmath64 in each case , the distribution of mass between various components does not . in particular , we find that the cluster halo associated with the southern bcg ( dm1 ) is much rounder and more compact than either of the previous models , flattening the mass profile in this region .",
    "this is predominantly due to the number of radial , 5-image systems seen near the southern cluster ( systems 7 , 14 , and 15 ) , as a more elliptical mass distribution would break the symmetry and destroy the radial arcs .",
    "conversely , the northern cluster halo ( dm2 ) is more elliptical and tilted at a steeper angle away from north , though this is largely caused by an interaction with the central bar component .",
    "both cluster potentials are also considerably less massive in our model , which is another consequence of the bar .",
    "finally , we note that our model favors a significantly larger @xmath65 galaxy velocity dispersion , placing more emphasis on localized substructure contributions to the total mass profile .",

    "furthermore , the radial critical region ( traced out by the internal orange line ) is much larger in our model .",

    ", important spatial information is lost when the mass map is radially averaged , so it is important to look for differences in the full 2d mass distribution , as well . for this test",
    ", we compare our 4-clump model to the free - form model presented in @xcite , which is also generated from hff data , but constructed in a completely independent way , reducing potential sources of unknown bias . to make the comparison",
    ", we subtract the free - form model s mass density map from our own map , measuring relative differences on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "the results can be seen in figure [ fig:2dmap ] .",
    "overall , we do see differences between the two approaches : the @xcite model is generally more concentrated and slightly rounder .",
    "our parametric approach shows a noticeable overdensity in the vicinity of the crown , due to the crown mass clump ( dm4 ) in the east , and the extension of the northern cluster clump and the central bar ( dm2 and dm3 , respectively ) in the northwest .",
    "the parametric model also has a larger fraction of total mass in the outskirts of the cluster , which is also seen in the radial profile presented in figure [ fig : compare2 ] . while model differences can be large at large radii ",
    "the parametric model is rougly twice as dense as the free - form model at the edges of the map  we note that the absolute mass density values at these distances are very small ( @xmath106 kpc@xmath54 ) and contribute a negligible amount to the total mass budget .",
    "conversely , the relative differences near the cluster center are typically less than 10 percent , resulting in an overall good agreement between the two models .",
    "finally , we can compare our model ( and all models ) of a370 to other clusters in the hff program .",
    "the combined rms error for our best fit model ( @xmath107 = 0.94 ) is higher than the error presented in @xcite ( @xmath107 = 0.82 ) , comparable to the error in @xcite ( @xmath107 = 0.93 ) , and smaller than the error presented in @xcite ( @xmath107 = 1.76 ) .",
    "however all of these rms values are larger than the best fit models of most other hff clusters , such as macs 0416 ( @xmath107 = 0.5 ; @xcite ) or abell 2744 ( @xmath107 = 0.7 ; @xcite ) . instead ,",
    "while not as large , our rms is more similar to macs 0717 ( @xmath107 = 1.9 ; @xcite ) . like macs 0717 , a370 is a complex cluster , with several interacting mass components covering a large field of view . in fact , the a370 `` multiple - image zone '' ( figure [ fig : zcrit ] ) , the region predicted to contain all multiple images out to high redshift ( @xmath108 ) , is the second largest of all of the frontier fields , behind only macs 0717 . given the similarities , it is therefore unsurprising that the typical rms is also high .    to reduce the total rms further ,",
    "we need to explore the other areas of the cluster with muse .",
    "this will help to refine the model even more and allow us to test whether or not our current interpretation is correct .",
    "in particular , the crown mass clump may only be a temporary solution ; future data may require additional large - scale halos , or even suggest an alternative to the crown .",
    "we can not be sure of this until we have additional constraints in the north .",
    "fortunately , such a survey is currently underway ( pi f. bauer ) , and the results of this study will be the topic of a future paper .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new mass model for the a370 cluster , taking advantage of deep hff imaging and new muse spectroscopy .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * we present a muse - based redshift catalog for a370 , consisting of 120 secure redshifts ( @xmath109 ) , including 34 multiply - imaged background objects ( comprising 15 unique systems ) , 13 singly - imaged background galaxies , 56 cluster members , 13 foreground galaxies , and 4 stars . * together , hff and muse data are a powerful combination , greatly improving our ability to construct lens models .",
    "muse spectroscopy is particularly valuable for this work , as it can be used to blindly identify new lensing constraints without selecting a specific redshift range . * after constructing a mass model with the new multiply - imaged constraints , we find two key differences with previous work : + 1 . ) a central core that is flatter and less massive due to an increase in radial lensing systems + 2 . )",
    "the need for additional large - scale mass clumps ( `` the bar '' and `` the crown '' ) to better fit lensing constraints in the north of the cluster * a lack of model constraints in the north makes accurate comparisons difficult .",
    "we will need more muse data , covering a larger area of the a370 cluster to discriminate between possible interpretations .",
    "these data are currently being taken , and will be the subject of an upcoming paper .",
    "additionally , our model can be used as a guide for upcoming observations , as high - magnification regions in our models ( figure [ fig : zcrit ] ) should be ideal places to look for new , magnified high - redshift galaxies . with new muse spectroscopy on the way",
    ", the a370 cluster should continue to provide a wealth of new information in the future .",
