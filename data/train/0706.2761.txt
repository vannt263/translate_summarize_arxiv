    "the pioneering paper by christen and bttiker @xcite has stimulated much interest to rectification in quantum wires and other mesoscopic systems .",
    "most attention was focused on the simplest case of fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "recently this research was extended to strongly interacting systems where luttinger liquids are formed @xcite .",
    "one of the topics of current interest is the rectification effect in luttinger liquids in a magnetic field @xcite . in the presence of a magnetic field , both spin and charge currents",
    "can be generated .",
    "so far , however , only charge currents in luttinger liquids have been studied . in this paper",
    "we show that a dc spin current can be generated by an ac voltage bias in a single - channel quantum wire .    in recent years",
    "many approaches to the generation of spin currents in quantum wires were put forward . typically both , spin and charge currents are generated and the spin current expressed in units of @xmath0 per second",
    "is smaller than the electric current in units of @xmath1 per second ( @xmath1 is the electron charge ) .",
    "such a situation naturally emerges in partially polarized systems since each electron carries the charge @xmath1 and its spin projection on the @xmath2-axis is @xmath3 .",
    "a proposal how to obtain a spin current _ exceeding _ the charge current in a quantum wire was published by sharma and chamon @xcite who considered a luttinger liquid in the presence of a time - dependent magnetic field in a region of the size of an electron wavelength . in a very different physical context",
    ", a spin current without charge current was predicted for edge modes in the quantum hall effect in graphene @xcite .",
    "pure spin currents can also flow in open circuits which can not support charge currents @xcite . in this paper , we show that the generation of a dc spin current exceeding the charge current is also possible in closed circuits without time - dependent magnetic fields . the spin current can be generated in a spatially asymmetric luttinger liquid system in the presence of an ac bias .",
    "interestingly , in a certain interval of low voltages the dc spin current grows as a negative power of the ac voltage when the voltage decreases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section contains a qualitative discussion .",
    "we briefly address the simplest case of non - interacting electrons , discuss its differences from the most interesting case of strong electron interaction and estimate at what conditions the effect can be observed .",
    "section [ sec : bosonization ] contains the details of the bosonization procedure which we use to treat the electron - electron interaction . in section [ sec : rectification ] we calculate analytically the spin and charge rectification currents in the presence of a weak asymmetric potential .",
    "numerical results for a simple model with strong asymmetric potential are discussed in appendix [ sec : high_barrier ] .",
    "appendices [ sec : higher_orders ] and [ sec:3rd_order ] contain technical details of the perturbation theory employed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rectification ] .",
    "the rectifying quantum wire is sketched in fig .  [ fig : system ] .",
    "it consists of a one - dimensional conductor with a scatterer in the center of the system at @xmath4 .",
    "the scatterer creates an asymmetric potential @xmath5 .",
    "the size of the scatterer @xmath6 is of the order of the electron wavelength .",
    "a spin current can be generated only if time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "thus , we assume that the system is placed in a uniform magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the field defines the @xmath8 direction of the electron spins .",
    "if the wire is sufficiently narrow then the effect of the magnetic field on the kinetic energy of electrons can be neglected and the field enters the problem only via its interaction with the spins . at its two ends , the wire is connected to nonmagnetic electrodes , labeled by @xmath9 .",
    "the left electrode , @xmath10 , is controlled by an ac voltage source , while the right electrode , @xmath11 , is kept on ground .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath7 breaks the symmetry between the two orientations of the electron spin . in a uniform wire",
    "this would not result in a net spin current since the conductances of the spin - up and -down channels would be the same,@xcite @xmath12 , and the spin currents of the spin - up and -down electrons would be opposite . in the presence of a potential barrier such",
    "a cancellation does not occur @xcite . in a system with strong electron interaction ,",
    "the spatial asymmetry of the wire leads to an asymmetric @xmath13 curve,@xcite @xmath14 .",
    "thus , an ac voltage bias generates spin and charge dc currents , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    as we will see , the problem is most interesting in the case of strong electron interaction . before addressing that more difficult case ,",
    "let us discuss what happens in the absence of electron interaction . by non - interacting system we mean a wire in which electron - electron interaction is completely screened by the gates .",
    "in such situation the charge density in the wire is not fixed but depends on the gate potential and the electrochemical potentials of the leads .",
    "the leads define the chemical potentials @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the left- and right - moving electrons which are injected from the right and left reservoirs respectively .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the chemical potential @xmath19 and @xmath18 oscillates between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus , in the presence of the magnetic field @xmath7 , the fermi energies counted from the band bottom equal @xmath22 for the left - moving electrons and @xmath23 for the right - movers , where @xmath24 is the electron spin projection , @xmath25 the fermi level in the absence of the magnetic field and voltage bias and @xmath26 the electron magnetic moment .",
    "as we will see , in a strongly interacting system the form of the potential barrier @xmath27 plays little role .",
    "however , it is crucial in the non - interacting case .",
    "let us choose @xmath27 in the form of the double potential barrier so that quasistationary levels @xmath28 , @xmath29 are present ( fig .  [ fig : lr ] ) .",
    "thus , in the non - interacting case we consider a resonant tunneling diode@xcite .",
    "the spin and charge currents as the functions of the chemical potential @xmath18 are @xmath30 @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the electron charge , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the transmission coefficient .",
    "the transmission coefficient is small far from the energies of the quasistationary levels @xmath34 and increases as @xmath35 approaches @xmath28 . obviously , if one applies a dc voltage @xmath36 then the charge current , expressed in units of @xmath1 per second , exceeds the spin current in units of @xmath0 per second .",
    "the situation changes in the presence of an ac bias .",
    "the dc currents generated by an ac voltage bias can be estimated as @xmath37/2 $ ] .",
    "let us now assume that the magnetic field is tuned such that the fermi level of the spin - down electrons @xmath38 is close to the quasistationary level @xmath39 and exceeds @xmath39 while the fermi level of the spin - up electrons @xmath40 is close to @xmath41 and lies below @xmath41 .",
    "let also @xmath42 be smaller than the distances , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , between the fermi levels and quasistationary levels in the absence of the voltage bias .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath45 . from the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath33 near the resonant levels , one finds that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "hence , @xmath48 . by an appropriate choice of parameters",
    ", one can produce any ratio of the spin and charge rectification currents .",
    "note that the rectification effect for non - interacting electrons is possible even if the potential @xmath27 is symmetric .",
    "the asymmetry of the system , necessary for rectification , is introduced by the applied voltage bias .",
    "the charge density injected into the wire from the leads is proportional to @xmath49 and hence is different for the opposite signs of the voltage .",
    "if the injected charge density were independent of the voltage sign , i.e. @xmath18 oscillated between @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 oscillated between @xmath51 and @xmath50 , then the rectification effect would be impossible for non - interacting electrons .",
    "this follows from eqs .",
    "( [ i_c_add]-[3 - 0_add ] ) and the fact that the transmission coefficient @xmath33 is independent of the direction of the incoming wave for non - interacting particles@xcite . in the presence of electron repulsion both the asymmetry of the potential and the voltage dependence of the injected charge",
    "contribute to the rectification current .",
    "it turns out , that in the case of strong electron interaction , the rectification effect due to the asymmetry of the potential barrier dominates .",
    "the above example is based on a special form of the potential barrier in the wire and assumes that the magnetic field and chemical potentials are tuned in order to obtain the desired effect . as shown below , in the presence of strong repulsive electron interaction no tuning",
    "is necessary and no quasistationary states are needed to obtain the spin current which is greater than the charge current .",
    "in fact , the spin rectification effect is possible even for weak asymmetric potentials @xmath27 .",
    "this can be understood from the following toy model ( a related model for rectification in a two - dimensional electron gas was studied in ref .  ):",
    "let there be no uniform magnetic field @xmath7 and no asymmetric potential @xmath27 . instead",
    ", both right@xmath53left and spin - up@xmath53spin - down symmetries are broken by a weak coordinate - dependent magnetic field @xmath54 , which is localized in a small region of size @xmath55 ( we do not include the components @xmath56 in the toy model ) .",
    "let us also assume that the spin - up and -down electrons do not interact with the electrons of the opposite spin .",
    "then the system can be described as the combination of two spin - polarized one - channel wires with opposite spin - dependent potentials @xmath57 , where @xmath26 is the electron magnetic moment . according to ref .",
    "an ac bias generates a rectification current in each of those two systems and the currents are proportional to the cubes of the potentials @xmath58 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 .",
    "hence , no net charge current @xmath60 is generated in the leading order . at the same time",
    ", there is a nonzero spin current in the third order in @xmath61 .",
    "a similar effect is present in a more realistic luttinger liquid model considered below .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on the case of weak asymmetric potentials .",
    "a simple model with strong impurities is studied in appendix [ sec : high_barrier ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : noninteract ] and [ fig : interact ] we have represented the results from a numerical evaluation for the spin and charge currents @xmath62 for the potential shown in fig .  [ fig : lr ] .",
    "[ fig : noninteract ] shows the non - interacting case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : interact ] we represent the case of strong electron interaction .",
    "we have chosen parameters ( explained in the figure captions ) such that @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath15 for a range of the applied voltage .",
    "further information on the numerical approach is given in appendix  [ sec : high_barrier ] .",
    "transport in a strongly interacting system in the presence of a strong asymmetric potential @xmath27 is a difficult problem which can not be solved analytically and is sensitive to a particular choice of the potential .",
    "as we have mentioned , appendix [ sec : high_barrier ] contains the numerical analysis of a simple model of interacting electrons with a strong potential barrier . on the other hand",
    ", the interacting problem can be solved analytically in the limit of a weak potential @xmath27 with the help of the bosonization and keldysh techniques ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonization ] ) .",
    "we will see that the rectification current exhibits a number of universal features , independent of the form of the potential @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , in a wide interval of interaction strength , the spin rectification current can exceed the charge rectification current for an arbitrary shape of the asymmetric potential barrier .",
    "rectification is a nonlinear transport phenomenon .",
    "thus , it can not be observed at low voltages at which the @xmath13 curve is linear and hence symmetric . in luttinger liquids",
    "the @xmath13 curve is nonlinear at @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the temperature @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the limit of the zero temperature which corresponds to the strongest rectification .",
    "we expect qualitatively the same behavior at @xmath65 . at higher temperatures",
    "the charge and spin rectification effects disappear .",
    "since the temperatures of the order of millikelvins can be achieved with dilution refrigeration , the rectification effect is possible even for the voltages as low as @xmath66v .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the low - frequency ac bias .",
    "we define the rectification current as the dc response to a low - frequency square voltage wave of amplitude @xmath67 : @xmath68/2,\\ ] ] @xmath69/2.\\ ] ] the above dc currents express via the currents of spin - up and -down electrons : @xmath70 , @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the spin current exceeds the charge current if the signs of @xmath72 and @xmath73 are opposite .",
    "equations ( [ 5_add],[6_add ] ) for the dc - currents do not contain the frequency @xmath74 of the ac - bias .",
    "they are valid as long as the frequency @xmath75 indeed , as shown below , the rectification current is determined by electron backscattering off the asymmetric potential .",
    "hence , one can neglect the time - dependence of the ac voltage in eqs .",
    "( [ 5_add],[6_add ] ) if the period of the ac bias exceeds the duration @xmath76 of one backscattering event .",
    "the time @xmath77 includes two contributions .",
    "@xmath78 is the time of the electron travel across the potential barrier .",
    "@xmath79 comes from the uncertainty of the energy of the backscattered particle . if the barrier amplitude @xmath80 and the barrier occupies a region of size @xmath6 then @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the electron velocity .",
    "the energy uncertainty @xmath83 translates into @xmath84 .",
    "thus , for @xmath85 one obtains the condition ( [ 7_add ] ) . the same condition can be derived with the approach of appendix a of ref . and emerges in a related problem @xcite .",
    "note that for realistic voltages the low - frequency condition ( [ 7_add ] ) allows rather high frequencies . even for @xmath86v the maximal @xmath87 ghz .",
    "there remains the question of the asymmetric impurity : we require a potential @xmath27 that is localized within @xmath55 .",
    "a possible realization is to generate two different ( symmetric ) local potentials by two gates within a distance @xmath88 or an electric potential created by an asymmetric gate of size @xmath55 placed at the distance @xmath55 from the wire .",
    "electron densities of @xmath89 are possible nowadays in 2-dimensional electron gases , yielding @xmath90 up to several 10 nm .",
    "confinement in a one - dimensional wire will reduce the electron density further so that this number may increase further .",
    "modern techniques allow placing electric gates of widths of @xmath91 nm at distances of @xmath92 nm .",
    "a realization of an asymmetric potential in this way is , therefore , within the reach .",
    "alternatively , in the case of shorter electron wave - length , it should be possible to place an asymmetrically shaped stm tip close to the wire .",
    "an applied bias would yield an asymmetric scattering potential .",
    "with such a tip the asymmetry can not be directly tuned , but most of our predictions are not sensitive to the precise shape of the potential . certainly , an asymmetric potential may simply emerge by chance due to the presence of two point impurities of unequal strength at the distance @xmath55 .",
    "at @xmath93 , the calculation of the rectification currents reduces to the calculation of the stationary contributions to the dc @xmath13 curves @xmath94 and @xmath95 that are even in the voltage @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that the coulomb interaction between distant charges is screened by the gates .",
    "this will allow us to use the standard tomonaga - luttinger model with short range interactions .",
    "@xcite electric fields of external charges are also assumed to be screened .",
    "thus , the applied voltage reveals itself only as the difference of the electrochemical potentials @xmath41 and @xmath96 of the particles injected from the left and right reservoirs .",
    "we assume that one lead is connected to the ground so that its electrochemical potential @xmath97 is fixed .",
    "the electrochemical potential of the second lead @xmath98 is controlled by the voltage source ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] ) .",
    "since the tomonaga - luttinger model captures only low - energy physics , we assume that @xmath99 , where @xmath25 is of the order of the bandwidth .",
    "rectification occurs due to backscattering off the asymmetric potential @xmath27 .",
    "we will assume that the asymmetric potential is weak , @xmath100 .",
    "this will enable us to use perturbation theory .",
