    "ultracold atomic fermi gases have been a rapidly growing field over the past decade , and have attracted enormous attentions from various disciplines including condensed matter , atomic and molecular physics , nuclear matter and astrophysics . owing to the high tunability of multiple parameters ,",
    "atomic fermi gases have become a prototype for quantum simulations of a vast range of existing quantum systems in , e.g. , condensed matter and for engineering highly exotic quantum states @xcite .",
    "one such system is superconductors with a tunable interaction strength . despite",
    "that atomic fermi gases can be prepared as a clean system without an impurity , impurities are hard to avoid in a typical condensed matter system , including the most important and widely studied high @xmath2 cuprate and fe - based superconductors .",
    "therefore , study of the impurity effects on the superfluidity and pairing phenomena using an atomic fermi gas is very important .",
    "associated naturally with a two - component fermi gas is the physics of superfluidity and pairing , whose counterpart condensed matter system is superconductivity .",
    "the related impurity effects in superconductors have also been an important subject , including superconducting alloys@xcite , disordered high @xmath2 superconductors@xcite , disordered superconducting thin films and the disorder induced superconductor - insulator transition @xcite , etc . while the impurity effects in conventional phonon - mediated @xmath0-wave superconductors have been understood fairly well , the pseudogap phenomena in ( @xmath3-wave ) cuprate superconductors have introduced further complexity @xcite . unlike a typical superconductor , the pairing interaction strength in atomic fermi gases can be tuned via a feshbach resonance from weak to strong , effecting a crossover from bcs superfluidity to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "pseudogap phenomena have been widely recognized as the pairing strength become strong .",
    "it is thus interesting to go beyond weak coupling bcs theory and study the impurity effects in the presence of strong pairing .",
    "indeed , experimentally , impurities can be introduced via doping atoms of foreign elements @xcite or using a random optical potential @xcite .    in a conventional @xmath0-wave bcs superconductor , weak impurities",
    "renormalize the frequency @xmath4 and gap @xmath5 in the exact same fashion @xcite , such that their effects are canceled out in the gap equation , leading to the anderson s theorem @xcite , with an unchanged superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 . for a @xmath3-wave superconductor",
    ", it has been known that impurities often lead to a quadratic temperature dependence for the low temperature london penetration depth or superfluid density .",
    "chen and schrieffer @xcite have studied the effects of nonmagnetic impurities for a @xmath3-wave superconductor on a quasi - two - dimensional lattice from the born to unitary limits of the impurity scattering strength , and for both weak and strong pairing strengths . on the other hand ,",
    "since no strong pairing @xmath0-wave superconductors have been found thus far , there has been very few studies of the impurity effects in strong pairing @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "orso studied bcs - bec crossover in a random external potential @xcite , based on the nozieres and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory @xcite , which has been known to suffer from inconsistencies between its @xmath2 equation and fermion number equation in terms of the self - energy contributions of pairing fluctuations .",
    "han and sa de melo @xcite studied the bcs - bec crossover in the presence of disorder , using functional integrals and a local density approximation , which requires the interaction range of the disorder be much larger than the pair size .",
    "recently , strinati and coworkers @xcite studied the impurity effects in the context of bcs - bec crossover , but at the lowest order , using a diagrammatic approach , which does not have a pseudogap in the @xmath2 equation even in the strong pairing regime , where the presence of a pseudogap has been established experimentally . at the same time",
    ", higher order contributions from impurity scattering in the strong scattering regime are missing in their treatment , and the impurity and pairing @xmath1-matrices are not treated in a self - consistent fashion , either .    in this paper , we will present a systematic treatment of the impurity effects on a two - component ultracold atomic fermi gas as a function of the impurity strength , impurity concentration , and pairing interaction strength , in the case of @xmath0-wave pairing throughout the bcs - bec crossover . we will use the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the pairing fluctuations and nonmagnetic impurity @xmath1-matrix are treated self - consistently . while the original formalism was applied to @xmath3-wave pairing on a quasi - two - dimensional lattice , relevant to cuprate superconductors , here we apply it to @xmath0-wave pairing throughout the entire bcs - bec crossover in a three dimensional ( 3d ) atomic fermi gas . unlike the nodal @xmath6-wave @xcite and @xmath3-wave cases @xcite , where the gap renormalization vanishes , for the @xmath0-wave pairing , both of the frequency and gap renormalization induced by impurities are present . only for weak impurity scattering ( i.e. , the born limit ) , where the impurity potential may be treated at the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) level ,",
    "the frequency and gap renormalization factors are exactly the same so that the anderson s theorem is valid @xcite .",
    "our main results are as follows : ( a ) in the presence of strong impurity scattering , the frequency and the gap function are highly renormalized , leading to significant suppression of the superfluid @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) in the bcs regime , impurities induce impurity bands , subgap states and strong smearing of the coherent peak ( cp ) , thus the superfluidity may be readily destroyed by the impurity .",
    "besides , we find an effective power law dependence of @xmath2 as a function of pairing strength@xcite .",
    "( c ) superfluidity in the unitary and bec regimes is relatively more robust than in the bcs regime .",
    "( d ) @xmath7-wave pairing is less sensitive to impurity than its @xmath3-wave counterpart@xcite .",
    "( e ) strong impurity scatterers are much more effective than weak scatterers in the born limit , in suppressing @xmath2 , order parameter , and the superfluid density .",
    "it should be noticed that there are also other theoretical approaches toward the interplay of bcs - bec crossover and impurity , mainly using functional integral formalism and the replica trick @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in section",

    "we choose strong impurities in the unitary limit , with @xmath183 , and calculate for three representative impurity densities of @xmath209 ( clean , black solid curve ) , @xmath210 ( red dotted curve ) , @xmath211 ( blue dashed curve ) , respectively . for clarity",

    "such a non - monotonic and non - constant behavior signals the breakdown of anderson s theorem for strong impurities .",
    "we note here that this ratio is rather different from the mean - field value of 1.76 , due to primarily the presence of a pseudogap at @xmath2 besides the impurity effects .    with the calculated gap parameters , we show the corresponding calculated superfluid density as a function of temperature for the above the three impurity densities in fig .

    "finally , we note that it requires some effort to realize a homogeneous fermi gas in the presence of impurities .",
    "first , atomic fermi gases are always confined in a trapping potential .",
    "the impurities should be confined within this trapping potential as well .",
    "to improve the situation , one may use a combination of different lasers to create a rather flat trap to make the system as close to homogeneous as possible .",
    "second , while the impurities may be realized by doping with heavy atoms , a more elaborate treatment may need to consider the finite mass of these impurity atoms . in this way , a different impurity scattering hamiltonian will have to be used .",
    "third , an alternative to realize impurities is to create ( pseudo-)randomly distributed optical speckles in the trap . in this case , these speckles may be regarded as infinitely heavy impurities so that the scattering of atoms is elastic , as assumed in our theory . nevertheless , the present theory can be regarded as a first step toward a more realistic treatment of a real fermi gas system with random impurities .",
    "spin flip ( i.e. , `` magnetic '' ) impurity scattering will also be considered in future works .",
    "furthermore , we shall also include the particle - hole channel contributions @xcite as well .",
    "in summary , we have studied the effects of impurities on the @xmath0-wave bcs - bec crossover in ultracold atomic fermi gases , including the impurity effects on frequency and gap renormalizations , fermion density of states , superfluid @xmath2 , as well as finite temperature gaps and superfluid density .",
    "our results reveal that while the system is less sensitive to impurities in the born limit , strong impurities in the unitary scattering regime cause a much stronger renormalization for both the frequency and the gaps throughout the entire bcs - bec crossover , leading to a finite lifetime of bogoliubov quasiparticles and fermion pairs , and hence a significant suppression of the superfluid @xmath2 and superfluid density .",
    "the anderson s theorem breaks down except for weak impurities in the bcs regime .",
    "indeed , in the weak coupling bcs regime , where the gap is small , strong impurities at moderately high densities may readily destroy the superfluidity and suppress @xmath2 down to zero , leading to an effective power law dependence on the pairing strength .",
    "such a bcs - bec crossover phenomenon in the presence of impurities may be realized experimentally by introducing atoms of foreign elements or using optical speckles , with feshbach resonance in fermi gases of @xmath8li or @xmath9k .",
