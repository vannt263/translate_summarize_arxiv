    "the time needed for a particle contained in a confining domain with a single small opening to exit the domain for the first time , usually referred as _",
    "narrow escape time _ problem ( net ) , finds a prominent place in many domains and fields .",
    "for instance in cellular biology , it is related to the random time needed by a particle released inside a cell to activate a given mechanism on the cell membrane ( @xcite ) . generally speaking",
    "the net problem is part of the so called _ intermittent processes _ , which are used to explain scenarios ranging from animal search patterns ( @xcite ) , through the solutions or melts of synthetic macromolecules ( @xcite ) , to the manufacture of self - assembled mono- and multi - layers ( @xcite ) . since the work of berg and purcell ( @xcite ) , research in the net problem area has experienced a steady growth over time and motivated a great deal of work ( @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    ", we have introduced an analytical markovian model that showed the impact of geometrical parameters and the interplay between surface and boundary paths in the studied confining domain , of a discrete and rectangular shaped nature , for the perfect trapping case . with `` perfect trapping '' we refer to the particle s impossibility of return to the system , i.e. once the particle reaches the narrow opening the escape becomes certain . in that work we presented a phase diagram which showed that some combinations of the geometrical parameter and the transport mechanism were required for the existence of an optimal transport ( a global minimum in the net ) .    in this work",
    "we consider the same confining domain and the transport properties that we dealt with in ref .",
    "however we eliminate the assumption of perfect escape introducing a finite transition probability at the narrow escape window .",
    "it is well known that systems description through the `` imperfect trapping case '' ( once in the trap site capture is not certain ) are suitable whenever the surface contains ` deep traps ' , capture and re - emission from a surface that contains sites with several internal states such as the ` ladder trapping model ' , proteins with active sites deep inside its matrix , etc .",
    "( @xcite ) . under this new assumption",
    ", we have discovered some very interesting results .",
    "particularly we show that the existence of a global minimum in the net depends on the existence of an imperfection in the trapping process .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the influence of the ` imperfection ' in the passage through the escape window on the effective diffusion process , and its effect on the net problem . for that purpose",
    "we calculate the time required by the particle to escape from the system ( met ) . in order to perform our research",
    "we exploit dyson s theory ( @xcite ) , and the notions of _ absorption probability density _",
    "( apd ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the following section we introduce some general results regarding imperfect trapping process as well as our model , and provide the basic definitions and concepts .",
    "we also describe the proposed analytical approach and present the main results .",
    "section iii depicts several assorted illustrations for the met to the narrow opening for different configurations of the system through a comparison between our analytical framework and monte carlo simulations . in section",
    "iv we discuss our conclusions and perspectives . finally , in the appendix we present the calculations indicated in section ii .",
    "let us consider the problem of a walker making a random walk in some finite domain with a trap or sink present in the system .",
    "we will follow the walker evolution through the system considering the ` unrestricted ' conditional probability @xmath3 , that is , the probability that a walker is at @xmath4 at time @xmath5 given it was at @xmath6 at @xmath7 . by ` unrestricted '",
    "we identify a situation with no traps / sinks present in the system .    .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the _ first passage time _",
    "approach is not fully applicable since an ` excursion ' to the trapping site does not necessarily ends the process .",
    "however we show in the following lines that an interesting relation could be established between latexmath:[$a(\\vec{s},t    passage time density ( fptd ) through the site @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , given that the walker was at @xmath6 at time @xmath9 .",

    "( [ apd2 ] ) as @xmath22 the term @xmath23 in ( [ apd3 ] ) gives the fraction of walkers that are trapped while @xmath24 gives the ones that are not absorbed .",
    "further considerations could be made regarding ( [ apd3 ] ) , we write it as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 notice that @xmath27 accounts for that walkers that are absorbed in the @xmath28-visit ( @xmath29 ) and _ not before _ , i.e. , the walkers arrive for the first time at site @xmath30 from @xmath6 but these are not absorbed until they return to site @xmath30 for the @xmath31-time .",

    "we have included for comparison the ` perfect escape case ' , i.e. once in the escape window the escape is instantaneous , with no dwelling time .",

    "however it is worth remarking that the transition rate at the escape window can contribute positively as well .",
    "this behavior is well depicted in figure  [ fig4 ] .    , with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , for different values of @xmath0 ( transition rate at the escape window ) . from bottom to top @xmath107 .",

    "we will consider the behaviour of @xmath157 .",
    "even though we were not able to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath95 , its derivate with respect to @xmath54 could be evaluated in closed form . to do this recall equation and differentiate it with respect to @xmath54 considering @xmath158 ( with the other parameters held fixed ) .",
    "then after some algebra we obtain , @xmath159 from ( [ dif_delta_beta ] ) we could obtain the entry points to the @xmath54 axis of @xmath95 curves .",
    "the forerunner for this is the sharp growth on the @xmath95 curves in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    "the abrupt increase is in @xmath160 .",
    "however is not difficult to show that this happens only if the denominator in ( [ dif_delta_beta ] ) @xmath161 for some @xmath114 ( also notice that in this situation @xmath162 ) so , @xmath163 where we have used ( [ delta_min_b ] ) to replace the sum on the right hand side .",
    "we could go even further and replace the sum on the left hand side .",
    "for this we differentiate ( [ delta_min_b ] ) with respect to @xmath95 and get @xmath164 . by using this relation and rearranging some terms in ( [ beta_lim_nub ] )",
    "we finally obtain , @xmath165 the solution of equation ( [ beta_lim_nub_fin ] ) in terms of @xmath114 that makes @xmath115 marks the end of the interval in which @xmath95 exists i.e. , the t curve becomes monotonous .",
    "for the perfect escape case we obtain one of the asymptotes between which @xmath95 exits , outside them the extrema is pushed either to @xmath1 or to @xmath2 , by letting @xmath37 in ( [ beta_lim_nub_fin ] ) , @xmath166 for the second asymptote we go back to ( [ dif_delta_beta ] ) , follow a similar reasoning that lead us to equation ( [ beta_lim_nub ] ) , here @xmath98 , @xmath120 , and obtain , @xmath167 equations ( [ beta_lim_inf_b1 ] ) and ( [ beta_lim_inf_b2 ] ) constitute an improvement to the bounds derived in @xcite and the solution of equation ( [ beta_lim_nub_fin ] ) gives a bound ( we could not find similar results in the literature known by us ) regarding the existence of a minimum in the met .",
