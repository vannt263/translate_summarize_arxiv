    "excitonic insulator ( ei ) phases show a spontaneous coherence between conduction - band electrons and valence - band holes , where the prior formation of bound electron - hole pairs ( excitons ) is typically triggered by the interband coulomb interaction .",

    "it is important to note that the ei  despite representing a macroscopic , phase - coherent quantum state  does not necessarily feature supertransport properties .",

    "the condensation of spin - triplet excitons was also predicted to occur in the proximity of the spin - state transition,@xcite of which pr@xmath9ca@xmath9coo@xmath10 is an example.@xcite likewise , the structural phase transition of the layered chalcogenide ta@xmath5nise@xmath11 has been attributed to a spin - singlet ei@xcite . the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state of iron - pnictide superconductors",

    "although the spin - singlet excitonic state has been investigated in the spinless multiband model with electron - phonon coupling@xcite , not much is known about the role of the electron - phonon coupling played in the excitonic density wave states in the spinful multiband hubbard model .    motivated by the recent developments in the field , in this paper",

    "we note that the sdw - cdw transition is a first - order transition , within the limits of our approximations .",
    "first , let us discuss implications of our findings on materials aspects . the transition - metal chalcogenides 1@xmath13-tise@xmath5 and ta@xmath5nise@xmath11 have recently been discussed in terms of the spin - singlet ei . in these systems , the valence and conduction bands are formed by orbitals located on different atoms .",
    "for example , in @xmath4-tise@xmath5 , the @xmath165 orbitals of se ions account for the valence bands and the @xmath166 orbitals of ti ions account for the conduction bands@xcite , and in ta@xmath5nise@xmath11 , the @xmath166 orbitals of ni ions form the valence bands and the @xmath167 orbitals of ta ions form the conduction bands@xcite .",
    "hund s rule coupling , acting between electrons on different orbitals of a single ion and favoring the spin - triplet excitons , is therefore negligible .",
    "rather , in these materials , the electron - phonon coupling is at play and will stabilize a spin - singlet ei state .",
    "the interband coulomb interaction and electron - phonon interaction , which are inherently interrelated in these materials , will cooperatively stabilize the ei cdw , which is predominantly phononic or excitonic depending on the importance of electron - phonon or coulomb effects .",
    "by contrast , in the iron - pnictide superconductors@xcite and co oxides@xcite , the valence and conduction bands are formed by the @xmath168 orbitals on the ( same ) transition - metal ions , so that the hund s rule coupling is expected to be strong .",
    "hence , in these materials , the sdw phase , if really excitonic in origin , is rather triggered by the hund s rule coupling than by electron - phonon coupling .",
    "then , as our phase diagram suggests , the condensation of spin - triplet excitons will play a major role .",
    "second , let us comment on the phase of the excitonic order parameters .",
    "on the one hand , as we have shown in the preceding section , the electron - phonon interaction stabilizes the spin - singlet excitonic condensate , whereas exchange interactions such as the hund s rule couplings stabilize a spin - triplet excitonic condensate in the otherwise degenerate excitonic density - wave states . on the other hand , these interactions , in particular the electron - phonon and pair - hopping interactions , will fix the phase of the order parameter of the excitonic state ; see sec .",
    "iii  a. because the spatial modulations of the cdw and sdw are given by @xmath169 , the phase @xmath170 may lead to a translational motion of the condensate as a whole@xcite .",
    "if the energy of the condensate is independent of the phase , maintaining the continuous symmetry of the system with respect to the phase , a gapless acoustic phase mode may appear in the excitation spectrum , allowing for a translational motion of the condensate without loss of energy ( i.e. , superfluidity ) , as predicted by frhlich in his theory of incommensurate density waves@xcite .",
    "in real materials , however , excitonic condensation will be influenced by the lattice degrees of freedom or affected by the pair - hopping term .",
    "then the phase of the condensate is fixed and a gap opens for the collective phase mode .",
    "this makes realization of excitonic superfluidity in real materials unlikely .    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied the stability of the excitonic states with charge and spin density modulations in terms of the two - band hubbard model , supplemented by electron - phonon and hund s rule interactions , where the static mean - field theory is employed for coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom and the variational cluster approximations for the electron correlations .",
    "we have shown that both the interband coulomb interaction @xmath14 and the electron - phonon coupling @xmath15 tend to stabilize an excitonic cdw state .",
    "while at @xmath141 the excitonic insulator exhibits an acoustic phase mode , any finite @xmath15 fixes the phase of the order parameter and therefore eliminates such a gapless excitation related to supertransport properties .",
    "the cdw typifies a predominantly excitonic and phononic state for small and large ratios @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "the hund s rule coupling @xmath17 , on the other hand , promotes an excitonic sdw phase , which is further stabilized by pair - hopping processes , which also fixes the phase of the order parameter .",
    "these results obtained for a generic microscopic model hamiltonian should contribute to a better understanding of exciton condensation in several material classes with strong electronic correlations .",

    "<S> we analyze the stability of excitonic ground states in the two - band hubbard model with additional electron - phonon and hund s rule couplings using a combination of mean - field and variational cluster approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the interband coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon interaction will cooperatively stabilize a charge density wave ( cdw ) state which typifies an `` excitonic '' cdw if predominantly triggered by the effective interorbital electron - hole attraction or a `` phononic '' cdw if mostly caused by the coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the hund s rule coupling promotes an excitonic spin density wave . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the transition between excitonic charge and spin density waves and comment on a fixation of the phase of the excitonic order parameter that would prevent the formation of a superfluid condensate of excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for exciton condensation in several material classes with strongly correlated electrons are discussed . </S>"
