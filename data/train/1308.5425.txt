    "it is a classical result that if @xmath21 solves the for @xmath9 , and one component is outgoing , then so is the other . when @xmath31 the equations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 decouple",
    "; the divergence equations ,  , are no longer a consequence of the curl equations , but are nonetheless assumed to hold .    in this paper our emphasis shifts to an application of the debye source representation in bounded domains @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is smooth , but allow it to have multiple connected components .",
    "the debye source representation uses non - physical scalar sources along with harmonic 1-forms on @xmath5 to represent the space of solutions to   in a manner that is insensitive to the choice of wave number @xmath33 .",
    "the debye sources are used to define a pair of pseudocurrents @xmath34 and @xmath35 on @xmath5 , which we call _ debye currents_. for an appropriate relationship between these pseudocurrents , e.g.  , we show that the debye source representation is injective .",
    "this representation leads to fredholm equations of the second kind for solutions to   with specified tangential @xmath16 or @xmath17 components along @xmath5 ; this implies that the representation with the restricted source data is also surjective .",

    "this shows that the debye representation provides a uniformization of this complex structure on @xmath41 : for any value of @xmath0 , the structure @xmath40 is represented by a _ fixed _ linear transformation on a _ fixed _ vector space .",
    "this observation leads to effective numerical methods for solving the beltrami equation in either a bounded or unbounded domain .",
