    "photonic crystals ( phc ) embedded in planar waveguides , also called phc slabs , are at the heart of current research on photonic crystals@xcite because of the possibility of confining light in all spatial directions combined with the advantage of a lithographic definition of the pattern . the propagation of light in these systems can be controlled by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic lattice in the waveguide plane , and by total internal reflection in the perpendicular direction . waveguides with strong refractive index contrast ( like the suspended membrane , or air bridge ) support truly guided modes lying below the light line dispersion in the cladding materials.@xcite however , most of the photonic modes ( or all of them , in the case of waveguides with weak refractive index contrast ) lie above the light line and are only quasi - guided , as they are subject to intrinsic losses due to out - of - plane diffraction.@xcite    the physical properties of phc slabs can be significantly different from those of the corresponding 2d system , for several reasons . first , the 2d photonic modes are subject to confinement in the vertical waveguide and the resulting blue shift is strongly polarization - dependent .",
    "second , the presence of second- and higher - order waveguide modes can produce a complicated pattern of photonic bands , especially for higher - lying states .",
    "third , diffraction losses of quasi - guided modes are an inherent feature of phc slabs which is absent in the ideal 2d case .",
    "for all of these reasons , some basic and well - known properties of 2d photonic crystals can not be easily translated to phc slabs .",
    "for example , it is well known that the triangular lattice of circular air holes in 2d supports a complete photonic band gap for all propagation directions and light polarizations at sufficiently large air fractions.@xcite nevertheless , the same lattice realized in a high - index membrane does not possess a complete band gap , as the odd modes with respect to a horizontal mirror plane ( often called quasi - tm modes ) are subject to a strong and non - uniform blue shift which eliminates the gap.@xcite indeed , most applications of phc slabs employ the even modes ( often called quasi - te ) , which do possess a band gap for all propagation directions .",
    "it was recently suggested@xcite that the triangular lattice of triangular air holes in a high - index membrane gives rise to a complete photonic gap for both even and odd modes .",
    "the physical mechanism is the reduction of symmetry of the basis in the unit cell , as compared to the hexagonal symmetry of the 2d lattice , giving rise to a splitting between the first and the second odd bands at the k point of the brillouin zone : when realized in a high - index membrane , this gap overlaps the usual gap between the first and the second even bands , giving rise to a complete gap for all directions and polarizations .",
    "the experimental results reported in ref .   support the existence of a complete photonic gap .",
    "a main purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic study of the triangular lattice of triangular holes , as compared to the triangular lattice of circular holes , both being realized in a high - index dielectric membrane .",
    "we calculate the photonic band dispersion , gap maps , and intrinsic losses of quasi - guided modes for the 2d lattice .",
    "we also treat line - defect waveguides obtained by removing a full row of holes , and point cavities consisting of three missing holes .",
    "in addition to a determination of photonic gaps for even and odd modes as a function of membrane thickness and air fraction , we compare diffraction losses for the lattices with conventional ( circular ) and reduced symmetry ( triangular ) holes : this comparison is important in order to assess the possible usefulness of the reduced - symmetry lattice . among the results , we find interesting prospects of the triangular lattice of triangular holes for nonlinear optics , as it may allow to achieve doubly - resonant second - harmonic generation ( shg ) with an even ( quasi - te ) fundamental wave and an odd ( quasi - tm ) harmonic wave when line - defect waveguides or photonic cavities are introduced .",
    "the calculations reported in this paper are performed with an approach which we name guided - mode expansion ( gme ) method .",
    "maxwell equations are treated by expanding the magnetic field into the basis of guided modes of an effective homogeneous waveguide , and by solving the resulting eigenvalue equation numerically .",
    "intrinsic losses of quasi - guided modes are obtained by calculating the coupling to leaky modes of the effective waveguide within perturbation theory ( i.e. , the photonic analog of fermi golden rule for quantum - mechanical problems ) .",
    "the gme method , although being an approximate one ( since the basis of guided modes is not a complete basis set ) , has been applied to a variety of photonic lattices and has proven to be useful especially for obtaining quasi - guided modes and their diffraction losses.@xcite it has also been successfully employed for the interpretation of optical experiments on phc slabs.@xcite another purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the gme method , together with convergence tests and exemplifying applications .    the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the gme method and discuss a few convergence tests .",
    "section iii contains the results for the 2d triangular lattice of triangular holes in a high - index membrane , namely photonic dispersion , gap maps and intrinsic losses . in sec .",
    "iv we present a few results for line - defect waveguides and point cavities in the triangular lattice of triangular holes .",
    "section v contains a discussion of the results and of prospective applications of the investigated lattice .",
    "technical details , which are needed by the reader in order to implement the gme method , are given in the appendices .",
    "as phc slabs are intermediate between 2d photonic crystals and dielectric slab waveguides , it is reasonable to describe photonic modes in these systems starting from slab waveguide modes and introducing the effect of a dielectric modulation in the core and cladding layers .",
    "this is the central idea of the guided - mode expansion method , in which phc slab modes are expanded in the basis of guided modes of an effective homogeneous waveguide and coupling to radiative modes is taken into account by perturbation theory . in this section",
    "we describe the formalism for calculating mode dispersion and intrinsic losses , for the general case of an asymmetric phc slab , and discuss convergence of the method .",
    "the system we are considering is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]a .",
    "it consists of a phc slab made of three layers 1,2,3 , each of which is homogeneous in the vertical ( @xmath0 ) direction and is patterned with a 2d photonic lattice in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the core layer has a thickness @xmath2 , while the lower and upper claddings are taken to be semi - infinite.@xcite patterning of each layer is characterized by the same 2d bravais lattice , while the basis in the unit cell can be different - a typical situation is that the core layer 2 is patterned , while layers 1 and 3 are not ( i.e. , they can be described by the same bravais lattice as layer 2 , but with a vanishing air fraction ) .",
    "writing @xmath3 , the dielectric constant @xmath4 is piecewise constant in the @xmath0 direction and takes the form @xmath5 in each layer @xmath6 .",
    "we assume a magnetic permeability @xmath7",
    ".     must have the same 2d bravais lattice for the three layers in ( a ) , but it can have different bases in the unit cell . the change in grey scales in going from ( a ) to ( b )",

    "once the magnetic field of a photonic mode is known , the electric field can be obtained from    @xmath15    and the electric field eigenmodes are orthonormal according to    @xmath16    as is well known@xcite and easily verified .    in order to define an appropriate basis set @xmath17 for the expansion ( [ eq : expansion ] ) , we introduce an effective slab waveguide made of three homogeneous layers with dielectric constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b .",
    "we take @xmath21 as the spatial average of @xmath22 in each layer :    @xmath23    where the integral extends over a unit cell of area @xmath24 .",
    "this choice for the average dielectric constants is convenient , but by no means unique - numerical tests and other issues related to the choice of @xmath21 are discussed in subsec .  [ sec : convergence ] . in any case",
    ", we assume that the average dielectric constants fulfill the inequalities    @xmath25    in order for the effective slab to support a set of guided modes .",
    "their explicit form is well known@xcite and it will be summarized here in order to specify our notation , as well as for the paper to be self - contained .",
    "let us denote by @xmath26 the 2d wavevector in the @xmath1 plane with modulus @xmath27 and unit vector @xmath28 , by @xmath29 a unit vector perpendicular to both * g * and @xmath30 , and by @xmath31 the frequency of a guided mode which satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "moreover we define the following quantities :    @xmath33    which represent the real ( imaginary ) parts of the wavevector in the core ( upper / lower cladding ) , respectively .",
    "the guided mode frequencies are found by solving the following implicit equations ( with the suffix @xmath27 being understood for simplicity ) :    @xmath34    for transverse electric ( te ) polarization , and    @xmath35    for transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization .",
    "the guided modes at a given wavevector * g * are labelled by the index @xmath36 and the eigenfrequencies are denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "explicit forms for the electric and magnetic fields of the guided modes are given in appendix [ app : guided - modes ] , as they are needed for the calculation of the matrix elements ( [ eq : matrix - elements ] ) .",
    "the guided modes of the effective waveguide in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]b depend on a wavevector * g * which can take any value in the 2d plane . however , photonic modes in the phc slab of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme]a have the form dictated by bloch - floquet theorem and they depend on a wavevector * k * which is usually restricted to the first brillouin zone of the 2d lattice : indeed , the effect of the dielectric modulation @xmath38 is to fold the guided modes of the effective waveguide to the first brillouin zone and to produce photonic bands and band gaps .",
    "we therefore write @xmath39 , where the bloch vector * k * lies in the first brillouin zone and * g * is a reciprocal lattice vector . as the basis states for the expansion ( [ eq : expansion ] ) of the magnetic field , we choose the guided modes @xmath40 of the effective waveguide given in appendix [ app : guided - modes ] .",
    "the guided - mode expansion of the magnetic field therefore reads@xcite    @xmath41    the basis set is orthonormal according to eq .",

    "( [ eq : matrix - elements ] ) can be calculated in a straightforward way from the field profiles of the guided modes : the resulting analytic expressions are somewhat lengthy and are given in appendix [ app : guided - elements ] .",
    "they depend on the inverse dielectric matrices    @xmath44    in the various layers .",
    "like in usual 2d plane wave calculations , a numerically convenient approach to calculate these matrix elements is to define the dielectric matrix    @xmath45    and to find @xmath46 by numerical matrix inversion as @xmath47 : this procedure is known to have much better convergence properties as a function of the number of plane waves,@xcite since the truncation rules for fourier series in the presence of discontinuous functions are better represented.@xcite if the photonic lattices in layers 13 have a center of inversion ( the same for all layers ) , the dielectric matrices @xmath48 , @xmath46 are symmetric in @xmath49 and @xmath13 turns out to be a real , symmetric matrix when the phases of the fields are chosen as in appendix [ app : guided - modes ] . in the most general case of a photonic lattice without a center of inversion ( like the triangular lattice with triangular holes investigated in this work ) , the matrix @xmath13 is complex hermitian .",
    "line and point defects can be treated by introducing a supercell in one or two directions , respectively , like in 2d plane - wave calculations .",
    "the formalism presented here refers to the most general case of an asymmetric phc slab .",
    "if the structure is symmetric under reflection by a horizontal mirror plane @xmath50 [ i.e. , if the upper and lower claddings have the same dielectric pattern and are made of the same dielectric materials , @xmath51 , the basis states as well as the photonic eigenmodes can be classified as even or odd with respect to the mirror plane .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the corresponding specular reflection operator and we shall refer to even ( odd ) states with respect to this operator as @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) modes .",
    "the simplest way to exploit this mirror symmetry is to solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : linear ] ) separately for @xmath53 and @xmath54 states by keeping only the appropriate solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tepol]),([eq : tmpol ] ) , as detailed in appendix [ app : symmetry ] .",
    "there we also discuss the issue of polarization mixing in the framework of the gme method : in general , a photonic mode of a phc slab is a superposition of te - polarized and tm - polarized basis states and all six components of the electric and magnetic fields are usually non - vanishing .",
    "another useful symmetry property holds when the bloch vector * k * lies along special symmetry directions , for which mirror reflection @xmath55 with respect to a vertical plane ( @xmath56 ) is a symmetry operation of the phc slab : in this case the eigenmodes can be classified as even or odd with respect to this mirror symmetry , i.e. , they have @xmath57 or @xmath58 respectively .",
    "vertical mirror symmetry can be exploited by transforming the matrix @xmath13 with a unitary transformation which decouples the blocks corresponding to @xmath59 states .",
    "when a photonic mode in the phc slab falls above the cladding light line ( or light lines , if the waveguide is asymmetric ) , it is coupled to leaky modes of the slab by the dielectric modulation and it becomes quasi - guided , i.e. , it is subject to intrinsic losses due to scattering out of the plane .",
    "the losses can be represented by an imaginary part of the frequency @xmath60 , which is related to the q - factor of a resonance by @xmath61 .    within the gme method ,",
    "the imaginary part of frequency can be calculated by time - dependent perturbation theory , like in fermi golden rule for quantum mechanics .",
    "the imaginary part of the squared frequency of a phc mode with bloch vector * k * , whose frequency lies above the cladding light lines ( or at least above one of them ) , is given by    @xmath62    where the matrix element between a guided and a leaky phc slab mode is given by    @xmath63    and @xmath64 is the 1d photonic density of states ( dos ) at fixed in - plane wave vector for radiation states that are outgoing in medium @xmath6 :    @xmath65    notice the sum over reciprocal lattice vectors and polarizations in eq .",

    "as the band labelled with 1 is almost unchanged on going from the circular to the triangular hole shape , also the intrinsic losses are quite similar between the two lattices . for higher lying bands , in particular for the band labelled with 2 , such similarity becomes less evident on approaching the light line , owing to the blue shift of modes for the triangular hole - based lattice and to the mixing with other modes which does not occur in the conventional lattice .",
