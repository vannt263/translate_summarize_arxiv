    "atomic nuclei are bound by the strong , short - range nucleon - nucleon interactions which impose the average nucleon - nucleon center - to - center distances comparable to the nucleon sizes . as a consequence , nuclear spatial density distributions , say @xmath8 , can be considered well localised in space , described / delimited by abstract auxiliary surfaces , here and below denoted with the symbol @xmath9 .",
    "these surfaces can be defined , for the sake of the following discussion , e.g.  by the relation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 can be thought of as the density in the nuclear centre .",
    "it then follows , as one of the consequences of the short - range of the nuclear interactions , that the nucleonic density falls rapidly to zero , and , by the same token , that the nuclear mean - field potentials acting on any single nucleon , rapidly vanish when the nucleons leave the nuclear interior ( i.e.  outside of @xmath9 ) .",
    "these arguments allow one to introduce auxiliary geometrical surfaces to facilitate discussing certain _ global _ nuclear properties  here : the geometrical forms of the nuclear matter distributions which , at this level of the discussion , can be thought of as a simple classical visualisation of the quantum probability density distributions . however , the problem acquires a much better defined quantum mechanical sense when the symmetry aspects can be discussed by combining the symmetry properties contained within a certain quantum formalism ( usually represented by a quantum hamiltonian approximating the properties of the physical system in question ) and the theory of the group representations .      in this article",
    "we will present the calculations which can be seen as an example of the applications of the nuclear microscopic many - body theories .",
    "our hamiltonian of choice will be a microscopic nuclear two - body hamiltonian with the interactions in the gogny form and the problem will be solved within the mean - field theory formalism . generally , the better the mean - field theory approximation , the more precise become the theoretical predictions of the experimental data and the more relevant the examining of the geometrical symmetries associated with nuclear surfaces , @xmath9 , the latter describing not only the symmetries of the spatial distribution of the nuclear _ densities _ but , more importantly , the symmetries of the _ spatial behaviour of the mean - field potential _ , say @xmath12 , the latter having a direct impact on the single particle levels . in particular , the single particle energy spectra respect the degeneracies which are _ in principle _ measurable straightforward mean - field calculations show that originally @xmath13-degenerate orbitals loose their degeneracy very quickly . as an example , in the case of the cited minute deformation , the energy difference between the extreme @xmath14-members of the @xmath15 orbital , @xmath16 approaches 2 mev or more , an estimate which clarifies the next - to - impossibility of discovering the presence of nuclear symmetries through the single - nucleon degeneracy criteria .",
    "] and equal to the dimensions of the irreducible representations of @xmath17 . in the case of the tetrahedral symmetry",
    "these degeneracies are equal either 4 or 2 independently of the size of the related mass multiple moment @xmath18 .    to be able to briefly discuss the symmetry - related physics - problems when aiming at the discovery of the point - group symmetries of the compact nuclear systems , let us consider a point - group @xmath17 with the elements @xmath19 under action of which the considered surface @xmath9 happens to be invariant .",
    "the invariance mentioned implies the commutation - relations in the form @xmath20=0,\\;\\forall\\,k , $ ] where the operators @xmath21 form a representation of the group @xmath17 .",
    "when this happens , the group @xmath17 turns into a symmetry group of the hamiltonian  and , as a consequence  within the mean - field approximation , also into the symmetry group of the considered nuclear system .",
    "this offers the possibility of predicting some measurable consequences since the implied single particle wave functions transform as irreducible representations of the group in question and thus the electromagnetic selection rules can be _ in principle _ derived .",
    "such an approach is , however , not straightforward at all because of the mathematical complications which involve constructions of the determinant - type many - body wave functions and the projection on the irreducible representations of the studied symmetry groups in the appropriately constructed many - body spaces .    in the next section we summarise briefly an alternative quantum approach which does not involve the just mentioned mathematical complications .",
    "our strategy followed in the present article will be to profit from the simplicity of these alternative considerations and approach the physical manifestations of the symmetry issue on the semi - quantitative level .",
    "whereas the above arguments suggest a research way straightforward to follow , in practice the corresponding analysis is complicated by the necessity of analysing experimentally the branching ratios of very specific transitions whose big number is usually not known at the present time rotational patterns ... except that in contrast to all other nuclei , the corresponding levels are _ not _ connected by the usually strong @xmath22-transitions  and this because the underlying quadruple moments vanish as well as the implied collective reduced transition probabilities . ] . therefore demonstrating the presence of non - trivial geometrical symmetries in nuclei",
    "requires proposing certain specifically designed experiments most likely on the step - by - step basis and thus the study of the discussed symmetry problem becomes a lengthy , multi - step process .",
    "it is then of importance to calculate beforehand the leading features of the nuclear spectra in order to focus the possible experimental investigation on the verification of the predicted structures such as the characteristic sequences of the low - lying energy levels which can be considered characteristic for the examined symmetry ( see below ) and verify the reduced transition probabilities and branching ratios resulting from the symmetry considerations .",
    "analogues of the collectively rotating tetrahedral - symmetric nuclei are known to exist in nature , in the domain of molecular physics , where the tetrahedral symmetry molecules have been studied for a long time  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding formalism related to the group - theory aspects uses the fact that the wave - functions , solutions of the tetrahedral - symmetric quantum rotor hamiltonian of the system composed of an even number of fermions , must belong to one of the five irreducible representations of the @xmath23-group .",
    "since these aspects are relatively seldom discussed in the nuclear physics literature let us introduce a few underlying notions which will allow appreciating the simplicity of the symmetry discussions when addressing the rotational properties ; actually we will limit ourselves to using the conclusions of such a formulation known from the other authors ( see below ) .",
    "the so - called ` usual ' case of the nuclear quantum rotor is obtained through quantising the classical tri - axial top energy expression in which case the classical angular momenta , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 of a rotating uniform tri - axial ellipsoid are replaced by the corresponding operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively : @xmath30 where the adjustable constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sometimes called ` effective moments of inertia ' . to be able to construct a quantum rotor hamiltonian generalised to higher orders in terms of the angular momentum operators it is convenient to introduce spherical - tensor operator - basis in the form @xmath34 with the help of which any operator constructed out of powers of the angular momentum can be obtained .",
    "the notation above employing the symbol `` @xmath35 '' refers to the usual clebsch - gordan coupling and @xmath36 according to standard notation in terms of spherical tensors ; each of the corresponding tensors appears as an @xmath37-order polynomial in terms of @xmath38 .",
    "for instance for the so - called generalised quantum rotor hamiltonian ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) we find , using somewhat schematic notation , the following general form @xmath39             \\big\\ } ,                                                                   \\label{eqn.03}\\ ] ] where the adjustable constants @xmath40 can be constructed in such a way that the operator on the left hand side above is hermitian .",
    "it is then straightforward to verify with the help of the usual clebsch - gordan coupling techniques that the lowest - order tetrahedral - symmetry quantum - rotor hamiltonian takes the form @xmath41}_{\\displaystyle\\hat{h}_{{\\rm t}_d}(3 ) }        =        \\hat{h}_{\\rm sph.}(2 ) + \\hat{h}_{{\\rm t}_d}(3 ) ,                                                                   \\label{eqn.04}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are quadratic and third order operators constructed out of components of @xmath38 , of the second and third ranks , respectively .",
    "the above object is invariant under the symmetry operations of the @xmath44 group since the first term above is a scalar under the rotation group ( and thus invariant under any point - group operations ) whereas the second term is invariant specifically under the symmetry operations of the @xmath44-group .",
    "the parameters of such an hamiltonian can be adjusted to simulate the nuclear rotational properties , cf .",
    "@xcite for certain mathematical specificities of the problem .",
    "the matrix representations of the hamiltonian in ( [ eqn.04 ] ) can be straightforwardly obtained within the basis of the wigner functions @xmath45 and the corresponding solutions constructed numerically together with their classification in terms of the five irreducible representations , the scalar ones , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as well as @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "however even without performing such calculations explicitly one may expect that for the doubly - magic tetrahedral - symmetry even - even nuclei the states belonging to the totally - symmetric representation @xmath46 lie low in the energy scale and it becomes of a primary interest to identify the spins and parities of such states on the basis of the group - theoretical approach  on the one - hand side  and to calculate the energies of such states microscopically using our mean - field approach , on the other .",
    "for the latter - the rest of this article will be devoted to a description of the corresponding results whereas the solution of the former problem is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite , in particular the discussion summarising the relevant considerations in the appendix a thereof ) .",
    "the @xmath46-representation contains in its low - spin part the sequence of states with the following spin - parity combinations : @xmath51 as it is discussed in more detail below , in all the three doubly - magic tetrahedral - symmetry nuclei , those and only those states are predicted to form the yrast line ( alternatively , to lie close to the yrast states ) whereas all other states appear higher in the energy scale .",
    "this property underlies once again  somewhat paradoxically , since at the level of the two - body formulation of the nuclear hamiltonian there is formally no place for the point - group symmetry concepts  the importance of the concepts of the geometrical symmetries .",
    "the latter are the fundamental tool in the studies of molecular systems and yet their importance can be seen to extend to the realm of the microscopic _ nuclear _ many - body approaches based on the strong interactions .",
    "our results in the form of the energy - vs .- spin diagrams below , in comparison to the sequence in ( [ eqn.05 ] ) , provide an illustration of the above observation .    at the same time",
    "these results suggest that investing in the experimental studies of the nuclei in question is very timely , especially from the point of view of the examining of their octupole properties : the reduced @xmath52 transitions and , if the absolute values turn out to be too difficult to obtain , in terms of the corresponding relative transition probabilities and branching ratios .",
    "the present article focuses on this type of the calculations which may facilitate discovering of one of those exotic symmetries  the tetrahedral one , see e.g.  ref.@xcite and references therein . with the help of group theory",
    ", one can deduce what kind of spin - parity combinations of the nuclear energy levels should be expected e.g.  at and near the yrast line , the mathematical arguments used in the nuclear context fully analogous to the ones known from molecular physics . however , in order to obtain the possibly reliable knowledge of the characteristic features of the spectra and of the transition probabilities , the method used should preferably be based on a realistic microscopic approach , possibly already tested in the past in a different context .",
    "we have recently analysed theoretically the quantum spectra of the tetrahedrally deformed nuclei with doubly - closed tetrahedral - shell configurations  @xcite , where both the spherical and inversion symmetries are broken and the efficient quantum number projection method from the most general mean - field states , ref.@xcite , becomes important .",
    "it has been confirmed that the calculated low - lying states compose a collective band built out of states with some specific spin - parity combinations , which is expected by the group theory considerations .",
    "moreover , when the tetrahedral deformation increases , the character of the yrast sequence changes from the approximately linear energy - vs .- spin dependence to the parabolic one , just like in the case of the increasing quadrupole deformation .    in our previous study  @xcite ,",
    "a schematic separable - type interaction has been used , employing among others a realistic woods - saxon mean - field potential . in this article",
    "we present the results obtained using hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method with the gogny interactions  @xcite .",
    "we focus the discussion on the realistic calculations with the tetrahedral - symmetry solutions .",
    "some preliminary results were published in ref.@xcite .",
    "we believe that our microscopic results discussed below can be seen as realistic many - body theory predictions of the structure of the low - lying spectra in the three nuclei illustrated here which coincide structurally with the spectra predicted for the tetrahedral - symmetry rotors .",
    "we also believe that it is very much worthwhile to attempt the experimental identification of the presence of such states in the nuclei which can be reached under the present day experimental conditions - taking into account , as indicated earlier , that the collective @xmath53 and @xmath22 transitions are most likely non - existing ( negligibly small ) under the presence of the exact tetrahedral symmetry and thus the only collective transition will be of the octupole nature , as also discussed in some more detail below .",

    "the coulomb interaction is accurately approximated by the eight gaussian terms and treated in the same way as the central interaction .",

    "this remark has a couple of consequences whose consideration may be instructive .",
    "firstly , if the considered tetrahedral configurations are indeed ground - state ones the generally difficult measurements of the reduced transition probabilities in question needed for further study of the discussed phenomena may turn out to be slightly easier .",
    "secondly , the large @xmath52 values come in this case principally from ` pure ' octupole contributions  as opposed to the situation in which octupole _ and _ quadrupole deformations coexist and it becomes of particular interest to examine the possible effects of all the @xmath67 moments to the final reduced transition probabilities . with this goal in mind it becomes instructive to test the total energy behaviour in function of the other octupole - deformation parameters .",
    "we have calculated the hfb as well as the projected energies in function of these components treated as constraints for @xmath0zr .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig.04 ] .",
    "they are obtained by using the smaller model space with @xmath958 ( for the sake of completeness , the result for the tetrahedral deformation @xmath105 , which is the same as fig.[fig.03 ] , is also included ) .    in order to be able to extract the sought information in a way which resembles the one - axis projection cuts like those presented so far we have imposed a single active - constraint condition e.g. , for calculating the hfb energy as a function of @xmath167 , the components @xmath168 with @xmath169 are constraint to be zero and then the angular - momentum projection is applied .",
    "for all the four constraints studied in the case of @xmath0zr , the hfb energy gain relative to the spherical configuration is similar , but the largest one corresponds to the tetrahedral deformation .",
    "the latter defines a real local hfb minimum at @xmath170 which turns out to be the absolute one , according to our calculations .",
    "compared with this minimum energy , the lowest energies for other @xmath171 , @xmath167 and @xmath172 constraints are 272 , 318 and 354 kev higher , respectively .",
    "we may associate this feature with the presence of the four - fold degeneracies of the single - nucleon levels at the tetrahedral - symmetric shapes as implied by the presence of the four - dimensional irreducible representations of the tetrahedral group  what results in stronger ( tetrahedral ) shell - effects and stronger chances to generate the bigger level spacings .",
    "it may be instructive to discuss a possible impact of the quadrupole deformation developing along the paths corresponding to the @xmath173 constraints discussed above .",
    "as for the tetrahedral deformation , @xmath105 , the quadrupole deformation is always vanishing thus the tetrahedral symmetry is preserved along the corresponding static minimum path . for the @xmath171 constraint ,",
    "only @xmath64 is non - vanishing and gradually increases up to about 0.045 at the largest value of constraint in fig.[fig.04 ] .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath167 constraint , both @xmath64 and @xmath174 gradually increase up to about 0.05 and 0.035 , respectively ; for the @xmath172 constraint , only @xmath64 gradually decreases down to about @xmath175 .",
    "thus , one can safely say that the effect of the static quadrupole deformation is minor .    the analogous results for the angular - momentum projected energies are similar among themselves .",
    "the obtained lowering of the energy due to projection is very significant : indeed , the projected nuclear energies are lowered by about 10  mev _ for each _ of the four deformations as illustrated in fig.[fig.04 ] . among the lowest projected energies along the paths corresponding to the four constraints , those for the @xmath171 and @xmath167 constraints coincide within 1 kev and the others are 673 and 901 kev higher , respectively , for the @xmath105 and @xmath172 constraints .",
    "we conclude that in the nucleus studied _ all the octupole deformation components are comparably important _ according to our projected gogny - hfb calculations .    the above presented results for the hfb local minima can be compared with those in refs .",

    "<S> we also find out that , for all the nuclei studied , the correlation energy obtained after the angular momentum projection is very large for the tetrahedral deformation as well as other octupole deformations . </S>",
    "<S> the lowering of the energies of the resulting configurations is considerable , i.e.  by about 10 mev or even more , once again confirming the significance of the angular - momentum projections techniques in the mean - field nuclear structure calculations . </S>"
