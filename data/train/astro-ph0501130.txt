    "cosmological inflation  @xcite is a central component of the present theoretical picture of cosmology .",
    "inflation not only directly addresses and solves fundamental weaknesses of the older big bang picture  the flatness and horizon problems  it also provides an elegant mechanism for the creation of primordial fluctuations  @xcite , essential for explaining the observed structure of the present - day universe . as the universe inflates , microscopic quantum scales are stretched to macroscopic cosmological scales .",
    "quantum vacuum fluctuations provide the initial seeds that are amplified by gravitational instability , leading to the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "the primordial fluctuations associated with inflation are , primarily , of a very simple type . in `` standard '' inflationary models ,",
    "they arise from the fluctuations of an effectively free scalar field and are hence gaussian random fields , completely characterized by two - point statistics , such as the power spectrum . the basic task , then , is to determine the scalar and tensor perturbations ( vector perturbations being naturally suppressed ) in terms of the associated power spectra .",
    "power spectra from standard inflation models are conveniently parameterized by a spectral index and its ( weak ) variation with scale  the `` running '' of the spectral index .",
    "in addition , inflation couples the generation of scalar and tensor fluctuations ; if both are independently measured , `` compatibility '' relations characteristic of inflation can be put to observational test .",
    "it should be noted that complicated inflationary models can be constructed to produce baroque `` designer '' power spectra .",
    "present observations do not require building such models .",
    "observational constraints on the primordial power spectra arise from measurements of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , sensitive to both scalar and tensor modes , and from measurements of the density power spectrum in surveys of the large - scale mass distribution in the universe .",
    "ground and satellite - based observations of the cmbr anisotropy have yielded results very consistent with the essential adiabatic and gaussian nature of inflationary perturbations , with a value of the scalar spectral index very close to unity  @xcite .",
    "the tensor fluctuations are expected to be much lower in amplitude and have not yet been observed .",
    "scalar perturbations seed structure formation and hence can be measured by observing the large - scale distribution of galaxies and neutral hydrogen , as in ongoing redshift surveys  @xcite and ly@xmath1 observations  @xcite .",
    "this second set of independent measurements provides information on smaller scales than the cmbr , yet there is an overlap region where both measurements have been shown to be consistent ( fig .",
    "[ obsfig ] ) .",
    "the observed power spectrum is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the primordial power spectrum and @xmath4 is the transfer function for radiation or matter as appropriate .     taken from tegmark et al .",
    "@xcite ( with permission ) .",
    "this particular figure assumes a flat scalar scale - invariant model with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and a bias , @xmath9 for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies . the solid line is the theoretical curve . ]    as measurements continue to improve , tests of the inflationary paradigm and specific inflationary models will become more stringent , especially if accurate measurements of the running of the spectral index are performed and tensor perturbations are observed . in addition , an inverse analysis of the observational data may then be attempted , in an effort to directly measure the inflationary `` equation of state ''  @xcite . in keeping with the remarkable improvement of observational capabilities ,",
    "the quality of theoretical predictions has necessarily to be addressed .",
    "the central theme of this paper is to quantify and improve the quality of theoretical predictions .",
    "scalar and tensor power spectra for particular inflation models can be calculated either by direct numerical methods or by employing analytic or semi - analytic approximations such as the slow - roll approach  @xcite or uniform approximations  @xcite . for individual models",
    ", the numerical approach may well be preferable , but powerful approximations have their own advantages .",
    "they provide intuition and understanding applicable to entire classes of models .",
    "provided tight error controls can be met , they are much faster than a mode - by - mode numerical integration for obtaining the power spectrum . also , both numerical and approximate strategies can be melded together by first obtaining a set of approximate results over a wide range of parameters and then spot - checking numerically .",
    "it is our view that both strategies should be applied and compared against each other as they have differing error modes .",
    "finally , it should be kept in mind that the ultimate accuracy with which the primordial fluctuations must be computed is limited by how accurately the radiation and matter transfer functions are known , as well as by the errors associated with observations . at present",
    ", the transfer functions can be computed to about @xmath0 accuracy  @xcite , sufficient for dealing with next - generation observations .",
    "we will use this value as a relative figure of merit when discussing errors below .",
    "it should be noted that the accuracy requirements for the tensor or gravitational wave component are not as stringent as for the scalar component ; the expected signal is at large length scales , where cosmic variance becomes unavoidable .",
    "finally , measurements of the radiation and matter power spectrum at higher values of @xmath10 face issues such as the rapid fall - off of the primary signal , secondary point - source contamination , foreground subtraction ( for the cmbr ) , galaxy bias , systematic errors , effects from baryons  @xcite and neutrinos @xcite , and limited accuracy in theoretical computation of the present nonlinear power spectrum  @xcite for the matter distribution .",
    "in this paper we focus on the perturbation spectrum for single - field inflationary models .",
    "we implement a direct numerical approach as well as the slow - roll and uniform approximations , with the aim of establishing control over the errors associated with each method and understanding their associated advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the main technical advances are a robust and numerically efficient strategy for the mode - by - mode integration , simple and useful error estimates for the uniform approximation , and a simple improvement strategy for power spectra amplitudes for the uniform approximation at leading order .",
    "we are able to show that the improved leading order uniform approximation leads to very good accuracy for the spectral indices and their running , as well as for the amplitudes of the power spectra and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations .",
    "for the most part , the accuracy of the results obtained is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "the method of uniform approximation employed in this paper has been presented in refs .",
    "this method is a `` uniformization '' of the well - known wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) or liouville - green ( lg ) approximation  @xcite in the presence of transition points .",
    "the uniform approximation began with the work of langer  @xcite and others , and was followed by the notable contributions of olver  @xcite which we rely on for our analysis below .",
    "while this line of investigation rested on the analysis of ordinary differential equations , equivalent asymptotic results based on an integral representation were given by chester , friedman , and ursell  @xcite .",
    "the uniform approximation has proven very useful in many applications , e.g. , chemical physics  @xcite , the semiclassical limit in quantum mechanics  @xcite , and the quantum - classical transition in quantum cosmology  @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the key advantages of the olver uniform approximation are that it does away with wkb - like matching conditions  @xcite ( such a procedure fails to indicate the error of the approximation ) , has controlled error bounds over the entire domain of interest , is systematically improvable , and allows analytic simplifications in special cases of physical interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ background ] provides the necessary background regarding the calculation of the primordial power spectra and spectral indices for single field inflation models . in section [ uniapproximation ] the results from the uniform approximation in leading order",
    "are given , while in section [ slowroll ] the essential equations for the slow - roll approximation are summarized . in section [ numerics ]",
    "we give a detailed description of the numerical determination of the primordial power spectra and spectral indices by solving the mode - equations numerically , in the uniform approximation , and in the slow - roll approximation .",
    "we investigate three different examples in section [ examples ] and conclude with a discussion of our results in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the generation of perturbations during inflation is due to the amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations by the dynamics of the background spacetime . in order to calculate the perturbation spectra for these quantum vacuum fluctuations three steps",
    "are necessary : the dynamics of the background spacetime must be determined , the mode equations for the scalar and tensor perturbations must be solved , and finally , the power spectra themselves must be calculated as functions of wave - number @xmath10 .",
    "we will briefly outline these three steps in the following ; for detailed derivations the reader is refered to the literature  @xcite .      for single - field inflationary models ,",
    "i.e. , when inflation is driven by a single homogeneous scalar field , the dynamical equation for the inflaton field @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 the dots denote derivatives with respect to physical time  @xmath13 .",
    "the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the scale factor , is given by the friedmann equation @xmath16.\\ ] ] equivalently , by taking the derivative of @xmath17 with respect to time and inserting the equation of motion ( [ eomphi ] ) for @xmath11 we can write @xmath18 here and in the following we have set @xmath19 .",
    "( [ eomphi ] ) and ( [ hsq ] ) or ( [ hdot ] ) determine the evolution of the inflaton field completely .",
    "in addition , it is useful to calculate the number of expansion e - folds via @xmath20 monitoring the number of e - folds for which inflation lasts allows us to select observationally relevant inflationary models and their parameters .",
    "finally , the conformal time @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 as explained later , the uniform approximation is expressed naturally in terms of the conformal time .",
    "once the background equations are solved we can proceed to the next step , the evaluation of the scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "the modern understanding of fluctuations generated by inflation is based on the gauge - invariant treatment of linearized fluctuations in the metric and field quantities  @xcite .",
    "a particularly convenient quantity for characterizing the perturbations is the intrinsic curvature perturbation of the comoving hypersurfaces  @xcite , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a gauge - invariant scalar perturbation  @xcite , and @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath26 is the sound speed and @xmath27 is the curvature of spatial sections .",
    "for single - field inflationary models , this simplifies to @xmath28 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 satisfies the dynamical equation @xmath29 where primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time and @xmath30 is the spatial laplacian in comoving coordinates .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath31 is approximately constant in the long wavelength limit @xmath32 .",
    "this is true during the inflationary phase as well as during the post - reheating era .",
    "moreover , the einstein equations can be used to connect the gravitational potential @xmath33 and @xmath31 so that a computation of the power spectrum of @xmath31 provides all the information needed ( aside from the transfer functions ) to extract the temperature anisotropy of the cmbr .",
    "details of this procedure can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "we will describe how to obtain approximate solutions for the scalar and tensor power spectra and the spectral indices and their running , assuming that the evolution of the background quantities is known .",
    "in two recent papers  @xcite we have implemented an approach based on the uniform approximation ( for a detailed description of the approximation , see ref .",
