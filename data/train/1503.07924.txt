    "in our recent paper @xcite we studied the proton spin structure in leading order of the covariant approach assuming the gluon contribution to the proton spin can be neglected .",
    "however the question of the real role of gluons in generating the proton spin is still open .",
    "actually some recent data obtained at rhic and their analyses @xcite can suggest a positive gluon contribution to the proton spin .",
    "the main aim of the present letter is to extend discussion from our previous study to the case of nonzero gluon contribution .",
    "we will show what constraint on the gluon contribution follows from the covariant approach .",
    "[ spin ] is devoted to a discussion about some general aspects of particle spin and its scale dependence .",
    "two different examples are considered , electron and quark .",
    "the electron spin structure is also an interesting topic , see the recent study @xcite and the previous papers @xcite .",
    "particularly important questions concern the spin of quarks inside the nucleon . in sec .",
    "[ proton ] the discussion about the proton spin , which is generated by the interplay of angular moments of quarks and gluons , continues in the context of recent experimental data .    in present calculations we use , as before , the rest frame of the composite system as a starting reference frame .",
    "this frame is suitable for the consistent composition of spins and oams of the constituents in the representation of spinor spherical harmonics .",
    "the resulting state serves as an input for construction of the covariant quantities , like the spin vector or the spin structure functions @xcite .",
    "in general , description of real interacting particles can be related to their bare or dressed form . in our present discussion",
    "we address the general questions :    \\a ) how much do the virtual particles surrounding bare particle contribute to the spin of corresponding real , dressed particle ?",
    "\\b ) how much do the virtual particles mediating bond of the constituents of a composite particle contribute to its spin ?    in quantum mechanic",
    "the total angular momentum ( am ) of any particle including composite ones is given by the sum of the orbital am ( oam ) and spin , @xmath0 the corresponding quantum numbers are discrete sets of integers or half - integers and in the relativistic case only total am conserves , so only @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be the good quantum numbers .",
    "we will illustrate the problem with two different examples , electron and quark .",
    "the electron , as a dirac particle , in its rest frame has am defined by its spin , @xmath3 .",
    "this value is the same for the dressed electron ( as proved experimentally ) and for the bare one ( as defined by the qed lagrangian ) .",
    "the dressed electron is a bare electron surrounded by the virtual cloud of @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs , as symbolically sketched in fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] for different scales represented by the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "so the renormalization as a continuous change of the scale should not change the am represented by the discrete numbers , @xmath7 .",
    "but what about the projections @xmath8 @xmath9 ?",
    "can the contribution of virtual cloud @xmath10 differ from zero and how much ?  in this letter we present a semiclassical estimate of the vector @xmath11 .",
    "the electromagnetic field , or its @xmath4-quanta , are according to maxwell equations created by the electric current .",

    "the functions @xmath23  are usual spherical harmonics .",
    "the radial functions in the case of free electron read:@xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26  are bessel functions of the first kind , otherwise ( e.g. for electron in the hydrogen atom ) the radial functions differ according to an external field .",
    "however , it is important that the information about the electron am is completely absorbed in the angular terms and does not depend on the radial functions .",
    "the states @xmath27 are eigenstates of the total am and have been discussed before @xcite in momentum representation , while in the present note we deal with their coordinate representation corresponding to the rest frame of an composite system .",
    "the corresponding current reads@xmath28 and one can check that@xmath29 where@xmath30 a few examples of @xmath31  are given in table [ tb1 ] , where one can observe the following .",

    "so , there is no reason to expect any correlation between electron polarization and polarization of the electromagnetic field generated by this current , or equivalently polarization of the statistical set of emitted and reabsorbed @xmath4 . in other words",
    "the average polarization of virtual cloud of @xmath4 and consequently also @xmath5 pairs should be zero .",
    "the am of the electromagnetic field is given by the relation@xmath49 where @xmath50 are the corresponding intensities of electric and magnetic field .",
    "due to the symmetry of current ( [ br4 ] ) that generates these fields , the corresponding am satisfies@xmath51 the proof is given in appendix .",
    "this relation follows only from the angular terms in the wave function ( [ rs1 ] ) and does not depend on the radial ones .",
    "in other words , the relation ( [ br5 ] ) holds not only for a free electron , but also for an electron bound in the hydrogen atom .",
    "the result represents a mean value , which is not influenced by the fluctuations generated by single @xmath4 .",
    "so , this calculation suggests the integral am of the cloud of virtual @xmath4 is zero despite the fact that am of its source , the electron in a state ( [ rs1 ] ) , is not zero . while the free electron emits and reabsorbs virtual photons by itself , the electron bounded in hydrogen atom in addition exchanges ( emits and absorbs ) virtual photons with the proton .",
    "since the am of the electromagnetic field generated by the proton is zero as well , the total am of hydrogen will be given only by ams of the electron and proton , without contribution of the electromagnetic field generated by both the particles .",
    "similar arguments can be relevant also for atoms in general and perhaps for the nucleons bound in a nucleus .",
    "this would suggest the virtual particles mediating the binding of nucleons also do not contribute to the resulting spin of nucleus , which must be always integer or half - integer .",
    "our approach ( a ) has a common basis with the qed calculation ( b ) suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , since both the approaches follow from the general qed equations ( 1),(6 ) and ( 7 ) in the last reference .",
    "despite that , there are some differences between them , the most apparent are as follows .",
    "\\(a ) the approach is semiclassical only and the ams are directly related to the electron wavefunction @xmath52 and the classical electromagnetic field @xmath53 generated by the electric current @xmath54 .",
    "the preferred reference frame is the frame defined by the spinor spherical harmonics ( [ rs1 ] ) or the rest frame of the defined composite system ( e.g. atom ) .",
    "this simplified treatment allows us to obtain the relation ( [ br5 ] ) but without a decomposition into the spin and oam parts .",
    "\\(b ) the study is focused on the fundamental problem of the am decomposition in quantum field theory and explicit calculation is performed for the qed .",
    "the preferred reference frame is the infinite momentum frame .",
    "the light - front formalism is adopted to achieve a compatibility with the standard formulation of the parton model .",
    "the result on the total boson ( photon ) am seems be also rather small , @xmath55    so both the approaches , adopting rather different formalism and correspondingly also some different assumptions , are not contradictory . from a phenomenological point of view , they are complementary .",
    "the situation with quarks inside a nucleon is more complicated .",
    "the quark at different scales is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] ( in which the bare electron surrounded by virtual cloud of @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs is now replaced by the bare quark with a cloud of virtual @xmath56  and @xmath57 @xmath58  pairs ) .",
    "the terminology is as follows :    \\i ) the bare quark can be identified with the current quark , which can be described by the distribution functions @xmath59 defined in the quark - parton model .",
    "they are related to the sets of quarks and antiquarks in the figure for @xmath60    \\ii ) the constituent quark can be identified with the dressed quark at a low @xmath6 scale .",
    "\\iii ) the valence quark can be identified with the set of quarks , from which the cloud of virtual @xmath57 pairs and gluons is separated off . in the figure",
    "the valence quarks are represented by the central spots . strictly speaking , depending on the scale , valence and sea quarks",
    "may not be clearly distinguishable . in a short time interval @xmath61 ,",
    "a quark from the virtual @xmath57 pair is indistinguishable from the source , valence quark , see fig .",
    "[ fgr2 ] .",
    "however , the usual definition in terms of the quark - parton model distributions @xmath62 is unambiguous . for quarks the parameter @xmath6 represents the renormalization scale , but also the dis parameter ( @xmath63 photon four - momentum square ) or equivalently a scale of the space - time domain inside which the photon absorption takes place @xcite .",
    "now , we can put the question b ) for the quarks bound inside the proton : how much the field of virtual gluons generated by the valence quarks and the sea of virtual @xmath57 pairs created by the gluons contribute to the proton spin ?",
    "this question is being studied in the experiments , which measure contribution of the gluons and sea quarks to the proton spin .",
    "available data from the experiments compass @xcite and hermes @xcite suggest rather small gluon contribution , in fact the data are consistent with zero within statistical errors .",
    "the very recent results of the rhic experiments  @xcite suggest a positive gluon contribution which , however still can not fully compensate for a small quark contribution to the proton spin .",
    "these results can be interpreted in the framework of covariant approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the paper we studied the relativistic interplay between the quark spins and oams , which collectively contribute to the proton spin .  the simplest scenario assuming    \\1 ) the quarks are in the state @xmath64 see eq . 113@xcite ,",
    "\\2 ) mass of quarks can be neglected , @xmath65",
    "\\3 ) there is no gluon contribution , i.e. proton spin @xmath66 is generated only by the am of quarks , see eq .",
    "109@xcite    gave a prediction for the contribution of the quark spins in dis region , @xmath67 while the missing  part of the proton spin is fully compensated by the quark oam .",
    "this prediction fits the data @xcite surprisingly well .",
    "however , in a more general case , if only condition 1 ) is assumed , then am of each quark consists of the spin and oam part@xmath68 where @xmath69 , see eqs .",
    "( 17 ) , ( 22 ) in ref .",
    "it is very important result , which easily follows from the algebra of spinor spherical harmonics representing the solutions of dirac equation",
    ". the ratio @xmath70 here plays a crucial role , since it controls a `` contraction '' of the spin component , which is compensated by the oam .",
    "it is a quantum mechanical effect of relativistic kinematics .",
    "mathematically , a small @xmath71 means the lower component of dirac spinor is important .",
    "this is also the case in @xcite , where with some distinction of formalism and paradigm the authors come to similar results on the spin of quark bound in the proton .",
    "the effect is strongly correlated with the transversal motion of quarks inside the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the relations ( [ br8z ] ) imply that the total am of a composite system of quarks with @xmath72 reads @xmath73 where the ratio of the total spin @xmath74 and oam @xmath75 is the same as for the one - quark states above : @xmath76 further , if the proton spin consists of the quark and gluon contributions , one can write@xmath77 with the use of eqs.([br8])-([br10 ] ) one gets @xmath78 which after replacing @xmath79 gives@xmath80 in a higher approximation , if we admit an admixture of the quark states with @xmath81 the relation is modified as@xmath82",
    "the relation ( [ br14 ] ) means the quark spin content  depends on two parameters , the gluon contribution @xmath83  and the quark effective mass ratio @xmath71 , which affects proportion of the quark oam .",
    "it follows from the algebra of spinor spherical harmonics and from general rules of am composition in the system of quarks and gluons with the total spin @xmath66 .",
    "the dependence is demonstrated in fig .",

    "the dotted , full and dashed lines correspond to @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively.,width=302 ]    one can observe :    \\a ) @xmath87 corresponds to @xmath88 for any @xmath89 . a special case @xmath90 and @xmath91 implies @xmath92 .",
    "\\b ) @xmath93 then the sign of @xmath83 depends on @xmath94 apparently , @xmath95 would imply @xmath96    in this way the compass and hermes data @xcite giving @xmath97 can be compatible also with a positive gluon contribution @xmath83 suggested by the recent data on rhic .",
    "note that positive @xmath83  correlates with a positive quark effective mass ratio @xmath71 .",
    "can we somehow estimate this parameter ? in the proton rest frame a quark has momentum @xmath98 and there are independent ways to estimate it , for example :    \\1 ) if we take proton diameter  @xmath99fm , then the uncertainty relation gives for the corresponding momentum roughly @xmath100mev .",
    "\\2 ) the analysis @xcite of the data on the azimuthal asymmetry in semi - inclusive dis suggest @xmath101mev .",
    "\\3 ) the statistical approaches @xcite suggests @xmath102mev and a similar value was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for valence quarks , see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , if one suppose the quark effective mass of the order mev , then the parameter @xmath103 , which gives a similar upper limit on the gluon contribution , @xmath104 .  finally , the spin contribution of the sea quarks is known to be small or compatible with zero @xcite . this can confirm the expectation that the sea quark contribution correlates with the gluon contribution .    in the present approach the quark effective mass ratio @xmath71 and the gluon am contribution @xmath83 are free , phenomenological parameters constrained by the relation ( [ br14 ] ) .",
    "at the same time corresponding scale - dependent parameters , for example the quark effective masses , are ( at least in principle ) calculable in qcd @xcite .",
    "however , due to nonperturbative aspect of related task , the real calculation can be extremely difficult .",
    "that is why our approach based on the covariant quark - parton model can be a useful supplement to the exact but more complicated theory of the nucleon spin structure based on pure qcd .    to conclude , interpretation of the available sets of experimental data in framework of the covariant approach suggests an important role of the quark oam for the creation of the proton spin on the scale @xmath6 defined by the data .",
    "the data of experiments compass and hermes on the quark and gluon contribution to the proton spin are fully compatible with our approach . at the same time , a limited positive gluon contribution does not contradict the covariant approach .",
    "however , the precise data on @xmath83 are still missing , so the existing experimental data do not disprove the hypothesis @xmath105 based on the analogy with am of virtual photons given by eq .",
