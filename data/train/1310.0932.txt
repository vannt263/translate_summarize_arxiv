    "in recent years , much attention has been devoted to the study of closed - loop control systems interconnected by a digital channel where the information transmission is triggered by specific event - triggered conditions .",
    "the interest in this class of control systems is motivated by the increased computational capability required by control and estimation algorithms in addition to the presence of emerging control applications wherein the actuators of a control system may be non - colocated with the sensing devices ( e.g , drilling systems , remote handling systems ) so that the plant output is collected by the controller via a digital channel which may have some stringent bandwidth requirement .",
    "this class of systems is a very specific subclass of the much more general topic of networked control systems ( see , e.g. , the recent surveys @xcite and references therein ) . indeed , while in general networked control systems , various subcomponents are spread over a wide territory or are technologically built in such a way that several subcomponents of the control system communicate over shared and low capacity digital channels , the study of event - triggered and self - triggered systems @xcite led to a significant amount of research results where the core problem under consideration is that of two nodes ( the sensing node and the actuating one ) communicating through a ( low capacity ) digital channel where the transmission policy is determined based on suitable lyapunov - like conditions involving some ( more or less coarse ) measurement of the plant state .     a natural way to represent and suitably write the dynamics of this specific two - nodes configuration is to use the hybrid systems notation , namely a state - space description wherein the state flows according to some continuous - time rules and , at some specific times , called jump times , it jumps following some discrete - time jump rule .",
    "a framework for the representation of hybrid systems that has been recently proposed in @xcite allows for a quite natural description of these phenomena with useful lyapunov like results that have been proven to apply to large classes of systems described using this framework ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the survey @xcite ) .",
    "this framework was used in connection with networked control systems in @xcite , and recently in @xcite , where lyapunov tools are used to model iss properties of networked control systems and the mati ( maximum allowable transfer interval ) , to preserve asymptotic stability .    here",
    ", we consider a closed - loop system that consists of a linear controller driving a linear plant to guarantee closed - loop asymptotic stability , as shown in figure  [ fig : sl ] , and we break the continuity of the transmission of the measured plant output @xmath0 to the controller input @xmath1 by introducing the _ transmission - lazy sensors _ , devices which measure the output @xmath0 and decide whether or not sending this measurement to the controller input @xmath1 through a transmission channel , based on non - periodic lyapunov - based policies .",
    "we call these sensors `` transmission - lazy '' to resemble the fact that their goal is to avoid transmitting too often , so as to keep the digital channel load small enough .",
    "we suppose that each sensor is able to perform some computation on the measured plant output and , possibly , on extra available signals .",
    "the ideal scenario where this approach is relevant corresponds to cases where due to some technological constraint , there is a transmission line between a location where all the sensors are installed and a second location where the actuators are placed with a transmission channel inbetween ( see figure  [ fig : sl ] ) .     and",
    "transmission - lazy closed - loop system @xmath2 . ]    the contribution of this paper consists in casting the above problem within the hybrid framework summarized in @xcite and proposing two transmission policies for the transmission - lazy sensors which preserve the ( global exponential ) stability of the original closed - loop system .",
    "this result is achieved without requiring any modification to the design of the original controller . for simplicity , we first consider two transmission policies based on the state of the plant and the measurement error through a suitable lyapunov - like function : +  a _ synchronous transmission policy _ where each sensor is aware of the conditions of the other sensors so that a transmission is a global decision of the sensing node . in this case , the sensors transmit a new sample all together when some suitable condition occurs ; +  an _ asynchronous transmission policy _ where each sensor knows its own measurement error and the state of the plant , which is available in the sensing node .",
    "then , it decides autonomously ( namely , without any information on the measurement error of the other sensors ) whether or not to transmit a new sample .",
    "+ then , we remove the dependence from the state by showing that the closed - loop results achieved by the transmission - lazy sensors are preserved when the information on the state ( state - feedback ) is replaced by an estimate from an observer ( output feedback ) located in the sensing node . to this aim",
    ", the adopted hybrid formulation is a fundamental tool .",
    "within the existing literature , the results in this paper can be seen as a specific application of the hybrid framework @xcite to a peculiar control problem . in this sense ,",
    "our paper is a constructive solution along the general lines of @xcite , where lyapunov tools and the hybrid framework of @xcite are used in similar contexts .",
    "moreover , the motivation behind our work is that of event - triggered sampling where many interesting results have been published in recent years ( see in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "additional work sharing the scenario of figure  [ fig : sl ] is that of @xcite and references therein , where the feedback signal is affected by an undesired quantization effect , rather than the presence of the communication channel . within the event - triggered sampling context ,",
    "taking into account linear systems , our work complements @xcite , by casting similar problems and approaches within the hybrid systems framework , and proposing asynchronous transmission policies which are different from the synchronous ones considered in @xcite .",
    "we show in the paper how restricting the attention to linear systems ( whereas @xcite considers nonlinear systems ) allows us to design transmission policies which lead to improved results , both in terms of architectures and of achievable performance , as compared to those in @xcite where , since a much more general nonlinear scenario is considered , the results obtained are more conservative .",
    "finally , this work extends the results proposed in @xcite by enforcing a dwell - time between transmissions and by introducing exponential bounds on the asymptotic stability guaranteed by the transmission policies . finally , practical stability results of the output feedback case in @xcite are now replaced by asymptotic ( exponential ) stability results .",

    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the problem data .",
    "then , in sections [ sec : synchronous ] , [ sec : asynchronous ] , and [ sec : output_feedback ] we illustrate the two policies first using information from the state of the plant , then relaxing this requirement by introducing an observer .",

    "looking at figure [ fig : sl ] , the arising _ transmission - lazy closed - loop system _ @xmath98 , namely the closed - loop system of through the interconnection @xmath99 , is a hybrid system which combines together the continuous dynamics of the plant - controller cascade @xmath87 and the discrete dynamics of the t - lazy sensors @xmath96 .",
    "its continuous dynamics can be modeled by @xmath100 where @xmath63 takes into account the plant - controller cascade dynamics while @xmath101 denotes the _ state _ of the t - lazy sensors , ( each element @xmath102 of @xmath97 is related to the @xmath103th - sensor ) , which replaces the interconnection @xmath94 of @xmath86 with @xmath104 , which is kept constant during flows by @xmath105 .",

    "therefore , a _ transmission policy _ is given by the tuple @xmath128 .",
    "the transmission of a sample is modeled in as an instantaneous reset of the value @xmath97 , which will typically assign to @xmath97 the current value of the output @xmath0 .",
    "the proposed sample transmission model is a rough abstraction of a ( possibly convoluted ) process where the overall dynamics of the transmission channel plays a fundamental role .",
    "for example , the model does not consider transmission delays , noise corruption of the samples , packet drop , and many other features of digital transmission .",
    "while these phenomena concur to the evaluation of the closed - loop performance , within a certain bounded magnitude , they will not affect the main stability results established below .",
    "in particular , relying on the robustness to small perturbations guaranteed by the hybrid framework @xcite , the stability of our closed loop still holds in the presence of ( small ) transmission noise and delays ( see section [ sec : robustness ] ) .",

    "this behavior is modeled by the definition of the sets @xmath143 and @xmath144 . in particular , from , the typical behavior of the t - lazy closed loop is to transmit a new sample only if the pair @xmath145 satisfies the criterion @xmath146 and if at least @xmath126 units of time have elapsed from the last transmission .      the synchronous transmission policy @xmath147 is based on two main parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149 .    *",
    "@xmath148 guarantees a proportionality between the norm of the error @xmath142 and the current state @xmath63 , to avoid an asymptotic growth to infinity of the error @xmath142 while @xmath63 remains bounded .",

    "@xmath434 is a ( outer semicontinuous , convex and not - empty ) set valued mapping of radius @xmath446 , centered at @xmath447 .",

    "the new solutions have an `` excess '' of flow which exactly characterizes _",

    "using the fact that the original model satisfies the basic conditions ( see section  [ sec : preliminaries ] ) , the continuity of the flow map in , and the fact that each signal @xmath431 is bounded by @xmath450 , we invoke ( * ? ? ?",

    "it follows that the synchronous transmission policy is robust to ( small ) measurement noise , parameters uncertainty and transmission delays .",
    "this property corresponds to semiglobal practical stability , where _ practical _ refers to the fact that solutions converge to a neighborhood of @xmath71 given by @xmath452 , while _ semiglobal _ refers to the fact that the initial compact set @xmath21 can be taken arbitrarily large .",
    "note that similar arguments can be used to establish robustness of each policy presented in this paper .    while this section illustrates the robustness of our scheme for small disturbances and/or perturbations , it is also of interest to characterize some level of robustness in the presence of large seldom events , such as packet corruption or loss within the transmission network .",
    "this phenomenon can be captured by adding an extra state to ( [ eq : lazy_sys_flow ] ) , ( [ eq : lazy_sys_jump ] ) , which acts like an input matched disturbance to the right hand side of the first equation in ( [ eq : lazy_sys_flow ] ) and remains constant between jumps .",
    "robustness to this ( non - small ) disturbance can then be addressed by making assumptions on its persistency ( for example one may use dwell - time or average dwell - time assumptions between packet losses , that is nonzero occurrences of this disturbance ) and exploiting the strict decrease given by our lyapunov functions to dominate the effect of this large but not persistent disturbance . developing this analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "note that the solid curve , corresponding to a smaller value of @xmath172 results in a significantly reduced data rate , as compared to the other selection ( gray ) whose trace is almost coincident with the nominal closed - loop ( thin red curve ) , namely the closed - loop with no transmission channel .",
    "the bottom row of figure  [ examplea : fig1 ] shows the same simulations with the addition of a uniform random number between -0.1 and 0.1 added to each transmitted sample , representing transmission noise affecting the communication channel . comparing the solid traces in the upper and bottom rows it appears that the channel noise negatively affects the transmission rate but , as indicated in section  [ sec : robustness ] , closed - loop ( practical ) stability is preserved .",
