    "the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 are identified , so one gets the orbifold @xmath22 .",

    "we are interested in the rs scheme with two 3d branes with equal and opposite tensions located in 5-th dimension at the points @xmath23 ( called tev brane ) and @xmath24 ( called plank brane ) . the sm fields are constrained to the tev brane , while the gravity propagates in all five spatial dimensions .",
    "it is necessary to note that metric ( [ metric ] ) is chosen in such a way that 4-dimensional coordinates @xmath25 are galilean on the tev brane where all the sm fields live , since the warp factor is equal to unity at @xmath26 . due to the warp factor in the metric ,",

    "we choose @xmath28 to be of the order of several tev to tens tev , while @xmath1 is allowed to vary from hundred mev to tens gev .",
