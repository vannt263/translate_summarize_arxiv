    "finding the optimal approach to accurate computations of energy bands in crystals still is an active research topic in condensed matter theory . over the last few decades , the field has been dominated by formalisms based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "a central object within the dft framework is the exchange - correlation functional and the most common approximations to it are the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite . while formally a ground - state theory , dft has been successfully applied to the computation of energy bands for a variety of systems . for metals , in particular",
    ", it often provides good agreement with @xmath3-space dispersions and fermi surfaces determined by photoemission measurements .",
    "the success has been limited , on the other hand , for semiconducting and insulating compounds since with either the lda or the gga band gaps are systematically underestimated .",
    "this is typically referred to as the band - gap problem .",
    "such difficulties in canonical dft are obviously not surprising because the correlation hole of an electron added to the conduction - band states or removed from the valence bands is related to polarization effects , charge relaxation , and quantum fluctuations , and it is therefore different from that of electrons in the charge neutral ground state ( gs ) . in distinction to gs correlations , mostly of van der waals type @xcite , the correlation hole of the additional particle in the @xmath4 configuration involves a substantially long - ranged ( lr ) polarization cloud .",
    "the corresponding quasiparticle ( qp ) , i.e. , the bare particle plus its correlation hole , is moving in the form of a bloch wave through the system .",
    "an accurate description of the energy bands requires an accurate description of the qp s , i.e. , the correlation holes .",
    "the lda and gga potentials , for example , that depend only on the local electron density and gradient , respectively , are not able to correctly describe this correlation hole of the extra particle introduced in the system . improved results for band widths and band gaps can be obtained by post - lda / gga computational schemes  @xcite based on the _ gw _ approximation @xcite .",
    "the _ gw _ method brings in the lr part of the correlation hole by including screening of the bare coulomb interactions .",
    "it provides band gaps in reasonably good agreement with the experiment , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "however , a treatment of short - range ( sr ) correlations , in particular , on - site correlations such as those in _ d_- and _ f_-metal oxides , is much more difficult within the _ gw _ approach .",
    "other dft - based formalisms aim at improving the approximate exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "exact - exchange ( exx ) treatments in kohn - sham ( ks ) band - structure schemes were introduced by kotani  @xcite , grling  @xcite , and stdele _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , bringing semiconductor band gaps in very good agreement with experimental values  @xcite .",
    "such exx schemes gave rise to orbital - dependent functionals and to optimized effective potential ( oep ) techniques , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "better agreement with the experiment for band gaps can be also achieved by using hybrid ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and range - separated  @xcite functionals that incorporate some fraction of nonlocal hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange .",
    "a conceptually different approach to energy bands in crystals rests on _ ab initio _ wave - function ( wf ) electronic - structure theory .",
    "@xcite many - body wf s are explicitly computed with this approach and the relevant information on the role of various correlation effects can be further mapped onto a qp model .",
    "well - defined and controllable approximations initially developed and for a long time tested in molecular quantum chemistry ( qc ) are employed , which ensures a reliable and transparent description of the correlation hole of the qp .",
    "band structure calculations based on qc methods were mainly focused on nonmetalic systems @xcite . either second - order mller - plesset theory ( mp2),@xcite coupled - cluster ( cc ) techniques,@xcite or an effective local hamiltonian approach ( lha ) @xcite were used . with wf - based approaches to solids , it is crucial to make use of the local character of the sr part of the correlation hole , as it is done for example in the lha  @xcite or in local mp2 treatments @xcite .",
    "sets of real - space , localized orbitals are thereby employed , being either derived by various localization procedures @xcite from the canonical bloch states  @xcite or obtained directly in the crystal hf calculation by using a wannier representation and real - space iterative procedures .",
    "@xcite    while the lha , in particular , has been earlier shown to provide results in good agreement with the experiment for ionic ( or partly ionic ) insulators such as mgo , bn , zns , and tio@xmath5 ,  @xcite the goal of the present work is to analyze to which accuracy wf - based methods and the local hamiltonian model can be employed to determine qp bands of covalent systems .",
    "we select for this purpose diamond , a prototype _ sp _ insulator that has long served to demonstrate the state of the art of first - principle formalisms .",
    "both valence- and conduction - band states are treated on equal footing in the present study , in contrast to earlier qc investigations in the lha framework that mainly focused on the valence - band physics.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secii_quasi ] ,",
    "the description of qp s in the wf qc framework is briefly recapitulated .",

    "the polarizability of the nearby bonds is reduced when quantum fluctuations ( i.e. , lgsc ) are also accounted for as in the cisd calculations .",
    "this reflects the fact that it is more difficult to polarize correlated than uncorrelated electrons in bonds .",
    "since the static relaxation and polarization cloud is built up from uncorrelated electrons in rohf ( bare electron - hole pairs ) and the restricted hf does not account for the different polarization of @xmath108 and @xmath109 electrons in the bonds , a larger bond polarization might be obtained .",
    "larger charge polarization effects may lead to either smaller or larger renormalization for the bare hopping integrals as compared to the cisd treatment .",
    "this is illustrated by the renormalized hopping terms in table  [ hop_renormal2 ] obtained from the rohf calculations .",
    "one possible , straightforward way to incorporate spin polarization in the hf approach would consist in treating polarization effects around the extra hole or electron by means of unrestricted hf .",
