    "the evolution of the clustering of galaxies as a function of redshift provides a sensitive probe of the underlying cosmology and theories of structure formation . in an ideal world we would measure the spatial correlation function of galaxies as a function of redshift and type and use this to compare with the predictions of different galaxy formation theories .",
    "observationally , however , our ability to efficiently measure galaxy spectra falls rapidly as a function of limiting magnitude and consequently we are limited to deriving spatial statistics from small galaxy samples and at relatively bright magnitude limits ( e.g.  @xmath8 , le fevre et al .",
    "1996 , carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to increase the size of the galaxy samples and thereby reduce the shot noise the standard approach has been to measure the angular correlation function , i.e.  the projected spatial correlation function ( brainerd et al .",
    "1996 , woods and fahlman 1997 ) . while this allows us to extend the measure of the clustering of galaxies to fainter magnitude limits ( @xmath9 , villumsen et al .",
    "1997 ) it has an associated limitation . for a given magnitude limit",
    "the amplitude of the angular correlation function is sensitive to the width of the galaxy redshift distribution , n(z ) . at faint magnitude limits",
    "n(z ) is very broad and consequently the clustering signal is diluted due to the large number of randomly projected pairs .    in this letter",
    "we introduce a new approach for quantifying the evolution of the angular correlation function ; we apply photometric redshifts ( connolly et al .",
    "1995 , lanzetta et al .",
    "1996 , gwyn and hartwick 1996 , sawicki et al .",
    "1997 ) to isolate particular redshift intervals . in so doing we can remove much of the foreground and background contamination of galaxies and measure an amplified angular clustering .",
    "we discuss here the particular application of this technique to the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al .",
    "from version 2 of the `` drizzled '' hdf images ( fruchter and hook 1996 ) we construct a photometric catalog , in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 photometric passbands , using the sextractor image detection and analysis package of bertin and arnout ( 1996 ) .",
    "object detection was performed on the @xmath13 images using a 1 arcsec detection kernel . for those galaxies with @xmath14 we measure magnitudes in all four bands using a 2 arcsec diameter aperture magnitude .",
    "the final catalog comprises 926 galaxies and covers @xmath15 sq arcmin .    from these data",
    "we construct a photometric redshift catalog . for @xmath16 ,",
    "we apply the techniques of connolly et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) , i.e.  we calibrate the photometric redshifts using a training set of galaxies with known redshift . for fainter magnitudes ( @xmath17 )",
    "we estimate the redshifts by fitting empirical spectral energy distributions ( coleman et al .  1980 ) to the observed colors ( gwyn and hartwick 1996 , lanzetta et al .",
    "1996 and sawicki et al.1997 ) .",
    "a comparison between the predicted and observed redshifts shows the photometric redshift relation has an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath18 .",
    "we calculate the angular correlation function , @xmath19 , using the estimator derived by landy and szalay ( 1993 ) , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the autocorrelation function of the data and random points respectively and @xmath23 is the cross - correlation between the data and random points . in the limit of weak clustering",
    "this statistic is the 2-point realization of a more general representation of edge - corrected n - point correlation functions ( szapudi and szalay 1997 ) . as such it provides an optimal estimator for the hdf where the small field - of - view makes the corrections for the survey geometry significant .",
    "we calculate @xmath19 between 1 and 220 arcsec with logarithmic binning . in the subsequent analysis",
    "we impose a lower limit of 3 arcsec to remove any artificial correlations due to the possibility that the image analysis routines may decompose a single galaxy image into multiple detections ( at @xmath0 this corresponds to 12 h@xmath4 kpc for @xmath24 ) . for the random realizations we construct a catalog of 10000 points ( approximately 50 times the number of galaxies per redshift interval ) with the same geometry as the photometric data . to account for the small angular size of the hdf we apply an integral constraint assuming that the form of @xmath19 is given by a power law with a slope of @xmath1 .",
    "errors are estimated assuming poisson statistics .",
    "the expected uncertainty in each bin is calculated from the number of random pairs ( when scaled to the number of data points ) . over the range of angles for which we calculate",
    "the correlation function errors derived from poisson statistics are comparable to those from bootstrap resampling ( villumsen et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in figure 1a we show the angular correlation function of the full @xmath25 galaxy sample ( filled triangles ) .",
    "the error bars represent one sigma errors .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function is comparable to that found by villumsen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for an r selected galaxy sample in the hdf .",
    "it is consistent with a positive detection of a correlation signal at the 2@xmath26 significance level .",
    "superimposed on this figure is the correlation function for those galaxies with @xmath27 ( filled squares ) . isolating this particular redshift interval the amplitude of the correlation function",
    "is amplified by approximately a factor of ten .",
    "if we parameterize the angular correlation function as a power law with @xmath28 then , from limber s equations ( limber 1954 ) , we can estimate how the amplitude , @xmath29 , should scale as a function of redshift and width of the redshift distribution , @xmath30}{\\gamma[\\gamma/2 ] } r_0^\\gamma \\frac { \\int_0^{\\infty } dz n(z)^2 ( 1+z)^{-(3+\\epsilon ) } x(z)^{1-\\gamma }   g(z ) }        { \\left [ \\int_0^\\infty n(z ) dz \\right]^{-2}}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 is the comoving angular diameter distance , @xmath32 n(z ) is the redshift distribution and @xmath33 represents a parameterization of the evolution of the spatial correlation function ( see below ) .    for a normalized gaussian redshift distribution , centered at @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and dispersion @xmath36 , @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath37 . therefore , the amplitude of the angular correlation function should be inversely proportional to the width of the redshift distribution over which it is averaged . in figure 1 if we assume that the magnitude limited sample ( @xmath25 ) has a mean redshift of @xmath38 and a dispersion of @xmath39 ( consistent with the derived photometric redshift distribution ) then isolating the redshift interval @xmath27 should result in an amplification of a factor of 5 in the correlation function ( comparable to that which we detect ) .",
    "a limitation on studying large - scale clustering with the hdf is its small field of view . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the 220 arcsec maximal extent of the wfpc2 images corresponds to 0.7 h@xmath4 mpc  and 0.9 h@xmath4 mpc  at redshifts of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "isolating very narrow intervals in redshift ( e.g.  binning on scales of @xmath43 , the intrinsic dispersion in the photometric - redshift relation ) can , therefore , result in the correlation function being dominated by a single structure , e.g.  a cluster of galaxies . to minimize the effect of the inhomogeneous redshift distribution observed in the hdf ( cohen et al . 1996 )",
    "we divide the hdf sample into bins of width @xmath44 based on their photometric redshifts .    for each redshift interval , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we fit the observed correlation function , with a power law with a slope of @xmath1 , over the range @xmath49 arcsec . from this fit",
    "we measure the amplitude of the correlation function at a fiducial scale of 10 arcsec .",
    "the choice of this particular angle is simply a convenience as it is well sampled at all redshift intervals . in figure 2",
    "we show the evolution of the amplitude as a function of redshift . for redshifts",
    "@xmath2 the relation is relatively flat with a mean value of 0.12 . at @xmath50 we would expect the amplitude to rise rapidly with redshift due to the angular diameter distance relation .",
    "we find , however , that the amplitude remains flat even for the lowest redshift bin .",
    "this implies that there is a bias in the clustering signal inferred from the @xmath45 redshift interval ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the value of the correlation function amplitude is comparable to those derived from deep magnitude limited samples of galaxies .",
    "hudon and lilly ( 1997 ) find an amplitude , measured at 1 degree , of @xmath51 for an @xmath52 galaxy sample .",
    "woods and fahlman for a somewhat deeper survey , @xmath53 , derive a value of @xmath54 . at",
    "these magnitude limits the mean redshift is approximately 0.56 ( hudon and lilly , 1997 ) and the width is comparable to the redshift intervals of @xmath44 that we apply to the hdf data .",
    "therefore , our measured amplitude of @xmath55 is in good agreement with these previous results .",
    "we parameterize the redshift evolution of the spatial correlation function as @xmath7 , where values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 correspond to a constant clustering amplitude in comoving coordinates , constant clustering in proper coordinates and linear growth of clustering respectively ( peebles 1980 ) . from equation 2",
    "we construct the expected evolution of the amplitude of the angular correlation function , projected to 10 arcsec , for a range of values of @xmath3 , @xmath33 and @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic uncertainty of the photometric redshift for each galaxy can be approximated by a gaussian distribution , with a dispersion @xmath60 ( consistent with observations ) , and determine the n(z ) within a particular redshift interval as being composed of a sum of these gaussian distributions . in figure 2",
    "we illustrate the form of this evolution for two sets of models , one with @xmath3=5.4 h@xmath4 mpc  and the second with @xmath3=2.37 h@xmath4 mpc(the best fit to the data ) . for each model",
    "we assume @xmath40 and plot the evolutionary tracks for @xmath61 ( solid line ) , @xmath57 ( dotted line ) and @xmath58 ( dashed line ) . for @xmath2 and a low @xmath3  the observed amplitude of the correlation function is well matched by that of the predicted evolution . for redshifts @xmath50 the observed",
    "clustering is approximately a factor of three below the @xmath3=2.37 h@xmath4 mpc  model .",
    "this is not unexpected given the selection criteria for the hdf .",
    "the field was chosen to avoid bright galaxies visible on a poss ii photographic plate .",
    "this corresponds to a lower limit for the hdf photometric sample of @xmath62 ( marc postman , private communication ) .",
    "the redshift distribution for an @xmath63 magnitude limited sample has a median value of @xmath64 and a width of approximately @xmath65 ( lilly et al .",
    "therefore , by excluding the bright galaxies within the hdf we artificially suppress the clustering amplitude in the redshift range @xmath66 .",
    "we can expect , as we have found , that the first redshift bin in the hdf will significantly underestimate the true clustering signal .",
    "those redshifts bins at @xmath67 are unlikely to be significantly affected by this magnitude limit .    to constrain the models for the clustering evolution",
    "we , therefore , exclude the lowest redshift point in our sample , i.e.  @xmath45 , and determine the goodness - of - fit of each model using a @xmath68 statistic .",
    "the three dimensional @xmath68 distribution was derived for the phase space given by @xmath69 h@xmath4 mpc , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we find that @xmath33 is relatively insensitive to the value of @xmath59 with a variation of typically 0.4 for the range @xmath72 .",
    "as this is small when compared to the intrinsic uncertainty in measuring @xmath33 we integrated the probability distribution over all values of @xmath59 .    in figure 3a we show the range of possible values for @xmath33 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the errorbars represent the 95% confidence intervals derived from the integrated probability distribution .",
    "figure 3b shows the log likelihood for these fits as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the hdf data are best fitted by a model with a comoving @xmath73 h@xmath4 mpc  and @xmath5 .",
    "the value of @xmath3  is comparable to recent spectroscopic and photometric surveys with hudon and lilly ( 1996 ) finding @xmath3= 2.75 @xmath74 h@xmath4 mpc  and le fvre et al.(1996 ) @xmath3= 2.03 @xmath75 h@xmath4 mpc .    given our redshift range , the i - band selected hdf data are comparable to a sample of galaxies selected in the restframe u ( @xmath76 ) through v ( @xmath77 ) . to tie these observations into the clustering of local galaxies we , therefore , compare our results with the b band selected clustering analysis of davis and peebles ( 1983 ) and loveday et al.(1992 ) . assuming a canonical value of @xmath3= 5.4 h@xmath4 mpc  we require @xmath6 to match the high redshift hdf data ( i.e.  significantly more evolution than that predicted by linear theory ) .",
    "a bias may be introduced into the analysis of the clustering evolution due to the fact that the i band magnitude selection corresponds to a selection function that is redshift dependent ( see above ) .",
    "if , as is observed in the local universe , the clustering length is dependent on galaxy type then selecting different inherent populations may mimic the observed clustering evolution . to determine the effect of this bias we allow @xmath3  to be a function of redshift ( with @xmath3  varying by 2 h@xmath4 mpc  from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this change in @xmath3  is consistent with the morphological dependence of @xmath3  observed locally ( loveday et al .",
    "1995 , iovino et al .",
    "1993 ) . allowing for this redshift dependence",
    "reduces the value of @xmath33 by approximately 0.5 for all values of @xmath3  ( e.g.  for @xmath3= 5.4 h@xmath4 mpc  @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that even with these large values of @xmath33 and accounting for the bias due to the i band selection the evolution of the clustering in the hdf is better fitted by a low value of @xmath3  ( the log likelihood is 4.15 less than the fit to @xmath3=2.37 h@xmath4 mpc ) .",
    "parameterising the evolution of galaxy clustering is , therefore , not particularly well represented by the form @xmath7 and it may be better for future studies to discuss the evolution in terms of the amplitude at a particular comoving scale rather than @xmath3  and @xmath33 .",
    "photometric redshifts provide a simple statistical means of directly measuring the evolution of the clustering of galaxies . by isolating narrow intervals in redshift space we can reduce the number of randomly projected pairs and detect the clustering signal to high redshift and faint magnitude limits . applying these techniques to the hdf",
    "we can characterize the evolution of the angular 2 pt correlation function out to @xmath81 . for redshifts",
    "@xmath82 we find that the amplitude of the angular correlation function is best parameterized by a comoving @xmath3=2.37 h@xmath4 mpc  and @xmath5 . to match , however , the canonical local value for the clustering length , @xmath3=5.4 h@xmath4 mpc , requires @xmath83 , significantly more than simple linear growth .",
    "it must be noted that while these results are in good agreement with those from published photometric and spectroscopic surveys ( le fvre et al 1996 , hudon and lilly 1996 ) there are two caveats that should be considered before applying them to constrain models of structure formation .",
    "the small angular extent of the hdf ( at a redshift , @xmath0 , the field - of - view of the hdf is approximately 0.9 h@xmath4 mpc ) means that fluctuations on scales larger than we probe will contribute to the variance of the measured clustering ( szapudi and colombi 1996 ) .",
    "secondly , the requirement that the hdf be positioned such that it avoids bright galaxies ( @xmath63 ) biases our clustering statistics by artificially suppressing the number of low redshift galaxies ( a bias that will be present in most deep photometric surveys ) .",
    "therefore , the clustering evolution in the hdf may not necessarily be representative of the general field population . given this , there is enormous potential for the application of this technique to systematic wide angle multicolor surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ,    we would like to thank marc postman and mark dickinson for helpful comments on the selection and interpretation of the hubble deep field data .",
