    "the boltzmann equation is of central importance in many fields of physics and , since its original formulation in the theory of gases it has received a whole range of extensions to other domains like plasma physics , nuclear physics , or semiconductors . in these fields , boltzmann scattering integrals",
    "are extensively used to model relaxation and thermalization processes .",
    "adapted versions of the h - theorem ensure that , indeed , the equations describe the steady evolution of the system towards the proper thermal equilibrium .",
    "early attempts to derive this irreversible behavior from the quantum - mechanical evolution have shown @xcite that the range of validity of boltzmann - like equations correspond to the low - coupling , slowly - varying , long - time regime .    in more recent years with the experimental possibility to produce and control transport and optical phenomena at ultra - short timescales , quantum - kinetic theories@xcite",
    "have been devised in order to describe rapid processes in which coherence is still present , together with the onset of dephasing and relaxation .",
    "this means that the kinetics has to describe not only real - number quantities like occupation probabilities , but also complex , off - diagonal density - matrix elements , and their interference effects .",
    "not only fast dynamics , but also the necessity to extend the theory beyond the weak - interaction limit has prompted the development of quantum kinetics .",
    "a typical example is provided by the interaction of carriers with lo - phonons in semiconductor quantum dots , where a phonon bottleneck is predicted by the boltzmann result ( see ref .   and references therein ) , in contrast to the quantum - kinetic treatment of quantum - dot polarons in the strong - coupling regime@xcite and many experimental findings .",
    "the quantum - kinetic theory using non - equilibrium green s functions ( gf ) is one of the basic tools in this field .",
    "its central object is the one - particle , two - time gf , for which closed equations are provided .",
    "unfortunately , the large numerical effort needed for solving these equations has limited previous applications of the two - time formalism to the early - time regime .",
    "the method has been used to describe the ultrafast optical excitation of semiconductors where the interaction of carriers with lo - phonons@xcite , the coulomb interaction of carriers@xcite , and their combined influence@xcite have been studied .",
    "calculations based on the two - time formalism also have been applied in plasma physics@xcite and for nuclear matter@xcite .    since the physically relevant information ( e.g. population and polarization dynamics ) is contained in the one - time gf ( the two - time gf at equal times ) ,",
    "it is clear that a closed equation for this quantity would greatly simplify the procedure .",
    "this explains the huge popularity of the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz ( gkba ) @xcite , an approximation which expresses the two - time gf in terms of its one - time component .",
    "the gkba has been extensively used in the past for a description of non - markovian contributions to ultra - fast relaxation and dephasing processes .",
    "signatures of non - markovian effects have been investigated for the interaction of carriers with lo - phonons@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the built - up of screening has been studied on the basis of a quantum - kinetic description using the gkba@xcite and included in scattering calculations@xcite .",
    "results of the one- and two - time formulation have been compared for early times addressing the carrier - carrier scattering@xcite as well as the interaction of carriers with lo - phonons@xcite .",
    "boltzmann - like kinetic equations are obtained from the one - time theory based on the gkba by further approximations : memory effects are neglected ( markov limit ) and free particle energies are used ( low coupling limit ) .",
    "one encounters therefore a situation in which only after taking two major approximation steps , one reaches a kinetic theory for which the physically expected correct relaxation behavior can be proven analytically . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no attempt in the literature to explore systematically the relaxation properties of either the two - time formalism or its one - time approximation , despite their wide applications and the obvious fundamental importance of the problem .",
    "for example , the interest in laser devices based on quantum wells@xcite and quantum dots @xcite requires a good understanding of the long - time behavior of the carriers in their evolution to equilibrium . furthermore , the importance of non - markovian effects in the quantum - kinetic treatment of optical gain spectra for quantum - dot lasers has been discussed recently.@xcite    in this paper , the relaxation properties in the long - time limit are compared for the one - time and two - time quantum kinetics . as a test case",
    ", we consider the interaction of carriers with lo - phonons in semiconductor nanostructures , which is the dominant relaxation mechanism for low carrier densities and elevated temperatures .",
    "we study the optical excitation of quantum wells and quantum dots with short laser pulses and calculate the dephasing of the coherent polarization together with the relaxation and thermalization of the excited carrier populations .",
    "the equilibrium state of the interacting system is defined by the kubo - martin - schwinger condition .",
    "we investigate if and under which conditions this equilibrium state is reached in the time - dependent solution of the quantum kinetic models .",
    "this provides a unique way to address the range of validity of the involved approximations .",
    "the markovian limit of the kinetics , as described by the boltzmann equation , is a good example to start with , because its relaxation properties are well understood and rigorously proven . to be specific",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian for the interacting system of carriers and phonons , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are indices for the carrier states and the momentum @xmath2 is the phononic quantum number .",
    "the corresponding creation and annihilation operators for carriers and phonons are given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the time evolution of the average occupation number ( population distribution ) @xmath5 has the form @xmath6 with the transition rates given by fermi s golden rule @xmath7 for a phonon bath in thermal equilibrium , @xmath8 is a bose - einstein distribution with the lattice temperature , and the @xmath9-functions ensure the strict energy conservation in the @xmath10 transition process assisted by either the absorption or the emission of a phonon .    the following properties of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) can be analytically proven : ( i ) the total number of carriers @xmath11 is conserved , ( ii ) positivity is preserved , i.e. , if at @xmath12 one has @xmath13 then this remains true at any later time , ( iii ) the fermi distribution @xmath14^{-1 } $ ] is a steady - state solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) and ( iv ) this steady state is the large time limit of the solution @xmath15 for any positive initial condition _ provided _ a certain connectivity property holds .",
    "this property is fulfilled if any state of the carrier system can be reached from any other state through a chain of transitions having non - zero rates .",
    "the temperature of the stationary fermi distribution is the lattice temperature , and the chemical potential is fixed by the total number of carriers .",
    "if the set of carrier states is not connected in the above sense , any connected component behaves like a separate fluid and reaches equilibrium with its own chemical potential .    as satisfying",
    "as this picture looks , several problems arise here .",
    "the carrier - phonon interaction is essential as a relaxation mechanism but the carrier energies themselves are taken as if unaffected by it .",
    "both in the energy conserving @xmath9-functions and in the final fermi distribution these energies appear as unperturbed .",
    "this corresponds to a low - coupling regime , which may not be valid in practical situations . even in weakly polar semiconductors like gaas , the confined nature of the states in quantum wells ( qws ) and",
    "even more so in quantum dots ( qds ) , gives rise to an enhanced effective interaction @xcite .",
    "for higher coupling constants one expects departures from the simple picture discussed above .",
    "moreover , in the case of a strong coupling and with the inclusion of memory effects , neglected in the markovian limit , the energy conservation is not expected to hold .",
    "finally , and specifically for lo phonons , their dispersionless spectrum , associated with strict energy conservation turns the system into a disconnected one .",
    "indeed , each carrier can move only up and down a ladder with fixed steps of size @xmath16 but can not jump on states outside this ladder . a phonon bottleneck effect in qds",
    "was predicted on these grounds.@xcite",
    "it is clear that in most practical cases one has to turn to quantum - kinetic treatments in which both energy renormalizations and memory effects are considered .",
    "such formalisms are provided by the two - time green s function kinetics or by one - time approximations to it . in view of the discussion of the previous section ,",
    "the following questions , regarding the relaxation properties of the quantum kinetics , are in order : ( i ) is the particle number conserved ? ( ii ) is positivity conserved ? ( iii ) is the system evolving to a steady state ?",
    "( iv ) if yes , is this steady state a thermal equilibrium one ? in what sense ?    to our knowledge , with the exception of the first question , which can be easily answered affirmatively , there is no definite and proven answer available in the literature .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate how numerical solutions of the quantum - kinetic equations for realistic situations behave in the discussed respects . for this purpose",
    ", we compare the results of the two - time and the one - time approach .",
    "in this section we specify the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : el - ph ] ) , for the case of a homogeneous two - band semiconductor , where carriers interact with lo - phonons via the frhlich coupling , @xmath17 the carrier quantum numbers are the band index @xmath18 and the 3d- ( for the bulk case ) or 2d- ( for qws ) momentum @xmath19 .",

    "additional terms to this hamiltonian describe the optical excitation and the coulomb interaction in the usual way.@xcite we consider only sufficiently low excitations so that carrier - carrier scattering and screening effects are negligible . then the only contribution of the coulomb interaction is the hartree - fock renormalization of the single particle energies and of the rabi frequency .",
    "the object of the kinetic equations is the two - time gf , @xmath24 .",
    "we use the parametrization of the two - time plane @xmath25 in terms of the main time @xmath26 and relative time @xmath27 .",

    "the above set of equations has to be supplemented by specifying the initial conditions .",
    "for all the times prior to the arrival of the optical pulse , the system consists of the electron - hole vacuum in the presence of the phonon bath .",
    "this is an equilibrium situation , characterized by diagonal gfs , which depend only on the relative time .",
    "more precisely , one has @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the retarded gf of the unexcited system .",
    "the calculation of this gf is an equilibrium problem , namely that of the frhlich _ polaron_. the polaronic gf is the solution of the @xmath27-equation , @xmath44 in which , to be consistent with the @xmath26-evolution described above , the rpa self - energy is again used .",
    "the vacuum gf of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacgf ] ) is not only the starting value for the gf in the main - time evolution but it also appears in the integrals over the past which require gf values before the arrival of the optical pulse .",
    "moreover , the presence of the polaronic gf brings into the picture the complexities of the spectral features of the polaron , with energy renormalization and phonon satellites .",
    "finally , the decay of the polaronic gf introduces a natural memory depth into the problem .",
    "an example is seen in fig .",
    "[ pol_gf ] where , due to a rather strong coupling constant and a high temperature , the decay with the relative time @xmath27 is rapid .",

    "the physically relevant information is found in the equal - time lesser gf , which contains the carrier populations and the polarization .",
    "this program is carried out for the case of a cdte ( @xmath48 ) qw at room temperature .",
    "the excitation conditions are defined by a gaussian - shaped pulse of 100 fs duration ( fwhm of the intensity ) , having an excess energy of 120mev above the unrenormalized band gap and an area of 0.05 ( in @xmath49 units ) .",
    "this gives rise to carrier densities in the order of @xmath50 , sufficiently low to neglect carrier - carrier scattering .",

    "as seen in figs .",
    "[ pol ] and [ fe ] , the interaction of carriers with lo - phonons provides an efficient dephasing and leads , in a sub - picosecond time interval , to a relaxation of the electron population into a steady - state distribution .",
    "the same is true for the hole population ( not shown ) . before discussing this result",
    "we compare it to the outcome of the one - time calculation .",
    "to obtain from the kadanoff - baym equations for the two - time gf a closed set of equations for the equal - time lesser gf , @xmath51 , one can use the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz ( gkba)@xcite . the ansatz reduces the time - offdiagonal gfs appearing in the collision terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coll_less ] ) to diagonal ones with the help of the spectral ( retarded or advanced ) gfs .",
    "therefore , the gkba has to be supplemented with a choice of spectral gfs . in our case",

    "( [ eq : kms ] ) involves their fourier transform with respect to this time .",
    "the relationship is known as the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition or as the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , and leads to a thermal equilibrium population given by @xmath55 the two - time theory provides the excitation - dependent retarded gf along with the lesser one , the formalism being a system of coupled equation for these two quantities .",
    "nevetheless , in the low excitation regime used here the difference between the actual retarded gf and its vacuum counterpart @xmath56 turns out to be negligible , as can be checked numerically .",

    "( [ eq : kmspop ] ) without loss of accuracy .",
    "the thermal equilibrium distribution @xmath57 obtained from the kms condition is the generalization of the fermi function of the non - interacting case and is used as a check of a proper thermalization .",

    "[ kms_a ] .",
    "the two - time calculation is in good agreement with the kms curve , but the one - time evolution is not .",
    "it appears that the one - time kinetics produces a steady state with a temperature considerably exceeding that of the phonon bath .",

    "we consider an equidistant energy spacing of @xmath62 between the wl continuum edge , the @xmath60-level and the @xmath59-level , for the electrons and a @xmath63 similar spacing for holes .",
    "the formalism used is the same as for the homogeneous systems but with the momentum replaced by a state quantum number running over the discrete qd states and the wl continuum .",
    "this amounts to neglecting gf matrix elements which are off - diagonal in the state index , but still keeping off - diagonal terms with respect to the band index .",
    "this has been shown to be a reasonable approximation for qds .",
