    "the rapid development of the field of spintronics@xcite over the past two decades has uncovered exciting and novel phenomena related to the dynamics of the electronic spin in a wide variety of systems , ranging from bulk materials to spatially - confined structures @xcite .",
    "fueled by the ever - growing needs for speed , capacity and energy - efficiency in computing , the central objective in understanding and ultimately controlling the spin properties in the solid state has been constantly shifting towards the nano - scale . at these lengths and times",
    "the conventional methods for spin control , based on magnetic fields alone , are limited by scalability issues .",
    "alternative approaches are thus sought and they typically involve electric fields of some form  @xcite .    one way to manipulate spins by purely electrical means relies on the spin - transfer torque mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this approach uses spin - polarized currents to control the direction of the magnetization and has been realized in various nano - structured materials ranging from magnetic multilayers  @xcite to , more recently , single atoms in stm - type geometries  @xcite .",
    "alternative to electric current control is the optical control , such as in the laser - driven ultrafast magnetization switching  @xcite . in a somewhat different context ,",
    "the optical manipulation of single spins in bulk media  @xcite is at the heart of the most promising candidates for the quantum information processing technology  @xcite .",
    "another alternative is based on the idea of an electrostatic control of the spin - density , i.e. of the construction of spin - transistor type devices@xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of gate - modulated spin - pumping  @xcite transistors has been studied theoretically in infinite graphene strips with patterned magnetic implantations  @xcite .",
    "importantly , such devices rely on the efficient transport of spin information between two points in space and time , and require the possibility to actively tune the propagating spin - signal during its transport . in this work",
    "we explore this possibility for atomistic spin - conductors .",
    "we consider a finite mono - atomic wire linking two localized spin - carrying impurities .",
    "when one of the localized spins is set into precession , it generates a perturbation in the spin - density .",
    "this perturbation is carried through the wire by conducting electrons and can be detected in the dynamical response of the second spin .",
    "we show that the propagation of the spin - signal and consequentially the dynamical communication between the two spin centers , can be tuned by means of an electrostatic gate applied to the interconnecting wire .",
    "our main finding is an enhancement of the communication for a certain range of gate voltages .",
    "this is linked to the modification of the electronic structure of the wire induced by the applied electrostatic gate .",
    "because of their considerable size the systems investigated here are still beyond the present numerical capabilities of first - principles dynamics  @xcite and as such they are described by model hamiltonians .",
    "usually the dynamics is approached within the linear response approximation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we go beyond the linear response limit and propose a fully microscopic description based on the time - dependent schrdinger equation , which allows us to describe arbitrary excitations .",
    "in other words our simulations are not limited to small gate voltages or small - angle spin precession .",
    "we use a single - band tight - binding hamiltonian to model the itinerant @xmath0-electrons in our metallic wires and include local heisenberg interactions to a number of magnetic ions ( typically one or two ) .",
    "the latter are modeled as classical spin degrees of freedom and enter on equal footing in the common mixed quantum - classical dynamic portrait of the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ theo ]",
    "we introduce the model system and our theoretical framework .",
    "section [ res1 ] contains the results of our investigations .",
    "firstly we investigate the electron response of an atomic wire , not including magnetic impurities , to local spin excitations .",
    "secondly , we study the dynamical interplay between two spin - impurities electronically connected by the wire and show how such a dynamics is affected by the gate voltage .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions .",
    "a cartoon of the device considered is presented in fig . [ model ] .",
    "this consists of an @xmath3-sites long atomic wire interconnecting two magnetic centers .",
    "the latter , represented in the figure by the spin - vectors , enter our model as substitutional magnetic impurities positioned at the two ends of the wire ( the local spin originates from the deeply localized @xmath1-electrons ) .",
    "one of them , say the left - hand side spin - center @xmath4 , is labeled as `` driven '' , as its precession is induced and sustained by a local ( at that site ) magnetic field .",
    "the other localized spin , @xmath5 , located at the other end of the chain is the `` probe '' spin and it is not directly coupled to any external magnetic field but only to the electron gas . in this way @xmath5 probes the magnetic excitations produced by the driven spin @xmath4 as these propagate through the interconnecting wire . the device is described as a mixed quantum - classical system in the spirit of the ( @xmath0-@xmath1)-model  @xcite , where the time - dependent hamiltonians of the two exchange - coupled spin sub - systems read @xmath6\\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}^{\\alpha\\beta}\\ : , \\nonumber   \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath7 - j \\boldsymbol{s}_{2}(t)\\cdot\\boldsymbol{s}_n(t)\\ : .",

    "as a preliminary step towards the combined quantum - classical dynamics we first address the dynamics of the spin - density of the itinerant electrons in the presence of the two local spins , whose directions are fixed , e.g. @xmath44 .",
    "a spin excitation is produced by a small but finite spatially - localized perturbation in the spin - density .",

    "in other words we study the time evolution of the system with the two local spins parallel to each other starting from the ground state electronic charge density of the system where one of the two spins is tilted by a small angle .",

    "such a feature demonstrates that this finite 1d model atomic system is a relatively efficient waveguide for spin wave - packets ( of sub - femtosecond duration ) at least over the investigated time - scales of a few picoseconds .",
    "( [ eqspec ] ) can also be used to calculate directly the spectra of particular spin observables .",
    "these match perfectly with those calculated by performing the discrete fourier transform @xcite ( dft ) of the time - dependent spin - densities obtained over the finite duration of the dynamic simulation .",
    "clearly , in the absence of the localized impurities ( i.e. for a finite homogeneous tight - binding chain ) @xmath61 can be calculated exactly .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath62 has monotonously decreasing amplitudes from the lowest possible frequency @xmath63 to the maximum one @xmath64 ( expressed in the limit of @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is also true for the case of interaction with the two frozen local impurities ( e.g. for @xmath66 ) as these have a minor effect on the electron hamiltonian . for the parameters typically used in our simulations the corresponding maximum period @xmath67",

    "an analogous mode - occupation patterns have been rigorously analyzed in relation to the dynamical properties of one - dimensional quantum heisenberg spin chains which too have a tight - binding type dispersion relation  @xcite .",

    "again we use the half - filling case , @xmath80 ( one electron per atom ) . from the figure it is immediately noticeable that the effect of the variation of @xmath2 on the excitation spectra is quite similar to the effect of the band - filling in the non - gated case . due to the gate potential , the relative electron populations of the gated and gate - free parts of the chain change ( the gated region is depopulated ) .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath2 [ see fig . [ specgate](b ) ] the excitation spectrum is rather a superposition of two spectra with band fillings below and above @xmath95 ( approximately @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",

    "special attention must be devoted to the intermediate @xmath2 regime in which the dynamics of the probe spin is qualitatively different and uncorrelated to that of the driven one [ see fig . [ gate1](b ) ] .",
    "the typical outcome of the real time dynamics at such intermediate voltages @xmath124 is that the probe spin starts accumulating very big transverse deflections .",

    "cc +    this behaviour in the classical spin dynamics characteristic of certain gate voltages stems from the dominance of the low frequency modes in the electron dynamics at those @xmath2 .",
