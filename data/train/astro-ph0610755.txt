    "consistent with our previous work ( schwartz et al . 2006 ) we assume a minimum total energy in magnetic field and relativistic particles , filling factor = 1 , an electron spectral index m=2.4 with cutoffs at low and high energies tuned to give radio emission from 10@xmath4 hz to 10@xmath5 hz , equal energy in electrons and protons , and that the bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 so that the angle to the line of sight takes on the maximum value , @xmath7 , for a given @xmath8 .",
    "we take the volume of regions 4 through 14 to be cylinders of the ( resolved ) lengths shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : regions ] , and ( unresolved ) radii assumed to be 05 = 3.62 kpc at the redshift z=0.72 of this quasar .",
    "the results for b and @xmath8 are presented in the rightmost panel of the figure . with the above assumptions the jet shows similar structure along its length .",
    "we give the deprojected distance on the top axis by assuming @xmath9 .",
    "we note that if the radii were all 1 kpc , the values for b and @xmath8 would be a factor of 1.44 higher .",
    "the systematic effects of our assumptions allow alternate profiles , but the numerical values are constrained within a factor roughly 2 . in particular , the increase in @xmath8 at the end of the jet would be peculiar in the ic / cmb scenario . for the baseline values of b and @xmath8 , we can derive the kinetic power , the minimum electron lorentz factor , and the relativistic electron density as a function of distance along the jet . for deprojected distances 200 to 600 kpc from the quasar , regions 13 to 6 , we require a cutoff to the electron spectrum at energies below @xmath10 and we estimate a kinetic power of approximately ( 12 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , and a total relativistic electron density of roughly ( 23 ) @xmath11 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ."
