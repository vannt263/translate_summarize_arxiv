    "the simplest investigations into a many - body system like a bose - einstein condensate comprise studies of thermal equilibrium properties , and the physics of small fluctuations around thermal equilibrium . for one - dimensional systems ,",
    "very similar behavior is found using either photons in optical fibres or ultra - cold atoms in waveguides .",
    "although techniques are not yet as experimentally advanced in the latter case , preliminary theory and some experimental measurements have already taken place .",
    "the atomic systems have the advantage that relatively long interaction times , large interaction strengths and low losses are possible , thus potentially allowing stringent tests of underlying quantum correlations . in this paper , we extend previous studies of correlations to include the experimentally realistic case of atoms in a waveguide with a harmonic longitudinal confining potential .",
    "the treatment is at finite temperature , and makes use of exact results for the uniform gas , together with a local density approximation .    for strong radial confinement ,",
    "these types of system are examples of one - dimensional quantum ( @xmath0 ) gases @xcite .",
    "they have the important property that in many cases their energy eigenstates are exactly solvable @xcite , resulting in a greatly increased fundamental understanding of the relevant quantum field theory .",
    "for this reason , the study of 1d systems plays an important role in the physics of quantum many - body systems .",
    "it is possible to make first - principle predictions without introducing added approximations like perturbation theory .",
    "this permits direct experimental tests of the underlying many - body quantum physics , as has been demonstrated in photonics with squeezed solitons in optical fibres @xcite .    for ultra - cold atomic systems with repulsive interactions ,",
    "the most interesting and exciting feature is the predicted transition of an interacting gas of bosons to a ` fermionized ' tonks - girardeau @xcite regime at large coupling strengths and low densities .",
    "we have recently made use of the known exact solutions to the uniform one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting bose gas problem to calculate the exact local second - order correlation function at all densities and interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "this is the most direct indication of ` fermionic ' behaviour , since this correlation function is strongly reduced at low density and strong coupling  similar to the case of fermions , where it vanishes exactly , due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the first experimental evidence of reduced or ` antibunched ' correlations in a @xmath0 bose gas has recently been demonstrated in ref .",
    "however , current experiments typically take place in traps , with a longitudinal trapping potential .",
    "provided the trap potential varies slowly , this environment is sufficiently close to a uniform one so that the exact solutions can still be used locally , in an approximation called the local density approximation .    in this paper",
    ", we make use of the local density approximation ( lda ) to calculate the density profile and finite temperature local pair correlation function of a @xmath0 bose gas trapped in a harmonic potential .",
    "the results are valid for sufficiently low longitudinal trap frequencies , and make use of the exact solutions to the plane - wave lieb - liniger model @xcite at finite temperature , together with the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "we mostly focus on regimes with quantum degeneracy .",
    "this requires temperatures @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the temperature of quantum degeneracy of the trapped sample as a whole , @xmath3 is the total number of particles , and @xmath4 is the axial trap frequency .",
    "our main results show how ` fermionization ' can be readily detected through a simple measurement of the pair correlation averaged over the trap .",
    "this is very close to the correlation at the trap center as predicted @xcite using the lieb - liniger uniform model , and in principle can be measured via photoassociation of trapped atoms , or other related two - body inelastic processes whose rates are governed by the local pair correlations @xcite .",
    "in addition , an indirect measure of the pair correlations can be obtained @xcite via the measurement of three - body recombination rates as recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "one dimensional quantum field theories have the important and useful property that they are often exactly solvable .",
    "this is not generally the case for higher - dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "thus , the study of these 1d models can lead to an insight into the nature of quantum field theory for interacting particles , that is not possible from the usual perturbative approaches . in this section , we review the physics of these exact solutions for interacting bosons in the uniform 1d case , and introduce the theoretical framework for treating a non - uniform gas within the local density approximation .",
    "the study of exact solutions for the one - dimensional bose gas started with girardeau s seminal work @xcite on hard - core , or impenetrable bosons . in this model",
    ", there is a remarkable and exact correspondence between the measurable correlation functions of free fermions , and those of strongly interacting bosons . in the @xmath0",
    "bose gas model with a delta - function interaction , solved by lieb and liniger @xcite , the particles can pass through each other , so they are no longer impenetrable .",
    "this provides a realistic description of a wave - guide with transverse dimensions larger than the ` core ' of a particle in the wave - guide . under these circumstances",
    ", there may only be a single relevant transverse mode , yet particles are able to exchange their positions as they propagate past each other .",
    "thus , we start by reviewing the theory of a gas of @xmath3 bosons interacting via a delta - function potential in one dimension .",
    "the @xmath0 bose gas has a short - range repulsive interaction between particles which is characterized by just one coupling constant . in second quantization",
    ", the hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bosonic field operator , @xmath7 is the atom mass , @xmath8 is the coupling constant , and @xmath9 is the trapping potential which we assume is harmonic with @xmath10 , while @xmath4 is the trap oscillation frequency in the axial direction . to treat the uniform gas we set @xmath11 .    for bose gases in highly elongated cylindrical traps ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the frequency of the transverse harmonic potential ) such that the sample can be described by the above @xmath0 model",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath14 is expressed through the @xmath15 scattering length @xmath16 @xcite . for a positive scattering length @xmath16 which is much smaller than the amplitude of transverse ( @xmath17-direction ) zero point oscillations , or the transverse harmonic oscillator length ,",

    "one finds that for fulfilling this requirement it is sufficient to satisfy the inequalities @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath0 ( linear ) density in the center of the trap , @xmath26 .",
    "we now give a brief overview of the uniform ( @xmath11 ) bose gas problem describing a gas of @xmath3 bosons interacting via a pair - wise repulsive delta - function potential in a @xmath0 box of length @xmath27 with periodic boundary condition @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath3 , @xmath28 , while the @xmath0 linear density @xmath29 is kept constant ) , the solution to the energy eigenstates is found @xcite using the bethe ansatz @xcite . in this solution ,",

    "the reason is that these correlations , in particular the two - particle correlation @xmath129 , are determined by the contribution of excitations which have energies of the order of the chemical potential and wavelength of the order of @xmath22 .",
    "however , this is not the case for all correlation functions .",

    "[ lda - criterion ] ) the ` weak ' lda criterion .",
    "however , within the lda , no correlation function can be calculated reliably over distance scales that are comparable to the sample size .",
    "thus , the ` weak ' criterion of validity of the lda requires that variations of the density occur on a length scale that is much larger than @xmath115 , in which case the gas is treated locally as a piece of a uniform gas . from the definition of @xmath130",
    ", one can easily see that the lda is easier to satisfy in the center of the trap where the density profile is almost flat than near the tails of the distribution where the density drops rapidly .",
    "however , for measurements that average over an entire trap , it is the central region that plays the most important role .",
    "here , we analyze the implications of the lda criterion ( [ lda - criterion ] ) for a zero temperature gas . at @xmath23 , a uniform @xmath0 bose gas can be characterized by a single dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath52 , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) . depending on its value ,",
    "one has two well - known and physically distinct regimes of quantum degeneracy . for @xmath54 ,",
    "i.e. at weak couplings or high densities , the gas is in a coherent or gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) regime . in this regime ,",
    "long - range order is destroyed by long - wavelength phase fluctuations @xcite and the equilibrium state is a quasi - condensate characterized by suppressed density fluctuations . for strong couplings or low densities , @xmath131 , the gas reaches the strongly interacting or tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime and undergoes `` fermionization '' @xcite .",
    "the term `` fermionization '' is used here in the sense that the wave function strongly decreases as particles approach each other .    for a trapped ( non - uniform ) gas one can introduce a local interaction parameter @xmath132 which changes with the density distribution @xmath119 and can be used for characterizing the local properties of the gas .    from the definition of @xmath133 it is clear that as one moves from the center of the trap towards the tails of the density distribution where @xmath134 , the gas either enters the tg regime where @xmath135 , or else the lda itself breaks down .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath23 case the lieb - liniger solution within the lda gives a density profile that vanishes [ @xmath136 beyond a certain distance @xmath137 from the origin @xcite .",
    "this distance is called the thomas - fermi radius and it is determined from the condition @xmath138 which gives : @xmath139    since @xmath119 vanishes exactly at @xmath140 @xcite , it is clear that the lda criterion ( [ lda - criterion ] ) can only be satisfied up to a certain maximum distance from the trap center @xmath141 , displaced from @xmath137 by @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "we would like therefore to determine the displacement @xmath142 such that the lda is valid for @xmath144 and breaks down beyond @xmath141 .    as we are interested in calculating the density profiles and the local two - particle correlation function , we will only focus on the ` weak ' lda criterion , eq .

    "first , we rewrite the inhomogeneity length scale from eq .",

    "<S> we calculate the density profiles and density correlation functions of the one - dimensional bose gas in a harmonic trap , using the exact finite - temperature solutions for the uniform case , and applying a local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the results are valid for a trapping potential which is slowly varying relative to a correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> they allow a direct experimental test of the transition from the weak coupling gross - pitaevskii regime to the strong coupling , ` fermionic ' tonks - girardeau regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the average two - particle correlation which characterizes the bulk properties of the sample , and find that it can be well approximated by the value of the local pair correlation in the trap center . </S>"
