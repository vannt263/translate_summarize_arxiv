    "recent experiments by the weizmann group have stirred much attention to the phase that electrons acquire when they traverse a quantum dot ( qd ) embedded in the arm of a aharonov - bohm interferometer.@xcite these fascinating measurements call for a deeper understanding of electron transport through a strongly interacting object . if many electrons  say @xmath2  populate a qd , the transmission phase @xmath3 of the tunneling electron displays a much studied@xcite universal behavior : first @xmath3 increases by @xmath0 through the conductance peak and then it lapses in the coulomb valley . here",
    "we focus on the relatively less studied few - electron regime , where the phase evolution depends on @xmath4 . in the samples studied in ref .",
    "the phase remains constant in the @xmath5 valley , independently from qd tunings , whereas it lapses in the coulomb blockaded devices of ref .  .",
    "for @xmath6 the phase is not reproducible and shows both increments and lapses , likely due to qd shape and exchange effects.@xcite    in spite of several explanations of the few - electron scenario@xcite a clear picture is still missing .",
    "many works introduced major simplifications , like spinless electrons,@xcite one - dimensional qds,@xcite simplified models for coulomb interaction,@xcite or other _ ad hoc _",
    "assumptions.@xcite even the interpretation of the simplest @xmath7 transition is controversial , being variably attributed to the occupation of either the same@xcite or a different@xcite orbital from that of the first electron , to the role of excited doorway channels,@xcite to electron crystallization.@xcite    in this paper we compute @xmath3 by fully including exchange and correlation effects .",
    "the theory is based on the application of the friedel sum rule ( fsr ) as generalized in ref .   to a multiorbital interacting qd  an exact zero - temperature result , @xmath8 .",
    "since the fsr holds for non degenerate ground states ( gss ) only,@xcite it may be applied to either singlet kondo gss at zero field , @xmath9 , or non - degenerate gss in the coulomb blockade regime ( @xmath10 for singlets and @xmath11 for doublets and higher - spin states ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that , in the conductance valleys with odd @xmath4 at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the qd is always in the kondo regime . in order to reach the coulomb blockade regime by keeping @xmath8",
    ", one needs to apply the field to the aharonov - bohm ring to destroy dot - lead kondo correlations , hence removing qd spin degeneracy.@xcite this condition is reached when @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the bohr magneton and @xmath14 the qd level width . in the experiments the temperature is very low ( @xmath15 mk ) and",
    "the field is relatively weak ( @xmath16 mt ) .",
    "therefore , in order to compare measurements with the theoretical predictions reported in this paper , tiny widths @xmath14 are required , which are actually smaller than the values presently reported.@xcite    as anticipated above , the theory relies on the application of the fsr .",
    "the key idea is that the phase variation @xmath17 for the addition of one electron to the qd is given by integrating the qd spectral density @xmath18 between two consecutive conductance valleys ( with @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is evaluated exactly for an isolated qd via full configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations@xcite with @xmath20 .",

    "additionaly , ( iii ) in the coulomb ( kondo ) regime the increment @xmath22 through the conductance peak is significantly smaller than @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) as a consequence of strong coulomb correlation .",
    "the theory fails to reproduce the coulomb blockade results of ref .  .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is presently unclear , but it is likely related to the significant departure from the condition ruling the range of applicability of the theory , i.e. , @xmath12 at @xmath8 . in order to treat the coulomb blockade regime even at @xmath9 , one could compute the thermal green function of the fully correlated system at @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the kondo temperature .",
