    "interest in ferromagnetic shape memory alloys ( fsmas ) due to their technological potential have generated much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "these alloys have the generic formula x@xmath8yz where the x and y atoms are 3d elements while z is a group iiia - va element .",
    "they undergo a diffusionless transformation from high temperature austenitic cubic structure to low temperature ( martensitic ) tetragonal or orthorhombic structure @xcite .",
    "one such system extensively studied is ni@xmath8mnga which undergoes martensitic transformation at t@xmath9 @xmath10 220k .",
    "martensitic transformation can also be induced in z = in , sn or sb but in off - stoichiometric compositions , ni@xmath0mn@xmath1z@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "apart from the martensitic transformation these alloys exhibit other interesting properties like large magnetocaloric effects , magnetic superelasticity @xcite and magnetic field induced giant strains @xcite , exchange bias @xcite etc .",
    "alloys of the type mn@xmath8niz have higher mn content compared to the traditional ni@xmath8mnz and is considered beneficial in realizing better magnetic , magnetocaloric and magnetotransport properties @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath8niga is one such mn rich alloy which undergoes martensitic transformation at t@xmath9 @xmath10 270 k in an ferrimagnetically ordered state ( t@xmath11 = 588k ) @xcite .",
    "ferrimagnetic order has also been confirmed from band structure calculations and arise due to unequal magnetic moments of antiferromagnetically coupled mn atoms occupying the x and y sites of x@xmath8yz heusler structure @xcite .",
    "although martensitic transformations have been theoretically predicted in other mn@xmath8niz ( z = in , sn , sb ) alloys , experimental investigations have reported these alloys to have stable crystal structures @xcite .",
    "however , just as in case of ni@xmath8mnz alloys wherein martensitic instability is caused by partial substitution of z atoms by mn , increasing of ni content at the expense of z atoms in mn@xmath8niz results in martensitic alloys @xcite .",
    "however , realization of such alloys with general composition mn@xmath8ni@xmath1z@xmath2 can lead to a structural disorder due to site preferences of transition metal ions . in a l2@xmath12 heusler composition ni atoms prefer x sites as compared to z sites @xcite and therefore doping excess ni could result in newer magnetic interactions as it would force mn to occupy the z sites .",
    "these conditions can change the sign of rkky interaction leading to magnetic frustration or a new type of magnetic order .",
    "local structural disorder is shown to be primarily responsible for martensitic transformation and magnetic interactions in the martensitic state of ni@xmath8mn@xmath13in@xmath14 type alloys @xcite . in case of mn@xmath8niga",
    "as well , site occupancy disorder has been shown to be an important factor in explaining magnetic properties of the martensitic state@xcite . the antisite disorder is also shown to be responsible for the zero field cooled exchange bias in mn@xmath8ptga @xcite .    in this paper we focus our attention on understanding the magnetic properties of mn@xmath0ni@xmath1in@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 ) and mn@xmath4ni@xmath5in@xmath6 ( @xmath15 ) type alloys especially in their martensitic state .",
    "by comparing the magnetic properties of martensitic and structurally stable alloys having nearly similar compositions , we show that low temperature magnetic properties of the martensitic alloys are dominated by ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , arising due to site occupancy disorder in these mn rich alloys .",
    "the samples of above composition were prepared by arc melting the weighed constituents in argon atmosphere followed by encapsulating in a evacuated quartz tube and annealing at 750 c for 48 hours and subsequent quenching in ice cold water .",
    "the prepared alloys were cut in suitable sizes using a low speed diamond saw and part of the sample was powdered and re - annealed in the same procedure above .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were recorded at room temperature in the angular range of @xmath16 .",
    "resistivity was measured by standard four probe technique using a closed cycle helium refrigerator in the temperature range from 10 k to 330k .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed in the temperature interval 5 k - 400 k using a squid magnetometer . here",
    "the samples were first cooled from room temperature to 5k in zero applied magnetic field and the data was recorded while warming ( zfc ) followed by cooling ( fcc ) and subsequent warming ( fcw ) in the same applied field of 100 oe . for high temperature magnetization",
    "vibrating sample magnetometer was employed in the temperature range of 300 k - 700 k. isothermal magnetization m(h ) at various temperatures were recorded by ramping the field in the range @xmath178 t in all five quadrants .",
    "all the m(h ) loops were recorded by cooling the samples from room temperature to the desired temperature in zero applied field .",

    "therefore an increase in ni concentration will lead to more mn occupying z sites resulting in an antisite disorder .",
    "such an antisite disorder is known to induce competing magnetic interactions result in a complex magnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "indeed , the martensitic state of these alloys exhibit strongly competing magnetic interactions . in order to determine",
    "if site preferences of various atoms is responsible for the observed magnetic ground state , we compare the values of magnetic moment at 300k in mn@xmath8ni@xmath18in@xmath6 and its ni rich ( @xmath7 = 0.04 and 0.08 ) and ni deficient ( @xmath7 = -0.04 and -0.08 ) counterparts .",
    "though both ni deficient and ni deficient alloys have similar ferrimagnetic ordering temperature , a comparison of m(h ) loops at 300k shows that magnetic moment measured at 7 t in mn@xmath32ni@xmath33in@xmath6 ( @xmath1032 emu / g ) is less than half of that in mn@xmath8ni@xmath18in@xmath6 ( @xmath1080 emu / g ) .",
    "such a large decrease in the value of magnetic moment can only be accounted for by considering a strong antiferromagnetic component coming from a sizable fraction of mn occupying z sites .",
    "the sizable shift of mn atoms at z sites reduces its occupancy of x sites .",
    "such a site occupancy disorder results in increasing the dominance of both , ferromagnetic interaction between mn atoms in y sublattice and antiferromagnetic interactions between mn(y ) and mn(z ) atoms .",
    "such a competition then gives rise to the observed strong exchange bias effect .",
    "in summary , we have presented a systematic study of the martensitic and magnetic interactions in heusler alloys of the type mn@xmath8ni@xmath1in@xmath2 and mn@xmath4ni@xmath5in@xmath6 .",
    "martensitic instability can be induced by increasing ni content at the expense of in .",
    "such a increase in ni content results in a site occupancy disorder due to preferential occupation of x sites by ni atoms forcing mn atoms to occupy the z sites .",
    "this results in a transformation of magnetic ground state from ferrimagnetic to one dominated by presence of ferromagnetic mn(y)-mn(y ) and antiferromagnetic mn(y)-mn(z ) interactions .",
    "such a transition is responsible for observation of properties like exchange bias effect in zero field cooled state in these mn rich martensitic alloys .",
