    "hydrogenation of carbon nanostructures is recently attracting a lot of interest as a methodology that allows for the tuning of their mechanical , electronic , and magnetic properties .",
    "in contrast to direct manipulation of the carbon atoms , e.g. , creating vacancies @xcite or reshaping edges @xcite , hydrogenation can effectively affect the electronic properties in a similar manner with the advantage that is a reversible process .",
    "for instance , hydrogenation of graphene was found , both theoretically and experimentally , to be a way to turn graphene from a gapless semiconductor into a gapful one with a tunable band gap @xcite .",
    "it has also been predicted that partial hydrogenation may induce interesting magnetic properties in graphene with potential applications in spintronics @xcite .",
    "for instance , h - induced ferromagnetism is expected under some very particular conditions @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on hydrogenated or fluorinated graphene , however , do not show evidence of ferromagnetism , but rather of paramagnetic behaviour @xcite .",
    "many calculations related to the adsorption of h atoms on graphene have been reported in the literature , mostly being based on first - principles or density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "all the reports coincide in that adsorptive carbon atoms are puckered and , most importantly , that the covalent bond between carbon and h leads to magnetic moments on neighboring carbon atoms totalling 1.0 @xmath0@xcite .",
    "such spin polarization is mainly localized around the adsorptive carbon atom .",
    "the magnetic coupling between h atoms adsorbed on graphene has also been studied and basically follows the rules expected from lieb s theorem @xcite .",
    "graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms bonded together in a bipartite honeycomb structure .",
    "it is thus formed by two interpenetrating triangular sublattices , a and b , such that the nearest neighbors of an atom a belong to the sublattice b and vice versa @xcite .",
    "three different magnetic states can be triggered by a h pair , namely , non - magnetic , ferromagnetic , and antiferromagnetic .",
    "the most energetically stable configuration corresponds to having both h atoms adsorbed on two nearest - neighbor carbon atoms , leading to a non - magnetic ground state @xcite . when both h atoms are on the same sublattice they are coupled ferromagnetically with total spin @xmath1 .",
    "when the pair of h atoms is adsorbed on different sublattices , but sufficiently far away from each other , they induce magnetic moments that couple antiferromagnetically ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . as we show here , for similar distances between the h atoms the ferromagnetic coupling is always favored over the antiferromagnetic one .",
    "previous calculations for vacancy - induced magnetism in graphene have shown similar results as long as the vacancies do not reconstruct @xcite",
    ".    concerning graphite , a few experimental studies , not free from controversy , have reported changes in the magnetic properties produced by irradiation of the graphite sample .",
    "the results show that graphite can become ferromagnetic at room temperature out of an originally non - magnetic sample .",
    "the ferromagnetic state appears at low concentration of the impurities induced by the irradiation and is independent of the irradiation ion type used @xcite . unlike the case of graphene , not many theoretical studies have been reported in the literature on the magnetic properties of irradiated or hydrogenated graphite .",
    "yazyev@xcite , for instance , has studied the magnetic properties of hydrogenated graphite using a combination of mean - field hubbard model and first - principles calculations .",
    "he obtained , as expected , that the sublattices are inequivalent ( approx .",
    "0.16 ev ) for hydrogenation in bulk .",
    "graphite is a semi - metal composed of stacked graphene layers .",
    "the typical bernal stacking of these planes effectively breaks sublattice symmetry : a atoms ( for instance ) are located exactly above and below the atoms of neighboring planes ( * @xmath3 * atoms from now on ) while b atoms are located at the center of the hexagonal rings of the neighboring planes ( * @xmath4 * atoms)@xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with hydrogenation of the surface of graphite .",
    "first , through dft calculations , we revisit the energetics of a h pair on graphene .",
    "we confirm previous results and , by considering very large supercells , we find the expected antiferromagnetic state when h atoms are adsorbed sufficiently far apart from each other on different sublattices . next we present results for the adsorption energies on different sublattices for bilayer and multilayer graphene . both sets of results",
    "are then combined to estimate the maximum average concentration for which all h atoms may occupy the same sublattice and , thereby , will be coupled ferromagnetically .",
    "we also compute the exchange coupling constants as a function of the relative distance between h atoms .",
    "finally , we present a study of the curie temperature in this system based on a ising model constructed with the dft coupling constants .",
    "our results support the possible existence of surface sublattice - polarized hydrogenation and concomitant ferromagnetism .",
    "our calculations are based on the dft framework@xcite as implemented in the siesta code @xcite .",
    "we are mostly interested here in multilayer graphene and graphite where dispersion ( van der waals ) forces due to long - range electron correlation effects play a key role in the binding of the graphene layers .",
    "therefore we use the exchange and correlation nonlocal van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) of dion et al .",
    "@xcite as implemented by romn - prez and soler @xcite . to describe the interaction between the valence and core electrons we used norm - conserved troullier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "to expand the wavefunctions of the valence electrons a double-@xmath5 plus polarization ( dzp ) basis set was used @xcite .",
    "we experimented with a variety of basis sets and found that , for both graphene and graphite , the dzp produced high - quality results .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff energy for the wavefunctions was set to 500 ryd . for the brillouin zone sampling we use @xmath6 monkhorst - pack ( mp )",
    "@xmath7-mesh for the largest @xmath8 single - layer and for the bilayer graphene supercells .",
    "we have also checked that the results are well converged with respect to the real space grid . regarding the atomic structure ,",
    "the atoms are allowed to relax down to a force tolerance of 0.005 ev /  .",
    "all supercells are large enough to ensure that the vacuum space is at least 25  so that the interaction between functionalized graphene layers and their periodic images is safely avoided .",
    "spin polarization was included in the calculations because , as discussed in the introduction , hydrogenation is known to induce magnetism in single - layer and , possibly , also in bilayer and multilayer graphene .",
    "we begin our study by optimizing the geometric structures of the monolayer , bilayer graphene , and graphite in their natural nonmagnetic state .",
    "the c - c bond lengths and cell parameters ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and the interlayer distances between the layers ( @xmath11 ) are listed in table ( [ table : structure ] ) .",

    "our results show that the adsorption of h atoms on a graphite surface may induce , at low concentrations , ferromagnetically coupled spin densities distributed around the adsorbed h atoms . in the diluted regime ,",
    "the extension of the polarization cloud may be considered small compared to the mean distance between h atoms ; therefore , to study the collective magnetic properties of the system we will use the following ising - like model hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two discrete spin variables ( @xmath15 ) at sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 of a given sublattice ( say @xmath18 ) of the graphite surface .",
    "the random variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the occupation of one carbon atom with a h atom .",

    ", we have performed simulations at very low concentrations @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 means full coverage of the graphite surface with h atoms ) .",
    "note also that our simulations are performed in the range @xmath42 .",

    "the abrupt supression of @xmath43 signals the approximate value of the ordering or curie temperature @xmath47 .",
    "however , this ordering temperature seems to increase with the system size . in the thermodynamic limit this behavior extrapolates to an infinite value ( i.e. , a finite magnetization at any finite temperature ) .",
    "we discuss now that this is an intrinsic property of the system , consequence of the long - range coupling between the induced magnetic moments .",
    "to study this we compute the binder cumulant , used conventionally for an accurate determination of the critical temperature in mc simulations of statistical systems .",

    "the finite - size scaling argument states that , close to a critical point , a thermal average of a generic quantity scales as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the system size , @xmath54 a critical exponent , and @xmath55 is the temperature dependent correlation length which can be considered adimensional or in units of @xmath9 .",
    "close to the critical point , it scales as @xmath56 .",
    "it is well known that several physical properties have important finite size corrections which makes the determination of @xmath47 difficult .",

    "if a system has a well - defined second order phase transition at a finite temperature , the finite - size analysis of the binder parameter @xmath61 will show a family of decreasing functions of the temperature , all of them crossing , to a very good approximation , at @xmath47 .",

    "[ binder - cumulant - vs - t - for - c ] ) which makes it impossible to define a critical temperature .",

    "[ binder - cumulant - vs - t - for - lc ] , and [ tatbc05-vs - l ] admit a simple interpretation : if the system is going to have a well - defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit and the binder cumulant analysis is going to be an accurate method to determine it , the coupling constant has to be rescaled with the size of system @xmath67 which redefines a coupling constant with units of energy . without such rescaling the binder cumulant analysis results in no crossing points ( see fig .",
    "[ binder - cumulant - vs - t - for - c ] ) .",
    "this behavior is very common in systems with long - range couplings .",
    "a very illustrating example is the infinite - range ising model ( see for instance @xcite ) , where the coupling constant has to be rescaled with the total number of spins to achieve a well - defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit . in our model",

    "the effective coupling of a single spin connected by a @xmath38 interactions to the rest of the spins in the system is @xmath68 in other words , the effective coupling of the system increases linearly as its size increases .",
    "this is in contrast with a system with a finite coordination number where @xmath69 is size independent . here",
    "we have assumed the continuum limit , a circular sample , and we have replaced the stochastic variable @xmath20 by its mean value @xmath70 .",
    "we can remove these assumptions by evaluating numerically the effective coupling @xmath69 in the triangular discrete lattice with a random population of hydrogen atoms distributed with the probability density ( [ probability_density ] ) : @xmath71 which , averaged over all the sites @xmath16 of the lattice , also scales as @xmath63 in the limit of large cell size @xmath72 .",
