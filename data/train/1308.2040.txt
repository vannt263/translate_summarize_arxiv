    "the finite - size scaling theory , introduced by fisher , finds extensive applications in the analysis of experimental , monte carlo , and transfer - matrix data , as well as in recent theoretical developments related to conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "exact solutions on the ising model have been used to determine the form of finite - size scaling .",
    "exact results of the model on finite sizes with various boundaries have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge has been obtained for the torus case @xcite , for helical boundary conditions @xcite , for brascamp - kunz boundary conditions @xcite and for infinitely long cylinder@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model has been studied very intensively .",
    "however the solution for a 2d system with free boundaries , i.e. , with free edges and sharp corners , is difficult and not well studied up to now . although there are monte carlo and transfer matrix studies on this problem @xcite , the accuracy , or the system sizes achieved , is not enough to extract the finite - size corrections . meanwhile , for 2d critical systems , a huge amount of knowledge has been obtained by the application of the powerful techniques of integrability and conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "cardy and peschel predicted that the next sub - dominant contribution to the free energy on a square comes from the corners @xcite , which is universal , and related to the central charge @xmath5 in the continuum limit . along this direction , boundary conformal field theory has been studied intensively to treat critical systems with free boundaries in recent years @xcite .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in our understanding of logarithmic conformal field theory @xcite , of the kondo effect @xcite , of the physics of quantum impurities or the fermi edge singularity @xcite , of local and global quenches in one - dimensional quantum systems @xcite , and , in the relationship between conformal field theory and the schramm loewner evolution formalism @xcite .",
    "however , till now there is few studies on lattice model , say ising model , with free boundary condition to compare with the cft results .",
    "recently there appear two successful approaches to solve the 2d ising model with free boundaries .",
    "vernier and jacobsen @xcite conjectured an exact analytic formula for the corner free energy of the ising model on the square lattice .",
    "the asymptotic behavior upon approaching the critical temperature is shown to be consistent with cft results .",
    "the other way is to use the bond propagation ( bp ) algorithm , which was developed for computing the partition function of the ising model in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is much faster than monte carlo simulation , and costs moderate memory comparing with the transfer matrix method .",
    "very large system size can be reached . with this algorithm ,",
    "the calculations have been carried out on square and triangular lattices with free boundaries @xcite .",
    "the results of free energy are surprisingly accurate to @xmath0 .",
    "fitting the assumed finite - size scaling formula to the data , the edge and corner terms were obtained very accurately .",
    "for example , from the corner term on the square lattice with rectangle shape @xcite , the central charge of ising model was estimated as @xmath6 , compared with the cft result @xmath7 @xcite .    in the previous work @xcite , the critical internal energy and specific heat",
    "have also been studied by numerical differentiation of free energy @xcite",
    ". however , the numerical differentiation process limits the accuracy to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , which is much lower than that of the free energy .",
    "therefore the authors could not determine the accurate expansion form for the internal energy and specific heat .",
    "for example , the authors could not extract the logarithmic correction at the third and fourth order in the expansions .",
    "in this paper we use the bp algorithm for internal energy and specific heat , rather than differentiation method , to study the critical internal energy and specific heat on the square and triangular lattices with free boundaries . the @xmath8 transformation in bp algorithm for internal energy",
    "was given by loh et.al @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we derive the bp series reduction for the internal energy , and make the algorithm completed .",
    "we also develop the bp algorithm for specific heat .",
    "using these algorithms , the accuracy of internal energy and specific heat reaches the same level as that of free energy , which is @xmath0 . fitting to these results",
    ", we obtain very accurate expansion of the internal energy and specific heat .",
    "the accurate expansions is helpful to the cft and renormalization group ( rg ) study on this kind of problem @xcite .    for the square lattice , the rectangular shape with size @xmath9",
    "are studied .",
    "five aspect ratios @xmath10 are investigated .",
    "it is shown that the edge and corner internal energy are independent of aspect ratio , and there is no logarithmic correction term of order higher than @xmath11 . for the triangular lattice ,",
    "five shapes : triangular , rhomboid , trapezoid , hexagonal and rectangular , are studied .",
    "the logarithmic corrections terms @xmath12 are found in the internal energy density , and logarithmic correction terms @xmath13 are found in the specific heat for the rhomboid , trapezoid and hexagonal shape , while there are no such terms for the triangular and rectangular shape .",
    "the exact values of some edge and corner terms are conjectured with the help of high accurate data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we derive the bp algorithm for the specific heat section ii . in section iii , we give the result of internal energy and specific heat for the square lattice in rectangular shape . in section iv , we present results for the triangular lattice in five shapes .",
    "we summarize in section v.",
    "the partition function of the ising model on a 2d lattice is @xmath14 where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the homogeneous couplings .",
    "the free energy density is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the total free energy and number of spins or the area of the system respectively .",
    "the internal energy and specific heat density can be computed from @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the total internal energy and heat capacity .",
    "note here the definition of internal energy is different from the ordinary one in the sign .    along the the same route as the bp algorithm for the internal energy in reference @xcite",
