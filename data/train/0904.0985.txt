    "the physics of charm mesons has been long studied for its own interesting phenomenology , as the first heavy quark .",
    "but it was , until recently , less prized for insight into weak flavor physics than the study of @xmath0 physics , involving the yet heavier but still accessible @xmath1 quark .",
    "the higher energy scale afforded @xmath0 physics a firmer theoretical base , and the surprising suppression of the leading @xmath2 decay process allows for strong displays of @xmath3 violation and neutral meson mixing . in the case of charm ,",
    "less interesting cabibbo - allowed decays dominate , making it hard to see rare processes .",
    "charm @xmath3 violation is generally suppressed in the standard model , as is @xmath4 mixing , which is also complicated by uncertain long - distance contributions .",
    "experimental results are in general harder to interpret since charm is light , making calculations of qcd effects difficult .",
    "the `` brown muck '' of strong - interaction physics obscures the weak physics of interest .",
    "of course , not all was bleak ; there were opportunities beyond mere cataloging of charm decays .",
    "one looked for unexpected surprises , or exploited the benefits of using charm to limit new physics in the light of small standard model backgrounds .",
    "however , a new communal wisdom began to emerge not long ago , that charm is a gift with many uses @xcite .",
    "much of the activity in weak flavor physics involves precision measurements to over - constrain the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "an inconsistency would signal new physics , and searching for such indirect evidence complements direct searches for new particles at the energy frontier .",
    "@xmath0 physics experiments are the most fertile ground for these studies ; they are very productive and precise , but too often limited by theory .",
    "ckm constraints are often shown as bands in a two - dimensional ( @xmath5 ) plane , and the widths of many of these constraint bands are limited by theory .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) provides a systematic path to lift such limitations in using @xmath0 results , and charm physics can be used to directly test lqcd .",
    "of course , this is not all that charm has to offer .",
    "recently , multiple consistent observations of @xmath4 mixing have enlivened this topic , as only discovery can . and",
    "analyses of charm meson dalitz plots provide a useful tool not only for low - energy hadronic spectroscopy , but are in fact also helpful for improving precision of weak @xmath0 physics results , in particular for the ckm angle @xmath6 .    here , we concentrate on precision branching fractions results which impact weak flavor physics , though we discuss some other interesting hadronic modes at the end . in particular , the increased precision of leptonic and semi - leptonic results provides a testbed for modern lqcd .",
    "if it passes , we add confidence in lqcd predictions and uncertainty estimates for @xmath0 physics , where they are a critically needed compliment to pre - existing measurements of @xmath0 mixing and exclusive @xmath0 semileptonic decays .",
    "leptonic decays of @xmath7 are used to extract decay constants and the semileptonic processes @xmath8 constrain form - factors .",
    "golden - mode branching ratios for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 solidify the overall normalization of charm decays .",
    "precision lifetimes , now dominated by focus @xcite results , are also an important input to connect theoretical partial widths to expected branching fractions .",
    "relevant experimental techniques include tagging with near - threshold @xmath12 pairs at cleo - c and high - statistics 10 gev data from @xmath0 factories which allows for what we call `` continuum tagging '' .",
    "many results have been obtained with @xmath13 collisions at threshold by cleo - c . for @xmath12 mesons , machine energies",
    "are set to produce @xmath14 , while for @xmath15 , one uses @xmath13 collision at 4170 mev to produce @xmath16 at the @xmath17 , the @xmath12-pair cross - section is @xmath18 nb @xcite , while at 4170 mev , @xmath19 nb @xcite .",
    "these desired processes are in addition to a light - quark ( @xmath20 ) continuum cross - section of order 20 nb , plus tau pairs , radiative returns to the narrow @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and two - photon reactions . but note that charm mesons at 3770 mev appear _ only _ as @xmath23 pairs , with no room for even one fragmentation pion . on the other hand , data at 4170 mev also includes @xmath24 , and a small amount of @xmath25 in addition to the desired @xmath26 ( which is chosen due to a larger cross - section relative to the simpler @xmath27 ) .",
    "kinematics can still cleanly separate these different possibilities at 4170 mev , but the other charm and lower cross - section for the process of interest does lead to more combinatorics and decreased signal - to - noise in the @xmath15 case .    a `` tag '' is simply a fully - reconstructed @xmath7 hadronic decay . a sample of tagged events has greatly reduced background and constrained kinematics , both of which aid studies of how the other @xmath7 in the event decays .",
    "one can infer neutrinos from energy and momentum conservation , allowing `` full '' reconstruction of ( semi)leptonic decays . for hadronic branching fractions",
    ", some simple algebra will serve to demonstrate how tagged samples can provide a clean absolute normalization .",
    "the typical tag rates per @xmath7 ( _ not _ per pair ) are roughly 15% , 10% , and 5% for @xmath28 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "cleo - c completed data - taking in spring , 2008 , and is in the process of updating many results to the full statistics . in the meantime",
    ", the besiii experiment at the bepcii collider has begun its commissioning run , and their plans are to extend these methods even further .    belle has developed tag - based techniques for use with continuum charm production from the @xmath29 region , near 10 gev . with hundreds of times",
    "greater charm samples , one can afford to use selected favorable semi - exclusive states which are only a small fraction of the total .",
    "this technique is exploited by belle for ( semi)leptonic decays .",
    "partial reconstruction techniques may be used to study charm produced in @xmath0 decays , a production mechanism with a rate similar to the @xmath30 continuum .",
    "a precision branching fraction result from babar is featured to illustrate these techniques .",
    "we will see that @xmath31 tagging of @xmath12 mesons is no longer the main workhorse .",
    "decay constants characterize the strong - interaction physics at the quark - annihilation vertex , in our case @xmath32 . in a fully leptonic decay , they parameterize all of our essential theoretical limitations . decay constants also appear in the evaluation of box diagrams , and limit theoretical precision in calculating the neutral meson mixing .",
    "thus , lack of knowledge of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays constants limits the usefulness of precise measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath36 oscillations .",
    "these mixing data are our best source of information on the ckm matrix elements @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which are difficult to measure directly in top decay .",
    "the charm sector presents an opportunity to check lqcd results for decay constants against precision measurements .",
    "this is desirable since the only related direct measurement possible , the decay constant of the @xmath39 from measurement of @xmath40 , is very challenging .",
    "let us first review the status in the spring of 2008 .",
    "previous cleo and belle results for @xmath15 leptonic decays averaged to give @xmath41 mev @xcite .",
    "the best precision claimed for lqcd , with 2 + 1 unquenched flavors , finds @xmath42 mev @xcite , about a three standard - deviation discrepancy . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath43 results are consistent with lqcd .",
    "a 2005 cleo @xmath44 result of @xmath45 mev from 281 pb@xmath46 @xcite , is consistent with a recent lqcd value of @xmath47 mev @xcite .",
    "however , in both cases , more experimental precision is clearly needed .",
    "we also await more lqcd results , to confirm the quoted results .",
    "while these results have the best claimed precision , they involve a somewhat controversial technique involving a `` fourth - root trick '' using computationally - efficient staggered fermions .",
    "further details and other competing lattice results may be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most , but not all , have similar central values ; they have larger errors due primarily to computational limitations with more traditional ( but also more generally accepted ) lqcd techniques .",
    "dobrescu and kronfeld @xcite argue that the disagreement on @xmath48 could be the effect of new physics , mentioning both charged higgs ( their own model ) and leptoquarks as possibilities .",
    "kundu and nandi suggest @xcite @xmath49-parity violating susy to explain a large @xmath50 and the @xmath34 mixing phase .",
    "there are now newer experimental results to report on .",
    "we first present a preliminary cleo - c @xmath51 update using the full 818 pb@xmath46 of @xmath17 data @xcite .",

    "@xmath12 decay diagrams can produce both @xmath202 and @xmath203 ; these interfere in physical @xmath204 , @xmath170 final states , which leads to a @xmath170 , @xmath204 asymmetry @xcite .",

    "this is the first observation of a charmed meson decaying into a baryon - antibaryon final state .",
    "many recent experimental charm results have been reviewed , and the progress of recent years is continuing .",
    "tests of lattice qcd are becoming more becoming precise , and there is currently an intriguing disagreement for @xmath50 even as @xmath112 matches very well .",
    "charm threshold data is generally best for experimental precision , but significant contributions are also made by other experiments .",
    "much existing data is left to mine at babar , belle , and cleo . very soon",
