    "it is a well - known consequence of the slavnov - taylor identity that the ratio of vertex renormalization factor to wave - function renormalization factor is _ universal _ : @xmath5 where the denominators @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the wave - function renormalization factors of gauge - boson , faddeev - popov ghost and matter field @xmath9 , respectively , and the numerators @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the gauge - boson vertex renormalization factors of those fields .",

    "and then in sect .",
    "3 we give a proof of the relation ( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "some implications are discussed in sect .  4 , where i give an argument that the confinement condition @xmath4 implies the disappearance of the massless ( vector ) gauge boson pole .",
    "it , therefore , turns to imply that a certain  local gauge symmetry \" is dynamically restored as was discussed by hata@xcite .",
    "this is explained in sect .",
    "5 . the final sect .  6",
    "is devoted to some further discussions .",
    "let us first recapitulate how the condition @xmath4 is related to the color confinement@xcite .",
    "as noted by ojima@xcite first , the equation of motion for the gauge field can be written in the following form of maxwell - type : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the noether current of color symmetry ( global gauge symmetry ) .",
    "the point is that the noether current always has an _ arbitrariness _ adding a term of the form @xmath21}$ ] with an arbitrary local anti - symmetric tensor @xmath22}$ ] .",
    "that is , the modified current @xmath23}$ ] is still conserved and , moreover , the corresponding charge generates the infinitesimal color rotation correctly on any field operators ( at least with formal application of canonical commutation relations ) .",
    "we have , therefore , a possibility to define the color charge @xmath24 by @xmath25 if we _ could _ define the color charge by this equation , then it takes a brs - exact form and so the color confinement is concluded : indeed , for any physical states @xmath26 specified by the condition @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 it is an easy exercise to show from this equation that _ all the physical ( that is , brs - singlet ) particles are color - singlet_@xcite .",
    "the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : null ] ) , however , does _ not _ give a well - defined color charge operator generally .",
    "this is because there is a massless one - particle contribution to @xmath20 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 so that the 3-volume integration does not converge . to show this",
    ", we have first to explain the elementary quartet ( a quartet = a pair of brs - doublets ) .",
    "we can easily show that there always exists a massless quartet for each group index @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , using the equation of motion @xmath32 and equal time anti - commutation relation , we find an identity @xmath33 implying that @xmath34 but , an identity @xmath35 means the ward - takahashi identity @xmath36 so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : wt1 ] ) implies also an identity : @xmath37 the identities ( [ eq : wt1 ] ) and ( [ eq : wt2 ] ) give exact green functions and so the presence of massless pole @xmath38 implies that the following four massless asymptotic fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 exist for each group index @xmath31 : @xmath43 from brs transformation law @xmath44=\\dmc$ ] and @xmath45 , we find that these asymptotic fields transform as follows under the brs transformation : @xmath46=\\gamma ^a(x)\\ , \\qquad",
    "\\{\\qb,\\,\\bar \\gamma ^a(x)\\}=\\beta ^a(x ) \\ .\\ ] ] this clearly shows that these asymptotic fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 really forms a brs quartet representation .",
    "now we come back to the well - definedness problem of the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : null ] ) .",
    "the point is that @xmath47 generally contains the one - particle contribution of the massless asymptotic field @xmath48 : @xmath49 where the weight 1 comes from the first term @xmath50 and the weight @xmath51 from the second @xmath52 .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the definition ( [ eq : defu ] ) of @xmath51 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : wt1 ] ) .",
    "we thus see that the operator @xmath30 contains the massless one - particle contribution of the elementary quartet member @xmath42 in the form @xmath53 generally , the other operators @xmath20 and @xmath29 appearing in the maxwell equation ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) also have the one - particle contributions from @xmath42 since they carry the same quantum numbers as @xmath30 : @xmath54 with suitable weights @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in qed , one can easily see that @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the maxwell equation ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) tells us the relation between those weights : @xmath59 the well - defined color charge is , therefore , given by @xmath60 so that the massless one - particle contribution @xmath61 contained in @xmath20 is cancelled by that in @xmath29 .",
    "now , if the condition @xmath4 holds , then we have @xmath62 and so the well - defined color charge eq .",
    "( [ eq : welldefined ] ) happens to coincide with the previous brs - exact expression ( [ eq : null ] ) implying the color confinement .",
    "i have noticed this relation @xmath63 for the first time in studying the renormalization problem in the background field method in collaboration with imamura and van proeyen@xcite .",
    "however , the proof by that method is a bit complicated and so here i will give a simpler proof using a similar method to aokis@xcite which he used when proving the electro - magnetic charge universality in the weinberg - salam model .",
    "add @xmath64 to both sides of the maxwell equation ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) , and then we have @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the color current giving the well - defined color charge ( [ eq : welldefined ] ) . using a relation @xmath67 following from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kankei ] ) , we find @xmath68 sandwitching this with two physical states @xmath69 and @xmath70 satisfying @xmath71 , yields @xmath72    we now make an operation @xmath73 act on both sides of this equation and evaluate the both sides separately . start with the left - hand side . because of the presence of the divergence @xmath74 , only massless one - particle pole contribution to the matrix element @xmath75 can survive in this limit .",
    "but such a massless one - particle pole ( if any ) comes from the gauge boson contribution as shown in fig .",
    "1    .2 cm = 4.5 cm    and generally takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 stands for the propagator from @xmath78 to the renormalized gauge boson @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for the vertex of the renormalized gauge boson between the on - shell initial and final states .",
    "@xmath81 is a weight factor and @xmath82 is the renormalized coupling constant . substituting this expression , we find that the left - hand side becomes @xmath83 noting the pole term @xmath84 vanishes owing to the  current conservation \" at the vertex , we obtain @xmath85 the weight factor @xmath81 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pole ] ) can easily be related to the previous weight @xmath56 : using @xmath86 and the wt identity ( [ eq : wt2 ] ) with @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 comparison of which with the divergence of the second equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pole ] ) leads to @xmath89    the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : aoki ] ) , on the other hand , can be easily evaluated for @xmath90 component as follows : @xmath91 now comparing this with the above eq .  (",
    "[ eq : lhs ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : kankei2 ] ) , we finally obtain a relation @xmath92 but , if we use the relation @xmath93 between the bare and renormalized coupling constants @xmath94 and @xmath82 , this is nothing but the desired relation @xmath95 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "we have proved the relation @xmath95 in covariant gauges with arbitrary values of gauge parameter @xmath13 . in landau gauge @xmath96 , however , it is easier to show it .",
    "first define the following two - point functions @xmath97 here and henceforth we use an abbreviated notation : @xmath98 the suffix 1pi generally denotes the one - particle irreducible vertex . then",
    ", we have @xmath99 but this must equal @xmath100 because of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wt2 ] ) so that @xmath101 on the other hand , a simple diagramatical consideration shows that @xmath102 and hence that @xmath103 the last green function @xmath104 must be equal to @xmath105 because of the definition ( [ eq : defu ] ) of the function @xmath16 so that @xmath106 have to have the form @xmath107 with @xmath108 being an arbitrary function . up to here all the equations hold for any covariant @xmath13 gauges .",
    "but , in landau gauge @xmath96 , we have additionally an identity @xmath109 this is because the derivative factor acting on the anti - ghost at the @xmath110-@xmath111-@xmath112 vertex at the right end of the diagrams can be transferred to act on the external ghost since @xmath113 in the landau gauge .",
    "therefore we have @xmath114 this relation yields at @xmath115 @xmath116 but , since @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the landau gauge , this shows the relation @xmath119 , thus proving the desired identity eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "how is @xmath120 expected to be realized ? naively , we immediately expect the following two possibilities : 1 .",
    "@xmath121 , and @xmath122finite .",
    "2 .  @xmath123finite , and @xmath124 .",
    "however , since the condition is concerned with only the ratio , we have , for instance , even the possibility 3 .",
    "@xmath124 , but / and @xmath125 . here",
    "i mean that @xmath10 has a higher zero than @xmath6 ; , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "let us now explain this .",

    ", it must be a bound - state in the @xmath139 channel .",
    "so it is natural exists but nevertheless does not produce a pole in the 1pi green function @xmath106 .",
    "this might not be so strange a possibility since we are now considering in any case such an unfamiliar situation that the always existing quartet member @xmath42 disappears from the operator @xmath30 .",
    "this point was emphasized by izawa@xcite .",
    "but , if @xmath106 does not show up the massless vector pole , then , where will the asymptotic vector field @xmath136 produce its pole at all ? ] to suppose that it should show up as a pole in the 1pi green function @xmath106 , namely , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acab ] ) @xmath140 the vector massless pole @xmath141 should appear in the @xmath142-part , , in @xmath16 .",
    "but this contradicts with the present assumption @xmath143 .",
    "this argument , therefore , suggests that the massless vector pole in @xmath144 , which existed in the perturbation phase , should disappear ( or the appearance of mass gap ) : namely , @xmath145 corresponding to the above possibility 3 .",
    "the conclusion in the previous section reminds me hata s work@xcite who clarified a symmetry aspect of the ` strange ' condition @xmath4 .",
    "so let us briefly recapitulate what he has done in this context .    in qed , the covariant @xmath13 gauge fixing still leaves a symmetry under the gauge transformation with transformation parameter linear in @xmath146 : @xmath147 although being a ( special )  local \" gauge symmetry , this transformation can be regarded as a combination of global transformations with @xmath146-independent parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we have accordingly conserved noether charges , vector one @xmath150 and scalar one @xmath151 , ( the latter @xmath151 being just a usual electro - magnetic ( global @xmath152 ) charge ) , and they give the generators of the original transformation : @xmath153 = \\partial _",

    "! it also says that the massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode corresponding to the spontaneous breaking should appear in the @xmath154 channel .",
    "it can be argued that , as far as the global @xmath152 symmetry corresponding to the scalar charge @xmath151 is not spontaneously broken , the ng mode must be a vector particle so that the photon can be identified with the nambu - goldstone vector@xcite !",
    "[ this type of argument is important since it _ proves _ the existence and exact masslessness of the photon .",
    "quite a parallel argument can apply to gravity@xcite and proves the existence and exact masslessness of the graviton . ]",
    "hata considered the same thing in non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "corresponding to the ",
    "local \" gauge transformation , @xmath156 there appear the following scalar and vector charges , both of which carry color index @xmath31 now : @xmath157 in this case , however , the vector transformation with parameter @xmath158 is not an exact symmetry but is slightly violated and so @xmath159 in his second paper@xcite , hata considered a modified vector transformation which becomes an exact symmetry .",
    "but here we continue to consider the present simplified version . again , this  local symmetry \" with parameter @xmath160 is spontaneously broken in the perturbation phase and the usual perturb - ative massless gauge boson can be identified with nambu - goldstone vector .",
    "contrary to the qed case , however , there is a possibility that this  local symmetry \" is restored dynamically in the non - abelian case .",
    "hata s picture for the color confinement is as follows : @xmath161 indeed , if the  local symmetry \" is dynamically restored , then the massless vector pole ( , perturbative gauge boson pole ) in the current @xmath162 should disappear and it will have no massless pole contribution .",
    "this requirement actually leads to the above condition @xmath4 of ours , since we have @xmath163 namely our condition @xmath4 is a necessary condition for the restoration of the  local symmetry \" .",
    "i do not know whether it is also sufficient , but our discussion in the previous section strongly suggests that it _ is_. hata also gave another interesting direct proof that any colored particle has to be a brs - doublet if the current @xmath164 has no massless pole , by considering a 3-point green function of @xmath164 and the two fields corresponding to that colored particle@xcite .",
    "one may wonder how it is possible at all to satisfy our confinement condition @xmath4 .",
    "this question is quite natural if we note the fact that @xmath165 is both infrared and ultraviolet divergent in perturbation theory !    however , we should recall that quite a similar thing is actually realized in the non - linear sigma models in two dimension . as an example , consider the following @xmath166 sigma model again following hata@xcite : @xmath167 the non - linearly realized @xmath166 symmetry is the transformation : @xmath168 with @xmath169 . in perturbation phase , this non - linear symmetry is ( spontaneously ) broken and the fields @xmath170 are the corresponding massless ng bosons .",
    "the restoration condition for this symmetry is given by , in the leading order in @xmath171 expansion , @xmath172 this is quite analogous to our condition @xmath4 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath173 corresponds to our @xmath51 , and is indeed both infrared and ultraviolet divergent in perturbation calculation !",
    "nevertheless we know@xcite that @xmath174 is actually realized in this model .",
    "it is known rather generally that a mass gap appears and the nonlinear symmetry is dynamically restored in a wide variety of two dimensional non - linear sigma models .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "this resemblance of dynamical symmetry restorations between yang - mills gauge theory in four dimension and non - linear sigma model in two dimension , is not a mere analogy .",
    "indeed , it becomes an exact correspondence if we consider a pure gauge model of yang - mills theory in four dimension@xcite .",
    "let us close this talk by briefly explaining this .",
    "take the @xmath175 yang - mills theory with @xmath176 symmetric gauge fixing : @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 denote brs and anti - brs transformations , respectively .",
    "the pure gauge model is given by replacing the gauge field @xmath144 in this lagrangian by the pure gauge mode @xmath180 : @xmath181 then , the @xmath182 term drops out and only the gauge - fixing term remains .",
    "namely the pure gauge model is a kind of topological model .",
    "one can show very easily that this model is _ exactly _ equivalent by the parisi - sourlas mechanism to the two dimensional @xmath183 non - linear sigma model with the action @xmath184 this model has an @xmath185 symmetry under the transformation @xmath186 . very interestingly ,",
    "the current corresponding to the @xmath187 symmetry is found to be given by @xmath188 so , if the symmetry is restored , then it implies that our condition @xmath4 is literally realized .",
    "this is what actually occurs as we know from the exact result due to polyakov and wiegmann@xcite .",
    "so this pure gauge model has a possibility to be used as a ",
    "zeroth order \" theory in a new form of  perturbation theory \" in the actual non - abelian gauge theory , in which the confinement condition @xmath4 is satisfied order by order .",
