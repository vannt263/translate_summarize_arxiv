    "( [ eq - hamiltonian ] ) ] . however , the specific heat curves at large magnetic fields ( 2.82 and 3.57 t ) were poorly fitted by the ed calculations . actually , since at such strong field ( 2.8 t @xmath109 4.4 t ) the ground state of the system is in a quantum critical region ( luttinger liquid phase @xcite ) and is supposed to have rather long correlation lengths at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , ed calculations with such a small system size ( up to @xmath107 ) might be insufficient for an accurate estimation in that circumstance , and a large - scale thermodynamic algorithm is essentially needed to clarify this ambiguity .",
