    "the search for particle processes of astrophysical significance to which gravitation makes a non - negligible contribution is in general difficult , though potentially rewarding .",
    "the entire field of gravitational lensing is in fact based on the discovery of one such process in which light interacts with gravity @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that a number of additional processes will point out new directions of investigation .",
    "the search is made more difficult , unfortunately , by the fact that the lowest order feynman diagrams that represent the dominant contribution to a process , are frequently forbidden by kinematics .",
    "consider , for instance , the process in which an incoming massive particle of momentum @xmath0 and dispersion relation @xmath1 produces a photon of momentum @xmath2 , while the outgoing particle has momentum @xmath3 .",
    "conservation of energy - momentum requires @xmath4 . in the rest frame of @xmath5",
    "we have @xmath6 , which gives @xmath7 , @xmath8 and again @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 leads to @xmath11 which shows that for @xmath12 , the case considered , we get @xmath13 and the process becomes physically meaningless .",
    "there are processes , however , in which massive particles emitting a photon are not kinematically forbidden .",
    "this is certainly the case when gravitation alters the dispersion relations of at least one of the particles involved @xcite .",
    "we stress here that even the reduction of a feynman diagram by a single vertex would result in a cross - section gain of a factor @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are mass and radius of the gravitational source ( units @xmath17 ) .",
    "external gravitational fields have long been known to play the role of a medium @xcite in the propagation of particles , be these treated classically , or according to quantum mechanics . in the latter case scattering by a newtonian potential has been the subject of several investigations @xcite , but bremsstrahlung @xcite , the emission of crenkov radiation @xcite and other processes @xcite have also been studied in connection with various gravitational sources . as stated above , external gravitational fields do alter the dispersion relations of a particle propagating in a gravitational background at least to the extent that the particle is no longer on shell .",
    "it would therefore appear sufficient to somehow solve a wave equation to obtain the desired result .",
    "this is done in quantum electrodynamics where the electromagnetic field is however represented by a four - vector of which only a single component is usually taken into account @xcite . the case of gravity , represented by a second rank tensor , is considerably more complicated . moreover , the theoretical prediction by mashhoon @xcite , confirmed by other authors @xcite , of the existence of a coupling of gravity to spin , requires that the effect of a gravitational field be no longer limited to a single component of the metric .",
    "this has become even more pressing since the experimental observation of spin - rotation coupling for photons @xcite and neutrons @xcite and of other important spin - induced effects at the macroscopic level @xcite .",
    "external gravitational fields contribute to the solution of covariant wave equations through a berry phase @xcite .",
    "this should be expected because in metric theories of gravitation @xcite , general relativity in particular , the space parameter of berry s theory coincides with space - time .",
    "it has been shown that the wave equations for fermions and bosons can be solved exactly to first order in the metric deviation @xmath18 for any metric @xmath19 and that the phases so calculated @xcite give reliable results in interferometry , gyroscopy @xcite and optics @xcite , give the correct einstein deflection , can be used in the study of neutrino helicity and flavour oscillations @xcite and of spin - gravity coupling in general @xcite .",
    "they also reproduce a variety of known effects as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relations of a particle propagating in a gravitational background can be derived from the respective covariant wave equations .",
    "the gravitational phases mentioned above , change , in effect , a particle four - momentum by acting on the wave function of the field - free equations .",
    "this result applies equally well to fermions and bosons and can be extended to all orders in @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of even the most elementary feynman diagrams does require an appropriate treatment when gravitational fields are present .",
    "the procedures developed in @xcite fill in part this gap and apply to linearized gravitational , or inertial fields of any type up to intermediate intensities .",
    "the present paper focuses on the applications of the procedures outlined in @xcite rather than on the individual reactions , though the aim still is to find physical processes capable of leading to potentially observable results .",
    "below , we give examples of processes that can be treated in ways that are similar .",
    "because of the intrinsic resemblance , gravitational bremsstrahlung @xcite will be added to this category in due time .    additional interesting possibilities",
    "do moreover arise when particles propagate in a gravitational background . in the conclusions , for instance",
    ", we briefly discuss properties of the `` space - time medium '' such as dispersion .",

    "the transition amplitude @xmath64 , estimated in @xcite , is given by @xcite @xmath65 however @xmath66 contains the part @xmath0 of ( [ mom ] ) , that comes from @xmath67 , but not the new part that contains the gravitational contribution due to the propagation of the fermion in the field of the source .",
    "to @xmath68 this process is indistinguishable from bremsstrahlung and is dealt with , more properly , in that context .",
    "it will not be discussed further in this work .",
    "the calculation now requires that a metric be selected .",
    "let us consider the particular instance of a fermion that is propagating with momentum @xmath69 , impact parameter @xmath70 and @xmath71 , from @xmath72 toward a gravitational source of mass @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 placed at the origin and described by the metric @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",

    "all spin matrices are now expressed in terms of ordinary , constant dirac matrices .",
    "we also assume that the on - shell conditions @xmath77 remain valid .",
    "extension of the calculation to include different particles , or higher order gravitational contributions to @xmath78 and ( [ psi ] ) can be derived to all orders in @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the fourier transforms of the quantities that appear in ( [ g ] ) must now be calculated .",
    "we obtain @xmath79 @xmath80 four - momentum conservation to zeroth order only is required because ( [ h ] ) , ( [ phgmu ] ) are already of @xmath26 . though the gravitational field selected above is stationary , energy conservation must be introduced because the energy contribution of the field is contained in the generalized momentum of @xmath25 .",
    "we further approximate the bessel function @xmath81 $ ] , itself a distribution , by @xmath82 and eliminate @xmath83 from ( [ h ] ) and ( [ phgmu ] ) .",

    "then appears in @xmath96 exclusively .",

    "by further eliminating from @xmath99 the terms that refer to the kinematically forbidden transition , we again find ( [ m1sq ] ) .",

    "it then follows that the hardest photons are emitted in the backward direction with energy @xmath116 and power @xmath117 which would obviously take its highest values in the neighborhood of a very compact source .    for @xmath118 the inequality ( [ cos ] )",
    "is satisfied for @xmath119 and we also find @xmath120 which diverges for small values of @xmath5 .",
    "this infrared divergence is well - known and arises as a consequence of the finite energy resolution @xmath121 of the outgoing fermion .",
    "the process , as calculated , is in fact indistinguishable from that in which massless particles with energy @xmath122 are also emitted and from processes in which vertex corrections are present ( virtual massless particles emitted and reabsorbed by the external lines of fig.1 ) .",
    "when these additional diagrams are calculated all infrared divergences disappear @xcite . in the particular case at hand , @xmath5 in ( [ w4 ] ) can be simply replaced by @xmath123 . below this value",
    "the process is not kinematically allowed .",
    "the process discussed in this section may be considered as the decay of a fermion of effective mass @xmath124 into a photon and a fermion of mass @xmath125 with a lifetime @xmath126 which is indeed small .",
    "quantitatively , for electrons with @xmath127 , @xmath128 , in the neighborhood of a canonical neutron star , we find @xmath129 .",
    "using the replacements @xmath131 and @xmath132 in fig.1 , we can calculate the process by which a photon produces a fermion @xmath133 of momentum @xmath22 and an anti - fermion @xmath134 of momentum @xmath135 after propagating in a gravitational field .",
    "in addition @xmath136 because of the presence of the antiparticle .",

    "this and @xmath143 again show that if the effect of the gravitational field vanished ( @xmath144 ) , we would re - obtain the meaningless result @xmath145 .",
    "it is therefore the presence of the gravitational field that enables the process .",
    "the effect of the gravitational field on the polarization of the photon is given by @xmath146 where the matrices @xmath147 and @xmath148 are given in @xcite and act on the matrix @xmath149 .",

    "we assume that the fermion that propagates in the gravitational background has generalized momentum @xmath25 . by conservation of energy - momentum",

    "external gravitational fields in radiative processes can be included in the calculation of a transition probability by simply replacing the momentum @xmath0 of a particle with its generalized version @xmath52 in the corresponding expression for the zero - field process .",
    "the examples given involve spin-@xmath194 and spin-@xmath195 particles , but the procedure can be extended to any spin .",
    "an essential point here is that the dispersion relations are altered by the external gravitational field and can be calculated if the corresponding wave equations can be solved to @xmath26 , or higher @xcite .",
    "it follows , in particular , that kinematically forbidden processes similar to that of fig.[fig : feynman2 ] become physical and their transition probabilities can be determined .",
    "the calculation of the gravitational contributions are greatly simplified and can be extended to higher order in @xmath20 .",
    "the applications are not confined to fields of a newtonian type , but extend to any gravitational field . in this respect ,",
    "the procedure presented goes beyond the results that apply to external electromagnetic potentials @xcite , not only because the metric has in general ten components rather than just four , but also because time - independence is not a requirement .",
    "the transition amplitudes derived are @xmath61 to leading order and can therefore be considerably larger than those normally studied in the literature .",
    "the examples given are limited to a single type of physically relevant metric and we can not conclude that the resulting spectra are general and can be used to identify the processes . the actual determination of the spectra requires the use of metrics specific to the problems studied .",
    "however , the results suggest that particle processes like bremsstrahlung , erenkov radiation , or positron production in the neighborhood of compact astrophysical objects , or in cosmology , need to be reconsidered .",
    "space - time has so far been treated as a linear optical medium , though it is by no means clear what its ultimate properties will be as a result of quantum gravity .",
    "it is not in particular known whether its index of refraction will remain unaltered in response to high intensity fluxes of particles .",
    "there is scope for research on this and other properties of space - time .",
    "our final considerations regard the back - reaction that physical processes may have on the gravitational background .",
    "we show below that the back reaction is not always negligible and provide an example of how a very small disturbance in the wave equation can grow rapidly and alter the background gravitational field .",
    "equation ( [ psi ] ) requires that @xmath196 be a solution of the field - free dirac equation and , of course , of the equation @xmath197 .",
    "the approximation procedure still holds true , however , when @xmath196 satisfies more general equations @xcite . with the addition of a dissipation term ,",
    "the equation for @xmath67 becomes @xmath198 where we take @xmath199 @xcite and @xmath200 is a dimensionless , arbitrary parameter , @xmath201 , that reflects the coupling strength of the dissipation term .",
    "when we substitute @xmath202 into ( [ damp ] ) , we obtain @xmath203\\phi_{0}(x)=0\\,.\\ ] ] an example of a problem with similar behaviour is offered by a fluid heated from below . for small temperature gradients",
    "the fluid conducts the heat , but as the gradient increases conduction is not sufficient to lead the heat away and the fluid starts to convect . in realistic problems",
    "the exponential growth of @xmath67 does not continue indefinitely , but is restricted at times @xmath204 by nonlinearities or dispersive effects that may have been initially neglected .",
    "the effect of the new solution @xmath67 on @xmath85 can be found as follows .",
    "we first neglect the change @xmath205 in @xmath85 because in general @xmath206 . setting @xmath207 for simplicity",

    "<S> single - vertex feynman diagrams represent the dominant contribution to physical processes , but are frequently forbidden kinematically . </S>",
    "<S> this is changed when the particles involved propagate in a gravitational background and acquire an effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> procedures are introduced that allow the calculation of lowest order diagrams , their corresponding transition probabilities , emission powers and spectra to all orders in the metric deviation , for particles of any spin propagating in gravitational fields described by any metric . </S>",
    "<S> physical properties of the `` space - time medium '' are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in particular that a small dissipation term in the particle wave equations can trigger a strong back - reaction that introduces resonances in the radiative process and affects the resulting gravitational background . </S>"
