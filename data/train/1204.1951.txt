    "the higgs boson search is underway at the cern lhc . by the recent results , the allowed regions of the higgs boson mass has been constrained to be 117.5 - 118.5 gev , 122.5 - 129 gev and larger than 539 gev at 95% confidence level ( cl ) at the atlas  @xcite , and 114.4 - 127.5 gev and larger than 600 gev at 95% cl at the cms  @xcite .",
    "since the electroweak precision data at the lep suggest that the higgs boson mass is less than around 160 gev at 95% cl  @xcite assuming the standard model ( sm ) , we expect that a light ( sm - like ) higgs boson will be discovered with the mass of around 125 gev soon .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that several phenomena such as tiny neutrino masses  @xcite , existence of dark matter  @xcite and baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite can not be explained in the sm . because there is no strong motivation to the sm ( minimal ) higgs sector",
    ", we may consider extensions of the higgs sector in order to explain these phenomena .",
    "first , by imposing an unbroken discrete symmetry to the higgs sector , we can obtain dark matter candidates , such as the inert doublet model  @xcite .",
    "second , the type - ii seesaw model  @xcite , where a higgs triplet field is added to the sm , can generate neutrino masses at the tree level .",
    "radiative seesaw models  @xcite can also explain neutrino masses at loop levels , where additional scalar bosons , e.g. , charged scalar bosons , are running in the loop .",
    "finally , the scenario based on the electroweak baryogenesis can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe by an additional cp - phase and nondecoupling effects in extended higgs sectors  @xcite .",
    "discoveries of additional scalar bosons such as charged higgs bosons will be direct evidence of extended higgs sectors .",
    "in addition , as indirect signatures , detecting the deviation of the higgs boson couplings with gauge bosons @xmath9 , those with quarks and leptons @xmath10 and higgs selfcoupling constant @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the sm - like higgs boson , from those predicted values in the sm can also be evidence of extended higgs sectors . in particular , once @xmath8 is discovered at the lhc in near future , precision measurements of these coupling constants at the lhc and at the international linear collider ( ilc ) turns to be very important .",
    "therefore , in order to distinguish various extended higgs sectors , it is necessary to prepare precise calculations for the higgs boson interactions including radiative corrections .    in this letter",
    ", we construct the renormalization scheme for the one - loop calculation of the observables in the higgs sector such as mass spectrum and coupling constants in the higgs triplet model ( htm ) , where the hypercharge @xmath0 higgs triplet field is added to the sm .",
    "the htm is motivated to generate tiny neutrino masses by the type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "this model is unique because the electroweak rho parameter deviates from unity at the tree level .",
    "in such a model , unlike the sm , four independently measured parameters such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are necessary to describe the electroweak observables  @xcite . in the model with the @xmath15 higgs triplet field ,",
    "the rho parameter and the w boson mass were calculated at the one - loop level in the on - shell scheme in ref .",
    "recently , in the htm , one - loop corrections to the rho parameter as well as the w boson mass have been studied  @xcite , and it is clarified that relatively large mass differences among the triplet - like higgs bosons are favored by the precision data at the lep / slc  @xcite . however , radiative corrections to the higgs sector with renormalization have not been studied in the htm so far .    in the htm",
    ", there are seven physics scalar states ; i.e. , the doubly - charged @xmath5 , the singly - charged @xmath6 , a cp - odd @xmath4 as well as two cp - even ( @xmath8 and @xmath3 ) scalar states .",
    "when the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet field @xmath16 is much smaller than that of the doublet field @xmath17 as required by the electroweak precision data , @xmath8 behaves as the sm - like higgs boson while @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the triplet - like ones .",
    "phenomenology for the htm has been studied in refs .",
    "when the triplet - like higgs bosons are degenerated in mass , @xmath18 mainly decays into the same sign dilepton or the diboson depending on the magnitude of @xmath16 . on the other hand , in the case with the mass difference among the triplet - like fields , cascade decays of the triplet - like higgs bosons can be dominant  @xcite .",
    "for example , when @xmath18 ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) is the heaviest of all the triplet - like higgs bosons , the main decay mode of @xmath18 ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) can be @xmath19 or @xmath20 ( @xmath3 or @xmath21 ) . in any case , measuring the masses of the triplet - like higgs bosons is important to test the htm .    for @xmath22 ,",
    "characteristic relationships among the masses of the triplet - like higgs bosons are predicted at the tree level  @xcite : @xmath23 up to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the masses of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these formulae are useful to distinguish the model from the others which also contain charged scalar bosons when the masses of the triplet - like higgs bosons are measured with sufficient accuracy . in particular , in order to compare the mass spectrum with future precision measurements , it is very important to evaluate the radiative correction to the above tree - level formulae .",
    "we first define @xmath29 in order to investigate how the mass formulae in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intro1 ] ) are modified by the quantum effect .",
    "we find that the magnitude for @xmath30 can be as large as @xmath31 when we take parameter sets favored by the electroweak precision data : @xmath22 , @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 gev  @xcite .    the theoretical prediction on the triple higgs boson coupling @xmath7 is also quite important because the higgs potential is reconstructed by measuring the mass of @xmath8 and the coupling of @xmath7 . in the case of the two higgs doublet model , radiative corrections to the coupling of @xmath7",
