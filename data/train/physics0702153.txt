    "this paper merges two parallel attempts to reform the teaching of energy in the introductory physics curriculum , one more mathematical , and the other more conceptual and visual .",
    "many authors have pointed out that single particle mathematical models become misleading when applied to situations involving changes in internal energy.@xcite such situations are a valuable lever to induce reform of the physics curriculum , because they dramatically make a crucial point : that a student s ability to obtain a correct mathematical answer to a problem has little correlation with conceptual understanding . in a recent tpt article,@xcite carl mungan reviewed proposals for dealing with internal energy . in a much earlier review ,",
    "malinckrodt and leff@xcite identified a total of seven different types of work referenced in the literature , which are related to six state - dependent energy functions , producing a multiplicity of work - energy relationships which they selectively apply to solve problems .",
    "as mallinckrodt and leff say , `` the abundance of papers devoted to energy transformations , and in particular , work in macroscopic systems is indicative of the discomfort many physics teachers experience in the area . ''",
    "these attempts to reform the energy curriculum have in common a desire to formulate the concepts , terminology , and mathematics of internal energy to dovetail as seamlessly as possible with the typical treatment of the subject in textbooks and introductory courses .",
    "this creates an important bridge between elementary mechanics on the one hand , and thermodynamics and solid - state physics on the other .",
    "since the energy curriculum in introductory physics typically starts with the single - particle work - energy theorem , these authors spend considerable effort to delineate the scope of this theorem so that teachers and students can identify the class of problems to which it applies , and the class of problems for which it fails .",
    "since the typical curriculum defines work using a dot product of force and displacement of the center of mass , these authors recommend terms such as `` pseudo - work , '' `` center - of - mass - work , '' and `` particle - work '' to refer to this product when it does not equal an amount of energy transferred through the boundary of a system - which is the only thermodynamically valid definition of work .",
    "they apply both a multi - particle first law of thermodynamics and a single - particle work - energy theorem to the same physical system , and solve the equations simultaneously.@xcite    others argue that it s better to teach introductory students to qualitatively track the storage and flow of energy , leaving nuanced variations in terminology and complex mathematics to more advanced courses.@xcite indeed , another emerging reform of the introductory energy curriculum uses qualitative and semi - quantitative diagrams and graphs as developed by vanheuvelen and zou@xcite , falk and hermann@xcite , and adapted by the modeling workshop project@xcite . in this approach , diagrams and graphs provide a concrete and visual means to track energy storage and transfer , supplementing verbal descriptions and equations . using this approach ,",
    "the course sequence is substantially changed .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics is introduced from the very beginning by defining energy as `` the ability to cause change . ''",
    "this definition is more general than `` the ability to do work , '' because it does not restrict energy to mechanics , but includes energy transfer by conducting and radiating as well as working .",
    "students first exercises in the subject require them to demonstrate their understanding of energy conservation by using diagrams and graphs to show where and how energy is stored at every instant of time .",
    "these qualitative and semi - quantitative exercises include energy storage in biological , chemical , and thermal , as well as mechanical systems.@xcite the diagrams and graphs also require students to explicitly identify the objects inside their system and to show the transfer of energy into or out of that system , in correspondence with the thermodynamic definition of work .",
    "since the curriculum includes internal energy stored in multi - particle systems from the beginning , invocation of the single - particle work energy theorem is unnecessary and is therefore frequently deleted .",
    "instead , students solve quantitative problems by matching formulas for energy storage or transfer with different parts of the diagrams .",
    "the structural relationship among these parts serves as a guide to develop a conservation of energy equation ( the first law of thermodynamics ) specific to the situation .",
    "the mathematical formalism of mungan , sherwood , arons et .",
    "al . dovetails nicely with the typical textbook presentation of energy , but fits awkwardly with the qualitative - visual approach of swartz , vanheuvelen , falk , swackhamer and others . in the qualitative - graphical approach , the work - energy equation has not been introduced in the first place , so there is little need to spend time explaining its limits , nor is it convenient to use it for mathematical solutions in combination with the first law of thermodynamics . since work is defined as thermodynamic work and given explicit visual representation , such terms as `` pseudo - work , '' `` center - of - mass - work , '' and `` internal - work '' become misleading .",
    "i find great value in both the qualitative - visual approach and the rigor of the mathematical formalism .",
    "in this paper , i show how these two approaches can exist together more harmoniously .",
    "since the curriculum is aimed at introductory students , this paper takes the smallest possible step in mathematical complexity - from one - particle to two - particle models - necessary to achieve consistency with a sound conceptual approach to energy .",
    "the mathematical development is guided by the idea that the term `` work '' should receive a clear conceptual definition as energy that is transferred through the boundary of a system ; mathematical expressions are identified as work - of any sort - only when they correspond to this definition . even greater simplification",
    "is achieved by extracting some physically sensible guidelines from the mathematical theory , enabling introductory students to bypass difficult mathematics while making sense of the most troublesome examples .",
    "the result is an approach to these issues that is conceptually correct , mathematically rigorous , and yet simple enough for the introductory student to understand .",
    "it is mathematically equivalent to previous formulations , but obtains the advantage that the mathematics flows directly from the conceptual analysis in a straightforward manner .",
    "in this section , i review a collection of problems for which changes in internal energy play a prominent role .",
    "these problems have been discussed extensively by previous authors @xcite who show that the conflict between a single particle mathematical model and the energy concepts creates a barrier to student understanding of energy .",
    "my main purpose is to show how students can use pie charts , bar graphs and energy flow diagrams to illustrate the storage and transfer of energy .",
    "two frictionless pucks of mass m , connected by a string , are accelerated by the force f. ]    bruce sherwood attributes the following problem to michael wiessman.@xcite it is also extensively discussed by arnold arons.@xcite i adopt aron s description . ``",
    "consider the situation [ in figure [ fig:2pucks - string ] , ] in which two frictionless pucks of mass @xmath0 , connected by a string , are accelerated by the force @xmath1 .",
    "( note that this is a deformable system , that the force is displaced farther than the center of mass point , and that the pucks are assumed to undergo an inelastic collision on contact . ) ''",
    "pie charts illustrating that energy starts as chemical energy in the person s muscles and is gradually transferred to the pucks and stored as kinetic energy and thermal energy . ]    by the time they arrive in an introductory physics course , most students can glibly recite a version of energy conservation such as , `` energy can neither be created nor destroyed .",
    "'' energy pie charts ( figure [ fig:2pucks - pie - charts ] ) require students to express their understanding of energy conservation in a stronger form .",
    "the pie charts track an amount of energy over time as it is transferred from one location to another , requiring students to identify where and how the energy is stored at every instant of time .",
    "if there is any instant when they can not do so , this points out a deficiency in their energy model in violation of conservation of energy . at first",
    ", students have difficulty drawing a correct set of energy pie charts to describe even a simple situation because they typically harbor persistent misconceptions about the meaning of energy and its conservation , even when they can recite a version of energy conservation and correctly solve the problem mathematically.@xcite in my classroom , i often probe students understanding by asking them to draw pie charts before , after , or between the ones they have already drawn , inevitably revealing beliefs that kinetic energy is `` being used '' and is not stored anywhere , that transfer of energy is not a gradual process but happens all at once `` from potential to kinetic , '' and a belief in the equivalence of rest and potential energy storage , so that falling objects instantly recover their gravitational energy upon impact with the ground . if you do nt believe your students harbor misconceptions , try asking them to draw a set of pie charts .",
    "figure 2 shows that the energy that eventually ends up in the pucks starts out stored in the person s muscles as chemical potential energy and is gradually transferred to the pucks , where it is stored partially as kinetic energy and partially as thermal energy because of the inelastic collision.@xcite    energy bar graphs and energy flow diagram showing similar information to the pie charts , but emphasizing the choice of system and its role in defining work . ]",
    "energy bar graphs and energy flow diagrams ( figure [ fig : bar - flow-2puck ] ) together show much the same information as the energy pie charts , but with a different emphasis . in both representations ,",
    "the dotted lines demarcate the boundaries of the system . only objects and energy inside the boundary",
    "are actually in the system . in the energy flow diagram",
    ", a line indicates an interaction between the objects .",
    "adding an arrow to the line indicates flow of energy .",
    "clearly defining a system is a crucial step in solving any physics problem , and energy is no exception .",
    "these diagrams make the separation between system and environment explicit .",
    "the bar graphs focus student attention on the initial and final energy state of the system , and require students to consciously consider conservation of energy by making their energy bars stack up to the same height .",
    "by contrast , each pie chart automatically represents the same amount of energy , forcing student ideas to be consistent with energy conservation even if they havent given the matter explicit thought .",
    "the energy flow diagram focuses students on the objects where the energy is stored and the direction of energy transfer .",
    "the pie charts , by contrast , focus more on the mechanism of energy storage - chemical , kinetic , etc . - and imply energy transfer as a continuous evolution of energy storage rather than show it directly with an arrow . in this specific case",
    ", the left - hand bar graph shows where and how the energy is stored before the person starts pulling , and the right - hand bar graph shows the energy storage after the pucks collide .",
    "the energy flow diagram shows the transfer of energy from the person , through the system boundary to the pucks and string .",
    "since this energy passes through the system boundary , it can be identified as work .",
    "teaching with multiple representations allows the teacher access to parts of students mental models which would otherwise remain hidden .",
    "teachers can probe student understanding and get them to think more deeply by asking questions that make them translate information from one representation to another .",
    "for example , the teacher can ask how diagrams and graphs should be modified in case certain changes are made to the problem statement , or how diagrams , graphs and the physical conditions of a problem would have to change if the equations are modified .",
    "students also improve their ability to talk to each other about abstract topics , because debate obtains a concrete focus in the manipulation of parts of the diagram .",
    "this allows a much larger percentage of the class to follow and therefore participate than if discussion remained solely in the verbal and mathematical mode .",
    "the use of diagrams , graphs and student - to - student discourse makes it much more likely that students will think by applying a model and continually refining it , as opposed to merely memorizing algorithms or specific answers.@xcite    energy pie charts , bar graphs and flow diagram for a car skidding to a stop .",
    "the inset shows a simpler energy flow diagram in which the car is treated as a single object .",
    "both versions are correct .",
    "which option you choose depends on the level of detail appropriate for your students and on the concepts you wish to emphasize . ]",
    "the following problem and variations are discussed by many authors.@xcite a car of mass @xmath0 traveling with velocity @xmath2 on a level road travels a distance @xmath3 while skidding to a stop .",
    "figure [ fig : diagram - car - kinetic ] illustrates that the kinetic energy of the car is transferred to thermal energy stored in both the car and the road .",
    "only the portion of the kinetic energy that is actually transferred to the road passes through the system boundary and can be considered as work .",
    "the rest of the thermal energy initially remains in the car , as represented by the portion of the bar graph within the dotted system boundary in the right - hand diagram .",
    "part of this will gradually pass through through the system boundary as it dissipates , but we have restricted our consideration to an interval of time before this occurs.@xcite    a skater stands at rest on frictionless ice and pushes off of a rigid wall . ]",
    "the following problem involves a so - called `` zero work force , '' which causes acceleration without doing any work.@xcite a skater stands at rest on frictionless ice and pushes off of a rigid wall , as shown in figure [ fig : skater - wall ] .",
    "the skater exerts a constant horizontal force @xmath1 and her center of mass is a distance @xmath3 farther from the wall after the push .",
    "a rigid wall undergoes no changes as a result of the push , and so does not change its energy state .",
    "figure [ fig : wall - skate - diagrams ] shows that the energy initially stored in the person s muscles ends up stored as kinetic energy without ever leaving the person . if we choose the entire person as our system , wishing to concentrate on physics and avoid the complications of analyzing individual muscle cells in the person s arm , then the energy transfer in the problem never passes through the system boundary .",
    "zero work is done in this problem , according to the only thermodynamically valid definition of work as energy transferred into our system from external objects.@xcite forces which cause acceleration without transferring energy are actually quite common .",
    "for example , when a person walks , runs , or jumps into the air , when a car crashes into a brick wall or when a rigid object rolls without slipping , the wall or floor in each case undergoes no change and so does not change its energy state . even though there is a force between the wall or floor and the system ,",
    "there is no energy transfer between these objects and therefore no work .",

    "once again , the inset shows a simpler energy flow diagram in which the person is treated as a single object .",
    "both versions are correct .",
    "which option you choose depends on the level of detail appropriate for your students and on the concepts you wish to emphasize . ]",
    "if students first gain sufficient practice using the diagrams and graphs to express and refine their ideas , starting with easier problems and progressing in difficulty , they will continue to use them - and by implication the conceptual analysis they represent - as the starting point for quantitative analysis . to help students move from a conceptual - visual analysis to equations ,",
    "the curriculum must now provide expressions for amounts of energy stored and transferred , as well as a way to associate those expressions with different parts of the diagrams and graphs , and by implication with the concepts those parts represent .",
    "the overall structure of the diagrams and graphs then allows the student to write an appropriate conservation of energy equation . in section iii",
    ", i will use a two - particle model to derive appropriate expressions for internal energy and associate them with the visual representations . in section iv ,",
    "i simplify those results to four physically sensible guidelines and show how they can be used to solve the problems we have just examined conceptually .",
    "this theory is mathematically equivalent to previous theories of internal energy in introductory physics , but my approach is designed to fit much better with the conceptual and visual introduction .",
    "to apply energy to complex systems , it can be assumed that a macroscopic object is composed of structureless point particles interacting with each other by means of conservative , central forces .",
    "i will closely follow the development of multi - body theory in david hestenes new foundations for mechanics,@xcite but will apply it only to a two - particle system .",
    "the mathematical development is guided by the idea that the term `` work '' should receive a clear conceptual definition as energy that is transferred through the boundary of a system ; a mathematical expression will be identified as work - of any sort - only when it corresponds to this definition .",
    "the two - particle results can be generalized to a system with an arbitrarily large , but finite number of particles and the conclusions are similar .",
    "our system will be composed of two particles with masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 , positions @xmath6and @xmath7 and exerting mutual forces @xmath8 and @xmath9 , assumed to obey the third law , to be conservative , directed along the line joining the two particles , and to depend only on their relative position , @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "external objects exert a total force @xmath12 on particle 1 and total force @xmath13 on particle 2 .",
    "in other words :    @xmath14    since these assumptions are properties of almost all fundamental interactions between elementary particles , the multi - body theory we develop will have broad applicability .",
    "hestenes begins his analysis with the following observation :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ to analyze the behavior of a system , we must separate it from its environment .",
    "this is done by distinguishing external and internal variables .",
    "the external variables describe the system as a whole and its interaction with other ( external ) systems .",
    "the internal variables describe the ( internal ) structure of the system and the interactions among its parts .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for the system of both particles ,",
    "the external variables include : @xmath15    the internal variables describe the motion of the particles relative to the center of mass as well as their interactions with each other .",
    "these include @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 as well as : @xmath18 notice that i use capital letters with subscripts to refer to individual particle variables , plain capital letters to refer to external variables , and lower - case letters to refer to internal variables .",
    "the total internal energy of a multi - particle system is the sum of the kinetic energy due to motion of the particles relative to the center of mass and the potential energy stored in the fields between the particles , which depends on the inter - particle distances . while it is straightforward to account for the internal energy of a two - particle system by simply adding these terms , the method quickly becomes unwieldy as the number of particles in the system increases . for large systems , it is usually easier to reorganize equation [ eq : eint ] into a smaller number of terms that are more accessible to macroscopic measurements .",
    "hence , the internal energy includes the thermal energy due to oscillations of the particles in the system .",
    "when the system changes shape because it is compressed , stretched or bent in any way , then inter - particle distances must change , altering the internal potential energy .",
    "if such deformations are elastic , then internal kinetic energy may later change as some part of the system recovers by `` springing back . ''",
    "if the system is capable of undergoing a change in phase or a chemical change , the resulting changes in inter - particle distances and configurations will change the internal energy as well.@xcite although it may not be immediately obvious , the internal energy also includes rotational kinetic energy .",
    "consider the case of a rigid body , for which the distances of each particle relative to the center of mass as well as relative to each other are fixed . in that case , the only way particles can move relative to the center of mass is if the entire object rotates with angular velocity @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the distance of the ith particle from the axis of rotation and i is the moment of inertia about that axis .",
    "introductory texts usually include a lengthier derivation of rotational kinetic energy and moment of inertia , and it could be said that i am now applying a similar treatment to all internal energy .",
    "the total kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energy of the two particles , but it can be separated into internal and external parts using equations [ eq : int - v ] , [ eq : ext - v ] and [ eq : ext - mass].@xcite    @xmath22    to relate changes in kinetic energy to the forces on the system , we take the derivative of [ eq : ke - total ] and use [ eq : n2single ] .",
    "@xmath23    the right - hand side of equation [ eq : dketot / dt ] can be expressed in terms of internal and external variables using equations [ eq : int - v ] and [ eq : ext - f ] .@xcite @xmath24 where the relative velocity is * @xmath25*. combining equation [ eq : dketot / dt ] with equations [ eq : ext - power ] and [ eq : int - power ] then anti - differentiating and using [ eq : deltauint ] and [ eq : eint ] , we find : @xmath26    this is the full energy equation for our two - particle system .",
    "it presents us with a sum of three integrals involving dot - products of force and displacement . in keeping with the previously mentioned guideline",
    ", i defer defining any of these integrals as work until it can be determined whether they represent energy transferred through the boundary of the two - particle system .",
    "the last two integrals become easier to interpret if the purely external terms are subtracted from the equation .",
    "start by differentiating equation [ eq : ext - ke ] and using [ eq : n2single ] , [ eq : ext - f ] and [ eq : ext - a ] to obtain @xmath27 , which can be anti - differentiated to obtain : @xmath28 subtracting equation [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] from equation [ eq : dkeext+deint ] , we find the remaining terms are related by : @xmath29 to paraphrase hestenes@xcite , this equation describes alteration of the internal energy by external forces .",
    "specifically this occurs when external objects force particles of the system to move relative to the center of mass .",
    "this implies rotation and/or deformation of the system , both visible consequences of external forces that can alert students to internal energy transfers as they gradually build a complete concept of energy .",
    "it is precisely when the system is rotated or deformed that it can not be approximated as a single particle and a two - particle model becomes the simplest approach that retains an accurate understanding of energy .",
    "this not only provides a meaning for the last two integrals in equation [ eq : dkeext+deint ] , it tells us that the integral in equation [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] can be interpreted as the work only when the the external forces cause no changes in internal energy so that the two integrals in equation [ eq : delta - e - int ] sum to zero . in that case , the only source for the change in center of mass kinetic energy is the external object or objects exerting the force @xmath30 . of course , one case where this obtains is a single - particle system , which is the starting point for energy analysis in most introductory texts .",
    "while equation [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] says literally that the integral of the dot product of force and center of mass displacement equals a change in center of mass ( translational ) kinetic energy , many texts proceed to adopt @xmath31as a general definition of work and apply this definition outside its limited range of validity .",
    "as section ii shows , situations where external forces cause changes in internal energy are quite common and are almost always included among the examples and problems in these same introductory texts . conceptual confusion sets in when @xmath31 is called `` work '' but does not represent energy transfer through the system boundary .",
    "it is not equation [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] itself which is the problem , but its interpretation as a general definition of work which leads to conceptual difficulties .",
    "other authors @xciterecognize the limits of the definition and supplement equation [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] with a multi - particle energy equation while inventing names such as `` particle work '' or `` pseudo work '' to identify@xmath31 in troublesome situations . as an alternative ,",
    "i continue the mathematical development without applying names until i can clearly identify which integrals truly represent energy transferred through the system boundary .",
    "our investigation of two - particle models has produced two different types of force vs. distance integrals , which differ in the choice of external or internal variables for the position .",
    "for example , @xmath32 can be used to calculate an amount of energy transferred from external objects to particle 1 and stored internally by the system . on the other hand , @xmath33 ( which is part of @xmath31 because of equation [ eq : ext - f ] ) represents energy transferred from external objects to particle 1 and stored as translational kinetic energy of the system .",
    "in addition , these two integrals can be added to get : @xmath34 the right - hand side of this equation involves the total force from external objects on particle 1 as well as the total displacement of particle 1 .",
    "this is the total amount of energy transferred from external objects to particle 1 , and thus to the system . to be consistent with the thermodynamic definition of work as the energy transferred through the system boundary",
    ", this must be the work done by forces @xmath12 on the system .",
    "the left side of equation [ eq : f - dot - x - total - particle ] ( along with equations [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] and [ eq : dkeext+deint ] ) tells us that this total energy transfer accounts for a portion of the changes in internal energy and translational kinetic energy . while this may seem abstract , when solving elementary problems it is often possible to model the system as two particles , one particle located at the point of application of the force and another located at the center of mass and representing the rest of the object .",
    "from there , one can identify displacement of the center of mass , displacement of the first particle relative to the center of mass and total displacement of the particle .",
    "even when one or more of these displacements is unknowable , distinguishing among the three cases can aid an analysis of energy storage and transfer and help resolve confusion .",
    "the interpretation of force vs. displacement integrals in this paper , in particular the decision to apply the term work in general to equation [ eq : f - dot - x - total - particle ] but not equations [ eq : work - energy - eqn ] or [ eq : delta - e - int ] , is a direct consequence of adopting an appropriate mathematical model - one capable of representing internal energy because the system includes more than one particle - and strictly defining `` work '' in accord with thermodynamics , as the amount of energy transferred from external objects through the boundary of the system .",
    "mallinckrodt and leff@xcite define seven different force vs. displacement integrals that appear in the literature , but point out that only three of these are independent .",
    "starting with any three , the other four may be determined by simple mathematical relationships .",
    "my choice of three integrals is therefore a sufficient set and mathematically equivalent to prior formulations .",
    "mallinckrodt and leff generally regard this choice as the easiest set of three to understand and apply .",
    "finally , it should be noted that when external objects exert conservative forces on the multi - particle system , the system may be enlarged to include these objects and introduce external potential energy terms to the left - hand side of equation [ eq : dkeext+deint ] .",
    "however , changes to the internal energy may also occur if the forces in question are not uniform .",
    "tidal forces are one example of this , and they work precisely because non - uniform gravitational forces deform an object by displacing parts of it relative to the center of mass .",
    "use of two - particle models for elementary problems can help prepare students for the study of more advanced topics , such as tidal forces , when they encounter them later in their studies . in many cases ,",
    "the external conservative force is approximately uniform and will therefore cause only negligible changes in internal energy .",
    "zou and vanheuvelen outline a general problem - solving procedure when employing diagrams and graphs.@xcite the student first analyzes energy storage and transfer using the pie charts , bar graphs , and energy flow diagrams as in section ii . in the case of",
    "a deformable or rotating system , the guidelines developed in section iii help the student associate each energy formula with the appropriate energy transfer or storage mechanism .",
    "there are three displacements to examine for each external force : the displacement @xmath35 of the center of mass , the displacement @xmath36 - relative to the center of mass - of the particle to which the force is directly applied , and the total displacement @xmath37 of that particle .",
    "if the force is constant , @xmath38 will equal the change in translational kinetic energy ; @xmath39 equals the change in internal energy ; and @xmath40 equals the total energy transferred from the external object to the system , which is the work . for basic mechanics , the kinetic energy formula is also necessary .",
    "others , such as the specific heat formula , can be added as the course sequence dictates .",
    "the student associates each energy formula with one or more parts of the diagrams , and reads a conservation of energy equation from the overall structure . _",
    "the only necessary mathematical change to the curriculum is to provide students with the meaning of the above three products in lieu of defining work as @xmath38 .",
    "_ the mathematical manipulations achieved by this procedure are identical to those recommended by previous authors .",
    "the single particle energy model is discarded , and students learn a multi - particle theory first conceptually and then mathematically .",
    "when appropriate , the conservation of energy equation obtained by this procedure will automatically simplify to the single - particle work - energy equation .",
    "internal , external and total particle displacements for the two - puck - and - string problem . ]",
    "figure [ fig:2pucks - int - ext ] is a more complete diagram for the two - pucks - and - string problem from section ii , which reveals that the point of application of the force ( the center of the string ) has been displaced relative to the center of mass , causing the system to change shape .",
    "hence , we know that @xmath41 will not equal the work . instead , figure [ fig:2pucks - eqn - diagram ] shows how to correctly associate energy formulas with parts of the diagrams .",

    "al , sherwood and mungan obtain the same result,@xcite but the meaning of the force - displacement products derived from the two particle model provides a much more straightforward path to this solution . although one can not strictly model a rolling object with a two - particle model , the introduction of two - particle models earlier in the course sequence prepares students for a more sophisticated understanding of work and energy in rolling motion , as a comparison of the pairs of equal and opposite displacements in figures [ fig : skate - wall - detail ] and [ fig : roll - detail ] shows .",
    "one goal of a good introductory physics course should be for students to develop a useful model of energy and its conservation , one that they can employ to understand energy concepts throughout their lives .",
    "teachers must take care to present the material in a logical sequence so that concepts are continually refined and ideas build on one another . at the introductory level , the mathematics should be kept as simple as possible , but a certain level of complexity is necessary in order to support the development of correct energy concepts . in this conclusion ,",
    "i will outline some successful reforms of the pedagogical sequence for teaching energy , point out where two - particle models fit into this sequence , and show how the inclusion of two - particle models for some elementary problems can help prepare students for more advanced topics .    the overarching theme of eric brewe s doctoral disseration@xcite is `` energy early , energy often , energy intuition . ''",
    "he spends approximately the same amount of class time on energy as he would in a more standard course sequence , but instead of covering energy all at once , he weaves in an energy thread throughout . during the first week",
    ", he teaches students to represent their energy ideas qualitatively using pie charts and system schemas.@xcite at some point during each unit , he revisits energy by applying these representational tools to new situations , while gradually refining the existing tools and adding others - energy flow arrows on system schemas , bar graphs , equations and potential graphs .",
    "students do not use energy equations until they have developed a more sophisticated understanding of energy conservation .",
    "it is important that students practice using the diagrams and graphs to express energy ideas for some time before proceeding to equations .",
    "if they are comfortable with the representational tools , they will continue to use them as an aid to problem - solving .",
    "the result of brewe s reform is greater comfort with energy as a problem - solving alternative and a greater understanding of its relation to other topics.@xcite    within brewe s sequence , two - particle models should not be introduced until students understand how to apply the representational tools and equations to simpler situations .",
    "these include situations in which internal energy changes are negligible , as well as other cases , such as many inelastic or partially elastic collisions , where modeling objects as single particles that can store internal energy may be sufficient .",
    "in the two puck and string problem , for instance , we did just that when we assumed that a portion of the pucks kinetic energy was transferred to thermal energy when they collided .",
    "once students have an appropriate background , examples such as those from section ii can be used to help them refine their definition of work and to develop a deeper understanding of energy storage and transfer .",

    "a common bouncing ball occupies a pivotal point in the calculus - based college physics course as taught by dwayne desbian , and shows how students can be led to understand the difference between a single - particle and a multi - particle model.@xcite this situation contains basic elements of almost all of the examples in this paper .",
    "the floor causes the ball to flex as it comes momentarily to rest , in a manner similar to the way the brick wall crumples the car s front end . as the ball rebounds , some of the energy is restored to kinetic energy because of the elastic flexing of the ball s material .",
    "this energy does not come from the floor , but in a manner similar to the jumping person or the skater pushing off from the wall , it remains stored in the ball the entire time . even though the ball may store less kinetic energy after the bounce than before , that does not mean the energy has left the ball .",
    "similar to the car skidding to a stop , the energy is at least partially stored as thermal energy in the ball itself . through careful consideration of this problem using all of the different representations , students in desbian s course discover the failure of the single particle model and develop a model of the ball as two particles mediated by a linear restoring force .",
    "i showed in section iv how an early introduction to internal energy better prepares students to understand energy transfer when objects roll without slipping .",
    "students who continue their physics education will be exposed to ideas of internal energy and deformation in even more complicated contexts , including thermodynamics , molecular dynamics , solid - state physics , and atomic physics.@xcite in thermodynamics , students encounter difficulty understanding the work done on or by the working fluid of a heat engine .",
    "problems such as the skater and the car crash provide more concrete and familiar contexts in which to associate compression and expansion of the system with changes in internal energy .",
    "the two - particle , linear - restoring - force model of the bouncing ball is important in its own right .",
    "although seemingly simple , it contains the basic ideas of elastic behavior , and internal oscillations leading to thermal energy.@xcite in their introductory physics course , _ matter and interactions _",
    ", ruth chabay and bruce sherwood make innovative use of particles connected by linear restoring forces to demonstrate how bulk properties of matter emerge by applying basic mechanics to its constituent parts .",
    "this is the central concept of solid state physics .",
    "in atomic physics , absorption or emission of a photon leads to changes in the internal energy of an atom , accompanied by deformation in the form of changes in its size and shape .",
    "once students express atomic transitions using the familiar bar graphs and energy flow diagrams , they find energy level diagrams much easier to comprehend .",
    "tides and other phenomena due to the action of non - uniform fields can be understood through internal energy transfers accompanied by deformation .",
    "introducing two - particle models at the introductory level also exposes students to the idea of a model and its limits , and helps them to understand multi - body theory when they encounter it in an advanced physics course .",
    "teaching energy using multiple representations to promote student - to - student dialog is gaining currency among physics teachers .",
    "this paper is but the latest in a long series of efforts to deal with the mathematics of internal energy at the introductory level .",
    "both mathematical and visual approaches are finding their way into current textbooks . on the other hand , a unitary fluid - like metaphor for energy , a more rigorous expression of conservation of energy , an elevation of the importance of diagrams and graphs relative to equations , or the idea that @xmath71 does not , in general , equal work are counter - intuitive ideas to many trained physicists and introductory physics teachers .",
    "when they encounter these ideas in the per literature , it may well cause them to disregard the reform efforts .",
    "it is my hope that combining the mathematical and visual approaches and clarifying the mathematical and theoretical basis for these reforms will help some physicists and teachers take a closer look at the real value of the proposed changes .",
