    "for the schrdinger equation @xmath54 with a compactly supported potential @xmath55 which satisfies @xmath56 in @xmath57 , we can state the ite problem similarly .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced the ite problems on unbounded domains , considering perturbations which decrease exponentially at infinity .",
    "the system ( [ s1_eq_ite1euq])-([s1_eq_iteeuq ] ) is some kind of non - self - adjoint problem .",

    "these d - n map approaches are valid .",
    "more precisely , in this paper , we construct the poisson operator and the associated d - n map as elliptic singular integro - differential operators and we can compute exactly their symbols . using the ellipticity of the d - n map and the analytic fredholm theory , we can prove the discreteness of the set of ites .",
    "moreover , we consider a weyl type lower bound of the number of positive ites except for a small neighborhood of the origin .",

    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "as has been mentioned above , the main stream of our argument is based on lakshtanov and vainberg @xcite . in  2 ,",
    "we recall some basic properties of the dirichlet - to - neumann map . for our purpose , we need to study about residues and regular parts of the dirichlet - to - neumann map near its poles .",
    "the relation between ites and non - trivial kernels of the difference of dirichlet - to - neumann maps is also introduced here .",
    "finally , we construct an approximate solution of the dirichlet boundary value problems as a singular - integro differential operator , and we compute the symbol of the dirichlet - to - neumann map . under the preparation of  2 , we prove our main results in  3 .",
    "we use of the analytic fredholm theory , the parameter ellipticity of pseudo differential operators and weyl type asymptotic estimates for the number of dirichlet eigenvalues on compact manifolds .",
    "our main results are theorem [ s3_thm_discreteness ] for the discreteness of ites and theorem [ s3_thm_weylnt ] for the lower bound of the number of ites in @xmath71 with sufficiently small @xmath72 .",
