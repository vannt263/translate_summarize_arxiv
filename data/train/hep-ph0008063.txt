    "@xmath59-matrix unitarity requires that the @xmath7 couplings are momentum dependent form factors .",
    "we derived constraints on the low energy values of the @xmath7 form factors and the shape of the form factor from a partial wave analysis of the inelastic @xmath0 production amplitude in fermion antifermion annihilation ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unilim1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : unilim2 ] ) ) .",
    "the effects of anomalous @xmath7 couplings are enhanced at large energies .",
    "they lead to a broad increase in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution and in various transverse momentum distributions .",
    "we considered four signatures of @xmath0 production : @xmath133  leptons , @xmath311 , @xmath260 , and @xmath282 .",
    "the @xmath133  leptons channel is almost background free but suffers from a small event rate due to the small branching ratio for a @xmath23 pair decaying into four charged leptons .",
    "the rate for @xmath311 is approximately a factor six larger than that for @xmath133  leptons ; however , @xmath10 and @xmath198 production constitute non - negligible backgrounds at small values of @xmath276 .",
    "the @xmath260 and @xmath282 modes have larger branching ratios than the @xmath133  leptons and @xmath311 channels , but also much higher backgrounds .",
    "the main background source for the semi - hadronic final states is qcd @xmath123  jet production .",
    "the @xmath123  jet cross section is about a factor  20 ( 50 ) larger than the @xmath0 signal at the tevatron ( lhc ) .",
    "nevertheless , we found that these channels may be useful in searching for @xmath7 couplings .",
    "all @xmath7 couplings have similar high energy behavior .",
    "this makes it difficult to distinguish the various @xmath7 couplings in the transverse momentum and @xmath0 invariant mass distributions .",
    "we found that in the @xmath133  leptons and @xmath311 channels , the distributions of the lego plot separation , @xmath166 , and the angle in the transverse plane between the charged leptons , @xmath167 , may be useful to distinguish @xmath139 from @xmath49 and to determine the sign of @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath139 violate @xmath47 conservation , terms in the helicity amplitudes proportional to @xmath139 do not interfere with the sm helicity amplitudes , thus it is impossible to determine the sign of @xmath139 using the @xmath166 and @xmath167 distributions . in the semi - hadronic modes ,",
    "the @xmath0 signal is overwhelmed by the @xmath248 background in these distributions , even for rather large anomalous couplings .",
    "unfortunately , the two distributions will not be useful in distinguishing between @xmath163 and @xmath164 as they differ very little in shape for @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings .    in order to determine the bounds on the @xmath7 couplings which one can hope to achieve in future tevatron and lhc experiments , we have performed a @xmath293 test for the four different final states , using the @xmath120 and dijet transverse momentum distributions . at the tevatron , with an integrated luminosity of 2  fb@xmath18",
    ", one will be able to measure @xmath139 and @xmath49 with a precision of @xmath316 ( @xmath292 cl ) in the @xmath311 and @xmath282 channels for a form factor scale of @xmath96  gev .",
    "the limits obtained from the @xmath133  leptons and @xmath260 channels are a about a factor  2 and  1.5 weaker than those which can be achieved in the other two channels ( see table  [ tevlim ] ) . at the lhc with 100  fb@xmath18",
    ", the @xmath7 couplings can be measured with an accuracy of @xmath317 ( @xmath292 cl ) in @xmath318 for @xmath97  tev .",
    "the limits obtained from the other three channels are a factor  1.6 to  4 weaker ( see table  [ lhclim ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity limits which can be achieved at the tevatron in run  ii and the lhc should be compared with the bounds from recent measurements at lep2 and expectations for a future linear collider , as well as predictions from theory .",
    "the combined @xmath292 cl limits from the lep2 experiments presently are  @xcite @xmath319 it should be noted that the lep2 limits do not contain any form factor effects . for the form and scale chosen here , these effects weaken the limits by about @xmath307 . in run  ii",
    ", cdf and d  will be able to improve these bounds by at least a factor  3 to  6 . at a @xmath3 linear collider ( lc ) with @xmath320  gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath321  fb@xmath18 ,",
    "one expects to measure the @xmath7 couplings with a precision of  @xcite @xmath322 ( @xmath292 cl ) .",
    "this is comparable to the bounds which one hopes to achieve at the lhc .",
    "one loop corrections in the sm , in supersymmetric models , and in models with heavy fermions , induce @xmath7 couplings which are of @xmath54 or less .    in view of our present poor knowledge of the @xmath7 couplings ,",
    "the direct measurement of these couplings in run  ii and at the lhc will constitute major progress .",
    "however , it will be very difficult to achieve a precision which will make it possible to test the sm one loop prediction for the @xmath7 couplings .",
