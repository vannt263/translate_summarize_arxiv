    "the measurement of the temperature dependence of the rate constant is one of the important tools of chemical kinetics in determining mechanisms of chemical reactions.@xcite significant deviations from a simple exponential behavior can be evidence of tunneling and of other nuclear quantum effects.@xcite these effects are particularly strong for hydrogen transfer reactions with a high activation barrier or at low temperatures .",
    "recently , however , quantum effects have been observed also in many enzymatic reactions at physiological temperatures.@xcite it therefore becomes more and more important to have accurate theoretical methods for computing the temperature dependence of the rate constant.@xcite    probably the oldest yet still the best known expression for the thermal rate constant @xmath6 at temperature @xmath7 is the empirical arrhenius law,@xcite@xmath8 here @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 the activation energy , and the temperature dependence is purely exponential .",
    "an improvement over the arrhenius law was provided by the transition state theory ( tst),@xcite in which @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the planck s constant , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the partition functions of the transition state and the reactants , respectively , and @xmath15 is the barrier height for the reaction . here",
    "the temperature dependence includes a fractional power @xmath16 in addition to the exponential .",
    "nevertheless , both arrhenius law and tst are basically purely classical , so they can not take into account tunneling and other nuclear quantum effects .",
    "although the simplest quantum effects _ can _ be taken into account within the tst in an _ ad hoc _ fashion , by replacing the partition functions by their quantum analogs for the simple harmonic oscillator ( which takes into account the zero - point energy , the wigner tunneling correction,@xcite and approximate quantization of the vibrational motion ) , a more systematic approach requires quantum treatment of the nuclear motion .",
    "this is of course extremely difficult , and therefore various approximate yet accurate methods have been developed .",
    "these include , e.g. , the semiclassical methods@xcite or the so - called quantum transition state theories.@xcite    in this paper , we evaluate the temperature dependence of the rate constant starting from the quantum instanton ( qi ) approximation.@xcite this quantum transition state theory has been shown to describe correctly not only all of the above - mentioned quantum effects , but also corner - cutting , coupling of vibrational and rotational motions , multiple tunneling paths , etc . as we evaluate the temperature dependence of the rate constant directly , we can speed up the qi  calculation significantly by avoiding the tedious umbrella sampling necessary for computing the rate constant itself . furthermore ,",
    "if it is only the temperature dependence of the rate constant that is needed , we can increase the accuracy of the qi approximation for the rate constant by canceling some small remaining systematic errors .",
    "this can be useful , e.g. , if we know @xmath17 at a temperature @xmath18 very accurately and would like to know @xmath6 at other temperatures .",
    "the temperature dependence of the rate constant is computed via a thermodynamic integration @xcite with respect to the inverse temperature .",
    "a similar thermodynamic integration in the framework of the qi model was used by ceotto and miller to compute the rate constant for several one and two - dimensional systems using a discrete variable representation.@xcite below , we develop a general thermodynamic integration procedure based on the path integral implementation , which is suitable for many - dimensional systems .",
    "the method is tested on two simple systems for which exact quantum dynamical calculations are feasible : the eckart barrier and the full nine - dimensional h @xmath0h@xmath1  h@xmath2 h reaction .",
    "while the former system is the simplest one - dimensional model of a bimolecular reaction , the latter is the simplest bimolecular chemical reaction with an energy barrier . as such ,",
    "it has been widely studied and attained the status of a benchmark reaction.@xcite despite the apparent simplicity , this reaction remains a challenging test for new approximations .",
    "this is due to the presence of strong quantum effects , as the lightest atoms are involved in both bond breaking and bond formation .",
    "this reaction was investigated not only for the temperature dependence of its rate constant , but also for the kinetic isotope effect,@xcite the presence of the geometric phase effect,@xcite etc .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the methodology , i.e. , the qi approximation , the thermodynamic integration with respect to the inverse temperature , the path integral formalism , and the relevant estimators . computational details and ,",
    "in particular , the analysis of various errors are presented in sec .",
    "section iv contains the results .",
    "first , it is shown how the low and high temperature limits are obtained .",
    "the numerical results for the eckart barrier and the h@xmath19h@xmath20 reaction are then presented .",
    "the results are compared with the arrhenius law , tst , tst with the wigner tunneling correction , and the exact quantum calculation .",
    "finally , we discuss how the efficiency is related to the dependence of the statistical error on the number of imaginary time slices in the path integral , and how this error , in turn , depends on the system under study .",

    "we have carefully separated these four contributions and attempted to make the first three contributions small in comparison with the error of the qi . in more complicated systems , this may not be possible and especially the final statistical error may be comparable to or larger than the error of the qi . because the exponentiation of the ti is quite sensitive to various errors , a detailed analysis of errors",
    "was carried out for the ratio @xmath101 , i.e. , over the largest temperature range , where the first three types of errors are the greatest .",
    "the ti was evaluated by four different numerical methods , namely the trapezoidal , simpson , simpson @xmath102 , and boole methods.@xcite    comparing the analytical bounds on the _ discretization errors _ of the ti integrals using a numerical estimate of a higher order derivative,@xcite one can conclude that both the simpson and simpson 3/8 methods were much better than the trapezoidal rule and that the boole method did not provide any further improvement . specifically , for the eckart barrier the error of the ratio due to the discretization of the ti was @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , or @xmath106 for the trapezoidal , simpson , simpson @xmath102 , or boole methods , respectively . for the h+h@xmath20 reaction , the discretization error of the final ratio was @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , or @xmath108 , in the same order .",
    "it should be emphasized that these error estimates are very conservative , as the actual difference between the final ratios based on different methods was an order of magnitude smaller than what one would expect from the error estimates .",
    "the final results displayed in the plots used the simpson method .",
    "the _ statistical _ rmses were estimated with the block averaging method using a variable block size @xcite to remove correlation of the pimc data .",
    "the statistical error of the ti was evaluated using an appropriate formula for each integration method and assuming that the statistical errors of energies at different temperatures were uncorrelated .",
    "as expected , the statistical error did not depend much on the integration method , and was always close to the statistical error for the simpson method .",
    "the statistical error of the final ratio was @xmath108 for the eckart barrier and @xmath110 for the h+h@xmath20 reaction .",
    "the _ finite _ @xmath58 _ error _ , i.e. , the error due to the discretization of the feynman pi , was obtained by repeating calculations of all quantities at all temperatures with twice smaller numbers of beads ( @xmath111 ) and then extrapolating each quantity to @xmath66 , assuming @xmath112 convergence .",
    "we emphasize that we used the extrapolated results only for estimating the finite @xmath58 error of the computed ratio and _ not _ for estimating the ratio itself , which could be dangerous .",
    "the finite @xmath58 error of the ratio was @xmath113 for the eckart barrier and @xmath114 for the h+h@xmath20 reaction .",
    "[ we note that for h+h@xmath20 one of the temperatures ( @xmath115 , a temperature in the vicinity of which a sharp bend in the @xmath116 dependence occurs ) required a five times longer simulation to reduce the ti discretization errors .",
    "this was because a small statistical error had a huge effect on the estimate of the fourth derivative and hence on the analytical estimate of the discretization error . ]    to sum up , in both systems the ti discretization error was negligible to the statistical and finite @xmath58 errors , which , in turn , were small in comparison to the error of the qi approximation .",
    "at high temperatures , the rate constant is expected to behave classically and follow the arrhenius law or the more accurate tst result . whereas the arrhenius law ( [ k_arrh ] ) predicts the rate constant ratio to be a simple exponential function of the inverse temperature , @xmath117 tst ( [ k_tst ] ) gives the ratio of rate constants @xmath118 in particular , assuming the partition functions @xmath119 and @xmath51 to be separable into products of classical rotational and vibrational partition functions , the temperature dependence ( [ tdep_tst ] )  of tst rate constant includes an additional fractional power law besides the exponential dependence in the arrhenius law ( [ tdep_arrh ] ) .    at somewhat lower temperatures , when quantum effects start to play a role , the basic tst expression ( [ tdep_tst ] ) can be improved in several ways : first , classical partition functions @xmath51 and @xmath120  can be replaced by their exact quantum analogs for a harmonic potential .",

    "[ fig : h3_evsp_adhoc ] shows that while the statistical error of the cve is approximately constant as a function of @xmath58 , the rmses of the te  and ve grow with @xmath58 .",
    "however , in this case , the results are quite well converged for @xmath154 and at this point the rmse of the cve is still larger than the rmse of the te , although it is already smaller than the rmse of the ve .",

    "a general method for the direct evaluation of the temperature dependence of the quantum rate constant was presented .",
    "the main advantage of this method is the increased efficiency : evaluating the temperature dependence directly , without computing the rate constant at any given temperature , allows us to avoid a tedious umbrella sampling procedure .",
    "besides efficiency , the direct calculation of the temperature dependence of the rate constant can also improve the accuracy : our ratios @xmath157 for both the eckart barrier and the @xmath158 reaction have somewhat smaller relative errors than the errors obtained for the absolute qi rate constants in previous studies of these systems.@xcite the smaller relative error in the ratio of rate constants is due to a favorable cancellation of various systematic errors , such as the systematic error of about @xmath159 of the qi model at high temperatures ( that can also be removed by an ad hoc correction of @xmath72)@xcite and small recrossing effects in the @xmath141 reaction , also at high temperatures .",
    "it is noteworthy that for both reactions , the rmses of transition state energies depend on the strength of the constraint . weakening the constraint",
    "facilitates sampling of the configuration space and the error of the cve decreases , approaching the well - known unconstrained situation where the cve is typically the optimal estimator .",
    "however , at the same time the constraint must be strong enough to exert the constraining effect and describe the situation near the transition state properly . as a result ,",
    "`` ranking '' of the estimators is not universal but can change with the potential used as a constraint and is in general different from the ranking for unconstrained simulations .",
    "the dependence of the error of the ve on @xmath58 is best understood in terms of the ring polymer interpretation@xcite of the discretized pi : the quantum thermodynamics of the original system can be interpreted as the classical thermodynamics of the ring polymer .",
    "the constrained pi simulation for the one - dimensional eckart barrier is completely bound , resulting in the rmse independent of @xmath58 . in the full - dimensional hydrogen exchange reaction , on the other hand , even the constrained simulation allows the system to move as a whole .",
    "this is exactly where the ve is known to have a rmse increasing with @xmath58 .",
    "the cve estimator is usually the optimal estimator in unconstrained systems with some translational ( i.e. , free - particle ) degrees of freedom . in a system in which only two slices are bound ( in our case ,",
    "slices @xmath160 and @xmath58 ) , the symmetry between different slices is lost and so is , to some extent , the advantage of subtracting the centroid .",
    "this explains why the rmse of the ve can sometimes be smaller than the rmse of the cve for all values of @xmath58 , which we observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : eckart_evsp_adhoc ] and [ fig : eckart_evsp_rigorous ] .    to sum up , while in generic systems at very low temperatures , the cve is expected to be the optimal estimator for energy , at finite temperatures in constrained simulations , the ve or even the te can have the smallest rmse .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can serve as a guide for choosing the best estimator for a given system .",
    "however , since the additional cost of evaluating all three estimators is negligible in comparison to the cost of the pimc random walk or pimd simulation , we recommend computing all three estimators , evaluating their rmses , and using the one with the smallest rmse in a given situation .",
