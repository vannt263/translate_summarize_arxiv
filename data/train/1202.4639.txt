    "constructing initial data in general relativity requires solving the constraint equations of einstein s field equations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . under the assumption of conformal flatness and maximal slicing , solutions to the _ momentum constraint _ describing boosted or spinning back holes can be expressed analytically in terms of bowen - york solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions can then be inserted into the _ hamiltonian constraint _ , which , in general , has to be solved numerically for the conformal factor .",
    "any numerical method employed to solve the hamiltonian constraint for black hole data has to accommodate the presence of black hole singularities .",
    "one approach is the _ excision method _ , in which the black hole interior is excised from the numerical grid , and suitable boundary conditions are imposed on the black hole horizon ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative is the _ puncture method _ , in which the singular parts of the solution are expressed in terms of an analytical background solution , and the hamiltonian constraint is solved for a regular correction to the background solution @xcite .",
    "here we discuss an alternative approach that requires neither excision nor a decomposition into background and correction ( even though the latter is probably desirable in terms of numerical accuracy ) . specifically , we consider solving the hamiltonian constraint for an inverse power of the conformal factor .",
    "this approach , which is similar to an approach that has become extremely successful in solving einstein s evolution equations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , appears to be promising in the context of einstein s constraint equations as well .",
    "the new function representing the conformal factor remains finite everywhere and can be solved for directly .",
    "we present numerical examples and compare with both analytical and independent numerical results .",
    "an important advantage of this approach over the puncture method is that it can be used without modification even when , in the puncture method , the correction diverges as fast as the background solution itself .",
    "we demonstrate this feature for rotating black holes in the trumpet topology @xcite .",
    "we expect that this property may be important for applications that relax the assumption of conformal flatness , since a non - vanishing deviation from conformal flatness may lead , in the context of the puncture method , to singular corrections to the analytic background terms .",
    "in vacuum , and under the assumption of maximal slicing and conformal flatness , the hamiltonian constraint reduces to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the conformal factor and @xmath2 is the conformally rescaled , trace - free part of the extrinsic curvature . also , @xmath3 is the covariant derivative operator with respect to the conformally related metric @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the physical spatial metric . under the assumption of conformal flatness , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the flat metric any coordinate system",
    ", the operator @xmath8 reduces to the flat laplace operator",
    ".    now consider a new function @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant that we will later choose to be a positive integer .",
    "since the conformal factor @xmath1 typically diverges at the black hole singularity , this choice makes @xmath11 go to zero and remain finite there .",
    "the laplace operator acting on @xmath11 then satisfies @xmath12 inserting ( [ ham1 ] ) we can now express the hamiltonian constraint in terms of @xmath11 , @xmath13 evidently we recover the hamiltonian constraint in its original form ( [ ham1 ] ) for @xmath14 .    different choices for the power @xmath10 can be considered .",
    "one possibility would be to choose @xmath10 in such a way that that the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ ham2 ] ) remains finite at the black hole singularity , where @xmath11 vanishes . assuming that @xmath1 diverges with @xmath15 at the singularity , where @xmath16 is the isotropic radius",
    ", @xmath11 scales with @xmath17 , and the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ ham2 ] ) with @xmath18 .",
    "this term remains finite as @xmath19 if @xmath20 .",
    "for the minimum value , @xmath21 , we always have @xmath22 close to the singularity .",
    "the scaling of @xmath1 close to the singularity depends on the slicing of the black hole .",
    "for so - called wormhole data , for example , @xmath1 diverges with @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 . here",
    "we will focus on trumpet data , for which @xmath25 close to the singularity ( see @xcite and equation ( [ psi0 ] ) below ) . the above argument",
    "would then suggests that we should choose @xmath26 . despite these considerations",
    ", @xmath27 may not be the best choice .",
    "as we will discuss in more detail below , we found better results for @xmath28 , even though some terms in ( [ ham2 ] ) diverge with @xmath29 for this choice .    before proceeding we linearize the hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham2 ] ) as follows . denoting the approximate solution after @xmath30 iteration steps with @xmath31",
    ", we search for a correction @xmath32 so that @xmath33 solves the equation . denoting the residual of equation ( [ ham2 ] ) for @xmath31 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 where we have",
    "abbreviated @xmath36 , the linearized hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham2 ] ) becomes @xmath37 equation ( [ hamlin2 ] ) is a linear equation that can be solved iteratively for @xmath38 until the norm of the residual @xmath34 has dropped below a desired tolerance .",
    "for a schwarzschild black hole , for @xmath28 and @xmath27 . here",
    "we imposed the outer boundary at @xmath39 and used @xmath40 gridpoints .",
    "the upper panels shows the solution for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "as expected , @xmath11 scales with @xmath42 at the center .",
    "the lower panel shows the rescaled errors @xmath43 , demonstrating second - order convergence to the analytical solution , even in the neighborhood of the singularity.,width=288 ]    as a first test of this scheme we solve the hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham2 ] ) in spherical symmetry to construct the schwarzschild solution .    we adopt a finite - difference method and",
    "use a uniform vertex - centered grid so that the first grid point is at @xmath44 .",
    "we set @xmath45 at @xmath44 , and set @xmath11 to its analytical value @xmath46 at the outer boundary @xmath47 of the grid .",
    "finite - differencing the operator on the left - hand side of equation ( [ hamlin2 ] ) results in a tridiagonal matrix that can be solved with elementary methods .    in order to construct maximally",
    "sliced trumpet - data , we adopt @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the spatial normal vector pointing away from the center of the black hole at @xmath44 , and @xmath50 is the total mass - energy of the black hole . into a background and a correction term , the mass of the resulting black hole is specified by the extrinsic curvature .",
    "wormhole data , for which the extrinsic curvature vanishes , therefore do require a split of @xmath11 into background and correction , since otherwise the mass remains undetermined . ] the analytical solution for @xmath51 can also be given analytically , albeit only in parametric form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the neighborhood of the singularity , @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 to leading order in @xmath16 . throughout this paper , @xmath50 ,",
    "denotes the mass of the background schwarzschild solution .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show numerical results as a function of the radius @xmath16 for two choices @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the upper panel shows the solutions @xmath11 for different grid resolutions ; as the resolution increases , the numerical solutions approach the analytical solution @xmath53 .",
    "as expected , @xmath11 scales with @xmath42 close to the center .",
    "the lower panel shows the errors @xmath54 , rescaled with the square of the grid - spacing .",
    "these results demonstrate that the scheme is second - order accurate even in the vicinity of the black hole singularity .",
    "they also demonstrate that this method can be adopted without decomposing the solution into a background and a correction term , even though we will use such a decomposition in the next sections .",
    "the choice @xmath27 has the appealing features that the first term on the right hand side of ( [ ham2 ] ) remains finite , as we discussed above , and that @xmath11 is smooth at the center .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that for @xmath28 the numerical errors are smaller .",
    "we have also found that for @xmath27 our iterative scheme failed to converge for rapidly spinning black holes ( see section [ sec : rotbh ] below ) .",
    "we will therefore focus on @xmath28 for the remainder of this paper .       for boosted black holes with momentum @xmath55 .",
    "the lines in the large plot show results for @xmath56 , obtained for @xmath28 , on three different numerical grids with increasing grid resolution and more distant outer boundaries . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the outer boundaries were imposed at @xmath58 , for @xmath59 at @xmath60 , and for @xmath61 at @xmath62 . also included , as crosses , are the results as computed from the hamiltonian constraint in its original from ( [ ham1 ] ) with @xmath63 .",
    "the insert shows higher - resolution results ( obtained with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) of the region around the black hole center .",
    "this graph also includes the leading - order analytical result ( [ w_boost ] ) as a solid line.,width=288 ]    we construct boosted trumpet black holes by adding to the schwarzschild extrinsic curvature ( [ a_0 ] ) a bowen - york solution representing a black hole with momentum @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( since the momentum constraint is linear , the sum of two solutions is still a solution ) . in the interest of numerical accuracy",
    ", we decompose @xmath11 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the analytical schwarzschild solution , and @xmath56 a correction .",
    "this way the largest terms in the hamiltonian constraint can be computed from the analytical solution , and only the correction @xmath56 needs to be treated with finite - differencing .",
    "the iteration for @xmath56 still works in the same way as before if we replace @xmath31 in ( [ hamlin2 ] ) with @xmath69 , and @xmath38 with @xmath70 .",
    "we now solve ( [ ham2 ] ) , using the iteration ( [ hamlin2 ] ) , on a three - dimensional , uniform cartesian grid of @xmath71 gridpoints , with the help of both cactus and petsc software .",
    "we again adopt a vertex - centered grid , fix @xmath72 at the center , and impose a @xmath29 fall - off condition at the outer boundaries on a square @xmath73 .",
    "boosted trumpet black holes have previously been constructed with the puncture method by solving the hamiltonian constraint in its original form ( [ ham1 ] ) ( see @xcite , see also @xcite for a calculation using the excision method ) . in that approach ,",
    "the conformal factor @xmath1 is decomposed as @xmath74 .",
    "given a solution @xmath75 , we can compute the corresponding @xmath56 from ( [ omega_decomp ] ) , @xmath76 for boosted black holes , we can therefore compare the results from the new method discussed here with independent numerical results .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , regular solutions for @xmath75 for boosted trumpet black holes in the neighborhood of the puncture are given , to leading order in @xmath16 , by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "inserting this , together with ( [ psi0 ] ) , into ( [ w_from_u ] ) we find @xmath79 to lowest order in @xmath16 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show numerical results for a black hole boosted with a momentum @xmath55 .",
    "the graph shows that , as both the resolution and the distance to the outer boundaries are increased , the results for @xmath56 approach those computed with the puncture method from @xmath75 .",
    "note that @xmath56 and @xmath75 feature different asymptotic behavior as @xmath80 . by imposing a @xmath29 fall - off on both functions at a finite @xmath81",
    ", we suppress different higher - order terms .",
    "therefore , the results from the two approaches only approach each other as both the numerical resolution and the location of the outer boundaries are increased .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows higher - resolution results for the region around the singularity , and demonstrates that the numerical results , for both @xmath56 and @xmath75 , approach the analytical result ( [ w_boost ] ) as @xmath19 .",
