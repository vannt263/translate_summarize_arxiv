    "( ii ) the temperature dependence of @xmath266 from experiments on quasi - one - dimensional ferromagnetic metal wires@xcite could fit a @xmath245-dependence in some data sets .",
    "a problem with extracting this power law dependence from the data is that the value of the dephasing length is so short ( see above ) , that @xmath267 becomes comparable to the transverse dimensions of the wires in a significant range of temperatures .",
    "this makes it difficult to convert the measured quantity ( the rms value of the conductance fluctuations or the correlation field or bias voltage ) unambiguously into a temperature dependence of @xmath267 , since the relation between these quantities and @xmath267 depends qualitatively on the effective dimensionality of the system.@xcite ( iii ) the measured indicators of quantum coherence ( such as noise power of time - dependent conductance fluctuations , @xcite or correlation bias voltage@xcite ) seem to be largely invariant when the external magnetic field is increased over a range of several tesla .",
    "this , too , seems to indicate that the interaction with spin waves is not the dominant mechanism of dephasing at low temperatures , since one expects an exponential suppression of the spin - wave - induced dephasing rate when @xmath268 .",
    "however , at temperatures @xmath269 , where we theoretically expect spin waves to start playing a role ( we estimated @xmath257  k , see above , which corresponds to magnetic fields",

    "we close with a remark comparing the present calculation and the calculation of the dephasing time from electron - electron interactions.@xcite there are two important differences between these two calculations .",
    "first , for coulomb interactions the dephasing rate for a quasi - one - dimensional geometry can not be obtained in perturbation theory , but instead needs a self - consistency argument to cut off an otherwise divergent integral .",
    "no such divergence occurred in the present calculation .",
    "second , the calculation of the dephasing rate from electron - electron interactions that enters the conductance fluctuations requires the calculation of a more complicated object than the simple diffuson propagator we consider.@xcite the origin of the difference is twofold : ( i ) the coulomb interaction becomes effectively long range at low frequencies @xmath117 , whereas the spin - wave - mediated interaction remains short range even at small @xmath117 because of the exchange splitting @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , since every interaction with the spin waves involves an electronic spin flip , correlations over distances larger than @xmath271 $ ] are strongly suppressed by the exchange splitting .",
    "( ii ) the divergence at @xmath121 and the resulting @xmath272 in our calculation ( corresponding to a static magnetization pointing in a random direction ) is cut off by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , physically pinning the magnetization to a fixed direction .",

    "this work is supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation in the framework of the alexander von humboldt professorship programme , endowed by the federal ministry of education and research .",
    "the diffuson propagator describes the coherent propagation of two quantum mechanical probability amplitudes .",
    "the effect of spin waves on the propagation is qualitatively different for the cases that these amplitudes describe propagation through the sample at the same time , or at different times .",
    "the former case is relevant , e.g. , for a calculation of the disorder - averaged conductance , whereas the latter scenario is relevant , e.g. , for the calculation of the conductance fluctuations.@xcite diagrammatically , the difference between the two cases is that all spin - wave - mediated interaction lines have to be included in the former case ( diagrams of fig .",
