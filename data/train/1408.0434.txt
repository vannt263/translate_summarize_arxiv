    "we find that the critical buckling strain increases linearly with the increase of the strain rate , and this strain rate effect becomes more important for longer slmos@xmath0 .",
    "the critical strain is almost temperature - independent in low - temperature regions , but it increases considerably with increasing temperature for temperatures above 50  k , because the buckling deformation is repaired by the thermal vibration at higher temperatures . we show that the critical strain depends on the length ( @xmath3 ) as @xmath4 , which is in good agreement with the prediction of @xmath5 from the euler buckling theory .",

    "it indicates that the strain rate has stronger effect for longer slmos@xmath0 , because the frequency of the buckling mode ( first lowest - frequency normal mode ) is lower in longer system , leading to longer response time . that is the buckling mode in a longer slmos@xmath0 requires longer relaxation time for its occurrence .",
