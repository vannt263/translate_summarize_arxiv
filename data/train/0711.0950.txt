    "a remarkable property of gauge theories is the existence of topologically non - trivial configurations of gauge fields @xcite . in minkowski space - time , these configurations are associated with tunneling between different states which are related by topologically non - trivial gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "these different states are characterized by the chern - simons topological charge @xcite .",
    "transitions between these different states which involve changes in the topological charge induce anomalous processes , that is , processes which are forbidden by the classical equations of motion of the theory , but when the theory is quantized , become allowed @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of such transitions vanish order by order in perturbation theory , and are associated with intrinsically non - perturbative phenomena involving many quanta . in electroweak theory ,",
    "such transitions are associated with @xmath2 violation , where @xmath3 is baryon number and @xmath4 is lepton number . in qcd , they are tied to chirality non - conservation .",
    "chirality conservation is an exact symmetry of the classical equations of motion of qcd and of perturbation theory in the zero quark mass limit .",
    "the zero quark mass limit should be a good approximation for high energy processes    it was originally thought that non - perturbative phenomena associated with the underlying topology were suppressed by factors such as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the interaction strength of the gauge theory .",
    "this is typical of results from computation of quantum tunneling between states with different topological charge .",
    "it was a surprise when manton and klinkhamer proposed that for processes at high temperature , that the exponential suppression might disappear @xcite .",
    "this is because at high temperatures , there is sufficient energy to pass classically over the barrier which separates states of different topological charge .",
    "kuzmin , rubakov and shaposhnikov argued that the rate would be sufficiently large so that these processes might be important for electroweak baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the rates for such processes were computed @xcite , and it was eventually understood that such rates were not exponentially suppressed because they involved the coherent interaction of many low ",
    "energy quanta in an initial state going to many quanta in a final state @xcite .",
    "such rates should be large therefore not only at finite temperature but also in out  of  equilibrium processes which involve many particles .",
    "it was also shown that the computations for electroweak baryon number violation have a counterpart in helicity non - conservation in qcd @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the transitions changing topological charge is that they involve @xmath7 and @xmath8odd field configurations .",
    "because of this , @xmath7 and @xmath9invariance of strong interactions is no longer `` natural '' .",
    "these symmetries can however be imposed dynamically by postulating the existence of axions @xcite ; see @xcite for reviews . in any case",
    ", @xmath7 and @xmath8invariance of strong interactions has to be related to the vacuum structure .",
    "it is thus possible that an excited vacuum domain which may be produced in heavy ion collisions as proposed by lee and wick @xcite can break parity and and @xmath8 spontaneously @xcite .",
    "some consequences of such a scenario had been studied by morley and schmidt @xcite , who proposed as a signature @xmath8odd correlations between the spins of the protons produced in a heavy ion collision .",
    "other realizations of an excited vacuum domain ( including the ones with parity  odd fluctuations ) have been considered in refs @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition qcd vacuum can possess metastable domains leading to @xmath10 and @xmath11 violation @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that this phenomenon would manifest itself in specific correlations of pion momenta @xcite .",
    "( for related studies of metastable vacuum states , especially in supersymmetric theories , see @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath10odd bubbles had been inferred from the analysis of an effective chiral theory incorporating axial anomaly @xcite ; such bubbles may also be viewed as the space  time domains occupied by gauge field configurations with non ",
    "trivial winding number .",
    "the existence of metastable @xmath7odd bubbles does not contradict the vafa ",
    "witten theorem @xcite stating that @xmath7 and @xmath11 can not be broken in the true ground state of qcd for @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , this theorem does not apply to qcd matter at finite isospin density @xcite and finite temperature @xcite , where lorentz  non - invariant @xmath7odd operators are allowed to have non - zero expectation values . for matter at zero temperature and finite baryon density , migdal @xcite long time ago advocated the possibility of parity  breaking pion condensate phase ( for a recent work on @xmath13violation in cold dense matter , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "degenerate vacuum states with opposite parity were found @xcite in the superconducting phase of qcd .",
    "a parity broken phase also exists in lattice qcd with wilson fermions @xcite , but this phenomenon has been recognized as a lattice artifact for the case of mass  degenerate quarks ; spontaneous @xmath7 and @xmath11 breaking similar to the dashen s phenomenon @xcite can however occur for non  physical values of quark masses @xcite .",
    "@xmath7even , but @xmath14odd metastable states have also been argued to exist in hot gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the conditions for the applicability of vafa - witten theorem have been repeatedly re  examined in recent years @xcite .",
    "several dynamical scenarios for the decay of @xmath7odd bubbles have been considered @xcite , and numerical lattice calculations of the fluctuations of topological charge in classical yang ",
    "mills fields have been performed @xcite .",
    "a closely related topic is the role of topological effects in high  energy scattering and multi  particle production which has been studied in refs @xcite .",
    "the studies of @xmath7 and @xmath11odd correlations of pion momenta @xcite have shown that such measurements are in principle feasible but would require large event samples .",
    "0.3 cm    some time ago , it was pointed out that the presence of non  zero angular momentum ( or equivalently of magnetic field ) in heavy ion collisions makes it possible for @xmath7 and @xmath11odd domains to induce charge separation in the produced particles @xcite .",
    "this is because the @xmath7 and @xmath15breaking term carries net chirality and thus generates asymmetry between left and right  handed fermions @xmath16 . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "a @xmath7 and @xmath11odd domain can generate chirality not by flipping the spins of the quarks , but by inducing up ",
    "down asymmetry ( as measured with respect to the symmetry axis of the angular momentum ) in the production of quarks and anti ",
    "quarks @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the effect has been estimated , and found to be within experimental reach . a very useful experimental observable measuring the charge separation with respect to reaction plane ( which is perpendicular to the angular momentum and magnetic field axis ) has been proposed by voloshin @xcite shortly afterwards . the first result of a dedicated experimental study of the effect has been recently presented by the star collaboration at rhic @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been noticed that the effect of charge separation can also be understood in the following way . at finite @xmath17angle ( as present effectively in a @xmath10 and @xmath11-odd vacuum domain ) ,",
    "a magnetic field @xmath18 induces through the axial anomaly a parallel electric field @xmath19 , and a corresponding electric dipole moment .",
    "one may consider as a theoretical illustration of this phenomenon the transformation , at finite @xmath17 , of a magnetic monopole into a `` dyon '' with an electric charge @xmath20 demonstrated by witten @xcite .",
    "in an off - central heavy ion collision , a @xmath10 and @xmath11-odd vacuum domain was shown @xcite to induce an electric field perpendicular to the reaction plane of magnitude @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angular momentum in a collision at impact parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding electric charge separation has been estimated and found amenable to experimental observation .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a novel mechanism for charge separation .",
    "the topological charge changing transitions provide the @xmath7 and @xmath11 violation necessary for charge separation .",
    "the variance of the net topological charge change is proportional to the total number of topological charge changing transitions .",
    "hence if sufficiently hot matter is created in heavy ion collisions so that topological charge transitions can take place , we expect on average in each event a finite amount of topological charge change .",
    "charge separation needs a symmetry axis along which the separation can take place .",
    "the only symmetry axis in a heavy ion collision is angular momentum which points in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane . in central collisions",
    "there is no symmetry axis , so in that case charge separation should vanish .",
    "if charge separation would manifest itself mainly into pions it should violate isospin symmetry ( interchange of up and down quarks ) .",
    "this is because under an isospin transformation a @xmath24 becomes a @xmath25 meson , so in an isospin symmetric situation @xmath24 should behave similar to @xmath25 , hence in that case they can never separate . isospin violation can occur because up and down quarks have a different mass , because our initial state could be isospin asymmetric , and because up and down quarks have different charge , or because of the presence of an electromagnetic field .",
    "since qcd contains configurations that break the @xmath1 symmetry , but not the @xmath26 symmetry , the charge separation mechanism we are looking for should not violate @xmath26 .",
    "however , a particle with positive charge transforms to a particle with negative charge under charge conjugation . in order to maintain @xmath26 invariance , some important ingredient of the mechanism that separates charge should transform under @xmath26 as well .",
    "the only possibility lies in the initial state , since the incoming ions have a positive electric charge , they transform under @xmath26 .",
    "so our mechanism should somehow depend on the electric charges of the ions .",
    "summarizing , the charge separation mechanism should provide a symmetry axis , it should violate isospin and depend on the charges of the colliding ions .",
    "therefore it is very natural that the ( electromagnetic ) magnetic field is crucial for charge separation .",
    "this magnetic field depends on the electric charges of the colliding nuclei , so that @xmath26 invariance is maintained .",
    "the magnetic field provides a symmetry axis ; midway between the two colliding nuclei , the magnetic field is parallel to the angular momentum vector .",
    "moreover the magnetic field causes violation of isospin since up and down quarks will be polarized oppositely in a magnetic field .",
    "we can understand the effect we will discuss in this article in a simple example .",
    "suppose we have a box with some net topological charge .",
    "this means that due to the anomaly , there is a net helicity for the quarks inside the box .",
    "if the box is at high enough temperature , then perturbative interactions which involve spin flip are negligible , since @xmath27 , so the net helicity is directly proportional to the net topological charge .",
    "now imagine we apply an electrodynamic magnetic field .",
    "this will orient the spin of positively charged quarks ( and anitquarks ) along the direction of the magnetic field , due to the magnetic moment interaction .",
    "likewise , the spins of negatively charged quarks ( and anitquarks ) will become oriented opposite to the direction of magnetic field .",
    "now because there is net helicity , the orientation of spin is preferentially in the direction of momentum of the particles .",
    "positively charged quarks and antiquarks move in the direction of the magnetic field , and negatively charged quarks and antiquarks move opposite to it . therefore an electromagnetic current is set up in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we therefore call this the chiral magnetic effect . the chiral magnetic effect",
    "induces a vector current . for systems of a finite size ,",
    "this current results in charge separation or an induced electric dipole moment .",
    "the separation is as required @xmath26 even , since under @xmath26 both the magnetic field and the vector current change sign . under @xmath13 , the current changes sign , but the magnetic field does not , so it is @xmath13 odd , and @xmath1 odd .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 and 3",
    "we review the axial anomaly and the qcd vacuum structure respectively . in section 4",
    "we discuss in detail the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the consequences of this effect in heavy ion collisions . in section 6",
    "we define some observables and section 7 contains a discussion of our results .",
    "the derivation of the magnetic field is discussed in appendix  a. an alternative derivation of the chiral magnetic effect is given in appendix  b.",
    "in this section , we review some properties of topologically non - trivial gauge fields .",
    "we also review the relationship between topology and anomalous processes .",
    "all gauge field configurations which have finite action can be characterized by a topological invariant , the winding number @xmath0 .",
    "the winding number is an integer and given by @xmath28 here @xmath29 denotes the qcd coupling constant with generators normalized as @xmath30 .",
    "the gluonic field tensor and its dual are respectively @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "configurations with nonzero @xmath0 lead to non - conservation of axial currents even in the chiral limit . this can be seen from the axial ward - identity which reads @xmath33 here @xmath34 denotes the number of quark flavors , @xmath35 a quark field , and @xmath36 the mass of a quark .",
    "the axial current @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 we write @xmath39 to denote an average over fermionic fields only in the background of a particular gauge field configuration @xmath40 . to obtain the full expectation value",
    "@xmath41 one still has to perform the integration over the gluonic fields @xmath40 . in this article",
    "we will only consider the chiral limit , i.e.  @xmath42 .",
    "assuming that initially at @xmath43 we have an equal number of right - handed and left - handed fermions for the total number of right - handed fermions , which is the sum of the number of right - handed particles and right - handed antiparticles . here",
    "right - handed massless fermions have spin and momentum parallel , while left - handed massless fermions have spin and momentum antiparallel .",
    "the volume integral over @xmath44 however , is equal to the total number of right - handed particles minus the total number of left - handed antiparticles . ] , i.e.  @xmath45 , it follows from the axial ward identity that at @xmath46 @xmath47 this shows that configurations with positive @xmath0 convert right - handed fermions into left - handed ones .",
    "let us now write the number of right- or left - handed fermions of a particular flavor as @xmath48 .",
    "so @xmath49 . assuming that initially for each flavor separately @xmath50",
    ", one can show that @xmath51 @xmath52 where in this equation @xmath53 and @xmath54 can denote any quark flavor .",
    "this implies that in the chiral limit , the number of converted up and down quarks is equal .",
    "in the classical vacuum of qcd the gauge field has to be a pure gauge so that the energy density is minimal . in the temporal gauge ( @xmath55 ) this implies @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an element of the gauge group @xmath58 .",
    "the different classical vacua can be characterized by a topological invariant , the winding number @xmath59 which is an integer and given by @xmath60.\\ ] ] now one can show that if a gauge field configuration goes to a pure gauge at infinity and has nonzero @xmath0 it induces a transition from one classical vacuum to another , more precisely @xmath61    at zero temperature such transition requires tunneling through a potential barrier , which will suppress the transition rate exponentially . in this case",
    "the main contribution to the transition rate comes from fluctuations around instantons ( which are minima of the classical euclidean action ) .",
    "it was found by t hooft @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in qcd without fermions that the number of transitions @xmath62 with @xmath63 per unit volume and time equals @xmath64 here @xmath65 denotes the size of an instanton and @xmath66 the renormalized coupling constant .    at finite temperature the size of an instanton can not be larger than @xmath67 because of debye screening . because large instantons can not contribute to the transition rate at large @xmath68 anymore and @xmath69 goes to zero due to asymptotic freedom ,",
    "the transition rate due to instantons will go down if the temperature is raised .",
    "more specifically pisarski and yaffe @xcite computed the transition rate in the absence of fermions and found @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a function which behaves as @xmath72 for @xmath73 and as @xmath74 for @xmath75 @xcite .    hence for high temperatures the transition rate due to instantons becomes extremely small .",
    "this also happens in the electroweak theory where the coupling constant is always tiny . in this case transitions between different vacua",
    "lead to violation of baryon plus lepton ( @xmath2 ) number @xcite .",
    "however , it was realized that the electroweak theory contains static solutions which have finite energy and half integer winding number @xcite .",
    "such a solution with minimal energy is called a sphaleron ( ready to fall ) . if the temperature is higher than the energy of the sphaleron it is likely that one can go over the barrier instead of tunneling .",
    "this increases the transition rate and hence the rate for baryon number violation enormously @xcite .",
    "it was realized that these sphaleron configurations also exist in qcd @xcite .",
    "the typical energy of the sphalerons in qcd is @xmath76 .",
    "hence also in qcd at high temperatures one can go over the barrier which leads to an enormous increase in the transition rate . according to refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the rate for su(2 ) yang - mills theory is @xmath77 the rate has not been directly measured for qcd , but if we assume @xmath78 scaling , we estimate the rate for qcd to be @xmath79    there is a subtlety in these considerations for massless quarks . for massless quarks , the overlap between a state with zero chern - simons charge , and one with one unit of charge vanishes , @xmath80 since in the path integral representation for such a transition , the fermion determinant has a zero mode and vanishes .",
    "however , there is a non - zero contribution for @xmath81 since in the path integral representation for this quantity , the zero from the determinant is canceled by a singularity from the quark propagator which represents the operator @xmath82 .",
    "the overall expression is proportional to zero mode wavefunctions .",
    "this operator corresponds to a chirality flip , and as it should satisfies the anomaly relation between the change of helicity and the change of chern - simons charge .",
    "the total rate of transition is of course the sum of the rates of the lowering and raising transitions , @xmath83",
    "we will show in this section that gauge field configurations with nonzero @xmath0 can separate charge in the presence of a background ( electromagnetic ) magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "this we call the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "we consider the most ideal situation in which all quark masses vanish .",
    "this should be a good approximation in the deconfined , chiral symmetry restored phase .",
    "first we consider the case with a very large magnetic field , which means for us that @xmath84 is much larger than the momentum squared of all particles , i.e.  @xmath85 .",
    "then we will study the effect of a moderate field .",
    "initially we assume that we have a very small number of left and right - handed fermions .",
    "this is because our initial state has little fluctuation in the helicities of particles .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for an initial state typical of a color glass condensate , where the coupling is weak and the fluctuations should be generated by quantum mechanical tunneling , and therefore suppressed as @xmath86 @xcite . at later time , sphaleron  like transitions should be possible since the system becomes an ensemble of classical configurations with energy typically greater than the barrier @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic field is so large , all particles will be found in the lowest landau level .",
    "hence their spin is aligned along the magnetic field and they can also only move along the magnetic field .",
    "quarks with opposite charges have their spins aligned in different directions . if @xmath3 points in the @xmath87-direction positively charged right - handed fermions and negatively charged left - handed fermions will move in the positive @xmath87-direction ( upwards ) . at the same time",
    "positively charged left - handed fermions and negatively charged right - handed fermions will move downwards .",
    "we illustrated this situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargesep ] .    .",
    "assuming @xmath88 , this will convert a left - handed up / down quark into a right - handed up / down quark by reversing the direction of momentum .",
    "( 3 ) the right - handed up quarks will move upwards , the right - handed down quarks will move downwards . a charge difference of @xmath89",
    "will be created between two sides of a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    ", width=302 ]    the fermions will then interact with a gauge field configuration , so that some of them will change their helicity .",
    "after the interaction with the gauge field configuration has taken place we find that ( since we assumed the chiral limit ) @xmath90 so that if @xmath0 is nonzero we obtain a difference between the number of left and right - handed fermions that is the same for each flavor .",
    "the fermions can only change helicity by reversing their momenta , since spin flip is energetically suppressed in a large magnetic field ( we assumed @xmath85 ) .",
    "so after the interaction has taken place all positively charged right - handed fermions and negatively charged left - handed fermions will still move upwards . at the same time positively charged left - handed quarks and negatively charged right - handed quarks will still move downwards .",
    "however , now there is a difference between the number of right - handed and left - handed fermions . as a result",
    "an electromagnetic current is generated along the direction of @xmath3 .",
    "if we assume that initially all fermions are within a finite volume , this current will induce a charge difference @xmath91 between opposite sides a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath92 denotes the elementary charge and @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the charge in units of @xmath92 of a quark with flavor @xmath95 . for @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "the relation above becomes @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "an alternative derivation of this result is presented in appendix b.    since eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaq ] ) was obtained in the most ideal case , i.e. chiral limit and an extremely large magnetic field , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaq ] ) has to be an upper limit .",
    "therefore there is a maximum amount of charge that can be separated by a particular gauge field configuration in a homogeneous background magnetic field ; in other words @xmath100    in our derivation we ignored the back - reaction due to the electric field created by the separating charges .",
    "we believe that this back - reaction can only give rise to a small suppression of the effect .",
    "this is because the size of the electric field will be much smaller than @xmath101 since there are very few particles involved .",
    "moreover , in the physical case we are interested in , a heavy ion collision , the color forces will surely dominate .",
    "since the separation is independent of color , the mechanism will not create a net color charge difference .",
    "therefore we can safely ignore a gluonic back - reaction .      now that we considered the ideal situation with an extremely large magnetic field ,",
    "let us estimate the amount of charge separated in a moderate homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "there are now three important scales in the problem , @xmath101 , the temperature @xmath68 , and the size @xmath65 of the configuration with nonzero @xmath0 .    in a moderate magnetic field",
    "not all spins will be aligned along @xmath3 .",
    "let us introduce the function @xmath102 which denotes the degree of polarization along @xmath3 of quarks with flavor @xmath95 and energy smaller than @xmath103 .",
    "since a magnetic field does not distinguish between left and right - handed particles , @xmath102 will be the same for left and right - handed particles in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "moreover , ignoring chemical potential , @xmath102 will be equal for particles and antiparticles .    in a homogeneous magnetic field it is possible to calculate @xmath102 .",
    "the energy dispersion relation of a massless fermion is then given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the landau level .",
    "the @xmath106 level contains only one spin direction , all other levels contain both spin directions and are hence double degenerate .    the number density of quarks in a magnetic field with energy smaller than @xmath103 reads @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the degeneracy factor and @xmath109^{-1}$ ] is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the difference between the number density of fermions with spin parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field yields @xmath110 hence the degree of polarization of quarks / antiquarks with energy smaller than @xmath103 is given by @xmath111    let us try to find an approximation for @xmath102 . for @xmath112 , @xmath113 since only the lowest landau level contributes .",
    "for @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "therefore @xmath116 with @xmath117 we have computed eq .",
    "( [ eq : polar ] ) numerically and found that eq .",
    "( [ eq : betaf ] ) is a reasonable approximation .    at first hand , it might seem surprising that the temperature drops out the estimate for the degree of polarization .",
    "the reason for this is that we only considered the degree of polarization of a subset of all modes , namely the ones with energy smaller than @xmath103 . if one would instead be interested in the polarization of the bulk of the particles , one should take @xmath118 , by which the temperature dependence naturally is recovered .",
    "quarks with momenta much larger than the inverse size @xmath119 of the configuration with nonzero winding number will not be affected by these configurations and hence do not change helicity . therefore the quarks that change helicity will have momenta and hence energy smaller than @xmath120 .",
    "assuming that all quarks with energy smaller than @xmath119 are equally likely to change helicity we find the following estimate for the expectation value of the amount of charge separated @xmath121 where @xmath122 is essentially the flux through a configuration with nonzero @xmath0 .",
    "for small fields ( @xmath123 ) this reduces to @xmath124",
    "now that we know how much charge is separated by a single configuration with winding number @xmath0 , let us estimate the amount of charge separated in a heavy ion collision .",
    "we will assume that hot deconfined chirally restored matter is created , so our results of the previous section will be applicable .",
    "the two nuclei have radii @xmath125 , travel in opposite directions and collide with impact parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the plane @xmath126 is called the reaction plane .",
    "the angle @xmath127 is an azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the region in which the two nuclei overlap contains the participants , the regions in which they do not contain the spectators . ]    as we have shown in the previous section , if @xmath128 there is a good chance of getting charge separation . in a hot plasma ,",
    "the typical size of a configuration with nonzero @xmath0 is of the order of the magnetic screening length , @xmath129 .",
    "the typical required magnetic fields are therefore of order @xmath130 , which we estimate to be of order @xmath131 , for the initial conditions typical at rhic . in appendix",
    "[ app : magfield ] , we show that such enormous magnetic fields can indeed be created in off - central heavy ion collisions . in the plasma , the magnetic field is to a good degree homogeneous and pointing in a direction perpendicular to the reaction plane ( @xmath132 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : collision ] ) ) in the region of overlap of the colliding nuclei for the impact parameters of interest",
    ".    we will now define @xmath133 and @xmath134 to be the total positive / negative charge in units of @xmath92 above ( @xmath135 ) and below ( @xmath23 ) the reaction plane respectively .",
    "we have that @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the total positive / negative charge produced in a certain event .",
    "we define @xmath138 to be the difference between in charge on each side of the reaction plane @xmath139 .",
    "one generates an electric current along the magnetic field each time a transition from one vacuum to another is made .",
    "let us now imagine such transition happening in the center of the hot matter .",
    "locally a charge difference will be created due to the current .",
    "but since the quarks creating this current will still have many interactions before they leave the hot matter , presumably transitions in the center due to the final  state randomization of quark momenta will not give rise to any observable charge separation .",
    "now let us look to a transition near the surface of the hot matter .",
    "suppose that the situation is such that the charge separation mechanism causes more positively charged quarks to move outwards and more negatively charged quarks the move inwards ( the opposite situation is of course also possible with an equal probability ) .",
    "the positively charged quarks moving out of the surface will hadronize and can essentially freely propagate to the detector . on the other hand the negatively charged quarks will move inwards and still encounter many interactions . as a result",
    "the azimuthal angles of the positively and negatively charged quarks will become uncorrelated .",
    "this is very similar to the observed jet quenching in heavy ion collisions . only for very large impact parameters , when the size of the interacting region is about same as the scattering length , we expect correlations between positively and negatively charged particles to exist .",
    "each time a transition is made both @xmath140 and @xmath141 will change .",
    "the expectation value of the change is either positive or negative with equal probability and given by @xmath142 here we used that the most probable transitions are those which connect two neighboring vacua , so @xmath63 . the transitions which simultaneously induce changes with @xmath143 are suppressed ,",
    "therefore we have neglected them .",
    "we compute those transitions which are independent of one another , but taken over the time and volume of the system can induce multiple changes in the chern - simons charge . the functions @xmath144 are screening suppression functions in order to incorporate the effect that transitions near the surface are much more likely to contribute to @xmath145",

    "[ sec : mechanism ] that a homogeneous background magnetic field in the presence of a gauge field configuration with nonzero @xmath0 gives rise to a vector current @xmath343 along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "we take the background magnetic field to point in the @xmath87-direction so that only the following component is non - vanishing , @xmath344 initially , there is no difference between the number of left - handed and right - handed handed modes , therefore @xmath345 vanishes and there is no charge separation .",
    "clearly eq .",
    "( [ eq : j3 ] ) shows that if left- and right - handed modes are polarized in the same direction ( as it should in a large magnetic field ) , a charged current will only form if there is a difference between @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",
    "more explicitly in the limit of a very large magnetic field ( @xmath348 or @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the fermi momentum ) @xmath351 here @xmath352 denotes the charge of the particle and reflects the fact that particles with different charge are polarized oppositely in a magnetic field .",
    "we now immediately find that in the limit of large magnetic field the total current for a flavor @xmath95 is given by @xmath353      if we assume that all quarks were located within a finite volume , this electromagnetic current generates a charge difference @xmath355 between two sides of a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field of size @xmath356 this difference is the same as we found before in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaq ] ) .    in the same way we find the following baryon number difference @xmath357",
    "the baryon number difference vanishes for @xmath358 , while for @xmath359 , @xmath360 .",
    "since @xmath3 times the average charge of a baryon is smaller than @xmath355 , we expect the charge difference mainly to be realized in mesons , like @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in this appendix we considered a gauge field configuration with nonzero @xmath0 in the presence of a very large homogeneous magnetic field",
