    "we study theoretically the spectrum of resonance fluorescence and the spectrum at the cavity output of the light scattered by an atom , tightly confined inside an optical resonator and continuously driven by a laser .",
    "the photons collected at the detectors are scattered by the atom at the steady state of cavity - assisted cooling , and carry the information of the coupled dynamics between cavity and atomic external quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "we analyze the spectra in various cavity cooling regimes , which have been identified in  @xcite , applying and extending the method in  @xcite , used for evaluating the spectrum of resonance fluorescence of a laser cooled atom , to our case , in which the atom is strongly coupled to a mode of the quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "this work extends and complements previous theoretical investigations on the property of the light scattered by atoms inside resonators , see for instance  @xcite , by considering systematically the coupled dynamics between field and quantized atomic motion , which determines the steady state and the properties of the scattered light",
    ". differing from studies on the coupled dynamics of atoms in resonator , where both confinement and cooling are provided by the cavity field potential  @xcite , in this work the atom is confined by an external potential , like an ion or a dipole trap , and its motion is cooled by the mechanical effects of laser and cavity mode field .",

    "the atomic motion is confined by a tight harmonic potential and is kept cooled by the mechanical effects of cavity and laser fields .",

    "hence , in the far - field of the dipole source the electric field is proportional to the retarded value of the atomic dipole , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 dipole operator , and at the cavity output is proportional to the cavity field , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 annihilation operator of a photon of the cavity mode .",

    "correspondingly , the heating photons are mostly emitted by cavity decay and give rise to this signal .",
    "finally , we consider the spectra of emission when the atom is driven by a standing - wave laser with the trap center placed at one of its nodes , and the cavity parameters are such that the heating transitions are suppressed by destructive interference . in this configuration , the contributions to the spectra at zero order in the lamb dicke expansion defined in eqs .",
