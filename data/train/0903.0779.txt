    "in the limit that su(3 ) is an exact flavor symmetry it is possible to relate the magnetic moments of the baryon - octet and the @xmath0 transition to those of the proton and the neutron .",
    "these are the celebrated coleman - glashow formulas  @xcite .",
    "the improvement of this description requires the inclusion of a realistic su(3)-breaking mechanism . the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt )  @xcite is a proper framework to tackle this problem in a systematic fashion .    in the last decades",
    "several calculations of the su(3)-breaking corrections using @xmath1pt have been performed .",
    "it was soon realized that the leading chiral terms overestimate these corrections  @xcite .",
    "most of the calculations have been done in the context of heavy baryon ( hb ) @xmath1pt  @xcite , with  @xcite and without  @xcite the explicit inclusion of the decuplet resonances . in the hb approach",
    "it is necessary to work up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) to find a good agreement with data , although at the price of the predictiveness of the theory since at this level one has seven unknown low energy constants ( lecs ) to describe eight measured quantities .",
    "other approaches like cut - off regularized @xmath1pt  @xcite and large @xmath2 calculations have been considered  @xcite .",
    "the development of covariant @xmath1pt has been hampered by the problems in the power counting introduced by the baryon mass as a new large scale  @xcite .",
    "calculations of the baryon magnetic moments in the covariant approach have become available only after the advent of the infrared ( ir )  @xcite and the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms )  @xcite renormalization schemes . in",
    "the ir case  @xcite at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) the description is even worse than in the hb approach and it becomes necessary to reach nnlo .",
    "on the other hand , it has been found that within the eoms scheme up to nlo the agreement with the data is not only better than in hb and ir but also than the coleman - glashow description  @xcite . in the latter work the differences at nlo among the three different @xmath1pt approaches",
    "have been investigated , and the importance of analyticity has been highlighted .",
    "nevertheless , in su(3)-flavor @xmath1pt it is necessary to consider the contributions of the decuplet resonances since the typical scale for their onset @xmath3 gev is well below our expansion parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the description of higher - spin ( @xmath63/2 ) particles in a relativistic field theory is known to be problematic because of the presence of unphysical lower - spin components .",
    "for instance , in the rarita - schwinger ( rs ) formulation  @xcite adopted in this work , the field representation of a massive 3/2-particle is a vector - spinor @xmath7 with two unphysical spin-1/2 components in addition to the spin-3/2 component . in the presence of interactions",
    "the unphysical degrees of freedom are known to lead to pathologies like non - positive definite commutators or acausal propagation for the coupling of the photon  @xcite .",
    "equivalent problems in phenomenological hadronic interactions have also been largely discussed  @xcite . in the context of @xmath1pt one",
    "can use field redefinitions on the conventional chiral lagrangians in order to cast the interactions in a form that is invariant under the transformation @xmath8",
    "the resulting gauge symmetry ensures to keep active only the physical degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is abundant work concerning the inclusion of spin-3/2 resonances in the framework of baryonic effective field theories  @xcite .",
    "the baryon - decuplet consists of a su(3)-flavor multiplet of spin-3/2 resonances that we will represent with the rarita - schwinger field @xmath9 with the following associations : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the covariantized free lagrangian is @xmath20 with @xmath21 the decuplet - baryon mass and @xmath22 . in the last and",
    "following lagrangians we sum over any repeated su(3)-index denoted by latin characters @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the element of row @xmath25 and column @xmath26 of the matrix representation of @xmath27 .",
    "the conventional lowest - order chiral lagrangian for the interaction of the decuplet- and octet - baryons with the pseudoscalar mesons expanded up to one meson field is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 coupling , @xmath31 the meson - decay constant and @xmath32 is an off - shell parameter .",
    "an analysis of the constraint structure of the interacting theory of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rslag ] , [ eq : cnvlag ] ) yields @xmath33  @xcite . nevertheless , the resulting interaction leads to well - known problems afflicting the relativistic quantum field theory of 3/2-spinors  @xcite .    the alternative approach of demanding the effective lagrangians to be spin-3/2-gauge invariant leads , after a field redefinition , to the `` consistent '' @xmath30 interaction  @xcite @xmath34 which is on - shell equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cnvlag ] ) .",
    "besides , one obtains a second - order @xmath35 contact term @xmath36,(r^{\\mu\\nu}b)\\}\\rangle+\\langle \\bar{b}[[\\partial_\\mu\\phi,\\partial_\\nu\\phi],(r^{\\mu\\nu}b)]\\rangle-6\\langle\\bar{b}\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\partial_\\nu\\phi ( r^{\\mu\\nu}b)\\rangle\\right)\\label{eq : hoctlag}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the trace in flavor space .",
    "the latter lagrangian is interpreted as carrying the spin-1/2 content of the lagrangian ( [ eq : cnvlag ] ) .",
    "this term is eliminated by absorbing it into suitable higher - order lecs .",
    "we use the standard power counting where one assigns the chiral order @xmath39 to a diagram with @xmath40 loops , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) internal meson ( octet- and decuplet - baryon ) propagators and @xmath43 vertices from @xmath44th order lagrangians . in the covariant theory with the modified minimal subtraction method ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "this rule is violated by lower - order analytical pieces . in order to recover the power counting we apply the eoms renormalization prescription  @xcite . for the diagrams with internal decuplet - baryon lines we absorb into the lecs the terms breaking the power counting that are obtained expanding the loop - functions around the chiral limit .",
    "besides , the propagator corresponding to the rs action in @xmath46 dimensions @xmath47,\\ ] ] has a problematic high - energy behavior  @xcite . in the context of an effective field theory ,",
    "this is responsible for the appearance of @xmath46 - 4 singularities of a chiral order higher than the one naively expected using the power counting .",
    "these infinities would be absorbed by the proper counter - terms to be included at next orders .",
    "however , we do not include these terms explicitly but perform a @xmath45-subtraction on them and study the residual regularization - scale dependence .",
    "the @xmath30 coupling @xmath48 is obtained by fitting @xmath49 decay width  @xcite of the present work is different from the one often used in hb calculations  @xcite . in these papers , it is applied a convention for the `` vielbein '' that is related to ours by a factor of 2 .",
    "consequently , the values in the hb studies , @xmath501.5 , equal @xmath500.75 in our convention .",
    "notice also the corresponding differences in the coefficients in table [ table : coefficients ] . ] . in the su(3 )",
    "context , the value of @xmath29 can vary depending on the decay channel , with the one obtained from the @xmath49 decay being the largest  @xcite .",
    "this fact is effectively taken into account in our present study by using an average @xmath51 with @xmath52 mev",
    ". therefore , we use @xmath53 in our present study unless otherwise stated . for the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons we take @xmath54 gev , @xmath55 gev , @xmath56 gev while for the baryon masses we use the average among the members of the respective su(3)-multiplets , @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 gev .",
    "a moderate variation of @xmath59 and @xmath21 is investigated below .     and @xmath60 couplings respectively .",
    "diagrams * _ ( a)_*-*_(c ) _ * contribute at @xmath61 , while diagram * _ ( d ) _ * is a @xmath62-contribution that represents the difference between the calculation with consistent couplings and with conventional ones where @xmath33 ( see section iii).[fig : diagram ] ]",
    "the feynman diagrams with internal decuplet resonances that contribute to the baryon - octet anomalous magnetic moments at @xmath61 are those of fig . [",

    "their contribution is to be added to the ones coming from the su(3)-symmetric lecs @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and from the diagrams with internal octet - baryons  @xcite .",

    "the loop functions @xmath67 can be found in the appendix in terms of feynman - parameter integrals .",
    "the additional character that appears in the loop - functions of the diagram * _ ( c ) _ * indicates whether the seagull - diagram comes from the minimal substitution performed in the derivative of the meson fields ( @xmath68 ) or of decuplet fields ( @xmath69 ) in the consistent approach of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cnslag ] ) .    in order to recover the power counting we apply the eoms - scheme . after removing the @xmath60 ultraviolet divergences by the @xmath45 procedure ,",
    "this is equivalent to redefine the two lecs obtained in @xcite as @xmath70 where the functions @xmath71 can be found in the appendix .",
    "these functions , as well as the loop - functions , depend on the regularization - scale @xmath72 .",
    "we use a value @xmath73 gev and analyze below our results with respect to a moderate variation around this value . from the eoms - renormalized loop - functions @xmath74 one can then obtain the non - analytical pieces of the hb results assuming @xmath75 and applying that @xmath76 in what nowadays is known as the @xmath77-expansion  @xcite .",
    "one finds that at nlo the only non - zero contribution comes from diagram * _ ( a ) _ * , giving @xmath78 in agreement with the result of  @xcite . moreover , one obtains the decoupling of the decuplet resonances for the limit where @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , one finds that the eoms - renormalized loop - functions verify @xmath80 .",
    "we have also done the calculation using the conventional couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cnvlag ] ) with the choice @xmath33 .",
    "we found that the results of the seagull _ * ( c ) * _ of type @xmath68 are the same in both approaches , whereas the diagram _ * ( b ) * _ with conventional couplings equals the same diagram _ * ( b ) * _ minus the seagull _ * ( c ) * _ of type @xmath69 in the case of consistent couplings .",
    "the only difference between both calculations comes from diagram _ * ( a)*_. if we subtract the corresponding loop - function obtained using consistent couplings @xmath81 from the one obtained with the conventional couplings @xmath82 we find @xmath83 one can check that this is the contribution given by the tadpole fig [ fig : diagram]-_*(d ) * _ where the @xmath84 vertex is the one obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hoctlag ] ) .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ eq : hotadpole ] ) is the higher - order contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of the octet - baryons that is removed when using consistent couplings and interpreted as coming from unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the difference between both approaches comes from diagram _ * ( a ) * _ for which the consistent couplings eliminate completely the spurious spin-1/2 components . on the other hand ,",
    "both schemes include the non - consistent minimal @xmath85 coupling . in this regard",
