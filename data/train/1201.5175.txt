    "the chiral symmetry plays an important role in specifying some of the universality classes of the critical phenomena in disordered systems.@xcite systems are called chiral - symmetric when there exists an operator @xmath1 that anti - commutes with the hamiltonian , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 . with this symmetry",
    "the energy eigenvalues appear always in pairs @xmath5 , since if we have an eigenstate @xmath6 with an eigenvalue @xmath7 , the state @xmath8 is an eigenstate with an eigenvalue @xmath9 .",
    "the energy spectrum is therefore exactly particle - hole symmetric even when there exists a disorder as far as the disorder respects the chiral symmetry . in particular ,",
    "the zero - energy state can be expressed as an eigenstate of @xmath1 .    for a massless dirac fermions in two dimensions , usually with vertical and isotropic dirac cones as in graphene,@xcite the effective hamiltonian",
    "is expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the pauli matrix and @xmath12 denotes the dynamical momentum with the vector potential @xmath13 and the electron charge @xmath14 .",
    "the fermi velocity is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "for such a vertical dirac cone , we have obviously @xmath16 and thus the system is chiral - symmetric with @xmath17 . the zero - energy landau level ( zero modes ) , which is essential to the anomalous quantum hall effect for massless dirac fermions in a magnetic field , then becomes an eigenstate of @xmath18 .",
    "the most remarkable property with these zero modes is their robustness against disorder in gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "the zero energy ( @xmath0 ) landau level does not acquire any width due to such a disorder , while other landau levels are broadened as usual , and this gives rise to an unconventional criticality for the quantum hall transition at the @xmath0 landau level.@xcite this robustness of zero modes for a vertical dirac cone has been discussed in terms of the index theorem@xcite or based on the explicit form of wave functions due to aharonov and casher.@xcite it has been also demonstrated numerically that the chiral symmetry is also crucial to this robustness of zero modes of vertical dirac cones.@xcite    massless dirac fermions in two dimensions appear not only in graphene but also in certain organic metals , where we encounter pairs of tilted dirac cones.@xcite the existence of zero modes and the landau level structure have been established also for tilted dirac cones . however , the effect of disorder , in particular the robustness of zero modes and the role of symmetry , has not been explored until recently.@xcite in the present paper , with an explicit form of the eigenstates of the generalized chiral operator , we demonstrate how the chiral symmetry , which is broken for tilted cones , can be generalized to include tilted dirac cones and clarify its relevance to the robustness of the zero modes of generic massless dirac fermions .",
    "relationships between the generalized chiral symmetry and the applicability of the index theorem is also elaborated .",
    "to illustrate how the chiral symmetry is generalized to tilted dirac cones , let us consider a general form of the hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath19 for a two - dimensional massless dirac fermion in a magnetic field , where the isotropic dirac cone is tilted in the @xmath20 direction for @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the unit matrix .",
    "the dynamical momentum @xmath23 satisfies the commutation relation @xmath24 = -ie\\hbar b$ ] with @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 determines the tilting of the dirac cone .",
    "note that for @xmath27 an equienergy contour of the dirac cone is elliptic as long as @xmath28 ( while hyperbolic for @xmath29 ; see fig.[f1](a ) ) .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian destroys the chiral symmetry as @xmath30 .",
    "we can , however , define a generalized chiral operator @xmath31 as @xmath32 which arises naturally in the general framework of the eigenvalue problem for tilted dirac cones.@xcite although the generalized chiral operator @xmath31 is not hermitian ( @xmath33 ) , one can readily verify that @xmath34 with eigenvalues @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding right - eigenvectors @xmath36 are given explicitly as @xmath37 in the limit of the vertical cone ( @xmath38 ) , the generalized operator @xmath31 reduces to the conventional chiral operator @xmath39 .",
    "with the generalized chiral operator , we find that for @xmath40 , @xmath41 which we call the _ generalized chiral symmetry_.@xcite the generalized symmetry guarantees the identity @xmath42 , and plays an essential role for the robustness of zero modes as shown in the next section .",
    "note that this symmetry holds irrespective of the details of the vector potential @xmath13 .",
    "disorder in gauge degrees of freedom ( such as random magnetic fields ) respects this symmetry .",
    "if the above generalized chiral symmetry is preserved , the schrdinger equation @xmath43 for the wave function @xmath44 becomes @xmath45 the zero ( @xmath46 ) modes are then given by the wave functions satisfying@xcite @xmath47 or @xmath48 the zero modes are thus the eigenstates of the generalized chiral operator @xmath31 and have either ",
    "@xmath49 \" chirality with @xmath50 ( eq.([eq1 ] ) ) or ",
    "@xmath51 \" chirality with @xmath52 ( eq.([eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "it is to be recalled that for a vertical dirac cone the zero modes are also the eigenstates of the chiral operator @xmath53 .",
    "these equations for the zero modes hold even in the case where the gauge field is disordered .",
    "following aharonov and casher,@xcite we adopt the  coulomb gauge \" @xmath54 by assuming @xmath55 . then eq.([eq1 ] ) for @xmath56 and eq.([eq2 ] ) for @xmath57 are reduced to @xmath58\\psi^\\pm = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the solutios are then given by @xmath61 with a polynomial @xmath62 in @xmath63 . since @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 with @xmath67 , which leads to the asymptotic form @xmath68 in the limit as @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the total magnetic flux in the system .",
    "we then have to chose the chirality for the wave function to be normalizable .",
    "for instance , when the total magnetic flux @xmath70 is positive , the zero mode has to have",
    " @xmath49 \" chirality to be normalizable .",
    "the number of square - normalizable wave function then becomes @xmath71,@xcite that exactly coincides with the degeneracy of the landau level .",
    "this implies the zero - modes exhaust the landau level of a tilted dirac cone so that its density of states is a _ generalized chiral symmetry protected delta - function _ in the presence of disorder . in this sense ,",
    "the generalized chiral symmetry protects the zero mode of a generic massless dirac fermions in two dimensions .",
    "the above reasoning gives an explicit relationship between the index theorem and the generalized chiral symmetry .",
    "the index theorem , which gives the least number of zero modes , holds for an elliptic operator.@xcite in the present case , the hamiltonian @xmath72 is elliptic as a differential operator if the matrix , @xmath73 is invertible for any @xmath74 .",
    "the condition for the ellipticity thus becomes @xmath75 .",
    "this determinant is always negative ( @xmath76 ) and never becomes zero for @xmath74 , as long as @xmath28 .",
    "the condition @xmath28 is therefore exactly the condition for the ellipticity of the hamiltonian @xmath72 as well as that for the existence of the generalized chiral symmetry . in this sense , _",
    "the generalized chiral symmetry is generically equivalent to the ellipticity of the dirac - cone hamiltonian _ with the same parameter space for their validity .",
    "geometrically , the condition @xmath28 means that the dirac cone is not tilted too much so that the cross section with a constant energy plane remains to be elliptic .",
    "we have also preformed numerical calculations based on a lattice model having a pair of tilted dirac cones at @xmath46 as shown in fig.[f1](b)(inset ) .",
    "the model is defined on the two - dimensional square lattice with a hamiltonian having the nearest - neighbor @xmath77 and the next - nearest neighbor @xmath78 transfer integrals as @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the lattice point in units of the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath81 , and @xmath82 the unit vector in the @xmath83 direction .",
    "the magnetic field is taken into account by the peierls phases @xmath84 as @xmath85 , so that the their sum along the closed loop is equal to the enclosed magnetic flux in units of the flux quantum @xmath86 . to see how the landau levels are broadened by disorder in the present model , we assume that the magnetic flux @xmath87 enclosed by the square located at @xmath88 has a random component @xmath89 in addition to the uniform component @xmath90 .",
    "the random components have a gaussian distribution and are correlated in space as @xmath91 .",
    "the disorder in magnetic fluxes should appear , for large @xmath92 , as the disorder in gauge degrees of freedom , and therefore should respect the generalized chiral symmetry of the effective hamiltonian at the dirac points . as shown in fig.[f1](b ) , we actually see an anomalously sharp @xmath0 landau level when the correlation length @xmath92 of disorder becomes larger than the nearest - neighbor distance @xmath81 , while other landau levels ( @xmath93 ) are broadened as usual .",
    "together with the result@xcite for a different inclination of the cone , this anomaly at the @xmath0 landau level is likely to exist universally , irrespective of the magnitude of the tilting angle of the cone .",
    "this anomalously sharp @xmath0 landau level suggests that the energy levels are exactly degenerated at @xmath46 .",
    "the present numerical results are thus consistent with the robustness of zero modes of a single tilted dirac cone protected by the generalized chiral symmetry .    , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "we have shown explicitly that the notion of the chiral symmetry can be generalized to generic tilted dirac cones , where the generalized chiral operator has to be non - hermitian .",
