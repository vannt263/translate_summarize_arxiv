    "w. c. mccorkle ( director of u. s. army aviation and missile command ) have requested that i look at some of the physics of the emg . in the most recent request ,",
    "i was asked to look at stresses in a rotating cylinder . for the case of an elastic cylinder , this is a classic problem that is solved in many texts on linear elasticity  @xcite . however , when these derivations are examined closely , one finds certain shortcomings  @xcite .",
    "therefore , i spent some time looking at the problem of stresses in elastic rotating cylinders .",
    "that work resulted in a manuscript@xcite .",
    "in the course of this work  @xcite , i had to clearly understand the transformation properties of the largangian and eulerian strain tensors of finite deformation theory .",
    "i was quite dissatisfied with the standard derivations of the largangian and eulerian strain tensors because these derivations take either of two ( both unpalatable ) approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "shifter tensors are used , which are often defined as inner products between two basis vectors at _ two different spatial locations _  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "basis vectors are not parallel transported to the same spatial location before the inner product is carried out .",
    "this is unpalatable , even in euclidean space , unless one is using cartesian coordinates . in the second approach ,",
    "convected ( moving ) coordinates are used , and vectors and tensors are associated with a given _ coordinate _ in the convected ( moving ) coordinate system , rather than being associated with a point in the underlying space .    in the derivation that i present below ,",
    "i avoid both of the unpalatable features mentioned above .",
    "i provide a coordinate independent derivation of the lagrangian and eulerian strain tensors based on standard concepts in differential geometry : the parallel propagator , the world function , and the displacement vector field as a three - point tensor .",
    "the derivation that i present below is also useful for gaining a basic understanding of the role of the unstrained state , or reference configuration , in the definition of the strain tensors . having a firm conceptual grasp of",
    "the role of the unstrained state in the definition of the strain tensors is imperative for understanding the behaviour of pre - stressed materials under finite deformations in high - stress applications , such as , for example , in the electromagnetic rail gun  @xcite .",
    "the theory of stresses in rotating cylinders and disks is of great importance in practical applications such as rotating machinery , turbines and generators , and wherever large rotational speeds are used . in a previous work  @xcite",
    ", i gave a detailed treatment of stresses in a rotating elastic cylinder .",
    "this is a classic problem that is treated in many texts on linear elasticity theory  @xcite .",
    "these treatments linearize the strain tensor in gradient of the displacement field , assuming that these ( dimensionless ) gradients are small .",
    "i point out in ref  @xcite that for large angles of rotation the quadratic terms ( in displacement gradient in the definition of strain ) are as large as the linear terms , and consequently , these quadratic terms can not be dropped . in ref",
    "@xcite , i provide an alternative derivation of stresses in an elastic cylinder that relies on transforming the problem from an inertial frame ( where newton s second law is valid ) to the co - rotating frame of the cylinder  where the displacements gradients are small .",
    "during the course of that solution , i had to transform the lagrangian and eulerian strain tensors of finite elasticity to the ( non - inertial ) co - rotating frame of reference of the cylinder , which is a moving , accelerated frame .",
    "this work required the detailed understanding of the transformation properties of the lagrangian and eulerian strain tensors .",
    "the standard derivation of these strain tensors is done with the help of shifter tensors  @xcite .",
    "shifter tensors are often defined in terms of inner products of basis vectors that are located at two different spatial points  @xcite . for me ,",
    "inner products between vectors at two different points is an unpalatable operation , even in euclidean space . in order to compute the inner product between two vectors ,",
    "the vectors must first be parallel transported to the same spatial point ( unless we are using cartesian coordinates , in which case the derivation becomes coordinate specific ) .",
    "in other treatments , where shifter tensors are not employed in the derivation of strain tensors , convected ( moving ) coordinates are used , see for example  @xcite . when using convected ( moving ) coordinates , the coordinates of the initial undeformed point and the deformed point are the same , but the basis vectors change during deformation . in derivations of strain tensors",
    "using convected coordinates , vectors and tensors are associated with a given point in the convected ( moving ) coordinate system , rather than being associated with a point in the underlying ( inertial ) space .",
    "tensors are absolute geometric objects , and they should properly be associated with a point in the underlying space , and not a given coordinate , e.g. , in moving coordinates .    in this work ,",
    "i avoid the unpalatable features of the strain tensor derivation mentioned in the above two paragraphs .",
    "i derive the strain tensors using the concept of absolute tensors , where a tensor is associated with a point in the space  rather than the coordinates in a given ( moving ) coordinate system .",
    "i provide a coordinate independent derivation of the lagrangian and eulerian strain tensors , where i keep track of the positions of the basis vectors .",
    "the derivation necessarily uses two - point ( and three - point ) tensors  @xcite .",
    "the derivation is based on standard concepts in differential geometry : the parallel propagator ( a two - point tensor ) , the world function ( a two - point scalar ) , and the displacement vector field ( a three - point tensor ) .",
    "this derivation makes clear the transformation properties of the strain tensors under coordinate transformations from one frame of reference to a second frame that is moving and accelerated ( with respect to the first frame ) .",
    "the derivation below of the eulerian and lagrangian strain tensors makes the transformation properties ( e.g. , to a moving frame ) clear .",
    "furthermore , this derivation makes the role of the reference ( unstrained ) configuration more clear in the definition of the strain tensors .",
    "clarifying this role is of importance for applying finite deformation theory to pre - stresssed materials , which are capable of withstanding higher - stress applications , such as in rotating machinery  @xcite .",
    "finally , the derivation presented here allows the generalization of the definition of strain tensors to the realm where general relativity applies  @xcite .",
    "in euclidean space , a vector can be trivially parallel propagated in the sense that after a round trip the vector still points in the same direction . in riemannian space , the parallel displaced vector is not equal to itself after the round trip parallel displacement . in this sense , in euclidean space we need not distinguish the position of a vector because  it always points in the same direction under parallel displacement \" even though its components may be different from point to point because the basis vectors , onto which we project the vector , point in a different direction from point to point .",
    "so , in euclidean space the parallel displaced ( physical ) vector ( a geometric object ) is thought to point in the same physical direction . in riemannian space , however , the situation is quite different . in riemannian space , when a vector is parallel displaced it will in general point in a different direction .",
    "the physical test is to parallel displace the vector along a curve that returns to the starting point .",
    "if there is non - zero curvature , as measured by the riemann curvature tensor , then upon returning to its starting point the vector components will be different than the initial vector components at the starting point .",
    "so , in reimannian space , it is imperative to specify the position of a vector . in euclidean space , appropriate to material deformations , i also keep track of the position of a vector .",
    "this additional care in euclidean space , together with the transformation properties of the world function , leads to a clearer understanding of the transformation properties of the lagrangean and eulerian strain tensors , under transformations from one system of coordinates to another that is in relative motion ( a moving frame ) .    in this section",
    "i briefly review the fundamental geometric quantities that naturally arise in discussion of deformation , but which are not usually discussed in this context .",
    "these quantities are the world function ( or fundamental two - point scalar of the the space ) , the parallel propagator , and the position vector .",
    "this section will also serve to define my notation .",
    "each of the quantities mentioned are examples of a class of geometric object objects known as two - point tensors , which occur naturally in the discussion of deformations .",
    "i have found useful discussions of general tensor calculus in synge and schild  @xcite and synge  @xcite , and discussions oriented toward deformation theory in the appendix by ericksen in treusdell and toupin  @xcite , and in narasimhan  @xcite , eringen  @xcite , and eringen  @xcite . in particular , discussion of two - point tensors can be found in synge  @xcite , ericksen  @xcite , narasimhan  @xcite and eringen  @xcite .",
