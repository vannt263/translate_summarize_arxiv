    "the ubiquity of normal diffusion can be understood by the central limit theorem which , roughly speaking , states that an appropriately scaled sum of many independent identically distributed random variables with finite variance converges in distribution to a normally distributed random variable .",
    "hence , the erratic motion of a grain of pollen suspended in water , as observed by the botanist brown in 1827 , can be understood as the relatively heavy grain experiencing the sum of many uncorrelated kicks of the chaotic much lighter water molecules .",
    "it has become evident that brownian motion and its associated normal diffusion is too simplistic to describe the variety of diffusion processes in complex systems .",
    "there are many situations where the central limit theorem fails @xcite , and their fluctuations are of the so called lvy type rather than of the gaussian type . whereas gaussian processes are continuous processes with finite variance , lvy processes ( or @xmath0-stable processes ) exhibit jumps of all sizes and have infinite variance . + distilling the information relevant to anomalous diffusion from a time series is a scientific challenge .",
    "distinguishing between normal and anomalous diffusion usually involves the analysis of the mean - square displacement which grows linearly for normal diffusion and sub - linearly or super - linearly for anomalous sub- and super - diffusion , respectively .",
    "we show numerically that estimating the asymptotic growth rate of the mean - square displacement is not an efficient method for distinguishing anomalous from normal diffusion ; in finite - size time series the statistical behaviour of rare large jumps is not resolved .",
    "we therefore suggest to use lower - order moments of order @xmath2 where the many well - resolved small jumps contribute more than rare large jumps .",
    "+ in addition it is well known that the estimation of asymptotic growth rates often suffers from a bias caused by a non - zero mean of the observables , and requires error prone pre - processing of the data to subtract the mean or the employment of detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite .",
    "we propose a new method where an eventual non - zero mean is inherently removed by calculating the @xmath3th moments not of the process directly but by rotating the process with a deterministic periodic driver .",
    "+ a different approach to detect anomalous diffusion is to employ the @xmath1-variation which recently found lots of application in successfully detecting anomalous behaviour in time series @xcite . in the case of additive noise , however , this method has been shown to lead to inconclusive results as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we compare our method with the standard method of estimating the asymptotic growth rate of the @xmath3th moment as well as with the method of @xmath1-variation for uncontaminated data and for data contaminated by biased additive measurement noise .",
