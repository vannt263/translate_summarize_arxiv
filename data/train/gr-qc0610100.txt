    "in recent years there has been a revived interest in theories having a larger number of spatial dimensions than the three that are observed .",
    "in contrast to the original kaluza - klein theories of extra dimensions , the recent development of extra dimensional theories allow the extra dimensions to be large and even infinite in size ( in the original kaluza - klein theories the extra dimensions were curled up or compactified to the experimentally unobservable small size of the planck length : @xmath0 cm ) .",
    "these new extra dimensional theories have opened up new avenues to explaining some of the open questions in particle physics ( the hierarchy problem , nature of the electro - weak symmetry breaking , explanation of the family structure ) and astrophysics ( the nature of dark matter , the nature of dark energy ) .",
    "in addition they predict new experimentally measurable phenomena in high precision gravity experiments , particle accelerators , and in astronomical observations .",
    "we consider 5d gravity + two interacting fields @xcite .",
    "the key for the existence of a regular solution here is that the scalar fields potential have to have _ local _ and _ global _ minima , and at infinity the scalar fields tend to a local but _ not _ to global minimum .",

    "the potential @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant which can be considered as a 5d cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
