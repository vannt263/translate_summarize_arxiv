    "the existence of these scaling laws has been used to establish that present - day etgs did not form by several dry mergers of lower mass progenitors _ obeying the same scaling laws _ , because as an effect of dry mergers the galaxy size increases rapidly with mass , while the velocity dispersion remains almost constant , in contrast with the observed correlations  ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , although dry merging works qualitatively in the right direction , it is not clear whether it works quantitatively .    in this letter",
    "we address the question of the viability of dry merging as a process driving the structural evolution of etgs , by testing whether it is able to produce the local scaling laws with their relatively small intrinsic scatters .",
    "for this purpose , we use the set of numerical simulations of dissipationless minor and major mergers presented in ntb09 and test them against the stellar - mass scaling relations of the sloan lenses acs survey ( slacs ) sample of lens etgs @xcite .",
    "this strategy allows us to construct a direct link between the observed properties of high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) galaxies  for which estimates of the stellar masses are available  and realistic simulated galaxies , in which the relative distribution of luminous and dark matter has been calibrated on the lensing - mass scaling relations ( ntb09 ) .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , which is consistent with the gravitational lensing constraints for slacs etgs @xcite .",
    "observational data are converted to this calibration when necessary .",
    "the main results of this paper do not depend on this choice , since they involve stellar - mass ratios and the imf normalization effectively factors out .",
    "in the present work we consider the stellar - mass  size , stellar - mass  velocity - dispersion and stellar - mass fp relations derived by @xcite for the slacs sample of lens etgs , assuming salpeter imf stellar masses and using the velocity dispersions and rest - frame v - band half - light radii derived from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopy and hubble space telescope photometry .",
    "the correlations are obtained using galaxies with stellar masses generally in the range @xmath14 .",
    "the stellar - mass  size relationship is given by @xmath15 with intrinsic scatter in @xmath16 at fixed mass 0.071 .",
    "the stellar - mass  velocity - dispersion relation is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the projected velocity dispersion within an aperture radius @xmath19 .",
    "this has an intrinsic scatter in @xmath20 at fixed mass of 0.055 .",
    "finally we consider the fp - like correlation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a dimensionless structure parameter .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in @xmath23 at fixed @xmath9 is 0.077 .",
    "we recall that slacs lenses are indistinguishable from control samples of sdss galaxies with the same stellar velocity dispersion and size , in terms of luminosity and distribution of environments @xcite .",
    "in addition , as discussed in @xcite , the above scaling relations are consistent with other scaling relations derived for larger samples of sdss galaxies with a similar range of masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : in particular the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath9-@xmath6 relation is consistent with the observed scatter of the widely used correlation found by @xcite .",
    "here we combine the scaling laws described above , observations of high-@xmath3 etgs and the results of the n - body simulations presented in ntb09 to address the question of whether dry mergers can be responsible for the observed size evolution of etgs .",
    "the set of simulations ( see ntb09 for details ) consists of both major and minor dry - merger hierarchies , i.e. sequences of two or three steps in each of which the galaxy mass increases by a factor of @xmath24 as a consequence of either a binary equal - mass merger or the accretion of @xmath25 smaller satellites .",
    "the seed galaxies and the satellites are spherical , with @xcite dark - matter distribution , @xcite stellar distribution ( with central logarithmic slope @xmath26 ) , and no gas .",
    "altogether we consider eight major - merger hierarchies ( differing in the orbital energy and angular momentum of the galaxy encounters , and in the stellar mass fraction @xmath27 of the seed galaxies ) and four minor - merger hierarchies ( differing in @xmath27 , @xmath25 and in the phase - space distribution of the satellites centers of mass ) .",
    "each galaxy collision is followed up to the virialization of the merger remnant . in the second and third steps of the hierarchies",
    "the remnants of the previous steps are used to realize the initial conditions .",
    "the seed galaxies ( and consequently all the end - products of each merging hierarchy ) can be rescaled by fixing arbitrarily the simulation mass and length scales @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see ntb09 ) . though the relative effect of dry mergers on the galaxy structure and kinematics is independent of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , it is useful to fix these quantities , without loss of generality , to make the comparison with observations straightforward . for our purpose ,",
    "it is natural to consider seed galaxies with stellar masses and sizes similar to those of high-@xmath3 etgs .",
    "here we take as reference the sample of nine @xmath30 etgs studied by vd08 , having median stellar mass @xmath31 ( assuming salpeter imf ; * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : sm ] the points with @xmath48 show the location of the merger remnants of all steps of the hierarchies in the @xmath9-@xmath44 , @xmath9-@xmath6 and @xmath9-@xmath18 planes .",
    "for the adopted values of the length and mass scales , the timescale to complete one step of the merging hierarchies is in the range @xmath49 gyr , so all hierarchies can be comfortably completed in the @xmath50 gyr elapsing from @xmath51 to the present .",
    "the location of the merger remnants with respect to the local scaling laws is quite dependent on the details of their merging history , but it is apparent that all the merger remnants lie significantly below the @xmath52 relation and above the @xmath53 relation . on average ,",
    "minor mergers increase more the galaxy size than major mergers , consistent with the results of @xcite , but we also find that different minor - merging events produce remnants with significantly different @xmath6 and @xmath18 for similar @xmath9 , even when the initial conditions differ just by the relative phase - space distribution of the centres of mass of the satellites and the central galaxy ( see the right - most pairs of stars in fig .  [",
    "fig : sm ] ) .",
    "the behavior of our minor - merger hierarchies in the @xmath9-@xmath18 plane deserves some discussion .",
    "when a galaxy grows by accreting satellites on almost parabolic orbits ( as is the case for our minor - merger steps ; see ntb09 ) , the virial velocity dispersion of the remnant is lower than that of the progenitor _ if the mass loss is negligible _ @xcite . the fact that in some of our minor - merger steps the remnant has slightly higher projected ( and virial ) velocity dispersion than the progenitor must be ascribed to the significant loss of luminous ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] ) and dark ( see ntb09 ) matter , which is known to have the effect of increasing the velocity dispersion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in general the merger remnants lie close to the fp - like relation @xmath9-@xmath44 , consistent with previous studies considering the fp @xcite or the lensing mass plane ( ntb09 ) .",
    "an exception is the minor - merging hierarchy with @xmath39 seed galaxy ( crosses in the diagrams ) , in which @xmath44 increases significantly with stellar mass , reflecting the relatively low @xmath9 and high @xmath18 due to substantial mass loss .",
    "altogether , considering both major and minor merger hierarchies , our results confirm that dry mergers bring compact etgs closer to the observed correlations .",
    "however , quantitatively , the process is not efficient enough to explain the observed size evolution .",
    "we note that the final merger remnants ( the end - products of the last steps of the hierarchies ) have exceptionally high stellar masses ( @xmath54 ) , so one can not invoke more growth via dry mergers to obtain systems with surface mass density as low as observed in local galaxies .",
    "furthermore , velocity dispersion is approximately conserved along the merger hierarchies , and objects with @xmath55 are not observed in the local universe .",
    "taken at face value , the stellar masses and sizes of the high-@xmath3 etgs mean that these systems can not evolve into present - day etgs via dry mergers . however , possible observational biases in the high-@xmath3 measurements ( for instance , that the sizes are underestimated ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could make the discrepancy between high and low redshift systems smaller .",
    "thus , if one only considers _ average _ properties , dry mergers may perhaps be still considered a viable evolutionary mechanism . however , recovering the average size of local etgs is not sufficient : additional constraints come from the small _ intrinsic scatter _ of observed stellar - mass scaling relations , which constrains the dry - merger mass assembly history of present - day etgs , _ independently of the actual compactness of their high-@xmath3 counterparts_. a first attempt of constraining the merging history of etgs using the scatter in the stellar - mass  size relation was performed by @xcite , who  on the basis of an analytic parametrization of the size growth due to dry mergers  found that a certain degree of fine tuning in the orbital parameters of the galaxy encounters is required in order to reproduce the local @xmath9-@xmath6 relation of their sdss sample of etgs .",
    "we take here a step further , by taking advantage of n - body merger simulations and up - to - date stellar - mass scaling laws , including information on stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we quantify the growth of galaxies by dry merging by approximating the dependence of the structural parameters on stellar mass with power - law functions ( see ntb09 for the lensing - mass analogs ) : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "to each step of a hierarchy we associate a value of @xmath59 by calculating @xmath60 , where @xmath61 indicates variation between the remnant and the progenitor .",
    "the resulting 30 values of @xmath59 are distributed with average @xmath62 and standard deviation @xmath63 .",
    "doing the same for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we get @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 . assuming that the galaxy merging history is characterized by slopes @xmath70 normally distributed with these averages and standard deviations",
    ", we can use these quantities to describe how dry mergers move galaxies in the planes @xmath9-@xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath9-@xmath6 and @xmath9-@xmath18 : the relatively large values of @xmath71 we find mean that dry mergers introduce substantial scatter in these planes .    for the dry - merging scenario to be viable",
    "it must not introduce in the scaling relations more scatter than observed .",
    "we can use this condition to constrain the properties of the candidate progenitors of local etgs , assuming as working hypothesis that they formed by dry merging .",
    "let us consider , for example , local etgs with given stellar mass @xmath72 in the range @xmath73 probed by the slacs sample : in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatt ] the distributions ( within 1-@xmath74 ) of @xmath44 , @xmath6 and @xmath18 for these galaxies are represented by the vertical bars , while the loci in the @xmath9-@xmath44 , @xmath9-@xmath6 and @xmath9-@xmath18 planes of their allowed dry - merging progenitors are shown by the shaded areas .",
    "galaxies lying out of these areas , growing by major or minor dry mering , would populate regions of the parameter space inconsistent with the local observed distributions at the reference mass @xmath72 .",
    "it is apparent that the strongest constraint comes from the @xmath9-@xmath6 plane ( central panel ) , where the allowed region for progenitors spans @xmath75 dex in @xmath9 .",
    "this means that a growth in stellar mass by dry merging by more than a factor of @xmath76 ( and in size by more than a factor of @xmath77 ) is excluded on the basis of our set of simulations . in other words ,",
    "present - day massive ( @xmath78 ) etgs can not have assembled , on average , more than @xmath79 of their stellar mass through dry merging .",
    "quantitatively , the constraints on the mass assembly history depend on the specific choice of the orbital parameters and mass ratios of the galaxies : in our set of merging hierarchy simulations there are more major than minor mergers , and we explore a wide range of orbital parameters .",
    "one might get different numbers by considering more minor - merging simulations or excluding parts of the orbital parameter space .",
    "for instance , if we consider only the 8 minor merger steps , we get @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which gives an upper limit of @xmath82 to the fraction of stellar mass assembled via dry mergers by local etgs . in any case",
    ", it is clear that _ a remarkable degree of fine tuning is required to reproduce the tightness of the local scaling relations with dry mergers_.",
    "dry merging makes galaxies less compact . for this reason",
    "it has been proposed to be the key to reconcile the compactness of high-@xmath3 etgs with the lower stellar - mass surface - density of local etgs .",
    "our quantitative analysis based on n - body simulations shows that _ it is very hard to reproduce with dry mergers the growth in size of a factor of @xmath83 _ between @xmath0 and today reported in the literature for @xmath84 etgs , because the average size growth produced by dry merging is not sufficient .",
    "the tightness of the local scaling laws of etgs provides an additional and stringent constraint for the dry - merging scenario .",
    "as we have shown , generic dry mergers tend to increase the scatter rather than decrease it because they can not preserve simultaneously the correlations between stellar mass , velocity dispersion and effective radius .",
    "on the basis of our set of major and minor merging simulations , we conclude that  independent of the actual compactness of higher-@xmath3 etgs _ typical present - day massive etgs did not assemble more than @xmath4 of their stellar mass and grew more than a factor @xmath77 in size via dry merging_. a similar upper limit is found also for the total ( dark plus luminous ) mass assembly on the basis of the lensing - mass scaling laws ( ntb09 ) .",
    "is this then the end of dry mergers as a major evolutionary mechanism ?",
    "the only way out could be provided by a high degree of fine tuning of the mix of progenitors and orbits .",
    "although not a natural scenario in our opinion , this fine tuning could perhaps reproduce such tight scaling relations and thus save the day .",
    "a systematic exploration of cosmologically motivated merging hierarchies is necessary to find out whether such an extreme fine tuning actually occurs .",
    "the question of what drives the apparent size evolution of etgs remains open .",
    "a possibility is that a combination of different astrophysical processes and observational biases can do the job ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is not excluded that the answer is to be found exploring more exotic scenarios , such as those assuming non - standard dark matter @xcite .",
