    "in the era of precision cosmology represented by the first - year wmap data ( bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) among others , the scientific goals of studies on galaxy clusters are gradually shifting from the exploration of cosmology to investigations of cluster physics itself . for cosmological uses , clusters of galaxies are often assumed to be idealized spherical and homogeneous systems .",
    "recent x - ray observations by chandra and xmm - newton , however , have revealed complex structures in a number of clusters , whose origins are still to be clarified ( e.g. markevitch et al . 2000 , 2002 ; peterson et al .",
    "2003 ; fabian et al .",
    "there has hence been an increasing need for accurate and reliable measurements of clusters at multi - wavelengths to further pursue studies on cluster physics .",
    "the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect ( sze ) , the inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background by hot electrons , serves as yet another diagnosis of the intracluster medium ( sunyaev , zeldovich 1970 , 1972 ; for reviews see rephaeli 1995 ; birkinshaw 1999 ; carlstrom et al .",
    "the intensity of the thermal sze is proportional to the line - of - sight integral of the electron density times the temperature , @xmath1 , whereas that of the x - ray thermal bremsstrahlung emission is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the combination of the two thus yields independent measures of the density and temperature distributions , including the departure from spherical symmetry ( zaroubi et al .",
    "1998 ; hughes , birkinshaw 1998 ; yoshikawa , suto 1999 ; donahue , et al .",
    "in addition , it is still not easy to explore the nature of very hot ( @xmath3  kev ) gas with x - ray facilities alone , as the energy band of x - ray spectrometers with sub - arcminute spatial resolution is currently limited to below 10  kev .",
    "the sze has an advantage in resolving such hot gas even in distant clusters , given its linear dependence on @xmath4 and its redshift independence ( e.g. rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "this is of particular importance in depicting violent activities in clusters , such as mergers and associated heating of the gas .    as of today ,",
    "the spatial resolution of the majority of the sze imaging observations is limited to arcminute scales , considerably lower than current x - ray observations ( @xmath5 for xmm - newton , @xmath6 for chandra ) .",
    "this is largely due to the limited number of radio telescopes with sub - arcminute resolution in the range of wavelengths relevant to the sze measurements . controlling the systematics of such large telescopes to the sensitivity level required for the sze imaging is also challenging .",
    "interferometers are stable with carefully controlled systematics and have allowed high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) imaging of the sze ( e.g. , jones et al . 1993 ; carlstrom et al .",
    "1996 ) ; the effective resolution ranges from @xmath7 to a few arcmin , with more s / n at the largest angular scales .",
    "a single - dish telescope with an array of detectors working at millimeter or submillimeter wavelengths is also a promising tool of the sze imaging observations .",
    "it is highly plausible that an array with hundreds to thousands of bolometers , such as bolocam ( glenn et al . 2003 ) and scuba-2 ( holland et al . 2003 ) , will achieve an angular resolution of @xmath8 while retaining a wide field - of - view of @xmath9 .",
    "given the recent progress and numerous on - going plans of the sze surveys , it is likely that future cluster data , especially at high redshifts , will be dominated by the sze images and supplemented by the x - ray and optical follow - up observations .",
    "therefore , we explore uses of the sze data beyond the standard analysis done so far .",
    "an ideal and unique template for this purpose is provided by rx  j13471145 at redshift @xmath0 , the most x - ray - luminous cluster of galaxies known ( schindler et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "this cluster is an exceptional target of high - resolution sze observations for two reasons : 1 ) the central sze intensity , characterized by the central @xmath10-parameter of @xmath11 , is more than twice as large as any other clusters observed to date , and 2 ) its compact size , characterized by an angular core radius of @xmath12 , enables mapping within a relatively narrow field - of - view of existing facilities .",
    "a number of measurements have thus been carried out for this cluster ( komatsu et al . 1999 , 2001 ; pointecouteau et al . 1999 , 2001 ; reese et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we currently have sze maps of rx  j13471145 at three bands : an sze _ increment _ map at 350  ghz with a spatial resolution of @xmath7 ( komatsu et al .",
    "1999 ) , and _ decrement _ maps at 150  ghz and 21  ghz with the resolutions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ( komatsu et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , our 150  ghz observation has achieved the highest resolution of the sze images so far and revealed a complex substructure with enhanced decrement signals at @xmath15 off the x - ray center .",
    "the substructure was not visible in the previous rosat x - ray image ( schindler et al .",
    "1997 ) , indicating that it has a very high temperature that is far beyond the energy band of the rosat / hri ( @xmath16  kev ) .",
    "this finding was subsequently confirmed by the chandra observations with an emission - weighted temperature toward the substructure of @xmath17  kev , much higher than the ambient temperature @xmath18  kev ( allen et al . 2002 ) . based on their keck spectroscopy of 47 member galaxies ,",
    "cohen and kneib ( 2002 ) suggested that this cluster is undergoing a major merger .",
    "indeed , this is a good demonstration that the sze imaging observations provide an independent and powerful diagnosis of cluster physics .    in this paper",
    ", we combine our multi - band , high - resolution sze images and the chandra x - ray data of rx  j13471145 to present a proto - type analysis that will continue to prove useful in the future .",
    "more specifically , we take into account radial temperature profile and non - sphericity of the intracluster gas to constrain the gas distribution and the cluster bulk motion",
    ". we also attempt to deproject temperature profile of the cluster on the basis of the sze and x - ray surface brightness , without a knowledge of spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "finally , we explore the physical nature of the high - temperature substructure and discuss its implications on the merger history and dynamical activities of the cluster .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a standard set of cosmological parameters : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) . in this cosmology ,",
    "an angular size of 1@xmath22 corresponds to a physical size of 5.74 kpc at the cluster redshift @xmath0 . unless stated otherwise ,",

    "we describe below the observations and the data used in the present paper .",
    "the summary of the sze data is presented in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "our submillimeter mapping observations at 350  ghz were performed with the sub - millimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) ( holland et al . 1999 ) , attached on the nasmyth platform of the james - clark - maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) in hawaii .",
    "there are 37 and 91 bolometers at 350 and 650  ghz , respectively .",
    "the observations were carried out in 1998 and 1999 .",
    "the first year data are published in komatsu et al .",
    "the radial profile of the first year data clearly indicated an extended positive signal consistent with the sze increment feature , and the fitted amplitude of the sze matches the prediction of the x - ray data . while the azimuthally averaged radial profile had a reasonable s / n , the noise per each pixel of the map was too high to study the detailed morphology of the sze , owing to poor weather .",
    "a typical zenith optical depth during the first year was @xmath28 , which corresponds to the `` wet '' condition at jcmt .",
    "the 1-@xmath23 noise level averaged over the first year map was 8.0  mjy  beam@xmath27 .    in order to improve on",
    "the s / n of the map , we performed additional observations on 1999 july 3 and 4 .",
    "the weather condition of the second year was much better than that of the first year mentioned above . a typical zenith optical depth was @xmath29 on july 3 and @xmath30 on july 4 .",
    "the 1-@xmath23 noise level averaged over the second year map is 6.4  mjy  beam@xmath27 , and that of the coadded map ( shown in figure [ fig : szmaps ] ) is 5.3  mjy  beam@xmath27 .",
    "we used the planet uranus for the primary flux calibration and beam measurements .",
    "we also observed the planet mars as a secondary flux calibrator , and checked the stability of the gain of the telescope .",
    "there was no significant gain variation during the observations ; thus , the calibration error is dominated by the uncertainty in the flux of uranus , which is less than 15% .",
    "the beam pattern was fitted by an elliptical gaussian profile with axis sizes @xmath31 . for simplicity , however , we approximate the beam as a symmetric gaussian whose size is the geometric mean of the elliptical fit , @xmath32 .",
    "since the beam - size of the first year map was @xmath33 , we use @xmath7 as the effective fwhm beam - size of the coadded map .",
    "this approximation of the beam does not cause significant systematic errors compared to the instrumental noise level in the coadded map .    in both years",
    ", sky chopping was done in the azimuth direction with a length of @xmath34 .",
    "the observations were made in the `` jiggle '' mode , where each bolometer samples 64 independent points on the sky separated by @xmath35 .",
    "we have reduced the time - ordered data with the reduction tools in the surf package ( jenness , lightfoot 1998 ) , following the standard data analysis pipeline .",
    "after deswiching , flat - fielding , extinction corrections , and the sky noise correction with remsky ( jenness et al .",
    "1998 ) , we have removed the spikes above 4-@xmath23 in the time - ordered data using despike .",
    "the map - making routine , rebin , allocates the reduced time - ordered data onto a rectangular grid with a gaussian low - pass filtering .",
    "we choose @xmath5 as a nominal pixel size in the final map , because it is close to the nyquist sampling at 350  ghz ; thus , each pixel in the map is treated as being independent .",
    "the non - uniformity of noise in the map is taken into account explicitly .",
    "measurements of the sze are in general difficult with scuba , except for very compact clusters , such as rx  j13471145 . since the sze signal is typically extended across the field - of - view ( @xmath36 in diameter ) , a fraction of it will be lost by sky chopping . in the standard data analysis pipeline",
    ", remsky subtracts the average of some ( if not all ) selected bolometers from each bolometer upon each integration , further reducing the atmospheric noise as well as the sze signal .",
    "zemcov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) proposed a way to partially resolve this problem ; instead of subtracting the average flux , they subtract the signal correlated with that at 650  ghz upon each integration .",
    "their method removes less sze and is suitable for extended clusters , because the contribution of the sze to the total flux is much smaller at 650  ghz than 350  ghz .",
    "it is , however , reported to increase noise by 15% compared to remsky .",
    "considering both the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods , we adopted the standard pipeline mentioned above to yield a map with a better s / n for this particular cluster .",
    "the nobeyama bolometer array ( noba , kuno et al . 1993 ) , mounted on the nobeyama 45-m telescope in japan , consists of 7 bolometers . since the data we present here are exactly the same as those published in komatsu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we outline our millimeter observations at 150  ghz only briefly , with particular emphasis on differences between the data reduction procedures of noba and scuba .",
    "a notable difference between noba and scuba is that noba does not require chopping .",
    "the bolometers are read - out through six differential circuits between the central bolometer and the other six surrounding ones ; the outputs are differential signals between the central bolometer and each of the six surrounding bolometers .",
    "the atmospheric noise is thus subtracted electronically rather than mechanically . in the map - making algorithm ,",
    "the six differential outputs are used to reconstruct signals at the central bolometer .",
    "by rotating the array clockwise by @xmath37 , a scan path yields seven equally - spaced lines with the separation of @xmath38 , which determines the size of a pixel .",
    "we have performed two orthogonal raster scans ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 scans ) , each being @xmath41 wide and consisting of three parallel scans .",
    "the baseline level varies from one scan to the other due to the atmospheric noise ( the scanning effect ) .",
    "the scanning effect can be reduced by combining the two orthogonal raster scans .",
    "we use the so - called plait method ( emerson , grve 1988 ) , which reduces the scanning effect in fourier space by suppressing the low - frequency modes that are aligned with the scan direction .",
    "the final map has the fwhm beam - size of @xmath13 , the 1-@xmath23 noise level of 1.6  mjy  @xmath42 , and the field - of - view of @xmath43 .",
    "( 146mm,146mm)fig1a.eps ( 146mm,146mm)fig1b.eps      in addition to the high - resolution observations mentioned above , we also performed mapping observations at 21  ghz using the dual circular polarization hemt amplifier mounted on the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "details of the observations and the data are presented in komatsu et al .",
    "the map has the fwhm beam - size of @xmath14 , 1-@xmath23 noise level of 0.9  mjy  @xmath44 , and field - of - view of @xmath45 .",
    "the capability of this telescope for sze observations has also been demonstrated for several other clusters at 21 , 36 , and 43  ghz ( tsuboi et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ; pointecouteau et al . 2002 ) .",
    "radio sources can be serious contamination against measurements of the sze ( e.g. , cooray et al . 1998 ) . in our analysis",
    ", we excise pixels that are potentially contaminated by radio sources .",
    "there are in total three sources in our observing field ; one known radio source , one newly - discovered submillimeter source , and one candidate source .",
    "we briefly describe their properties below .    at the center of our target cluster , there is a known radio source whose flux has been measured at several frequencies ( komatsu et al . 1999 , 2001 ;",
    "pointecouteau et al .",
    "this source is the central cd galaxy , and the optical spectroscopy implies that it hosts an agn with a very strong oii emission line ( schindler et al .",
    "1995 ; cohen , kneib 2002 ) .",
    "the spectrum in radio bands continues to decline with frequency , implying synchrotron emission from the agn .",

    "( komatsu et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a power - law extrapolation of the lower frequency measurements implies @xmath47 mjy and @xmath48 mjy at 150  ghz and 350  ghz , respectively .    we have also found a bright submillimeter source in our scuba image ( figure [ fig : szmaps ] ) , located at @xmath49 southwest from the cluster center . the flux at 350  ghz is @xmath50 mjy .",
    "the existence of the source has been confirmed by our vla follow - up observations at 8.46  ghz .",
    "this newly - discovered submillimeter source merits further investigation , and the results will be reported elsewhere ( i.  tanaka et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the secondary cd galaxy located at @xmath51 east of the cluster center ( schindler et al .",
    "1995 ) may also contaminate our 350  ghz image .",
    "the optical spectroscopy implies that this source is a red elliptical galaxy with no oii emission line , and has a comparable @xmath52-band luminosity to the central cd ( schindler et al .",
    "1995 ; cohen , kneib 2002 ) .",
    "no radio counterpart has been detected between 1.4  ghz and 150  ghz , suggesting that this source does not host an agn . in our 350  ghz image ,",
    "an enhanced emission is indicated around the position of the secondary cd .",
    "this emission may originate from dust in the source and it needs to be confirmed by infrared observations . though this source is not responsible for all of the extended emission seen in the map , it may distort the image . to be conservative",
    ", we exclude the pixels around this galaxy in our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : szmaps ] shows high - resolution sze increment and decrement images we obtained at 350  ghz and 150  ghz , respectively .",
    "both images are centered at @xmath53 ( j2000 ) . for display purposes ,",
    "they are smoothed by a gaussian filter with an fwhm of @xmath7 , while the intensities are still given per beam - sizes listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",

    "the rms levels measured on these _ smoothed _ images are 3.0 mjy  beam@xmath27 and 0.7 mjy  beam@xmath27 at 350  ghz and 150  ghz , respectively .",
    "the contributions of the three sources described in subsection [ sec : sources ] are explicitly shown .",
    "the zero level is defined by the average intensity at the map edge .",
    "overlaid are the contours of 0.57.0 kev x - ray surface brightness taken by chandra .    as first discovered by komatsu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the sze decrement at 150  ghz shows a clear enhancement at @xmath15 southeast from the x - ray center of this cluster .",
    "the significance of the southeast peak in the 150  ghz image is at the 4.2-@xmath23 level , strongly indicating that there is a substructure in this region .",
    "the position of the peak is in good agreement with that of the enhanced x - ray emission found by chandra ( allen et al .",
    "the increment image at 350  ghz also shows a similar extended feature in the southeast region , while a higher noise level and possible contamination from the secondary cd make it harder to identify the excess emission by eye .",
    "although the s / n of the present data is not sufficient for a detailed pixel - to - pixel confrontation , a quantitative comparison is still possible by means of azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles .",
    "we divide the 350  ghz and 150  ghz maps into four quadrants as in figure 2 of komatsu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : southeast ( se ) , southwest ( sw ) , northeast ( ne ) and northwest ( nw ) .",
    "figure [ fig : quad ] displays radial profiles in these quadrants after excluding the pixels within a radius of 10@xmath22 from the three radio sources described in subsection [ sec : sources ] .",

    "ghz deviates from the data in the other directions at the 2.5-@xmath23 level .",
    "this may partly be due to a reference ( negative ) signal of the 15  mjy source in the sw region as a result of the @xmath34 chopping , yet it should diminish below the current noise level by a sky rotation .",

    "we first fit the 0.57.0 kev spectrum of the cluster average component between radii @xmath59 and @xmath60 with the mekal thin - thermal plasma model ( mewe et al .",
    "1985 , 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ; liedahl et al . 1995 ) to obtain @xmath163  kev , a value consistent with that reported in allen et al .",
    "we then fit the spectrum of the se quadrant of the same radii with a two - component mekal model , incorporating both the cluster average with 12.6  kev ( fixed ) and the excess .",

    "though weak , the derived limit on the temperature of the latter component , @xmath164 kev at the 90% confidence level , is fully consistent with equation ( [ eq : te ] ) .",
    "the presence of very high temperature gas in excess of 20  kev inferred in section [ sec : se ] supports strongly an idea that the cluster has undergone a recent subcluster merger ( cohen , kneib 2002 ; allen et al .",
    "we explore the properties of this region based on a simple one - dimensional shock model as follows .",
    "we assume that the pre - shock gas has the density @xmath165 and the temperature @xmath166 kev expected for the cluster average component .",

    "hugoniot conditions across the shock with an adiabatic index @xmath169 , we find that the mach number of the pre - shock gas is @xmath170 , and the velocity of the pre - shock and post - shock gas relative to the shock front are @xmath171  km  s@xmath27 and @xmath172  km  s@xmath27 , respectively . for a head - on collision of equal mass clumps ,",
    "the collision velocity is @xmath173  km  s@xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding density ratio @xmath174 implies @xmath175 @xmath142 . assuming further that the pre - shock gas distribution is described by equations ( [ eq : betamodel])([eq : beta ] ) with @xmath176 , the distance of the subclump from the cluster center , including the line - of - sight displacement ,",
    "is suggested as @xmath177 or 230  kpc .",
    "previous hydrodynamical simulations of takizawa ( 1999 ) , for instance , showed that the gas temperature can rise up to @xmath178 kev as a result of a head - on collision of @xmath179  m@xmath65 clusters with relative velocity @xmath180 km s@xmath27 .",
    "the highest temperature gas is likely to emerge near the bounce - shock with total gas mass of @xmath181  m@xmath65 for a duration of @xmath182  gyr ( m.  takizawa , private communication ) .",
    "gravitational softening length of 20  kpc and the gas particle mass of @xmath183 m@xmath65 used in the simulations are sufficient for resolving the substructures comparable to that found in rx  j13471145 .",
    "though it is still premature to conclude the origin of the hot gas in rx  j13471145 , these results are consistent with our interpretation of shock heating during a violent merger .",
    "a merger event may also produce high - energy nonthermal particles . while bepposax observations of rx  j13471145 ( ettori et al .",
    "2001 ) have found little evidence for their contribution to the entire x - ray emission of this cluster , nonthermal particles may affect the enhanced sze and x - ray signals locally .",
    "we examined the chandra spectrum of the se excess position ( @xmath184 ) , and found that the effective photon index is 1.4 without subtracting the cluster average component .",
    "this is comparable to , or even harder than , those expected from the inverse compton and nonthermal bremsstrahlung emissions , 1.5 and 2.0 , respectively , in the strong shock limit ( sarazin 1999 ; sarazin , kempner 2000 ) .",
    "thus , if the nonthermal component is included in the spectral analysis , the inferred thermal temperature would become higher , unless the spectrum is fully dominated by the inverse compton emission resulting from the strong shock .",
    "a harder nonthermal electron spectrum may be possible as a result , for instance , of coulomb losses , but they will also lead to unacceptably large heating of the thermal gas ( petrosian 2001 ; takizawa 2002 ) .",
    "contribution of nonthermal electrons to the sze signals depends sensitively on the amount and spectrum of relatively low energy nonthermal electrons ( e.g. , ensslin , kaiser 2000 ; colafrancesco et al .",
    "2003 ) , but is unlikely to dominate over the thermal sze ( shimon , rephaeli 2002 ) . in any case , if the nonthermal component is separated from the thermal and kinematic sze in future observations , it will provide a useful probe of the nature of high - energy populations in clusters .    in the present analysis , we excluded the regions around already resolved contaminating sources .",
    "one further possibility of contamination , particularly in the 350  ghz image , is unresolved emission from background submillimeter sources ( smail et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "if such sources are distributed rather uniformly in the cluster field , their average contribution has been subtracted in our analysis , as we only used the signal relative to the map edge .",
    "shot - noise - like signals , on the other hand , may increase the noise level of the image , but are unlikely to produce the extended feature illustrated in figure [ fig : quad ] .",
    "the gravitational lensing effect tends to enhance the emission close to the critical lines , not toward the cluster center .",
    "we thus conclude that the contribution of the background sources is unlikely to change the main results of this paper .",
    "another possibility of contamination is dust emission inside the cluster .",
    "edge et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report detection of such emission in two out of seven central galaxies in clusters .",
    "dust may also be present in the intracluster medium ( dwek et al .",
    "1990 ; stickel et al .",
    "2002 ) , although such diffuse dust is likely to be destroyed via sputtering within the age of the universe ( draine , salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "since dust emission from the cluster member galaxies or the intracluster medium will peak at far - infrared wavelengths , it can be constrained directly by infrared facilities , such as sirtf and astro - f .",
    "we will investigate these points in detail elsewhere ( k.  yamada , t.  kitayama , in preparation ) .",
    "it will also be interesting to see if the secondary cd really contains dust , as implied by our scuba map .",
    "we have performed combined analyses of the highest resolution sze and x - ray images currently available for rx  j13471145 .",
    "the data at both 150  ghz and 350  ghz show clear signatures of enhanced sze signals at @xmath185  kpc southeast from the center of this cluster .",
    "we have separately determined the temperature , density , and the line - of - sight extent of this excess component , after removing the foreground and background signals .",
    "the presence of high - temperature gas with @xmath186  kev strongly indicates that the cluster has recently experienced a major merger .    excluding the regions around the southeast enhancement and the radio sources",
    ", the sze signals at 350 , 150 , and 21  ghz agree well with those expected from the electron density and temperature profiles of chandra x - ray observations .",
    "our multi - band sze data indicate marginal evidence for the line - of - sight elongation of the gas distribution or non - zero peculiar velocity .",
    "the central @xmath10-parameter extrapolated from radii greater than @xmath187  kpc is @xmath188 .",
    "we further present a temperature deprojection technique using the sze and x - ray imaging data .",
