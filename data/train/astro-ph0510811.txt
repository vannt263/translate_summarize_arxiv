    "instead , the shock - drift acceleration process , involving a single transmission of upstream cosmic ray particles through the shock ( webb , axford , & terasawa 1983 ; drury 1983 ) shapes the particle spectrum in superluminal shocks . as a result , the distribution of accelerated particles downstream of the shock is the upstream particle distribution compressed and shifted to higher energies . because of particle angular distribution anisotropy , the mean energy gain of particles transmitted through",

    "the study showed that the particle spectra generally diverge from a simple power law ; the exact shape of the spectrum depends on both the amplitude and the wave power spectrum of the magnetic field perturbations .",
    "we reported and discussed such features as spectrum hardening before the cutoff at high particle energies in oblique subluminal shocks , and the steepening of the spectrum and the cutoff formation in the resonance energy range in superluminal shocks . in the latter case , the role of the long - wave magnetic field perturbations proved to be critical for the generation of the power - law spectral tails .",

    "these particles are used in a given simulation run and have the same initial weights @xmath74 .      in the previous paper we developed a hybrid approach for modeling the motion of high - energy particles in the turbulent field including short mhd waves .",
    "it involves the exact integration of particle orbits in the perturbed field including long and resonance waves only , and the short - wave ( @xmath83 ) influence on the trajectory is reproduced with a small - amplitude pitch - angle scattering term .",
    "a need for such approach arose due to excessive computation time required to derive exact trajectories in the magnetic field with short - wave perturbations .",
    "this limitation becomes less severe for ultrarelativistic shock acceleration studies because for the high-@xmath1 shocks both upstream and downstream residence times are shorter than in the case of the previously investigated mildly relativistic shocks , and for a particle of a given energy these times decrease with @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in the present paper we _ do not _ use the hybrid approach , and calculate particle orbits directly by integrating their equations of motion in the considered perturbed magnetic field near the shock .    in the computations we use the runge - kutta 5-th order method with the adaptive step size control ( routine rkqs in : press et al .",

    "we checked by numerical tests , that the computed particle orbits are stable over more than the mean upstream and downstream residence time and the derived trajectories are reversible in time over their entire path .",
    "this proves that the numerical noise is maintained at the very low level , which is independently demonstrated by the accompanied diffusion coefficients derivations ( see appendix ) .",
    "in the present work we use monte carlo simulations to study the role of the realistic magnetic field features on the first - order fermi acceleration processes at ultrarelativistic shocks in the test particle approach . as pointed out by @xcite , most ( essentially all ) magnetic field configurations in the case of ultrarelativistic shocks lead to superluminal conditions for the acceleration process .",

    "then , only a small fraction of these particles is further accelerated in the first - order fermi process forming an energetic tail in the energy spectrum . the tail shape and its extension to high energies strongly depend on the magnetic field turbulence spectrum .",

    "the shock moves in the downstream plasma rest frame with velocity @xmath98 and the cross - field diffusion must approach its upper limit  the bohm diffusion efficiency  in order to allow a sufficient fraction of downstream particles to remain continuously active in the energization process .",
    "this can be achieved in a relatively easy way by applying simplified turbulence modeling similar to those proposed in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , where by selecting specific parameters for small - amplitude particle pitch - angle scattering one allows for conditions with nearly isotropic particle diffusion , or the modeling of @xcite , where upstream sinusoidal field perturbations are selected from the narrow , approximately resonance wavevector range at all particle energies .",
    "studies involving finite wavevector range turbulence spectra , like the ones considered in @xcite and in the present paper , show a substantial difficulty in generating the downstream field perturbations that allow for efficient cross - field diffusion .",

    "they form finite intermittent volumes near the shock with varying magnetic field obliquities , including the subluminal ones , where the acceleration process can proceed more easily and in some cases particle reflections from the shock can occur ( see @xcite for the discussion of these effects in mildly relativistic shocks ) . however , for the in - average - perpendicular field configuration such subluminal regions are advected with the plasma flow and replaced by successive regions with possibly superluminal conditions , thus removing ( advecting downstream ) accelerated particles from the shock .",

    "[ wobl1]_a _ ) and highly perturbed conditions ( @xmath100 or 3.0 upstream of the shock ) the amplitudes of resonant magnetic field perturbations are small upstream , and nonlinear downstream of the shock . however , the downstream compressed turbulence is strongly anisotropic , with most power in the magnetic field components parallel to the shock front , which results in decreased particle diffusion efficiency along the shock normal ( see appendix ) .",
    "these downstream conditions are essentially independent of the initial particle energy , and the particle spectra for @xmath101 = @xmath102 , 1 and 10 , and for @xmath103 in fig .",

    "[ wobl1]_b _ ) , the physical situation is substantially modified . here",
    "the acceleration process after particle injection proceeds through the `` superadiabatic '' shock compression phase , followed by the energetic spectral tail formation at the ensemble of shock conditions involving different local magnetic field inclinations , due to high amplitude of the long waves .",

    "an additional factor responsible for the observed changes of @xmath108 is a weaker particle scattering upstream of the shock for growing @xmath112 , due to the shorter particle residence time before recrossing the shock downstream .",

    "the results for the kolmogorov turbulence and for @xmath113 ( _ dashed line _ ) and @xmath95 show the effects of the increasing shock lorentz factor on the angular distributions at the shock .",

    "this character of the acceleration processes at ultrarelativistic parallel shocks deviates from that predicted by numerical simulations using the small - angle scattering approximation for modeling of the perturbed magnetic field structure at the shock @xcite and confirmed by ( semi)analytic approaches @xcite , as well as numerical models using other approaches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all these studies indicate formation of the power - law particle spectrum with the asymptotic ( @xmath115 ) spectral index @xmath116 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , these acceleration models do not consider the effects of realistic turbulence at the shock , and in particular the significant role played by the long - wave perturbations .",
    "the different character of the acceleration processes at parallel shocks obtained in the present approach is an effect of the downstream magnetic field compression discussed above for oblique superluminal shocks . in the case of large - amplitude perturbations",
    ", the compression of tangential magnetic field components leads to the formation of an effectively perpendicular shock configuration .",
    "in such conditions , the efficiency of particle acceleration critically depends on the ability of particles to diffuse across field lines of the compressed turbulence .",
    "however , as the results for superluminal shocks show , the anisotropic diffusion involved is relatively inefficient for the compressed highly perturbed fields and the final particle spectra become very steep ( see the results for @xmath117 and @xmath118 in figure [ wpar1 ] and @xmath119 and @xmath120 in figure [ wpar2 ] ) .",
    "note also , that features analogous to the ones observed in superluminal shocks  dependence of the particle distribution on the shock lorentz factor , variation of the spectral slope in the case of the kolmogorov turbulence  appear in the spectra for the parallel shocks . as in @xcite , particle spectra calculated for the considered small perturbation amplitudes are non - power - law ones in the full energy range , and the spectral index of the power - law part of the spectrum",
    "depends on the wave power spectrum of the magnetic field turbulence .",
    "the deviations of the spectra from the power - law character are due to a limited dynamic range of the field perturbations . because of",
    "the lack of long - wave perturbations for high - energy particles with @xmath121 , locally oblique field configurations can not be formed and particles can be only transmitted downstream of the shock and escape . and",
    "@xmath122 for @xmath113 and @xmath123 , and for the flat and kolmogorov turbulence , respectively , and @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) , because simulations of high - energy spectral tails require excessive run times . therefore , the extension of the spectral cutoffs to high energies was not reliably studied for these few cases . ]    the angular distributions for parallel shocks with @xmath113 are presented in figure [ angd2 ] . for mildly perturbed ( @xmath100 ) magnetic fields ( @xmath57  _ squares _ and @xmath56  _ stars _ ) , one can see the features observed in the angular distributions for oblique superluminal shocks ( fig .",
    "[ angd1 ] ) .",
    "the differences in the distributions for small - amplitude perturbations ( @xmath127 ) reflect the difference in the spectral indices for power - law parts of the particle spectra for the flat ( _ dashed line _ ) and kolmogorov ( _ solid line _ ) turbulence .",
    "the results presented here for the first - order fermi acceleration modeling at ultrarelativistic shock waves reveal several unknown earlier features of such processes .",
    "the most important finding of this work is that the generated particle spectra substantially depend on the form of the magnetic turbulence near the shock  contrary to the widely distributed opinion in the present literature .",
    "simulations show a significant role of the perturbed magnetic field compression at the shock , which leads to highly anisotropic particle diffusion conditions in the approximately 2d turbulence formed downstream of the shock . in the case of the flat turbulence spectrum , the continuity of the magnetic field lines across the shock , and a limited particle diffusion along the shock normal in the downstream region result in the formation of very steep spectral tails with cutoffs within the resonance energy range considered .",
    "the spectra derived for the kolmogorov turbulence show , that the existence of high - amplitude long - wave magnetic field perturbations can substantially modify the acceleration process , allowing for the formation of more extended and flatter spectral components at superluminal shocks , as well as very flat components at parallel shock waves .",
    "however , also in this case the spectrum steepening begins and/or the energy cutoff occurs a few orders of magnitude below the maximum particle energy corresponding to the resonance condition for the longest waves upstream of the shock . the simulations also show that for the same background conditions the shock waves with larger lorentz factors produce steeper spectra with lower cutoff energies .    the compressed magnetic field turbulence structure downstream of the shock is expected to relax with time to the lower - energy isotropic 3d distribution .",
    "this may involve various plasma heating and cosmic ray acceleration processes , discussion of which is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "we note , however , that the characteristic time scale for such the isotropization at the given wavelength @xmath128 can be estimated as @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is the alfvn velocity in the downstream medium ) , so that the relaxation processes can not completely remove the considered anisotropy at the gyration time scale for particles with @xmath131 .",
    "thus , such particles are always influenced downstream of the shock by the respective resonance and long - wave _ anisotropic _ structure .    in the following paper ( niemiec & ostrowski , in preparation )",
    "we will present a further extension of the present model by including into consideration a highly nonlinear short - wave turbulent component , analogous the one formed at the shock due to plasma instabilities discussed in the literature ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "our present results for ultrarelativistic shock waves , as well as the results obtained for mildly relativistic shocks @xcite , require revision of many earlier discussions of cosmic - ray acceleration up to very high energies at relativistic shock waves .",
    "the results show , that turbulent conditions near the shock which are consistent with the shock jump conditions can lead to substantial modifications of the acceleration picture with respect to the simplified models producing the wide - range power - law energy distributions , often with the  asymptotic \" or `` universal '' spectral index . with the turbulent magnetic field structures analyzed here , the generation of ultra ",
    "high - energy cosmic rays at ultrarelativistic shocks is ineffective .",
    "the role of the first - order fermi process on the observational properties of astrophysical sources hosting relativistic shock waves requires serious reanalysis .",
    "recently we have become aware of the work by @xcite , who modified the approach of @xcite to discuss particle acceleration at high-@xmath1 shocks with the downstream magnetic field structure obtained from the shock jump conditions .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical method used in both papers does not take into account the correlations between upstream and downstream trajectories at particle shock crossings , which are introduced by the field structure .",
    "this is caused by the separate statistical averaging of the particle transport properties upstream and downstream , and the subsequent treatment of these distributions as independent .",
    "therefore , the method can not properly reproduce the resulting correlations in particle energy gains , return probabilities , and the respective propagation times at successive shock crossings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their effect on the final particle spectra .",
    "the approach is thus unable , or only partially able , to reproduce the results obtained with more realistic background conditions discussed in @xcite and in the present paper .",
    "we are grateful to martin pohl for useful discussions of the results and for providing valuable comments and suggestions on the manuscript .",
    "we also thank david carter - lewis for carefully reading the manuscript .",
    "the present work was supported by the polish state committee for scientific research in 2002 - 2005 as a research project pbz - kbn-054/p03/2001 , and by mnii in 2005 - 2008 as a research project 1 p03d 003 29 .",
    "in our simulations the magnetic field structure downstream of the shock becomes effectively two - dimensional , perpendicular to the shock normal .",
    "due to the inefficient particle cross - field diffusion , advection of particles with the general downstream flow leads to high particle escape rates resulting in steep particle spectra .    to better understand propagation conditions in this region",
    ", we derived particle diffusion coefficients @xmath132 along the three axes in the downstream plasma rest frame , following the method described in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the modeling shows a highly anisotropic diffusion downstream of the shock , with the coefficient along the shock normal @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "for the example considered in fig .",
    "[ dyff ] of the shock wave with @xmath95 , propagating in the magnetic field with the mean field inclination @xmath135 and the flat wave power spectrum of the ( upstream ) amplitude @xmath117 , the downstream diffusion coefficients for particles of energy @xmath136 are @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the difference between @xmath139 and @xmath134 comes from the contribution of the mean field component which lies in the @xmath27 plane ( @xmath140 in this case ) .",
    "the exact values of the diffusion coefficients depend on particle energy .",
    "one should note , however , that the diffusion coefficient values derived here can serve only as a general characterization of the propagation properties downstream of the shock .",
    "they represent particle motion on time scales much larger than the particle gyration time scale , the latter being important in the modeling of the relativistic shock acceleration .",
