    "the large - scale structure of the universe is a complex interconnecting pattern whose structural elements comprise filaments , sheets and clusters of galaxies surrounding large voids . according to standard theories this `` cosmic web '' develops by a process of gravitational instability from small initial fluctuations in the density of a largely homogeneous early universe .",
    "the physical description of an inhomogeneous universe revolves around the dimensionless density contrast , @xmath1 , which is obtained from the spatially - varying matter density @xmath2 via @xmath3 / \\rho_0 $ ] where @xmath4 is the global mean density .",
    "it is useful to expand the density contrast in fourier series , in which @xmath5 is treated as a superposition of plane waves : @xmath6 the fourier transform @xmath7 is complex and therefore possesses both amplitude @xmath8 and phase @xmath9 where @xmath10 the real and imaginary parts are @xmath11 and @xmath12 so that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we also have @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in theories of structure formation involving cosmic inflation @xcite , the initial fluctuations that seeded the structure formation process form a gaussian random field @xcite possessing the properties of statistical homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "in such fields the real and imaginary parts of @xmath7 are independent gaussians so that the modulus @xmath17 has a rayleigh distribution and the phases @xmath9 are uniformly random on the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "obviously the distribution of @xmath5 in position space will also be gaussian ; indeed all finite - dimensional joint probabilities of @xmath5 in different locations are multivariate gaussian in this case @xcite .",
    "even if the primordial density fluctuations were indeed gaussian , the later stages of gravitational clustering must induce some form of non - linearity .",
    "one particular way of looking at this issue is to study the behavior of fourier modes of the cosmological density field .",
    "if the hypothesis of primordial gaussianity is correct then these modes began with random spatial phases . in the early stages of evolution ,",
    "the plane - wave components of the density evolve independently like linear waves on the surface of deep water . as the structures grow in mass",
    ", they interact with other in non - linear ways , more like waves breaking in shallow water .",
    "these mode - mode interactions lead to the generation of coupled phases .",
    "while the fourier phases of a gaussian field contain no information ( they are random ) , non - linearity generates non - random phases that contain much information about the spatial pattern of the fluctuations but which is ignored entirely in the usual clustering descriptors , such as the power spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to gain quantitative insight into the behavior of phases in gravitational systems .",
    "some studies @xcite have concentrated on the evolution of phase shifts for individual modes using perturbation theory and numerical simulations .",
    "an alternative approach was adopted by @xcite , who developed a practical method for measuring the phase coupling in random fields that could be applied to real data .",
    "more recent studies have established connections between phase evolution , clustering dynamics and morphology @xcite and new methods have been developed for visualizing phase information @xcite .",
    "connections have also been demonstrated @xcite between phase information and alternative measures of non - linear clustering such as the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "one of the major barriers to the more widespread use of phase - based methods for probing cosmic nonlinearity is the lack of any well - established statistical framework for quantifying the information contained in the fourier phases . since phases are angular variables traditional statistical measures of location and dispersion are inappropriate .",
    "moreover , probability distributions for circular variables have very different properties to those for variables defined on the real line ; see the monographs by @xcite and @xcite for more detailed discussion .",
    "the upshot of this is that it is not yet known whether there are useful standard distributions and limit theorems like those that make the gaussian distribution so useful and so ubiquitous for statistical analysis .",
    "it is this deficiency we address in this letter .",
    "non - linear clustering is difficult to handle rigorously with analytic methods .",
    "our approach is therefore to develop an approximate theory and test it using numerical experiments .",
    "the simulations we shall be comparing to theory are constructed within a finite cubic volume with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the fourier representation of the clustering pattern they reveal is therefore discrete . in particular phases",
    "are defined for wave - vectors on a cubic lattice which , for simplicity , we take to have an integer spacing . in previous analyses of phase coupling phenomena",
    "@xcite it has been found useful to introduce a quantity @xmath19 , defined by @xmath20 which measures the difference in phase of modes with neighboring wave - numbers in one dimension .",
    "this has many advantages as a descriptor , not the least of which is that a translation of the origin by @xmath21 which alters each @xmath9 by @xmath22 only produces a constant offset in @xmath19 .",
    "one can analyze a three - dimensional simulation by extracting a vector @xmath23 from differences in three orthogonal @xmath24-space directions ; the result contains information about both the location and structure of features in @xmath25 space .",
    "one can think of @xmath19 as a discrete representation of @xmath26 , the phase gradient .",
    "note that if the two angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent and uniformly random then the difference @xmath29 is also uniformly random , so that @xmath19 will be uniformly distributed for gaussian fields .    when fluctuations are small @xmath30 they evolve linearly : the initial statistics are preserved in this regime because each mode evolves independently . when @xmath31 , however , mode - coupling terms alter the distributions of both amplitudes and phases . strictly speaking , therefore ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the fourier representation of @xmath5 in this regime are no longer gaussian .",
    "however the form of the fourier expansion ( [ eq : ft ] ) itself guarantees that , as long as the autocorrelations of @xmath5 do not have too large a spatial extent , the fourier superposition will be approximately gaussian .",
    "it is therefore still a reasonable approximation to take @xmath11 and @xmath12 to be gaussian even for non - linear systems @xcite . more important for our purposes",
    "is the fact that , while for gaussian fields each @xmath24-mode is statistically independent , a non - linear field contains mode - mode correlations @xcite .",
    "these induce phase correlations which manifest themselves in departures from uniformity of the distribution of @xmath19 .    we can model the effect by assuming that the two neighboring modes involved in ( [ eq : d ] ) have real and imaginary parts that are gaussian distributed . for notational",
    "ease we suppress the label @xmath32 and so the real parts of each are written @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the imaginary parts @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we assume these can be approximated as gaussians but we allow them to be cross - correlated .",
    "the four variables @xmath37 therefore possess a four - dimensional multivariate gaussian distribution .",
    "if a set of random variables @xmath38 have a multivariate gaussian distribution the joint probability density function of the variables has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and the correlation matrix @xmath41 .",
    "for the case we are interested in we can write @xmath42 for @xmath43 . the quantity @xmath44 is related to the power - spectrum , @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 .",
    "we can also define a quantity @xmath47 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 parameterizes the cross - correlation of the modes .",
    "we also have @xmath50 ( no summation ) , guaranteeing translation invariance @xcite , while @xmath51 in a similar fashion to @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath47 and @xmath52 may well be equal but we have kept the most general possible form here .",
    "these two parameters allow us to construct the required distribution for @xmath53 .",
    "we now convert the distribution @xmath54 of the vector @xmath55 to the distribution @xmath56 of the vector @xmath57 .",
    "the result is @xmath58 where @xmath59 in these expressions we have used @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that if @xmath62 ( no mode correlations ) this reduces to the product of two rayleigh distributions for @xmath63 and @xmath64 and two uniform distributions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the next step is to construct a conditional distribution of one of the phase angles , say @xmath28 , given specific values for the other three variables , which we designate as @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this can be done straightforwardly using bayes theorem .",
    "the result is @xmath67 , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a modified bessel function of order zero and in which @xmath69 .",
    "this conditional distribution shows how the correlation between neighboring phases arises since it depends upon @xmath66 .",
    "it is deficient , however , in that this distribution also depends on specified values for the amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "a better theory might be obtained by marginalizing over these variables , but the integrals involved are messy . on the other hand",
    "the distribution of amplitudes is relatively narrow , peaking around @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 is presumably small for quasi - nonlinear stages . under these circumstances",
    "we expect the distribution of phase differences formed over a large number of pairs to follow the form given above , i.e. @xmath75 \\label{eq : vm}.\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the mean angle .",
    "this distribution is well - known in the field of circular statistics where it is known as the _",
    "von mises _ distribution @xcite . the mean , @xmath76 , is controlled by the positions of individual features of the distribution and will consequently vary from sample to sample .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 , related to @xmath74 , describes the level of nonlinearity .",
    "when @xmath78 is small the distribution is approximately uniform , while for small @xmath77 it takes the form @xmath79 $ ] showing that initial departures from random phases manifest themselves as a sinusoidal perturbation of p(d ) . in the limit @xmath80 the distribution tends towards a single spike at @xmath81 ; this corresponds to a single concentration in position space .",
    "to test our hypothesis with fairly complete coverage of possible parameters , we used a large ensemble of gravitational clustering simulations @xcite . these comprise sets of @xmath82 particles and are not large by current standards , but the particular benefit they offer our analysis is a fairly complete coverage of parameter space",
    ". there are four realizations of each type of initial conditions , using different pseudo - random number generators to generate the initial phases .",
    "initial power spectra were pure power laws , i.e. @xmath83 with indices @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "data is taken every time the scale of clustering doubles , from @xmath88 to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the fundamental mode of the box and @xmath91 is defined by @xmath92 the first stage may be significantly compromised by resolution effects ; we have simulations with @xmath93 but these almost certainly suffer from problems connected with the boundary conditions ( which are , as usual , periodic ) .",
    "analysis of the properties of the phase differences was conducted on each realization of each spectrum and evolutionary phase , i.e. a total of 120 times altogether .",
    "we fourier - transform each stage and extract phases for each wave - vector @xmath32 . from these we obtain differences @xmath19 in three orthogonal @xmath24-space directions from which we form histograms .",
    "the mean value @xmath76 of each distribution contains information about the specific spatial location of dominant features @xcite , which will differ from realization to realization and which also varies with direction .",
    "we therefore rotate individual distributions so that they have the same mean value and `` stack '' the resulting histograms .",
    "we also combine all three directional differences into an overall histogram @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "this approach , together with the large size of the ensemble , produces final histograms with relatively small error bars , as can be seen in fig [ universe ]",
    ". some readers may find it difficult to see the data , as it overlays the theoretical model with high precision .",
    "the results show extremely good agreement over the range of initial power - spectra and evolutionary stages , although the model does break down at late stages for the case @xmath96 .",
    "this is not surprising , given the fact that such spectra have large amounts of power on large scales and phase correlations therefore develop extremely quickly .",
    "even the earliest stage shown of this simulation shows a significantly non - uniform distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "the development of phase correlations with evolutionary stage for each initial spectrum is represented by the increasing deviation from uniformity down each column starting , as expected , with sinusoidal departures .",
    "it is important to check whether deviations in the expansion rate or non power - law initial power spectra would alter these conclusions .",
    "another ensemble of simulations used the power spectrum with cdm shape parameter ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) @xmath97 . evolved in both an open ( @xmath98 , ocdm ) ,",
    "a flat matter - dominated ( @xmath99 , tcdm ) , and a flat cosmological - constant background ( @xmath98 , @xmath100 , lcdm ) all three ensembles were run to an amplitude corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "a hubble constant @xmath102 was used in the simulation analysis .",
    "these n - body runs had three realizations each of @xmath103 particles in boxes of side 128 mpc .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ cdm ] ; we found they are also nicely fit with the von mises distribution .",
    "results are shown also at @xmath104 = 1 , which further varies the normalization and background parameters , again with no significant deviation .",
    "the excellent match of the distribution ( [ eq : vm ] ) to the results of detailed numerical simulations may appear surprising given the very approximate nature of its derivation .",
    "but its validity is reinforced by the fact that it is the maximum entropy distribution on a circle for a fixed mean @xmath76 and fixed circular dispersion @xcite .",
    "it should really therefore be regarded as the circular equivalent of a gaussian distribution , which has maximal entropy for fixed mean and variance on the real line .",
    "the universal behavior we have demonstrated will allow us in future to discriminate between gravitationally - induced mode - coupling and other forms , such as that induced by peculiar motions @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , of course , that in a realistic application to a survey of galaxies , further coupling between the fourier modes would arise due to the geometry and selection function of the survey . however , this need not be problematic . if one knew the window function sufficiently accurately its fourier transform could be computed and a correction applied to the complex fourier components themselves .",
