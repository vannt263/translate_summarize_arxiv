    "the fourth united states naval observatory ( usno ) ccd astrograph catalog , ucac4 is an all - sky , astrometric catalog of 113,780,093 objects complete to about magnitude 16 ( fig .",
    "1 ) in the instrumental system , which is close to r magnitudes . it contains accurate positions and proper motions on the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) at a mean epoch around 2000 , observed magnitudes , 2-micro all - sky survey ( 2mass ) magnitudes for about 110 million stars , and aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) 5-band photometry for over 51 million stars .",
    "the published ucac4 data are a compiled catalog of positions and proper motions , based on final reductions of the ucac observational catalog of positions and many other astrometric catalogs .",
    "the usno operated the 8-inch ( 0.2 m ) twin astrograph from 1998 to 2004 for an all - sky astrometric survey .",
    "about 2/3 of the sky was observed from the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) while the rest of the northern sky was observed from the naval observatory flagstaff station ( nofs ) .",
    "a 4k by 4k ccd with 9 @xmath0 m pixel size was used at the  red lens \" of the astrograph in a single bandpass ( 579 to 643 nm ) with just over 1 square degree field of view .",
    "a 2-fold overlap pattern of fields span the entire sky . each field",
    "was observed with a long ( about 125 sec ) and a short ( about 25 sec ) exposure .",
    "thus each star should appear on at least 2 different ccd exposures , and stars in the mid - magnitude range ( about 10 to 14 ) should have 4 images .",
    "ucac4 is an incremental update of the large amount of work performed earlier to arrive at the ucac1 @xcite ) , ucac2 @xcite , and ucac3 @xcite data releases .",
    "the positional precision of the ccd observations and the mean ucac4 catalog positions are very similar to those of ucac3 ; see statistics presented in @xcite .",
    "the most significant improvement of ucac4 over ucac3 is the lower level of systematic errors in the proper motions north of the southern proper motion ( spm ) area ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "all - sky color plots of proper motions and number of stars per sky area are provided on the ucac4 release dvd .",
    "table 1 gives some general statistics about ucac4 data ( see also the  readme \" file of the public release ) .",
    "as with ucac3 , the ucac4 release catalog is based on all applicable , regular survey field observations , excluding the ccd exposures taken on extragalactic link fields and most calibration fields .",
    "observations of minor planets have been extracted and will be published separately .",
    "the released ucac4 is a compiled catalog , similar to ucac3 , and ucac2 .",
    "however , we plan to make individual epoch ccd observations available in the future if desired by the community ( please contact lead author ) . separate papers about new double stars found in the ucac observational catalog and the extragalactic link to international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) quasars are in preparation .",
    "the main differences between ucac4 and ucac3 data are the following :    bug fixes : : :    add missing stars , remove multiple entries , apply magnitude equation    ( cte ) corrections properly for all exposure times .",
    "npm data : : :    are used to derive proper motions of faint stars north of about    @xmath2 declination ; discontinue use of schmidt    plate data .",
    "systematic error corrections : : :    a final tweak of the magnitude equation corrections of the ccd data    brings the positional system of ucac4 closer to the ucac2 system .",
    "high proper motion stars : : :    were identified in the ucac observational catalog and those positions    used for ucac4 .",
    "apass : : :    dr6 photometry in the b , v , g , r and i bands added .",
    "photometric calibrations : : :    apass data are used to calibrate instrumental ucac magnitudes over the    entire dynamic range .",
    "photometric bias : : :    as function of ccd @xmath3-coordinate removed .",
    "bright stars : : :    added from fk6 , hipparcos and tycho-2 catalogs .",
    "hipparcos star numbers : : :    are linked to ucac4 data which allows easy inclusion of hipparcos    catalogue data such as parallaxes . cross reference : : :    to tycho-2 and ucac2 star catalog numbers added .",
    "ucac4 is based on the same pixel reduction as ucac3 @xcite and the same astrometric reduction pipeline from @xmath4 data to @xmath5 of individual observations @xcite was used , except for bug fixes , a minor update of the magnitude equation correction , and adopting a lower threshold to include more single observations of faint stars .",
    "positions in ucac4 are on the icrs as realized by the tycho-2 catalog , which was used as reference star catalog in a conventional , frame - by - frame , astrometric reduction after various corrections were applied , utilizing the 2mass data @xcite and east - west flip observations as described in @xcite .    instead of the bin - by - bin corrections for the poor charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) effect on positions",
    "as used for ucac3 , a smooth function with magnitude was adopted for the ucac4 reductions using the same calibration data ( based on 2mass ) as before .",
    "cte corrections for the 200 and 40 sec exposures ( mainly used for the extragalactic link program ) as well as for 5 and 10 sec exposures were not applied correctly for ucac3 .",
    "this bug has been fixed for ucac4 , affecting only few ccd frames .",
    "overall the astrometric accuracy of ucac4 observational positions has not changed significantly from the ucac3 release .",
    "the missing stars and multiple entries of some stars in ucac3 were traced back to a bug in the merge stage of individual observations to mean ccd - based positions . this problem was corrected and a limit of 2.0 arcsec was imposed to combine images to a single star .",
    "this change lead to more stars with a blended image flag in ucac4 than before ; however , it avoids listing unrealistic close ,  resolved \" companions of unreal double stars . after checking sample double stars discovered in ucac data with the 26-inch speckle camera ,",
    "potentially new real double stars were identified in ucac4 and will be published separately .    for ucac4 , an even lower threshold was adopted for faint observed images to enter intermediate star lists , including objects with positions based on center - of - mass centroid instead of a successful image profile fit .",
    "however , these objects entered the ucac4 catalog only if either a match with at least another observation existed , or a 2mass match could be established , or a reasonable proper motion could be obtained by matches with early epoch data .",
    "whenever no formal position error from the ccd data of a star could be derived ( no successful image profile center fit , for whatever reason ) the positional error was set to 900 mas ( 1 pixel ) , which leads to early mean epochs and large proper motion errors when combined with other catalogs to arrive at the ucac4 compiled catalog data .",
    "this approach allowed the completeness level of the ucac4 catalog to be pushed to a new high with an estimated 110 million real stars ( and about 92,000 galaxies ) , but also allowed some artifacts to enter ucac4 , estimated to be on the few percent level , particularly near bright , overexposed stars .",
    "as with ucac3 , overexposed stars were propagated in the catalog production pipeline for reasons of completeness . for those stars , and other problematic images , the image center fit often failed , which is indicated in the catalog by the number of `` used images '' being zero . in these cases",
    "no fit position could be obtained , instead the provided position is only approximate , based on the centroid ( first moments ) of the light distribution in the pixel data .",
    "contrary to ucac3 , all stars brighter than observed magnitude 8.5 in ucac4 were compared to external catalogs and astrometric data from these were substituted when deemed more reliable than ucac observations ( see section 6.2 ) .      as with ucac3 , ucac4 gives 2 observed magnitude estimates , based on the volume of the image profile model fitted , and a true aperture photometry .",
    "extinction coefficients are derived for each exposure with respect to tycho-2 stars adopting a linear model with b@xmath6v color .",
    "thus a photometric zero - point was determined for each ccd exposure and applied to the instrumental magnitudes to arrive at our bandpass magnitudes based on the available tycho-2 stars in a given field .",
    "early apass dr2 data of 9 million stars distributed all over the sky were used for photometric calibrations of ucac - observed ccd magnitudes .",
    "contrary to previous releases , a photometric bias as a function of the pixel @xmath3-coordinate was removed in the instrumental magnitudes before constructing the ucac4 catalog .",
    "this bias is caused by the poor cte performance of the detector and affects the model and aperture magnitudes similarly , but not identically .",
    "the bias is also a function of magnitude and slightly depends on exposure time .",
    "2 shows examples for 2 ranges in brightness .",
    "a linear model was adopted to correct for this bias with respect to the center of the ccd field .",
    "different slope parameters as a function of @xmath3-pixel coordinate were applied for nofs and ctio data , as well as for long and short exposures and binned by magnitude group .",
    "linear interpolation by magnitude was adopted for applying corrections .",
    "the largest effect of this bias is about @xmath7 mag .",
    "the following procedure was performed separately for ucac4 aperture and model magnitudes to correct for the non - linearity of the ucac instrumental magnitudes .",
    "a preliminary ucac magnitude was calculated after applying the @xmath3-pixel bias correction and using tycho-2 stars for the photometric zero point .",
    "this ucac preliminary magnitude was then compared to the apass r magnitude and magnitude differences plotted as a function of apass ( v@xmath6r ) , see fig .",
    "this color - color diagram was fitted with linear and second order polynomials in sections to allow calculation of an estimated ucac - bandpass magnitude when only apass v and r are given .",
    "very blue ( v@xmath6r @xmath8 @xmath60.1 ) and very red ( v@xmath6r @xmath9 1.0 ) stars were excluded in this process .",
    "the differences between ucac4 observed and ucac - bandpass estimated magnitudes ( from apass v , r ) as a function of ucac observed magnitude ( fig .",
    "4 ) give the desired corrections to the preliminay ucac magnitudes to make them linear with respect to the apass photometric system .",
    "a zero - point offset is included in these corrections to force the resulting ucac@xmath6apass(r ) color to be zero for ( v@xmath6r ) = 0 .",
    "as noted in earlier releases , the largest deviations of the ucac magnitude scale is seen at bright magnitudes near saturation , requiring a correction on the order of 0.5 mag .",
    "the faint end needed a correction of about 0.3 mag .",
    "for ucac4 , the use of the apass data allowed these magnitude scale and offset corrections to be determined much more accurately and reliably than in earlier releases .",
    "finally , the corrected ucac magnitudes were run through the tycho-2 zero - point routine again to arrive at the calibrated magnitudes of individual ccd frames . combining individual ccd frame photometry to mean catalog magnitudes and calculating error estimates",
    "were performed in the same way as for ucac3 @xcite .",
    "remaining sytematic errors in ucac4 observed magnitudes are estimated to be about 0.05 to 0.1 magnitudes , because many ucac observations were performed under non - photometric sky conditions , and the imperfection of the applied corrections .",
    "the later is most pronounced around magnitude 9 as for example can be seen as slight discontinuity in the fig .  1 histogram .",
    "this is a magnitude calibration issue and not a missing star issue .",
    "the ucac4 catalog heavily relies on the ac2000.2 astrographic catalogue @xcite , unpublished data from over 5000 astrograph plates measured with the starscan machine @xcite , the npm @xcite , @xcite , and the spm @xcite , @xcite data . all procedures to derive the ucac4 proper motions remained the same as for earlier releases , see for example the ucac1 paper @xcite .",
    "most of the early epoch catalog used to derive ucac4 proper motions also remain the same as for ucac3 .",
    "however , lick observatory northern proper motion ( npm ) 1st epoch data ( lick1 catalog ) were used for ucac4 , and field zero - point corrections for the yale - san juan southern proper motion ( spm ) 1st epoch data ( ysj1 catalog ) were applied .",
    "both sets of plates were digitized at the precision measure machine ( pmm ) @xcite at nofs , with subsequent data reductions as a joined effort by yale university and usno , washington @xcite .",
    "thus , for ucac4 , no schmidt survey plate data were used at all , which lead to a significant improvement in the ucac proper motions north of the spm sky area ( @xmath10 ) .    as with ucac3 , only the first epoch ,",
    "blue spm plate material was utilized for ucac4 proper motions of faint stars in the south . in the meantime",
    ", the yale astrometry group completed their reductions and derived a catalog of positions and absolute proper motions based on early and recent epoch spm project observations , the spm4 , @xcite utilizing galaxies to establish the proper motion zero - point .",
    "due to the common first epoch data , even with differences in the reduction algorithms , the spm4 and ucac4 proper motions will be correlated .",
    "table 2 provides statistics about matches of ucac4 stars with other catalogs as used to derive proper motions .",
    "all applicable lick observatory northern proper motion ( npm ) first epoch plates ( blue sensitive emulsion ) were used to construct a star catalog with mean epoch near 1950 covering the about @xmath11 area of sky .",
    "these were among the earliest plates scanned on pmm and no pixel data could be saved at the time .",
    "the provided data were the @xmath4 pixel locations of stellar images measured on individual pmm ccd  footprints \" with the pmm pipeline mapping parameters already applied .    in order to be able to run these data through the starscan @xcite pipeline ,",
    "the previously applied pmm modelling was removed to obtain raw @xmath4 pixel centroid data .",
    "the starscan pipeline then generated new , global @xmath4 data on the coordinate system of a plate using improved modelling .",
    "the global @xmath4 data then was sent to the yale astrometry group for further astrometric reductions to obtain @xmath5 coordinates on the sky , applying elaborate systematic error corrections by utilizing the various orders of grating images and 2 sets of exposures in each field .",
    "these procedures follow closely the reduction process of the spm plates @xcite , with some modifications due to differences in magnitude overlaps of grating images between spm and npm data . the resulting , unpublished catalog  lick1 \" of over 168 million stars and galaxies",
    "was sent to usno , washington , to provide the early epoch positions of faint stars for ucac4 proper motions .      despite the great care taken to control systematic errors as a function of magnitude and @xmath4 location , residual magnitude equations remain in the npm and spm first epoch data , the lick1 and ysj1 catalogs .",
    "first , the field - dependent systematic errors were corrected , then the overall zero - point of the proper motions per npm and spm field .",
    "all ucac stars with preliminary proper motions were associated with the nearest field centers of npm and spm plates . a tangential plane projection then provides the @xmath4 location of ucac stars on npm and spm plates .",
    "the preliminary ucac proper motions , derived only from the ccd data mean positions and npm or spm first epoch positions were binned ( 0.5 degree ) on the npm and spm plate pattern separately for various declination zones but combining data from several fields along right ascension ( ra ) . mean proper motions per @xmath4 bin were calculated excluding the high and low 20% of proper motions in each bin .",
    "5 shows an example of such a vector plot of artificial mean proper motions in the tangential plane of npm fields . excluding 10% or 30% ( instead of 20% ) of the high and low proper motions in this process yields almost identical results .",
    "typical systematic error vectors are 0.5 to 2 mas / yr with a formal error of about 0.12 mas / yr on average for the npm fields and somewhat smaller corrections for the spm data .",
    "no physical reason exists for such a pattern in the average proper motions of stars on the sky on such small scales ( @xmath12 1 degree ) , repeating with the pattern of npm and spm fields .",
    "thus , the differences in proper motions seen here between bins are systematic errors in the npm and spm data .",
    "differences in proper motions from bin to bin were translated by the known epoch difference to positional offsets at the respective npm or spm epoch and corrections applied to the first epoch npn and spm catalog positions respectively , keeping the proper motions at the field centers unchanged .",
    "separate patterns were derived for these corrections per declination zone .",
    "variations as a function of declination were found to be insignificant and a combined pattern was established for npm and spm respectively , which was used to apply the corrections .",
    "these corrections are dominated by faint stars in the about 14 to 16 mag range with an average absolute correction of about 1 and 0.25 micrometer for the npm and spm fields , respectively , with the largest corrections about 3 times larger than the average .      here ,",
    "we follow a procedure adopted for the construction of the spm4 catalog @xcite . besides systematic errors as a function of @xmath4 location on npm or spm plates , an overall magnitude equation ( field by field ) was found when looking at proper motions of galaxies . in order to utilize as many galaxies as possible ,",
    "the entire lick1 ( npm ) and ysj1 ( spm ) catalogs were matched with the 2mass extended source catalog , not just those objects present in ucac .",
    "position differences between 2mass and lick1 catalog positions were calculated for over 678,000 galaxies with formal position errors less than 400 mas and averaged by lick1 field .",
    "the positional offsets of typically 100 mas are attributed to systematic errors in the lick1 data at an average magnitude around r = 16 .",
    "similarly , average position differences between lick1 and the hipparcos catalogue ( using hipparcos proper motions ) were calculated field - by - field for a total of over 68,000 acceptable stars at the lick1 epoch . again , the position offset was attributed to systematic errors in the lick1 data at a mean magnitude of about 7.5 . of the 1390 npm fields in lick1",
    ", a total of 1347 were found with sufficient data from both the galaxies and hipparcos stars . for the remaining fields ,",
    "no corrections were applied .",
    "an example of the results is shown in fig .  6 for a range of fields and the @xmath3-coordinate ( along ra ) .",
    "the position differences with hipparcos are less pronounced than in this example for the @xmath13-coordinate ( declination ) .",
    "results for the spm ( ysj1 ) data are similar with pronounced systematic offsets for the hipparcos data ( @xmath14 200 mas ) and low significant , small offsets for the galaxy data , similar to npm .",
    "a linear magnitude equation in the lick1 data was assumed between the position offsets at the bright end ( hipparcos stars ) and faint end ( galaxies ) .",
    "the full correction , as derived from the above procedure , was applied whenever the formal error on the position offsets ( for hipparcos stars and galaxies separately ) is less than 50 mas . for larger errors per field and coordinate the above derived corrections were scaled down by a factor of 50 mas divided by formal error .",
    "then , the position difference between bright and faint offsets was divided by the 8.5 magnitude difference to arrive at the magnitude equation slope .",
    "positions of all lick1 objects were then corrected differentially for this magnitude equation to force the position offsets ( lick1 - hipparcos , lick1 - galaxies ) to zero .",
    "the ysj1 ( spm ) data was handled in the same way .",
    "stars with high proper motions ( hpm ) were handled specifically . in the north the lspm - north catalog @xcite of 61977 new and previously known high proper motion stars having proper motions greater than 0.15``/yr was used . in the south , many smaller surveys along with the revised nltt catalog @xcite were used , which produced 17730 unique high proper motion stars greater than 0.15''/yr . in",
    "both the north and south a supplemental list of proper motion stars greater than  0.15\" / yr from the tycho-2 and hipparcos catalogs was used to fill in any gaps . in chronological order ,",
    "the smaller southern surveys used include : ( 1 ) 7 papers covering various portions of the southern sky by wroblewski and collaborators ( wroblewski & torres 1989 , 1991 , 1994 , 1996 , 1997 ; wroblewski & costa 1999 , 2001 ) , ( 2 ) uk schmidt telescope survey plates of 40 survey fields by scholz and collaborators @xcite , ( 3 ) the calan - eso survey @xcite ( 4 ) supercosmos - recons proper - motion survey of the entire southern sky ( henry et al . 2004 ; subasavage et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b ; finch et al . 2007 ; boyd et al . 2011 ) , ( 5 ) the southern infrared proper - motion survey ( sips ; deacon et al .",
    "2005 ) , ( 6 ) lepine s superblink survey of a portion of the southern sky @xcite and ( 7 ) ucac3 proper motion survey ( finch et al . 2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "then , we identified these stars in our ccd observations using a 2-step approach .",
    "for each individual exposure we established a list of hpm stars which could be present in that field .",
    "hpm star positions were calculated for the epoch of that exposure and then matched with the individual ra , dec observations of that exposure to identify and flag hpm stars on each exposure ( object type = 3 ) .",
    "contrary to ucac3 , a ucac4-based solution for mean position and proper motion was attempted for all stars , including the hpm stars .",
    "the position and proper motion solution obtained by the above procedure was substituted by zero proper motion and the mean ccd data position at mean observational epoch for the following cases :    * proper motion ( pm ) solution failed or showed large errors ( @xmath9 500 mas , @xmath9 50 mas / yr ) * derived pm is larger than 500 mas / yr in either component * derived mean epoch is earlier than 1947 * difference between mean catalog position and mean ccd data position is @xmath9 3 arcsec    the mean ccd position of a star is the ucac observed position obtained by combining data of individual exposures of that star .",
    "stars with early mean epoch are problematic ; including poor ccd position data or possible mismatches across involved catalogs .",
    "the stars cut by the above criteria are thus added to the group of  no proper motion \" stars , i.e.  those that did not match up with other catalogs to even begin the proper motion calculation .",
    "all stars were then checked against the external set of hpm stars .",
    "the pm from the external catalog was used for stars with no ucac4 pm solution and for those where the difference in pm for either component exceeded 40 mas / yr .",
    "thus , we trust the external catalog data more than the ucac4 derived proper motions in those cases .",
    "for the following comparisons with the ucac4 release data , only stars with unique , single matches to the respective catalogs were used .",
    "a match radius of 2.0 arcsec was adopted for positions at the desired common match epoch , by applying proper motions as specified below .",
    "tests with a match radius of 1.0 arcsec gave almost identical results .",
    "figures 7 to 12 illustrate the systematic differences between the ucac4 and ucac2 data releases regarding magnitude and positions , for the southern and northern hemisphere separately .",
    "almost all of the 48.3 million entries in ucac2 were matched with ucac4 .",
    "for the figures we excluded flagged double stars as well as stars with a formal position error larger than 150 mas .",
    "the differences in photometry between ucac4 and ucac2 display small scatter but complex , large systematic offsets ( figs .  7 , 8) .",
    "the ucac4 photometric system is expected to be significantly better than the ucac2 data due to the better calibrations .",
    "figs .  7 and 8 show results for aperture photometry , while results for model magnitudes are very similar .",
    "largest differences are seen at the bright end where ucac2 data suffers from uncalibrated non - linearities near saturation , which already were removed in ucac3 .",
    "small discontinuities on the 0.02 mag level seen in fig .",
    "8 are not of any concern because ucac magnitudes will have larger local systematic errors anyway .    figs .",
    "9 and 10 show the systematic position differences ( at epoch 2000 ) between ucac4 and ucac2 for the southern and northern hemisphere , respectively , as a function of magnitude .",
    "systematic differences are only a few up to 10 mas over the entire range .",
    "the relative differences ( shape of these patterns ) is determined mainly by differences in the cte calibration models used for the data sets , while the absolute zero - point is determined by the mean of tycho-2 stars around magnitude 10 to 11 ( common system between ucac2 , ucac4 , and tycho-2 by design ) .",
    "11 and 12 show the ucac4@xmath6ucac2 position differences as a function of declination .",
    "the mean offset in these figures is determined by the mean offset in the previous figures at faint magnitudes , where the majority of stars are .",
    "local variations in these data are very small ( few mas ) with the exception of @xmath15 around + 50@xmath16 , where the ucac2 data runs out and only a small range in ra is being averaged over .",
    "figures 13 and 14 show position differences between ucac4 and 2mass as a function of magnitude , for the southern and northern hemisphere , respectively .",
    "the ucac4 proper motions are used to bring the ucac4 positions to the 2mass epoch ( about 1998 to 2002 ) for each individual star matched uniquely within 2 arcsec .",
    "figures 15 and 16 show these position differences as a function of declination .",
    "each dot represents the mean over 3000 stars , excluding stars with a ucac4 double star flag and those with an estimated position error larger than 150 mas .",
    "this exclusion effectively cuts stars fainter than about 16.5 mag .",
    "the systematic ucac4 minus 2mass position differences are typically about 10 mas , with additional local systematic variations .",
    "the sawtooth pattern can be explained by residual systematic errors in the ucac4 proper motions , based on lick1 and ysj1 data ( 5 degrees is the size of individual npm , spm plate fields ) .",
    "for those first epoch data no position averaging over plate boundaries was performed .",
    "plots similar to fig .  13 and 14 comparing 2mass with ucac3 and ucac2 were presented in the ucac3 release paper @xcite .",
    "we note that the position system of ucac4 agrees better with 2mass than did ucac3 .",
    "this is the result of a better magnitude dependent correction ( cte ) for faint stars in ucac4 versus ucac3 .",
    "note , although 2mass positions were not directly used in the ucac4 final astrometric  plate \" solution , 2mass data were used to correct some magnitude dependent systematic errors in ucac4 data .",
    "thus 2mass and ucac4 are somewhat correlated .      to highlight possible systematic errors in proper motions between various catalogs , a random slice of the sky between right ascension 6.0 and 6.1 hours was picked .",
    "such a slice is narrow enough to sample parts of individual first epoch plates instead of averaging over an entire zone or several plates .",
    "thus , limitations in astrometric calibrations as a function of the location of stars on the @xmath4 plane of a plate will become apparent .",
    "the ucac4 was matched with the ppmxl @xcite , xpm @xcite , and spm4 @xcite catalogs and differences in proper motions are plotted as function of declination in figs .",
    "the range of @xmath17 is choosen to give sufficient coverage from the spm data .",
    "the difference between xpm and ppmxl can be inferred by taking the differences between the ucac4@xmath6xpm and ucac4@xmath6ppmxl plots .",
    "all catalogs are somewhat correlated , for example , the ucac4 and spm4 share some first epoch astrograph data , and xpm and ppmxl share schmidt plates survey data",
    ". nevertheless , significant systematic differences in proper motions between all catalogs typically on the 2 mas / yr level , up to about 6 mas / yr locally are apparent , with the ucac4 vs.  spm4 differences being somewhat smaller .",
    "ucac4 proper motions in ra vs.  proper motions in dec is plotted in fig .  20 for a field around the open cluster m67 .",
    "stars within 20 arcmin of the cluster center and with formal , random errors in proper motion @xmath8 7 mas / yr per component ( which excludes 4% of the stars ) are plotted . from these ucac4 data , the mean proper motion of the cluster",
    "is found to be about @xmath18 = @xmath69.5 mas / yr and @xmath19 = @xmath64.5 mas / yr with an estimated formal error of about 1 mas / yr ( and expected systematic errors somewhat larger than that ) .",
    "these values compare very well with the published absolute proper motion for m67 ( @xmath69.6 and @xmath63.7 mas / yr ) from a recent paper @xcite based on cfht data and tied to galaxies .",
    "the ucac4 data files are organized in 0.2 degree wide declination zones , numbered from 1 to 900 beginning at the south celestial pole . within each zone ,",
    "stars are sorted by ascending right ascension .",
    "these 900 zone files are binary , containing 78-bytes fixed length records with integers for each catalog entry ( mostly stars ) .",
    "the byte order is that of the native intel - type processor binary data format .",
    "for some computers , a byte - swap might be needed .",

    "the online version provides real numbers in ascii format versus the original integer data and gives declination in degree while the dvd release gives south pole distance in mas ( table 3 ) .",
    "the official star identification name is of the format ucac4-zzz - nnnnnn .",
    "the 3 digit `` zzz '' number is the zone number for a star , while `` nnnnnn '' is the 6 digit record number for that star along its zone file ( with leading zeros , if needed ) .",
    "similar to previous releases , ucac4 is a compiled catalog giving the weighted mean position and proper motion of stars based on all input catalogs , including the ccd data .",
    "subject to available resources , usno plans to release the individual ccd observations ( positions at epoch ) . to obtain this about 50 gb large dataset",
    ", please contact the lead author .",
    "ucac4 does contain about 92,000 galaxies .",
    "no star / galaxy separation parameter based on pixel data is present in ucac4 .",
    "however , flags are provided that indicate matches with known non - stellar objects , from the 2mass extended source catalog , the leda galaxy catalog , and non - stellar flags copied from the spm data .",
    "contrary to previous releases , ucac4 was supplemented by bright stars in the attempt to provide a catalog complete from the brightest naked eye stars to about r = 16 .",
    "first , information from the tycho-2 and hipparcos ( including annexes ) catalogs were merged with fk6 @xcite data . in order of priority ,",
    "astrometric data are taken from fk6 if available , else from the 2007 hipparcos release @xcite , else from the original hipparcos catalogue @xcite , else from tycho-2 @xcite .",
    "this combined catalog of over 2.5 million stars was matched with ucac4 and stars not found in ucac4 observational data within 2 arcsec were added to the ucac4 release catalog .",
    "also , a total of 2 high proper motion stars was added manually . for these supplemented stars as well as for all ucac4 entries identified as hipparcos stars ,",
    "a unique star i d number ( column 51 of the zone files ) of below 1 million was assigned and additional data provided in a separate table indexed with that star number .",
    "thus most of the hipparcos catalogue data ( including parallaxes ) are linked to ucac4 entries .",
    "a cross reference to the tycho-2 catalog was created and added to the release in a separate file .",
    "this file contains 2,549,788 entries linking the original tycho-2 star number ( 3 parts ) to the official ucac4 star number ( zone number and record along zone ) and the main data table column 51 entry ( single , unique star i d number ) .",
    "the ucac4 is the final release of this project , providing an all - sky , astrometric catalog to r=16 magnitude .",
    "21 shows the distribution of mean epochs of ucac4 stars .",
    "the recent epoch ccd observations dominate , while for some stars the mean epoch can go back several decades . for these stars",
    "the weight of the ccd observations used in the calculation of proper motion is low , which can happen due to a number of reasons like faintness of star or elongated image due to multiplicity .",
    "fig.22 shows the distribution of ucac4 proper motions ( here for the ra component ) on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the declination proper motion distribution looks very similar .",
    "the overdensities near 100 and 200 mas / yr are likely caused by contaminations of stars with mis - matched positions between early and late epoch data at the cut - off match threshold .",
    "23 shows the distribution of ucac4 formal position errors at mean epoch , which peaks near 18 mas .",
    "most stars have formal position errors of between 15 and 100 mas , depending on magnitude .",
    "real position errors at current epoch are larger due to propagation of proper motion errors and additional systematic errors",
    ". the positions at mean epoch in ucac4 are closer to the ucac2 and 2mass systems than those of the ucac3 release .",
    "ucac4 also contains more stars and includes bug fixes that makes ucac3 obsolete now .",
    "24 shows the distribution of ucac4 formal proper motion errors which peaks at 4 mas / yr . the small overdensities near 18 mas / yr and 32 mas / yr are caused by the adopted position error of 900 mas for no - fit ccd positions in the proper motion calculation process .",
    "the mean epochs of ccd observations , spm , and npm data are about 2000 , 1972 and 1950 , respectively which lead to about 32 and 18 mas / yr formal proper motion errors .",
    "entries in ucac4 with a formal proper motion error larger than about 12 mas / yr should be considered problematic and might not correspond to real stars .",
    "systematic errors in proper motions are estimated to be on the few mas / yr level as indicated by external comparisons with other high precision ( nearly ) global catalogs which all claim to be on the same inertial system , the icrs ( fig .  17 to 19 ) .",
    "2mass near - ir photometry has been added to ucac4 as with earlier releases .",
    "for the first time a large fraction ( about half ) of the stars in ucac4 now also list precise optical photometry in up to 5 bands from the apass dr6 including some single observations .",
    "apass v and r magnitudes of dr2 were used to calibrate the ucac4 observed magnitudes ( fig .",
    "25 ) , which should be more reliable than in any previous ucac release .",
    "the ucac4 magnitudes are near the sloan r magnitudes and between v and r.    an effort was made to utilize block adjustment ( ba ) techniques @xcite for the final ucac release .",
    "however , simulations indicated that the small size of individual ccd images combined with the only 2-fold overlap pattern leads to very slow convergence . in light of still remaining systematic position errors in ucac data on the 10 to 20 mas level ,",
    "much more elaborate simultions are needed to prove any improvement of a ba solution of ucac data over the classical solution adopted for ucac4 .",
    "therefore the ba solution of the data has not been pursued further at this time .",
    "reductions of the extragalactic link data of ucac is still in progress .",
    "there are indications for both local reference star zonal errors as well as blended images or host galaxy contamination of some sources when looking at the optical@xmath6radio position differences of icrf sources ( zacharias , zacharias & finch , 2012 ) .",
    "however , no revised ucac release after ucac4 is planned .",
    "significant improvements in global astrometry will come from new observations .",
    "the usno robotic astrometric telescope ( urat ) project is already underway ( www.usno.navy.mil/usno/astrometry/optical-ir-prod/urat ) .",
    "we would like to thank everyone involved in the monumental npm and spm projects , in particular bill van altena , arnold klemola , burton jones and bob hanson . for a complete acknowledgement regarding the ucac project",
