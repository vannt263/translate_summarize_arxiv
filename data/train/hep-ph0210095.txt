    "inflation provides the creation of scalar , vector and tensor perturbations in the metric ; the scalar ones may be the origin of the formation of large scale structures , the vector ones decayed away , and the tensor ones gave rise to a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "it is possible to extract informations about the features of the spectra of these primordial perturbations from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , or from measurements of the matter power spectrum from large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the observable variables are the power spectral indices of the density and tensor perturbations , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , and the overall amplitude of these , usually denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the knowledge of these quantities allows us first of all to test the inflationary scenario , by checking if the theoretically predicted consistency relation is satisfied by the observational values ; and then , eventually , to reconstruct the scalar - field potential . the usual way to express these",
    "spectra is by a taylor expansion in the deviation from scale invariance , which can be directly related to the slow roll expansion in the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "each observable quantity can then be related to the parameters in the slow roll expansion .",
    "the evolution of the observables during inflation can be followed by the flow - equations  @xcite , and in  @xcite it was found , that the lines @xmath7 and @xmath8 act as attractors for the evolution in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "this result provides a new relation between the variables @xmath0 and @xmath10 , which the authors suggest can be used as a second consistency relation in interpreting cmb results .",
    "a subsequent analysis found  @xcite that by combining the observational bounds with the flow - equations , a non - trivial constraint on the value of the third derivative of the inflaton potential can be obtained .",
    "recently kinney ( 2002 ) generalized the inflationary flow equations to arbitrary order in slow roll , and numerically integrated them after a truncation at the fifth order . in this way one can consider the clustering of points in the tridimensional parameter space , including the running of the spectral index , and hence generalizing the results of  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will extend the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite and show that a combination of the higher order flow - equations and the observational bound on the inflationary parameters allows one to put a non - trivial constraint on the fourth derivative of the inflaton potential .",
    "slow roll models are traditionally defined through the three parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are related to the first , second , and third derivative of the inflaton potential with respect to the inflaton field @xmath13  ( to simplify the expression we avoid write the reduced planck mass , @xmath14  gev ) @xmath15 assuming that @xmath16 and @xmath17 satisfy the flatness conditions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , one finds that the scalar spectral index @xmath0 , the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 , and the running of the spectral index @xmath20 , all observable quantities , can be expressed in terms of the slow roll parameters as @xmath21 with the definition @xmath22 and where the factor @xmath23 depends on the given cosmology  @xcite , in particular on the value of @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in this paper we will use the value @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "( [ epslignt ] ) are truncated at order @xmath12 , ignoring errors that are quadratic in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and requiring that @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the third expression shows us that every time we take the derivative of a slow roll parameter we get a quantity which is one order higher in slow roll , and we therefore need to introduce the new parameter @xmath30 .    from the set of equations  ( [ epslignt ] )",
    "one can derive a system of differential equations which describes the evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the inflaton rolls down its potential , and is only weakly dependent on the form of the potential itself . by taking , at first order , @xmath31 , where @xmath13 is the inflaton field",

    ". the second derivative of the scalar spectral index takes the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 , which in our approximation is negligible or zero . by using the definitions in eqs .",

    ", we will need to assume that either @xmath34 or @xmath33 can be treated as a constant throughout inflation .",
    "the choice between these two assumptions is arbitrary , but will affect the behavior of the flow in the parameter space .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the observational bounds which we will use are the ones obtained in @xcite ( for similar results see  @xcite ) @xmath41 such observations can be inverted to give constraints on the inflationary potential and its derivatives .",

    "we will study the flow in the three dimensional parameter space @xmath46 , and by also making use of the observational constraints ( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) , we will be able to induce a limit on the fourth derivative of the potential , @xmath33 .",
    "in slow roll inflation , the scales relevant for structure formation crossed outside the horizon roughly @xmath47 e - folds before the end of inflation @xcite , and it is at this time that the experimental bounds on the observable parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) apply .",
    "we are going to consider only the case of single field inflation , which will end when the slow roll conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are violated . in terms of the value of the parameters",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 , these conditions translate into the sr `` validity - region '' @xcite @xmath50 using the evolution equations ( [ flow3]-[flow5 ] ) , we let all the points of the boundary ( [ boundary ] ) flow back 50 e - folds ( we take the value @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is done for different fixed values of the parameter @xmath34 ( or @xmath33 ) .",
    "we can then induce a constraint on this latter by demanding that , at @xmath52 , at least some of the points of the boundary land inside that region in the @xmath53 space which is allowed by observations , eqs .",
    "( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) .",
    "if no points land inside the space allowed by observations , then we can deduce that we took an unrealistic value for the parameter @xmath34 or @xmath33 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    to follow the flow backwards in time , the slow roll conditions ( [ boundary ] ) provide us with the initial values for the two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as initial condition for the variable @xmath54 we will take eq .",
    "( [ flow1 ] ) , with the extra assumption that @xmath55 .",
    "we verified that the position of the points after 50 e - fold is virtually independent on the initial conditions chosen , and therefore this assumption does not affect our results .",
    "moreover , with these initial conditions and in the case @xmath56 , all the points of the boundary flow into the validity region . for other cases ( e.g. @xmath57 )",
    "we exclude numerically the possibility that a point could first flow outside this validity region and then later re - enter the region .    in the case where @xmath34 is treated as a constant during the last 50 e - folds , we find that for @xmath58 there are no final points in agreement with observations .",
    "this is easily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which the dashed line which corresponds to the value @xmath59 is about to exit from the region given by the observational limits , eq .",
    "( [ obsns ] ) . on the other hand , we are not able to induce any limit on the parameter @xmath34 in the case @xmath60 , because for sufficiently small value of @xmath1 there will always be points in the allowed region .",
    "if one instead assumes that @xmath33 can be treated as a constant during inflation , the curve which represent the evolved validity region exceeds the observational boundary if @xmath61 .",
    "also in this case there will always be acceptable points if @xmath33 takes positive values , however , also in this case only for very small @xmath1 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in conclusion , we have shown that the combination of the slow roll equations ( [ flow3]-[flow5 ] ) and the observational results ( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) leads to a lower bound @xmath62 , for single field models which end inflation by breaking the slow roll conditions ( [ boundary ] ) . with a larger number of e - folds this bound becomes slightly stronger .",
