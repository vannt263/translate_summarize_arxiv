    "dynamical arrest in soft matter can generally be divided into two classes , glasses and gels .",
    "arrest is exhibited by a wide variety of systems , including those which can be treated as spheres with attractions which include colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite and protein solutions @xcite .",
    "dynamical arrest occurs upon either a global increase in density ( vitrification ) or arrested phase separation ( gelation ) . in the latter case ,",
    "phase separation is suppressed as the system undergoes arrest to form a non - equilibrium gel state , which we define as a percolating assembly of particles @xcite which do not relax on the experimental timescale .    in colloid - polymer mixtures ,",
    "addition of sufficient polymer causes demixing into two or more phases @xcite . in a one - component description , the degrees of freedom of the polymers are formally integrated out , leading to an effective attraction between the colloidal particles",
    "whose range is fixed by the ratio of the polymer and colloid diameters @xmath1 @xcite and whose strength is set by the polymer concentration . to a reasonable approximation , polymer concentration plays the role of inverse temperature .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram is well - known : short - range interactions lead to only fluid - crystal phase coexistence , along with a metastable fluid - fluid binodal .",
    "however as the interaction range increases to @xmath2 , fluid - fluid phase separation produces a stable colloidal liquid and colloidal gas @xcite .",
    "while the topology of the phase diagram is well - known , the case of metastable amorphous states presents some challenges to theory and simulation @xcite .",
    "smaller polymers lead to a shorter interaction range @xmath1 , so that upon demixing , the colloids are closer together and thus the volume fraction of the colloid - rich phase @xmath3 is increased @xcite .",
    "deep quenches ( higher polymer concentration ) may also raise @xmath3 . during phase separation ,",
    "if @xmath3 reaches volume fractions at which dynamical arrest occurs ( @xmath4 ) , demixing is suppressed and a gel results @xcite . in the absence of crystallisation , such a system is nonetheless metastable to colloidal liquid - gas coexistence .",
    "[ figphasediagramschematic ] shows a schematic sketch of the effect of interaction range on the phase behaviour ( ignoring crystal phases ) @xcite .",
    "although such polydisperse dense ( colloidal ) liquids may be metastable to the formation of size - segregated crystals @xcite , to the best of our knowledge this has not been observed in experiments .",
    "consequently , while most theoretical treatments necessarily consider the equilibrium monodisperse case where colloidal liquids are found up to @xmath5 ( a regime in which dynamical arrest is not expected ) , the local volume fraction in the ` arms ' of a gel may be higher in experiments due to polydispersity .",
    "although mean - field theories exist where the metastable gas - liquid binodal and spinodal can be calculated @xcite , such predictions have limited accuracy for many polymer - colloid size ratios @xcite .",
    "previous work has largely focused on gelation in systems with short - range attractions , typically with polymer - colloid size ratios @xmath6@xcite such that there is no equilibrium colloidal liquid phase . in such systems",
    ", gelation occurs upon crossing the metastable fluid - fluid spinodal@xcite .",
    "in contrast , phase separation and its arrest in colloid - polymer mixtures with medium - to - long range attractions , where there is a stable colloidal liquid phase , are much less understood .",
    "recent simulation@xcite and experimental data@xcite suggest that a liquid - like colloid - rich phase exists , which grows continuously in length scale as the system ages .    for long - range ( @xmath7 ) systems , we suggest two regimes of interest in relation to the gas - liquid binodal - shallow and deep quenches . for shallow quenches ,",
    "the kinetics of phase separation in colloid - polymer mixtures is analogous to liquid - liquid demixing in molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the structural evolution can be described by the cahn - hilliard theory of spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "several regimes are distinguished by the growth rate of the wavelength of density fluctuations . immediately after quenching , a fastest - growing dominant mode @xmath8 appears with a wavelength @xmath9 , which exhibits time - dependent growth , with the power - law exponent changing from @xmath10 to 1 as the system evolves from the diffusive into the hydrodynamic coarsening regime .",
    "the characteristic domain size associated with the wavelength grows until it approaches the capillary length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the interfacial tension and @xmath13 the density difference between the two phases , at which point any gravity - driven flow may rupture the bicontinuous structure @xcite .",
    "previous work on spinodal decomposition in colloid - polymer mixtures has shown that the crossover between diffusive and hydrodynamic regimes is broad and continuous , and both theory and experiment indicate that , depending on the importance of hydrodynamic interactions , the exponent may vary between 0.2 and 1.1 @xcite .",
    "quenching more deeply , the volume fraction of the colloidal liquid increases @xcite .",
    "the volume fraction of the colloid - rich phase may then approach @xmath14 , the point at which slow dynamics set in for hard spheres .",
    "coarsening may therefore be suppressed and the bicontinuous network generated by the initial spinodal decomposition becomes partially or , in the limit of very short - range systems , even completely arrested on the experimental timescale @xcite .",
    "the viscosity difference between the phases may be reminiscent of the viscoelastic phase separation proposed by tanaka @xcite .",
    "in this work we explore these phase separation regimes in colloid - polymer mixtures with intermediate - to - long range attractions ( @xmath15 ) using confocal microscopy .",
    "our data suggest that there is a continuous transition from gas - liquid phase separation to arrested phase separation ( gelation ) as a function of polymer concentration .",
    "the phase separation dynamics become increasingly slow as the system is quenched more deeply .",
    "experimental phase diagrams show that as the attractive range increases , the region where phase separation is uninterrupted by gelation expands .",
    "in addition , the mechanism of domain growth is studied in detail .",
    "we find that upon quenching , coarsening occurs predominately through enhanced particle mobility at the surface of the strands of the gel network .",
    "our first model system consisted of a low polydispersity emulsion of poly(dimethyl siloxane ) ( silicone dc200 fluid 10cst , serva ) dispersed in a refractive index - matched mixed solvent of 1,2-ethane diol ( eg ) and water .",
    "the emulsion was stabilized against aggregation by a combination of three commercial non - ionic surfactants ( w / w ratio 1:0.417:0.015 ) ; tristyrylphenol ethoxylate , 16eo ( tanatex ) , peo - ppo - peo , @xmath16 4950 , 30% peo ( pluronic p103 , basf ) and to give a small negative charge , the anionic surfactant sodium bis(2-ethyl 1-hexyl ) sulfosuccinate ( aerosol ot , cytec ) . small droplets ( pdms : surfactant 1:0.12 ) had a hydrodynamic radius @xmath17 nm and a size polydispersity of 0.10 , while large droplets ( pdms : surfactant 1:0.05 ) had a hydrodynamic radius @xmath18 nm and a size polydispersity of 0.18 .",
    "the index - matched continuous phase had a viscosity of 5.42 mpa s @xmath19 0.02 mpa s , as measured by capillary viscometry , a refractive index of 1.396 at 543 nm , and a density of @xmath20 g @xmath21 0.005 g @xmath22 .",
    "the density of the pdms oil is lower than the continuous phase ( @xmath23 g @xmath24 g @xmath22 ) so that the dispersions cream in a gravitational field .",
    "the density mismatch of the oil is @xmath25 0.01 g @xmath22 . to screen out long - range electrostatic interactions and generate hard - sphere - like interactions between the emulsion drops we add 3 mm potassium chloride , which gives a debye length of 6 nm .",
    "a dye , sudan black , was also added to increase contrast between colloid - rich and colloid - poor phases such that the phase separation could be identified by eye .",
    "sudan black preferentially adsorbs to the surface of the pdms droplets , and so the colloid - rich phase appears dark and the colloid - poor phase light .",
    "hydroxyethylcellulose ( hec ) , which is a water - soluble non - ionic cellulose derivative , was used as the depletant .",
    "two molecular weights , of hydroxyethylcellulose were employed : natrosol 250 m and natrosol 250 hhx ( ashland - aqualon ) , with molecular weights of @xmath26 g mol@xmath27 and @xmath28 g mol@xmath27 respectively .",
    "their estimated radii of gyration @xmath29 are 92 nm for natrosol 250 m and 126 nm for natrosol 250 hhx , as obtained by static light scattering .",
    "small droplets combined with natrosol hhx gives a polymer - colloid size ratio , @xmath30 , of 0.89 ; small droplets with natrosol m gives @xmath31 ; finally , large droplets with natrosol hhx gives @xmath32 .",
    "samples were prepared by first diluting a stock solution of the polymer with solvent , ensuring proper dispersion of the polymer .",
    "then , solvent containing fluorescent rhodamine - b dye ( sigma aldrich ) was added such that the concentration of rhodamine - b was 0.02 gl@xmath27 in the aqueous phase for all samples .",
    "finally , stock emulsion was added and the sample gently stirred for at least ten minutes before being quickly transferred to the imaging cell .",
    "the start of the experiment ( @xmath33 ) was taken as the instant when stirring ceased .      for our second system , we used poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) core - shell particles@xcite , sterically stabilised with poly(12-hydroxy stearic acid ) ( phsa ) , with a mean radius 416 nm and a polydispersity of 0.10 , as determined by scanning electron microscopy .",
    "both the core and shell were labeled with fluorescent dyes : the core with coumarin and the shell with rhodamine - b .",
    "the particles were suspended in a density - matched 78/22 ( % w / w ) mixture of cyclohexyl bromide and cis - decalin .",
    "4 mm of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide was dissolved in the solvent mixture to screen electrostatic interactions and ensure hard - sphere - like behaviour of the colloids .",
    "depletion attractions were induced by addition of polystyrene ( ps ) as a non - adsorbing polymer . the polymer molecular weight was @xmath34 g mol@xmath27 .",
    "we estimate the polymer radius of gyration , @xmath35 , to be 203 nm@xcite , such that the polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath36 was 0.49 , which was comparable to that of the smallest size ratio in the emulsion droplet system .",
    "confocal microscopy was used to study the temporal evolution of the bicontinuous network formed in our aqueous emulsion samples .",
    "a supporting frame was constructed to allow a light microscope ( zeiss , axioskop s100 ) fitted with a confocal scanning head ( zeiss , lsm pascal ) to be mounted horizontally . a laser wavelength of 532  nm was used to excite rhodamine molecules dissolved in the solvent , such that the background appears light and the emulsion droplets dark .",
    "for clarity , we have inverted the micrographs pertaining to system i so that the colloid - rich phase appears bright and the colloid - poor phase dark .",
    "emulsion - polymer dispersions ( system i ) were studied in large rectangular glass cuvettes with the front wall of the cell constructed from a 170 @xmath37 m thick optical quality cover glass .",
    "the sealed cuvette had a square cross - section with an internal dimension of 13 mm , a height of 30 mm , and contained a small hole at the top of the cell through which the cell was filled .    for pmma samples",
    "( system ii ) , a conventionally mounted confocal microscope ( leica sp5 with resonant scanner ) was used to image in the @xmath38-plane and a laser with wavelength 488  nm was used to excite fluorescence from the coumarin - labelled core of the particles .",
    "2d images were collected at time intervals of @xmath39150 - 300 milliseconds over a total time period of 10 - 20 seconds , with typically 100 - 400 particles in each frame .",
    "data was averaged over 10 - 20 runs in order to improve statistics .      to study the structural evolution quantitatively , length scales characteristic of the gel structure were extracted from the 2d - confocal images . for an image of width @xmath40 taken at time @xmath41 , we calculated the radially - averaged structure factor @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the 2d fourier transform ( ft ) of the image intensity @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the 2d fourier transform displays a ring of high intensity at low @xmath47 which signifies the presence of a large characteristic length scale .",
    "we characterise the dominant wavevector by the first moment @xmath48 of the structure factor , where    @xmath49    with limits @xmath50 @xmath37m@xmath27 and @xmath51 @xmath37m@xmath27 .",
    "the dominant wavevector was then converted into a characteristic size @xmath52 .    in the pmma system ,",
    "the motion of the colloidal particles was tracked using modified versions of standard tracking routines@xcite .",
    "particles were separated into two groups : we define surface particles as those with @xmath53 neighbours throughout the image set , and bulk particles as ones with @xmath54 .    in order for timescales to be compared directly in systems with different particle sizes and solvent viscosities , we quote all times in units of the characteristic brownian time @xmath55 , which is comparable to the time taken for a particle to diffuse its own radius in a solvent of viscosity @xmath56 . for the pdms emulsion system ,",
    "the long time viscosity @xmath56 of the continuous phase was determined from the diffusion constant of particles of known radius suspended in hec solutions , using dynamic light scattering .",
    "viscosities @xmath56 were deduced from the measured diffusion constant using the stokes - einstein equation @xmath57 .",
    "the concentration dependence of the viscosity was then fitted to the martin equation @xcite , @xmath58\\cp\\exp(k_{\\textrm{h}}[\\eta]\\cp)$ ] , where @xmath56 is the limiting low shear viscosity , @xmath59 is the solvent viscosity , @xmath60 $ ] is the intrinsic viscosity and @xmath61 is the huggins constant .",

    "the estimated brownian times @xmath63 were between 0.1 s and 1.1 s , depending on the particle size , polymer molecular weight and polymer concentration . in the pmma system , the brownian time was determined as @xmath64 s.      experimental phase diagrams at size ratios @xmath32 and @xmath65 were constructed for system i. the overall colloid volume fraction in each sample was fixed at @xmath66 for all samples , and polymer concentration @xmath67 and hence quench depth was varied , such that all state points lie on a vertical line through the phase diagram .",
    "phase diagrams were obtained by allowing emulsion droplet samples shallowly quenched into the two - phase region to fully equilibrate , then measuring the colloid volume fraction in both phases using uv - visible spectroscopy to measure absorbance of sudan black at 600 nm , which was proportional to the droplet concentration .",
    "[ figuvvisphasediagram ] shows the phase diagrams we obtained .",

    "as the time taken to equilibrate increases rapidly with polymer concentration , only shallow quenches were experimentally accessible for this method and we note that underestimation of the colloidal volume fraction of the colloid - rich phase can not be ruled out .",
    "although the polymer concentrations used here are less than those used for the confocal experiments , extrapolations are sketched to show that the in the case of the smaller @xmath47 , colloid - rich phase becomes dense with relatively shallow quenches after the coexistence line is crossed .",
    "in contrast , the dense branch of the long - range system requires much deeper quenches to achieve comparable volume fraction .",

    "now the phase boundary for @xmath31 in units of gl@xmath27 does not lie between those corresponding @xmath32 and @xmath65 .",

    "we have presented an experimental study of dynamics in phase - separating colloid - polymer mixtures with interaction range between 0.45 and 0.89 .",
    "our data suggest that the crossover from phase separation to gelation is a continuous process as function of polymer concentration , with phase separation dynamics slowing gradually until arrest is reached .",

    "we find the dynamics of phase separation couple to the structural relaxation at the particle level in the colloid - rich phase upon deep quenches where slow dynamics set in . at weaker quenches , the phase separation dynamics decouple from the single - particle dynamics , and in this way we distinguish two modes of phase separation - ` normal ' and ` viscoelastic ' .",

    "<S> we present a real - space study of dynamics in phase separating colloid - polymer mixtures with medium- to long - range attractions ( polymer - colloid size ratio @xmath0 ) , with the aim of understanding the mechanism of gelation as the range of the attraction is changed . in contrast to previous studies of short - range attractive systems , where gelation occurs shortly after crossing the equilibrium phase boundary , we find a substantial region of fluid - fluid phase separation . on deeper quenches the system undergoes a continuous crossover to gel formation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two regimes , ` classical ' phase separation , where single particle relaxation is faster than the dynamics of phase separation , and ` viscoelastic ' phase separation , where demixing is slowed down appreciably due to slow dynamics in the colloid - rich phase . </S>",
    "<S> particles at the surface of the strands of the network exhibit significantly greater mobility than those buried inside the gel strand which presents a method for coarsening . </S>"
