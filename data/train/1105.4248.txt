    "with an increasing number of experiments bringing mesoscopic oscillators to the quantum regime , it has become essential to develop efficient readout methods that are able to verify quantum effects in such systems .",
    "the ultimate goal is the full reconstruction of the system s density matrix .",
    "most of the current schemes to measure nanomechanical motion consist of weak continuous measurements of the oscillator s position ( see e.g. @xcite ) . even though these techniques are useful for the monitoring of ground state fluctuations , they are not easily applicable to arbitrary nonstationary states , where the relation between the quantum state and the measured data is extremely complicated .",
    "recently a method that allows full reconstruction of an arbitrary state of a mechanical oscillator has been proposed in the context of optomechanics @xcite , however it relies on tomography techniques that involve transformations of the measured data . in both cases it is challenging to identify an unknown quantum state with high accuracy .",
    "the idea that a two - level system ( or qubit ) could be used as a probe to reconstruct the quantum state of a continuous - variable system has been initially proposed in the field of cavity - qed , due to the impossibility to directly measure the intracavity field @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have subsequently been introduced in the field of circuit - qed @xcite , ion traps @xcite and nanomechanical oscillators @xcite . in all these works , information about the initial state of the oscillator is inferred from the transition probabilities of the qubit , after the two systems have interacted . typically , the value of the characteristic function @xcite of the oscillator at several phase space points can be directly extracted from the qubit statistics .    _ in this paper we report a further advance in this direction_. firstly , we assume to control the parametric coupling between the qubit and oscillator as a function of time , a very interesting possibility opened by some recent experimental and theoretical works @xcite . with this choice , any point of the oscillator s phase space can be reached by appropriately tailoring the time dependence of the coupling .",
    "the corresponding value of the characteristic function is then measured by combining the expectation values of two pauli operators of the qubit . differently from methods involving resonant interactions @xcite ,",
    "no auxiliary degrees of freedom or additional displacement operations are required in our scheme .",
    "the second contribution we give to the field is the full inclusion of decoherence in the treatment , since to the best of our knowledge the effect of noise on such state reconstruction procedures has yet to be explored systematically .",
    "the inclusion of decoherence is essential especially when dealing with mesoscopic systems , where the coupling of _ both _ the qubit and the oscillator to a thermal environment can not be neglected .",
    "when the environment is described via the standard markovian master equation , we obtain the remarkable result that the characteristic function can still be reconstructed in full detail . the price to pay",
    "is that a larger number of experimental runs will be needed to extract the same amount of information as compared to the ideal decoherence - free case . in practice ,",
    "decoherence will limit the size of the phase space region where the characteristic function can be measured in a reasonable number of runs .",
    "when only the nearbies of the origin can be accessed , our method still gives useful information by providing low order moments of the mechanical quadratures .",
    "as an addition we show , and examine , how well our system can be used to prepare superposition states of the oscillator in the presence of decoherence , and we provide a detailed analysis of the resulting characteristic function .",
    "having proposed a method to reconstruct the characteristic function , we remark that it constitutes a very useful description of a quantum state , even though it is sometimes overlooked in favor of the wigner representation @xcite .",
    "as we emphasize in this paper , a number of properties such as purity , squeezing or the presence of coherent superpositions can be investigated from it as directly as from the wigner function . since any moment of the mechanical quadratures can be extracted from it in a straightforward way , the characteristic function is the ideal representation to invesigate statistical properties such as squeezing or non - gaussianity @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an efficient method to estimate nonclassicality directly from a finite collection of measured characteristic function values has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "we consider a qubit with ground state @xmath0 , excited state @xmath1 , bare energy @xmath2 and tunneling energy @xmath3 , coupled to a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath5 is for now a generic function of time .",
    "the hamiltonian , in units of @xmath6 , is @xmath7 where the pauli matrices are @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the harmonic oscillator . in a later section",
    "we will come back to some possible experimental realizations of such time - varying coupling .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we will consider the parametric coupling regime @xmath10 . in an interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonian",

    "remarkably , this is still a valid representation of the state @xmath24 , since the functional @xmath45 does not depend on the state of the oscillator and it is fully known in our theory once the coupling @xmath5 is assigned @xcite .",
    "the actual value of the characteristic function can thus be recovered _ even in the presence of finite decoherence_. this however requires that we measure the expectation values in ( [ main - result ] ) with an accuracy greater than @xmath46 .",
    "assuming that the relative error on @xmath47 scales as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of experimental runs , @xmath50 is needed to measure the value of the characteristic function at the point @xmath35 with sufficient accuracy .",
    "as we will see , @xmath36 tends to increase as @xmath51 is increased , meaning that decoherence imposes practical limits to our `` reach '' in phase space .",
    "an essential step of the reconstruction protocol is the inversion of eq .",

    "the realization of such inversion is clearly not unique and the specific form of @xmath5 and the choice of the interaction time can be optimized to best suit the available experimental apparatus . to give a concrete example",
