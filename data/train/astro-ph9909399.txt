    "in the search for high energy astrophysical  sources , be it with earth - bound experiments or with satellite borne detectors , the test on an integral ( dc ) excess of event numbers from the direction of a source , compared to an adequately derived background expectation , is certainly the major statistical tool .",
    "( for a quite general consideration of this topic , see li&ma @xcite ) . however , an integral excess of events is not the only characteristic one might be interested in .",
    "many  sources are known to exhibit highly variable fluxes .    in this paper a newly developed test on variability for photon counting experiments is presented .",
    "in contrast to time series analyses , in which sampled continuous functions are examined and which are applied e.g.  in optical astronomy , this test deals with discrete registration times of single events , i.e.  _ point process data_. this situation is typically encountered in  astronomy .",
    "it is dedicated to two basic , different , but closely related questions that require statistical methods :    * are there significant signals of variability from a certain celestial position even if there is only a moderate or hardly significant dc excess from that direction , if the observation is limited by background fluctuations ? * how well is the sequence of arrival times of pure ( or almost pure ) events from a well - known source described by a constant flux ?    considering the case of known or assumed periodicities of activity of the objects in question ,",
    "several statistical tests are established to search for fixed frequencies in point process data ( see e.g.  mardia @xcite , lewis @xcite ) .    for the remaining case of irregular temporal activity schemes , the situation concerning established tests",
    "is less satisfying .",
    "in many publications , more or less spontaneously invented measures of variability are used , based mostly on a procedure of binning the event data in equally sized time slices and subsequent application of a @xmath0 test .",
    "based on this idea , some rather elaborated tests have been worked out , binning the data into a lot of different ways under variation of bin phases and widths ( e.g.  collura etal .",
    "@xcite , biller etal .",
    "the measure of variability is then obtained by a certain combination of all single @xmath0 test results .",
    "such tests typically suffer from two deficiencies :    * the chance probability for a given probe can in general only be assessed by  means , since the single @xmath0 test results are not independent * the computation of the measure itself is quite expensive expressed in terms of computing time and storage needs since the data has to be divided into a lot of different binning schemes    other drawbacks in certain situations are the restriction of those tests to sufficiently high event statistics , and the fact that the rigorous employment of simultaneously acquired background events to account for a non - uniform temporal acceptance of a detector is not obvious . in addition , the procedures are by far too complicated to apply them to a huge number of different potential source directions , e.g.  using them for a kind of all - sky search for variable sources .",
    "it should not be concealed that there exist alternative variability analysis procedures for point process data ( see e.g. scargle @xcite or gregory&loredo @xcite for an application of bayesian methods ) .",
    "these are surely appropriate to attack  higher order questions \" such as typical time scales of variability or change points of fluxes , but the application is at least as complicated as the use of binned tests .",
    "these difficulties may well bring down the willingness of experimenters to apply those tests .",
    "the unbinned _ exp - test _ that will be introduced in the following is , in contrast to the tests mentioned above , easy to apply , using a straightforward , natural measure for variability .",
    "the result of it will therefore not be as specific as for most of the above tests , but will supply a measure for variability in general .",
    "it should be emphasized that one established test of this kind is already existing : the nonparametric kolmogorov test , applied to the cumulated distribution function ( cdf ) of the registration times of the events in question , comparing them to the expected equal distribution . in opposition to it",
    ", the exp - test will have a more differential character , thus complementing the kolmogorov test in a sense that will be specified later .",
    "although described here in the context of time variability analysis , the application of the exp - test is not restricted to the time domain , but may be used in the analysis of e.g.  spatial or frequency data as well .",
    "it might also be found useful in other disciplines of science where the analysis of empirical data plays a role , like biology , economics and engineering .    in the following section",
    ", the exp - test is developed for the ideal situation of a uniform or exactly known temporal acceptance function of the experiment with respect to the events from a potential source .",
    "section 3 deals with the generalization needed to apply the exp - test with simultaneously registered background events , while in section 4 the sensitivity of the test is characterized . in section 5 , a brief comparison with the kolmogorov test is carried out , and in the last section a summary is given .",
    "supposed a uniform temporal acceptance of the used detector is given , the expected temporal sequence of registered events in absence of a variable source is governed by poisson statistics .",
    "this applies to both background events and events from a steady source , thereby defining the zero hypothesis for _ any _ test on variability in this context .",
    "one starts with the poisson distribution p_(n ) = e^- [ poisson ] where @xmath1 denotes the expectation value .",
    "+ a monotone sequence @xmath2 of events in time @xmath3 is called a _ poisson process _ , if there exists a constant @xmath4 , such that for all @xmath5 , dividing the time in equally sized intervals of the length @xmath6 , the numbers of events per time interval are poisson distributed with @xmath7 and mutually independent ( see e.g.  chatfield @xcite ) . from this immediately follows the probability density function ( pdf ) of the time intervals @xmath6 between two consecutive events as the derivative of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath6 @xmath9 i.e. an exponential distribution in @xmath6 with the mean value @xmath4 .",
    "+ let there now be a randomly chosen time interval , containing the monotonically increasing sequence of event times @xmath10 .",
    "let the resulting distribution t_i_i=1  n : = ( t_i+1-t_i)_i=1  n have a mean value @xmath11 .",
    "if one sets @xmath12 in  ( i.e.  setting @xmath4 to the actually obtained mean value ) , it follows for the @xmath13 to stem from a distribution @xmath14 , under the constraint of the conserved mean value .",
    "this is generally valid , even for _ a priori _ unlikely values of @xmath15 , because the @xmath16 are completely uncorrelated .",
    "this ensures that any analysis based only on @xmath15 is independent of a possibly present dc excess or deficit .",
    "now the distribution of the @xmath13 can be compared with @xmath14 using a distribution test .",
    "the classical tests ( e.g.  kolmogorov test or smirnov  cramr  von - mises test ) are neither well suited to measure exactly the effect that is searched for , nor is it possible to take the constraint of the conserved mean value into account .",
    "for this reason a natural measure will be introduced here that is especially sensitive to excesses of the @xmath13 far from the mean value .    defining the pdf @xmath17 of the random probe ( t):= _ i=1^n ( t - t_i ) the equalities of the 0 .  and 1 .",
    "momenta of @xmath18 and @xmath19 serve as a starting point : @xmath20 the variance of the distribution @xmath17 could be used as a measure for event clusters ( and corresponding dilutions ) , but this quantity is too sensitive on very large @xmath13 due to the extreme assymmetry of the exponential distribution .",
    "( actually the value of the variance is dominated by the pdf between @xmath15 and @xmath21 , although only 37% of the @xmath13 are contained in that interval . ) in order to be not too sensitive to outliers , another way will be followed . from eqs.[poismom1],[poismom2 ] follows @xmath22 defining now ( x ) : = _ 0^x",

    "( the transition from @xmath4 , i.e.  the expected value , to @xmath15 , the actual mean value of the random probe , slightly reduces this value .",
    "this fact will be investigated later . )",
    "hence one has @xmath28 being a functional on the set of all pdf defined on @xmath29 , with the property @xmath30 .",
    "provided @xmath15 is already computed , @xmath31 can be calculated from the pdf of the @xmath13 between @xmath32 and @xmath15 alone .",
    "it will be higher than expected if untypical excesses of small @xmath13 are present ( i.e.  in the case of burst - like phenomena ) , and lower than expected for untypical excesses of @xmath13 near @xmath15 ( i.e.  for untypically regular temporal structures compared to the average poisson process ) .",
    "fixing the extreme cases    1 .",

    "it can be noted for any pdf on @xmath29 with a mean value of @xmath15 : ( ) [ 0,1 [    from the above it can be concluded that @xmath31 defines a well - behaved and natural measure of variability , therefore @xmath31 is chosen to be the measure of the exp - test .",
    "it should be stressed that only the spectrum of time intervals _ between _ two consecutive events is entering , thus giving this test a rather differential character .    it remains the derivation of the actual distribution function for the @xmath38 for given @xmath39 ( in the following denoted @xmath40 distribution ) under the zero hypothesis . in any case , this pdf is independent on the particular value of @xmath15 , since this constant only scales the time , whereas @xmath31 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "analytically exact solutions are    surely possible but not attempted here , because a considerable expenditure has to be expected . instead",
    ", a semi - analytical approach is followed , using the fact that all spreads occuring here are resulting from spreads in the polynomial distribution , all of them scaling with @xmath41 , thus leading for dimensionless variables such as @xmath31 to asymptotic standard deviations @xmath42 . for a similar reason ,",
    "the difference of the mean value @xmath43 and @xmath27 will be , again at least asymtotically , proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore it can be expected , according to the central limit theorem of statistics , that for increasing @xmath39 the distribution as a whole will tend towards a normal distribution .",
    "therefore only two constants @xmath45 need to be determined , for which the following asymptotic scaling laws apply : - ( _",
    "n ) = ( _ n ) = [ abdef ] in simulations of poisson processes by generating time sequences with the help of a pseudo random number generator , there could not be found any significant deviations from for @xmath39 ranging between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( using @xmath48 individually generated sequences per considered number of @xmath39 , see ) . with weighted means of the obtained values",
    ", @xmath45 could be constrained to = 0.189 0.004 = 0.2427 0.0002 [ albeta ] there is only one faint ( but significant ) deviation from the @xmath41 scaling law of the spread at @xmath49 ( the actually obtained number there is @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , the use of the scaling law at @xmath49 thus corresponds to an error of @xmath51 on a significance scale , which is negligible in almost all cases .",
    "after having determined the mean values and the standard deviations with sufficiently high precision for most purposes , only the shape of the @xmath40 distribution has to be compared to that of a normal distribution @xmath52 with the same mean and variance . in  the generated relative event frequencies",
    "are compared to @xmath52-distributed probabilities , for examples of @xmath53 . due to the fact that @xmath54 is not in the middle of the allowed interval ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath40 , a faint positive skewness of the @xmath40 distribution can be noticed for smaller @xmath39 .",
    "the peculiar drop of frequencies towards larger negative significances for @xmath49 results from this , too , since @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "such an effect is already hardly noticeable for @xmath58 .",
    "one notes that already for @xmath49 and moderate positive deviations from the expectation value ( @xmath59 ) the actual @xmath40 distribution follows the normal distribution with a good precision , whereas for @xmath60 the approximation with the normal distribution is globally valid for most practical cases .",
    "so only for extremely high precision requirements individual  calculations are necessary to assess the exact significance of an effect .",
    "the exp - test as developed so far can be readily applied in data analyses of experiments that have a sufficiently constant temporal acceptance . in the case of a varying acceptance function",
    "is not valid , as one can not expect a poisson process any longer .",
    "( this case is sometimes referred to as _ inhomogenous poisson process _ , see chatfield @xcite . )",
    "if the temporal acceptance is discretely switched on and off , the problem can be easily solved by excluding the time intervals during which the data aquisition was actually switched off or blocked ( e.g.  due to electronics dead time ) . in the general case ( continuously varying acceptance @xmath61 , which is the typical case in earth - bound @xmath62-ray experiments ) , the variable @xmath3 has to be replaced by a scaled effective time @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , in order to apply the exp - test as defined above , but this would require a precise and complete knowledge of the temporal acceptance function .",
    "however , a simple reasoning shows that background event times @xmath65 ( being from a poisson process in @xmath63 as well ) , simultaneously collected with the event times @xmath2 of interest , could serve the same purpose if the background has a sufficiently high temporal density ( e.g. , in the case of cosmic rays , if the background events stem from a solid angle which is large compared to the one that defines the  on - source \" events ) . in this case no explicit knowledge about @xmath61 is required any longer . instead , one can use the distribution of the @xmath66 between two consecutive on - source events directly , thus testing , so to speak , whether the two distributions are mutually poisson distributed .    proceeding for this purpose from the pdf of the generalized time intervals @xmath67 ( see ) between two on - source events ( the actual acceptance function @xmath61 does not play a role in the end ; the only exploited feature is that it scales the on - source and the background distributions simultaneously ) : f _ ( ) = ( - ) [ aexpdis ] with a certain , fixed @xmath68 . +",
    "now let the background events be from a poisson process as well , with an expectation value @xmath69 in a generalized time interval @xmath70 of @xmath71 from  follows the distribution of the _ mean values _ for the number of background events between two on - source events : f ( _ ) = ( - ) [ lambdis ] ( with a global expectation value of @xmath72 ) + the complete pdf for the _ number of background events between two consecutive on - source events _ ( in the following called  inter - events \" ) can be derived now as a weighted ( with @xmath73 ) integration of the poisson distribution @xmath74 ( see ) over @xmath69 : @xmath75 i.e.  a discrete exponential distribution . expressed with the help of the exponential function one yields w_c(n ) = ( -(1 + ) n ) [ wne ] ( compare  ) .",
    "thus the number of background events can be used as a substitute for a generalized clock ( measuring @xmath63 intervals ) .",
    "the precision of this  clock \" will be defined by @xmath4 ( i.  e.  the ratio of the number of background events to the number of time intervals to test , or , equivalent , the mean value of all inter - events ) .",

    "0(c^ ) - _ c^(n ) = _ c^(n ) = [ abdefd ] then empirically the following parametrization can be found : @xmath86 ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 from ) + the least squares fit that leads to @xmath89 and @xmath90 is shown in    ( left ) . since the spreads can by far more accurately be assessed than the mean values , again the fit to them provides the more precise numbers .",
    "however , in  ( right ) it can be seen that the dependency of @xmath91 on @xmath15 is compatible with the same parametrization , so that the same functional behaviour may well be assumed .",
    "summarizing , it can be stated for the discrete case that was considered here , that the @xmath83 distribution equals approximately a normal distribution @xmath92 , with only small deviations similar to the ones shown in .",
    "for @xmath93 the distribution of @xmath83 tends in all aspects towards the @xmath40 distribution .",
    "since decreasing @xmath15 lead to increasing spreads @xmath94 , for optimization of the sensitivity @xmath15 should be chosen as large as possible .    as a last general remark that applies to the continuous case as well as to the discrete case",
    "it should be stressed that the measure of the exp - test @xmath38 or @xmath82 can be assessed with running sums when one allows for two sequential passes over the data : in the first pass , @xmath15 can be determined , whereas in the second pass the sum in  or  can be calculated .",
    "this possibility is a major advantage in comparison to binned procedures .",
    "this section deals with an application of the exp - test in a general scenario , in order to characterize its sensitivity .    consider the case of a sporadically active source with a duty cycle @xmath950,1]$ ] , during which it  pollutes \" the undisturbed background with additional events from another poisson process ( i.e. , the constellation of the first question mentioned in the introduction ) .",
    "let the total number of registered events be @xmath39 , the number of background events be @xmath96 , and the number of additional events from the source be @xmath97 ( i.e.   @xmath98 ) .",
    "without loss of generality , the total observation time is set to @xmath99 ( see sketch in ) .",
    "the same pattern applies to the case of undiluted source events in a search for a signal of variablility ( second question posed in the introduction ) , in which case @xmath96 denotes the quiescent flux @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponds to the flux @xmath102 during the active state of an object .    to begin with the consideration of the continuous @xmath40 statistics , it follows for the pdf @xmath103 of @xmath6 to be @xmath104 ( i.e. , according to , @xmath105 , without loss of generality ) + from  it follows an expectation value for @xmath106 of ( ) = ( ) ( 1 - q + q(- ) ) [ t0cexp ] it is important to note that , due to the differential nature of the test , @xmath107 and consequently @xmath108 apply not only to a flux pattern as shown in , but to _ all _ two - leveled light curves .",

    "question , one will ask for the _ significance _ of the exp - test result in comparison to the significance of a dc excess . for the exp - test , a significance @xmath109 of . in any case of real random probes with finite @xmath39",

    "it should be emphasized once again that both significances are perfectly independent if the zero hypothesis is true .",
    "obeying the limit from above and defining @xmath118 , for @xmath119 it follows from that s= ( 1- ) s[clin ] while for @xmath120 one obtains s|_q = q = s|_q=0 i.e.  in the case of moderate dc significances , only for @xmath121 a significance from the exp - test that is worth mentioning can be expected . in the context of the first question ,",
    "the exp - test therefore should be regarded as a test on burst - like temporal structures .    in the case of the discrete @xmath83 statistics ,",
    "qualitatively the same signature for the considered scenario occurs .",

    "defining @xmath129 , one gets from : @xmath130 in the resulting expectations for the significances are displayed as contour lines in the @xmath112-@xmath131 plane .    making use of the fact that the the assumed two - level model is most efficient to produce an effect on @xmath106 with respect to an upper limit of the ratio of maximum to minimum flux levels present for a given source , for a sufficiently high significance @xmath109 it is immediately possible to deduce a _ lower limit _ of actual flux variations @xmath132 for a source . for the given example values of @xmath109",

    "in order to recognize the strengthes of the exp - test on the one hand and the kolmogorov test on the other , the latter shall be briefly reviewed here .",
    "the kolmogorov test uses the maximum @xmath134 of the absolute differences of the cdf @xmath135 of the temporal distribution of the event sequence and the expected cdf @xmath136 ( i.e.  an equal distribution in the case of uniform temporal acceptance ) : d:= | g(t)-g(t)| being @xmath39 the total number of events , it can be shown that the chance probabilities @xmath137 in dependence from @xmath134 under the zero hypothesis are asymptotically distributed according to kolmogorovs @xmath1 distribution : p(d > ) 2 _ k=1^(-1)^k+1e^-2k^2 ^ 2 [ gkolmo ] ( kolmogorov @xcite ) .",

    "is reduced by @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "nonetheless ,  may serve as a rough estimate for all practical purposes .",
    "it is obvious that for splitted activity intervals @xmath149 will be much lower . in a comparison with the exp - test ( see ) therefore it has to be stated that for _ one single outburst _ of a source with @xmath153 the expected significances from the kolmogorov test and from the exp - test are similar ( but slightly higher from the latter ) , while for a comparably long and uninterrupted activity interval the kolmogorov test is more sensitive , whereas the exp - test is better suited to find some or many short outbursts .",
    "finally , the correlation of both tests under the zero hypothesis has to be studied .",

    "one concludes that it is worth to apply both tests in a search of variable sources , maybe except for _ very small _ event numbers .",
    "it should be mentioned that , like for the exp - test , the result of the kolmogorov test is completely independent from the dc test result if the zero hypothesis is valid .",
    "furthermore , the application of smirnovs variant ( smirnov @xcite ) allows for the use of simultaneously acquired background events to define the zero hypothesis in the case of nonuniform temporal acceptance . just like for the exp - test",
    ", the kolmogorov test result can also be determined from runnig sums during two sequential passes over the experimental data .",

    "the significances from the exp - test are expected to be @xmath161 times higher than the dc significances .",
    "the direct use of background events acquired simultaneously matches perfectly the requirements of typical experiments in the earthbound @xmath62-ray astronomy .    asking for signals of variability in pure source events , the result of the exp - test represents a simple and broad - banded measure for deviations from a constant flux .",
    "a positive result of the exp - test in such situations supplies an immediate information about the minimum flux variations @xmath132 present in the sample .",
    "the results from the exp - test are by construction independent from a dc excess or deficit , and unaffected by interrupts of the activity cycle as far as possible .",
    "the test can be applied as soon as the number @xmath39 of events to test surmounts @xmath162 .",
    "although every test on variability contains arbitrary elements , special care was taken to find a nonartificial measure that is suggested by itself when studying the elementary statistics of poisson processes .",
    "from the viewpoint of the author , the exp - test fulfills this criterion ."
