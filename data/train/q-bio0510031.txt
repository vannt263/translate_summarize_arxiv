    "ecological , and in general biological , systems dynamics are often governed with nonlinear interactions of environmental factors .",
    "environmental variables interact with systems in such a complex way that the whole system achieves a broader functionality that can not be deduced by considering individual environmental factors .",
    "the goal of the ecological studies has been to gain insight into this functionality and complexity by observing individual factors affecting the system in question .",
    "system dynamics , and the influence of individual factors to these dynamics as a whole , has been of primary concern not only for theoretical considerations , but also management and conservation practices .",
    "one natural choice to achieve this purpose is to abstract the system and interactions inherent in it by mathematical and statistical models .",
    "ecological modeling studies have traditionally been concentrated on the use of  \" box - and - arrow  \" type differential / difference equation models @xcite . however , while these models provide valuable insight into the particular ecosystem being studied , because of their strong dependence on the parameters specific to that system , these models are prone to be criticized as being  \" case - specific  \" . to achieve generalizability and thus to gain insight into the ecosystems in general ,",
    "statistical models have been one of the main practices ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is especially true for statistical classification and pattern recognition models which fundamentally aim to characterize a combination of variables and their measurements which lead to particular state(s ) of the ecosystem .    on the other hand , traditional classification , and in general statistical ,",
    "models require strong assumptions about the distribution of the underlying observations and/or the system characteristics @xcite . to overcome this issue , nonlinear and/or non - parametric models to model ecosystems on the basis of finite - size observations",
    "have become recently popular .",
    "of particular importance in this respect is the use of connectionist artificial neural network - based approaches such as generalized linear models and feedforward multilayer backpropagation networks .",
    "these models are able to capture the nonlinear interactions and complexity of the ecosystem without the need for any assumptions about the distribution of the observations .",
    "however , the main problem associated with these approaches has been their  \" off - line ",
    "\" iterative nature @xcite and the computational costs associated with these models , compared to traditional approaches @xcite .",
    "the latter problem can be overcome by considering the use of simpler models where they attain a fairly good performance .",
    "the former problem , on the other hand , being off - line , constitutes to the main issue , especially for management practices .",
    "each time a new observation is made , these models require to be retrained on the entire data set in order to include the new observation . considering the computational cost associated with artificial neural network based approaches",
    ", this fact renders these models less practical from a management point of view .",
    "however , though unfamiliar to ecological and biological modelers , several other families of neural network models have been developed since the early 70 s , including art and artmap family of models @xcite .",
    "these unsupervised and pseudo - supervised , self organizing maps have the advantage of being real - time models , and thus being able to incorporate new observations easily .",
    "in addition , the computational costs associated with art - family of models are comparably small compared to connectionist neural network models , while their performance is reasonably better .    to assess the performance of a model , several studies showed the importance of independent test sets @xcite .",
    "although a given model , particularly neural networks @xcite , can perform arbitrarily well on training data set , the actual goal for statistical models is to achieve a high generalizability at the same time . from this point of view",
    ", a given model should minimize the training error and at the same time maximize the generalizability ( so - called minimax problem ) . in that respect , while connectionist neural network schemes are  \" universal approximators  \" of the training data set @xcite , there has been several techniques developed to maximize the predictive performance of a given model simultaneously on both training and test sets , such as cross - validation @xcite .",
    "recently , as mentioned before , the use of statistical techniques gained popularity to explain and predict the outcome of ecosystem processes , such as occurrence of multiple stable states @xcite , and habitat selection or distribution of species @xcite .",
    "predictive modeling attempts in ecology have used several methods ranging from regression @xcite to discriminant analysis @xcite , and from generalized additive @xcite and linear models @xcite to multilayer feedforward backpropagation networks @xcite and time series analysis @xcite . however , considering above mentioned arguments , it is necessary to assess predictive statistical models and algorithms in terms of their performance on and suitability for a given ecological problem , which to our knowledge , has not been done yet .",
    "although there are extensive studies aiming to compare statistical models for artificial data sets ( e.g. statlog project ; @xcite ) , it is obvious that the ecological data differs considerably than artificial data sets since former data is considerably more prone to observational and/or measurement noise , and the ecological interactions are inherently more complex and nonlinear .",
    "in addition , while all the variables and factors leading to system dynamics in artificial systems can be known and/or controlled , such is not true for the ecological systems . as such , a comparative study to asses the performance and at the same time suitability of statistical modeling techniques",
    "is required for the ecological modeling studies to avoid blind applications and ill allocation of time and effort .",
    "our aim is here to provide an overview for nature of the wide range of the data sets and predictive variables and their use in predictive ecological models by comparing different statistical modeling approaches . to that end , we studied 6 different data sets from both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems using 6 different type of statistical models .",
    "the models included traditional methods ( k - nearest neighbor : k - nn , and linear and quadratic discriminant analysis : lda and qda ) , connectionist neural network - type models ( generalized linear models : glm , feedforward multilayer backpropagation networks ) and pseudo - supervised artmap .",
    "some of these data sets used in this paper were modeled before using one or more of the particular algorithms and discussed extensively in several publications @xcite and as such , only a broad summary of these data sets are provided among with the relevant citations .",
    "lake eymir is a small shallow lake located in central anatolia . the upstream lake mogan empties into lake eymir at the southwest corner , forming the main inflow @xcite .",
    "data used in the model for lake eymir and lake mogan were collected between 1997 and 2002 @xcite .",
    "a total of 91 data points from lake eymir were used for fitting the models and the a total of 43 data points from the upstream lake mogan were used as an independent test set after fitting the models , to determine ability of the models to generalize .",
    "concentrations of total phosphorus ( tp , @xmath5gl@xmath6 ) , suspended solids ( ss , mg l@xmath6 ) , and chlorophyll - a ( chl - a , @xmath5gl@xmath6 ) , secchi disk transparency ( secchi , cm ) and water levels ( wl , meter above sea level ) were used as predictive ( independent ) variables .",
    "dependent variable was a binary index of submerged plant occurrence .",
    "it was suggested that the impacts of submerged plants become apparent on ecology of shallow lakes when both the plant volume infested ( pvi% , @xcite and the coverage exceeded 30% @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the dichotomous dependent variable was thus    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the binary index to show presence / absence of submerged vegetation ; ( 0 : absent ; 1 : present ) ; @xmath9 $ ] is the plant cover and @xmath10 $ ] is the pvi .",
    "detailed description of the study sites , data collection as well as a through discussion of the ecological state of these lakes are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "data comes from five lakes ( lakes beyehir , iikli , marmara , mogan and uluabat ) , which vary in size and depth and are located from southern to northern anatolia , turkey .",
    "these lakes were selected to model the impacts of fish biomass , hydrology and morphology on submerged plant development .",
    "data used to fit ( equivalently to train ) and test the models span several years , ranging from 19 years as in the case of beyehir to only two years as in the case of lake mogan .",
    "a total of 541 data points for all the lakes were obtained from the literature and pooled together for fitting the models .",
    "pooled data were further randomly split to two sets of 440 and 101 data points which constitute our final training and test data , respectively .",
    "the validation test set was not included in the training , and was reserved for assessment of the model performance on an independent data set ( referred hereafter as validation data for set 2 ) . in addition , the data gathered from lake mogan , consisting of 24 data points , was not included either in the training data or in the validation data sets , and was reserved for a second test set to asses the generalizability of the fitted models .",
    "this set corresponds to a system spatially and temporally distinct from the data used to train the model ( referred hereafter as independent data for set 2 ) .",
    "models consisted of 5 predictive variables , which included the ratio of carp ( _ cyprinus carpio _ ) biomass to total fish biomass ( carp ratio ) , amplitude of the intra - annual water level fluctuation defined as the difference between yearly maximum and minimum water depth , morphology index , calculated for each lake as the monthly ratio @xmath11 averaged over whole period spanned by the data , where @xmath12 is the mean depth and @xmath13 is the maximum depth .",
    "last two predictive variables were the z - score of water level , and period index , which was simply a sine transformation of the julian date of the corresponding data point .",
    "occurrence of submerged plants , assessed by equation [ [ eq : glm : output ] ] was used as dependent variable . in some rare cases , where there were no available quantitative data about the submerged plant coverage and/or volume in the lakes , but qualitative information",
    "is provided , we used the latter to designate the dichotomous dependent variable .    for a detailed description of the predictive and dependent variables ,",
    "readers are referred to @xcite . a detailed description of the study sites , data collection as well as a through discussion of the ecological states of these lakes are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "data are collected from two marshes in 1995 and 1996 , in sandusky bay on lake erie , ohio , usa and collected in 1969 and 1970 from other two located in connecticut , in the northeastern usa .",
    "the lake erie marshes were stubble patch and darr .",
    "data from these marshes included habitat variables and nest occurrence of red - winged blackbird ( _ agelaius phoeniceus _ ) @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the study sites and data can be found in @xcite .",
    "two marshes in connecticut were clarkes pond and all saints marsh .",
    "the data from these marshes included habitat information and breeding success of the same species @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the sites and data collection can be found in @xcite .",
    "we built two separate sets of models using different dependent variables : nest occurrence and breeding success models .",
    "the nest occurrence model was fit using 1995 data from the lake erie wetlands stubble patch and darr ( data set 3 ) .",
    "the predictive variables were vegetation durability based on an ordinate scale between 0 and 100 @xcite , stem density ( number of stems m@xmath14 ) , stem height ( cm above water ) , distance to open water ( m ) , distance to edge ( m ) , and water depth ( cm ) .",
    "the dependent variable was a binary index of nest occurrence .    in the breeding success model ,",
    "the predictive variables were vegetation durability based on an ordinate scale between 0 and 100 @xcite , nest height ( cm ) , distance to open water ( m ) , distance to edge ( m ) and water depth ( cm ) . a binary index of whether or not any nestling fledged was the dependent variable .",
    "data from clarkes pond collected in 1969 - 1970 is used for fitting the breeding success models ( data set 4 ) . in total 294 data points",
    "were available to fit the models .",
    "the final model was tested using the data from all saints marsh from 1969 ( @xmath15 ) and from 1970 ( @xmath16 ) as independent tests to assess the generalizability .",
    "trained models were also tested on the lake erie wetlands data from darr and stubble patch in 1995 and 1996 .",
    "similarly , nest occurrence models , trained on the lake erie data , were tested on the connecticut wetlands data from clarkes pond and all saints in 1969 and 1970 . because one set of the models were developed to predict breeding success and the other nest occurrence , for this research we assumed that a high probability of nest occurrence corresponds to a high probability of breeding success and vice versa .",
    "in addition , since the connecticut wetland variables did not include stem density , the average value of stem density from the lake erie wetlands was used when testing connecticut wetlands data on the lake erie model .",
    "note also that nest height was available for the connecticut wetlands while stem height was available for the lake erie wetlands , and these variables were used interchangeably .",
    "stem heights were about 50 cm higher than nest heights on average .",
    "the assumption was made that stem height and nest height were correlated .",
    "thus when the models were tested , nest heights were used as predictive variable instead of stem heights in the nest occurrence model and vice versa for the breeding success model .",
    "in addition to the nest occurrence data from darr and stubble patch , the information on breeding success from darr and stubble patch in 1996 together with the habitat variables of vegetation durability , nest height , distance to open water , distance to edge , and water depth under the nest was used as test data for the clarkes pond breeding success model .",
    "data set 5 collected in spring 2001 and spring 2002 in southeastern turkey to predict the presence or absence of breeding bird species depending on the environmental variables .",
    "the data gathered included three bird species : woodchat shrike ( _ lanius senator ; _ linnaeus , 1758 ) , short - toed lark ( _ calandrella brachydactyla ; _ leisler , 1814 ) , and olivaceous warbler ( _ hippolais pallida ; _ ehrenberg , 1833 ) .",
    "data sets were consisting of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 data points for _ l. senator _ , _ c. brachydactyla _ and _ h. pallida _ , respectively .",
    "there were 12 predictive variables .",
    "6 of them were satellite image data from landsat corresponding to the bands tm1-tm5 and tm7 .",
    "each of these bands are generally implicated in reflecting a different attribute of the vegetation cover and land geography @xcite .",
    "remaining predictive variables included annual mean temperature ( @xmath20c ) , annual mean humidity ( % ) , distance to nearest road ( m ) , distance to nearest water source ( m ) , the height of the sampling point from sea level , and a vegetation index , which was a dimensionless categorical variable indicating the type of the vegetation with respect to its height , ranging between 1 - 9 , 1 being the shortest vegetation type @xcite .",
    "the dependent variable was binary indicating the breeding presence or absence of bird species in question .",
    "we split the data set for each species into two by randomly selecting half of the data corresponding to each output category for each species and sparing those selected data as test sets ( independent tests ) , while using the other half for training the models .",
    "hence , three sets of each model considered in this study were built separately and fit on half of the data set for each species and then tested on the other half of the data , which were not used during training , for that particular species .",
    "detailed description of the study sites and data collection among with a through discussion of the biology of the bird species can be found in @xcite .      this particular data set concerned the habitat preferences of 9 bird species in central anatolia , namely great reed warbler _ ( acrocephalus arundinaceus _ linnaeus , 1978 ) , skylark ( _ alauda arvensis _",
    "linnaeus , 1758 ) , short - toed lark ( _ calandrella brachydactyla _ leisler , 1814 ) , lesser short - toed lark ( _ calandrella rufescens _ vieillot , 1820 ) , marsh harrier ( _ circus aeruginosus _ linnaeus , 1758 ) , calandra lark ( _ melanocorypha calandra _ linnaeus , 1766 ) , corn bunting ( _ milaria calandra _ linnaeus , 1758 ) , yellow wagtail ( _ motacilla flava _ linnaeus , 1758 ) and isabellina wheatear ( _ oenanthe isabellina _ isabellina temminck , 1829 ) .",
    "the data has been collected from sultan marshes and tuzla lake in central anatolia during 2002 .    in field studies ,",
    "the presence ( 1 ) or absence ( 0 ) of each bird species on a particular spot were recorded along with the environmental variables , and were used as dependent variable for models .",
    "there were 12 predictive variables .",
    "these were vegetation index , which was a categorical variable with 23 categories @xcite , percent vegetation cover ( % ) , stem height ( cm ) , water depth ( cm ) , grazing , which was a semantic variable with 4 categories ranging from 0 ( none ) to 3 ( extensive ) , and 6 satellite imagery bands .",
    "the images used were obtained from landsat satellite , and the bands used as independent variables were tm1 - 5 and tm7 .",
    "sample size for each species is given in table [ tab : esra ] .",
    "detailed description of the satellite images , and the properties of the bands used here , as well a a description of the study sites and the biology of the bird species considered can be found in @xcite .    for this data set 9 separate sets of models",
    "have been built for each species .",
    "five of them ( sets 1 - 5 ) were fit to the data collected in sultan marshes for each species and then tested on the data collected in lake tuzla for that species ( independent tests ) . remaining 4 set of models ( sets 6 - 9 ) were fit to the half of the data randomly split from data collected in lake tuzla for each species separately , and models were then tested on the remaining half ( validation ) .",
    "in this section , an overview of the pattern recognition and classification models used for this study are reviewed . it is not meant to be exhaustive , and interested readers are referred to the authoritative references in relevant sections . a short description of the specific implementation details for the current study is provided at the end of the section .",
    "often , predictive variables in a given model are of different units which are not compatible with each other . for instance a model may include both a distance measure given in meters as well as the concentration of a particular nutrient given in @xmath5gl@xmath6 ( e.g. data sets 1 and 2 ; sections [ sec : eymir : mogan ] and [ sec:5lakes ] ) as a predictive variable . or it may include a dimensionless variable among several others with compatible units ( e.g. section [ sec : robertson : erie ] ) . similarly , some predictive variables could be given in compatible , or even same units but spanning different ranges of values .",
    "for example the data set from lakes eymir and mogan ( data set 1 ; section [ sec : eymir : mogan ] ) include chlorophyll - a concentration as well as total phosphorus concentration , both given in @xmath5gl@xmath6 . but while the former spans a value range between @xmath21 $ ] , the latter variable spans a value range of @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "such incompatibilities are known to reduce the stability and performance of statistical models as the initial randomization of model parameters , or the weights , will not be effective if the predictive variables are on different scales @xcite . in such cases , to ensure the stability and convergence of the model to a solution , it is necessary to standardize the input variables to a consistent dimensionless interval .",
    "one commonly employed standardization scheme is to linearly transform the independent variables to mean of zero and units of standard deviation , also known as z - score transformation @xcite , such that the @xmath23th value of the @xmath24th predictive variable is transformed as :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mean and standard deviation of the @xmath24th variable .",
    "if standard deviations differ substantially among variables ( as is usually the case if binary or categorical variables are included in the input space ) , it is preferable to linearly transform the values of all predictive variables to lie in the range of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "note that in this case , the mean will not be zero unless the mean of the raw predictor was centered between its minimum and maximum values .",
    "one other approach to standardize the input space is to use hypercube transformation such that after transforming , input variables lie in a space @xmath29^{p}$ ] where @xmath30 is the number of input variables :    @xmath31    where @xmath32^{p}$ ] is the transformed data point @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to standardization , hypercube transformation also provides a strictly bounded input space , and thus it is of theoretical importance for classification , and in general statistical modeling techniques , especially for art family of models ( section [ sec : artmap ] ) .",
    "a review of these theoretical considerations is beyond the scope of this paper , and interested readers are referred to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in all cases , after fitting the model , the variables can then be inversely transformed for predictive purposes .    all data used in this study were z - score transformed before feeding into the models except for artmap , for which the input data were hypercube transformed .        for comparative purposes , we used k - nearest neighbor ( k - nn ) , linear and quadratic discriminant ( lda and qda ) methods to classify our data points according to the output classes ( dependent variables ) .",
    "k - nn method has been considered as a benchmark classification method , if one considers only the training data .",
    "this method uses those observations in the training set @xmath34 closest in the input space to @xmath35 to form @xmath36 .",
    "more specifically ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the neighborhood of @xmath35 defined by the @xmath24 closest points @xmath39 in the training sample .",
    "it is clear that when the neighborhood @xmath24 is considered to be @xmath40 , k - nn method potentially can reach to minimum classification error on the training set .",
    "note that in this case the error on test set is expected to be quite high .",
    "thus , k - nn method with a neighborhood size @xmath41 is employed in this study as a benchmark of training set performance .",
    "lda and qda techniques are models based on the class densities of the output categories . in other words ,",
    "they enable one to infer the posterior probabilities of the output categories based on the data observed , using bayes theorem :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the class - conditional density of @xmath44 in class @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the prior probability of class @xmath24 with @xmath47 .",
    "lda and qda assume gaussian distribution for class densities .",
    "fundamentally , for two category cases ( as in our case ) , and assuming that the covariances @xmath48 of the class densities are equal , linear discriminant function is given as    @xmath49    where the parameters of the gaussian distributions are estimated from the data as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the number of class-@xmath24 observations .",
    "an equivalent decision rule is given as @xmath52 .",
    "if the equality assumption of class covariances @xmath48 does not hold , we obtain quadratic discriminant function    @xmath53    with an equivalent decision boundary between each pairs of classes @xmath24 and @xmath54 described by a quadratic equation @xmath55 .",
    "both lda and qda are shown to perform astonishingly well on large and diverse set of classification tasks , and both techniques are widely used in various research areas @xcite .",
    "thus , we included these two models as potential benchmarks to compare the performances of other methods against , assuming that the data considered in this study are distributed following a gaussian distribution .",
    "note that discriminant analyses , both linear and quadratic , strictly require that the underlying data are distributed as a gaussian .",
    "a more in - depth discussion of these two methods , among with k - nn method , can be found in @xcite      a general linear model is similar to classical multiple regression analysis such that the explanatory variables , @xmath56 , multiplied by weights , @xmath57 , obtained by statistical estimation , are summed together for a score , @xmath58 :    @xmath59    setting    @xmath60    a general liner model is analogous to multiple regression models with the estimated values being transformed through a nonlinear signal function ( sigmoid , in our case ) for simple linear prediction with continuous ( analog ) dependent variables , @xmath61 might have intrinsic meaning . for binary outcome events , as in our cases",
    ", however , a link function that monotonically constrains the output prediction to lie between 0 and 1 is required .",
    "an asymmetric logistic function , ranging from 0 to 1 , is a common choice , as it is analogous to the probability that a given pattern is associated with a particular output class :    @xmath62    for training and performance assessment purposes , a score threshold @xmath63 is required to assign the predicted probability to one of the output classes such that if the output prediction is above @xmath63 it is classified as 1 and to 0 if @xmath64 .",
    "an obvious choice for binary outcome events is @xmath65 .",
    "as with the case of multiple regression , general linear models ( glm ) are equivalent to connectionist neural networks without any hidden layers .",
    "glm are designed to emphasize the linear combination of predictive variables in explaining the dependent variable(s ) , as they do not include any processes for nonlinearly transforming the input space",
    ". however , ecological , or more generally biological systems inherently include nonlinearities @xcite , which may severely limit the performance of linear models @xcite .",
    "for that reason , artificial neural networks , particularly feedforward multilayer backpropagation networks , which are designed to capture the nonlinear interactions in the input space , are favored in recent years @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "artificial neural networks are computationally expensive compared to linear models . in some cases they offer only a little , if any , improvement over generalized linear models @xcite .",
    "glms have been successfully applied to several data sets in ecology ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "connectionist neural networks are among the most applied and well known class of supervised statistical models .",
    "these networks are composed of an input layer , an arbitrary number of hidden layers with arbitrary number of hidden units in each layer , and an output layer .",
    "the network is commonly ( but not necessarily ) fully connected , meaning that each node in a given layer @xmath66 is connected to all of the nodes in the next layer @xmath67 .",
    "these networks are also feedforward , such that the information flows from input layer to hidden layer(s ) to output layer in only forward direction .",
    "feedforward neural networks are formally defined as follows :    let @xmath68 be the set of all affine functions from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , that is the set of all functions in the form @xmath71 . for any measurable function",
    "@xmath72 mapping @xmath70 to @xmath70 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the class of functions    @xmath75    where the product term disappears for networks without hidden layer , and the equation reduces to that of generalized linear model .",
    "the function @xmath72 is the activation function , or link function , equivalent to that of output units in general linear model . again , for binary outcome event , an asymmetric logistic activation function , ranging from 0 to 1 , is suitable for output unit .",
    "however , a symmetric logistic activation function , ranging between @xmath760.5 , is generally suggested for the hidden units since a symmetric function is shown to enhance the stability of the weights of hidden units during backpropagation of errors @xcite .",
    "[ sec : optimization ]    multilayer feedforward backpropagation networks have been successfully applied to a diverse set of data ranging from phytoplankton production @xcite to community changes based on climatic inputs @xcite , and to relationships of different species to habitat variables @xcite .",
    "model fitting procedure for feedforward neural networks , as well as for general linear models are discussed in detail in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "implementational details of glm and backpropagation models for the data sets used in this study are given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a schematic presentation of generic artmap model is provided in figure [ fig : fart ] .",
    "briefly , artmap models consist basically of two so - called art modules , which are fundamentally self - organizing maps @xcite , one for input space and one for output space**. * * learning occurs separately for each art module independently , whenever an expected category matches to presented input pattern ( i.e. , current combination of predictive variables ) , or a novel input pattern is encountered .",
    "these modules are linked by an associative learning network and an internal controller that ensures autonomous system operation in real time .",
    "thus , artmap models represent a  \" pseudo - supervised  \" learning method @xcite .",
    "the controller is designed to create a minimal number of art recognition categories ( committed nodes ; that is , abstract representations of combinations of input vectors ) for the input space , or  \" hidden units  \" analogous to backpropagation networks , needed to meet an accuracy criteria , which is given by the so - called  \" vigilance  \" parameter @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "artmap algorithm fundamentally works by increasing the vigilance parameter of the input art module by the minimal amount needed to correct a predictive error at art module of the output classes .",
    "there are several variants of art modules @xcite . here , we used fuzzy art modules , which are developed for pattern recognition models with continuous and/or categorical input space @xcite .",
    "fuzzy art and fuzzy artmap models use fuzzy logic operators @xcite for category choices and match criteria , as well as for learning in the model operation .",
    "shortly , each art system contains an input field @xmath78",
    ", a @xmath79 field receiving bottom - up signals from @xmath78 and top - down input from @xmath80 , the latter of which represents the active category representations**. * * so - called _ complement coding _",
    "@xcite should be employed before feeding the input vectors to fuzzy art modules .",
    "fundamentally by complement coding , it is meant that an @xmath81-dimensional input matrix @xmath82 is coded and fed to the model as an @xmath83-dimensional matrix @xmath84 $ ] , where @xmath85 .",
    "theoretical considerations for this requirement are discussed in detail in @xcite .    at each @xmath80 category node",
    ", there is a weight associated with that node , which are initially set to 1 .",
    "each weight @xmath86 is monotonically increasing with time and hence its convergence to a limit is guaranteed @xcite .",

    "the search process continues until the chosen @xmath100 satisfies the resonance criterion ( equation [ eq : resonance ] ) .",

    "when a prediction by art@xmath105 module , which receives the input vectors , is disconfirmed at art@xmath106 module , receiving target , or output , vector , inhibition of map field activation induces the match tracking process , which raises the art@xmath105 vigilance @xmath107 to just above the @xmath108 so that the activation of @xmath109 matches the reset criterion ( i.e. , decreased just to miss the match criterion given by equation [ eq : resonance ] ) .",

    "a compact review of implementational issues can be found in @xcite .",
    "to asses the performance of statistical models , a score ( error ) is employed which is to be maximized ( minimized ) . for models with continuous - valued dependent variables ,",
    "a commonly employed choice is the least squares error :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 and @xmath58 are actual and predicted values of the dependent variable , respectively . for binary or categorical outcome events , however , a cross - entropy measure as a score measure is preferred @xcite :    @xmath113    where @xmath114 is the actual activation of output unit and @xmath115 is the predicted activation .",
    "cross - entropy , as calculated by equation [ eq : cindex ] , is approximately equal to the area under receiver - operator curve @xcite , and it is also equivalent to log likelihood .",
    "hence , maximizing equation [ eq : cindex ] is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the model estimate @xcite .",
    "note that by definition of roc curve , c - index measures the ratio of hit rate to false - alarm rate .",
    "thus , if the number of samples are balanced with respect to each output category , c - index is equivalent to the percentage of data points correctly classified by the algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , the latter measure is significantly biased for unbalanced data sets , and c - index should be preferred in such cases @xcite . for the current study , we used c - index to assess the performances of glm and backpropagation networks and percent of the samples correctly classified for k - nn , lda , qda , and artmap models . in all of the data sets considered in this study , whenever the number of data points corresponding to each output category were unbalanced , the data is truncated by randomly discarding necessary number of samples corresponding to the output category with excessive number of samples .",
    "this ensures the compatibility of different performance indices ( c - index and percent correctly classified ) in different models .",
    "hence , the data used in this study were perfectly balanced with respect to the output categories .",
    "as briefly mentioned in the introduction , the error rate of a given model decreases monotonically toward zero on training data set as the model is fitted to the training data . in other words ,",
    "the model loses its ability to generalize as it is fitted to the training data more and more , a phenomenon termed as overfitting , or overtraining in statistical modeling literature @xcite . to avoid overfitting of the data during training , a cross - validation procedure may be employed during training @xcite . for cross - validation , the training data set is shuffled and a certain amount of data is used as a holdout subset at each iteration . at each iteration , model is fit to the rest of the data and the predictive performance is validated on holdout set , allowing the algorithm to stop training at a point optimal to avoid overfitting and be able to capture the overall characteristics if the system and not the peculiarities .",
    "bootstrapping of the training data also enables to determine the maximum number of epochs to train the models , as well as to assess the stability and variability of the model estimates @xcite . to bootstrap the model , @xmath116 draws with replacement are performed from the training dataset , where @xmath116 is training set sample size , and this process was repeated @xmath117 times , to create @xmath117 booted data sets , each of size @xmath116 .",

    "@xcite argued about the redundancy of independent tests in predictive models in ecology , claiming that there is no particular interest in estimating the predictive ability of a model in a universe different from which it was built .",
    "however , the importance of the ability of a given model , in terms of its performance on an independent test data set , is emphasized in several studies @xcite .",
    "intuitively , observations from a given system corresponds not to a universe of events , but rather to finite - size samples from a larger universe of events .",
    "hence , an ideal statistical model should be able to predict not only the outcome of events ( samples ) on which it was built , but also to predict the states of the system in the face of events which has not been encountered in the finite size samples .",
    "hence , a given model should minimize the error rate on training set ( that is , samples used to fit the model ) at the same time maximizing the performance on an independent data set which has not been encountered before , if the model is to be robust @xcite .",
    "thus , its performance on independent test data , shows its ability to generalize , and indicates the robustness of the model for a given system , rather than its performance on training set , which simply indicates its ability to fit to the sample at hand .    the ability of a given model to avoid overfitting and to generalize depends on how closely a model maps the input space to output space , that is on the number of abstract category representations corresponding to combinations of predictive vectors , in the case of global models such as glm , backpropagation @xcite and artmap @xcite . in the case of traditional classification models ,",
    "it depends on the number of neighborhoods for k - nn model , and on the number of output classes and predictive variables for lda and qda @xcite .",
    "thus , the flexibility of k - nn , lda and qda is fixed , equal to @xmath41 for k - nn , and is proportional to the number of predictive variables for lda , qda and glm , in our case . for backpropagation",
    ", it is represented by the number of hidden units determined _ a priori _ , and for artmap by the number of committed nodes after training .    in the extreme case",
    ", the flexibility of a model could be equal or more than the number of observations ( i.e. , training points ) , and in that case , the model would memorize the training data , fitting perfectly , while any observation different in the test samples from the training points would cause a random prediction , hence rendering the ability to generalize impossible .",
    "this corresponds to so called overfitting of a model @xcite .",
    "thus , the ability of a given model to generalize on independent test data would be evident from a trade - off between its performance on training set and the flexibility of the model achieving that performance .",
    "the importance of the flexibility of a model for fitting the training data and of the independent test to assess the actual performance of a given model is evident in our study as well .      in the case of data set 1 ,",
    "although artmap performs better than other models , independent test performance of glm , which is considerably better than artmap , renders glm to be applicable in that case .",
    "even a more drastic case took place * * * * in data set 2 * * , * * on which backpropagation model with 5 hidden units and artmap model with 11 committed nodes predicted almost the same fraction of the training sample .",
    "their predictive performances on validation data set , which consisted of the fraction of data initially split from the original data , are also appear to be in close proximity . however , if the same models were tested on an independent test , which consisted of data collected from a spatially and temporally distinct system , predictive performance of artmap model dropped drastically to 0.67 , whereas backpropagation model retained its robustness .",
    "* * * * considering the fact that artmap used a higher number of abstract category representations ( i.e. , committed nodes ) compared to the backpropagation model ( number of hidden units ) , apparent poor performance of artmap on independent test set is not surprising .",
    "one can argue , however , that the system constituting to the independent test sample might be governed be completely different dynamics and as such it can not be predicted by a model trained on separate systems .",
    "however , all 5 lakes constituting to training and test data sets are located in the same climatic zone , and all these 5 lakes are ecologically governed by more or less similar mechanisms , as far as the predictive variables concerned @xcite . furthermore , the fact that backpropagation model indeed predicted all the cases in the test set correctly renders such an argument unlikely .      in the case of data",
    "set 3 , k - nn and artmap * * * * models appear to have a greater predictive power on the training set compared to other models , the performance criteria being around 0.8 .",
    "however , none of the models performed better than random on test data sets , the performance indices being around 0.5 , with a slight improvement in glm and backpropagation models on two test sets .",
    "this might be because of the small sample sizes used as training set ( 230 ) though this sample size is considerably larger than that of the data set 1 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "moreover , as mentioned in section [ sec : robertson : erie ] , because one set of the models were developed to predict breeding success and the other nest occurrence , the assumption has been made _ a priori _ that a high probability of nest occurrence corresponds to a high probability of breeding success and vice versa .",
    "in addition , since the connecticut wetland variables did not include stem density , the average value of stem density from the lake erie wetlands was used when testing connecticut wetlands data on the lake erie model .",
    "note also that a second _ a priori _ assumption , namely that stem height and nest height were correlated , was made for using these two sets of data as independent tests for each other . for that reason , it is quite likely that these _ a priori _ assumptions have been violated by the data , and further data collection , or further characterization of habitat variables , might be required in order to ensure the compatibility of these two sets with each other and to improve the predictive performances of the models on both training and test sets .",
    "regardless of the underlying reason , however , this poor performance of all the models on test sets emphasizes the importance of independent test for assessing the actual predictive performance of a given model .",
    "if , for example , artmap model trained in the data collected in 1995 were applied for predicting the nest occurrence in the same area in 1996 , based purely on its relatively high performance on training data set , it would produce misleading results .",
    "this is indicated by the fact that its performance on test data collected in the same area in 1996 is not better than random chance level . in this case",
    ", it is apparent that the model should be improved by , for example , obtaining more samples , or changing the model structure and/or type .",
    "model improvement is beyond the scope of the current study .",
    "nevertheless , there are several techniques based on information theoretical approaches for improving the predictive performance of models , readily available in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and particular examples for predicting habitat selection and distribution of bird species are provided in the literature for the case of general additive models ( gams ) , which are marginally related to glms @xcite .      for data set 4 , a general pattern emerged for all three sets that k - nn and artmap models are again superior to other techniques on the training set performance .",
    "inspection of the independent test results , however , revealed that , k - nn has a broader ability to generalize over the new data sets . *",
    "* * * it is especially intriguing that the performance of k - nn models , which are trained on the data collected either in 1969 or 1970 , on test sets degrades when the models were tested on all saints data collected during the same period , while the performance is reasonably well on samples collected in stubble and darr marshes collected in 1995 and 1996 . nevertheless , as apparent from table figure [ fig : robertson ] , when trained on the complete data set ( train set 1 ) , k - nn model successfully predicts the breeding success in all of the test cases without any exceptions .",
    "this might probably be as a result of the fact that the data in this case covers a relatively broad temporal domain ( 2 years instead of 1 year ) . * * * * note also that in the case of robertson data , * * * * performance on the independent tests are boosted for spatial sets , that is , the models are in general more generalizable on temporal domain but as such is not true for spatial domain , this might in turn indicate the importance of training data set .      for data set 5 , there was a clear dominance of artmap models , in terms of the predictive power on both training and test sets , note that in contrast to the same models performance on central anatolian shallow lakes ( data set 2 ) , artmap achieved a performance of 1.00 with considerably less number of abstract category representations than backpropagation models .",
    "thus artmap is expected to be more generalizable than backpropagation models . for this case , when the performances on training sets are considered , discriminant analyses , both linear and quadratic , performed considerably worse than other models .",
    "surprisingly , the performances of artmap models on independent test sets is noteworthy , being close to 1 for each case , while backpropagation models suffer from being close to random chance level on validation and independent test sets , with few exceptions .",
    "when considering data set 6 , it was apparent that again , k - nn and artmap models are superior to other models , in terms of their predictive performance on training data sets .",
    "nevertheless , comparison of predictive performances on validation and independent tests indicated that k - nn had a better predictive performance compared to that of artmap .",
    "k - nn successfully predicted the test data sets above chance level with the only exception of set 5 . note that in the case of these data , sets 1 - 5 include test samples collected from a spatially distinct region than the samples for training data .",
    "this , in turn , indicates that k - nn models , in this case are particularly robust in terms of their ability to generalize over new data sets .      on all data sets , traditional discriminant analyses , linear and quadratic ,",
    "had a poor predictive performance on both training and independent test data sets .",
    "note , however , from section [ sec : traditional ] that discriminant analyses strictly require that the underlying data to be sampled from a gaussian distribution .",
    "several studies in the literature appear to employ discriminant analysis to infer species distribution or occurrence , and attain reasonably good predictive performance @xcite , in contrast to our study . despite their considerable success , however , we do not recommend traditional discriminant analysis for prediction purposes , unless one makes sure that the underlying data is distributed appropriately , or filtered through a suitable transformation in preprocessing stage to satisfy the required parametric distribution .",
    "statistical learning models associate a probability with each alternative state given the simultaneous observation of all variables at a given time step ( or the whole set of past observations in the case of unsupervised methods ) @xcite .",
    "once the model is trained , resulting probability densities associated with each state are used to predict and forecast the state the system will occupy based on the new observations . for predictive modeling of ecosystems",
    "which are known to exhibit multiple stable states and catastrophic regime changes @xcite , this probabilistic design can also be exploited as ( at least ) a qualitative measure of the distance to threshold for regime changes , in addition to identifying bifurcations and regime shifts in ecosystem dynamics , by combining probabilities associated with the points in input space with the sensitivity analyses , which systematically scan the input space @xcite .",
    "presentation and elaboration of sensitivity analyses are beyond the scope of this study , however , sensitivity analyses of glm and/or connectionist neural network models for our data sets can be found elsewhere @xcite , and a through discussion of their use in identifying regime shifts and thresholds associated with these shifts for data sets 1 and 2 ( lakes eymir and mogan , and central anatolian shallow lakes ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "note that two main types of ecological data have been considered in this study : one type of data ( data sets 1 and 2 ) consisted of time - dependent data , meaning that the dynamics governing these systems depend on the passage of time , including small- to large - scale periodicities . however , the second type ( data sets 3 - 6 ) was time - independent , or strictly stationary , in the sense that possible periodic dynamics and trends governing these systems are expected to be well beyond the time - scale of the data collection . statistical classification methods are , however , known to be insensitive to the time correlations or interactions of individual variables over a time series ,",
    "i.e they can not capture temporal system dynamics , unless an explicit independent variable reflecting the time - dependence and periodicities within the series is included _ a priori , _ as such is also true for connectionist neural network models .",
    "note that on the first type of data ( data sets 1 and 2 ) , connectionist neural network models ( glm and multilayered feedforward backpropagation ) achieved a fairly good predictive performance , both on training and test data sets .",
    "these models apparently captured the nonlinear interactions between the variables as well as inherent non - stationarity of the data .",
    "however , note that for one of these data ( data set 1 ) , we included the z - score transformation of the water level , which inherently reflects the periodic changes due to the seasonal periodicities of the system . in the other data set ( 2 ) , we included an explicit representation of the time series ( period index ) as well as water level data which , again , was expected to reflect the periodicities inherent in the system .",
    "@xcite used a generalized linear modeling approach to predict the occurrence of a lucanid beetle species based on habitat variables , but their model attained to a relatively moderate predictive performance on predicting species abundance and occurrence .",
    "we suggest that the moderate discriminatory ability of their model is , at least partly , mediated by the lack of account to periodic dynamics .",
    "similarly , @xcite employed a generalized additive model , which is analogous to generalized linear models , to predict the occurrence of mollusk species , and showed that the inclusion of climatic variables contributed significantly to the predictive ability of their model .",
    "this is presumably because climatic variables reflect at least seasonal periodic dynamics of the system , considering that climatic forces are among the most important driving forces for a given ecosystem . as connectionist neural network model are closely related to generalized linear models ( section [ sec : glm ] ) ,",
    "the same reasoning is applicable to these models as well .",
    "thus , we suggest that for data sets over time - scales which are smaller than the seasonal and other possible periodic dynamics of the system , an explicit predictive variable should be included in the model that potentially reflects these periodic dynamics , either directly ( as period index ) , or indirectly ( as water level z - score ) , at least for the case of glm or connectionist neural network models .",
    "existing literature of predictive modeling in ecology emphasizes the advantages and predictive power of connectionist neural network approaches owing to these models inherent ability to capture complex nonlinear interactions between the predictive variables @xcite .",
    "however , this celebrated predictive performance also brings about an increased complexity and thus an increased computational costs resulted from this complexity .",
    "the computational cost of these models could be overwhelming especially with larger data sets .",
    "however , as the model on data set 1 shows , glms could attain a significant predictive performance , at the same time avoiding the costs of neural network models .",
    "thus , we suggest that one should fit a glm to the data set before considering a neural network approach , a high predictive power of which would render the computational cost associated with neural networks unnecessary .    for the time - independent data sets ( data sets 3 - 6 ) ,",
    "our results show that neighborhood - based methods , k - nn and artmap , are superior in terms of their predictive performances compared to other techniques , both on training and test data sets .",
    "test * * * * performance of k - nn and artmap models on data set 3 appears to be an exception to this , and possible reason for this exception is discussed above . based on our results , nevertheless , we suggest that k - nn and artmap models are more suitable for spatial data , such as habitat selection and species distribution instead of more dynamic alternatives such as glm and connectionist neural network models , at least if the time - scale considered is assured to be relatively insignificant compared to the time - dependent periodicities governing ecosystem dynamics .",
    "artmap , although considered as a neural network architecture , is implicitly a neighborhood - based classification technique .",
    "a geometric interpretation of the operation of artmap @xcite suggests that its operation is analogous to k - nn neighbor method .",
    "an important difference is that while the size of the neighborhood is fixed for k - nn , it is adaptive in artmap , adjusted on - the - fly depending on the performance of the model on current data point ( and previous ones ) .",
    "thus , analogous to the relation between glm and connectionist neural network models , we consider k - nn to be a relatively primitive , computationally less expensive alternative to artmap . on our spatial data sets ,",
    "k - nn performed considerably better than artmap on 2 of the 3 cases ( data sets 4 and 6 ) on independent test sets .",
    "hence , we suggest that k - nn should be considered for predictive spatial modeling before considering a more advanced but complex model such as artmap .",
    "our study suggests that different methods for statistical predictive modeling of ecosystems are suitable , depending on the data sets and ecosystem dynamics that are to be modeled . for the cases involving data sets whose underlying distribution is unknown , or presumed to be irregular , traditional statistical models such as discriminant analyses have poor predictive performances and thus could lead to misleading and invalid predictions . for the data sets involving time - dependent dynamics and periodicities whose frequency are possibly less than the time scale of the data considered , glm and connectionist neural network models , such as multilayer feedforward backpropagation models , appear to be most suitable , in terms of their performance on both training and test sets ,",
    "provided that a predictive variable reflecting these time - dependent dynamics , either implicitly or explicitly in included in the model . for spatial data , which does not include any time - dependence comparable to the time scale covered by the data , on the other hand , neighborhood based methods such as k - nn and artmap proved to be more robust than other methods considered in this study .",
    "however , for predictive modeling purposes , one should consider applying first a suitable , computationally inexpensive method to the data at hand , a good predictive performance of which would render the computational cost and efforts associated with complex variants unnecessary",
    ". further characterization of the data included in this study using different and/or variants of the methods considered here , as well as application of the models considered here to new data sets would , nevertheless , reveal further characterizations and suggestions for suitability and applicability of statistical predictive modeling techniques in ecology .",
