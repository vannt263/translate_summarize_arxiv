    "dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite is becoming an established technique for preserving quantum states from decoherence with possible applications in quantum information @xcite and magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "the technique was devised to increase decoherence times by refocusing the system - environment interactions with a sequence of control pulses periodically applied to the system .",
    "recent experiments have successfully implemented dd methods and demonstrated the resulting increase of coherence times in different systems @xcite .",
    "these works also showed that the performance of dd sequences can be limited or even counterproductive if the accumulated effect of pulse imperfections becomes too strong @xcite .",
    "one approach to compensate the effect of these errors is to combine one basic decoupling cycle with a symmetry - related copy into a longer cycle .",
    "the resulting cycle can be more robust , i.e. less susceptible to pulse imperfections than its building blocks , provided the basic blocks are well chosen and combined in a suitable way .    in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , symmetry - related arguments",
    "have often been used for constructing supercycles @xcite . using the symmetry properties of specific interactions ,",
    "it is possible to remove them selectively while retaining or restoring others @xcite .",
    "symmetrization is widely used to eliminate unwanted odd - order average hamiltonian terms @xcite .",
    "this approach has been instrumental in the design of high - performance decoupling and recoupling sequences @xcite . besides sequence development",
    ", symmetry arguments have also been used extensively in the design of individual pulses with reduced sensitivity to experimental imperfections @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate differences between otherwise identical dd cycles , in which the timing of the pulses is either symmetric with respect to time reversal , or not . as the basic block we consider the xy-4 sequence @xcite .",
    "we compare the performance of the basic sequences as well as compensated higher - order sequences and analyze their imperfections theoretically by average hamiltonian theory @xcite and experimentally by applying quantum state tomography @xcite to the system after the end of each decoupling cycle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the basic idea of dynamic decoupling and demonstrate the relevance of time reversal symmetry in this context . in the subsequent sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] we compare different sequences based on symmetric or asymmetric building blocks . in the last section",

    "this can be achieved simply by a train of identical @xmath0-pulses , the so - called carr - purcell ( cp)- @xcite or carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg)-sequence @xcite . the shortest dd sequence that cancels the zero - order average hamiltonian for a general system- environment interaction @xcite is the xy-4 sequence @xcite ( see figures [ fig1]a and [ fig1]b ) .",

    "the dephasing of the nuclear spin signal originates from the interaction with an environment consisting of @xmath5h nuclear spins .",

    "the actual pulse propagator for a nominal @xmath0 rotation around an axis defined by @xmath28 is then @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relative flip angle error , @xmath31 , and @xmath28 is the phase of the pulse .",

    "the zeroth order average hamiltonian matches exactly the target hamiltonian , and for perfect pulses ( @xmath35 ) , the first order term vanishes , @xmath36 , as expected for any symmetric sequence . for finite pulse errors ,",
    "the first - order term contains a rotation of the spin qubit around the @xmath1 axis by an angle @xmath37 .",
    "this term results from the accumulated flip angle errors and is independent of the environment .",
    "since this term is proportional to the square of the flip angle error @xmath30 , it generates a rotation in the same direction for all spins , independent of the actual field that they experience .    the second term in eq .

    "this term combines pulse errors and the system - bath interaction .",
    "it arises from the fact that pulses that do not implement a @xmath0 rotation can not properly refocus the system - environment interaction .",

    "the commutator describes the time dependence of the system - environment interaction due to the environmental hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "this difference from the symmetric case may be understood in terms of the different positions of the echoes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ cpmg1 ] : in the asymmetric sequence , the time between echoes is twice as long as in the symmetric sequence , which means that a time - dependent environment has a bigger effect . in the symmetric sequence , the effect of the time - dependent environment appears only in the next - higher order term .",
    "rules for improving the performance of multiple pulse sequences were discussed , e.g. , in the context of broadband heteronuclear decoupling @xcite or for the compensated carr - purcell sequences @xcite .",
    "if we combine a xy-4 cycle with its time - reversed image to an xy-8 cycle , we obtain a time - symmetric cycle , even if we start from the non - time symmetric block .",
    "nevertheless , we expect different results for the two cases .",
    "an explicit calculation of the average hamiltonian for the combined cycle shows that @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e. all deviations from the ideal hamiltonian vanish to first order .",
    "this remains true for finite pulse errors : the symmetry of the sequence cancels the effect of pulse errors in all odd - order average hamiltonian terms .",
    "we therefore proceed to calculate the second order terms . for simplicity",

    "first , we assume that the environmental hamiltonian vanishes , @xmath42 .",

    "the interaction between the carbon nuclei can be neglected and the decoherence mechanism is a pure dephasing process @xcite , the evolution of the system and environment is thus described by the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "the experiments were performed on a homebuilt 300 mhz solid - state nmr spectrometer . the basic experimental scheme consisted of : a state preparation period , during which we prepared the carbon spins in a superposition state oriented along the @xmath10 direction , a variable evolution period , where dd sequences were applied , and the final read out period where we determine the final state by quantum state tomography @xcite .",

    "the precession of the magnetization around the @xmath1-axis that we observe for some of the sequences causes a deviation of the system from the desired evolution and reduces therefore the fidelity of the process .",
    "however , compared to a dephasing process , it is easier to correct and can in principle be compensated if it is known .",

    "many different sequences have been put forward for reducing the effect of the environmental noise on the system . since the number of possible sequences is infinite , a relatively straightforward approach for designing improved sequences consists in concatenating different building blocks in such a way that the resulting cycle has a smaller overall average hamiltonian than that of its component blocks . in this paper",
    "we consider the xy-4 sequence as a basic building block .",
    "since different versions of the xy-4 sequence were proposed in the literature , some of them symmetric in time , others asymmetric , we compare these two versions and in particular the different sequences that result when they are concatenated with time - inverted and phase - shifted copies .",
    "since time - symmetric sequences generate average hamiltonians in which all odd - order terms vanish for ideal pulses , it is expected that they perform better than non - symmetric but otherwise identical sequences .",
    "experimentally , we could not verify this for the xy-4 sequence , since pulse errors dominate the behavior under our experimental conditions .",
    "however , in the case of the cpmg sequence , where pulse errors are insignificant , we could clearly verify this expectation .",
    "the symmetry of the basic building blocks is also important when they are concatenated to higher order sequences , such as the xy-8 and xy-16 sequences @xcite . in this case , the odd order terms vanish in the average hamiltonians of both sequences , but the second order terms of the sequences that are built from asymmetric blocks contain additional unwanted terms .",
    "the experimental data are in agreement with this observation : sequences consisting of time symmetric building blocks perform significantly better than the corresponding sequences formed by time asymmetric blocks .    in order to understand the decay processes during the dd sequences , we performed quantum state tomography as a function of time .",
    "the results from these measurements show two different contributions to the overall fidelity loss : a precession around the @xmath1-axis , which we could attribute to the combined effect of flip - angle errors and an overall reduction of the amplitude , which results from the system - environment interaction . for short delays between the pulses and correspondingly large number of pulses ,",
