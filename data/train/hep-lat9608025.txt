    "a possible way of testing our understanding of second order phase transitions consists in calculating the critical exponents as accurately as possible . ideally , one would like to use several independent methods and obtain an agreement within small errors .",
    "the renormalization group method@xcite has provided several approximate methods to calculate the critical exponents of lattice models in various dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "the same exponents can be estimated from the analysis of high - temperature series@xcite . showing that these methods give precisely the same answers",
    "has been a challenging problem@xcite . in general , one would expect that a well - established discrepancy could either reveal new aspects of the critical behavior of the model considered or point out the inadequacy of some of the methods used .    in order to carry through this program",
    ", one needs to overcome technical difficulties which are specific to the methods used .",
    "an important problem with the high - temperature expansion@xcite is that one needs _ much _",
    "longer series than the ones available@xcite ( which do not go beyond order 25 in most of the cases ) in order to make precise estimates . on the other hand ,",
    "a problem specific to the renormalization group method is that the practical implementation of the method usually requires projections into a manageable subset of parameters characterizing the interactions .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to design a non - trivial lattice model@xcite , referred to hereafter as dyson s hierarchical model ( in order to avoid confusion with other models also called  hierarchical \" ) , which can be seen as an approximate version of nearest neighbor models and for which these two technical difficulties can be overcome . for dyson s hierarchical model , the renormalization group transformation reduces to a simple integral equation involving only the local measure .",
    "this simplicity allows one to control rigorously@xcite the renormalization group transformation and to obtain accurate estimates of the eigenvalues of the linearized renormalization group transformation@xcite .",
    "more recently , we have shown that the recursion formula can be put in a form@xcite suitable to the calculation of the high - temperature expansion to very large order .",
    "consequently , dyson s hierarchical model is well suited to compare the @xmath2-expansion and the high - temperature expansion .",
    "note that unlike the @xmath2-expansion , the high - temperature expansion depends on the choice of a local measure of integration for the spin variables ( e.g. a ising or landau - ginzburg measure ) . in order to make this choice explicit when necessary , we will , for instance , speak of dyson s hierarchical ising model if we are using a ising measure .    in a recent publication@xcite , we reported results concerning the high - temperature expansion of dyson s hierarchical ising model .",
    "we found clear evidence for oscillations in the quantity used to estimate the critical exponent @xmath0 , called the extrapolated slope ( see section iii ) .",
    "when using a log scale for the order in the high - temperature expansion , these oscillations become regularly spaced .",
    "we provided two possible interpretations .",
    "the first is that the eigenvalues of the linearized renormalization group are complex .",
    "the second is that the eigenvalues stay real but that the constants appearing in the conventional parametrization of the magnetic susceptibility should be replaced by functions of @xmath3 invariant under the rescaling of @xmath3 by @xmath4 , the largest eigenvalue of the linearized renormalization group transformation .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this explanation as  the second possibility \"",
    ". this second possibility has been mentioned twice by k. wilson@xcite and developed systematically by niemeijer and van leeuwen@xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we gave several arguments against the first possibility .",
    "a more convincing argument is given in section vii : explicit calculations of the first fourteen eigenvalues of the linearized renormalization group transformation not relying on the @xmath2 or high - temperature expansion show no evidence for complex eigenvalues of the linearized transformation .",
    "in addition , all the results presented below support the second possibility .    in this article , we report the results of calculations of the high - temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility of dyson s hierarchical model up to order 800 with a landau - ginzburg measure .",
    "these calculations provide good evidence that the oscillations appear with a universal frequency given by the second possibility@xcite discussed above but with a measure - dependent phase and amplitude . before going into the technical details related to the analysis of the series , we would like to state additional conclusions .",
    "first , we found no significant discrepancy between the high - temperature expansion and the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "second , with the existing methods , the high - temperature expansion appears as a rather inefficient way to estimate the critical exponents of dyson s hierarchical model .",
    "third , the high - temperature expansion reveals small oscillatory corrections to the scaling laws which can not be detected from the study of the _ linearized _ renormalization group transformation .",
    "these conclusions were reached after a rather lengthy analysis .",
    "the second possibility introduces potentially an infinite number of fourier coefficients and it is useful to first work with simplified examples in order to develop a strategy to fit the data with as few unknown parameters as possible .",
    "solvable models where the second possibility is realized were proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "these models are sometimes called  ising hierarchical lattice models \" and should not be confused with dyson s models . further analysis of these models shows that the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane are distributed on the ( very decorative ) julia set@xcite of a rational transformation . in particular , it is possible to relate the oscillations with poles of the mellin transform located away from the real axis at the ferromagnetic critical point .",
    "in addition , the calculation of the amplitude of oscillation for these models illustrates a feature which we believe is rather general , namely that the oscillations tend to `` hide '' themselves : large frequencies imply ( exponentially ) small amplitudes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we specify the models considered and the methods used for the calculations . in section iii , we explain how to estimate the critical exponent @xmath5 using the so - called extrapolated slope@xcite .",
    "we discuss the effects of the new oscillatory terms on this quantity , using assumptions which are motivated in subsequent sections . in section iv , we show that despite a large amplification , the systematic and numerical errors on the coefficients play no role in our discussion of the oscillations of the extrapolated slope .",
    "this section also provides a test of our calculation method in an explicitly solvable case , namely dyson s hierarchical gaussian model .",
    "inspired by the ising hierarchical lattice models and the analytical form of the one - loop feynman diagrams for dyson s hierarchical model , we designed a simple mathematical function with a singularity corrected by log - periodic oscillations .",
    "this function is defined in section v. its power singularity , as well as the frequency , amplitudes and phases of oscillations , can be explicitly calculated .",
    "we then show that these quantities can be extracted in good approximation from a numerical analysis of the extrapolated slope associated with the taylor expansion of the function about a non - singular point . in section",
    "vi , we apply the methods developed in section v to fit the extrapolated slope associated with the various high - temperature expansions calculated .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the fact that the @xmath6 corrections to the large @xmath7 expansion - @xmath7 being the order in the high - temperature expansion - are enhanced by a factor which is approximately 160 .",
    "we start with 5 parameter fits , which give robust values for the critical exponent @xmath5 and the frequency of oscillation @xmath8 . from the study of the errors ,",
    "one can design fits with one or two more parameters which have smaller systematic errors and which are reasonably stable under small changes in the fitting interval or in the initial guesses for the values of the parameters .",
    "the results of the numerically stable fits are discussed in section vii .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath9 and @xmath0 predicted by the second possibility is well obeyed and the value of @xmath0 is in good agreement with the value obtained with the @xmath10expansion , which we have checked using independent methods .",
    "all results agree within errors of the order 0.002 .",
    "we have thus succeeded in finding a theoretical framework in which the new and existing results fit together .",
    "many questions remain : what is the origin of the oscillation ?",
    "can we calculate the amplitudes of oscillation directly ?",
    "are similar phenomena present for models with nearest neighbor interactions ? if the example of the solvable ising hierarchical lattice models can be used as a guide , these questions require a better understanding of the susceptibility in the complex temperature plane . these questions are briefly discussed in section viii .",
    "in particular , we give preliminary results concerning the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane which suggests an accumulation of zeros near the critical point .",
    "in this section , we describe dyson s hierarchical model and the methods used to calculate the high - temperature expansion of the magnetic susceptibility . the models considered here have @xmath11 sites . labeling the sites with @xmath12 indices @xmath13",
    ", each index being 0 or 1 , we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath14 the free parameter @xmath15 which controls the strength of the interactions is set equal to @xmath16 in order to approximate a nearest neighbor model in @xmath17-dimensions . in this article",
    "we _ only _ consider the case @xmath18 .",
    "the spins @xmath19 are integrated with a local measure which needs to be specified . in the following we consider the ising measure , where the spins take only the values @xmath20 , and measures where the spin variables are integrated with a weight @xmath21 , which we call landau - ginzburg measures . in the particular case @xmath22",
    ", we obtain a gaussian measure . in the following",
    "we have used @xmath23 with @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the integrations can be performed iteratively using a recursion formula studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "our calculation uses the fourier transform of this recursion formula with a rescaling of the spin variable appropriate to the study of the high - temperature fixed point@xcite .",
    "it amounts to the repeated use of the recursion formula @xmath26 which is expanded to the desired order in @xmath27 .",
    "the initial condition for the ising measure chosen here is @xmath28 . for the landau - ginsburg measure ,",
    "the coefficients in the @xmath29expansion have been evaluated numerically .",
    "the constant @xmath30 is adjusted in such a way that @xmath31 . after repeating this procedure @xmath12 times",
    ", we can extract the finite volume magnetic susceptibility @xmath32 from the taylor expansion of @xmath33 , which reads @xmath34 .",
    "this method has been presented for the ising measure in ref.@xcite and checked using results obtained with conventional graphical methods@xcite . in the calculations presented below ,",
    "we have used @xmath12=100 , which corresponds to a number of sites larger than @xmath35 .",
    "the errors associated with the finite volume are negligible compared to the errors associated with numerical round - offs as explained in section iv .",
    "in order to estimate @xmath0 , we will use a quantity called the extrapolated slope@xcite and denoted @xmath36 hereafter .",
    "the justification for this will be made clear after we recall its definition .",
    "first , we define @xmath37 , the ratio of two successive coefficients .",
    "we then define the normalized slope @xmath38 and the extrapolated slope @xmath39 as @xmath40    in the conventional description@xcite of the renormalization group flow near a fixed point with only one eigenvalue @xmath41 , the magnetic susceptibility can be expressed as @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the largest of the remaining eigenvalues .",
    "it is usually assumed that these eigenvalues are real . when this is the case , one finds@xcite that @xmath45 remarkably ,",
    "the @xmath6 corrections coming from analytic contributions have disappeared , justifying the choice of this quantity . instead of this monotonic behavior ,",
    "oscillations with a logarithmically increasing period were observed in ref .",
    "eq.(3.3 ) was then used , allowing @xmath46 and @xmath47 to be complex and selecting the real part of the modified expression .",
    "this introduces two new parameters , and the parametrization of the extrapolated slope becomes : @xmath48 this parametrization allows one to obtain good quality fits provided that @xmath7 is not too small .",
    "this parametrization is compatible with two interpretations .",
    "the first one is that the eigenvalues of the linearized renormalization group are complex .",
    "we have given@xcite several general arguments against this possibility and an explicit calculation reported in section vi makes this possibility quite implausible .",
    "the second possibility@xcite we have considered is that the eigenvalues stay real but the constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) are replaced by functions of @xmath3 invariant under the rescaling of @xmath3 by a factor @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is any positive or negative integer .",
    "this invariance implies that these functions are periodic functions in @xmath53 with period @xmath54 and can be expanded in integer powers of @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , we have the fourier expansion : @xmath56    at this point , we have no additional information about these fourier coefficients and possible restrictive relations among them .",
    "in the solvable examples@xcite where the second possibility is realized , the fourier coefficients decrease exponentially with the mode number@xcite , namely @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is a positive constant expected to be of order 1 but usually difficult to calculate .",
    "if a similar suppression occurs in the problem considered here , a truncation of the sum over the fourier mode should provide acceptable approximations ( see section v for an example ) .    if we consider the new parametrization of the susceptibility - with the constants replaced by sums over fourier modes - we obtain a parametrization of the ht coefficients as a linear combination of terms of the form @xmath60 . the asymptotic ( at large @xmath7 ) form of the coefficients",
    "is obtained from @xmath61 and the asymptotic form @xmath62 from this we obtain the following asymptotic form for the coefficients : @xmath63 where the @xmath64 and @xmath65 are ( unknown ) coefficients proportional to the ( unknown ) fourier coefficients . in the following ,",
    "we consider the case of truncated fourier series where only @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are non - zero .",
    "a tedious calculation shows that to first order in @xmath69 , @xmath68 and @xmath6 , and neglecting terms of order @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 from the solvable examples , we expect that @xmath72 should be of the same order as @xmath73 .",
    "the corrections of this order to @xmath36 read @xmath74 these corrections can be important at moderate @xmath9 ( see section v ) .",
    "importantly , we see that the @xmath6 terms have reappeared . in the case",
    "where @xmath75 , we see that all the oscillating terms are approximately in phase and proportional to @xmath76 . in the large @xmath9 limit ,",
    "the @xmath6 corrections are enhanced by a factor @xmath77 compared to the leading oscillating term .",
    "this feature will play an important role in the discussion of section vi .    before discussing the fits of the numerical values of the extrapolated slope for the ising and the landau - ginzburg cases",
    ", we will first show that the errors made in the numerical calculations do not play any significant role and then discuss the fitting strategy with a solvable example .",
    "in this section , we discuss the errors made in the calculation of the coefficients and show that they have no relevant effect on the extrapolated slope for the discussion which follows .",
    "there are two sources of errors : the numerical round - offs and the finite number of sites .",
    "we claim that with @xmath78 sites and @xmath79 , the finite volume effects are several order of magnitude smaller than the round - off errors .    from eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) , one sees that the leading volume dependence will decay like @xmath80 .",
    "this observation can be substantiated by using exact results at finite volume@xcite for low order coefficients , or by displaying the values of higher order coefficients at successive iterations as in figure 1 of ref.@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "we observe that the @xmath80 law works remarkably well . for the calculations presented here , we have used @xmath81 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) and @xmath82 , which gives volume effects on the order of @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , the round - off errors are expected to grow like the square root of the number of arithmetical operations . in ref.@xcite , we estimated this number as approximately @xmath84 for a calculation up to order @xmath7 in the high - temperature expansion with @xmath11 sites . assuming a typical round - off error in double precision of the order of @xmath85 and @xmath82",
    ", we estimate that the error on the @xmath7-th coefficient will be of order @xmath86 ( or more conservatively , bounded by @xmath87 ) .",
    "we have verified this approximate law by calculating the coefficients using a rescaled temperature and undoing this rescaling after the calculation .",
    "we chose the rescaling factor to be 0.8482 .",
    "the rescaled critical temperature is then approximately 1 .",
    "this prevents the appearance of small numbers in the calculation .",
    "if all the calculations could be performed exactly , we would obtain the same results as with the original method .",
    "however , for calculations with finite precision , the two calculations have independent round - off errors .",
    "the difference between the coefficients obtained with the two procedures is shown in fig . 1 and is compatible with the approximate law .",
    "from this , we conclude that for @xmath88 , the errors on the coefficients should not exceed @xmath89 .",
    "we are now left with the task of estimating the effects that the errors on the @xmath90 have on @xmath36 . in general",
    ", @xmath36 is a function of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the numerical values of the derivative of @xmath36 with respect with these four variables are shown in fig . 2 for a ising measure .",
    "there is clearly a large amplification factor . from our upper bound on the errors on the coefficients ,",
    "we conclude that the errors on the @xmath36 should be less than @xmath93 and will not play any role in the following .",
    "we have found independent checks of our error estimates .",
    "first , the smoothness of the data for the @xmath36 rules out numerical fluctuations which would be visible on graphs . the size of the data for the calculations with a landau - ginzburg measure allows a visual resolution of the order between @xmath94 and @xmath93 .",
    "second , we have calculated @xmath36 in the gaussian case where non - zero results are of purely numerical origin .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "it shows that the numerical fluctuations for the gaussian hierarchical model are smaller than @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "this small number indicates that our previous estimates are conservative .",
    "the calculation of the large @xmath7 coefficients requires a lot of computing time .",
    "we found that using a truncation in the expansion in @xmath97 at order 100 could cut the computer time by a factor of order 100 while having very small effects on the values of the coefficients .",
    "if we plot the differences between the values obtained with the truncated and the regular method we obtain a graph very similar to fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the differences are less than @xmath99 , which is compatible with the numerical errors discussed above .",
    "the data for landau - ginzburg presented here has been calculated with the truncated method .",
    "the form of the coefficients given in eq . ( 3.5 ) involves an infinite number of parameters . in order to see how one can obtain reasonable approximations with a manageable number of unknown parameter",
    ", we will first consider a simple example .",
    "one of the simplest examples of a function with a singularity and a log - periodic behavior is given by @xmath100 this example has been motivated by the calculations of refs . @xcite and the form of the analytic expressions corresponding to one - loop feynman diagrams for the hierarchical model . for definiteness , we shall only consider the case where @xmath101 and @xmath46 are real and @xmath102 .    picking an arbitrary positive value @xmath103 and introducing a new variable @xmath104",
    "we obtain the `` high - temperature expansion '' : @xmath105 with coefficients @xmath106 the critical value of @xmath107 is 1 and is obtained by setting @xmath108 in its definition . using the mellin transform technique discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can rewrite @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 where we have used the notation @xmath112 and @xmath113 the complex part of the exponents comes from the fact that the mellin transform of @xmath114 has poles away from the real axis .",
    "substituting @xmath115 for @xmath116 and considering @xmath117 as a critical exponent , the analogy with the original problem becomes clear .",
    "neglecting the regular part in ( 5.4 ) and proceeding as in section 3 , we obtain the asymptotic form of the coefficients as in ( 3.9 ) , with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 for large @xmath120 , the magnitude of the coefficients decreases like @xmath121 .",
    "one sees that fast oscillations have small amplitudes and vice - versa .",
    "this makes the oscillations hard to observe . in order to get an idea of how to obtain suitable truncations of the expansion given in eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) , we have selected the values @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 and calculated the coefficients with the exact formula ( 5.3 ) .",
    "the sums were truncated in such a way that the remainder would be less than @xmath125 .",
    "we then started fitting the corresponding @xmath36 using eq ( 3.1 ) .",
    "we first used a truncation where the fourier modes with @xmath126 and corrections of order @xmath127 were dropped .",
    "we treated @xmath117 , @xmath8 and the complex number @xmath128 as unknown coefficients and determined their values by minimizing the sum of the square of the errors with powell s method .",
    "this allowed us to determine the order of magnitude of @xmath8 and @xmath117 .",
    "plotting the difference between the best fit and the exact values versus the logarithm of @xmath7 shows oscillations twice as rapid as the oscillations in the fit .",
    "in other words , we needed the @xmath129 terms . with these terms included and using the data for @xmath130 , we obtained @xmath131 and @xmath132 , in agreement with the exact values given by eq ( 5.7 ) and ( 5.8 ) , with three significant digits .",
    "the data and the fit are shown in fig .",
    "4 . in this simple example",
    ", we found that each correction taken into account improved the quality of the fits .",
    "this is related to the fact that @xmath9 takes a not too large value .",
    "as we now proceed to discuss , a substantially larger value of @xmath9 implies a rather more complicated situation .",
    "we now discuss the fits of the extrapolated slope for dyson s hierarchical model . the data is shown in fig . 5 for the various measures considered .",
    "from the equally spaced oscillations in the @xmath133 variable , one finds immediately that @xmath8 is approximately 18 .",
    "according to the exponential suppression hypothesis , this large value makes plausible that only the fourier modes with @xmath134 should be kept .",
    "this simplification unfortunately has the counterpart that for large @xmath8 the @xmath6 expansion is effectively a @xmath135 expansion , as explained at the end of section iii .    to be more specific , the relative strength of the leading oscillations and their @xmath6 corrections is approximately @xmath136 . for @xmath137 ,",
    "this means that for @xmath138 the leading term and the first corrections have the same weight . in the example considered in the previous section ,",
    "the critical value was @xmath139 and good quality fits in the asymptotic region required considering the data for values of @xmath7 larger than about ten times this critical value - which represents dropping only 5 percent of the data . for the hierarchical model , our data is limited to 5 times the critical value .",
    "consequently , we probably need about 2500 coefficients in order to get results as accurate as in the example of section v. despite this remark , an unbiased parametrization of the form @xmath140 gives very good quality fits provided that we disregard the low @xmath7 data ( see below ) .",
    "an example of such a fit is displayed in fig .",
    "the difference between the data and the fit is barely visible for @xmath141 . for @xmath142 - where we do not have any reason to believe in the validity of the @xmath6 expansion -",
    "the frequency is still well fitted but not the amplitude .",
    "the assumption that only the fourier modes with @xmath134 should be retained can be checked explicitly from the fact that the differences between the fit and the data do not show more rapid oscillations ( unlike in the previous section , where the @xmath143 modes were important ) .    if we want to have any chance of using the @xmath6 expansion as a guide , it is clear that we have to retain the data for @xmath144 , with @xmath145 larger than say 200 .",
    "varying @xmath145 and the initial values of the parameters provides a stability test .",
    "it appears that for the 10 parameter fits mentioned above or their restriction to the 8 parameter case where all the phases of the oscillatory terms are taken equal , the values of the fitted parameters depend sensitively on the value of @xmath145 and on the initial values . in particular , it makes no sense to check if the independent parameters satisfy relations dictated by the analysis of section 3 .",
    "we have nevertheless been able to design a stable procedure with less parameters . to assess the stability",
    ", we vary @xmath145 between 200 and 400 , keeping @xmath146 at 800 .",
    "the upper value of @xmath145 is chosen in such a way that we have at least two complete oscillations .",
    "we first set @xmath147 and @xmath148 equal to zero , which yields a parametrization of @xmath36 as in eq .",
    "these restricted fits do not suffer from the sensitive dependence mentioned above .",
    "we then analyze the errors as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "in all the cases considered , the difference between the fit and the data is much smaller than the amplitude of the oscillations ( for @xmath149 ) and can be approximated by a constant plus a negative power of @xmath7 .",
    "putting together the fit of the extrapolated slope and the fit of the differences , we were able to obtain 6 parameter fits with a good stability and small systematic errors in @xmath0 .",
    "we now discuss the two cases separately .    in the ising case ,",
    "the decay of the oscillations controlled by @xmath150 in the 5 parameter fit and the decay of the errors are both approximately @xmath151 .",
    "we thus decided to use eq.(6.1 ) with @xmath152 and @xmath148 equal to zero ( making @xmath153 and @xmath154 irrelevant ) .",
    "the 6 parameter fits so obtained are then reasonably stable under small changes in @xmath145 ( see figs .",
    "8 and 9 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a systematic tendency can be observed : when @xmath145 is varied between 200 and 400 , @xmath155 evolves slowly from 0.67 to 0.57 .",
    "it is conceivable that if we had data at larger @xmath7 , @xmath155 would evolve toward its expected value 0.46 .    in the landau - ginzburg case ,",
    "the value of @xmath155 obtained from the 5 parameter fits is very small and the amplitude is in first approximation constant .",
    "we thus set @xmath156 and @xmath148 equal to zero while @xmath152 parametrizes the amplitude of the oscillations and @xmath157 corrects the systematic errors .",
    "the power @xmath155 does not have the smooth behavior under a change of @xmath145 it had in the ising case , however it does the job that it is required to do : the errors are small and do not show any kind or tilt or period doubling .",
    "these errors are displayed on fig .",
    "their order of magnitude is @xmath94 , which can be used as a rough estimate of our systematic errors .",
    "statistical errors due to the round - off errors are visible on the right part of the graph and clearly smaller by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the estimation of the most important quantities ( @xmath0 and @xmath9 ) from these fits .",
    "the values of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath145 are displayed in fig .",
    "the mean values are 1.3023 in the ising case and 1.2998 ( 1.2978 ) in the landau - ginzburg case with @xmath158 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we conclude that @xmath159 with a systematic error of the order of @xmath160 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , a precise estimation of the subleading exponents seems difficult .",
    "our results can be compared with those obtained from the @xmath1-expansion@xcite , namely @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "these results imply @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we have checked these results with methods which do not rely on the @xmath2-expansion or expansions in the renormalized coupling constants .",
    "first , we have adapted a numerical method discussed in refs.@xcite to the case of the hierarchical model .",
    "we obtained @xmath165 .",
    "second , we have used a truncated and rescaled@xcite version of eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) which corresponds to the usual renormalization group transformation . using fixed values of beta and retaining only terms of order up to @xmath166 at each step of the calculation",
    ", we were able to determine the fixed point and the linearized renormalization group transformation in this 14 dimensional subspace .",
    "diagonalizing this matrix , we found @xmath165 and @xmath167 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath0 is 1.302 . for both methods ,",
    "the errors can be estimated by comparing the linearizations obtained for successive iterations near the fixed point .",
    "the order of magnitude of these errors is 0.001 in both cases . as a by - product",
    ", we also found that all the other eigenvalues were ( robustly ) real , ruling out the possibility of complex eigenvalues .",
    "we now consider the values of @xmath9 . a distinct signature of the  second possibility \" discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite is the relation @xmath168 this relation is well - obeyed by the a - priori independent quantities used in the fits as shown in fig .",
    "we have thus succeeded in finding a theoretical framework in which the new and existing results appear compatible within errors of the order of 0.002 . in addition , we also have a qualitative understanding of the behavior of the extrapolated slope in the low @xmath7 region .",
    "many questions remain to be answered .",
    "first , we would like to understand the origin of the oscillations . if the example of the solvable ising hierarchical lattice models can be used as a guide , the oscillations are due to poles of the mellin transform located away from the real axis .",
    "these poles are related to an accumulation of singularities at the critical point .",
    "we have tried to get an indication that a similar mechanism would be present for the models considered here . as a first step",
    ", we have calculated the expansion of the partition function about @xmath169 , a good estimate@xcite of the critical temperature .",
    "we have carried the expansion up to order 10 for @xmath11 sites with @xmath170 to 12 .",
    "the zeros are displayed in fig .",
    "it appears that the approximate half - circle on which they lay shrinks around the critical point when the volume increases .",
    "it is not clear that the polynomial expansion is a good approximation .",
    "this could in principle be checked by searching for the exact zeros .",
    "however , this is a much harder calculation because due to the existence of couplings of different strengths , the partition function can not be written as a polynomial in a single variable of the form @xmath171 .    the existence of log - periodic corrections to a singular behavior seems to be a feature of hierarchically organized systems .",
    "empirical observations of such a phenomena have been suggested as a possible way to predict the occurrence of earthquakes@xcite and stock market crashes@xcite .",
    "are similar phenomena present for translationally invariant models with nearest neighbor interactions ? using the longest series available@xcite for a nearest neighbor model , namely the two - dimensional ising model on a square lattice we found no clear evidence for regular log - periodic oscillations comparable to those seen in fig .",
    "5 . however , the situation is complicated by the existence an antiferromagnetic point at @xmath172 .",
    "we used an euler transformation as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite to eliminate this problem and found no indications of oscillations having a period that increases with @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane have been studied @xcite extensively .",
    "the zeros appear on two circles in the @xmath173 plane , one of them going through the ferromagnetic critical point .",
    "thus it seems incorrect to conclude that any accumulation of singularities will create oscillations .",
    "approximate calculations of the mellin transform of the susceptibility of the two - dimensional ising model could shed some light on this question .",
    "we also would like to be able to calculate the amplitudes of oscillation with a method independent of the high - temperature expansion .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the study of the linearized renormalization group transformation does not provide any indications concerning the oscillations .",
    "up to now the",
    "_ global _ properties of the flows are only accessible through numerical approaches . the results presented here should be seen as an encouragement to develop and test global approaches to the renormalization group flows .",
    "we thank v.g.j .",
    "rodgers for his help regarding computational problems .",
