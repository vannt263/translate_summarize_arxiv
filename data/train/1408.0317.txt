    "the multifractional brownian motion ( mbm ) has been independently introduced by @xcite and @xcite as a natural extension of the well - known fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .",
    "the main idea behind these two works was to drop the stationary assumption on the process , and allow the hurst exponent to change as time passes . in this way",
    ", the mbm is parametrized by a function @xmath0 , usually continuous , and happens to be an interesting stochastic model for non - stationary phenomena ( e.g. signal processing , traffic on internet , terrain modelling ,   ) .",
    "since its introduction , several authors have investigated sample path properties of the mbm .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite have respectively studied the law of iterated logarithm and the hlder regularity of its trajectories . in the latter , the box and hausdorff dimensions of the graph",
    "have also been determined . moreover ,",
    "the fine covariance structure have been analysed and refined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . finally , the local time and the hausdorff dimension of the level sets have recently been considered by @xcite .",
    "several multiparameter extensions , which generalise the classic lvy fractional brownian motion and fractional brownian sheet , have also been introduced and investigated by @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fine geometric properties obtained in the aforementioned works usually rely on a key assumption @xmath1 on the hurst function : @xmath2 owing to this hypothesis , the study of the @xmath1-mbm is usually easier and leads to results closely related to their counterparts on fractional brownian motion .",
    "this structure of the mbm is due to the form of its covariance which , under @xmath1 , is locally equivalent to fbm s one with hurst exponent @xmath3 : @xmath4 } } \\asymp { \\lvertu - v\\rvert}^{2h(t)},\\ ] ] for any @xmath5 .",
    "the study of the more general multifractional brownian motion , i.e. when the assumption @xmath1 does not hold , has only been recently considered by @xcite and @xcite . both have investigated the hlder regularity of the sample paths , and more precisely the pointwise and local hlder exponents , which are defined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 these two exponents aim to characterise the local hlder behaviour of the trajectories at @xmath8 , by respectively comparing its oscillations to a power of @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that a fractional brownian motion @xmath11 satisfies with probability one and for all @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the general form of the hlder regularity of the multifractional brownian motion has first been obtained by @xcite , proving that for all @xmath14 @xmath15 the previous result only holds for a fixed @xmath16 , and thus not uniformly on the sample paths .",
    "we also note that the geometric properties of a generic mbm are not a simple extension of those on fbm , but display a more complicated structure where the fine geometry of the hurst function intervene .",
    "@xcite has recently extended this study , obtaining a uniform characterisation of the local hlder exponent and proving that its pointwise exponent can behave randomly as time passes .",
    "the resulting process , with unusual sample path properties , is sometimes called the _ irregular multifractional brownian motion _ in the literature . the main goal of this work is therefore to push further the study of this irregular mbm . in section  [ sec : mbm_representation ] , we first discuss the existence of an alternative deterministic representation of the fractional brownian field , which will then be used to study more precisely the geometric properties of the mbm .",
    "section  [ sec : mbm_regularity ] is devoted to the 2-microlocal and hlder regularity of the trajectories ( theorem  [ th:2ml_mbm ] and proposition  [ prop : pointwise_mbm ] ) , and therefore extends the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hausdorff and box dimensions of the graph , and images of fractal sets , are investigated in section  [ sec : mbm_dimension ] ( theorems  [ th : mbm_dim_box ] , [ th : mbm_dim_haus ] and [ th : mbm_dim_images ] ) , where further connections with the geometry of the hurst function are presented .",
    "appendix  [ sec : mbm_appendix ] gathers a few deterministic results related to the 2-microlocal frontier and the fractal dimensions which are used along this work .",
    "finally , several examples are also given in these different sections to illustrate the main results and some particular aspects of the geometry of the irregular multifractional brownian motion .",
    "the question of the equivalence of the different mbm representations is known to be non - trivial .",
    "on one side , @xcite have introduced the mbm as the following stochastic integral @xmath17 } { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm d}\\xspace}w_u.\\ ] ] whereas on the other hand , @xcite have considered a real - harmonizable definition : @xmath18 @xcite have proved that the covariance structure is slightly different between these two definitions .",

    "the equality in law between the two processes can be obtained more directly using theorem 4.1 from @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , proposition  [ prop : rep_fgf_balanced2 ] indicates precisely how these two fractional brownian fields are related , and proves that the well - balanced one is simply a classic field with a change of brownian motion .",
    "besides , this statement allows us to simply the study of the sample path properties of the mbm since we do not need to consider separately the specific well - balanced case @xmath70 .",

    "the local parabolic hausdorff dimension @xmath467 might not seem to be a very intuitive notion at first . to have a better intuition of the result described in theorem  [ th : mbm_dim_images ] ,",
    "we may first note , similarly to theorem  [ th : mbm_dim_haus ] , it does not contradict equation   in the case of an @xmath1-multifractional brownian motion . indeed , when @xmath468 , due to the property of the parabolic metric @xmath360 , it is completely equivalent to cover @xmath447 and @xmath469 in the neighbourhood of @xmath8 .",

    "the other side inequality is simply obtained by observing that @xmath479 , inducing the upper bound using classic covering arguments .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath480    for the second example , we consider the set @xmath481 , which might be assumed to be non - empty . @xcite have proved that @xmath482 . in this case , as the hurst function @xmath140 is constant on the set @xmath447 , we easily prove that the dimension of @xmath469 is characterised by the dimension on @xmath447 .",
    "therefore , @xmath483    the two previous examples show that the estimate obtained in theorem  [ th : mbm_dim_images ] can lead to very different results , depending on the properties of the set @xmath447 chosen . in particular , we observe that the hausdorff geometry of images displays a richer structure than the local hlder regularity . indeed , in the irregular case , we know that the later only depends on @xmath110 sample path properties , whereas equations and show a more complex geometry of the image @xmath446 . in the first case , we observe that the formula depends only on the local exponent of @xmath140 and the hausdorff dimension of @xmath447 , whereas in the second one , equation presents a case where the hausdorff dimension follows the classic formula , even though the mbm is irregular at @xmath8 .    to conclude this section , we discuss the question of obtaining the hausdorff dimension of the level sets @xmath484 .",
    "this problem has already been investigated by @xcite for the @xmath1-multifractional brownian motion , proving in particular that for all @xmath5 , @xmath485 it is quite natural to wonder if the previous result can be extended to the irregular mbm .",

    "we easily obtain bounds for all @xmath5 , @xmath486 lower and upper bounds are not equal in the irregular case , and the remaining question is whether the lower one can be improved .",
    "the sketch of the proof of this inequality is rather classic and relies on the study of the hlder continuity of the local time ( see e.g. the seminal works of @xcite and @xcite on the subject ) .",
    "the key point to prove the hlder regularity is a property called the _ local nondeterminism ( lnd)_. in the case of the mbm , it states that for every @xmath487 , there exists @xmath488 such that for all @xmath489 @xmath490 to obtain a better lower bound for the local dimension of the level set , we would need to improve the exponent in the right term .",
    "unfortunately , the next lemma proves that it is optimal under a mild assumption on the hurst function .",

    "hence , the classic exponent @xmath503 in the lnd property of the mbm is most of the time optimal .",
    "intuitively , it can be understood as following : in the neighbourhood of @xmath8 , the hurst function can influence the hlder regularity , but is still a deterministic component and thus does not bring any randomness which could increase the conditional variance .",
    "as the consequence , the latter is only a result of the local fbm form of the multifractional brownian motion .",
    "therefore , the estimate of the hausdorff dimension of the level sets can not be improved using the classic methods based on the lnd property , and it remains an open question to determine the precise form of the fractal dimension in terms of the geometric properties of the hurst function @xmath140 .",
    "we gather in the appendix a few deterministic properties related to 2-microlocal analysis and local graph dimensions and which have been used through the paper .",
