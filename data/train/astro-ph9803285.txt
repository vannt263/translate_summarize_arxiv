    "refsdal ( 1964a 1964b 1966 ) outlined a method for determining a global value for the hubble constant by measuring the light travel delay between different images of a gravitationally lensed system . together with a model that describes the gravitational potential of the lens",
    ", the time delay defines the geometrical dimensions of the lens system and therefore may lead to the determination of the hubble constant .",
    "the criteria that make a gravitational lens system ( gls ) suitable for measuring the hubble constant can be summarized as follows : ( a ) the sky positions and redshifts of the lens and of the images of the lensed object should be measurable accurately ; ( b ) the mass distribution of the lens should be subject to accurate and reliable estimation . when the lens has multiple components , as for q0957 + 561 , this estimation becomes especially difficult and benefits from many different types of observations and also from many and extended images , such as rings .",
    "for example , if the types of observations include radio and optical emission lines , which are less sensitive to microlensing , flux ratio measurements are more useful in constraining the lens model ; and ( c ) the differences in propagation time from the lensed object to us through ( at least two ) different images ( `` time delay '' ) should be measurable with high accuracy .",
    "the source , i.e. , the lensed object , must therefore be variable on time scales far shorter than the time delays , to allow accurate estimates to be made of the latter .",
    "several potential candidates for determining @xmath7 are the quasar q0957 + 561 with two images and a measured time delay of 1.1 years ( pelt et al .",
    "1996 ; haarsma et al . 1997 ; kundi et al .",
    "1997 ) , the quadruple image system pg 1115 + 080 with a measured time delay between components b and c of about 25 days ( schechter et al . 1997 ; bar - kana 1997 ) , and b0218 + 357 with a time delay of 12 @xmath8 3 days ( geiger & schneider 1996 ; corbett et al .",
    "1996 ) . combining measured time delays with a detailed lensing model , refsdal",
    "s suggestion has been applied to q0957 + 561 ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1991 ; grogin & narayan 1996 , hearafter gn ) and pg1115 + 080 ( keeton & kochanek 1997 ) .    in this paper we focus on a study of the properties of q0957 + 561 ( walsh , carswell & weyman 1979 ) , one of the most extensively studied lensing systems which has been monitored since its discovery in both the optical and radio ( see , for example , schild & thomson 1995 ; vanderriest et al .",
    "1989 ; haarsma et al .",
    "the primary lensing components are an elliptical cd galaxy at a redshift of 0.355 , usually referred to as the g1 galaxy , a cluster of galaxies containing the g1 galaxy , and a group of galaxies at a redshift of 0.5 .",
    "the most thorough optical spectroscopic and photometric study to date of the field around q0957 + 561 has been presented by angonin - willaime , soucail , & vanderriest ( 1994 ) .",
    "one of the major concerns in modeling q0957 + 561 is a mass sheet degeneracy which arises from the presence of the cluster of galaxies at z=0.36 . in particular",
    "if one were to modify the assumed radial mass density profile @xmath9 of the lens to @xmath10 + ( 1 - @xmath11 ) , where 1 - @xmath11 represents a constant surface mass density sheet term , then the new mass distribution would also satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "however the resulting value for @xmath7 would be scaled by the constant 1 - @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath11 must always be positive one may always determine an upper limit on the hubble constant for @xmath11 = 0 ( falco et al .",
    "1991 ) .    as also noted by falco et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and later gn , this degeneracy may be broken if one were to measure the velocity dispersion or total mass distribution of either the cluster of galaxies or the principal lensing galaxy g1 .",
    "recently falco et al . (",
    "1997 ) have obtained a velocity dispersion for the central lens galaxy g1 of @xmath12 km s@xmath6 or @xmath13 km s@xmath6 depending on the interpretation of the spectroscopic slit data .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on improving the cluster model and we present an estimate of the total mass of this lensing cluster of galaxies through x - ray measurements of thermal emission from the intracluster gas . in section 2",
    "we describe the spatial analysis of the x - ray data of q0957 + 561 obtained from several rosat hri observations and we present an estimate for the convergence parameter @xmath9 of the cluster .",
    "section 3 describes the spectroscopic analysis of rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and asca gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) x - ray observations at different epochs in order to investigate the variability of different spectral components , and presents various scenarios to explain the observed variability in the x - ray flux .",
    "finally section 4 presents our conclusions from the analysis of the x - ray observations of the q0957 + 561 gl system .",
    "in particular , we discuss how our results allow bounds to be placed on the hubble constant , albeit with these bounds still subject to systematic errors that we can not yet evaluate accurately .",
    "the limits on the mass and luminosity of the cluster of galaxies that contains the primary lensing cd elliptical galaxy g1 presented in chartas et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were based on the rosat hri observation of q0957 + 561 from 1992 may 1 .",
    "we now estimate the mass and luminosity of this cluster utilizing additional data obtained from the three subsequent rosat hri observations in 1992 october 20 , 1992 october 22 , and 1994 april 11 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the october 20 rosat hri observation is centered on the galaxy ngc 3079 with the quasar q0957 + 561 located 12 arcmin off - axis . because of the dependence of the properties of the point spread function ( psf ) with off - axis angle , we performed the analysis for this off - axis observation separately and combined the results with those obtained from the on - axis hri observations of q0957 + 561 .",
    "to look for extended cluster emission centered on the galaxy g1 , we first merged the on - axis observations of 1994 april , 1992 october , and 1991 may .",
    "the image files containing the data for these observations were shifted appropriately such that the center of q0957 + 561 image b from each observation was co - aligned .",
    "the shifts were relatively small , of the order of a few arcsecs .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting merged image of the three hri observations .",
    "x - ray emission surrounding the lensed images can be seen . to determine the significance of this extended emission and whether it originates from hot cluster gas emission or from the psf wings of the lensed images , we searched for a statistically significant excess in detected counts originating from cluster emission around the g1 galaxy .",
    "in particular we determined the number of counts within annuli of inner radii ranging from 15@xmath14 to 100@xmath14 in steps of 5@xmath14 and outer radius of 120@xmath14 centered on q0957 + 561 for the merged rosat hri observations and separately for the off - axis observation .",
    "the background was taken from an annulus of inner and outer radii of 340@xmath14 and 460@xmath14 .",
    "for inner radii less than about 25@xmath14 the contribution from the psf s of images a and b of q0957 + 561 is significant whereas for inner radii greater than about 60@xmath14 the signal to noise drops considerably leading to a large uncertainty in the determined source counts , as seen in figure 2 .",
    "we modeled two point sources at quasar image locations a and b. each modeled source psf was normalized such that the number of counts within a radius of 3@xmath14 from the center of the modeled source was equal to the number of counts within a radius of 3@xmath14 of the observed source .",
    "the net counts @xmath15 detected by the rosat hri originating from cluster emission within an annulus of inner radius @xmath16 and outer radius @xmath17 were determined by subtracting background and point source contributions and is given by the expression ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 are the background counts in the annular region @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the counts within the region @xmath20 originating from the a and b quasar images of q0957 + 561 , respectively .    to compute the total cluster counts , we estimated a correction term for the cluster counts beyond the range of the inner and outer radii of the annulus ( as described in chartas et al .",
    "the correction term depends on the adopted value for the cluster core radius and cluster radius . for our calculations we consider core radii ranging between @xmath23 and @xmath24 and cluster radii ranging between 120@xmath14 and 280@xmath14 . for a typical cluster core radius of @xmath25 ( 0.067 mpc , assuming @xmath26 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath27 ) , we find that the number of counts within a 20@xmath14 circle centered on q0957 + 561 is about 60@xmath28 of the counts found in the annulus with inner radius of 20@xmath14 and outer radius of 120@xmath14 , whereas for @xmath29 we find that about 18 @xmath28 of the x - ray counts originate within 20@xmath14 .",
    "no x - ray sources detected within the hri field of view lie within the annuli used as source and background extraction regions .",
    "for the four hri observations of q0957 + 561 with a total exposure time of 85154sec , we estimate that a total of about 300 @xmath8 100 counts ( with the quoted error being at the 1@xmath0 level ) originated from cluster emission and approximately 2900 counts from the quasar images .    to convert the measured hri counts into luminosities we have assumed a raymond - smith spectrum characterized by a temperature @xmath30 , a galactic column density @xmath31 = @xmath32 ( stark et al . 1992 ) , 30@xmath28 cosmic abundances ( see , e.g. , henriksen 1985 ; hughes et al . 1988 ; and arnaud et al . 1987 ) and the @xmath33 - @xmath30 correlation determined by david et al .",
    "the relation between cluster luminosity and temperature for a value of the hubble constant of @xmath7 = 100h km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 is , @xmath34 with @xmath35 = 0.29 .",
    "there is considerable scatter in the observational data used by david et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to produce the @xmath33 vs. @xmath30 correlation .",
    "a recent study however by markevitch ( 1998 ) has shown that the scatter in the @xmath33 - @xmath30 relation is greatly reduced when the emission from cooling flow regions is excluded in the analysis . to derive the cluster mass , we assume a typical density profile @xmath36 of the hot gas ( e.g. , jones & forman 1996 ) given by :    @xmath37    and",
    "apply the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to the intracluster hot gas , which we assume to be isothermal .",
    "the total mass of the lens within a radius r is given by    @xmath38 } } } { \\   , } \\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the core radius of the cluster , @xmath40@xmath41 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , and @xmath42 is the ratio of kinetic energy per unit mass in galaxies to kinetic energy per unit mass in the gas .",
    "the derived cluster temperature depends on the assumed value of @xmath7 and the assumed core radius of the cluster .",
    "therefore , we determined the cluster mass within a radius of 1mpc for a range of cluster core radii and for @xmath7 values of 50 and 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we use the estimate of the cluster mass to evaluate the convergence parameter @xmath1 , the ratio of the local surface mass density of the cluster to the critical surface mass density for lensing .",
    "the convergence parameter together with the time delay @xmath43 of the gls are two remaining principal parameters with the largest uncertainties that enter in the gravitational models recently developed by gn used to determine the hubble constant .",
    "gn obtain , @xmath44    recent deep hst observations of q0957 + 561 by bernstein et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have detected several new features and provide improved positions for the lens components .",
    "in particular the position of the center of g1 is found to lie at the position previously determined by vlbi ( see , e.g. , falco et al .",
    "1991 ) and significantly distant from the position used in the gn derivation of equation 4 .",
    "the previously published estimates for @xmath1 are very uncertain because they depend ( strongly ) on the assumption that the cluster potential may be represented as a softened isothermal sphere .",
    "the velocity dispersion and its relation to the mass of the cluster , the cluster core radius , the cluster shape and the position of the cluster center with respect to the lensed object also need to be known .",
    "the present hri observations provide a partly independent , but still model - dependent , estimate of the total mass of the lens and hence of the convergence parameter @xmath1 through the expression    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the surface mass density of the cluster lens and @xmath47 is the critical surface mass density ( see , e.g. , blandford @xmath48 narayan 1992 ) , the density the cluster must have to produce multiple images if it were the only lensing agent , and is given by :    @xmath49    where d@xmath50 , d@xmath51 , and d@xmath52 are the angular - diameter distances between source and observer , deflector and source , and deflector and observer , respectively .",
    "we evaluated the critical surface mass density for the gravitationally lensed system q0957 + 561 to be @xmath47 = 0.9452(0.9224)@xmath53 gr @xmath54 , for @xmath55 = 0(0.5 ) .    in estimating @xmath7 from the gls , we need to know the cluster contribution to the lensing of the quasar . in this treatment , we linearly superpose the effects of g1 and the cluster .",
    "we first view g1 s contribution to the lensing as producing a pair of images , a@xmath56 and b@xmath56 , as shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the contribution of the central galaxy g1 has been represented by spls and fgs models ( gn , falco et al .",
    "1991 ) .    for the cluster ,",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric potential which produces an outward radial offset of the lensed components with respect to the cluster center ( see figures 4 and 5 ) . to simplify the calculations we incorporate the thin lens approximation in which the cluster is projected onto a plane perpendicular to the line of sight , on the plane of the sky .",
    "to calculate the angle , @xmath57 , by which a ray is deflected by the cluster lens , we integrated the deflection over the entire cluster .",
    "the scaled deflection angle ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) is given by    @xmath58    where @xmath59 represents the scaled location of a projected mass element in the lens plane with respect to the cluster center and @xmath60 represents the scaled location of the impact ray which is deflected by @xmath61 .",
    "the scaled deflection angle @xmath57 is related to the true deflection angle @xmath62 by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an arbitrary scale factor .",
    "if the lens is symmetric around the line of sight , equation 7 reduces to a function of only the radial component @xmath65 , and @xmath57 lies along the radial direction @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66    thus , to determine the lensing contribution of the cluster , we must first model @xmath67 .    from equation 3 , we find that the three dimensional mass density at a radius r can be expressed as ,    @xmath68    this quantity can be projected on the plane of the sky ( normal to the line of sight ) , resulting in the following expression for the surface mass density , @xmath69 , as a function of the cylindrical radius @xmath70 :    @xmath71    where,@xmath72 and r is the radial extent of the cluster .",
    "notice that the surface mass density of the cluster and the critical mass density both depend linearly upon @xmath73 , thus implying that @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath73 .",
    "however , in our derivation of the convergence we infer the temperature of the cluster through an empirical luminosity - temperature relation and therefore our results do depend on the assumed value for @xmath7 .",
    "in determining @xmath67 we have examined a variety of models in which we used a combination of different cluster core parameters .",
    "we chose cluster limits ranging between 120@xmath14 and 280@xmath14 .",
    "we also varied the core radius between the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 and use @xmath7 values of 50 and 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "note that at the smaller radii , the model approaches the limit of a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "we find that the average value of @xmath1 , at the location of the images , varies in the range of 0.07 to 0.21 as shown in figure 6 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds on @xmath1 place respective upper and lower bounds on @xmath73 in accordance with the models of falco et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and gn . for the estimation of @xmath7 we have taken a self consistent iterative approach .",
    "we begin with an initial trial value for @xmath7 and derive the total number of counts and cluster luminosity for an assumed core radius and cluster extent . using the l@xmath76 - t relation ,",
    "we derive the cluster temperature and from equations 3 and 5 we obtain the total mass and convergence of the cluster , respectively .",
    "the gn result ( equation 4 ) provides an estimate for h@xmath3 .",
    "we reuse this value for h@xmath3 to initialize the iterative procedure and repeat it until the value for h@xmath3 converges ( @xmath77h@xmath3 @xmath78 1 ) .",
    "the result is very insensitive to the initial guess for h@xmath3 .",
    "the error for h@xmath3 is calculated by applying the self consistent iterative approach for cluster core radii ranging between 5@xmath14 and 45@xmath14 , cluster radii ranging between 120@xmath14 and 280@xmath14 and changing the mean hri count rate by @xmath8 2@xmath0 .",
    "assuming @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath2 h@xmath3 @xmath4 82 @xmath5 km @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xmath5 mpc@xmath6 for a time delay of 1.1 years .    the effect of the cluster involves a rotation and an elongation of the separation vector connecting the two images .",
    "we may express the deflection angles for images a and b as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , where the subscript on @xmath1 indicates the point of evaluation and where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the angular distances from the cluster center to the image locations of a and b , respectively .",
    "the calculated values for the deflections @xmath84 and @xmath85 are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the fractional elongation of the angular separation of images a and b produced by the cluster potential alone is @xmath86 and the calculated values for the percent elongation are presented in figure 8 ; here @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote , respectively , the vector separations of the images with and without the cluster contribution .    to calculate the convergences , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we use equation 8 with angular distances between images a and b and the cluster center given by @xmath91 = 26.57@xmath14 and @xmath92 = 21.04@xmath14 , respectively , based on the published position ( -13.7@xmath14 , -19.6@xmath14 ) ( angonin - willaime et al .",
    "1994 ) for the estimated cluster center of mass with respect to image b and the measured position of image a with respect to image b of ( -1.25252@xmath14 , 6.04662@xmath14 ) ( gorenstein et al .",
    "again , we use a grid of models in which we vary the cluster core radius from 5@xmath14 to 45@xmath14 and the cluster extent from 120@xmath14 to 280@xmath14 .",
    "the quasar q0957 + 561 also was observed with the _ rosat _ pspc on 1991 november 14 for 19006 sec , on 1993 november 8 for 4972 sec , and with the asca gis on 1993 may 9 for 29000 sec .",
    "a summary of information related to each of these observations is presented in table 1 . the spectral analysis for the 1991 november rosat observation",
    "was presented in chartas et al .",
    "the 1993 november pspc observation was centered on q0954 + 556 leaving the quasar images located at an off - axis angle of about 47 arcmin . for the analysis we extracted the source counts within a circular region",
    "centered on q0957 + 561 with a radius of 6 arcmin .",
    "background counts were extracted from several other circles of 6 arcmin radius with centers located at an off - axis angle of 47 arcmin , equal to that of q0957 + 561 . to model the spectral response of the pspc",
    ", we used the september 1994 pspc detector response matrix pspcb_gain2_256.rmf provided by the rosat guest observer facility ( gof ) .",
    "the spectrum was grouped to obtain a minimum of 20 counts in each energy bin , allowing use of @xmath93 statistics .",
    "a simple redshifted power law plus galactic absorption due to cold material with solar abundances , provides an acceptable @xmath94 per degree of freedom ( see table 2 ) . however , the resulting power law is slightly steeper ( @xmath95 ) than expected for a radio loud quasar at a redshift of 1.4 ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; shastri et al .",
    "1993 , laor et al .",
    "1997 , schartel et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in general the results obtained from the spectral fits to the 1993 november pspc data are consistent with the results from the 1991 november pspc observation of q0956 + 561 . in particular we find in both cases that an absorbed redshifted power law of photon index @xmath96 plus a thermal raymond - smith model provides an acceptable @xmath94 fit to the data and yields values for the fitted parameters @xmath96 , @xmath30 and @xmath97 that are close to what is expected for a radio loud quasar at z=1.4 .",
    "the x - ray flux of the thermal component derived from the fit to the pspc spectrum of q0957 + 561 is about 5 @xmath98 10@xmath99 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath54 , at least a factor of five greater than the x - ray flux of the cluster as derived from the rosat hri observations ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this result implies that the observed rosat pspc thermal component most likely originates from a source other than the cluster ( see , e.g. , chartas et al .",
    "1995 ) .    to constrain the model parameters even further",
    "we performed simultaneous fits to the 1991 november and 1993 november pspc data .",
    "we allowed the normalization of the power law and thermal component of each observation to vary independently .",
    "a comparison of the 0.2 - 2kev x - ray fluxes between the 1991 and 1993 rosat pspc observations of q0957 + 561 implies a decrease in flux over this interval by @xmath100 with the quoted error being at the 90@xmath28 confidence level .",
    "q0957 + 561 was also observed with the asca satellite during a pointed observation of ngc 3079 on 1993 may 9 for 29072 sec . in this observation q0957",

    "the source counts were extracted from circles of radius 3.5 arcmin centered on q0957 + 561 .",
    "the background was extracted from several other circles of the same radius centered at an off - axis angle equal to that of q0957 + 561 , but far away in azimuth . for the data analysis of the gis2 and gis3 spectra we used the spectral response functions gis2v4_0.rmf and gis3v4_0.rmf , respectively , provided by the asca gof .",
    "the spectral data were grouped to obtain a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "the observed rosat pspc and asca gis spectra are shown in figure 9 .",
    "the few source counts obtained in the asca observation prevent us from fitting any complex models ; however , a comparison of the spectral slope of a simple power law model fitted to the 0.5 - 6 kev gis data to that of the slope obtained from fits to the 0.2 - 2 kev rosat data was possible . in particular a simultaneous fit of a simple absorbed power law model between 0.5 and 5kev to the gis2 and gis3 spectra of q0957 + 561 yields a photon index @xmath101 , quite typical for radio loud quasars at z=1.4 ; a simultaneous fit between 0.2 and 2kev of a similar model to the november 1991 and november 1993 rosat pspc spectra gave a photon index of @xmath102 .",
    "this difference may indicate a break in the spectrum at some energy above 2 kev .",
    "alternatively , including a thermal component ( fits 13 and 14 ) results in values of the photon index of the power law component consistent with that for radio loud quasars .",
    "the need for a detailed measurement of the mass distribution of the cluster lens has been emphasized by falco et al.(1991 ) and by gn ( 1996 ) in analyses of lens models for q0957 + 561 that incorporate the cluster contribution through a convergence parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the most important result of the present analysis of the rosat hri data of q0957 + 561 , that we hope will eventually lead to an accurate determination of the mass distribution of the cluster lens , is the 3@xmath0 detection of x - rays from the cluster of galaxies that contains the principal lens galaxy g1 . + as indicated in figure 3 , the uncertainty in our estimated values for the mass distribution of the cluster spans a large range as do the consequent estimates of the convergence parameter of the lens ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the main contributors to this uncertainty are the lack of knowledge of the shape of the cluster , the core radius of the cluster , the temperature profile of the hot gas , the cluster extent , and the location of the cluster center as well as the sensitivity to the value of @xmath104 used for deriving the cluster hot gas temperature from the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the present analysis yields a total cluster mass in the range 1.5 - 3.2 @xmath98 10@xmath105m@xmath106 , and does not include allowances for errors in several of the above characteristics , but does consider the effects of cluster core radii between 5@xmath14 and 45@xmath14 , and cluster extents between 120@xmath14 and 280@xmath14 .",
    "the calculations of the x - ray luminosity were performed for hubble constants of 50 and 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the average convergence parameter @xmath107 of the cluster at the image locations a and b was found to lie between 0.07 and 0.21 .",
    "+ one of the other assumptions in the present calculation is that the temperature of the cluster follows the luminosity temperature relation of david et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for a large sample of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the derived cluster temperature depends weakly on the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "an error of a factor of 2 in the x - ray luminosity derived from the hri data will propagate as an error of about 30@xmath28 in the cluster temperature and about 7@xmath28 ( for @xmath1 = 0.2 ) in the derived value of the hubble constant .",
    "the residual rms scatter in the @xmath33 - t relation along the temperature axis is @xmath108 = 0.104/2.1 according to markevitch ( 1998 ) and propagates as an error of about 3@xmath28 in the derived value of the hubble constant .",
    "our calculations for the deflection angles produced from considering the influence of the cluster alone ( not including g1 ) found the deflection for images a and b to lie in the range of 2@xmath14 to 16@xmath14 as shown in figure 6 ; the differences in these deflections for images a and b are much smaller .",
    "the resulting percent contribution , @xmath109 , to the observed 6.@xmath141 separation of images a and b due to the cluster alone , lies in the range of 4% to 22% .",
    "this range includes only the effects of varying the cluster core radius between 5@xmath14 and 45@xmath14 and the cluster limit between 120@xmath14 and 280@xmath14 .",
    "this result is in contrast with the commonly accepted notion that the large separation of the two images of q0957 + 561 is an indicator that the lens contains a cluster of galaxies . to test the sensitivity of this result to the adopted cluster center position , we computed the cluster contribution to the image separation for cluster center locations within a distance of 5@xmath14 of the location derived from the optical observations by angonin - willaime et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . as expected , when the cluster center is moved closer to the locations of images a and b",
    ", the derived cluster contribution to the image separation becomes more significant reaching a value as high as @xmath109 = 31% for a cluster center at a distance of about 16@xmath14 from image b. + recently the mass distribution of the lens of q0957 + 561 was determined by fischer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on the distortion of background galaxies produced by the lens .",
    "their estimate of 3.7 @xmath8 1.2 @xmath98 10@xmath105m@xmath106 within a radius of 1mpc is consistent with the x - ray estimates .",
    "as pointed out by schneider & seitz ( 1995 ) however , the kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) mass reconstruction technique also is insensitive to constant density sheets of matter .    an interesting conclusion from the mass reconstruction analysis by fischer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is the relatively low value of 5@xmath14 derived for the cluster core radius . the cluster core radius , r@xmath110 , as defined in fischer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , however , differs from the cluster core radius , r@xmath111 , used in this paper and defined in equation 2 .",
    "the relation between r@xmath111 and r@xmath110 is given approximately by r@xmath110 = -0.987 + 0.685r@xmath111 for 5@xmath14 @xmath4 r@xmath111 @xmath4 50@xmath14 .",
    "we will have to await future x - ray observations of q0957 + 561 to compare more accurately x - ray and weak - lens results for the cluster core radius .",
    "+ the present rosat detection of cluster emission suggests that future x - ray observations will greatly add to our understanding of q0957 + 561 .",
    "axaf observations should provide direct determination of the temperature profile , the core radius and the shape of the cluster lens , reveal possible clumpiness in the total mass profile , and ultimately provide a tighter constraint on the hubble constant .",
