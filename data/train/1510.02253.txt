    "the above mentioned model arises after supersymmetrizing the inert higgs doublet model @xcite . the inert higgs doublet model @xcite offers explanation for neutrino masses and dark matter .",

    "some variations of this model are also presented in @xcite . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "gauge coupling unification is possible by embedding it in a supersymmetric su(5 ) structure @xcite .",
    "the origin of the discrete symmetry @xmath5 , which is described above , is also explained by realizing it as a residual symmetry from a u(1 ) gauged symmetry @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the model of @xcite and present the expression for neutrino masses , which arises from two 1-loop diagrams .",
    "we will demonstrate that neutrino masses are tiny in this model if either the neutrino yukawa couplings are suppressed or some certain soft parameters of the scalar potential are fine - tuned .",

    "since these quantities are sum of squares of neutrino yukawa couplings ( see , eq . ( [ eq : s ] ) ) , we can expect that the neutrino yukawa couplings should be in the range of @xmath8 .",
    "we have not plotted the values of @xmath151 , @xmath152 , etc in figure 3 , but we have found that these will also be around @xmath8 . we have plotted @xmath144 and @xmath145 in figure 3 , since these two determine @xmath1 and @xmath153 .    from the plots of figure 3 , we can notice that the values of @xmath145 are higher than that of @xmath144 .",
    "this fact follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : simmnu ] ) , where we can see that @xmath135 are proportional to @xmath136 , which are determined by neutrino oscillation parameters . in the case of nh , we have seen that @xmath154 is greater than @xmath155 by a factor of 3.4 , hence @xmath145 is always found to be larger than @xmath144 .",
    "it is clear from the plots of figure 3 that by increasing @xmath147 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 would decrease .",
    "again , this feature can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq : simmnu ] ) . as explained in the previous section , the square brackets of eq .",
    "( [ eq : simmnu ] ) would tend to zero in the limit @xmath156 .",
    "so for large value of @xmath147 there will be less partial cancellation in the square brackets , and hence @xmath144 and @xmath145 would decrease . in both the plots of figure 3 , it is found that the values of @xmath144 and @xmath145 initially decreases with @xmath132 , goes to a minima and then increases .",
    "the shape of these curves can be understood by applying the approximation of @xmath157 in eq .",

    ", we can understand that the contribution from the first line increases , reaches a maximum , and then decreases with @xmath132 . whereas , the contribution from the second line of the above equation decreases monotonically with @xmath132 .",
    "it is this functional dependence on @xmath132 that determine the shape of the lines in figure 3 .",
    "physically , in the limit @xmath156 , the above description suggests that the right - handed diagram of figure 1 is significant only for very low values of @xmath132 . for other values of @xmath132 , the left - handed diagram of figure 1 gives dominant contribution to neutrino masses .",
    "one remark about the plots in figure 3 is that we have fixed @xmath146 1 tev in these figures .",
    "we have varied @xmath40 from 500 gev to 1.5 tev and have found that the plots in figure 3 would change quantitatively , but qualitative features would remain same .",
    "also , the plots in figure 3 are for the case of nh . again",
    ", these plots can change quantitatively , if not qualitatively , for the case of ih .",
    "for this reason , below we present our results on @xmath1 and muon @xmath116 for the case of nh only .    as described before that our motivation is to compute @xmath1 in the model of @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we have shown that the neutrino yukawa couplings in this model can be @xmath8 , and for these values of yukawa couplings , @xmath1 is unsuppressed . in the parameter space",
    "where neutrino yukawa couplings are unsuppressed , we have plotted @xmath1 as a function of right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "these plots are shown in figure 4 , where we have also varied @xmath40 from 500 gev to 1.5 tev .",

    "the horizontal line indicates the current upper bound on @xmath1.,title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=240 ]    the horizontal line in these plots indicate the current upper bound of @xmath161 .",
    "this upper bound would impose lower bound on the right - handed neutrino mass , as can be seen in the plots of figure 4 . in the left - handed plot of figure 4 , for @xmath146 500 gev",
    ", the right - handed neutrino mass is allowed to be between about 650 to 950 gev . in the same plot , for @xmath146 1 or 1.5",
    "tev , the right - handed neutrino mass has a lower bound of about 1 tev . in the right - handed plot of figure 4 ,",
    "the lower bound on right - handed neutrino mass is within 500 gev , even for a low value of @xmath146 500 gev .",
    "the lower bounds on the right - handed neutrino mass , @xmath132 , are severe in the left - handed plot of figure 4 .",
    "the reason is that for low value of @xmath147 , @xmath144 would be high , and hence @xmath1 would be large . from figure 4 , we can observe that @xmath1 initially decreases with @xmath132 , goes to a minimum and then increases .",
    "for instance , in the left - handed plot of figure 4 , for @xmath146 500 gev , @xmath1 goes to a minimum around @xmath162 750 gev , and then it will have a local maxima around @xmath162 1.5 tev .",
    "the reason for @xmath1 to initially decrease with @xmath132 is due to the fact that the decay @xmath0 is driven by right - handed neutrinos and right - handed sneutrinos , as given in figure 2 .",
    "the masses of right - handed neutrinos and right - handed sneutrinos are proportional to @xmath132 , and hence @xmath1 would be suppressed with increasing @xmath132 .",
    "after that , at a certain value of @xmath132 , @xmath1 would tend to become zero .",
    "the reason for this is that the sum of the two diagrams of figure 2 gives a relative minus sign to the contribution of @xmath1 , which is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : br ] ) .",
    "hence , for a particular value of @xmath132 , the contributions from both the two diagrams of figure 2 cancel out and give a minimum for @xmath1 . also , @xmath1 can go to zero asymptotically when @xmath163 , since in this limit the masses of right - handed neutrinos and right - handed sneutrinos would become infinitely large and suppress @xmath1 .",
    "hence , @xmath1 has two zeros on the @xmath132-axis . as @xmath1 is a continous function of @xmath132 and is always a positive quantity , it is having a local maxima between the two zeros on the @xmath132-axis .",
    "in the previous section we have described about muon @xmath116 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : damu ] ) , we have given the contribution due to additional fields ( see table 1 ) of our model to the muon @xmath116 .",
    "apart from this contribution , mssm fields of our model also contribute to muon @xmath116 @xcite , and it is known that this contribution fits the @xmath117 discrepancy of muon @xmath116 .",
    "hence , it is interesting to know if the additional contribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : damu ] ) could be as large as that of mssm contribution to muon @xmath116 . in figure 5 , we have plotted the contribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : damu ] ) . in the plots of figure 5 , we have chosen the parameter region such that the neutrino oscillation data is fitted .",

    "we can notice that the overall magnitude of @xmath153 is not more than about @xmath164 .",
    "this contribution is atleast two orders smaller than the estimated discrepancy of muon @xmath116 , which is @xmath165 @xcite . from this",
    "we can conclude that the additional contribution to muon @xmath116 in our model , _",
    "i.e. _ eq . ( [ eq : damu ] ) , is insignificant compared to the mssm contribution to muon @xmath116 .",
    "we have worked in a supersymmetric model where neutrino masses arise at 1-loop level @xcite .",
    "we have computed these loop diagrams and obtained expressions for neutrino masses .",
    "we have identified a parameter region of this model , where the neutrino osicllation data can be fitted without the need of suppressing the neutrino yukawa couplings . in our parameter region , the susy breaking soft parameters such as @xmath166 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 need to be fine - tuned . in this parameter region , branching fraction of @xmath0 can be unsuppressed , and hence , we have computed @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the current upper bound on @xmath1 can put lower bounds on the mass of right - handed neutrino field .",
    "depending on the parameteric choice , we have found that this lower bound can be about 1 tev .",
