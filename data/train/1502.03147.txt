    "as wireless networks grow in size and become more and more distributed and heterogeneous , coordination among users and acquisition of channel state information ( csi ) gets much more complicated . as a result , there has been a growing interest in development of interference management techniques that rely only on a minimal level of channel state knowledge at the transmitters .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the scenario in which interference management primarily relies on a coarse knowledge about channel states in the network , namely the `` topology '' of the network .",
    "network topology simply refers to the 1-bit feedback information for each link between each transmitter and each receiver , indicating whether or not the signal of the transmitter is received above the noise floor at the corresponding receiver .",
    "there have been several prior works in the literature that have considered this scenario . in  @xcite , it is assumed that transmitters are aware of the network topology as well as the actual channel gains within a local neighborhood ; the concept of normalized capacity was introduced by characterizing the maximum achievable rate using this channel knowledge as a fraction of the achievable rate using global channel state information . in @xcite , the authors considered a more restrictive scenario , called topological interference management ( tim ) , in which the transmitters are only aware of the topology with no information about the channel coefficients .",
    "it has been shown that if the channel gains in the network remain constant for a sufficiently large time , then topological interference management is closely connected to the classical index coding problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and via this connection , a class of linear interference management schemes has been introduced which rely on the network topology knowledge to align the interference over time at unintended receivers .    in  @xcite , the authors considered a class of retransmission - based schemes that only allows transmitters to resend their symbols in order to assist with the neutralization of interference at the receivers . besides their simplicity , these schemes are robust to channel variations over time and were shown to be optimal in terms of the symmetric degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) in many classes of topologies via the outer bounds developed in @xcite . in this paper , we aim to characterize the `` best '' topologies for topological interference management with just retransmission ; i.e. , the topologies for which half symmetric dof is achievable by a retransmission - based scheme .",
    "it is easy to see that in topologies where at least one transmitter is interfering at an undesired receiver , the symmetric dof is upper bounded by @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the topologies in which half symmetric dof is achievable represent the best topologies that one can hope for ( from the degrees - of - freedom perspective ) .",
    "when such retransmission restriction is not imposed on the tim schemes and the channel gains in the network are assumed to remain constant for a long - enough period of time , the necessary and sufficient condition on the network topology for achieving half symmetric dof was characterized in @xcite . for the case of retransmission - based schemes ,",
    "a sufficient condition for the achievability of half symmetric dof was derived in @xcite .",
    "however , the characterization of a necessary and sufficient condition has remained open .",
    "moreover , it is not known whether or not extending the transmission schemes to any general linear scheme makes the half symmetric dof achievable in a larger class of topologies .    in this work ,",
    "we close the gap in the results on half symmetric dof by introducing a necessary and sufficient condition under which the symmetric dof of @xmath0 is achievable under retransmission - based schemes in the case of time - varying channels ( i.e. , without requiring the channels to remain fixed for a long enough time ) .",
    "the condition is based on a new concept of _ reduced conflict graph _ which is a variation of the regular conflict graph used in previous works .",
    "basically , the condition states that for a given topology , half symmetric dof is feasible ( under retransmission - based schemes ) if and only if the corresponding reduced conflict graph is bipartite .",
    "quite surprisingly , we also show that the same result holds even if we allow for all linear coding schemes .",
    "in other words , we show that for any given network topology with time - varying channels , if we can not achieve half symmetric dof by retransmission - based schemes , then there does not exist any linear scheme that can do so .    in order to prove the result",
    ", we show that when the condition is satisfied , there always exists a set of carefully - chosen transmitters in the network , such that by retransmission of their symbols at an appropriate time slot , we can neutralize all the interference at the receivers .",
    "more specifically , we show that only the transmitters which correspond to vertices in the reduced conflict graph that have no outgoing edges need to retransmit their symbols to allow for neutralization of interference at all receivers . furthermore , through a novel upper bounding technique , we show that if the condition on the reduced conflict graph is not satisfied , no linear scheme can achieve half symmetric dof , hence proving the necessity of the condition .",
    "the upper bound is based on the fact that if half symmetric dof is achievable in a topology , then any pair of transmitters which are causing interference at a third receiver should both be silent for half the time slots ; i.e. , their transmission should be `` physically '' aligned .",
    "we also numerically analyze the half symmetric dof feasibility condition under a network setting that models cell edge users in heterogeneous networks .",
    "we first evaluate the fraction of network realizations in which this condition is satisfied , and show that this fraction is significant for a reasonable range of the number of users in the network .",
    "furthermore , we compare the distribution of the actual user rates achieved by our scheme with half the interference - free point - to - point rates and observe that the gap between them is significantly low , hence demonstrating that the considered retransmission - based coding scheme performs extremely well in neutralizing the interfering signals over time and its promising performance generalizes beyond the dof analysis .",
    "we also illustrate that the considered scheme outperforms interference avoidance for representative example topologies .",
    "it is important to point out that another implication of the numerical results is that even if we account for the interference from all the transmitters ( as opposed to the _ network topology _ where the weak interfering links are entirely removed from the network ) , the coding scheme still provides gains over the benchmark schemes .",
    "in this paper , we study @xmath1-user interference networks composed of @xmath1 transmitters @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath1 receivers @xmath3 . each transmitter",
    "@xmath4 intends to deliver a message @xmath5 to its corresponding receiver @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that each receiver is subject to interference only from a specific subset of the other transmitters and the interference power that it receives from the rest of them is below noise level .",
    "this leads to a _ network topology _ indicating the interference pattern in the network .",
    "we assume that transmitters have no knowledge about the realization of the channel gains except for the topology of the network . however , the receivers have full channel state information .",
    "we refer to this assumption as no csit ( channel state information at the transmitters ) beyond topology .",
    "each transmitter @xmath4 encodes its message @xmath7 to a vector @xmath8 of length @xmath9 and transmits this vector over @xmath9 time slots .",
    "each receiver @xmath10 receives the following signal over @xmath9 time slots @xmath11 where for each @xmath12 such that @xmath4 and @xmath10 are connected together in the network topology , @xmath13 is an @xmath14 diagonal matrix with the @xmath15 diagonal element being equal to the value of the channel coefficient between @xmath4 and @xmath10 in time slot @xmath16 , @xmath17 denotes the set of transmitters causing interference at @xmath10 and @xmath18 denotes the noise vector at @xmath10 where each of its elements is an i.i.d . @xmath19",
    "random variable , @xmath20 being the noise variance .",
    "there is a power constraint of @xmath21\\leq p$ ] on the transmit signals .",
    "the non - zero channel gains @xmath22 are assumed to be drawn from an arbitrary joint continuous distribution .",
    "this assumption is what we will refer to as `` time - varying '' channels . upon receiving this signal",
    ", each receiver @xmath10 will generate an estimate of its desired message , called @xmath23 , based on its knowledge of the channel gains .",
    "the probability of error @xmath24 is defined as the probability that at least one receiver makes an error in decoding its message ; i.e. , @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rate tuple @xmath26 where @xmath27 is said to be achievable if there exists an encoding and decoding scheme for which the probability of error @xmath24 goes to zero as the blocklength @xmath28 .",
    "the dof tuple @xmath29 is said to be achievable if there exists an achievable rate tuple @xmath26 such that @xmath30 .",
    "the symmetric dof @xmath31 is defined as the supremum @xmath32 for which the dof tuple @xmath33 is achievable .",
    "next we will describe the classes of linear and retransmission - based coding schemes .",
    "assume that each transmitter @xmath4 intends to send a vector @xmath34 of @xmath35 complex symbols to its desired receiver @xmath6 .",
    "this message is encoded to the transmit vector @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the @xmath38 linear _ precoding _ matrix of transmitter @xmath39 , which can only depend on the knowledge of topology .",
    "under such a scheme , the received signal of receiver @xmath40 over the @xmath9 time slots in ( [ signal ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 at receiver @xmath40 , the interference subspace denoted by @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43 in order to decode its desired symbols , receiver @xmath40 projects its received signal subspace given by @xmath44 onto the subspace orthogonal to @xmath42 , and its successful decoding condition can be expressed as @xmath45    if the above decodability condition is satisfied at all the receivers @xmath46 , then the dof tuple @xmath47 is achievable under the aforementioned linear scheme .",
    "retransmission - based schemes are linear schemes where each transmitter @xmath39 intends to send only one symbol over @xmath9 time slots , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath37 is an @xmath49 vector . in each time slot @xmath16 , the transmitter is either inactive ( the @xmath50 element of @xmath37 is @xmath51 ) or ( re-)transmits the same symbol ( the @xmath50 element of @xmath37 is @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath49 precoding vector @xmath37 is binary .",
    "if all the transmitted symbols are successfully decoded , then @xmath53 dof is achieved for each user .",
    "in this section , we state our main result in theorem  [ thm : symdof ] and prove it .",
    "we start by making the following definition of _ reduced conflict graphs_.    [ redgraph ] the reduced conflict graph of a @xmath1-user interference network is a directed graph @xmath54 with @xmath55 . as for the edges , vertex @xmath39 is connected to vertex @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) if and only if @xmath57 and the following two conditions hold :    1 .",
    "transmitter @xmath39 is connected to receiver @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   @xmath58 such that both transmitter @xmath39 and transmitter @xmath59 are connected to receiver @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , the difference between the reduced conflict graph defined above and the regular conflict graph ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 2.2 ) ) is the additional condition 2 in definition [ redgraph ] , which suggests that the reduced conflict graph only accounts for the interference caused by the transmitters which are accompanied by at least one other interfering transmitter at some receiver node in the network .",
    "this implies that the set of edges in the reduced conflict graph is a subset of the edges in the regular conflict graph , hence the name `` reduced '' conflict graph .",
    "having the above definition , we state our main result .    [ thm : symdof ] for a @xmath1-user interference network with arbitrary topology and time - varying channels , half symmetric dof can be achieved through retransmission - based schemes over a finite symbol extension if the reduced conflict graph of the network is bipartite .",
    "furthermore , any linear scheme can not be used to achieve half symmetric dof over a finite symbol extension if the reduced conflict graph is not bipartite .",
    "we now state the following remarks to highlight some implications of the result .",
    "[ remk : besttopologies ] as we show later in section  [ sec : analysis ] , the condition of theorem  [ thm : symdof ] for achieving half symmetric dof with retransmission occurs frequently in scenarios of practical interest .",
    "[ remk : avoidance ] it is easy to see that the interference avoidance scheme , which schedules the users in an independent set of the regular conflict graph of the network , can achieve half symmetric dof if and only if the regular conflict graph is bipartite .",
    "since the reduced conflict graph is the same as the regular conflict graph with the removal of edges that do not satisfy condition @xmath60 in definition  [ redgraph ] , there are examples where the reduced conflict graph is bipartite while the regular conflict graph is not . for these examples ,",
    "half symmetric dof is achievable by a retransmission - based scheme , while it can not be achieved by interference avoidance .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : analysis ] that there are many such examples in practical settings .",
    "we now show a representative example where the achieved symmetric dof by retransmission can not be achieved by interference avoidance .",
    "a 6-user topology for which half symmetric dof is achievable by a retransmission - based scheme , but it is not achievable by interference avoidance is depicted in figure [ ex_gain ] .",
    "0.17       0.17    figure [ conf_graph ] shows the regular and reduced conflict graph of this network .",
    "the solid black edges are the edges in the reduced conflict graph and the dashed red edges are the ones that exist in the regular conflict graph but are removed in the reduced conflict graph .",
    "it is clear that the reduced conflict graph is bipartite ( with the two partite sets being @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , hence @xmath63 is achievable in this topology .",
    "however the addition of the dashed red edges in the regular conflict graph removes the bipartiteness property of the graph and therefore interference avoidance can not achieve half symmetric dof in this topology .",
    "in fact , since the chromatic number of the regular conflict graph in figure [ conf_graph ] is 3 , interference avoidance can only achieve a symmetric dof of @xmath64 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the scenario where the channel gains remain constant for a sufficiently long period of time was considered and linear schemes based on aligning the interference at unintended receivers were studied .",
    "it was shown that half symmetric dof is achievable if and only if there is no conflict between any two nodes that cause interference at a third receiver , i.e. , there is no internal conflict within an alignment set .",
    "it is easy to show that the condition in theorem [ thm : symdof ] implies the absence of internal conflicts but the opposite is not true ; this is consistent with intuition as we make no assumption on the coherence time of the channel .",
    "figure [ cex ] shows an example topology in which there is no internal conflict , but the condition of theorem [ thm : symdof ] is not satisfied .",
    "interestingly , we show in section  [ sec : analysis ] that such topologies for which relying on channels remaining constant over time and using linear schemes to align the interference at unintended receivers can achieve half symmetric dof while retransmission can not achieve it comprise a negligible fraction of possible topologies in a heterogeneous network scenario of practical interest .",
    "theorem  [ thm : symdof ] follows from the converse and achievability proofs provided in sections  [ sec : ub ] and  [ sec : lb ] , respectively .      in the first part of the proof ,",
    "we show that if the reduced conflict graph @xmath65 is not bipartite , then no linear coding scheme can be used to achieve half dof for each user by coding over @xmath9 time slots . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is even and prove that @xmath0 dof can not be achieved simultaneously for all users .",
    "we first prove the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : ub ] for any two transmitters",
    "@xmath66 , if @xmath67 such that both transmitter @xmath39 and transmitter @xmath40 are connected to receiver @xmath16 and @xmath0 dof is achieved for each of the messages @xmath68 and @xmath16 , then there exist @xmath69 time slots for which both transmitter @xmath39 and transmitter @xmath40 are inactive .",
    "more precisely , @xmath70 $ ] has @xmath69 zero rows .",
    "since @xmath0 dof is achieved for message @xmath39 , then it follows from the decodability condition in   that rank@xmath71 for almost all realizations of @xmath72 .",
    "because of the no - csit assumption and the fact that the channel coefficients are drawn from a joint continuous distribution , it also follows that rank@xmath73 for almost all realizations of @xmath74 .",

    "consider the case where both @xmath37 and @xmath77 have @xmath69 all - zero rows and the set of indices for the all - zero rows of @xmath37 differs from that of @xmath77 ; i.e. , @xmath78 $ ] has less than @xmath69 zero rows . in this case",
    ", the matrix @xmath79 has @xmath69 linearly independent rows and the matrix @xmath80 has @xmath69 linearly independent rows almost surely , where the indices of the two identified sets of linearly independent rows are not identical .",
    "it follows that the matrix @xmath81 $ ] has more than @xmath69 linearly independent rows almost surely , thereby contradicting the rank assumption .",
    "it hence suffices to assume in the rest of the proof that at least one of @xmath37 and @xmath77 has less than @xmath69 all - zero rows .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath37 has less than @xmath69 all - zero rows .",
    "it follows that almost surely there exists a vector @xmath82 which has more than @xmath69 non - zero entries . since rank@xmath73 , rank@xmath83 and rank@xmath76\\right ) \\leq \\frac{n}{2}$",
    "] , it follows that @xmath84 is an @xmath69-dimensional space that is identical to @xmath85 , and hence , @xmath86 @xmath85 as well . since",
    "@xmath87 is drawn from a continuous distribution and the design of the precoding matrix @xmath77 can not depend on the channel realization and @xmath88 has more than @xmath69 non - zero entries , the probability that @xmath88 lies in a specific @xmath69 dimensional subspace is zero , which is a contradiction .",
    "we use the result of lemma  [ lem : ub ] with the following lemma to prove the converse .",
    "[ lem : conflict ] if transmitter @xmath39 is connected to receiver @xmath16 , @xmath89 and @xmath0 dof is achieved for each of message @xmath39 and message @xmath16 and each of @xmath37 and @xmath90 has @xmath69 zero rows , then @xmath91 $ ] has no zero rows .",
    "assume otherwise .",
    "since @xmath0 dof is achieved for message @xmath39 , it follows from the decodability condition of   that rank@xmath92 almost surely , hence the dimension of the projection of the received signal at receiver @xmath16 on the complement of the interference subspace is less than @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "thus , it follows from   that message @xmath16 can not achieve @xmath0 dof .    now , assume that @xmath0 dof is achieved for each user in the network . we know from lemma  [ lem : ub ] that in the graph @xmath65 , if vertices @xmath94 have outgoing edges to a vertex @xmath40 , then there are @xmath69 time slots for which transmitters @xmath94 are silent .",
    "we then know from lemma  [ lem : conflict ] that if there is an edge from vertex @xmath39 to vertex @xmath40 and vertex @xmath40 has one or more outgoing edges , then in any of the @xmath9 time slots , exactly one of transmitter @xmath39 and transmitter @xmath40 is active .",
    "it follows that we can color all the vertices in @xmath65 that have one or more outgoing edges with two colors , such that any two colored neighboring vertices have different colors and all colored vertices that have outgoing edges to the same vertex have the same color .",
    "a valid @xmath95coloring for @xmath65 is then complete by coloring each vertex with no outgoing edges by a different color from all its incoming neighbors .",
    "since we found a valid @xmath95coloring for @xmath65 , it follows that @xmath65 is bipartite .      in the second part of the proof",
    ", we present a retransmission - based scheme that achieves half dof for each user if the reduced conflict graph @xmath65 is bipartite .",
    "consider a coding scheme over two time slots and suppose that each transmitter uses a point - to - point capacity achieving code and whenever it is activated in any of the two time slots , it transmits the selected codeword and otherwise it remains silent .",
    "the activation of transmitters is determined by the graph @xmath65 as follows .",
    "let @xmath96 and @xmath97 be the two partite sets constituting @xmath65 . if vertex @xmath39 has no outgoing edges , then transmitter @xmath39 is activated in both time slots . for any remaining user @xmath40 ( corresponding to the nodes that have least one outgoing edge in @xmath65 )",
    ", if vertex @xmath40 is in @xmath98 , @xmath99 , then transmitter @xmath40 is active in time slot @xmath16 and inactive in the other time slot .",
    "as an example , for the 6-user topology of figure [ ex_gain ] , the retransmission pattern can be written as follows , @xmath100 each column in   corresponds to a user and each row corresponds to a time slot .",
    "for instance , transmitter 2 sends its codeword in time slot 1 and remains silent in time slot 2 , whereas transmitter 6 repeats its codeword in both time slots .",
    "we now show that successful decoding is possible for almost all realizations of the channel coefficients , and hence , @xmath0 dof is achieved for each user over two time slots . for each receiver @xmath39 with more than two interfering links , transmitter @xmath39 is activated in a time slot where all interfering transmitters are silent , and hence , the successful decoding condition of   is guaranteed . in the example of figure  [ ex_gain ] , receivers @xmath101 and @xmath102 have two interfering links .",
    "transmitters @xmath60 and @xmath102 are interfering at receiver @xmath101 , and hence , in  , transmitters @xmath60 and @xmath102 are silent in the second time slot where transmitter @xmath101 is active .",
    "similarly , transmitters @xmath103 and @xmath101 are interfering at receiver @xmath102 , and hence , both are silent in the first time slot where transmitter @xmath102 is active .",
    "for each receiver @xmath39 with one interfering link , it is either the case that transmitter @xmath39 is active in a time slot for which the interfering transmitter is silent ( as is the case for receiver @xmath104 in the example ) , or it is the case that at least one of transmitter @xmath39 and the interfering transmitter is active in both time slots ( as is the case for receivers @xmath52 , @xmath60 and @xmath103 in the example ) ; in both cases , the condition in   is satisfied .",
    "in this section , we numerically analyze the half symmetric dof feasibility condition in a network setting that models cell edge users in heterogeneous networks .",
    "we consider a large square cell of side length @xmath105 in which @xmath106 macro base stations ( bs ) are located uniformly on a grid , thereby dividing the whole area into @xmath107 partitions .",
    "moreover , there exist @xmath1 femto base stations located randomly in the entire cell area , with a distribution that biases their location towards the partition boundaries",
    ". each macro bs will have a corresponding receiver located randomly inside its partition , with a distribution that biases its location towards the center of the partition and each femto bs will have a small cell of radius @xmath108 around itself , inside which a receiver is located uniformly at random .",

    "we consider the itu-1411 los channel model , in which the transmission loss ( in db ) at distance @xmath32 equals @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the breakpoint distance and @xmath113 denotes the transmission loss at @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 being the bs antenna height , the mobile station antenna height and the transmission wavelength , respectively .",
    "the antenna heights are taken to be @xmath118 and the carrier frequency is set to 2.4 ghz .",
    "we also consider shadowing with standard deviation of 10db and rayleigh fading with parameter 1 alongside the above channel model .",
    "each realization of the user locations and the channel gains results in a specific network topology , depending on whether the interfering signals are received above the noise level .",
    "we study the following questions : @xmath119 how often is the half symmetric dof feasibility condition mentioned in theorem [ thm : symdof ] satisfied under the considered network setting ?",
    "@xmath120 what is the actual rate that each user can achieve ( beyond dof analysis ) ?",
    "@xmath121 what are the rate gains of the proposed retransmission - based scheme beyond conventional schemes like interference avoidance ?",
    "@xmath122 how often can the topological interference alignment scheme of  @xcite achieve half symmetric dof and no retransmission - based scheme can achieve it ?",
    "figure [ frac_half ] shows the fraction of network realizations which satisfy the half symmetric dof feasibility condition in theorem [ thm : symdof ] versus the number of femto base stations @xmath1 .    obviously , increasing @xmath1 results in denser networks , and hence , reduces the probability that the half symmetric dof feasibility condition in theorem [ thm : symdof ] is satisfied .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath1 , we observe that a considerable fraction of the topologies satisfy this condition .",

    "focusing on the topologies in which the half symmetric dof feasibility condition in theorem [ thm : symdof ] is satisfied , but interference avoidance can not achieve it , we can evaluate the actual rate that each user can achieve and compare it with half of its point - to - point interference - free rate ; i.e. , @xmath126 .",

    "the number of femto base stations is fixed at @xmath127 and the macro base stations are on a @xmath128 grid .",
    "interestingly , the distribution of the rates achieved under our simple retransmission - based scheme is very close to half of the interference - free rates .",
    "moreover , there is a considerable gap between the performance of our scheme in comparison with interference avoidance , especially at high rates .",
    "this shows that in these topologies , our simple scheme which is only based on retransmission of the signals has a remarkable rate performance aside from its dof optimality .",
    "we also compare the performance of our retransmission - based scheme with the topological interference alignment scheme of @xcite , which takes advantage of channels remaining fixed over time and uses linear schemes to align interference over time at unintended receivers . for the @xmath129 macro grid with @xmath130 femto",

    "interestingly , we observe that there are very few topologies in which assuming constant channels over time and using linear schemes and alignment of the interference can produce dof gains over retransmission - based schemes and for most topologies , simpler retransmission - based schemes which are robust to channel variations suffice to achieve the optimal symmetric dof .    in order to demonstrate the usefulness of our retransmission - based scheme in another cellular setting",
    ", we also evaluate our scheme under the hexagonal cell model depicted in figure [ fig : hex_cells ] .",
    "this is a typical arrangement of twelve hexagonal cells , each with a side length of @xmath105 .",
    "similar to the previous setting , here there is a macro bs in the center of each cell , serving a receiver located randomly within the cell with a location distribution biased toward the center of the cell .",
    "also , there exist @xmath1 femto bs s located randomly inside the cells , with locations biased toward the cell edges and each of them serves a corresponding user located uniformly within a distance @xmath108 of it .",

    "the distribution of the user rates is plotted in figure [ fig : rates_hex_cells ] .",
    "we have also plotted the distribution of half of the point - to - point interference - free rates as a benchmark .",
    "as the figure depicts , the results look very similar to the case of rectangular cells , therefore suggesting that our retranmission - based scheme can effectively neutralize the interference in the case of hexagonal cells , as well .",
    "in this paper , we focused on the problem of achieving half symmetric dof for time - varying interference networks with no csit beyond topology information .",
    "we introduced a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of half symmetric dof under retransmission - based schemes .",
    "the achievability was proved through a careful design of the retransmission pattern , and the converse was shown for any linear scheme by restricting the silence pattern of the transmitters assuming that half symmetric dof is achievable .",
    "we showed that under a particular configuration for heterogeneous networks , the characterized condition is satisfied in a considerable fraction of topologies .",
    "we also demonstrated that our simple retransmission - based scheme yields significant rate gains over interference avoidance in many network topologies and its gains are not restricted to high - snr analysis .",
    "there are numerous interesting future directions to consider following this work .",
    "an important direction would be to characterize the symmetric dof for the topologies in which half symmetric dof can not be achieved through retransmission .",
    "an important progress has been made in this direction in @xcite in which the linear symmetric dof has been fully characterized for a class of topologies , which includes the topology in figure [ cex ] .",
    "second , the application of the retransmission - based schemes in a device - to - device ( d2d ) network setting can be investigated .",
    "especially , it would be interesting to study how much improvement such schemes can provide alongside with the spectrum sharing mechanisms designed for d2d networks , such as the itlinq scheme proposed in @xcite and the cached itlinq scheme introduced in @xcite .",
    "third , the authors in @xcite have considered time - varying topologies , in which the network topology is also changing over time . extending the results of the paper to the case of time - varying topologies would hence be of particular interest .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to study the effect of cooperation between the nodes in the network ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) on the result by checking whether such cooperation can be useful in further extending the class of topologies for which half symmetric dof is achievable .",

    "<S> we study the problem of interference management in fast fading wireless networks , in which the transmitters are only aware of network topology . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a class of retransmission - based schemes , where transmitters in the network are only allowed to resend their symbols in order to assist with the neutralization of interference at the receivers . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a necessary and sufficient condition on the network topology , under which half symmetric degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) is achievable through the considered retransmission - based schemes . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the `` best '' topologies since half symmetric dof is the highest possible value for the symmetric dof in the presence of interference . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the condition is satisfied , there always exists a set of carefully chosen transmitters in the network , such that by retransmission of their symbols at an appropriate time slot , we can neutralize all the interfering signals at the receivers . </S>",
    "<S> quite surprisingly , we also show that for any given network topology , if we can not achieve half symmetric dof by retransmission - based schemes , then there does not exist any linear scheme that can do so . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a practical network scenario that models cell edge users in a heterogeneous network , and show that the characterized condition on the network topology occurs frequently . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we numerically evaluate the achievable rates of the dof - optimal retransmission - based scheme in such network scenario , and show that its throughput gain is not restricted to the asymptotic dof analysis . </S>"
