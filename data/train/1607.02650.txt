    "their average is 4.96  ps .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding friction eigenvalue , which is a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric sa and is modes only corresponds to a lifetime of 2.5  ps .",

    "comparison to experimental data shows agreement within the same order of magnitude , but does not enable definitive conclusions on the systematic accuracy of the method .",
    "an interesting finding is the intermolecular coupling induced by the tensorial structure of electronic friction , which is critical to understand experimental observations",
