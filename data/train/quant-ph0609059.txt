    "a fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics is the appearance of the wave - particle duality in the latter .",
    "the usual language used to distinguish between the two is that of decoherence - coherence with the former implying a transition to the classical regime . in atomic structure studies ,",
    "the terminology used is that of electronic localization - delocalization , normally employed in the description of electronic charge densities , in the position or momentum representations .",
    "it is thought that the extent of this localization - delocalization behavior is due in part to the effects of electron correlation .",
    "these quantum effects manifest themselves in a variety of physical phenomena such as atomic shell structure , chemical binding and reactivity , and superconductivity in condensed matter systems .",
    "the wave - particle duality in quantum mechanics finds it expression in the heisenberg uncertainty principle , i.e. it is impossible to localize the position of an electron without delocalizing its momentum .",
    "there are various formulations of the uncertainty principle but the one which will interest us here is the information theoretic one at the one - electron level @xcite , @xmath0 in the above , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the unity - normalized one - electron shannon entropies in position and momentum space respectively , defined as @xmath3 } d { \\bf r } \\label{shanr}\\ ] ] @xmath4 } d { \\bf p}. \\label{shanp}\\ ] ] @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the one - electron charge and momentum densities , and both @xmath6 and @xmath5 are normalized to n , the number of electrons in the system .",
    "these densities provide the local information about the system at the one - electron level in each space .",
    "the spin - free one - electron reduced density matrix is defined in terms of the full n - order density matrix @xcite in position space as @xmath7 and in momentum space as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the n - electron wavefunctions in position and momentum space . combined space - spin co - ordinates , @xmath11 , and momentum - spin co - ordinates , @xmath12 , are used .",

    "the off - diagonal elements , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , from the quantum superposition principle , contain information about the non - local or quantum behaviour of the system .",
    "there is also an information theoretic two - electron uncertainty relationship @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are unity - normalized two - electron shannon entropies in the respective spaces , defined as @xmath23 } d{\\bf{r}}_1 d{\\bf{r}}_2 , \\label{shanr1}\\ ] ] @xmath24 } d{\\bf{p}}_1 d{\\bf{p}}_2 . \\label{shanp1}\\ ] ] @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the spinless two - electron densities , in position and momentum space respectively , normalized to @xmath27 .",
    "these densities are the diagonal elements of the spin - free two - electron reduced density matrices , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xmath31 the off - diagonal elements of the two - electron reduced density matrix in each space ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) supplies information about the non - local behavior at the two - electron level . it is natural to examine these regions of the two - electron reduced density matrices if one is interested in examining how the quantum nature of an electronic system is determined or governed by electron correlation .",
    "one can appreciate that although the information is encoded in the one- and two- electron density matrices , it is not an easy task to extract it since these quantities are six and twelve dimensional respectively , in nature .",
    "the localization - delocalization phenomenon , and its consequences , has been investigated at the one - electron level by studying @xmath34 and @xmath35 in atomic and molecular systems upon varying the molecular geometry @xcite or basis set in an isoelectronic series @xcite , and in the progress of a chemical reaction @xcite .",
    "the entropy sum , @xmath36 , has been proposed as a measure of electron correlation @xcite , and has been examined in confined systems @xcite .",
    "this sum and its components have been considered with regard to the complexity in atomic systems @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 has been reported to be discontinuous in the helium isoelectronic series @xcite , and the finite size scaling of the shannon entropy has been discussed @xcite . at the two - electron level , @xmath37 and @xmath38 have been analyzed in atomic systems @xcite .",
    "mutual information in both spaces , defined as , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , have been used to study electron correlation and localization @xcite .",
    "atomic shells and electron localization in momentum space have also been examined @xcite .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the entropic uncertainty relationships [ eqs.([guevara03 ] ) and ( [ bial1001 ] ) ] can be interpreted as measures of local and non - local information and that delocalization of the density in a particular representation , due to electron correlation effects , should translate into significant contributions from the off - diagonal elements .",
    "if this concept could be made more precise , one would be able to examine the restrictions imposed by the uncertainty principle , and the effects of electron correlation , on the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this would provide us with conceptual information on how electron correlation influences the quantum properties of an electronic system .",
    "atomic structure factors are well known quantities and have been studied intensively over the years in position space @xcite and in momentum space @xcite . in momentum space , they are also known as reciprocal forms factors or internally folded densities @xcite .",
    "the spherically averaged quantities are defined in terms of the one - electron reduced density matrices as    @xmath41    @xmath42    or by use of the fourier convolution theorem , they can be related to the fourier components of the respective densities , @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 is the zero - order spherical bessel function and the last equality in the previous two equations is due to the spherical symmetry of the system .",
    "f@xmath46 is obtainable from elastic scattering experiments while b@xmath47 can be determined from compton profiles .",
    "f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 are also known as autocorrelation functions from fourier transform theory , and the normalization f@xmath48=b@xmath48=n is normally used .",
    "we emphasize that autocorrelation is distinct from electron correlation .",
    "one question , which we will address , is : how does electron correlation influence or impact upon the autocorrelation ?",
    "these quantities provide information about the ( integrated ) off - diagonal elements as a function of the distance from the diagonal , and hence the quantum behavior in each representation .",
    "another interpretation is that they are contracted forms of the one - electron reduced density matrix @xcite .",
    "for example , one would expect that a more rapidly decaying b@xmath47 curve would be associated with a more classical behavior , i.e. there are smaller contributions from the off - diagonal regions at larger @xmath49 .",
    "the local behavior of the f@xmath46 curve in atomic systems has been studied along with its laplacian , @xmath50f@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the behaviors of b@xmath47 @xcite and @xmath50b@xmath47 @xcite have also been reported .",
    "the shape of the f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 curves may also be interpreted as the range of the electrons in each space .",
    "a sharply decaying curve corresponds to a smaller range while a flatter curve to a larger range , i.e. a larger range corresponds to a larger spatial extension of the curve .",
    "related to this is the concept of localization - delocalization since a more localized system would involve an autocorrelation function which decays more rapidly while a delocalized system would correspond to a slowly decaying autocorrelation function , i.e. significant contributions to the off - diagonal elements of the density matrices .",
    "such a situation is identified with the concept of off - diagonal long range order which can be described as @xmath51 for @xmath52 large @xcite .",
    "we note that off - diagonal long range order in one- and two - particle density matrices has been linked to phenomena such as bose - einstein condensation and superconductivity .",
    "the question is now : could one quantify the extent of this order , by a simple numerical measure , and hence make its meaning more precise ?",
    "the word @xmath53 leads us to consider the f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 distributions , from which one may use information theory and define entropic quantities to measure the global order or structure inherent in these distributions .",
    "that is , we study the structure or order in the distributions , whose independent variables , @xmath54 and @xmath49 , contain the quantum properties of the system .",
    "we remark that information theory is not the only tool available to study the structure in a distribution .",
    "one can think of others , e.g. variance measures , which may serve the same purpose .",
    "the shannon entropy in information theory @xcite [ defined for the electronic one - electron densities in eqs .",
    "( [ shanr ] ) and ( [ shanp ] ) ] is a measure of the structure or uncertainty in the underlying density and hence its use in the entropic uncertainty relationship in eq .",
    "( [ guevara03 ] ) .",
    "another interpretation is that it measures the spread , or in other words , the range of the distribution .",
    "more structured or ordered densities are associated with smaller values of the entropy while larger values with flatter , less - ordered densities . in this context",
    ", we emphasize that long range order would be equated with disorder in the information theoretic framework and larger entropic values .",
    "we thus define the entropic quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 as measures of the order - disorder in the f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 curves , for f@xmath46 and b@xmath47@xmath59 .",
    "we will remark on this restriction later on in the paper .",
    "long range order ( slowly decaying curves ) should be associated with larger values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 while smaller values with the emergence of a more classical behavior .",
    "these quantities may also be interpreted as a measure of the width of the autocorrelation functions .",
    "we use unity - normalized distributions throughout , @xmath60 the purpose of this paper is to quantify and to examine the order present in the off - diagonal elements of density matrices , by definition and study of the shannon entropies of atomic structure factors , in position and in momentum space .",
    "we are interested in how the uncertainty principle governs the behavior of the off - diagonal elements and the effects of electron correlation on the off - diagonal order .",
    "we use as our test systems hydrogenic and helium ground state isoelectronic series .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper .",
    "we begin the discussion by examining hydrogenic systems , in part to illustrate the concepts outlined in the introduction . for these systems ,",
    "f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 @xcite take the forms @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the nuclear charge , from which @xmath63 and @xmath64 the value of c is @xmath65 and is due in part to the dependence of the expression on the exponential integral . considering eqs .",
    "( [ sfkhy ] ) and ( [ sbshy ] ) , one can appreciate that the z - dependence on summing them would cancel and would thus be constant throughout the hydrogenic series .",
    "we present in figs . 1 and 2 , plots of f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 for some members of the hydrogenic series to illustrate some points .",
    "one notes that increasing the nuclear charge makes b@xmath47 more structured , or it decays more rapidly .",
    "thus , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are being supressed with larger @xmath62 . on the other hand",
    ", f@xmath46 decays more slowly with increasing @xmath62 and one may say that the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are thus more significant in the momentum representation , with larger @xmath62 . in the literature ,",
    "one encounters such results described by the terminology coherence and decoherence , especially when applied to optical systems .",
    "decoherence , in this context , is characterized by a more sharply decaying distribution and accompanied by a suppression of the off - diagonal elements . in the limit , as @xmath66",
    ", this decay becomes extreme .",
    "one should also notice the complementary behavior , i.e. more structured in one space corresponds to less structured in the other .",
    "we now assimilate the structure , or decay characteristics of these curves , into a single global measure , by calculating their entropies defined in eqs .",
    "( [ sfk ] ) and ( [ sbs ] ) .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the members of the hydrogenic series .",
    "one observes that @xmath56 diminishes with @xmath62 ( more ordered or structured ) while @xmath55 increases ( less ordered ) .",
    "this behavior reflects the nature of the curves in figs .",
    "1 and 2 . note also the inverse behavior between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , that is , between the momentum and position space representations .",
    "the result that the sum @xmath67 is a constant for the entire hydrogenic series reflects a certain symmetry between @xmath55 and @xmath56 values . with increasing @xmath62",
    ", the b@xmath47 curves are localized to the same extent that the f@xmath46 curves are delocalized .",
    "a constant entropy sum for the densities has also been observed in the hydrogenic series @xcite , whose value is less than the entropy sum of the structure factors .",
    "it is also instructive to compare these results with those for the ground state of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . in such one - dimensional systems ,",
    "f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 are @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the frequency of oscillation .",
    "the corresponding unity - normalized entropies are @xmath70 thus the entropy sum of the structure factors in these systems is also independent of the potential .",
    "its value , @xmath71 , can be compared and contrasted to the entropy sum of the densities , @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the additional term , @xmath73 , in the entropy sum of the structure factors , is due to the differences in the normalization constants of the densities and the structure factors .",
    "the harmonic oscillator wave function corresponds to the minimum uncertainty one , that is , the lower bound of the uncertainty relationship for the shannon entropies of the densities .",
    "thus atomic systems with coulomb - type potentials have entropy sums larger than the lower bound of the three - dimensional oscillator @xcite . on comparing the entropy sum of structure factors in the hydrogenic case to that of the ( three - dimensional ) harmonic oscillator",
    ", one observes that the hydrogenic value is also larger than that of the oscillator .",
    "this suggests that the entropy sum of structure factors for the oscillator forms the lower bound for all systems .",
    "we next consider the impact of electron correlation by examining members of the helium isoelectronic series .",
    "simple model wave functions may be written for the ground states of these singlet systems as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the normalization constant and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are variational parameters . f@xmath46 and b@xmath47 were calculated by spherical bessel transforming the respective charge and momentum densities . @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56 were calculated by numerical integration . in this series",
    ", the nuclear charge can be thought of as the parameter which controls the electron correlation .",
    "the model wave functions in an isoelectronic series provide a systematic manner of varying the effects of electron correlation . as @xmath62 increases , @xmath78 and the correlation decreases in a monotonic manner .",
    "thus , the more highly correlated members of the series are those with smaller @xmath62 .",
    "electron correlation in this model is purely coulombic since the spatial part of the wave functions is symmetric .",
    "one can also envisage non - interacting ( ni ) reference systems by setting @xmath79 in the above .",
    "such hydrogen - like systems would possess no electron correlation or interaction between electrons and would be a convenient reference from which one could gauge the effects of correlation on the studied properties .",
    "we present in figs .",
    "4 and 5 plots of b@xmath47 and f@xmath46 for the helium series .",
    "one finds that the b@xmath47 curve corresponding to the helium member , the most correlated one , is the most diffuse one . with larger @xmath62",
    ", the curve decays more sharply as the electron correlation is turned off .",
    "the corresponding ni curve for helium decays more sharply than the interacting one .",
    "thus , the effect of electron correlation is to make the b@xmath47 more diffuse .",
    "correlation , in position space , is accompanied by more significant contributions to the off - diagonal elements , or delocalization of the fourier components of the momentum density .",
    "the case of f@xmath46 is opposite to that of b@xmath47 .",
    "the highly correlated ( z=2 ) member is characterized by the most localized curve . as @xmath62 increases",
    ", the f@xmath46 curve becomes more delocalized or flatter .",
    "on comparison to the ni curve , the effect of correlation is to make the f@xmath46 curve more localized or abruptly decaying .",
    "that is , correlation in momentum space decreases the contributions from the off - diagonal elements , i.e localization of the fourier components of the charge density .",
    "one may say that correlation in momentum space forces information closer to the diagonal part of the density matrix , i.e. the momentum density .",
    "the effects of electron correlation on both b@xmath47 and f@xmath46 @xcite , and on f@xmath46 @xcite , have been studied in the lithium isoelectronic series .",
    "next , we show in fig .",
    "6 the behavior of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the he series .",
    "@xmath55 increases with @xmath62 while @xmath56 decreases , showing a complementary - type relationship between the two .",
    "the most highly correlated system ( @xmath62=2 ) exhibits the most long - range order ( largest entropy ) in position space and the smallest in momentum space .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot @xmath55+@xmath56 and also include the sum for hydrogenic systems which corresponds to the non - interacting systems .",
    "the most striking observation is that the curve for the he series is not a constant , as in the case for non - interacting systems .",
    "the effect of correlation thus breaks the symmetry between the increase in the @xmath55 values and the decrease in the @xmath56 ones as witnessed in the non - interacting ( hydrogenic ) systems .",
    "one may also obtain a measure of the effect of electron correlation by defining @xmath80 where the superscript @xmath81 denotes the hydrogenlike value .",
    "our results for all the studied members of the he series show that @xmath82 while @xmath83 and approach zero from above(below ) as z increases .",
    "electron correlation induces a flattening of the b@xmath47 curves and a contraction of the f@xmath46 curves .",
    "thus , electron correlation can be thought of as a coherent phenomena ( larger autocorrelation for larger values of @xmath49 ) in @xmath84-space , while it is a decoherent one in @xmath85-space , forcing the information into regions closer to the diagonal .",
    "one can also consider two - electron structure factors @xcite whose spherical averages are defined as @xmath86 } d{\\bf r}_1 d{\\bf r}_2 d\\omega_{k_1 } d\\omega_{k_2 } \\label{twofk1 } \\ ] ] and @xmath87 } d{\\bf p}_1 d{\\bf p}_2 d\\omega_{s_1 } d\\omega_{s_2}. \\label{twobs1 } \\ ] ] equivalently , @xmath88 @xmath89 these quantities are two - electron autocorrelation functions and provide information about the range as a function of two electrons .",
    "the usual normalization is that @xmath90=@xmath91=@xmath92 .",
    "electron correlation effects on the quantum properties , or range , would be contained in the correlation between the fourier components of the respective densities , that is , between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the behavior of atomic two - electron autocorrelation functions has not been studied in the literature .",
    "we show their behavior in figs . 8 and 9 for the helium atom .",
    "note that the information in the two - electron density matrix of this system resides in regions relatively close to the diagonal , i.e. b(@xmath95,@xmath96 ) and f(@xmath93,@xmath94 ) are small for @xmath95,@xmath96 and @xmath93,@xmath94 not very large .",
    "the same general trends that were observed at the one - electron level are present .",
    "that is , f(@xmath93,@xmath94 ) decays more slowly than b(@xmath95,@xmath96 ) . with increasing",
    "@xmath62 , b(@xmath95,@xmath96 ) decays more abruptly while f(@xmath93,@xmath94 ) decays more slowly .",
    "this is illustrated with be@xmath97 in figs .",
    "10 and 11 .",
    "entropies for these distributions are defined as @xmath98 @xmath99 where the two - electron structure factors are normalized to unity , @xmath100 these two - electron entropies provide a measure of the decay in the underlying distributions .",
    "two - electron structure factors were calculated from eqns .",
    "( [ fktwosph ] ) and ( [ bstwosph ] ) and their respective entropies from numerical integration of eqns .",
    "( [ sfktwo ] ) and ( [ sbktwo ] ) .",
    "one should also consider that in applying the definitions of the one- and two - electron entropies of structure factors , the presence of the logarithm demands that the underlying distributions be positive definite if one wishes the values of the entropies to be real numbers .",
    "we numerically verified this to be true for the studied systems .",
    "there are however , some atomic systems , which have negative regions in their b(@xmath49 ) plots @xcite at the hartree - fock level of calculation . in such instances",
    ", one would have to employ other measures of the spread of a distribution , or re - define the distributions to be positive .",
    "we plot in fig . 12 @xmath101 and @xmath102 where",
    "the same general trends as those at the one - electron level are observed : @xmath101 increases ( disordered ) and @xmath102 decreases ( ordered ) with increasing z. in fig .",
    "13 , we plot the sum , @xmath103 , along with the values for the corresponding non - interacting systems , @xmath104 .",
    "one can see that the difference between the two is largest for the most correlated ( z=2 ) member .",
    "the quantities @xmath105 and @xmath106 may be used as measures of how the range of the electrons is affected by the presence of coulomb interactions between them .",
    "our results yielded that @xmath107 and @xmath108 for all the studied members and approach zero as z increases .",
    "correlation is accompanied by delocalization in @xmath84-space and localization in @xmath85-space .",
    "one may also ask the question : how does electron correlation affect the correlation among the off - diagonal elements of the two - electron density matrix ?",
    "another way of phrasing the question is : how are the quantum properties of one electron correlated with those of the other electron ?",
