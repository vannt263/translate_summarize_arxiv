    "recently , dual transformations in various different forms are playing increasingly important roles in string theory .",
    "historically , one of the first useful examples of the dual transformations was the kramers - wannier duality @xcite for the two - dimensional ising model on the square lattice , which allows us to locate exactly the critical temperature for the order - disorder phase transition .",
    "the familiar t - dual transformation in closed string theories compactified on a torus is basically the same as the kramers - wannier dual transformation on discretized world sheets for a compact @xmath2-spin model ( an xy model with a villain - type action , see , e.g. @xcite and appendix a ) , where the circle as the target space becomes the spin variable and the role of the compactification radius is replaced by the inverse temperature .",
    "a remarkable feature of the string t - duality is that the duality symmetry is exact for any world sheet of arbitrary fixed genus , owing to the symmetrical roles @xcite played by the momentum and winding modes of closed strings . on the other hand ,",
    "the conjectured s - duality transformation of string theory is a duality with respect to the target space itself and is a generalization of the electric - magnetic duality of gauge field theories , exchanging the coupling constant and its inverse as required by the dirac condition .",
    "complete understanding of all the duality transformations , especially the s - dualities , in string theory would obviously require some nonperturbative framework .",
    "the recent developments @xcite of the idea of dirichlet branes in fact suggest that the t - dual transformations should also play some important roles in nonperturbative physics .    in view of this situation",
    ", it seems worthwhile to formulate the duality symmetries in a simplest setting for nonperturbative string theory . only known",
    "effective formulation of string theory which is in principle nonperturbative is the matrix model corresponding to @xmath3 conformal matter coupled with the world - sheet metric . in the present paper , as a simple exercise towards nonperturbative understanding of dualities in string theory , we study the t - dual transformation of the double - scaled two - matrix model which is the ising model at the critical point on random surfaces .",
    "naively , we expect that the model should be self - dual , since the ising system sits precisely at the critical point .",
    "we will in fact argue that the self - duality is valid in the sphere approximation . in higher",
    "genera , however , the duality symmetry is violated owing to the effect of nontrivial homology cycles . here , there is no analogue of the symmetry between the momentum and winding modes which is responsible for the exact duality symmetry in the torus - compactified model .",
    "rather , the dual theory must be described by vector fields residing on links . only in the special case of sphere",
    ", the vector fields can be expressed in terms of the dual spin fields .",
    "another motivation for studying this model is to further pursue the remarkable universal structure of non - critical string field theory @xcite which is relevant in taking the scaling limit and for studying background independence , using both the original and dual variables and to complement the results of the previous work @xcite by two of the present authors .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we first explain the kramers - wannier duality transformation of the two - matrix model .",
    "although the dual transformation of the two - matrix model has been discussed in the literature , we here explain some elementary details of the construction for the purpose of making our interpretation to be sufficiently definite . in particular",
    ", we emphasize that the nontrivial homology cycles generally violate the duality symmetry between the spin and dual - spin variables , since they allow global vector fields . in section iii ,",
    "following the method of the previous paper @xcite , we derive the stochastic hamiltonian @xcite in terms of the dual variables . in section iv",
    ", we proceed to discuss the double scaling limit of the dual matrix model by examining the structure of the schwinger - dyson equations and the stochastic hamiltonian using the dual - matrix variables .",
    "we will explicitly evaluate several lower - point correlators and determine their scaling behaviors . in section",
    "v , based on the results of the previous section , we exhibit commutativity property between the operator mixing and the merging - splitting interaction of the macroscopic loop fields , in terms of both the original and dual matrix variables .",
    "the results generalize those of the previous paper @xcite . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the duality symmetry of the stochastic hamiltonians . we show that the hamiltonians are duality symmetric in the sphere approximation , although they are not symmetric for higher genus owing to the existence of global vector fields on the world sheets with nontrivial homology cycles , in conformity with the discussion in section ii .",
    "section vii is devoted to concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "a , we present a very brief discussion on how the exact t - duality symmetry is understood as the kramers - wannier duality on arbitrary discretized world sheets .",
    "some of the computational details are discussed in appendices b and c.",
    "the partition function we study in the present paper is the @xmath4 hermitian two - matrix model given by @xmath5\\ ] ] @xmath6 as is well known , this represents an ising system on random surface , where the boltzmann factors are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the nearest neighbor ising links , connecting the spin sites with the same or opposite spins , respectively .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath9 for the ising system is then @xmath10 note that the vertices of feynman diagrams are nothing but the surface elements in the standard random surface interpretation and the ising spins live on the center of the surface elements .",
    "hence the ising links just correspond to the propagators of feynman diagrams .",
    "the geometrical boltzmann factor for the elementary surface element is @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the bare cosmological constant . in",
    "what follows , we use the terminologies , ` sites ' , ` links ' , in the sense of lattice spin systems , and ` vertices ' , ` edges ' , in the sense of triangulations of the random surface .",
    "now let us consider the kramers - wannier dual transformation for this system .",
    "a standard way of performing the dual transformation is to first reinterpret the boltzmann factors @xmath13 for the links as those for the dual links @xmath14 by making the @xmath1 fourier transformation as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an overall normalization constant @xmath17 .",
    "this fixes the dual inverse temperature @xmath18 as @xmath19 with @xmath20 for a fixed lattice , the boltzmann factor @xmath21 would correspond to dual links @xmath22 with parallel (  stick \" : @xmath23 ) dual spins or anti - parallel (  flip\":@xmath24 ) dual spins , respectively . in the present case ,",
    "however , we will not introduce dual spin variables for reasons explained below .",
    "usually , the dual spin variables are introduced as the solutions for the constraint for the dual link variables after integrating over the original spin configurations .",
    "the constraints take the form @xmath25 for all elementary ( namely smallest ) closed loops @xmath26 of dual links encircling the spin sites of the original lattice .",
    "the solution for these constraints is locally given as @xmath27 by introducing the dual spin variables @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) at the center of all dual surface elements .",
    "the fixed square lattice with ising spins is then duality symmetric under the interchange @xmath30 .",
    "for the present model , there are at least two reasons that the system can not in general be duality symmetric .",
    "the first reason is due to the nontrivial homology cycles of the general random surfaces .",
    "the constraint ( [ constraint0 ] ) allows nontrivial solutions which can not be reduced to the product of the dual spin variables , owing to the existence of global @xmath1 vector fields , associated with the nontrivial homology cycles . for this reason",
    ", we will treat the dual transformed model by dealing only with the dual link variables without introducing the dual spin variables explicitly .",
    "secondly , the random surfaces of the two - matrix model ( [ twomatrixmodel ] ) are discretized by triangles corresponding to the cubic vertices .",
    "hence the original spin sites have always three links attached . after the above dual transformation",
    ", the dual spin sites can now have an arbitrary number of dual links attached .",
    "for this reason , the critical point can not be fixed to be the self - dual point in contrary to the case of the fixed square lattice .",
    "we can however expect that in the continuum limit this difference might be washed out and the model should exhibit partial duality symmetry in some situation where we can neglect the effect of nontrivial homology cycles .",
    "we will argue in later sections that this is indeed the case .",
    "now in terms of the matrix fields @xmath31 , the boltzmann factors for the original ising links are related to the bare propagators as @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 indicates the expectation value with the quadratic action . substituting the fourier transformation",
    "( [ fouriertransf1 ] ) and ( [ fouriertransf2 ] ) , we have @xmath35 this clearly shows that the dual transformation is performed simply by changing to the new matrix fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which diagonalize the kinetic term of the original action , as @xmath38 whose propagators just give the boltzmann factors for the dual model , @xmath39 the new matrix fields @xmath40 can be regarded as living on the dual vertices ( surface elements or triangles of the _ original _ lattice ) but their propagators are associated with the dual ising links ( dual to the edges of the dual surface elements ) , having one - to - one correspondence with original ising links .",
    "thus they should not be confused with the dual spin variables themselves which are supposed to live on dual - spin sites , namely , the center of the dual surface elements corresponding to the vertices of the original random surfaces .    in terms of the new matrix fields ,",
    "the partition function is ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42,\\ ] ] @xmath43 in comparison with the original representation , this representation itself does not show any trace of possible dual symmetry , reflecting the situation explained above .",
    "this simply defines a mapping of an ising model on random surfaces to a special case of the o(n ) model as has been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "the homological property we have discussed can now be described by the configurations of closed loops formed by the @xmath37 field .",
    "the global @xmath1 vector fields correspond to the closed @xmath37-loops winding around the nontrivial homological cycles of the surfaces .",
    "the @xmath1 nature comes from the fact that even number of closed @xmath37-loops winding around nontrivial homology cycles are continuously deformed into null closed @xmath37-loop . in the case of sphere",
    ", there is no nontrivial homology cycles and hence we can introduce dual @xmath1 spin variables which reside on the domains bounded by closed @xmath37-loops .",
    "the existence of such closed @xmath37-loops winding around nontrivial cycles forbids to define dual spin domains globally .",
    "equivalently , the hamiltonian description of the time development of the random surfaces necessarily requires us to introduce the observables containing odd number of the @xmath37-fields .",
    "let us next discuss the basis of string field representations used in the present paper .",
    "in the previous work , we used the component expansion of string fields with respect to the number of spin domains . in the dual formulation ,",
    "the basis which can be compared with this is the expansion with respect to the number of the @xmath37-fields .",
    "thus the observables we consider are of the following type : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 we note that if we could have neglected the closed @xmath37-loops winding around the nontrivial homology cycles , @xmath49 s with odd number of @xmath37 s were not necessary .",
    "we would then have the interpretation of these quantities in terms of domains with respect to dual spins , and @xmath50 would correspond to the component of the field with @xmath51 pairs of domains .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath37 just represents the domain boundaries of the dual - spin interpretation .",
    "thus , in studying the duality symmetry , @xmath50 should be substituted in place of the observables considered in the previous paper , namely , @xmath52 after an appropriate symmetrization with respect to two matrices @xmath53 and @xmath54 , taking into account the fact that the @xmath50 does not discriminate global dual spin directions",
    ". a detailed discussion of the duality symmetry of the stochastic hamiltonian will be presented later in section vi .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear at least conceptually that the dual transformation is nothing but a change of the basis of the string fields between ( [ originalbasis ] ) and ( [ dualbasis0 ] ) @xmath55 ( [ dualbasis3 ] ) etc .",
    "however , it turns out that performing this transformation directly for the string fields in the _ continuum _ limit is technically very difficult , because the process of taking the continuum limit involves an intricate operator mixing and does not seem to be commutative with the above change of the basis .",
    "thus the question of the t - duality symmetry for the ising model on the random surface is quite nontrivial .",
    "the approach in the present paper will therefore be somewhat indirect such that we perform an independent study of the scaling limit of the schwinger - dyson equations and the stochastic hamiltonian using the dual basis and compare the results with those obtained using the original basis .",
    "one practical virtue of this approach would be that the ranges of the components where we can compute correlation functions explicitly are different from each other depending on different bases , and hence our results are useful for showing the universal nature of the structure of , say , the stochastic hamiltonians , as has been emphasized in the previous work @xcite . presenting such a piece of evidence for the universal structure of the string field theories is another purpose of the present paper .",
    "finally , we here fix our notations in what follows .",
    "as introduced above , the basis operators are @xmath56 .",
    "we denote the expectation values of @xmath56 in the sphere approximation by @xmath57 with the same arguments and suffices .",
    "we have used the notation @xmath58 for @xmath59 in the case of the original spin formulation @xcite .",
    "let us first derive the stochastic hamiltonian using the dual basis of the observables @xmath49 s introduced in the previous section .",
    "the generating functional of the dual two - matrix model is defined by @xmath60 = \\frac1{z } \\int d^{n^2}x d^{n^2}y { \\rm e}^{-s_d } { \\rm e}^{k \\cdot \\psi},\\ ] ] @xmath61 @xmath62 where and in what follows the integral contour , unless specified otherwise , runs parallel to the imaginary axis towards the positive imaginary infinity on the right hand side of all the pole singularities of the observables @xmath63 .    as discussed in the previous paper@xcite ,",
    "the stochastic hamiltonian is derived from the identity , @xmath64 { \\rm e}^{k\\cdot \\psi}. \\label{matrixlaplacian}\\ ] ] the notations @xmath65 denote the components of the hermitian matrix in the expansion in terms of the basis @xmath66 .",

    "are explained below .    1 .",

    "if for the moment we allow ourselves to use the dual - spin language for convenience , this contains a part which measures the number of dual - spin flip links , corresponding to the @xmath37-matrices , in addition to a part measuring the length of each domain .",
    "the other parts describe the infinitesimal motion of string loops , changing their lengths and/or dual spin directions .",
    "2 .   the second term",
    ", @xmath79 , of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) comes from the second derivative of the source term @xmath80 and represents processes where a loop splits into two .",
    "the symbol @xmath81 stands for the spin configurations of the resultant two loops from a single loop with spin configuration @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 here we used the definition of the combinatorial derivative , @xmath86 note also that the last term of ( [ dualsplit ] ) is absent for @xmath87 .",
    "the third term @xmath88 comes from the square of the first derivative of the source term , and represents processes in which two loops merge into a single loop .",
    "the symbol @xmath89 expresses the spin configuration of the resultant single loop into which two loops with spin configurations @xmath90 merge .",
    "the variables on the left hand side of a semicolon represent the variables conjugate to the lengths of domains of a loop with configuration @xmath82 , while those on the right hand side represent the variables with configuration @xmath91 : @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 4 .",
    "the last term , a tadpole term , arises again from the product of the first derivative of the source term @xmath95 and the action , and describes the process of the annihilation of a _",
    "shortest _ loop into nothing : @xmath96    similarly to the hamiltonian of the original formalism , the present dual hamiltonian satisfies a locality property .",
    "for instance , only the loops @xmath97 with no domain boundary can be annihilated into nothing .",
    "also , only a single pair of domains or a single pair of the boundaries of the domains can participate in the splitting or merging processes , and other domains remain unchanged .",
    "one of the differences between the hamiltonians in the original and dual formulations arises from the derivatives with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath98-derivatives produce processes which have no counter part in the hamiltonian in terms of the original variables .",
    "for instance , the last terms of the kinetic ( [ 3.15 ] ) and merging terms ( for @xmath99 ) in the above expressions contain the contributions from the @xmath98-derivatives .",
    "for the splitting interaction , the last ( for @xmath100 ) or the last two terms ( for @xmath101 ) are the contributions from the @xmath98-derivatives . from the view point of continuum theory , these are very singular ; they would be measure - zero contributions . in later sections",
    ", we will show that the terms arising from the @xmath98-derivatives in fact vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "now we consider the scaling limit of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "to do this , we closely follow @xcite . namely , we will first identify and subtract the non - universal parts of the disk amplitudes and establish the operator mixing , and then will rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in terms of the universal parts of the operators .    as we discuss in appendix b ,",
    "the original operators @xmath102 and their universal parts @xmath103 are related by a linear transformation of the following form : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a mixing matrix of upper - triangular form , @xmath106 for @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the non - universal c - number function .",

    "thus , we have @xmath321 + o(\\frac{1}{n^2}a^{-5/3}),\\ ] ] where @xmath322 is obtained by replacing @xmath305 to @xmath304 in @xmath323 .",
    "it can now be seen that the mixed cylinder amplitude @xmath324 of the original theory has the same functional form as @xmath325 of the dual theory , which means the duality symmetry in the cylinder level . on the cylinder in the dual theory , @xmath37-loops along a nontrivial homology cycle can exit .",
    "a natural interpretation is that the amplitude with the even number @xmath37-loops corresponds to @xmath326 in the original theory , and that the amplitude with the odd number ones to the cross term @xmath327 .",
    "this is consistent with the picture of the dual spins .",
    "we can thus conclude that , to the leading order of the universal parts of the disk and cylinder amplitudes , the following identification between the original and dual theories holds : @xmath328 @xmath329 @xmath330 @xmath331 this can be checked for all the disk and cylinder amplitudes we have obtained .      until now , after a long analysis of the schwinger - dyson equations",
    ", we have shown that the t - duality symmetry holds in some disk and cylinder amplitudes without handles , and that it is violated in the higher genus amplitude . here",
    ", we make sure that in general the t - duality is a symmetry in the planar approximation , by comparing the forms of the string field hamiltonians .",
    "then the functional derivatives of the new variables become @xmath342 and the others vanish , where @xmath343 and @xmath344 take @xmath345 or @xmath346 , and @xmath116 represents the cyclic permutations of @xmath347 .",
    "the notation @xmath348 denotes its sign , namely , @xmath349 for even cyclic permutations or @xmath350 for odd cyclic permutations .    by using these variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian is written in the following form : @xmath351 where only even number of the @xmath352-fields appear because of the @xmath1-symmetry of the original hamiltonian .",
    "the above expression shows that if the coupling is rescaled as @xmath353 , the form of @xmath354 becomes completely identical with that of the dual hamiltonian @xmath355 ( [ continuumh ] ) after setting the fields with odd domains to zero .",
    "there still remain the portions that do not match between the original and dual theories .",
    "they are @xmath356 in the original theory and the terms containing the fields with odd domains in the dual theory .",
    "these contributions give no effects in the tree amplitudes when the initial state does not contain the @xmath352-fields , in the original theory , because the vacuum expectation value of a single @xmath352-field vanishes due to the @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "similarly , in the dual theory , the string fields with odd domains never appear for the tree amplitudes when the initial state consists only of the fields with even domains .",
    "thus we can conclude that at the level of the tree amplitudes the t - duality symmetry holds , and that @xmath357 in the original theory are identified with @xmath358 in the dual theory .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the schwinger - dyson equations and the stochastic hamiltonians for the two - matrix model formulated in both the dual and original variables .",
    "we have first performed the duality transformation at the discrete level and then taking the scaling limit separately in both the original and the dual formulations . to deepen our understanding on duality and also to extend our results to more general cases , it is desirable to find a direct transformation of the string fields under the t - dual transformation in the continuum limit .",
    "our two main results were followings :    1 .",
    "the theory in the scaling limit is duality symmetric only in the sphere approximation .",
    "the absence of the duality symmetry for higher genus originates from the existence of nontrivial global @xmath1 vector fields and is explicitly confirmed for the disk amplitude with one handle .",
    "we extended the previous discussion on the remarkable commutativity property between the mixing of the string fields in the process of taking the scaling limit and the merging - splitting interactions of the string fields , by proposing a general rule of the string - field mixing .",
    "the first result , which is a consequence of the absence of the momentum - winding symmetry , might be important in thinking about t - duality transformation in string theory for general manifolds without simple target - space isometry .",
    "if we want to treat the dual transformed theories in equal footing with the original theories as required once we introduce d - branes , this would suggest that the fundamental variables are worldsheet - vector fields or currents instead of the target space coordinates .",
    "also , if we reformulate the original spin model from the beginning in terms of the link variables instead of the site variables , it may be possible to construct completely duality symmetric models .",
    "in fact , it is easy to define such a self - dual lattice model using the same method as a self - dual @xmath359 model as a lattice - regularized version of a circle - compactified string theory .",
    "this is discussed in appendix a.",
    "a difficulty is that such a model in general requires us to introduce both the site and link variables simultaneously in order to include the global winding - like modes before the dual transformation and can not be described in terms of simply solvable matrix models",
    ".    the second result concerning on the universal structure of string field theories might be useful in discussing possible symmetry structure and the background independence of string field theories in general , quite independently of the problem of the operator mixing .    from the viewpoint of our original motivation to the present work",
    ", a crucial question is whether this kind of the formulation of string field theory is really possible for the higher - dimensional models , especially , including supersymmetry .",
    "if we can write down a single hamiltonian which is supposed to govern all - genus behaviors of the theory at once , it would be a promising starting point for studying the non - perturbative symmetries including s - duality structure .",
    "the work of t. y. is partially supported by a us - japan collaborative program from the japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "the work of y. o. is partially supported by a predoctoral research fellowship from the japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly discuss how the t - duality symmetry of circle - compactified string theories is reformulated as a special case of the kramers - wannier duality , namely that of an xy model with a villain - type action on a general lattice . for convenience",
    ", we will use the familiar notation of square lattice , with @xmath360 being the directional difference between nearest neighbor sites along the direction @xmath361 .",
    "note however that the arguments below are valid for arbitrary lattices with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the partition function of the model for a lattice on an arbitrary two - dimensional surface is defined as @xmath362\\bigl ( \\prod_{s , \\mu } \\sum_{m_{s,\\mu}}\\bigr ) \\prod_s \\delta(\\triangle_{\\mu } m_{s , \\nu}-\\triangle_{\\nu}m_{s , \\mu } ) \\exp \\bigl[-{r^2 \\over   4\\pi}\\sum_{s , \\mu } ( \\triangle_{\\mu}x_s - 2\\pi m_{s , \\mu})^2 \\bigr ] \\label{orgpartition}\\ ] ] where the constraint @xmath363 is imposed in order to suppress the _ local _ vortex excitations which are forbidden in the usual continuum formulation of circle - compactified string theory .",
    "the target space coordinate @xmath36 of the compactification circle is normalized such that the periodicity is @xmath364 and the symbol @xmath365 $ ] denotes the path integral with respect to @xmath36 over a single period .",
    "correspondingly , the variable @xmath366 takes integer values , and the radius parameter @xmath367 appears in front of the world - sheet action .",
    "thus , the @xmath368 just plays the role of the inverse temperature .",
    "note also that , after solving the constraint , the integer - valued vector field @xmath366 just represents the winding modes along nontrivial homology cycles for an arbitrary surface of generic genus , since the pure gauge mode of the form @xmath369 is absorbed into a shift of the target coordinate @xmath370 , which in turn ensures the periodicity of the integrand of the partition function after the summation over @xmath371 .",
    "now performing the fourier transformation and introducing auxiliary variable @xmath372 to exponentiate the constraint , we have @xmath373 \\bigl(\\prod_{s , \\mu}\\sum_{m_{s,\\mu}}\\bigr ) \\oint [ d\\tilde{x } ] \\int \\bigl(\\prod_{\\tilde{s } , \\mu}d\\psi_{\\tilde{s},\\mu}\\bigr ) \\exp \\sum_{\\tilde s}[i\\tilde x_{\\tilde{s}}{\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu}\\over 2 } ( \\triangle_{\\mu}m_{s , { \\nu } } -\\triangle_{\\nu}m_{s , { \\mu}})\\ ] ] @xmath374\\ ] ] where the integrals for @xmath375 is again over a single period @xmath364 , while the integral for @xmath376 is the whole real axis . note also that all the new variables are introduced on the dual lattice ; namely , @xmath375 on dual sites , @xmath377 on dual links , and the correspondence between the original site @xmath378 and the dual site @xmath379 is fixed uniquely in the first and the second terms on the exponential of the integrand .",
    "the summation over @xmath380 leads to the constraint @xmath381 where @xmath382 defined on each dual link takes arbitrary integer values . after substituting this result and performing the @xmath36 integral",
    ", we obtain the constraint for @xmath382 @xmath383 whose solutions are again the global integer - valued vector fields along nontrivial homology cycles .",
    "thus , the partition function now takes the form @xmath384\\bigl(\\prod_{\\tilde{s } , \\mu}\\sum_{n_{\\tilde{s } , \\mu}}\\bigr ) \\prod_{\\tilde s } \\delta(\\triangle_{\\mu } n_{\\tilde{s } , \\nu } -\\triangle_{\\nu}n_{\\tilde{s } , \\mu } ) \\exp\\bigl[-{1 \\over   4\\pi r^2}\\sum_{s , \\mu } ( \\triangle_{\\mu}\\tilde{x}_{\\tilde{s } } - 2\\pi n_{\\tilde{s } , \\mu})^2\\bigr],\\ ] ] which is identical to the original form ( [ orgpartition ] ) with the correspondence @xmath385 .",
    "note that the integer - valued vector field @xmath386 , appearing as the winding mode of the dual coordinate @xmath375 can be interpreted as the momentum mode for the original coordinate @xmath387 .",
    "the symmetrical role of the winding ( @xmath388 ) and the momentum modes ( @xmath389 ) for arbitrary genus is precisely the structure of the usual t - duality symmetry .",
    "obviously , the above model can be easily generalized for @xmath390 target space preserving the self - dual structure .",
    "however , it is not easy to construct a simply solvable matrix model corresponding to such a lattice model since it requires us to introduce both link and site variables simultaneously .",
    "here , we obtain various disk and cylinder amplitudes in the dual two - matrix model , by taking the continuum limit of the corresponding schwinger - dyson equations . some of our results have already been derived in ref .",
    "however , for making this paper self - contained , we will give a brief mention also for those results .",
