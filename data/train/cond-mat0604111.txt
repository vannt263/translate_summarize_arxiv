    "macroscopic quantum behavior of josephson systems has been the focus of intense research over the past years due to the potential applications of josephson technology in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "many experimental observations have been conducted in order to characterize and understand the quantum properties of various josephson device and networks @xcite . due to the nature of the josephson effect",
    "it is not easy to make direct observations of the expected quantum states in the anharmonic potential of a zero - voltage state josephson system , so most measurements are conducted statistically by recording the distributions of transitions from one system state to another .",
    "these transitions are commonly induced through the controlled application of microwaves and microwave pulses of frequencies that are commensurate with the expected energy separations between possible quantum levels of the system .",
    "some of the key microwave induced features that have been used to illustrate the quantum properties of josephson systems are multi - peaked switching distributions as a function of bias - point in continuously applied microwaves @xcite , observations of rabi - oscillations @xcite in the switching statistics of systems perturbed by pulsed microwaves @xcite , and the associated ramsey - fringes@xcite when several coordinated and parameterized microwave pulsed are applied sequentially @xcite .",
    "these observations , along with many others , have produced a large body of insight to the dynamical response of josephson systems to microwave perturbations applied at very low temperature , and the acquired data has been used to interpret the quantum nature of the superconducting networks under investigation . however , many of the observations may also be attributed to classical nonlinear dynamics and statistics . for example",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the multi - peak switching distributions as a function of varying system bias for a constantly applied microwave field can be understood as classical high - q resonances in the nonlinear system @xcite .",
    "also rabi - type oscillations in the switching statistics of josephson systems perturbed by microwave pulses have been shown to be consistent with theoretical and numerical expectations based on a classical model of a josephson junction , which exhibit the transients in response to the pulsed perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that ramsey - type fringes can also be observed in the classical model when the recipe of the experimental measurements is followed .",
    "we here , for simplicity , illustrate the results with the simplest possible system , namely a single classical josephson junction , perturbed by a bias - current , microwave fields , probe fields , and thermal noise .",
    "( 12,12)(0,0 )    the normalized classical equation for a perturbed josephson junction within the rcsj model ( see figure 1a ) is @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the difference between the phases of the quantum mechanical wave functions defining the junction , @xmath2 represents the dc bias current , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 represent microwave amplitude , frequency , and phase , respectively ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "all currents are normalized to the critical current @xmath6 , and time is measured in units of the inverse plasma frequency , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the capacitance of the junction , and @xmath10 is the flux quantum .",
    "tunneling of quasiparticles is represented by the dissipative term , where @xmath11 is given by the shunt resistance r , and the accompanying thermal fluctuations are defined by the dissipation - fluctuation relationship @xcite @xmath12 @xmath13 being the thermodynamic temperature , @xmath14 is the characteristic josephson energy @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is thereby defined as the normalized temperature .",
    "a current pulse for probing the state of the system is represented by @xmath17 .",
    "following the procedure of reported experiments , we record the switching from the zero - voltage state ( @xmath18 ) as a result of applying the external current sketched in figure 1b . we first equilibrate the system at a chosen temperature for a given value of @xmath2 . for a randomly chosen , but temporally constant , phase @xmath5 , a microwave pulse with frequency @xmath4 , which is associated with the natural resonance of the junction at bias point @xmath2 , is applied for a duration of @xmath19 .",
    "this duration is chosen to be @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the rabi - type oscillation period @xcite for the microwave amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "this pulse is denoted a @xmath23-pulse due to its parameterization based on rabi - type oscillations .",
    "another @xmath23-pulse , in phase @xmath5 with the first pulse , is applied at a later time with identical amplitude , frequency , and duration ( @xmath24 ) , whereafter a short pulse @xmath25 is applied to probe whether the system is in a high or low energy state after the sequential microwave pulse application .",
    "the probe pulse is parameterized such that a state of relatively high system energy at @xmath26 will result in a likely escape event when @xmath27 is activated , while a state of relatively low system energy will result in a low probability of escape when @xmath25 is activated .",
    "this procedure is repeated many times , each time with a new realization of @xmath5 , in order to generate information about the probability of switching for a given set of parameters , such as the time delay between the two @xmath23-pulses .",
    "( 12,17.0)(0,0 ) ( -0 , -1 )    ( 12,18.0)(0,0 ) ( -0 , -1 )    figure 2 illustrates typical examples of the events described above for @xmath28 .",
    "specific parameter values are : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , which results in a linear resonance frequency of @xmath34{1-\\eta^2}=0.652714 $ ] .",
    "@xmath23-pulses are applied in the intervals @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] with @xmath37 time units",
    ". this value is obtained from the corresponding rabi - type oscillations reported in @xcite .",
    "after the second @xmath23-pulse , a short delay of @xmath38 is allowed before the probe pulse @xmath25 is initiated at @xmath39 .",
    "the probe has linear rise and fall times of 160 normalized time units with a constant value interval of 275 time units .",
    "we show the system response to the microwave perturbations in terms of both phase @xmath1 and the normalized energy @xmath40 , which is defined by @xmath41 figures 2a and 2b show the response for @xmath42 .",
    "it is evident that the first @xmath23-pulse elevates the system energy by leaving the system in a phase - locked state at @xmath43 with energy @xmath44 . at the onset of the second @xmath23-pulse ,",
    "a significant phase - slip between the oscillation of @xmath1 and the microwave has developed during the interval @xmath45 $ ] , and the second microwave pulse therefore decreases the energy of the josepshon system .",
    "the system is left at @xmath46 with energy @xmath47 , which , when the probe field is applied at @xmath39 , results in only temporary energy increase while the probe is applied ; this is not enough to make the system switch into a non - zero voltage state , which can be seen from the fact that @xmath48 for large @xmath49 ) . for comparison",
    "we show figures 2c and d for @xmath50 .",
    "we here observe the same initial behavior , but the application of the second @xmath23-pulse leaves the system in a relatively high energy state @xmath51 , since the phase - slip between the junction and the microwave field is minor in this case .",
    "consequently , the junction phase @xmath1 switches out of the bound state when the probe pulse is applied at @xmath39 .",
    "this is recognized by the diverging energy for @xmath52 .",
    "( 12,15)(0,0 ) ( -0 , -1 )    ramsey - type fringes in the switching probability as a function of @xmath23-pulse separation can be directly observed in figure 3 , where we have shown the variation of the switching probability for @xmath53 , calculated as averages of 2,500 events for different values of @xmath54 and @xmath4 .",
    "figure 3a clearly shows a distinct frequency , which we will name the ramsey - type fringe frequency @xmath55 , for @xmath56{1-\\eta^2}=0.652714 $ ] and @xmath29 .",
    "the inset shows that the fringe frequency depends on the applied microwave frequency such that @xmath57 results in @xmath58 .",
    "similar behavior is observed for larger dissipation parameter @xmath59 shown in figure 3b .",
    "clearly , the fringe - frequency is different for @xmath32 , compared to figure 3a , and in this case @xmath60 results in @xmath58 .",
    "( 12,20.0)(0,0 ) ( -0 , -1 )    a number of simulations of the ramsey - type fringe frequency for different microwave frequencies have been conducted , and the results are summarized in figure 4 , where the fringe frequency @xmath55 is shown as a function of microwave frequency @xmath4 for the two different dissipation parameters mentioned in figure 3 .",
    "the vertical arrows indicate the linear resonance frequency @xmath34{1-\\eta^2}$ ] .",
    "the simulation data are represented by markers with error bars .",
    "the frequencies are read from figures like figure 3 . for low @xmath55 , less than one wavelength of fringe oscillation may be visible and the oscillation may be somewhat distorted ( see figure 3b ) . in such cases",
    "we measured the time from the first trough ( peak ) to the next peak ( trough ) and used the half period to determine the frequency . in the case of saturation such as figure 3a , we measured the period of the first regular waveform",
    ". these issues also account for some of the distortion in figure 4 .",
    "we observe the distinct `` v - shape '' signature of the ramsey - type frequency @xmath61 @xcite with a slope very close to @xmath62unity ( lines with slope @xmath63 are shown in figure 4 along with the simulation data ) , and @xmath58 for microwave frequencies close to @xmath64 .",
    "it is noticeable that the characteristic microwave frequency for which @xmath65 increases with @xmath54 , and we further notice that this characteristic frequency is smaller than @xmath64 . while we have found no experimental data for comparison , future experiments may want to address this observation .",
    "like rabi - type oscillations and resonant multi - peak switching distributions , ramsey - type fringes have been used to identify and analyze expected macroscopic quantum behavior of josephson systems . in this paper",
    "we have addressed the comparable classical system through direct simulations of the well - established nonlinear classical model equation , which is driven according to the recipe prescribed by the experimental reports of ramsey - fringes .",
    "our results show that even the simplest possible classical josephson model , the single rcsj model , clearly exhibits the features of ramsey - type fringes when the model is used to simulate a low temperature , low dissipation system .",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis of classical ramsey - type fringes @xcite can be developed in close analogy with , and extention of , the analysis of phase - locking transients that have been found to be responsible for , e.g. , rabi - type oscillations in pulsed microwave - driven classical josepshon systems @xcite .",
