    "the study of radial abundance gradients and of the enrichment ratio between helium and the heavy elements ( @xmath2 ) can be performed on the basis of photoionized nebulae , comprising hii regions and planetary nebulae ( pn , see for example the reviews by peimbert 1990 and maciel 1997 ) .",
    "the former have the advantage of representing the interstellar composition directly , while for the latter the influence of the contamination from the progenitor stars should be taken into account , particularly for those elements that are dredged up to the outer layers of the progenitor stars , such as helium and nitrogen .    in the case of helium ,",

    "the application of corrections to the observed abundances leads to a new determination of the he / h radial gradient @xmath3(he / h)/@xmath4 and of the slope @xmath2 .",
    "the o / h radial gradient is now well known , and can be derived for hii regions , planetary nebulae , hot stars , etc .",
    "it amounts roughly to @xmath5 dex / kpc , and similar values have been obtained for other elements , such as s and ar ( maciel 1997 , maciel & quireza 1999 ) .",
    "the existence of a he / h gradient is much more uncertain , and results obtained both from hii regions and planetary nebulae show a very large uncertainty , as seen in table 1 ( see esteban & peimbert 1995 for a review ) .",

    "the helium to metals enrichment ratio @xmath2 is generally determined adopting a linear variation for the helium abundance by mass with the metallicity @xmath22 of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the pregalactic helium abundance , as proposed by peimbert and torres - peimbert ( 1974 , 1976 ) .",

    "chiappini & maciel ( 1994 ) made a first attempt at including this contamination in a systematic way , and added a term @xmath34 to the @xmath35 relation , which can be written as    @xmath36    the stellar contribution @xmath34 was obtained on the basis of some calculations by boothroyd ( private communication ) .",
    "the adopted values were @xmath37 , 0.008 , 0.015 and 0.022 , which were applied to all nebulae in the sample , so that any differences in their _ individual _ behaviour were lost .",
    "the he excess by mass @xmath34 can be estimated from the yields of the intermediate mass stars as a function of the stellar mass on the main sequence @xmath38 and total metallicity @xmath22 , adopting @xmath39 , which is appropriate for type ii pn .",
    "the stellar mass on the main sequence can be obtained by an initial mass - final mass relation as a function of the pn core mass @xmath40 , which can in principle be determined from the observed nebular abundances , particularly the n / o ratio .    in this work ,",
    "we have adopted the recent yields by van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) , using as comparison the calculations by boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) .",
    "the former includes all three dredge up processes that occur in the late stages of the intermediate mass stars , and generally produce larger yields than the latter , as can be seen in figure  1 .",
    "we have assumed that most of the he excess that are dredged up to the surface is mixed up in the outer layers and ejected into the nebulae , so that our derived @xmath34 is the largest possible correction for a given mass .    in view of the uncertainties on the pn central star masses ,",
    "we have adopted two different calibrations , referred to as _ high mass _ and _ low mass _ calibrations , respectively .",

    "we have adopted @xmath74 kpc as in maciel & quireza ( 1999 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the correction procedure simply reduces the average he / h abundances , so that stars with different masses are probably scattered homogeneously in the whole range of galactocentric distances , thus destroying any systematic variations . in view of the uncertainties involved in the abundances ( and distances ) , it is unlikely that any he / h radial gradient could be presently detected from planetary nebulae , and previous determinations were probably affected by the use of small samples .    on the other hand ,",
    "an upper limit to the he / h gradient can be derived on the basis of the total dispersion @xmath75 observed .",
    "taking @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 , or @xmath78 dex / kpc .",
    "therefore , any existing he / h radial gradient should be lower than the o / h gradient by at least a factor of 3 .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the small gradients derived for galactic hii regions by esteban et al .",

    "steigman , this conference ) .",
    "we have taken into account all pn in our sample having metal abundances up to @xmath82 , which corresponds approximately to the solar value , @xmath83 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , or @xmath84 . as pointed out by chiappini & maciel ( 1994 ) , he abundances of pn",

    "( 1 ) would be needed . moreover ,",
    "some large metallicity pn have larger than average n / o ratios , so that the corrections to the he abundance are also larger and more uncertain .",
    "the main results are shown in table 4 and in figures  4 and 5 , where the pn are shown as filled circles .",
    "figure  4 shows the uncorrected abundances and fits , and figure  5 shows the results using the corrections according to the van den hoek and groenewegen data both for the high- and low - mass calibrations . in both figures , the straight lines are least squares fits using @xmath80 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath81 ( solid lines ) .",

    "these objects have _ not _ been taken into account in the determination of the linear fits , and are included for comparison only .",
    "it can be seen that the scatter in the pn data is somewhat higher , which is partially due to the higher uncertainties in the abundances and also to the adopted correction procedure , so that future improvements along these lines would be desirable .",
    "the higher uncertainties in the pn abundances and the lower he / h gradient are probably responsible for the lack of a he / h @xmath41 @xmath96 correlation , while some correlation between @xmath97 and @xmath22 ( or o / h ) can be observed .",
    "the application of the correction procedure reduces the average he abundances and the @xmath2 ratio , and also decreases the uncertainty of the derived slopes .",
    "the @xmath2 ratio decreases from the range 4.7  5.6 to values in the range 2.8  3.6 for @xmath80 and 2.0  2.8 for @xmath81 .",
    "these results are closer to recent independently derived ratios , as seen in table  2 ( see also thuan , this conference ) , and to the predictions of theoretical models ( allen et al . 1998 , chiappini et al . 1997 ) , particularly for the high mass calibration using the van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) data .",
    "the average uncertainties in the derived slopes are smaller as a consequence of the fact that a large number of objects has been included , with a larger metallicity spread .",
    "an average including both calibrations would give @xmath98 for @xmath80 and @xmath99 for @xmath81 , which can be compared with the uncertainties shown in table  2 .",
    "finally , the apparent continuity between the low metallicity and high metallicity objects of figure  5 suggests that their chemical evolution may not have been very different .",
    "in fact , the chemical evolution of a system is basically defined by its initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "the imf is now believed to be universal ( maciel & rocha - pinto 1998 , padoan et al . 1997 ) .",
    "blue compact galaxies have bursts of star formation , a feature that has been recently reinforced in our own galaxy , as shown by rocha - pinto et al .",

    "therefore , the similarity in the chemical evolution of the different systems shown in figure  5 is probably not surprising ."
