    "development of applications of homological tools has proceeded symbiotically with the development of good algorithms for computational homology @xcite . among the best of the latter",

    "are poised to cross the threshold from theory to computation to application . among the most promising",
    "is the theory of * sheaves*. developed for applications in algebraic topology and matured under a string of breathtaking advances in algebraic geometry , sheaf theory is perhaps best described as a formalization of local - to - global transitions in mathematics .",

    "a sheaf can be thought of as a _ data structure _ tethered to a space  a assignment to open sets @xmath3 of @xmath1 a homomorphism @xmath4 between @xmath2-modules  the algebraic `` data '' over the subsets  in a manner that respects composition and gluing ( see  [ sec : background ] ) . unlike in the case of a bundle ,",
    "the data sitting atop subsets of @xmath1 can change dramatically from place - to - place .",

    "topological space _ in and of itself , together with a projection map @xmath5 to the base space @xmath1 .",
    "this _ tale space _ topologizes the data structure and motivates examining its topological features , such as ( co)homology . 3 .",
    "a sheaf can be thought of as a _ coefficient system _ , assigning to locations in @xmath1 the spatially - varying @xmath2-module coefficients to be used for computing cohomology .",
    "this representation of the space within the algebraic category of @xmath2-modules provides enough structure to compute cohomology with location - dependent coefficients .",
    "it is these multiple interpretations that portend the ubiquity of sheaves within applied topology .",
    "though sheaves have long been recognized as useful data structures within certain branches of computer science ( e.g. , @xcite ) , sheaf cohomology has a number of emergent applications .",
    "these include :    1 .",
    "* signal processing : * sheaf cohomology recovers and extends the classical nyquist - shannon sampling theorem @xcite ; _ viz .",
    "_ , reconstruction from a sample is possible if and only if the appropriate cohomology of an associated ambiguity sheaf vanishes .",
    "* data aggregation : * data aggregation over a domain can be performed via euler integrals , an alternating reduction of the cohomology of an associated constructible sheaf over the domain @xcite .",
    "* network coding : * various problems in network coding ( maximum throughput , merging of networks , rerouting information flow around a failed subnetwork ) have interpretations as ranks of cohomologies of a sheaf over the network @xcite .",
    "* optimization : * the classical max - flow - min - cut theorem has a sheaf - theoretic analogue which phrases flow - values and cut - values as semimodule images of sheaf homology and cohomology respectively @xcite .",
    "* complexity : * a recent parallel to the blum - shub - smale theory of complexity @xcite has emerged for constructible sheaves @xcite .",
    "these early examples of applications vary greatly in terms of the types of coefficients used ( ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7-vector spaces to general commutative monoids ) and the types of base spaces . in most applications , however , the relevant sheaves are of a particular discrete form .",
    "topological spaces become computationally tractable substances through a discretization process : this most often takes the form of a simplicial or cell ( or cw ) complex . a similar modulation exists for sheaves ",
    "a sheaf is called _ constructible _ with respect to a given stratification of the base space if the data assigned to each stratum is locally constant .",
    "we will work in the category of * cellular sheaves * , which are constructible with respect to a fixed regular cw stratification of the base space @xcite .",
    "motivated by these applications , we establish algorithms for the computation of sheaf cohomology .",
    "our philosophy , inherited from other work on computational homology @xcite is that of reduction of the input structure to a smaller equivalent structure .",
    "we do so by means of * discrete morse theory * , retooling the machinery to work for sheaves .        a fair portion of the existing work on computational topology is naturally cast in the language of sheaves , providing novel paths for generalization . for example , euler integration  integration with respect to euler characteristic as a valuation  is sheaf - theoretic in nature and in origin , as per @xcite .",
    "it is in fact the decategorification of the cohomology of sheaves associated to constructible functions ( @xcite gives an exposition of this ) .",
    "more familiar to the reader will be persistent homology @xcite , which also has a sheaf - theoretic formulation as follows .",
    "the formal dual of a sheaf is a * cosheaf * ; in the cellular category , these are quite useful @xcite and possess a homology theory @xcite .",
    "the persistent homology of a filtration is the homology of a ( certain ) cosheaf over a cell complex homeomorphic to an interval @xcite .",
    "recent work on _ well groups _ associated to persistent homology has been expounded in terms of sheaves @xcite .",
    "discrete morse theory @xcite usually begins with the structure of a partial matching on the cells of a cw complex .",
    "the unmatched cells serve the same role as critical points do in smooth morse theory while the matched cells furnish gradient - like trajectories between them . a morse cochain complex",
    "may be constructed from this data : its cochain groups are freely generated by the critical cells and the boundary operators may be derived from gradient paths .",
    "the fundamental result is that the morse cochain complex so obtained is homologically equivalent to the original cw complex .",
    "this basic idea has since been vastly generalized and adapted to purely algebraic situations @xcite with only the slightest vestige of its topological origins .",
    "one can impose a partial matching directly on the basis elements of a cochain complex and apply discrete morse theory as usual .",
    "this approach has proved useful in the past when simplifying computation of homology groups of abstract cell complexes @xcite and the persistent homology groups of their filtrations @xcite .",
