    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are two examples of the astronomical objects collectively known as magnetars .",
    "these objects emit a large amount of energy in soft gamma rays and x - rays , and their energy source can not be explained in terms of the canonical rotation energy of neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "magnetic fields inside and outside magnetars are conjectured to be the main source of energy , with very strong magnetic fields required to explain their activity .",
    "magnetars are therefore a special class of nss that have strong magnetic fields . based on their periods ( @xmath3 ) and the time derivative of their periods ( @xmath4 ) , this class is thought to have magnetic fields larger than the critical strength @xmath5 g , beyond which the perturbative approach of quantum - electro dynamics breaks down .",
    "recently , two magnetars with surface dipole magnetic fields smaller than @xmath6 were reported @xcite .",
    "these objects gave us important clues as to the nature of the magnetic field inside magnetars .",
    "since @xmath3 and @xmath4 measurements can only provide information on the dipole ( poloidal ) component of the field , there is no constraint on the toroidal component . as such , the unknown toroidal fields",
    "are often thought to provide the large energy required to account for magnetar activity .",
    "the two low - magnetic field sgrs are thought to be explained by hidden internal magnetic fields ( e.g. , sgr 0418 + 5729 , @xcite ) .",
    "it is often discussed in the literature that parity violation in weak interactions can lead to asymmetric neutrino emission in strongly magnetized nss . given that neutrinos transfer momentum",
    ", asymmetric neutrino emission originating from poloidal fields can therefore impart linear momentum to a ns , which is a possible cause of pulsar kicks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , asymmetric neutrino emission could also transfer angular momentum from new - born nss @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the opacity of nss to the neutrinos that carry away the thermal energy .",
    "we specifically focus on the toroidal component and the spin evolution of magnetars .",
    "section [ sec : scenario ] opens with the basic picture of this paper .",
    "section [ sec : transfer ] is devoted to the derivation of the neutrino transfer equation and its solution .",
    "in addition , we give simple relations between the total angular momentum of a ns and the angular momentum emitted by neutrinos . in section [ sec :",
    "constraint ] we give the constraint on the magnetar s internal field .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the basic picture studied in this paper .",
    "as is well known , nss are formed by the gravitational collapse of massive stars , leading to core - collapse supernova explosions . at first , just after their formation , nss are hot ( the temperature is typically @xmath7 k ) , and in this phase they are referred to as protoneutron stars ( pnss ) .",
    "the stars then proceed to cool down due to neutrino emission ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical timescale of the cooling , referred to as the kelvin - helmholtz cooling time and denoted @xmath8 in the following , is @xmath9 s. , where @xmath10 is the thermal energy stored in the pns and @xmath11 is the neutrino luminosity . ] in this paper , we are focusing on this early pns cooling phase .",
    "note that this is different from conventional ns cooling , the timescale of which is typically of @xmath12 years .    during the pns cooling phase",
    ", the strong magnetic field induces anisotropic interactions between neutrinos and polarized nucleons and electrons .",
    "these interactions lead to an anisotropic deformation of the neutrino flux , which in turn imparts a linear momentum to the pns and produces a pulsar kick ( section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the emitted neutrinos may also transfer angular momentum , causing the pns to spin - up / down .",
    "these linear and angular momentum transfers are caused by the strong poloidal and toroidal components of magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of the angular momentum allows us to determine the dependency of the ns spin on the toroidal field strength .",
    "the optical depth of neutrinos during this period is much higher than unity , so the neutrino transfer is approximated with the diffusion equation as derived and solved in section [ sec : transfer ] . using this solution",
    ", we give an estimate for the angular momentum transferred as a result of the anisotropic neutrino emission in the strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "anisotropic neutrino emission makes the pns slower or faster depending on the directions of the rotation and magnetic fields during the pns cooling phase . after this initial phase ,",
    "the magnetar spins - down due to the canonical dipole radiation in the typical time scale of the current pulsar age , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "let us here consider the constraint on the toroidal magnetic field by utilizing available present observations of magnetar spin periods",
    ". observed rotational periods of magnetars are slow and localized to a narrow range , from @xmath152 to @xmath1511 s ( see table [ tab ] ) .",
    "this means that the total angular momentum transferred by the neutrinos in the pns phase is smaller than the initial ns angular momentum at that time .",
    "if this were not the case , a fine tuning would be needed to produce the slow spin concentration , because the direction of neutrino angular momentum transfer does not depend on the spin direction ( see figure [ fig : t - omega ] ) .",
    "for example , if the magnitude of the neutrino momentum transfer is larger than the initial angular momentum , even ns spin - up is possible via momentum transfer in the opposite direction ( see case ( d ) in figure [ fig : t - omega ] ) .",
    "as such , the assumption that the transferred angular momentum is smaller than that of the ns at @xmath16 seems reasonable . using the associated supernova remnant ( snr ) age as the current age of magnetars ( @xmath17 ) , we can evaluate the spin period at @xmath16 by turning back the spin using the dipole radiation model ( see appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the amount of angular momentum that can be transferred by the neutrinos can be constrained using the angular momentum at @xmath16 .",
    "by using this constraint we will then put an upper limit on the internal toroidal magnetic field ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : bphi ] and [ eq : bphi2 ] ) .    .",
    "for @xmath18 the neutrino emission changes the ns spin and for @xmath19 the ns rotation is decelerated by the usual dipole radiation . depending on the direction of magnetic fields , the ns spin evolution can be classified as following . in the case ( a ) , since the toroidal filed is absent , for @xmath18 the rotation velocity is not altered by neutrino emission ; in the case ( b ) , the neutrinos decelerate the ns spin ; in the case ( c ) , the neutrinos accelerate the ns spin ; in the case ( d ) , the neutrinos first decelerate the ns spin and eventually the ns rotation is stopped .",
    "since the neutrinos transfer the angular momentum even after the ns rotation stops , then the ns starts counterrotating ( dotted line ) . the spin deceleration by dipole radiation does not depend on the rotation direction , so that the spin evolution for @xmath20 is similar independent on the evolution for @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear that the rotation period of nss distribute broadly if the neutrinos significantly affect the spin evolution .",
    "therefore , if the neutrino effect dominates the spin evolution of nss for @xmath18 , in order to concentrate the current spin period of nss in a narrow range , neutrino effect upon the ns spin should be small enough .",

    "thus , the toroidal magnetic fields of these magnetars can be comparable to the dipole component at least at the moment of birth .",
    "note that this constraint only applies to the global toroidal field , i.e. the angle averaged value near the ns surface , since the angular momenta transferred by turbulent components on small scales cancel each other out .",

    "first , we employed the diffusion approximation for the neutrino radiative transfer equation .",
    "this assumption is essentially valid for the region of the magnetar considered in this work , but near the surface , where the mean free path of neutrinos is comparable to the scale size , this approximation starts to break down .",
    "however , since we are considering the region inside the pns , the effect of the break - down of this assumption is not significant .",
    "secondly , for simplicity we have assumed that the pns radius is constant during the cooling phase .",
    "however , this assumption does not change our discussion drastically because the constraints on the internal toroidal magnetic field given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bphi ] ) and ( [ eq : bphi2 ] ) imply very weak dependence on the pns radius .",
    "in addition , since a smaller pns radius gives a tighter upper limit for the toroidal field , our assumption of constant radius will tend to give more conservative upper limits .",
    "thirdly , since the real age of a magnetar is unknown , we assumed it to be the same as that of the snr .",
    "because the snr age contains systemic errors , this approximation might affect the derived constraint .",
    "however , we expect that the corrections to the age do not change it by orders of magnitude , meaning that our discussion in the previous section should not change very much even if we include this systematic error .",
    "finally , we have assumed that after neutrino emission the sole mechanism behind the magnetar spin - down is dipole radiation .",
    "there are several other mechanisms that can decelerate a ns s spin ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will tend to lead to looser constraints on the internal fields .",
    "this is because these mechanisms usually act later than the neutrinos so that a smaller @xmath158 is possible .",
    "more detailed studies that include the effects of other deceleration mechanisms are necessary .",
