    "[ fig : phasediag ] ) .",
    "2 .   the excitation density at lowest temperatures @xmath38 ( blue arch in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] ) is dominated by spin fluctuations for @xmath53 which lead to an additional enhancement compared to @xmath35 . however , due to magnetic order for @xmath68 the low-@xmath9 dos is strongly reduced by the onset of fermi surface gapping associated with the magnetic instabilities .      the two distinct magnetic regions in the phase diagram , with spin fluctuations and with magnetic order , are separated by a transition region . the smooth transition between @xmath100 may well reflect the coexistence of more than one phase , as was first invoked by sakurai et al .",
    "based on magnetization and heat capacity studies @xcite . in the following",
    "it will be discussed in the light of extensive structural studies by huang et al.@xcite .",
    "structural transitions - particularly associated with the complex interplay between the temperature - dependent na mobility and the inherent propensity in  to na ordering - were intensely studied .",
    "there is evidence @xcite that only some well - defined compositions result in stable crystallographic phases that differ in the na positioning in the unit cell and the occupation of the inequivalent na sites . in between those particular @xmath0 values , phase separation into distinct phases with different",
    "na content occurs @xcite .",
    "this effect has been invoked in the high-@xmath0 range also to explain the presence of paramagnetic volume in otherwise magnetically ordered samples @xcite . recently",
    "a particular na rearrangement process was shown to lead to distinct magnetically ordered states associated with different phases in the same crystal and the connection to na diffusion as its origin was established @xcite . in this context",
    "the distinct but gradual change observed in @xmath35 and @xmath38 for @xmath100 which marks the transition between the two adjacent magnetic ranges could well be the result of the coexistence of one high-@xmath0 phase hosting magnetic order and another phase with lower @xmath0 associated with the spin fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , in the studies by huang et al .",
    "@xcite a coexistance between the so called h1 and h2 phases is observed in this narrow @xmath0 range . thus it would be reasonable to associate the spin fluctuation phase with h1 and the sdw phase with h2 .",
    "it would be worthwile , however , to clarify in detail to what degree structural parameters , other than the ones distinguishing h1 , h2 and h3 , need to be included in order to capture the subtle differences of the various phases .      as shown in the phase diagram above , in addition to the spin fluctuation contribution to @xmath6 that vanishes in high magnetic fields",
    ", there is another enhancement for @xmath7 that is not suppressed by magnetic fields and is also detectible at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath40 ) . in the following paragraph",
    "we concentrate our discussion on @xmath35 as it is not affected by spin fluctuations or magnetic order .",
    "we note that @xmath35 is enhanced by a factor of 2 .. 3 compared to the expected values from band structure calculations ( around @xmath102)@xcite and the arpes experimental data ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "in addition to our findings , two other extensive studies @xcite support our results .",
    "obviously the electronic dos is significantly higher for @xmath7 which is tentatively ascribed to an additional band crossing the fermi surface following yoshizumi et al .",
    "@xcite . this could most likely be the @xmath104 character band which has been calculated to develop a dip near the @xmath105 point for higher @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this would result in the emergence of an electron pocket when @xmath8 touches the band from below upon filling of the co - o states with increasing x. consistent with our findings , the onset of small-@xmath106 magnetic fluctuations is predicted to accompany the changes of the fermi surface topology @xcite .",
    "a second explanation would involve the @xmath107 character hole pockets that were intensely sought for in numerous arpes studies . in a rigid band picture",
    "these should rather disappear with increasing fermi level which has also been predicted by numerous theoretical studies @xcite and recently been claimed to be observed experimentally @xcite . even if the hole pockets were stabilized also for higher @xmath0 as predicted by some models @xcite , the dos behaviour observed here could hardly be explained .",
    "further , another possibility would be ascribing the observed enhancement for higher @xmath0 purely to the onset of strong electron - electron correlations in which case a significant impact on the band structure was anticipated by theoretical studies @xcite leading to a band picture being more consistent with the arpes results .",
    "however , no origin for such a dramatic increase of correlations around @xmath108 could be identified so far rendering this option rather speculative .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath6 calculated from arpes - measured band dispersions involving one major fermi surface agrees well with the lda - calculated @xmath6 across the whole phase diagram although there are severe discrepancies between the arpes findings and the calculated dispersions : the bandwidth observed in the arpes studies is systematically reduced compared to bandstructure calculations , being @xmath109 instead of @xmath110 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion of the hopping integral @xmath111 being renormalized by a factor @xmath112 already at higher temperatures which should be reflected in a dramatically enhanced dos compared to the calculations .",
    "however , the absence of the @xmath107 character hole pockets or other additional fermi surface segments seem to exactly compensate this effect in the arpes measurements .",
    "thus it appears that the arpes results so far do not account for the highly enhanced dos values for @xmath7 . even though it is commonly noted that there must be strong correlations present to explain the small bandwidth , in combination with the experimentally observed fermi surface topology this does not suffice to explain the high @xmath6 values .",
    "interestingly , there is a discrepancy concerning the dimensionality of the electronic system in the high @xmath0 range among the arpes studies .",
    "one study sees a significant @xmath29-dispersion resulting in additional fs segments @xcite while in most cases the system seems to remain quasi-2d @xcite .",
    "if additional fermi surface caused by three - dimensionality was present , a higher dos is consequently to be expected .    to decide which of these scenarios - or possibly others",
    "- realistically describe the electronic states in  is an intriguing puzzle and awaits clarification by further studies . in the light of the recently observed coupling between the fermi surface instabilities and the degree of freedom imposed by sodium mobility and the plethora of possible ordering patterns @xcite ,",
    "it is obvious that future theoretical studies should reach beyond the virtual crystal approximation and realistically model the interplay between na driven coulomb potential patterns , fermi surface topology & dimensionality and charge / magnetic order .",
    "the interpretation of our heat capacity and muon - spin rotation data provides a consistent picture of the  low energy electronic excitation density for both intermediate and low temperatures over a large sodium concentration range and for both single and polycrystals .",
    "the comparison with previous data as compiled in fig .  [ fig : phasediag ] provides a comprehensive summary of the current and previously published data and reflects the agreement among the results from various studies .",
    "some of the conclusions arrived at in the present study have been suggested before , such as the coexistence of a spin fluctuation and a magnetically ordered phase for @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "new insight , however , is gained from our in - depth analysis of both @xmath35 and @xmath38 : our field - dependent heat capacity measurements in quantitative comparison with arpes and lda results reveal a rich and complex picture which renders spin fluctuations to be only one out of two coexisting low energy excitation density enhancement mechanisms for @xmath7 .    for the whole @xmath0 range the _ high energy _ band dispersion as measured by arpes yields a density of states consistent with lda band structure calculations ( dos around @xmath114 ) .",
    "however , the _ low energy _ excitation spectrum ( @xmath115 ) as measured by specific heat reveals distinctly richer phenomena : for @xmath7 the intermediate-@xmath9 dos is 2 ... 3 times higher ( @xmath116 ) . in the range @xmath66 the low - temperature excitation density",
    "is dominated by spin fluctuations that can be suppressed in a magnetic field and cause even stronger renormalization of @xmath6 as compared to the intermediate - temperature range , but no magnetic long - range order is present . a variety of magnetically ordered states",
    "is then observed for @xmath68 , including a @xmath34 ferromagnetic - type transition in addition to the previously studied sdw - like @xmath33 transition .    in the light of the low dos derived from arpes and lda calculations and the existence of a second dos enhancement mechanism seen in the excitation density phase diagram ( be it a band structure or renormalization effect ) ,",
    "the question whether fermi surface gapping caused by magnetic ordering is present in the high-@xmath0 range is not trivially answered by a loss of low-@xmath9 dos as compared to intermediate-@xmath9 dos . here",
    ", our nuclear heat capacity analysis provides important additional evidence based upon which it can be concluded that the magnetic order involving the itinerant electrons indeed causes the disappearance of part of the fermi surface .",
    "thus , the @xmath117 range of the phase diagram is highlighted to be most interesting by the presence of a high dos and fermi surface loss through magnetic instabilities .",
    "the revisited phase diagram illustrates the rich physics of the correlated electrons moving on the triangular lattice in the presence of a controllable potential landscape defined by ordering patterns formed by highly mobile na ions ."
