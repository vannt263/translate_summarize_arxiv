    "in this paper we will show examples of @xmath0 matrix - valued orthogonal functions @xmath1 which are simultaneously eigenfunctions of a second - order differential operator of schrdinger type , i.e. @xmath2 where the matrix - valued potential @xmath3 ( independent of @xmath4 ) is a diagonal quadratic matrix polynomial ( but not a scalar multiple of the identity ) , and an integral operator of fourier type , i.e. @xmath5 where the matrix - valued kernel @xmath6 is also diagonal ( but not a scalar multiple of the identity ) of the form @xmath7 for some diagonal matrix @xmath8 .",
    "we will also show that it is possible to construct suitable families @xmath1 such that the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath9 and @xmath10 are diagonal .",
    "hence both differential and integral operators commute in the space of all matrix - valued functions spanned by @xmath1 .",
    "observe that the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 appear on the _ right_. this denotes that the potential coefficient and the kernel are multiplied on the _ right _ , respectively , while the eigenvalues appear on the _",
    "left_. with this configuration it is straightforward to derive that both differential and integral operators commute in the space of all matrix - valued functions spanned by @xmath1 , i.e. for any @xmath13 , @xmath14 since the eigenvalues are diagonal matrices . in particular we will see in section [ con ] that this commutativity property holds in @xmath15 ( see section [ pre ] for definitions ) for the examples we consider in this paper .    in the scalar situation the examples of simultaneously eigenfunctions of an integral and a differential operator",
    "are very special and usually are related to many areas of engineering , physics , chemistry and mathematics .",
    "prominent examples are the hermite or wave functions which satisfy the schrdinger equation with @xmath16 and also are eigenfunctions of the fourier transform ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the hermite functions play an important role in quantum mechanics to model the one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator ( see @xcite ) , or in chemistry in vibration of molecules ( see @xcite ) , among other applications .",
    "also the prolate spheroidal wave functions in signal processing satisfy certain second - order differential equation and are eigenfunctions of the so - called _",
    "sinc kernel_. this remarkable fact was discovered in a series of papers by the bell labs group in the early 1960s , see @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the commuting property and other similar properties are very closely related to the classical orthogonal polynomials of hermite , laguerre , jacobi and bessel .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the author produces naturally appearing global operators that happen to commute with properly chosen local operators .    in the last few years",
    "many examples of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials @xmath17 have appeared satisfying second - order differential equations of sturm - liouville type , i.e. @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are matrix polynomials ( which do not depend on @xmath4 ) of degrees less than or equal to 2 , 1 and 0 , respectively , and @xmath9 are hermitian matrices ( if the family @xmath17 is orthonormal ) .",
    "these examples are the matrix analogue of the classical families of hermite , laguerre and jacobi polynomials .",
    "since the classical families are intimately related with integral equations , it is natural to expect that these new families of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials are related to matrix - valued integral equations .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show some examples of simultaneously eigenfunctions of an integral and a differential operator in the matrix case .    for that purpose we will consider families of matrix - valued orthogonal functions ( constructed from the matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials and a weight matrix ) such that they are orthogonal in the corresponding function spaces ( more on this in section [ pre ] ) .",
    "this treatment will allow us to obtain , for the examples we study in this paper , matrix - valued schrdinger operators of the form and integral equations of the form .",
    "schrdinger operators with hermitian matrix - valued potentials ( usually with some restrictions on the potential ) are not new in the literature .",
    "they have been considered in @xcite to study many analytical properties of these operators .",
    "also matrix - valued functions are considered for some problems in wavelet theory to model matrix - valued signals , e.g. video images ( see @xcite ) .",
    "to give an idea of the results contained in this paper let us display here one of the examples we study in section [ first ] .",
    "consider a family of matrix - valued functions @xmath1 defined in .",
    "then they satisfy the following matrix - valued schrdinger equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the diagonal matrix defined in .",
    "this differential equation ( for the monic family ) was already derived in section 6.2 of @xcite ( with non diagonal eigenvalue ) .",
    "the family we consider in will transform the eigenvalue into another convenient diagonal one .",
    "then the family of matrix - valued orthogonal functions @xmath1 satisfies the following integral equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diagonal matrix .",
    "therefore the kernel and the eigenvalue in are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "observe that they are diagonal , but not necessarily scalars multiple of the identity .",
    "this result will have important consequences .",
    "in particular we will derive some structural formulas and integral equations of the corresponding matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ pre ] we give some preliminaries . in section [ mvof ]",
    "we derive the matrix - valued differential equation satisfied by the matrix - valued functions constructed from the matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials and a weight matrix .",
    "we will focus on the case when the leading coefficient @xmath27 is of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a scalar polynomial of degree less than or equal to 2 ( the case considered in @xcite ) .",
    "this result holds for any family supported in any interval @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 .    in sections [ first ] and [ second ] we study in full detail two examples supported in @xmath32 , which previously appeared in @xcite and derive differential and integral equations for the corresponding families of matrix - valued orthogonal functions . as a consequence we will derive _ real _ ( and complex ) integral equations for the families of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials , among other structural formulas of general size @xmath0 .",
    "we also study , for both examples , the special case of @xmath33 . in this case",
    "we can write our ( normalized ) matrix - valued orthogonal functions @xmath34 in terms of classical hermite or wave functions . we will plot some of the entries of @xmath35 for the first values of @xmath4 , as well as derive some integrals involving these functions .",
    "finally , section [ con ] addresses the issue of the completeness of these functions , gives a summary of the results of the paper and the challenges that lie ahead .",

    "then we can module fourier expansions of orthonormal systems in @xmath46,\\mathbb{c}^{n\\times n})}$ ] ( see pp .",
    "78 in @xcite ) .    in a similar way",
    ", we can define the weighted spaces @xmath50,\\mathbb{c}^{n\\times n})}$ ] of all matrix - valued functions in one variable with the inner product @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a weight matrix with a smooth density @xmath53 with respect to the lebesgue measure , satisfying ( 1 ) @xmath54 is positive semidefinite for any borel set @xmath55 , ( 2 ) @xmath53 has finite moments of every order and ( 3 ) @xmath56 is nonsingular if the leading coefficient of a matrix polynomial @xmath57 is nonsingular .",
    "condition ( 3 ) above is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the existence of a sequence of matrix polynomials orthogonal with respect to of degree @xmath4 with nonsingular leading coefficient , and it is fulfilled , in particular , when @xmath53 is positive definite at an interval of the real line .",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that there exist a real number @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "now we introduce two matrices that are going to play a very important role in the rest of the paper .",
    "the first one is the @xmath0 nilpotent matrix ( i.e. @xmath60=0 ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a matrix with 1 at entry @xmath63 and 0 elsewhere , while the second is the diagonal matrix @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath22 satisfy the algebraic relation @xmath66=-a,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 , denote the usual adjoint operators defined by @xmath68 , @xmath69 as a consequence @xmath70 as it is easy to see by induction .",
    "we will now introduce real or complex valued functions with matrix argument .",
    "the taylor series of an infinitely differentiable @xmath71 in a neighborhood of @xmath72 is @xmath73 whenever we write @xmath74 , for any @xmath0 matrix @xmath75 , we will mean the following matrix @xmath76 it is clear that @xmath77 for any two real or complex valued functions @xmath78 .    in particular we will be interested in the evaluation of @xmath79 or @xmath80 , where @xmath65 and @xmath22 are defined in and respectively , for certain real or complex valued functions @xmath71 .",
    "observe first that , since @xmath65 is nilpotent , then @xmath81 i.e. @xmath79 is a finite sum of linear combinations of the powers of @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that all real or complex valued algebraic or differential manipulations for functions @xmath82 can be applied to the matrix @xmath79 .",
    "for instance , when we write @xmath83 , it will denote the matrix @xmath84    on the contrary , the diagonal matrix @xmath80 will not be a finite sum of linear combinations of the powers of @xmath22 .",
    "that is the case of the following diagonal matrices . for @xmath85 , the matrix @xmath80",
    "is defined by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the imaginary unit .",
    "these matrices will play a very important role in the integral equations that we will study in sections [ first ] and [ second ] . observe that for @xmath88 in we have the identity matrix @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 we have the complex diagonal matrix @xmath91 and for @xmath92 we have @xmath93 which is real and satisfies @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath95 we have the inverse of , while for @xmath96 all matrices will reduce to one of the matrices mentioned above .",
    "these diagonal matrices are going to play the same role that the imaginary unit @xmath87 plays in the scalar situation .",
    "observe that in we are taking the principal value of @xmath97 .",
    "however it is clear that if we take any other value we will have that @xmath98 for any @xmath99 , so it will not give any additional information .",
    "similarly we can define the following diagonal ( and singular ) matrices @xmath100 @xmath101 in the special case of @xmath90 the explicit expression of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the diagonal real matrices @xmath104 and @xmath105    this is the only significant case , since for @xmath92 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 and for @xmath95 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we remark the following relations @xmath110 we will use these matrices to derive real integral equations of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials in section [ first ] .",
    "now we will prove the following lemma , which gives commutativity relations between the powers of @xmath65 and @xmath111 :    [ lema1 ] the matrices @xmath65 and @xmath111 , defined in and respectively , satisfy the following algebraic relation @xmath112    proof :    it is enough to prove this for @xmath113 . for the rest of values of @xmath114",

    "as we mentioned in the introduction , in the last few years many families of @xmath0 matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials @xmath17 have been found along with their orthogonality measure @xmath53 satisfying second - order differential equations of the form @xmath119 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are matrix polynomials ( which do not depend on @xmath4 ) of degrees less than or equal to 2 , 1 and 0 , respectively , and @xmath9 are hermitian matrices ( if the family @xmath17 is orthonormal ) .",
    "these families are natural orthogonal systems in the weighted spaces @xmath50,\\mathbb{c}^{n\\times n})}$ ] .",
    "typically the weight matrices with this property can be factorized in the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a scalar function ( hermite , laguerre or jacobi weight ) and @xmath122 is a matrix - valued function which satisfies a first order differential equation with initial conditions of the form @xmath123 for some @xmath58 .",
    "the differential coefficient @xmath124 in is connected with the coefficients @xmath19 of the differential operator and @xmath121 ( see the proof below of theorem [ phiteo ] for more details or @xcite ) .",
    "many examples have been found in the last years by solving a set of three symmetry differential equations that are equivalent to the second - order differential operator being self - adjoint with respect to the inner product ( see @xcite ) . for a different approach , using matrix - valued spherical functions , see @xcite .",

    "these differential equations in the scalar case are very important with diverse applications to physics , engineering and mathematical analysis itself ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we will concentrate on examples 5.1 and 5.2 of @xcite .",
    "we will always denote by @xmath1 the matrix - valued functions for all the examples , while there is no confusion about which family we are using from the context . in the case",
    "we are referring to different examples at the same time we will denote them by @xmath147 , @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the example in section [ first ] and @xmath150 is the example in section [ second ] .",

    "since @xmath176 satisfies and @xmath1 is a system of linearly independent matrix - valued functions this is equivalent to say that @xmath182 for all @xmath183 .",

    "there are four possible combinations of multiplying these matrices on the right and on the left .",

    "@xmath118    observe that and give _",
    "eight _ real integral equations of the family @xmath17 according to positive or negative sign and odd or even values of @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for eight formulas is the structure of the matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 , defined in and respectively .",
    "these are diagonal singular matrices and whenever we multiply them on the right or on the left we only get a description of some of the entries of @xmath223 ( which is a full matrix in general ) .",
    "it is exactly this combination of multiplying on the right and on the left by these matrices that allows us to have a formula for every entry of @xmath223 . in other words ,",
    "if we multiply on the left by @xmath103 and on the right by both @xmath103 or @xmath102 , we get a description of the @xmath224 rows of @xmath223 while if we multiply on the left by @xmath102 and on the right by both @xmath103 or @xmath102 , we get a description of the @xmath225 rows of @xmath223 , respectively .",

    "we have found that the family of polynomials @xmath17 defined in ( and the family we will study in section [ second ] defined in ) simplifies considerably many structural formulas .",
    "for instance , the norms of @xmath17 ( and consequently the norms of @xmath1 with respect to the inner product ) are diagonal .",
    "also the coefficients of the three - term recurrence relation are considerably simplified .",
    "a detailed study of these and other structural formulas for @xmath17 will be discussed in future publications .      in this section we will study in detail the properly normalized matrix - valued functions @xmath1 for the special case of @xmath33 .",
    "we will show their relationship with the scalar hermite or wave functions , derive some structural formulas and plot graphs of the diagonal entries of @xmath226 for some values of @xmath4 and @xmath227 ( the only free parameter in the matrix @xmath65 , see ) .",
    "using theorem 5.1 of @xcite one can derive an explicit expression for the family of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials @xmath17 defined in .",

    "hence @xmath236 in the expressions above we are using standard properties of hermite polynomials and wave functions like @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",

    "the effect of the parameter @xmath227 can be studied from the explicit expression of and .",
    "for instance , as @xmath227 tends to 0 we observe that the diagonal entries of converge to two copies of the hermite functions while the off diagonal entries tend to 0 . if @xmath227 is large , the diagonal entries get small compared with the off diagonal entries ( for the first values of @xmath4 ) .    in figure 1 and 2",
    "we have plotted the diagonal entries of @xmath240 , which are probability densities in @xmath241 , for every @xmath242 , and for the special choice of @xmath243 .",
    "the numbers on the graphics correspond to the value of @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that in the scalar situation there exist @xmath4 points ( the zeros of the hermite polynomials ) where the probability density @xmath244 is exactly 0 . in our case",
    "our two probability densities never vanish .",

    "[ coro112 ] the family of matrix - valued orthogonal functions @xmath1 and the family of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials @xmath17 satisfy the following symmetric conditions @xmath277    observe now that the symmetry conditions are exactly the same as the classical hermite polynomials .",

    "@xmath280    observe now , because of , that there are only two real integral equations , unlike the example studied in section [ first ] .",
    "using theorem 5.1 of @xcite one can derive an explicit expression for the family of matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials @xmath17 defined in .",
    "they can be written as @xmath281 where @xmath229 , @xmath179 are the classical hermite polynomials , and @xmath239 is a sequence of real positive numbers defined by @xmath282 we can normalize this family since the norms of @xmath17 are diagonal @xmath283 therefore the normalized matrix - valued functions @xmath233 can be written in the following form @xmath284 where @xmath235 are the normalized hermite functions .",
    "therefore @xmath285 observe from the definition of @xmath239 in that the diagonal entries of are probability densities depending on one free parameter @xmath227 .",
    "the effect of the parameter @xmath227 is similar to the example studied in section [ first ] .    in figure 3 and 4",

    "in this paper we have shown the first examples of integral operators having families of matrix - valued orthogonal functions as eigenfunctions , which at the same time are eigenfunctions of a second - order differential operator of schrdinger type .",
    "we have focused on two examples supported in the real line appeared in @xcite .",
    "certainly other examples supported in the real line have been found as well .",
    "for instance , the example in theorem 1.1 in @xcite and the example included in the appendix a.1 in @xcite .",
    "these examples are generalizations of the example studied in section [ first ] .",
    "we have found that these examples also satisfy similar integral equations of the form , along with similar structural formulas and integral equations for the matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials .",
    "these integral operators are slight modifications of the usual fourier transform , but not necessarily the scalar fourier transform .",
    "instead , we can perform fourier analysis for matrix - valued functions using the families of matrix - valued orthogonal functions introduced in sections [ first ] and [ second ] .",
    "this is different from the usual fourier analysis where the kernel is @xmath292 , and the transform is applied entry by entry .",
    "for instance , for the examples @xmath293 , @xmath294 , introduced in sections [ first ] and [ second ] respectively we can recover any matrix - valued function @xmath295 that can be written in the form @xmath296 with the inner product @xmath297 defined in .",
    "this representation is in fact always possible for any @xmath295 , since our families of eigenfunctions @xmath147 , @xmath294 , are _ complete _ in @xmath15 .",
    "we omit the details , but this is a consequence of having our weight matrices and as nonsingular matrices that die out exponentially at infinity to the zero matrix , that is @xmath298    hence it is possible to extend to the matrix case all the results necessary to proof the completeness of hermite ( and laguerre ) polynomials ( see , for instance , the theorem appeared in @xcite or section 6.5 of @xcite ) and use fourier expansions ( see pp .",
    "78 in @xcite ) to conclude that our families @xmath147 , @xmath294 , are complete in @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , define the following two integral transforms of @xmath36 @xmath299 where @xmath111 is defined in and @xmath300 acting on the right means that the kernel is multiplied on the right .",
    "the case @xmath88 is the usual fourier transform entry by entry but if we multiply on the right by @xmath111 we can recover @xmath36 in a nicer way using the eigenfunctions @xmath147 , @xmath294 . if we define the inverse of the previous two integral transforms as @xmath301 it is easy to see that @xmath302 and @xmath303 using the symmetry condition @xmath304 ( see and ) .",
    "therefore @xmath305    that means that fourier analysis of matrix - valued functions in @xmath15 can be studied , at least , in two different ways according to the fourier type transform that we consider and its corresponding eigenfunctions , not only applying fourier transform entry by entry ."
