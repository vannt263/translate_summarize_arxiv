    "the classical discrete fourier analysis works with the periodic exponential functions @xmath6 for @xmath7 in the set @xmath8 .",
    "the central piece is the discrete fourier transform defined via an inner product over the set of equally spaced points @xmath9 in @xmath10 , which agrees with the continuous fourier transform for trigonometric polynomials of degree at most @xmath11 .",
    "this is equivalent to gaussian quadrature formula for trigonometric polynomials , and it can be used to define trigonometric interpolation based on the equally spaced points .",
    "all three quantities , discrete fourier transform , quadrature , and interpolation , are important tools in numerous applications and form an integrated part of the discrete fourier analysis .    in several variables , periodicity of functions can be defined via a lattice @xmath12 , which is a discrete group described by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a nonsingular matrix .",
    "a function @xmath15 is periodic with respect to @xmath16 if @xmath17 for any @xmath18 . the usual multiple fourier analysis of @xmath19 uses periodicity defined by the lattice @xmath20 .",
    "one can develop a discrete fourier analysis in several variables with a lattice periodicity , which has been defined in connection with signal processing and sampling theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the domain on which the analysis takes place is the fundamental domain of the lattice , which is a bounded set @xmath21 that tiles @xmath19 in the sense that @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that the family of exponentials @xmath23 , in which @xmath24 is the dual lattice , forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath25 and these exponentials are periodic with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "these two facts make it possible to establish a complete analogue of the classical fourier analysis .",
    "recent in @xcite , a discrete fourier transform is defined and used to study cubature and trigonometric interpolation on the domain @xmath21 , which provides a general framework for the discrete fourier analysis with lattice tiling .",
    "detail studies are carried out in @xcite for the hexagon lattice , for which the fundamental domain is a regular hexagon , when @xmath26 , and in @xcite for the face - centered cubic lattice , for which the fundamental domain is a rhombic dodecahedron , when @xmath27 .",
    "the regular hexagon and the rhombic dodecahedron are invariant under the reflection group @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . in the present paper",
    "we shall consider the lattice of type @xmath2 for all @xmath30 , for which the fundamental domain is the union of the images of a regular simplex in @xmath19 under the group action .",
    "our goal is then to establish a discrete fourier analysis on the fundamental domain of the @xmath2 lattice in @xmath19 that is comparable with the classical theory in one variable as outlined in the first paragraph of this introduction .",
    "however , this is only the first step .",
    "the frame work developed in @xcite applies to the fundamental domain @xmath21 that tiles @xmath19 without overlapping , which means that @xmath21 contains only part of its own boundary .",
    "for example , if the lattice is @xmath20 , then the domain is the half open and half closed @xmath31 .",
    "the points on which the discrete fourier transform is defined consist of lattice points in @xmath32 , which is not symmetric under the reflection group @xmath33 , as part of the boundary points are not included .",
    "thus , as a second step , we will develop a discrete fourier analysis that uses a symmetric set of points by working with the congruence of the boundary points under translation by the lattice and under the action of the group @xmath33 , which requires delicate analysis .",
    "furthermore , by restricting to functions that are invariant under the group , the results on the set of symmetric points in the step 2 can be transformed to results on a simplex that makes up the fundamental domain .",
    "this is our third step , which establishes a fourier analysis on trigonometric functions on a regular simplex in @xmath19 . for the classical fourier analysis ,",
    "this step amounts to a discrete analysis on cosine and sine functions .",
    "we will define analogues of cosine and sine functions on a simplex in the step 3 .",
    "the classical chebyshev polynomials arise from cosine and sine functions . as our fourth step",
    ", we define generalized chebyshev polynomials of the first and the second kind from those generalized cosine and sine functions , respectively , and study the discrete analysis of these algebraic polynomials .    in each of the steps outlined above",
    ", we will develop a concrete discrete fourier analysis associated with the @xmath2 lattice in @xmath19 , providing explicit formulas and detailed analysis .",
    "the cases @xmath26 and @xmath34 studied in @xcite and @xcite provide a road map for our study .",
    "however , the extension from the cases of two and three variables to the general @xmath1-variables is far from a trivial exercise . in order to carry out our program on the discrete analysis , it is essential that we have a complete understanding of the boundary of the fundamental domain and its congruent relations under the group . for the step 3 , we also need to understand the boundary of the simplex and its relation with the fundamental domain . in @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we can grasp the geometry of the hexagon and the rhombic dodecahedron by looking at their graphs and understand the relative positions between faces , edges and vertices , which are all parts of the boundary of the domain .",
    "this is not going to be the case in @xmath19 for @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath19 we will have to rely on the group theory and describe the boundary elements by working with subgroups .",
    "the study in the cases of @xmath38 and @xmath34 has revealed much of what can be done and they will serve as examples throughout the paper .    the generalized cosine and sine functions on the simplex , as well as the generalized chebyshev polynomials , have been studied before in the literature .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath38 , they are first studied by koornwinder in @xcite , who started with the eigenfunctions of the laplace operator and showed that the generalized chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal on the region bounded by the steiner s hypocycloid . later these polynomials are generated and studied by several authors ( see @xcite and the reference therein ) , often as eigenfunctions of certain differential operators . in @xcite , they appear as eigenfunctions of the radial part of the laplacian - beltrami operator on certain symmetric spaces .",
    "we highly recommend the article @xcite , which also includes a detailed account on the history of these polynomials .",
    "furthermore , the generalized chebyshev polynomials belong to large families of special functions ( see , for example , @xcite ) , just as the classical chebyshev polynomials are the special cases of jacobi polynomials .",
    "this , however , appears to have little bearing with our study in this paper .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that our aim is to develop a discrete fourier analysis on the generalized chebyshev polynomials , which come down to study common zeros of these polynomials , a topic that does not seem to have been studied systematically before .",
    "there are other types of discrete fourier analysis in several variables . for the multiple fourier analysis , with lattice @xmath20",
    ", there is a rich collection of literature as it is essentially the tensor product of one dimensional results . among others ,",
    "we mention the recent work on anti - symmetric exponential and trigonometric functions by klimyk and patera , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall recall the basic facts on lattice and tiling , and describe the framework for the discrete fourier analysis established in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we study the case of @xmath2 lattice and carry out both the step 2 and the step 3 of our program .",
    "the best way to describe the @xmath2 lattice and its fundamental domain appears to be using homogeneous coordinates , which amounts to regard @xmath19 as the hyperplane @xmath39 of @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , the group @xmath33 becomes permutation group @xmath41 in homogeneous coordinates . in section 4",
    "we establish a discrete fourier analysis on the simplex , which studies trigonometric polynomials on the standard simplex in @xmath19 .",
    "one of the concrete result is a lagrange interpolation by trigonometric polynomial on equal spaced points on the simplex , which can be computed by a compact formula and has an operator norm , called the lebesgue constant , in the order of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we derive the basic properties of the generalized chebyshev polynomials of the first and the second kind , and study their common zeros , which are related intrinsically to the cubature formula for algebraic polynomials . in particular , it is known that a gaussian cubature exists if and only if the set of its nodes is exactly the variety of the ideal generated by the orthogonal polynomials of degree @xmath11 , which however happens rarely and only one single family of examples is known in the literature .",
    "we will show that this is the case for the generalized chebyshev polynomials of the second kind , so that a gaussian cubature formula exists for the weight function with respect to which the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are orthogonal , which provides the second family of examples for such a cubature .",
    "in this section we recall results on discrete fourier analysis associated with lattice .",
    "background and the content of the first subsection can be found in @xcite .",
    "main results , stated in the second subsection , are developed in @xcite but will be reformulated somewhat , for which explanation will be given .",
    "we will be brief and refer the proof and further discussions to @xcite .",
    "we will consider lattices on @xmath19 but will use homogeneous coordinates , which amounts to identify @xmath19 with the hyperplane @xmath42 in @xmath40 . for convenience , we will state the results on the lattices on a @xmath1-dimensional subspace @xmath43 of the euclidean space @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
