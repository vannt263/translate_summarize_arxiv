    "we will concentrate our attention on the chiral even ( helicity conserving ) distribution @xmath0 for partons of flavor @xmath1 at the hadronic scale where the models we are going to discuss are assumed to be valid to evaluate the twist - two amplitude .",
    "the invariant momentum square is @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the quark light - cone momentum fraction with respect to the average nucleon momentum @xmath4 , and the skewedness @xmath5 describes the longitudinal change of the nucleon momentum , @xmath6 . in the following the dependence on the scale @xmath7",
    "is understood .",
    "we also introduce non - singlet ( valence ) and singlet quark distributions , [ eq : a12 ] h^ns ( x , , t ) _ q = h^ns ( -x , , t ) , h^s ( x , , t ) _ q = - h^s ( -x , , t ) , respectively . besides being symmetric or antisymmetric in @xmath3 , they are also symmetric under @xmath8 due to the polynomiality property  @xcite .",
    "the analogous gpd for gluons is symmetric in @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath9 , and reduces to the gluon density @xmath10 in the forward limit ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we will assume a factorized @xmath14 dependence determined by some form factor , and parametrize the @xmath14-dependent part in terms of double distributions ( dds ) involving a given profile function and the forward parton distribution @xmath15 derived in some model .",
    "at the hadronic scale @xmath16 , where the short range ( perturbative ) part of the interaction is negligible and , therefore , the glue and sea are suppressed , the long range ( confining ) part of the interaction produces a proton composed by ( three ) valence quarks , mainly  @xcite .",
    "therefore quark models are suitable to construct the parton distribution at the scale @xmath16  @xcite .    according to the method discussed in two recent papers  @xcite along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , we evaluate the valence contribution @xmath17 to the parton distribution within relativistic light - front constituent quark models ( cqms ) at the scale @xmath16 .",
    "this distribution automatically fulfills the support condition and satisfies the ( particle ) baryon number and momentum sum rules .",
    "results presented here are obtained for the hypercentral cqm  @xcite .",
    "the meson - cloud model introduces the sea by incorporating @xmath18 contributions into the valence - quark model of the parton distribution discussed in the previous section .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the meson - cloud model is that the physical nucleon state can be expanded ( in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) and in the one - meson approximation ) in a series involving bare nucleons and two - particle , meson - baryon states  @xcite .",
    "we will consider fluctuations of the proton including both pion - nucleon and pion - delta states .",
    "the partonic content of the @xmath19 and the pion will be consistently evaluated within the same scheme assuming light - front dynamics and valence contributions only .",
    "the quark distributions in a physical proton are then given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the contribution coming from the meson - baryon fluctuations , and @xmath22 is a suitable renormalization constant .    matching the sea , valence and gluon distributions within the radiative parton model we start evolution with continuous functions all over the range @xmath23 and identify the matching scale @xmath24 gev@xmath25 consistent with qcd evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "results are presented in this section according to the model based on dds .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence is dropped from the very beginning and could be reintroduced in the final results by an appropriate @xmath14-dependent factor .",
    "the d - term is omitted as well .",
    "the qcd evolution was numerically performed to nlo accuracy according to a modified version of the code of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see  @xcite for further details and results ) .",
    "the singlet quark , non - singlet quark and gluon gpds obtained in the model have been studied as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 . with no initial gluons and an input parton distribution given by @xmath17",
    "the model already gives a nonvanishing contribution to quark gpds in the erbl region @xmath26 at the hadronic scale without introducing discontinuities at @xmath27 and with a weak @xmath5 dependence .",
    "in particular , the absence of the sea contribution gives @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "after evolution up to @xmath30 gev@xmath25 gpds are almost confined into the erbl region with a significant @xmath5 dependence .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figuno ] results are shown for qcd evolution up to @xmath30 gev@xmath25 of the singlet quark , non - singlet quark and gluon gpds obtained with the parton distributions of the hypercentral cqm and including the sea contribution at the initial scale @xmath24 gev@xmath25 .",
    "the distributions are plotted at @xmath31 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the largest effects of evolution modify the input gpds within the first few gev@xmath25 in the @xmath7 evolution , @xmath30 gev@xmath25 being a value where gpds have already reached a stable configuration with respect to their asymptotic shape .",
    "the model already gives a nonvanishing gluon contribution at the hadronic scale .",
    "under evolution as the resolution scale increases the distributions are again swept from the dglap domain to lie almost fully within the erbl region .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that functions with support entirely in the time - like erbl region are never pushed out of the erbl domain .",
    "in fact , the evolution in the erbl region depends on the dglap region , whereas the dglap evolution is independent of the erbl region . the qualitative result after evolution is similar to the case without the sea  @xcite in spite of a more pronounced @xmath5 dependence of @xmath32 at the input hadronic scale and a shape of @xmath33 sensitive to the input at @xmath34 .",
    "the present results focus on the erbl region as the most interesting one to look at the nonperturbative effects surviving evolution .",
    "this is suggesting that one has to investigate suitable processes under appropriate kinematic conditions to study such effects .",
    "this research is part of the eu integrated infrastructure initiative hadronphysics project under contract number rii3-ct-2004 - 506078 and was partially supported by the italian miur through the prin theoretical physics of the nucleus and the many - body sytems",
