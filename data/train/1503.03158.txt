    "the distances @xmath21 and @xmath16 between interacting nuclei were varied to find the minimum values of the potential wells of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , which are affected by the coulomb interaction @xmath53 of the border fragments .",
    "the driving potential as a function of the charge and mass numbers of two fragments was obtained at the values of the distances @xmath49 and @xmath50 that correspond to the minimum values of the nucleus - nucleus interactions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .    in order to find the dominant cluster states of the tns ,",
    "the driving potential @xmath89 was calculated for the values of the charge ( mass ) numbers of the two fragments in the ranges of @xmath45 and @xmath151 [ @xmath47 and the @xmath48 .",
    "the analysis of the results allows us to find the mass number @xmath24 corresponding to the minimum value of the pes for a given value of @xmath23 . the calculated total potential energy as a function of @xmath42 enabled us to establish the three dimensional driving potential that demonstrates the configurations of tns with probable cluster states in the pre - fission states .",
    "finally , the contour lines of the three dimensional driving potential showed the structure of a valley corresponding to the formation of the outer cluster with @xmath152 or @xmath153 at the ternary fission , which corresponds to the fission channel of @xmath98{cf } \\to \\nuclide[]{f}_1 + \\nuclide[]{f}_3 + \\nuclide[132]{sn}$ ] .",
    "it was found that the valley extends up to the area of about @xmath99 and the probability of a configuration having lower potential energy for the tns is large .",
    "therefore , the configuration of @xmath100{ni } + \\nuclide[]{ca } + \\nuclide[]{sn}$ ] has a large probability in comparison with the configuration of @xmath100{ca } + \\nuclide[]{ni } + \\nuclide[]{sn}$ ] since the pes value of the latter configuration is about 12  mev higher than that of the former configuration .",
    "the dependence of the velocity of the middle cluster on the mass numbers @xmath54 and @xmath14 was also analyzed for the case of the collinear tripartition of .",
    "the main physical reason associated with the collinear tripartition is the smallness of the missed third product .",
    "we found that , in the range of the mass numbers @xmath125@xmath126 and @xmath154@xmath2 , the middle fragment has a very small velocity , which is in agreement with the observed range of values presented in  refs .",
    "this means that it is indeed difficult to observe the middle product of a collinear tripartition of producing with the second product having a mass number of @xmath154@xmath2 . in the case of the symmetric masses , @xmath135",
    ", we have a small velocity of the middle fragment @xmath15 , namely , we get @xmath136@xmath137  cm / ns . the smallness of the middle cluster velocity may be a reason of its missing in the collinear tripartition in the @xmath8cf(sf , fff ) @xcite and @xmath9u(n@xmath10,fff ) @xcite reactions .",
    "the mass ranges of the two outer products , where the middle fragment can be observed , are i ) @xmath138@xmath139 and @xmath155@xmath2 which corresponds to the well - known ternary fission with an emission of the light nucleus with @xmath140@xmath143  @xcite and ii ) @xmath156@xmath157 and @xmath158@xmath159 .",
