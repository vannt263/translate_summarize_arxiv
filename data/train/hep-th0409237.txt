    "this letter briefly reports our investigation on vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the exponential field @xmath1 in the sine - gordon ( sg ) field theory , @xmath2 , with variational perturbation theory ( vpt ) . here , @xmath0 is a parameter , and @xmath3 is the field operator at the 2-dimensional euclidean space ( 2des ) point @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the euclidean time ) .    in 1997 , starting from the exact expressions for the three special cases : the coupling @xmath6 ( semi - classical limit ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , lukyanov and zamolodchikov guessed an exact formula for the vev of @xmath1 in the sg field theory at any @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "then , defining  fully connected \" one - point functions , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is any natural number ) , from the vev s of even - power fields @xmath13 , they showed that @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the above - mentioned exact formula agree with those from perturbation theory for the sg field theory up to @xmath16 and that @xmath14 agrees with the corresponding one - point function from perturbation theory up to @xmath17 the coupling in the massive thirring model , which is the fermion version of the sg field theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based on the reflection relations with liouville reflection amplitude @xcite , some extra arguments for supporting the conjectured exact formula were presented by their collaborators with them in the subsequent papers @xcite . slightly later , in 2000 , checks from perturbation theories in both an angular and a radial quantization approaches for the massive thirring model indicated that the perturbation result up to @xmath17 exactly coincides with the corresponding result obtained by expanding the exact formula according to the coupling @xmath17 @xcite",
    ". additionally , a numerical study for the model in finite volume also provides evidence for the the conjectured exact formula @xcite .",
    "thus , these investigations have given the conjectured exact formula for the vev of @xmath1 a complete check for the case of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath20 , from eq.(8 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and some indirect evidences for its validity . obviously , a direct check for the cases of @xmath21 ( ref .",
    "@xcite has provided a partial check for the case of @xmath6 ) is still needed .",
    "in fact , vpt @xcite may provide such a check .",
    "it is some kind of expansion theory similar to the perturbation theory .",
    "however , because it properly  grafts \" the variational approach onto the perturbation theory , the vpt produces non - perturbative results which are valid for any coupling strength , including both weak and strong couplings . moreover , because the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite is used to determine a man - made parameter , the vpt is believed to be a convergent theory , and its approximate accuracy can be systematically controlled and improved to tend towards the exact @xcite .",
    "the primitive idea of vpt is not a new one and can date back to 1955 at least @xcite .",
    "now , it has developed with many equivalent practical schemes , and has been applied to quantum field theory ( qft ) , condensed matter physics , statistical mechanics , chemical physics , and so on @xcite . in this letter , based on the variational perturbation scheme in one of our former joint papers @xcite ( the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite was stemmed from the okopinska s optimized expansion @xcite , and proposed by stancu and stevenson @xcite ) , we will develop a variational perturbation scheme for the purpose of the present letter and calculate approximately @xmath2 up to the second order .",
    "no explicit divergences exist in the resultant expression owing to the adoption of the coleman s normal - ordering renormalization prescription @xcite .",
    "one will see that our investigation strongly support the conjectured exact formula .",
    "next section , we will develop the vpt to calculate the vev of @xmath1 and give the vev of @xmath1 up to the second order in vpt . in section iii",
    ", we will report our numerical results and make a numerical comparison between our results and the exact ones .",
    "a brief conclusion will be made in sect . v.",
    "we consider the 2-dimensional euclidean sg field theory with the following lagrangian density @xmath22 in this letter , the subscript @xmath23 represents the coordinate argument , for example , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the gradient in the 2des .",
    "the lagrangian density eq.(1 ) is nothing but eq.(5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite if one makes the transform @xmath26 ( hereafter , we will use @xmath27 instead of @xmath1 and consequently the parameter @xmath0 and the coupling @xmath28 in this letter are identical to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively ) .",
    "if taking @xmath29 and @xmath30 and adding the term @xmath31 in the lagrangian density , one will get the euclidean version of the sg lagrangian density which discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in eq.(1 ) , the dimensionless @xmath28 is the coupling parameter and @xmath32 is another parameter with the dimension [ lenth@xmath33^{-2}$ ] in the natural unit system .",
    "it is always viable to have @xmath34 without loss of generality .",
    "the classical potential @xmath35 is invariant under the transform @xmath36 with any integer @xmath12 , and so the classical vacua are infinitely degenerate .",
    "so do the quantum vacua of the sg field theory according to ref.@xcite . here ,",
    "as did in ref.@xcite , we choose to consider the symmetry vacuum with the expectation value of the sg field operator @xmath37 vanishing instead of those spontaneous symmetry broken vacua .",
    "the vev of the exponential field @xmath27 is defined as follows @xcite @xmath38 for simplicity , the exponential field in eq.(2 ) is taken at @xmath39 .",
    "it is evident that the numerator and denominator in the right hand side of eq.(2 ) can easily be got from the following sg generating functional @xmath40=\\int { \\cal d}\\phi \\exp\\{-\\int d^2 \\vec{r}\\ ; [ { \\cal l}_{sg}-j_{\\vec{r}}\\phi_{\\vec{r}}\\ ; ] \\ }   \\ ; , \\ ] ] by taking @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 , respectively . in eq.(3 ) , @xmath44 is an external source at @xmath23 . for renormalizing @xmath2",
    ", we will use its normal - ordering form @xcite .    to perform a variational perturbation expansion on @xmath2 ,",
    "now we modify @xmath45 $ ] in eq.(3 ) by following ref .",
    "@xcite only without shifting the field @xmath37 ( this is not necessary here because we choose to consider the symmetrical vacuum as aforementioned ) .",
    "that is , first introduce a parameter @xmath46 by adding a vanishing term @xmath47 into the exponent of the functional integral in eq.(3 ) , then rearrange the exponent into a free - field part plus a new interacting part , and finally insert a formal expansion factor @xmath48 before the interacting part .",
    "consequently , one has @xmath49\\to z[j;\\epsilon]&=&\\exp\\{-\\int d^2 \\vec{r}\\ ; [ { \\frac { 1}{2 } } i_{(0)}(\\mu^2)-{\\frac { 1}{2}}i_{(0)}({\\cal m}^2)+{\\frac { 1}{2}}{\\cal m}^2 i_{(1)}({\\cal m}^2)]\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\exp\\{-\\epsilon\\int d^2 \\vec{r}\\ ; { \\cal h}_i({\\frac { \\delta}{\\delta j_{\\vec{r}}}},\\mu)\\ } \\exp\\{{\\frac { 1}{2}}jf^{-1}j\\ } \\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is a normal - ordering mass , @xmath52 with @xmath53 a euclidean momentum in 2des , and @xmath54 with @xmath55 in eq.(6 ) , @xmath56 is the @xmath12th - order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "note that eq.(4 ) in the extrapolating case of @xmath57 is only the normal - ordering expression of eq.(3 ) .",
    "expanding @xmath58 in eq.(4 ) with taylor series of the exponential , one can write normal - ordered @xmath2 as @xmath59_{j_{\\vec{r}}=i \\sqrt{8\\pi}a \\delta(\\vec{r})}}{\\bigl[\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\epsilon^n { \\frac { ( -1)^{n}}{n ! } } \\int \\prod_{k=1}^n d^2 \\vec{r}_k { \\cal h}_i({\\frac { \\delta}{\\delta j_{\\vec{r}_k}}},\\mu )       \\exp\\{{\\frac { 1}{2}}jf^{-1}j\\}\\bigl]_{j=0}}}\\biggl|_{\\epsilon=1 } \\;.\\ ] ] thus , according to the formula 0.313 on page 14 in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath2 can be expanded as the following series of @xmath48 @xmath60_{\\epsilon=1 } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    this series with @xmath57 is independent of the man - made parameter @xmath46 , but to get its closed form is beyond our ability .",
    "hence one can truncate it at any order of @xmath48 to approximate it and then the truncated results will be dependent upon @xmath46 .",
    "this arbitrary parameter @xmath46 should be determined according to the pms @xcite as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "that is , under the pms , @xmath46 will be chosen from roots which make the first ( or second ) derivative of the truncated result with respect to @xmath46 vanish @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath46 will depend on the truncated order .",
    "it is believed that it is this dependence that makes the truncated result approach the exact @xmath2 order by order @xcite .",
    "thus the above procedure provides an approximate method of calculating @xmath2 which can systematically control its approximation accuracy .",
    "it is evident that this procedure has no limits to the model coupling and is a non - perturbative method .    executing the above procedure",
    ", we have truncated the series in eq.(8 ) at the second order of @xmath48 , and the three coefficients are @xmath61_{j_{\\vec{r}}=i \\sqrt{8\\pi}a \\delta(\\vec{r } ) } \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath62_{j_{\\vec{r}}=i \\sqrt{8\\pi}a \\delta(\\vec{r } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + g_a^{(0)}\\biggl[\\int d^2 \\vec{r } { \\cal h}_i({\\frac { \\delta}{\\delta j_{r}}},\\mu)\\exp\\{{\\frac { 1}{2}}jf^{-1}j\\}\\biggl]_{j_{\\vec{r}}=0 } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath63_{j_{\\vec{r}}=i \\sqrt{8\\pi}a \\delta(\\vec{r})}\\nonumber \\\\ & & -{\\frac { 1}{2!}}g_a^{(0)}\\biggl[\\int d^2 \\vec{r}_1 d^2 \\vec{r}_2 { \\cal h}_i({\\frac { \\delta}{\\delta j_{\\vec{r}_1}}},\\mu){\\cal h}_i({\\frac { \\delta}{\\delta j_{\\vec{r}_2}}},\\mu)\\exp\\{{\\frac { 1}{2}}jf^{-1}j\\ } \\biggl]_{j_{\\vec{r}}=0 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + g_a^{(1)}\\biggl[\\int d^2 \\vec{r } { \\cal h}_i({\\frac { \\delta}{\\delta j_{r}}},\\mu ) \\exp\\{{\\frac { 1}{2}}jf^{-1}j\\}\\biggl]_{j_{\\vec{r}}=0}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .    performing carefully operations in eqs.(9),(10 ) and ( 11 ) , we obtain the following expression of @xmath2 approximated up to the second order of @xmath48 , @xmath64_{\\epsilon=1}$ ] , @xmath65 where , @xmath66\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath67 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath68\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{5cm}[\\cosh(4 a \\beta ( k_0(\\rho_1)+k_0(\\rho_2)))-1 ]   \\ ; , \\\\",

    ", we can require that @xmath72 according to the pms , and have @xmath73 thus , substituting last equation into the expression of @xmath71 gives approximately the result of @xmath2 up to the first order in vpt .",
    "note that @xmath51 can be taken as any positive value , and usually it can be referred to as unit when one renders various quantities dimensionless for numerical calculations .",
    "as for @xmath46 at the second order , following the next section , one can numerically check that the condition @xmath74 does not produce a real @xmath75 for a real value of @xmath0 .",
    "however , for a real @xmath0 , @xmath2 should be real because eve s of odd - power fields in the sg field theory vanish ( see eq.(2 ) ) .",
    "hence we have to resort to @xmath76 for determining @xmath46 at this order ( note that @xmath46 enters the scheme in its squared power @xmath75 ) .",
    "fortunately , @xmath46 can explicitly be obtained with a long expression from this condition , and then the approximate @xmath2 up to the second order in vpt can be concretely given from eq.(12 ) .    in the same way",
    ", one can approximately give @xmath2 up to higher orders .",
    "here we do not continue to consider it , and next section we will carry out a numerical calculation on the first and the second order results .    in passing , @xmath77 in eq.(8 ) is only the sum of all @xmath12th - order connected feynman diagrams consisting of the external vertices from @xmath78 and @xmath12 vertices from @xmath79 .",
    "hence , one can also obtain the above results eq.(12 ) by borrowing feynman diagrammatic technique with the propagator of eq.(6 ) .",
    "to perform numerical calculations , we take @xmath80 and all physical quantities in eq.(12 ) and ( 13 ) are dimensionless .",
    "simultaneously , one can check that this treatment ( taking @xmath81 ) amounts to taking the same normalization conditions as eqs.(6 ) and ( 16 ) in ref .",
    "thus , our results can be compared with the exact formula . from eq.(12 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dimensionless @xmath32 in eqs.(12 ) and ( 13 ) can be written as @xmath82^{2 - 2\\beta^2}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 .",
    "in last equation , we took the soliton mass as unit to make @xmath32 dimensionless . for comparisons ,",
    "we also do so for the conjectured exact formula eq.(20 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite,@xmath84 , when it is employed .",
    "now we first report numerical results up to the first order .",
    "mathematica5.0 programm gives that @xmath85 and @xmath86 is finite for the case of @xmath87 which is involved in the range of @xmath88 for the conjectured exact formula .",
    "taking @xmath89 and @xmath90 as examples , we compared our results @xmath71 with the conjectured exact results of ref .",
    "@xcite in figs.1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "comparison between the first - order ( @xmath91 , solid curve ) and conjectured exact ( @xmath84 , dashed curve ) sg expectation values of exponential fields at @xmath89 . ]     similar to fig.1 but at @xmath92 . ]    in fig.1 and fig.2 , the solid curves are @xmath91 , and the dashed curves are @xmath84 .",
    "in fig.1 , @xmath2 decreases from @xmath93 to @xmath94 with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "this tendency exists in the case of @xmath95 or so .",
    "when @xmath96 and @xmath97 , eq.(13 ) will produce a complex @xmath75 and one should use the second derivative for determining @xmath46 . for sufficiently small",
    "@xmath28 , one need nt do so because @xmath2 tends to zero with the increase of @xmath0 before @xmath75 approaches complex values . in fig.2 , @xmath2 increases almost from @xmath93 with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "this tendency appears for other larger values of @xmath28 .",
    "these figures indicate that for the case of @xmath98 or so , the first - order results almost completely agree with the conjectured exact results , and for larger @xmath0 , our results differ from the exact results with about ten percents or so ( at most with 20 more percents when @xmath0 approaches values with @xmath99 satisfied , see table i ) .    for calculating @xmath100 , we need to calculate integrals in eq.(12 ) which are involved in the zeroth order modified bessel functions of the second kind .",
    "noting gegenbauer s addition formula for the zeroth - order modified bessel functions of the second kind @xcite @xmath101i_n(\\rho_1)k_n(\\rho_2)$ ] with @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is the @xmath12th - order modified bessel functions of the first kind ) , one can finish those integrals by dividing the plane \\{@xmath104,@xmath105 } into two parts : one part with @xmath102 and the other with @xmath106 . in performing the calculations ,",
    "because of the oscillatory property of @xmath107 $ ] , it is enough to truncate the series in the gegenbauer s addition formula at some @xmath12 . finishing those integrals for @xmath92 with long - time calculations of mathematica5.0 system",
    ", we obtained the results of @xmath100 and accordingly compared them with @xmath91 and the conjectured exact results in the table .",
    ".comparisons : @xmath100 , @xmath91 and @xmath84 for @xmath92 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table i , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this table indicates that @xmath100 has an about one percent smaller difference from the conjectured exact result than @xmath71 at @xmath92 .",
    "we also checked the cases of smaller and larger @xmath28 ( @xmath110 ) , and found the same conclusion .",
    "in this letter , in order to check the conjectured exact formula in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have calculated the sg expectation value of the exponential field @xmath1 up to the second order with variational perturbation approach . according to our numerical results in last section , for not large @xmath0 , the exact formula conjectured by lukyanov and zamolodchikov in ref .",
    "@xcite is correct for all values of @xmath28 in the range of @xmath9 , and for larger @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) , our numerical results can be believed to support the conjectured exact formula since our method is an approximate one .",
    "thus , from the existed reports in refs .",
    "@xcite and our report here , we believe that the conjectured exact formula in ref .  @xcite is completely convincible .    as ending the present letter , we mention some interesting problems .",
    "the normal - ordering prescription amounts to a renormalization procedure on the mass parameter and makes @xmath91 finite for the range of @xmath88 . if introducing additional renormalization scheme on the coupling @xmath28 and the exponential - field parameter @xmath0 , it will be possible to obtain a finite @xmath2 for the range of @xmath111",
    "furthermore , it will be also interesting to calculate the sg expectation values of the exponential fields on the asymmetrical vacua . on the other hand , because it was an important progress in calculating vev s of local fields , the lukyanov - zamolodchikov conjecture in ref .",
    "@xcite has stimulated generalizations or conjectures on the vev s of local fields in some field theories @xcite , and hence the method in the present letter and its generalization to finite temperature case can be used to check or confirm those generalizations or conjectures in ref .",
    "besides , although our results up to the second order improved the results up to the first order , table i indicates that the improvement is small .",
    "since the lukyanov - zamolodchikov conjecture can be believed to be correct , comparing it with higher - order contributions in vpt for the sg expectation values of the exponential fields will provide the first check in qft on the convergency of vpt .",
