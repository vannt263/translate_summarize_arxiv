    "even if @xmath31 decreases , it will overtake @xmath97 when @xmath66 , then @xmath68 increases again . once @xmath68 increases away from zero",
    ", we will have @xmath95 and the tracker behavior of @xmath0 will be reached , maybe after several oscillations .",
    "if @xmath90 is small , then to satisfy the tracker condition , @xmath89 can not be too small and @xmath1 may reach @xmath98 very quickly and the tracker solution with nearly constant @xmath0 will not appear .",
    "( b ) initially if @xmath89 or @xmath90 is small so that @xmath99 , then @xmath68 decreases toward 0 and @xmath1 starts to increase once @xmath96 independent of the initial value @xmath100 .",
    "after that , the dynamics is similar to that in case ( a ) . in this case , even though @xmath89 is small , but it always increases if @xmath90 is small , @xmath1 will reach 1 soon and the tracker solution with nearly constant @xmath0 does not appear .",
    "of course , the current values of @xmath1 , @xmath31 and @xmath0 depend on their initial values . from these analyses , we conclude that if the initial value of @xmath31 is small , then no tracker solution with nearly constant @xmath0 appears because @xmath1 reaches 1 too soon . for small @xmath90 , once @xmath1 reaches 1 , the equation for @xmath1 decouples from the dynamical system ( [ dynaeq1a])-([dynaeq3a ] ) .",

    "the conditions ( [ trkcond ] ) and ( [ trksol2 ] ) are the initial conditions , so for the same initial value of @xmath1 at the start of the tracking solution , the trajectories of @xmath0 , @xmath1 an @xmath31 will be the same , that is why we have the same @xmath2 trajectory for the tracking solution independent of the initial conditions . however , the exact values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at a moment ( for instance , at the present ) still depend on the initial conditions . _",
    "we refer the tracking solutions as those solutions which have a common @xmath2 trajectory for a wide range of initial conditions , technically , the tracking solutions satisfy the two conditions ( [ trkcond ] ) and ( [ trksol2 ] ) initially_.    in @xcite , the author rephrased the tracker theorem as : the tracker property appears for any scalar field model in which the roll parameter @xmath31 is capable of taking on large initial values in the early universe .",
    "if @xmath31 decreases with time , then @xmath31 is capable of taking on large initial values in the early universe .",
    "however , for the power - law potential @xmath102 with @xmath103 , the roll parameter @xmath31 can be large if we start from small @xmath9 , and there is no tracking solution .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how large the initial value should be",
    ". therefore , we propose the tracker theorem as : _ the tracker behavior appears for any quintessence field in which the roll parameter @xmath74 does not increase with time and the initial value of @xmath31 should be big enough so that @xmath1 is still negligible when the tracker condition ( [ trkcond ] ) is satisfied_. the new definition of the tracking solution and the tracker theorem proposed here are parts of the main results of this letter .",
    "in this section , we use the power - law potential as an example to explicitly show the analyses presented in the previous section . here",
    "we focus on the tracking and thawing behaviors and the bound on @xmath3 . for the power - law potential @xmath104 with the energy scale @xmath105 and the planck mass @xmath106 , the tracker parameter @xmath107 , so the dynamical system becomes an autonomous system .",
