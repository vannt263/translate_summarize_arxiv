    "dynamical systems are now ubiquitous and are vital in modeling complex systems , especially when they admit recurrence relations . statistical inference for dynamical systems has drawn continuous attention across various fields , the topics of which include parameter estimation , invariant measure estimation , forecasting , noise detection , among others . for instance , in the statistics and machine learning community , the statistical inference for certain dynamical systems have been recently studied in @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "we refer the reader to a recent survey in @xcite for a general depiction of this topic .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the density estimation problem for dynamical systems via a classical nonparametric approach , i.e. , kernel density estimation .",
    "the commonly considered density estimation problem can be stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 be observations drawn independently from an unknown distribution @xmath7 on @xmath8 with the density @xmath2 . density estimation is concerned with the estimation of the underlying density @xmath2 .",
    "accurate estimation of the density is important for many machine learning tasks such as regression , classification , and clustering problems and also plays an important role in many real - world applications .",
    "nonparametric density estimators are popular since weaker assumptions are applied to the underlying probability distribution .",
    "typical nonparametric density estimators include the histogram and kernel density estimator . in this study , we are interested in the latter one , namely , _ kernel density estimator _ , which is also termed as _ parzen - rosenblatt estimator _ @xcite and takes the following form @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is a bandwidth parameter and @xmath11 is a smoothing kernel . in the literature , point - wise and uniform consistency and convergence rates of the estimator @xmath12 to the unknown truth density @xmath2 under various distance measurements , e.g. , @xmath13 ,",
    "have been established by resorting to the regularity assumptions on the smoothing kernel @xmath14 , the density @xmath2 , as well as the decay of the bandwidth sequence @xmath15 . besides the theoretical concerns on the consistency and convergence rates , another practical issue one usually needs to address",
    "is the choice of the bandwidth parameter @xmath16 , which is also called the _ smoothing parameter_. it plays a crucial role in the bias - variance trade - off in kernel density estimation . in the literature ,",
    "approaches to choosing the smoothing parameter include least - squares cross - validation @xcite , biased cross - validation @xcite , plug - in method @xcite , the double kernel method @xcite , as well as the method based on a discrepancy principle @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a general overview and to @xcite for more detailed reviews .",
    "note that studies on the kernel density estimator mentioned above heavily rely on the assumption that the observations are drawn in an i.i.d fashion . in the literature of statistics and machine learning",
    ", it is commonly accepted that the i.i.d assumption on the given data can be very much restrictive in real - world applications .",
    "having realized this , researchers turn to weaken this i.i.d assumption by assuming that the observations are weakly dependent under various notions of weakly dependence which include @xmath17-mixing , @xmath18-mixing , and @xmath19-mixing @xcite .",
    "there has been a flurry of work to attack this problem with theoretical and practical concerns , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , under the above notions of dependence . as a matter of fact",
    ", the assumed correlation among the observations complicates the kernel density estimation problem from a technical as well as practical view and also brings inherent barriers .",
    "this is because , more frequently , the analysis on the consistency and convergence rates of the kernel density estimator is proceeded by decomposing the error term into bias and variance terms , which correspond to data - free and data - dependent error terms , respectively .",
    "the data - free error term can be tackled by using techniques from the approximation theory while the data - dependent error term is usually dealt with by exploiting arguments from the empirical process theory such as concentration inequalities . as a result , due to the existence of dependence among observations and various notions of the dependence measurement ,",
    "the techniques , and results concerning the data - dependent error term are in general not universally applicable . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been also pointed out that the bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation under dependence also departures from the independent case , see e.g. , @xcite .    in fact ,",
    "when the observations @xmath20 are generated by certain ergodic measure - preserving dynamical systems , the problem of kernel density estimation can be even more involved .",
    "to explain , let us consider a discrete - time ergodic measure - preserving dynamical system described by the sequence @xmath21 of iterates of an unknown map @xmath22 with @xmath23 and a unique invariant measure @xmath7 which possesses a density @xmath2 with respect to the lebesgue measure ( rigorous definitions will be given in the sequel ) .",
    "that is , we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the initial state .",
    "it is noticed that in this case the usual mixing concepts are not general enough to characterize the dependence among observations generated by @xcite . on the other hand , existing theoretical studies on the consistency and convergence rates of the kernel density estimator for i.i.d .  observations frequently assume that the density function @xmath2 is sufficiently smooth , e.g. , first - order or even second - order smoothness . however , more often than not , this requirement can be stringent in the dynamical system context .",
    "for instance , the lasota - yorke map @xcite admits a density @xmath2 which only belongs to the space @xmath26 , i.e. , functions of bounded variation .",
    "this is also the case for the @xmath18-map in example [ beta_map ] ( see subsection [ sec::subsec::dynamicalsys ] ) .",
    "therefore , studies on kernel density estimation mentioned above with dependent observations , in general , may not be applicable .",
    "for more detailed comparison we refer to section [ candd ] .    in this study , the kernel density estimation problem with observations generated by dynamical systems is approached by making use of a more general concept for measuring the dependence of observations , namely , the so - called @xmath0-mixing process ( refer to section [ sec::preliminary ] for the definition ) .",
    "proposed in @xcite and recently investigated in @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath0-mixing concept is shown to be more general and powerful in measuring dependence among observations generated by dynamical systems and can accommodate a large class of dynamical systems .",
    "recently , a bernstein - type exponential inequality for @xmath0-mixing processes was established in @xcite and its applications to some learning schemes were explored in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to conduct some theoretical analysis and practical implementations on the kernel density estimator for dynamical systems .",
    "the primary concern is the consistency and convergence rates of the kernel density estimator with observations generated by dynamical systems .",
    "the consistency and convergence analysis is conducted under @xmath1-norm , and @xmath3-norm , respectively .",
    "we show that under mild assumptions on the smoothing kernel , with properly chosen bandwidth , the estimator is universally consistent under @xmath1-norm . when the probability distribution @xmath7 possesses a polynomial or exponential decay outside of a radius-@xmath27 ball in its support , under the hlder continuity assumptions on the kernel function and the density , we obtain almost optimal convergence rates under @xmath1-norm .",
    "moreover , when the probability distribution @xmath7 is compactly supported , which is a frequently encountered setting in the dynamical system context , we prove that stronger convergence results of the estimator can be developed , i.e. , convergence results under @xmath3-norm which are shown to be of the same order with its @xmath1-norm convergence rates . finally , with regard to the practical implementation of the estimator",
    ", we also discuss the bandwidth selection problem by performing numerical comparisons among several typical existing selectors that include least squares cross - validation and its variants for dependent observations as well as the double kernel method .",
    "we show that the double kernel bandwidth selector proposed in @xcite can in general work well .",
    "moreover , according to our numerical experiments , we find that bandwidth selection for kernel density estimator of dynamical systems is usually ad - hoc in the sense that its performance may depend on the considered dynamical system .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec::preliminary ] is a warm - up section for the introduction of some notations , definitions and assumptions that are related to the kernel density estimation problem and dynamical systems .",
    "section [ sec::consistency_convergence ] is concerned with the consistency and convergence of the kernel density estimator and presents the main theoretical results of this study .",
    "we discuss the bandwidth selection problem in section [ sec::bandwidth_selection ] .",
    "all the proofs of section [ sec::consistency_convergence ] can be found in section [ proofs ] .",
    "we end this paper in section [ sec::conclusion ] .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath28 is denoted as the lebesgue measure on @xmath8 and @xmath29 is an arbitrary norm on @xmath8 .",
    "we denote @xmath30 as the centered ball of @xmath8 with radius @xmath27 , that is , @xmath31 and its complement @xmath32 as @xmath33 recall that for @xmath34 , the @xmath35-norm is defined as @xmath36 , and the @xmath37-norm is defined as @xmath38 .",

    "we denote @xmath40 as the space of ( equivalence classes of ) measurable functions @xmath41 with finite @xmath42-norm @xmath43 .",

    "what follows , the notation @xmath52 means that there exists a positive constant @xmath53 such that @xmath54 , for all @xmath55 . with a slight abuse of notation , in this paper , @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "are used interchangeably for positive constants while their values may vary across different lemmas , theorems , and corollaries .      in this subsection",
    ", we first introduce the dynamical systems of interest , namely , ergodic measure - preserving dynamical systems .",
    "mathematically , an ergodic measure - preserving _ dynamical system _ is a system @xmath58 with a mapping @xmath59 that is measure - preserving , i.e. , @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , and ergodic , i.e. , @xmath62 implies @xmath63 or @xmath64 . in this study , we are confined to the dynamical systems in which @xmath65 is a subset of @xmath8 , @xmath66 is a probability measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath67 and admits a unique invariant lebesgue density @xmath2 .    in our study",
    ", it is assumed that the observations @xmath68 are generated by the discrete - time dynamical system .",

    "let @xmath79 be an @xmath80-valued stochastic process on @xmath81 , and for @xmath82 , denote by @xmath83 the @xmath46-algebra generated by @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a measurable map .",
    "@xmath86 is denoted as the @xmath87-image measure of @xmath66 , which is defined as @xmath88 , @xmath89 measurable .",
    "the process @xmath90 is called _ stationary _ if @xmath91 for all @xmath92 . denote @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath94 satisfying @xmath95 , we denote the correlation of @xmath96 and @xmath97 by @xmath98 it is shown that several dependency coefficients for @xmath90 can be expressed in terms of such correlations for restricted sets of functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xcite . in order to introduce the notion",
    ", we also need to define a new norm , which is taken from @xcite and introduces restrictions on @xmath96 and @xmath97 considered here .",
    "let us assume that @xmath99 is a subspace of bounded measurable functions @xmath100 and that we have a semi - norm @xmath101 on @xmath99 . for @xmath102 , we define the @xmath0-norm @xmath103 by @xmath104 additionally , we need to introduce the following restrictions on the semi - norm @xmath101 .",
    "[ seminorm_assump ] we assume that the following two restrictions on the semi - norm @xmath101 hold :    * @xmath105 for all constant functions @xmath102 ; * @xmath106 .    note that the first constraint on the semi - norm in assumption [ seminorm_assump ] implies its shift invariance on @xmath107 while the inequality constraint can be viewed as an abstract _ chain rule _ if one views the semi - norm as a norm describing aspects of the smoothness of @xmath108 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that the following function classes , which are probably also the most frequently considered in the dynamical system context , satisfy condition @xmath109 in assumption [ seminorm_assump ] .",
    "moreover , they also satisfy condition @xmath110 in assumption [ seminorm_assump ] , as shown in @xcite :    * @xmath111 : the class of bounded functions on @xmath80 ; * @xmath112 : the class of bounded variation functions on @xmath80 ; * @xmath113 : the class of bounded and @xmath17-hlder continuous functions on @xmath80 ; * @xmath114 : the class of lipschitz continuous functions on @xmath80 ; * @xmath115 : the class of continuously differentiable functions on @xmath80 .",

    "on the other hand , under the above notations and definitions , from theorem @xmath129 in @xcite , we know that logistic map in example [ logistic_map ] is geometrically time - reversed @xmath0-mixing with @xmath130 while theorem @xmath131 in @xcite ( see also chapter @xmath132 in @xcite ) indicates that gauss map in example [ gauss_map ] is geometrically time - reversed @xmath0-mixing with @xmath133 .",

    "therefore , easily we have @xmath142 in what follows , without loss of generality , we assume that the constant @xmath143 in definition [ kernel ] equals to @xmath64 .    [ lemma_kernel ] a bounded , monotonically decreasing function @xmath136 is a @xmath135-dimensional smoothing kernel if and only if @xmath144    from the above discussions , it suffices to consider the integration constraint for the kernel function @xmath11 with respect to the euclidean norm @xmath145 .",

    "moreover , as we shall see below , not all the conditions in assumption [ assump_kernel ] are required for the analysis conducted in this study and conditions assumed on the kernel will be specified explicitly .",
    "we now show that given a @xmath135-dimensional smoothing kernel @xmath11 as in definition [ kernel ] , one can easily construct a probability density on @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a @xmath135-dimensional smoothing kernel and @xmath166 be a probability measure on @xmath8 .",
    "then , for @xmath167 , @xmath168 is called a * @xmath11-smoothing of @xmath166*.    it is not difficult to see that @xmath169 defines a probability density on @xmath8 , since fubini s theorem yields that @xmath170 let us denote @xmath171 as @xmath172 note that @xmath173 also induces a density function on @xmath8 since there holds @xmath174 .    for the sake of notational simplification , in what follows , we introduce the convolution operator @xmath175 . under this notation , we then see that @xmath169 is the density of the measure that is the convolution of the measure @xmath166 and @xmath176 . recalling that @xmath7 is a probability measure on @xmath8 with the corresponding density function @xmath2 , by taking @xmath177 with @xmath178 , we have @xmath179 since @xmath180 and @xmath181 , from proposition ( 8.8 ) in @xcite we know that @xmath182 is uniformly continuous and bounded .",
    "specifically , when @xmath166 is the empirical measure @xmath183 , the _ kernel density estimator for dynamical systems _ in this study can be expressed as @xmath184 from now on , for notational simplicity , we will suppress the subscript @xmath185 of @xmath186 and denote @xmath187 , e.g. , @xmath188 .",
    "in this section , we study the consistency and convergence rates of @xmath189 to the true density @xmath2 under @xmath1-norm and also @xmath3-norm for some special cases . recall that @xmath189 is a nonparametric density estimator and",
    "so the criterion that measures its goodness - of - fit matters , which , for instance , includes @xmath1-distance , @xmath190-distance and @xmath3-distance .    in the literature of kernel density estimation , probably the most frequently employed criterion is the @xmath190-distance of the difference between @xmath189 and @xmath2 , since it entails an exact bias - variance decomposition and can be analyzed relatively easily by using taylor expansion involved arguments .",
    "however , it is argued in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath1-distance could be a more reasonable choice since : it is invariant under monotone transformations ; it is always well - defined as a metric on the space of density functions ; it is also proportional to the total variation metric and so leads to better visualization of the closeness to the true density function than @xmath190-distance .",
    "the downside of using @xmath1-distance is that it does not admit an exact bias - variance decomposition and the usual taylor expansion involved techniques for error estimation may not apply directly .",
    "nonetheless , if we introduce the intermediate estimator @xmath182 in , obviously the following inequality holds @xmath191 the consistency and convergence analysis in our study will be mainly conducted in the @xmath1 sense with the help of inequality .",
    "for some specific case , i.e. , when the density @xmath2 is compactly supported , we are also concerned with the consistency and convergence of @xmath189 to @xmath2 under @xmath3-norm . in this case , there also holds the following inequality @xmath192    it is easy to see that the first error term on the right - hand side of or is stochastic due to the empirical measure @xmath193 while the second one is deterministic because of its sampling - free nature . loosely speaking",
    ", the first error term corresponds to the variance of the estimator @xmath189 , while the second one can be treated as its bias although or is not an exact error decomposition . in our study , we proceed with the consistency and convergence analysis on @xmath189 by bounding the two error terms , respectively .      our first theoretical result on bounding the deterministic error term shows that , given a @xmath135-dimensional kernel @xmath11 , the @xmath1-distance between its @xmath11-smooth of the measure @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath182 , and @xmath2 can be arbitrarily small by choosing the bandwidth appropriately .",
    "moreover , under mild assumptions on the regularity of @xmath2 and @xmath11 , the @xmath3-distance between the two quantities possesses a polynomial decay with respect to the bandwidth @xmath194 .",

    "case , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "there exist several studies in the literature that address the kernel density estimation problem for dynamical systems .",
    "for example , @xcite conducted some first studies and showed the point - wise consistency as well as convergence ( in expectation ) of the kernel density estimator .",
    "the convergence rates obtained in their study are of the type @xmath277 , which are conducted in terms of the variance of @xmath189 .",
    "the notion they used for measuring the dependence among observations is @xmath17-mixing coefficient ( see @xmath278 in @xcite ) . considering the density estimation problem for one - dimensional dynamical systems",
    ", @xcite presented some studies on the kernel density estimator @xmath189 by developing a central limit theorem and apply it to bound the variance of the estimator . further some studies on the kernel density estimation of the invariant lebesgue density for dynamical systems were conducted in @xcite . by considering both dynamical noise and observational noise , point - wise convergence of the estimator @xmath189 in expectation",
    "was established , i.e. , the convergence of @xmath279 for any @xmath280 .",
    "note further that these results rely on the second - order smoothness and boundedness of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the second - order smoothness assumption on the density function together with the point - wise convergence in expectation makes it different from our work .",
    "in particular , under the additional assumption on the tail of the noise distribution , the convergence of @xmath281 for any fixed @xmath280 is of the order @xmath282 with @xmath283 . concerning the convergence of @xmath189 in a dynamical system setup",
    ", @xcite also presented some interesting studies which in some sense also motivated our work here . by using also the @xmath0-mixing concept as adopted in our study to measure the dependence among observations from dynamical systems , she presented the point - wise convergence of @xmath189 with the help of hoeffding - type exponential inequality ( see proposition 3.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption applied on @xmath2 is that it is bounded from below and also @xmath17-hlder continuous ( more precisely , @xmath2 is assumed to be _",

    "this section discusses the model selection problem of the kernel density estimator by performing numerical simulation studies . in the context of kernel density estimation , model selection",
    "is mainly referred to the choice of the smoothing kernel @xmath11 and the selection of the kernel bandwidth @xmath194 , which are of crucial importance for the practical implementation of the data - driven density estimator . according to our experimental experience and also the empirical observations reported in @xcite",
    ", it seems that the choice of the kernel or the noise does not have a significant influence on the performance of the estimator .",
    "therefore , our emphasis will be placed on the bandwidth selection problem in our simulation studies .      in the literature of kernel density estimation ,",
    "various bandwidth selectors have been proposed , several typical examples of which have been alluded to in the introduction .",
    "when turning to the case with dependent observations , the bandwidth selection problem has been also drawing much attention , see e.g. , @xcite . among existing bandwidth selectors ,",
    "probably the most frequently employed ones are based on the cross - validation ideas . for cross - validation bandwidth selectors ,",
    "one tries to minimize the integrated squared error ( ise ) of the empirical estimator @xmath189 where @xmath284 note that on the right - hand side of the above equality , the last term @xmath285 is independent of @xmath194 and so the minimization of @xmath286 is equivalent to minimize @xmath287 it is shown that with i.i.d observations , an unbiased estimator of the above quantity , which is termed as least squares cross - validation ( lscv ) , is given as follows : @xmath288 where the leave - one - out density estimator @xmath289 is defined as @xmath290 when the observations are dependent , it is shown that cross - validation can produce much under - smoothed estimates , see e.g. , @xcite . observing this , @xcite proposed the modified least squares cross - validation ( mlscv ) , which is defined as follows @xmath291 where @xmath292 is set to @xmath64 or @xmath134 as suggested in @xcite and @xmath293 the underlying intuition of proposing mlscv is that when estimating the density of a fixed point , ignoring observations in the vicinity of this point may be help in reducing the influence of dependence among observations .",
    "however , when turning to the @xmath1 point of view , the above bandwidth selectors may not work well due to the use of the least squares criterion . alternatively , @xcite proposed the double kernel bandwidth selector that minimizes the following quantity @xmath294 where @xmath295 and @xmath296 are kernel density estimators based on the kernels @xmath11 and @xmath297 , respectively .",
    "some rigorous theoretical treatments on the effectiveness of the above bandwidth selector were made in @xcite .",
    "our purpose in simulation studies is to conduct empirical comparisons among the above bandwidth selectors in the dynamical system context instead of proposing new approaches .      in our experiments , observations @xmath298",

    "the criterion of comparing different selected bandwidths is the following absolute mean error ( ame ) : @xmath312 where @xmath313 are @xmath314 equispaced points in the interval @xmath315 $ ] and @xmath314 is set to @xmath316 .",
    "we also compare the selected bandwidth with the one that has the minimum absolute mean error which serves as a * _ baseline _ * method in our experiments .",

    "[ gauss_map_figure ] , we also plot the kernel density estimators for logistic map in example [ logistic_map ] and gauss map in example [ gauss_map ] with different bandwidths and their true density functions with different sample sizes .",
    "the sample size of each panel , in figs.[logistic_map_figure ] and [ gauss_map_figure ] , from up to bottom , is @xmath318 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 , respectively . in each panel",
    ", the densely dashed black curve represents the true density , the dotted blue curve is the estimated density function with the bandwidth selected by the baseline method while the solid red curve stands for the estimated density with the bandwidth selected by the double kernel method .",
    "all density functions in figs.[logistic_map_figure ] and [ gauss_map_figure ] are plotted with @xmath306 equispaced points in the interval @xmath321 .",

    "in fact , according to our experimental experience , we find that the bandwidth selector of the kernel density estimator for a dynamical system is usually ad - hoc .",
    "that is , for existing bandwidth selectors , there seems no a universal optimal one that can be applicable to all dynamical systems and outperforms the others .",
    "therefore , further exploration and insights on the bandwidth selection problem in the dynamical system context certainly deserve future study . on the other hand",
    ", we also notice that due to the presence of dependence among observations generated by dynamical systems , the sample size usually needs to be large enough to approximate the density function well .",
