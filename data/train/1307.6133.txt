    "in a composite model in which leptons and quarks are bound states of two fundamental , massless spin-@xmath0 preons , called @xmath3 and @xmath4 , interacting via color and hypercolor forces  @xcite , a new class of fermionic bound states , called hyperquarks , has recently been introduced in order to satisfy a special case of the t hooft anomaly matching conditions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to quarks , which carry zero hypercolor and open color , hyperquarks have zero color and open hypercolor .",
    "the matching of the anomalies on the preon and bound state levels that has been achieved by introducing hyperquarks gives an answer to the question why there are exactly three fermionic generations . at the same time it raises new questions , foremost whether there is any experimental evidence for hyperquarks .    because hyperquarks are subject to confining forces one would expect hyperquark bound states , such as hypermesons and hyperbaryons to exist in nature .",
    "the nonobservation of these hyperhadrons with present accelerators indicates that their masses are considerably larger than those of ordinary hadrons , and that hyperquarks are much heavier than quarks .",
    "hyperhadrons might have been produced in the early universe . however , because not even the lightest of these is observed today , the lightest hyperquark itself can not be stable . consequently , a new class of massive bosons which generate hyperquark decays must exist .    in this paper , we discuss the spectrum of composite spin 1 bosons that can be constructed in the preon model as well as their role in various weak decay processes .",
    "we assume that all massive composite bosons including the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the standard model , as well as those responsible for hyperquark decay , remain tightly bound at least up to @xmath7 gev ( grand unification scale ) .",
    "explicit preon degrees of freedom do not appear below this scale so that the corresponding interactions between preon bound states can be described by approximate _ effective _ gauge theories . in particular , for low energies @xmath8 gev ( fermi scale ) one recovers the standard model lagrangian with left - right asymmetric weak interactions , while for @xmath9 gev ( partial unification scale ) , it is suggested that an effective su(6 ) gauge theory unifies left - right symmetric extended weak interactions including the new gauge bosons generating hyperquark decay with the hypercolor interaction .",
    "we also address the issue of the mass scale , where hyperquarks appear .",
    "the momentum dependence of the different gauge couplings is used to predict the energy scale where they converge and a unified gauge theory with a single coupling occurs .",
    "this in turn enables us to put limits on the nonperturbative regime of the hypercolor force and the mass of the lightest hypermeson . in short ,",
    "the purpose of this work is to address the following questions :    * how are massive weak gauge bosons described in the preon model ? * which processes and gauge bosons are responsible for hyperquark instability ?",
    "* what is the effect of hyperquarks in various weak interaction processes ? * at what energy scale do hyperquarks and their composites appear ?",
    "important questions such as gauge boson and fermion mass generation are not discussed here .",
    "it may suffice to say that in the present model there are no fundamental higgs fields although there could be composite scalars such as hyperquark bound states .",
    "this is reminiscent of technicolor models and appears to be promising .",
    "however , closer inspection shows that hyperquarks are singlets under weak isospin .",
    "therefore , they and their scalar bound states do not have the same su(2)@xmath10u(1)@xmath11 group structure as the standard model fermions and higgs fields .",
    "thus , hyperquark bound state scalars can not give mass to any of the standard model gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "in this paper , we concentrate on the spectrum of vector bosons .",
    "we hope to come back to the issue of scalar particles and mass generation in the preon model elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : fermionicboundstates ] gives a short review of fermionic bound states in the preon model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : extendedweak ] , taking as straightforward a position as possible , we discuss an extension of the standard electroweak theory , making explicit the preon content of the massive electroweak gauge bosons including those responsible for hyperquark - quark transitions .",
    "a further generalization of the extended weak and the hypercolor interactions is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : partialunificationscheme ] . the resulting theory , which we call partial unification , represents a necessary step towards grand unification , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : grandunification ] .",
    "[ sec : runningcoupling ] provides numerical results for the running couplings and unification constraints from where mass ranges of the heavy bosons , the lightest neutrino , and the hyperquarks are obtained .",
    "the predicted hyperhadron masses are within reach of the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "[ sec : summary ] contains a summary and outlook .",
    "in the harari - shupe model  @xcite all quarks and leptons are built from just two spin-@xmath0 fermions ( preons ) . according to harari and seiberg  @xcite",
    "the two types of preons belong to the following representations of the underlying exact gauge group su(3)@xmath12 @xmath13 su(3)@xmath14 @xmath13 u(1)@xmath15 : t : ( 3,3)@xmath16 and v : ( 3,@xmath17)@xmath18 , where the first ( second ) argument is the dimension of the representation in hypercolor ( color ) space and the subscript denotes the electric charge @xmath19 .",
    "the fundamental lagrangian of the preon model  @xcite reads [ preonlagrangian ] l & = & |t ( + g_h _ h + g_c _ c + e _ q ) t + & + & |v ( + g_h _ h + g_c _ c ) v + & & - f_h f_h - f_c f_c - f_q f_q , with @xmath20 representing the three fundamental gauge fields of the theory with their respective coupling strengths @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . the last three terms in eq.([preonlagrangian ] ) represent the kinetic energies of the gauge fields , where the field strength tensors @xmath24 are as usual given in terms of the @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 are the dirac matrices and @xmath27 are generators of the corresponding gauge groups .",
    "although there are two degenerate types of preons ( t and v ) there is no global su(2 ) isospin symmetry on the preon level because the charged and neutral preon belong to different representations in color space . to be consistent with the parity assignment for the standard model fermions , the intrinsic parity @xmath28 of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 preons must be different  @xcite .",
    "the different parities of @xmath3 and @xmath4 preons provide a possible explanation for parity violation at low energies as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : partialunificationscheme ] .",
    ".the color @xmath29 , hypercolor @xmath30 , electric charge @xmath19 , preon number @xmath31 , @xmath32 number , and intrinsic parity @xmath28 of preons and antipreons ( see also  @xcite ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the standard model leaves many questions unanswered ; for example , why leptons and quarks share the same weak interaction , mediated by heavy vector bosons coupling differently to left- and right - handed quarks and leptons .",
    "this fact , among others , points to a deeper connection between leptons and quarks . in the preon model ,",
    "weak interactions are qualitatively understood as a residual force that is associated with the preon number of the bound state . on the other hand , a model which contains only the unbroken gauge interactions",
    "su(3)@xmath33su(3)@xmath34 u(1)@xmath15 between preons does not readily lend itself to a quantitative description of the left - right asymmetric weak interactions between preon bound states at low energies .",
    "furthermore , it does not provide a dynamical explanation for certain new phenomena predicted by the present theory , for example , the decay of hyperquarks into quarks .",
    "therefore , we have attempted to make some progress by considering approximate effective gauge theories on the level of preon bound states .",
    "in particular , we have investigated the bosonic sector of the preon model in some detail .",
    "we have shown that the introduction of hyperquarks in harari s theory requires new classes of effective gauge bosons , called @xmath35 and @xmath36 in order to describe weak transitions among hyperquarks and between hyperquarks and quarks .",
    "the presence of these additional gauge bosons leads to an extension of the standard su(2)@xmath37u(1)@xmath38 electroweak theory to a larger gauge group emerging at an energy @xmath39 gev . at this scale , 9 left - right symmetric weak bosons , 8 hypergluons , and 18 neutralons",
    "provide the 35 generators of an effective su(6)@xmath40 gauge group , refered to as partial unification group .",
    "this scheme predicts a weinberg angle @xmath41 at @xmath39 gev , which is twice its experimental value at @xmath42 gev .",
    "furthermore , it shows that the breaking of left - right su(2)@xmath37su(2)@xmath43 symmetry into the standard model symmetry su(2)@xmath37u(1)@xmath11 is closely connected with the production and decay of hyperquarks and thus to some extent explained in the present model .    at the grand unification scale @xmath44",
    "gev the spectrum of bosonic preon bound states is much larger .",
    "in addition to the usual gut bosons , which provide transitions between quarks and leptons as in proton decay processes , several new gauge bosons appear , the counting of which leads to the grand unification group su(9)@xmath45 .",
    "next to the 35 gauge bosons of su(6)@xmath40 , there are 8 gluons of su(3)@xmath14 , 18 colored bosons ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and their antiparticles ) , 18 hypercolored bosons ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and their antiparticles ) , and the photon @xmath52 of u(1)@xmath53 , altogether 80 generators of su(9)@xmath45 .",
    "the hyperquark mass scale has been found from the dimension of these unified gauge groups , the number of fermionic bound states , and the requirement that the coupling constants of the various effective gauge interactions are equal at the two unification scales .",
    "these constraints lead to a system of three equations with three unknows , allowing the determination of both unification scales @xmath54 gev and @xmath44 gev , and the average hyperquark mass scale @xmath55 gev . to obtain a mass constraint for the lightest hyperquark bound state , the hyperpion , we have extrapolated from the point @xmath56 to the point @xmath57 where @xmath58 and obtained @xmath59 gev , as the typical scale for hyperhadron masses , which is within reach of the lhc at cern .",
    "finally , from the unification constraints mentioned above , the majorana description of neutrinos is prefered . for dirac neutrinos",
    "the present theory leads to a proton lifetime which is too short , and furthermore to a hyperquark mass scale below the masses of w and z bosons , both results contradicting experimental facts .    in summary ,",
    "based on the introduction of hyperquarks as a new class of fermionic bound states we have depicted a scenario for the unification of forces that partly explains the left - right asymmetry of weak interactions at low energies and fills the large gap between the fermi scale and partial unification scale with a wide spectrum of hyperquark bound states .",
