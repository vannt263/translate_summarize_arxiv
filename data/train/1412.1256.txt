    "the current software employs the boxcar window function in the time - domain fft segments , which results in the sinc - squared spectral resolution function .",
    "this treatment causes subtle sidelobe associated with narrow and strong emission lines .",
    "polaris is a software spectrometer , which is flexible for applying other window functions , such as hamming , hanning , and blackman windows , to reduce sidelobe levels in the spectral resolution function .",
    "we choose the boxcar window for online processing because sidelobe mitigation with a relevant window function can be applied in post processing .",
    "observers can apply desired apodization function or spectral smoothing to reduce spectral sidelobes .",
    "the system marked sufficient linearity in total power measurements within 1% accuracy over the input power range of @xmath98 db .",
    "the total power measurement is used to estimate the receiver noise temperature and the system noise temperature by comparing powers in two or more circumstances where the feed horn points to the absorber at ambient temperature ( @xmath99 k ) , to the cold load ( @xmath100 k ) , and to the blank sky ( @xmath101 k ) .",
    "since the typical receiver noise of the z45 is @xmath102 k , the power range between the cold load , the blank sky and the ambient load will be @xmath103 ( 4.3 db ) and @xmath104 ( 6.9 db ) .",
    "thus , the dynamic range of @xmath60 db is sufficient for the system noise measurement , if we set the power level adequately .",
    "we note that the departure from linearity displayed in fig .",
    "[ aba : contlini ] could be due to saturation of the power meter , because the power meter we employed for this experiment has a maximum rated input power of @xmath105 dbm .",
    "therefore the linear range of polaris could be wider than presented here .",
    "the dynamic range of 33 db in line intensity is also enough for astronomical spectroscopy .",
    "the departure from the linear trend in high - power ends can be ascribed to inaccuracy of the signal generator , because the sensitivity profiles above @xmath106 dbm are very similar in both ` high - power ' and ` low - power ' .",
    "the underestimation in low - power ends , especially in the ` low - power ' attenuator setting , can be caused by uncertainty in baseline subtraction because the departure from the linear trend was significant where the line intensity is comparable to the standard deviation ( @xmath107 ) of the system noise .",
    "the performance of weak line detectability is verified with the sd of the spectrum at long integration time . as is shown in section [ sec : sens ] , the sensitivity is maintained for the timescale of 54000 s. the field - test observations of ccs molecular line toward tmc-1 also indicate that the system shows no significant departure in the linearity range down to @xmath108% .",
    "as shown in subsection [ sec : stablity ] , the bandpass shape is very smooth and stable , allowing us to apply sbc to reduce random errors in off - source scans efficiently .",
    "this indicates that the analog system ( baseband converters and analog - to - digital converter ) performs sufficiently stably and the digital system ( in software ) works perfectly . the sav ( see fig .",
    "[ savplot ] ) indicates a very good flatness in the bandpass - corrected spectrum",
    ". the systematic error of bandpass shape after sbc application will be less than @xmath109 at the maximum channel separation of 11585 ch for broad line detection , even if we employ a single bandpass table for 15-hour observations .",
    "the mean values of the bandpass - corrected spectra were decreasing while the increasing total power ( see fig .",
    "[ aba : tavplot ] ) .",
    "we consider that this is ascribed to increase of power in band edges caused by bandpass distortion .",
    "because the gain table , @xmath110 , is derived from bit distribution that includes power in band edges , increase of power in band edges makes @xmath110 greater and lets the mean power without band edges decreased after gain calibration .",
    "we can also see convex and concave distortion at the beginning and ending periods , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ bpvar ] .",
    "this behavior supports the explanation above .    the stability in bandpass shape is also confirmed by the sensitivity shown in subsection [ sec : sens ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : sd ] , the sd of bandpass - corrected spectra follows the @xmath86 law for the integration time shorter than 18000 s. the excess of sd at the longest integration time can be caused by the bandpass error , related with variation in total power as discussed in the last paragraph , because the distortion of bandpass shape after sbc is estimated to @xmath111 and non - negligible for integration longer than 18000 s. note that the sd value at the longest integration time is still smaller than the expectation of @xmath112 .",
    "this is probably because the effective bandwidth is narrower than 4 mhz due to the antialias filter ( see fig .",
    "[ savplot ] ) and thus the sampling frequency of 8 mhz is slightly higher than the nyquist rate .",
    "the cross - correlation capability is confirmed by the engineering test with the artificial source ( subsection [ sec : corr ] ) and the field test ( subsection [ sec : fieldtest ] ) . with",
    "the injection of the linearly polarized artificial monochromatic wave into a dual circular feed , we got @xmath89 % of correlation .",
    "the departure from @xmath113 % could be due to temperature fluctuation of the system that yields relative phase fluctuation between lhcp and rhcp .",
    "the measured cross power spectra of the sio maser in the observation toward r leo ( see fig .",
    "[ rleo ] ) demonstrates the potential of this instrument to perform high precision polarimetric observations . in both @xmath91 and @xmath92 transitions , the velocity components within @xmath114 km",
    "s@xmath13 shows highly polarized emission with a significant amplitude in cross power spectra , small phase dispersion , and difference between @xmath115 and @xmath116 spectra . the large gap in phase between velocity components of @xmath117 km s@xmath13 and @xmath118 km s@xmath13 in @xmath91 suggests that the electric - vector position angles are significantly different between these two components .",
    "the blueshifted components in @xmath119 km s@xmath13 show much weaker polarization than the redshifted components .",
    "the ccs molecular emission is expected to be unpolarized , because it is a thermal emission in the dark cloud . as was expected , we got neither significant detection in cross power spectrum nor significant difference between @xmath115 and @xmath116 spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ ccsplot ] ) .",
    "the phases of the cross power spectra randomly distributed in @xmath120 $ ] , suggesting non - detection .",
    "note that the amplitude of cross power spectrum is biased from 0 , because it is always positive and follows the rayleigh distribution when the expectation of cross power spectrum is 0 .",
    "the line peak intensity of @xmath121 k with 1.95-khz resolution is slightly higher than the results of @xmath122 k with 37-khz resolution using the acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) on the nobeyama 45-m radio telescope @xcite .",
    "if we apply channel - averaging to set the same spectral resolution of 37 khz , the spectrum by polaris results in @xmath123 k and close to the aos measurement .",
    "the line profile from the mapping observation of tmc-1 @xcite showed a somewhat different profile , depending on the position of the molecular cloud . because of the difference of beam size and pointing position , it is difficult to evaluate the difference of line profiles .",
    "the widths of both line edges are only @xmath101 hz .",
    "the sharpness of the line profile was @xmath124 mk hz@xmath13 that yields stokes @xmath125 mk at both line edges if we assume the zeeman shift of 64 hz for @xmath126 g . to detect the stokes @xmath3 with the signal - to - noise ratio of 5 under the condition of @xmath127 k , on - source integration time of @xmath128 s is required .",
    "we have developed a software - based polarization spectrometer , polaris , using commercially available devices of the k5/vssp32 sampler and the linux computer , at the cost of jpy 500,000 and jpy 70,000 , respectively . using the gpu for fft and cross - correlation processes , spectroscopy for 4-if 4- or 8-mhz bandwidth with a 61-hz spectral resolution",
    "can be carried out in real time .    through the engineering tests ,",
    "we have verified the basic performance of polaris .",
    "the spectral resolution function was consistent with the theoretical prediction of a sinc - squared profile with a fwhm of @xmath129 hz .",
    "the linearity between input signal power and measured power has been confirmed within 1% accuracy for the range of @xmath60 db and 33 db for continuum total power and emission line , respectively .",
    "the bandpass shape was flat and stable enough to apply sbc with 125-khz frequency width .",
    "no significant bandpass variation exceeding @xmath130 with respect to the system noise was found for the time span of 15 hours .",
    "the standard deviation of the spectrum was 12.5% as small as the expectation of @xmath112 at 54000-s integration and follows the @xmath86 law between 1 s and 54000 s. the cross power spectra were verified by injection of a linearly polarized artificial signal into a dual circular feed and cross - correlation of them .",
    "the field test observations were carried out toward the strongly polarized maser source , r leo , and unpolarized ccs emission of tmc-1 .",
    "we verified the performance of the power spectra that will yield full stokes spectra crucial to our primary aim of the zeeman effect measurements .",
    "all the software code is open in the github repository and anyone can download and use it or review the signal processing inside .",
    "the development of polaris is supported by the fy2012 joint development research program of the national astronomical observatory of japan , and by a grant - in - aid for scientific research of japan ( 24244017 ) .",
