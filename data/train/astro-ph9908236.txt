    "let us assume a simple power law energy distribution , @xmath64 , so that the results of this section can be compared with those in which the electron momenta are isotropically distributed ( next section ) .",
    "it should be born in mind , however , that there are no known simple mechanisms providing a power law energy distribution in accelerated electron beams ( fermi mechanisms in general work with isotropic electrons momenta ) .    the aic emissivity is simply obtained by replacing @xmath65 with @xmath66 in eq.(22 ) .    it can be noticed that the emitted power vanishes when @xmath67 goes to infinity ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "electrons of increasing energy are required to scatter the photons to a given energy @xmath9 at larger angles from the electron beam , up to a maximum angular distance for which @xmath69 .",
    "therefore photons of energy @xmath9 are scattered in the line of sight only if the angular distance of the electron beam is sufficiently small . since the scattering problem is symmetric with respect to the z  axis , it is simpler to study the spatial distribution of the scattered radiation by assuming that the electron beam lies on the ( y  z ) plane . from eq.(13 ) , with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , one finds that the limiting condition @xmath72 is obtained at two extremes in @xmath73 ( fig.2 ) :    @xmath74 \\pm \\ { ( 1-(e_3 ^ 0)^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\cdot ( 1-(1-{{\\epsilon_0}\\over{\\epsilon_1}}(1-e_3 ^ 0))^2 ) \\}^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , by releasing the condition @xmath75 , one obtains the extremes in @xmath76 by imposing the condition @xmath77 .",

    "the angle of the electron velocity at which this happens is derived from eq.(24 ) by setting @xmath79 :    @xmath80    for @xmath81 the scattered directions on the ( y  z ) plane are comprised in the interval @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while for @xmath84 the scattered directions are bounded by @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( fig.2 ) .    in the thomson limit eq.(22 ) becomes :    @xmath89    where @xmath67 and @xmath90 are given by eq.(14 ) with @xmath37 replaced by the assumed electron beam coordinates @xmath39 and with @xmath8 replaced by @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore it can be readily shown that in the thomson approximation the emitted pattern has the same boundaries of the klein ",

    "an example of the emitted power as a function of the scattering angle , both in the thomson approximation and in the klein ",
    "nishina case , is represented in fig.3 for two different values of the electron spectral index .",
    "relatively more power is channeled at larger scattering angles with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "the broadening in the emitted power distribution in the case of low values of @xmath15 is due to the contribution of the high energy electrons that emit along relatively large values of @xmath91 .    due to the compton",
    "recoil the energies of the electrons that are required to scatter incoming photons ( @xmath4 ) up to an energy @xmath9 in the klein ",

    "nishina regime is more depressed in the case of a steeper energy distribution of the electrons ( as it is @xmath92 in fig.3 ) .",
    "the emitted power per unit frequency and solid angle as a function of the emitted energy is represented in fig.4 for different scattering angles both in the thomson approximation and in the klein ",
    "nishina case .",
    "the very sharp cut - off in the emitted spectrum is simply due to the kinematics of the scattering and only weakly depends on the electron differential spectrum .",
    "such feature represents the portion of the emitted spectrum contributed by the electrons with @xmath54 approaching to unity and with the emitted photons moving along the boundaries of the scattered cones .",
    "in fig.4 it is seen that the difference between the thomson approximation and the klein ",
    "nishina scattering becomes larger at small scattering angles ( with respect to the direction of the electron beam ) and increases with the energy of the scattered photons .",
    "actually , for each scattering configuration this difference follows a quite complicated trend being smaller both at low and at high emitted energies and larger at intermediate energies .",
    "the trend is due to the difference between the thomson and the kn cross sections but , because of the compton recoil , it is also sensitive to the electron energy distribution ( see brunetti 1998 for further details ) .    a relevant example is the thomson spectrum in the direction of the electron beam ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) . in this case from eq.(26 ) the compton emissivity is :    @xmath95    in the ultra ",

    "the minimum velocity of the electrons is obtained by minimizing eq.(13 ) with respect to the electron directions ( @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "given that the distribution of the scattering electrons is isotropic , it is equivalent to describe the emitted spectrum with reference to any plane containing the incoming photon momenta ( the z  axis ) . for simplicity of notation",
    "we study the scattering properties on the ( y  z ) plane , so that @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and the electrons having the lowest energy to make the scattering are those moving on the ( y  z ) plane i.e. with @xmath114 ( i.e. @xmath115 ) .",

    "we assume that the far ir  optical spectrum of a typical quasar hidden in a powerful radio galaxy is represented by four power laws ( @xmath163 ) with @xmath158 = 0.2 , 0.9 , 1.7 , and 0.6 respectively in the intervals 10050 , 506 , 60.65 , and 0.650.35 ( as in brunetti et al.1997 ) .",

    "we further assume that the relativistic electrons are injected in the radio volume , approximated with a prolate ellipsoid of @xmath165 kpc semiaxis , with an energy differential spectrum @xmath166 ( the calculated aic fluxes are typically contributed by electrons by @xmath167 ) and that the magnetic fields , of average constant intensity @xmath138 , and particles momenta are randomly distributed on a sufficiently small scale",

    "this is crucial in order to compare the predictions with detailed spatially resolved x  ray spectroscopy .",
    "deep radio observations of the hot spot regions of the radio galaxy cyg a have suggested the possibility of a low energy cut off , or a turn over in the particle distribution ( carilli et al .",

    "the aic scattering with the nuclear photons dominates the radiative losses at relative small distance from the nucleus .",
    "this distance depends on the quasar luminosity and on the magnetic field strength in the lobes ( fig.13 ) .    due to the decrease of the break energy with decreasing distance from the nucleus ,",
    "the innermost regions of the radio volume contribute less to the radiation spectrum of the radio galaxies at high frequencies .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy in the x  ray domain can provide important information about @xmath181 , especially in the innermost regions of the radio galaxies .",

    "the complex spectral index behaviour is due to the interplay of the ir and uv bumps with the time / spatially evolved particle energy distribution .",
    "the x  ray spectral index of the innermost regions of the radio galaxies is significantly steeper than those pertaining to the extended regions and to the radio synchrotron spectral index of the high brightness lobes .",

    "ray spectral index ( 0.1  1 kev ) is expected to be considerably harder than the synchrotron spectral index ( = 0.75 ) . as a consequence",
    "detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy provided by chandra may yield unprecedented information about the energy distribution of the relativistic particles in the low energy portion of the spectrum .    if the radio galaxy is inclined with respect to the plane of the sky",
    "the nuclear photons in the far lobe are on average scattered toward the observer at angles larger than those in the near lobe .",
    "since in the case of aic scattering the typical @xmath0 of the scattering electrons depends on the scattering angle ( eq.34 ) , one finds that in the far lobe the nuclear photons are scattered at a given @xmath9 by less energetic electrons than in the near lobe . as a consequence ,",
    "depending on the inclination of the radio galaxy on the sky plane , all the spectral features in fig.14 would appear shifted at lower energies in the case of the near lobe and at larger energies in the case of the far lobe .",
    "typically this results in a spectrum of the far lobe significantly harder than that of the near lobe .    in the case of distant ( or faint ) radio galaxies",

    "the total emitted power is obtained by integrating the emissivity over the emitting volume . the contribution from the ic scattering of the cmb photons should be taken into account in the case of high redshift and/or very extended radio galaxies .",
    "the radio volume can be modelled in detail when one deals with a specific radio galaxy . in figs.14 and 15 the calculated aic spectral index and emitted power ( in arbitrary units ) from powerful radio galaxies",
