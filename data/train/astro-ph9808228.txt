    "accordingly , figure 2 compares the 1.4  ghz and h@xmath5  luminosity functions and the corresponding distributions of the inferred star formation rate densities , both expressed on a common @xmath35 scale to facilitate comparison .    over the range where the h@xmath5  luminosity function is well determined ( @xmath36 w or @xmath37 m@xmath22 yr@xmath3 ) the two luminosity functions cross , with the h@xmath5  distribution rising somewhat more steeply to lower luminosities and dropping slightly below the 1.4  ghz function at the highest observed point . at faint luminosities",
    "the extrapolation of the h@xmath5  luminosity function rises above the 1.4  ghz function , but the difference never exceeds a factor of 5 even at the faintest luminosities . the star formation rate density inferred from h@xmath5  is approximately twice the density inferred from 1.4  ghz observations , for values of sfr below about @xmath38 m@xmath22 yr@xmath3 .    the excess of the 1.4  ghz value of sfr relative to the h@xmath5  value therefore arises at high values of sfr .",
    "this is clear from figure 2 , which shows that the h@xmath5   luminosity function is @xmath39 dex@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 at @xmath40 m@xmath22 yr@xmath3 while at the same @xmath41 , the 1.4  ghz luminosity function is a factor of 25 greater .",

    "the 1.4  ghz results are consistent with this trend .",
    "it should be noted that dust extinction leads to uncertainty in estimates of the star formation rate from uv and optical indicators .",
    "for example , pettini _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1997 , their fig 7 ) suggest that an upward revision of a factor of approximately 2 - 6 should be applied to uncorrected estimates of star formation rates based on ultraviolet observations .",

    "et al .  _",
    "( 1998 , their figure 8) have estimated the evolution of the global star formation rate using sub - mm observations which , like radio observations , should be unaffected by extinction .",
    "their estimates agree , to within a factor of two over the range @xmath1 , with those derived here .",
    "in addition to the consistency with sub - mm observations noted above , there is close agreement between the evolution of the sfr density derived from 1.4  ghz data , and from far - infrared observations of the _ hubble deep field _ by the infrared space observatory ( rowan - robinson _",
    "et al .  _",
    "this result could have been anticipated , in view of the strong correlation between 1.4  ghz and far - infrared luminosities in local star - forming galaxies , and the viability of theories of the correlation which relate both luminosities to the number of massive stars in the galaxies ( e.g. condon 1992 ) .",
    "estimates of the sfr density inferred from far - uv or h@xmath5  data ( uncorrected for extinction ) appear to be systematically lower , by a factor of order @xmath52 .",
    "the discrepancy could be a consequence of a moderate amount of optical / far uv extinction , an interpretation that finds some support in studies of nearby galaxies which have revealed evidence of widespread extinction , including high attenuation in some objects ( e.g. , young , kleinmann & allen 1988 ; see also pettini _ et al .",
    "however , it should also be noted that the ratio of the instantaneous luminosity of various sfr indicators to the short - term average of the sfr itself is a complex function of time ( e.g. , h@xmath5  is weighted strongly to the most massive stars lifetimes , while 1.4 ghz radiation is weighted to the more abundant stars lying just above the lower mass limit for supernovae ) .",
    "it is likely that factors other than extinction will also prove to be relevant in explaining the discrepancy between various sfr indicators .",
    "further studies of the extinction in galaxies having high values of @xmath41 and low values of @xmath53 could help resolve this question .",
    "of particular interest are galaxies having @xmath54 m@xmath55 yr@xmath3 . in such galaxies ,",
    "the ` shortfall ' in h@xmath5  emission is particularly large , and this might lead to obvious characteristic differences between the morphology in 1.4  ghz and h@xmath5  images .    in condon s ( 1984b ) model the evolution of the star - forming galaxy luminosity function is constrained almost exclusively by the fit to sub - mjy 1.4  ghz source counts .",
    "this is not a particularly tight constraint , and as more redshifts become available for sub - mjy star - forming galaxies the evolution will become better defined . already , the studies of benn _ et al .  _",

    "( 1993 ) and hopkins ( 1998 ) suggest that consistency arises between the local 1.4  ghz luminosity function of star - forming galaxies , the sub - mjy source counts and the available @xmath56 distributions if there is luminosity evolution according to @xmath57 . this picture is consistent with results obtained at other wavelengths ( e.g. hacking , condon & houck 1987 ) .",
    "since the 1.4  ghz data suggest that approximately 50% of star formation at @xmath58 takes place in star forming galaxies with @xmath59 w hz@xmath3 , and since such galaxies are not difficult to detect at radio frequencies ( @xmath60jy ) , optical spectroscopy of complete samples of sub - mjy 1.4  ghz sources could make an important contribution to our understanding of cosmic star formation history in the era @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that studies of the cosmic evolution of _ powerful _ radio galaxies ( i.e. , agn - powered objects with @xmath61 w hz@xmath3 ) suggest that the population undergoes pure luminosity evolution according to @xmath27 out to @xmath62 , with a luminosity dependent redshift cut - off at higher @xmath63 ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",
    "as emphasised by dunlop ( 1998 ) , these studies provide a robust determination of the evolution of the 1.4  ghz luminosity density , despite remaining uncertainties in the high-@xmath63 evolution of the luminosity function itself .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the luminosity evolution of the agn - powered population appears to be quite similar that of the star - forming population ( danese _ et al .  _",
    "1987 ; dunlop 1998 ) .",
    "dunlop ( 1998 ) advances the suggestion that the star formation rate and the agn ( black hole ) fueling rate might both be related to the global rate of gravitational accretion / condensation .    the use of 1.4 ghz radiation to determine star formation rates offers some advantages over alternative methods .",
    "for example , 1.4  ghz radiation does not usually suffer absorption , and the local 1.4  ghz luminosity function of star - forming galaxies is well determined over a wide luminosity range .",
    "compared with mm - wave and far - infrared ( fir ) indicators , which share these advantages over optical and uv indicators , deep 1.4 ghz observations have superior sensitivity , and offer astrometric precision sufficient to make direct optical identifications of even the faintest sources .",
    "the main weakness is the tenuous linkage between 1.4  ghz radiation and the astrophysics of star formation .",
