    "the study of apollonian circle packings is an elegant geometric subject that generates deep questions in the theory of hyperbolic coxeter groups , lie theory , and analytic number theory , and many interesting problems about these packings can be effectively solved with state - of - the - art techniques from these fields .",

    "the case of apollonian equilateral triangles is a similar but less well - studied topic , and the goal of the project was to answer natural questions about this case with advanced techniques in group theory and number theory .",
    "formally , an apollonian circle packing is a fractal generated from triples of mutually tangent circles . in such a packing , for any four mutually tangent circles , their curvatures , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , satisfy descartes s equation , @xmath7 .",
    "note that for fixed @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , exactly two values of @xmath3 satisfy the equation , generating two possible configurations , as illustrated in figure  [ apolloniancase ] .",
    "given the configuration in figure  [ d ] , additional circles can be inscribed in each lune successively , a process illustrated in figure  [ apollonianoperation ] .",
    "in addition , it is clear that given four mutually tangent circles with curvatures @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the curvature of the new circle inscribed in the lune bounded by the circles with curvatures @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 is @xmath8 , which is easily derived from descartes s equation .",
    "define an apollonian quadruple be a quadruple of nonnegative integers satisfying descartes s equation .",
    "then the inscribing operation described above can be expressed as the transformation @xmath9 .",
    "now , consider the matrices @xmath10 it is clear that for an apollonian quadruple @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 , and analogous relations hold for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "in the apollonian triangle case , as in the apollonian circle case , there exist four matrices corresponding to reflection operations ( instead of inscribing operations ) , as illustrated in figure  [ operation ] , with which a triangle group can be defined . because of the great similarities between this case and the apollonian case , we are motivated to verify whether many of the properties in the apollonian case also hold for the triangle case , and where they do not , to determine whether the conclusions can be modified .",
