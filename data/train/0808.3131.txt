    "the lhc will eventually operate at 7 times the energy and 100 times the luminosity of the fermilab tevatron and will search for the mechanism of particle mass generation , supersymmetry which introduces a partner for each known particle , stabilizes the higgs mass and provides a candidate for the dark matter making up most of the universe , extra dimensions and other exciting new physics possibilities . the lhc will start taking physics data in 2008 with an expected integrated luminosity of less than 100 @xmath1 at a 10 tev center of mass energy followed by 14 tev running in 2009 that is expected to climb to the design annual integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath2 over the following years . to prepare for the initial startup period ,",

    "the atlas and cms experiments are general purpose pp detectors .",
    "atlas uses an inner superconducting solenoid containing silicon tracking and a transition radiation tracker and large superconducting air - core toroids interspersed with muon chambers surrounding liquid argon and iron - scintillator calorimetry .",
    "the cms experiment consists of a large diameter superconducting solenoid containing an all - silicon tracker , a @xmath3 electromagnetic calorimeter and a brass - scintillator hadron calorimeter , with a return yoke and muon chambers outside .",
    "the production of bb pairs at the lhc will be peaked in the forward direction , therefore lhcb is designed as a single - arm spectrometer covering 10 - 300 mrad in polar angle .",
    "the lhcb experiment is a single - arm spectrometer consisting of a vertex locator and main tracker , ring imaging cherenkov counters , an electromagnetic calorimeter , a hadron calorimeter and a muon detector .",
    "the alice experiment is designed for heavy ion collisions and consists of a silicon inner tracking system , a cylindrical time - projection chamber , a single - arm electromagnetic calorimeter , a time - of - flight detector , a transition radiation detector , a single - arm ring imaging cherenkov counter and a forward muon arm .",
    "after the lhc startup and well before the design instantaneous luminosity of @xmath4 is achieved , there are several physics channels with the potential for discovery .",
    "new physics producing resonances could include a new @xmath5 , _",
    "e.g. _ any new heavy gauge boson or from models with compact extra dimensions . spectacular multi - jet , multi - lepton and missing energy signatures",
    "would also be produced by susy , with production of  100 events per day at luminosities of @xmath6 for squark and gluino masses of   1 tev .",
    "almost all of the allowed higgs mass range will be explored by atlas and cms with 10 @xmath7 , and with 30 @xmath7 is covered to more than 7 @xmath8 over the whole range .",
    "the lhcb experiment will use the large sample of b - hadrons produced at the lhc to make precision studies of cp asymmetries and rare decays of b - mesons .",
    "the alice experiment will search for new physics in strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities where quark - gluon plasma is expected .",
    "the new physics discoveries of the lhc will depend on the calibration and alignment of the detectors , the validation of qcd and other standard model ( sm ) monte carlos ( mc ) and calculations and the overall understanding of the lhc detector and machine environment . a primary goal of the initial running will be to establish these items .",
    "this paper examines this process for the alice , atlas , cms and lhcb experiments and looks a the measurements that can be anticipated from data sets taken with integrated luminosities of 1 , 10 and 100 @xmath0 .",
    "the expected profile for the phases of lhc operation from startup to design luminosity , assuming @xmath9 seconds of pp operation per year is found in table [ tab : lumibuild ] . since the focus of this article is the initial startup , a breakdown of the various steps taken during the first phase of lhc operation , `` phase a ''",
    "is shown in table [ tab : lumistart ] .",
    "it is expected to take at minimum about 30 days of beam time to establish collisions followed by about one week for each of the steps shown .",
    "the luminosities shown should be scaled by 0.71 at 10 tev with respect to 14 tev due to the increased beam emittance at the lower energy . to exploit the early part of the lhc startup",
    ", the experiment collaborations are examining what can be done by with a small integrated luminosity .",
    "table [ tab : onepb ] shows the expected yield of events from an integrated luminosity of 1 @xmath0 at a center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "the yields should be about 5% lower for minimum bias events and a third lower for w and z production at the expected initial collision energy of 10 tev@xcite .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     top events are central and back to back so they can be observed quickly even with limited detector performance and analysis machinery . using cuts such as 3 jets with @xmath10 gev , 1 jet with @xmath11 gev , an isolated lepton with @xmath11 gev , and missing energy , @xmath12 gev can isolate a viable signal of @xmath13 events without a b - tag using an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath14@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : top ] shows the simulated invariant mass distribution of the three jets with the highest @xmath15 for various top signals and w + jets from an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath14 in the atlas detector@xcite .",
    "this should enable a 20% measurement of @xmath16 , and a measurement of @xmath17 to @xmath18 gev .",
    "this will help to constrain the theory and mc generators using such observables as the @xmath19 spectra .",
    "this early lhc data can also be used to constrain the parton distribution functions using the angular distributions of @xmath20 events . since @xmath21",
    ", w production over @xmath22 at the lhc involves @xmath23 , which is the region dominated by @xmath24 .",
    "the pdf uncertainties in this region are in the 4 - 8 % range",
    ". therefore early measurements of @xmath25 angular distributions at the lhc can provide discrimination between different pdfs if the experimental precision is @xmath26 .",
    "the systematics of these events ( _ e.g. _ @xmath25 acceptance vs.@xmath27 ) should be controllable to a few percent with @xmath28 events ( @xmath29 events expected in 100 @xmath1)@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that with 100 @xmath14 the atlas and cms experiments are exploring new territory .",
    "figure  [ fig : jetxsec ] shows the calculated jet cross sections in @xmath30 for the tevatron and lhc experiments with 3 different pdfs@xcite .",
    "a line indicates where 10 events are expected for an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath14 .",
    "the dijet cross sections can be examined for resonances .",
    "strongly produced resonances can be seen with a convincing signal for an excited quark at a mass of up to 2 tev with 100 @xmath14 of data .",
    "figure  [ fig : dijetres ] shows the cms simulation of dijet resonances reconstructed using corrected jets , coming from q * signals of mass 0.7 and 2 tev .",
    "the dijet ratio can be optimized for a contact interaction search by concentrating on the barrel region since the qcd cross section rises dramatically with the @xmath31 cut due to the t - channel pole @xcite .",
    "cms has shown that the sensitivity to a contact interaction signal is enhanced by this with the value of a discoverable @xmath32 increasing to 7 tev .",
    "figure  [ fig : dijetres ] shows the cms simulation of the dijet ratio for corrected jets expected from qcd compared to qcd + contact interaction signals with a scale @xmath32 = 5 tev and 10 tev .",
    "new physics such as a narrow resonance decaying into @xmath33 should be discoverable up to a mass of 1 tev .",
    "the signal is a narrow mass peak on top of a small drell - yan background .",
    "figure  [ fig : resonances ] shows the number of dilepton events produced in atlas by a resonance at 1 , 1.5 and 2 tev from an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath14 .",
    "further understanding of the source of the resonance , ( _ e.g. _ a @xmath5 or a graviton ) involves use of the angular distribution and a much larger data sample ( 100 @xmath2 ) .",
    "if present , susy should produce a large cross section for @xmath34 and @xmath35 production .",
    "these events would have spectacular signatures with many jets , leptons and missing @xmath30 .",
    "hints of susy production would begin to manifest themselves up to @xmath36 1 tev for an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath14 as shown in figure  [ fig : susy ] .",
    "however , a luminosity of @xmath37 @xmath38 is needed to properly understand the backgrounds@xcite .",
    "the lhcb detector will be able to record @xmath39 events in @xmath40 hours at a luminosity of @xmath41 with its interaction trigger .",
    "this would provide a first look at minimum bias events in 10 tev ( and later 14 tev ) collisions .",
    "the lhcb collaboration will measure the ratios of charged track multiplicities ( @xmath42 ) vs. @xmath43 .",
    "they will perform reconstruction and production studies of @xmath44 and other particles .",
    "these measurements will provide valuable input to the theoretical calculations and monte carlo generators that are essential to understanding the physics in this new kinematic regime .",
    "as an example , lhcb should have a sample of @xmath37 1 m @xmath45 events in 1 @xmath14 of data .",
    "these will be used to measure the fraction of @xmath46 from b decays or prompt production vs. @xmath19 , observe the first exclusive @xmath47 peaks and measure the @xmath48 production cross section .",
    "figure  [ fig : lhcb ] shows the extraction of the @xmath46 peak from a full simulation of 12.8 m minimum bias events in lhcb .",
    "this shows that even with a small amount of integrated luminosity , a significant peak can be extracted .",
    "one important signal for lhcb is @xmath49 .",
    "the efficiency for these events of 10% is large so the principal experimental issue is background rejection .",
    "the largest background is @xmath50 with the specific background of @xmath51 the most dominant .",
    "lhcb will exploit its muon identification , vertexing and mass resolution of 18 @xmath52 to extract a signal that is anticipated to exceed the combined tevatron experiment statistics after an integrated luminosity of 50 @xmath14@xcite .",
    "the first physics with alice will use pp collisions . this will provide important  reference \" data for the heavy ion program to follow .",
    "alice has extensive particle i d capabilities that will provide measurements for tuning minimum bias monte carlos and jet fragmentation models .",
    "alice can separate @xmath53 , k and p between 100 mev and 50 gev .",
    "the transition radiation detector can distinguish electrons above 1 gev and muons above 5 gev .",
    "weak decays and resonances can be identified between 0.5 to above 10 gev and @xmath54s can be detected between 1 and 80 gev@xcite .",
    "this provides a unique capability for alice to measure multiplicity distributions , baryon transport and the charm cross section that is a major input to pp qcd calculations .",
    "the measurement of charged multiplicity will be extended a factor of 7 in @xmath55 .",
    "figure  [ fig : alice ] shows the extrapolation of existing charged multiplicity measurements to the lhc .",
    "this will extend the existing energy dependence measurements and provide a new look at the particle fluctuations in pp collisions .",
    "measurements of the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry in alice should be able to distinguish between baryon number transport models , such as those based on quark exchange vs. string junction exchange .",
    "there is a large rapidity gap at the lhc ( @xmath56 units ) measurable in alice .",
    "the predicted baryon - antibaryon asymmetry for string junction exchange is 3 - 7% and it is predicted to be multiplicity dependent .",
    "alice has estimated the contributions to the systematic error in the asymmetry to be less than 1% from uncertainties in the cross section , the detector material budget and beam gas events@xcite .",
    "the statistical error is @xmath57 for @xmath58 pp events , which could be taken in one day .",
    "this measurement could also be extended to @xmath59 where the asymmetry is larger .",
    "the early physics data at the lhc will be used by alice , atlas , cms and lhcb experiments to lay the groundwork for understanding the physics of the new energy frontier . as such , samples from integrated luminosities of 1 , 10 , and 100",
