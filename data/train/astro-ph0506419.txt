    "one of the interesting results from _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey @xcite was the discovery of seven objects that appear to be nearby , thermally - emitting neutron stars that have little if any magnetospheric emission ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these objects , known most commonly as `` isolated neutron stars , '' are distinguished by their long periods ( @xmath5  s , when measured ) , largely thermal spectra with cool temperatures ( @xmath6  ev ) , faint optical counterparts ( when detected ) , and lack of radio emission .",
    "it is not yet clear what sets the isolated neutron stars apart from the nearby , relatively young rotation - powered pulsars that also have cool thermal emission  sources like psr  b0656 + 14 and psr  b1055@xmath052 which tend to have short ( @xmath7  s ) spin periods , @xmath8-g magnetic fields , non - thermal ( i.e.  power - law ) components in their x - ray spectra , and radio pulsations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the isolated neutron stars are known to have longer periods , but their spin - down rates ( and hence magnetic fields ) are unknown , largely because it has not yet been possible to determine a reliable , coherent timing solution ( @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite ) .    in this _",

    "we used the corrections supplied in @xcite .",
    "our goal was to use times - of - arrival ( toas ) to infer a phase - coherent timing solution involving the spin period and its derivative , where each cycle of the source was counted . to measure toas we needed an initial reference period , something which we determined using a @xmath16 test ( rayleigh statistic ; * ? ? ? * ) on the combined 2004 january acis and 2004 february hrc data .",
    "we find @xmath17  s ( here and below , numbers in parentheses indicate twice the formal 1-@xmath18 uncertainties in the last digit unless otherwise indicated ) , which is consistent with our earlier value ( ) but much more accurate because we could coherently connect observations over a much longer ( 52  day ) time span .",
    "using this period , we constructed binned light curves ( with 16 phase bins ) and determined the toas by fitting a sinusoid ( appropriate for the sinusoidal pulsations of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 ; @xcite ) ; the uncertainties were calculated from the uncertainties in the phases of the fitted sinusoids ( we verified that we obtain consistent results if we change the binning or measure toas using cross - correlation instead ) . here , the toa is defined as the time of maximum light closest to the middle of the observation , a choice which minimizes co - variance with small changes in period .",

    "we fit these cycle counts to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cycle count plus phase at reference time @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the spin - frequency , @xmath23 is its derivative , @xmath24 is the second derivative .",
    "we then iterated , using the improved solution to determine the cycle count for the next observation , etc .",
    "we started with @xmath25 , but left @xmath26 free once that significantly improved the fit ; @xmath27 was not required ( cf . ,   [ sec : noise ] below ) .",
    "the final ephemeris listed in table  [ tab : ephem ] has small , @xmath28  cycle , residuals , and fits the _ chandra _  data well : @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 degrees of freedom ) . to test the uniqueness of our ephemeris , we tried changing the cycle counts ( adding or subtracting one or more cycles ) at the least unambiguous points , but found that the resulting solutions were very poor ( e.g. , altering the cycles between the 2001 acis and 2000 hrc observations gave @xmath31 ) .    to improve and extend the ephemeris , we added the _ xmm _  and _ rosat_data into the solution ( see table  [ tab : ephem ] ) .",
    "as for the _ chandra _  data alone , the cycle counts are unambiguous and , as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : resid ] , the residuals remain below @xmath32  cycles , lending additional credence to our results . for verification",
    ", we also examined the fit using just the _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  data , which avoids the large gaps between the _ rosat _  observations .",
    "we found the same cycle counts , but a statistically significant difference in the inferred parameters [ @xmath33  hz and @xmath34 , while the fit to all data gave @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    while we are confident in our fit in general ,",
    "the above discrepancy is puzzling .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath37 values for the fits including the _ xmm _  data are poor , with @xmath38 for _ chandra_@xmath39_xmm_(@xmath40 ; @xmath41  s ) and @xmath42 for all of the data ( @xmath43 ; @xmath44  s ) , while the solution for _ chandra_@xmath39_rosat _ , although somewhat ambiguous , is tolerable ( @xmath45 ) and similar to the _ chandra_-only solution .",
    "the @xmath46 values for the full fits are dominated by the contribution of the _ xmm _  data , which have very small formal uncertainties ( but are not always entirely consistent from one instrument to another for the same observation ; see tab .  [",

    "there could be several reasons for the relatively poor fit of the timing solutions to our full set of arrival times .",
    "first , rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  may show some rotational instabilities or `` timing noise , '' as seen in radio pulsars .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of the long - term timing noise by fitting the phase residuals with a third - order ( @xmath65 ) solution like that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resid ] .",
    "this does in fact improve the fit  giving @xmath66 for @xmath67 with an rms of 0.32  s  though it is still formally unacceptable .",
    "we find @xmath68 ( this also changes @xmath26 by 3% from the value in tab .  [",
    "tab : ephem ] ) , giving a timing noise measurement of @xmath69 .",
    "this value is on the high side of , but not outside the range expected from relations between @xmath54 and @xmath70 found for radio pulsars @xcite and magnetars @xcite .",
    "we do not believe it is likely that the third - order solution represents a real long - term change in @xmath26 , since the value of @xmath27 changes significantly if one uses just the _ chandra _ , _ chandra_@xmath39_xmm _ , or all of the data , it may appear that one could obtain a better fit by reducing the cycle count for the 1998 hri point by one ; however , doing that , the other _ rosat _  points can not be reproduced any more . ] [ 8(6 ) , 18(4 ) , or @xmath71 @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , or @xmath75 respectively ] .",
    "a second possibility is a sudden change in rotation  a glitch , as proposed ( and largely rejected ) by @xcite to account for variations in spectral shape ( differences of 10% in the inferred temperature ) and pulse shape ( changes of 50100% in pulsed fraction ) observed between 2000 and 2003 .",
    "the systematic increase in the residuals after mjd  53000 in figure  [ fig : resid ] might indeed indicate a glitch .",
    "we tried fitting a simple glitch model , in which we assumed that only the frequency changed , that the recovery time was longer than the span of our observations , and that the glitch occurred on 2003 july 1 ( mjd  52821 ) , in between the two _ xmm _",
    "observations that showed the largest spectral change @xcite .",
    "we find a reasonable fit for a glitch with @xmath76  hz and a recovery time @xmath77  yr , giving @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resid ] ) .",
    "this would be a small glitch , with @xmath79 compared to values of @xmath80 to @xmath81 for radio pulsars ( with smaller values more typical for larger magnetic fields ; * ? ? ?",
    "it also implies that energetically , the putative glitch would be insignificant : the change in kinetic energy of @xmath82  ergs @xcite would only be noticeable if dissipated in @xmath7  day given the bolometric luminosity of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  of @xmath83 ( where @xmath84  pc is the distance to rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 ; @xcite ) . in principle , however , it could still have altered the light curve and spectrum of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  through realignment of the magnetic field relative to the spin axis .",
    "finally , a more mundane explanation for the relatively poor fit is that the data are from different instruments with different energy responses ( even among a single instrument aboard _ xmm _ , the changing filters alter the response ) .",
    "the pulse profile of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  is known to depend on energy ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) and to change over time @xcite .",
    "while the changes to the shape are small , some systematic offsets are expected between the pulse profiles as measured by different instruments or at different times .",
    "we hope to investigate this in more detail in the near future .    at present",
    ", we can not distinguish between the various possibilities for the relatively poor fits .",
    "the predicted future behavior is different , however , and thus further observations of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  ( some of which are in progress ) should be able to distinguish between these models .",
    "from our timing solution , we infer a spin - down rate @xmath85 . this is consistent with the limits derived in and by @xcite , but inconsistent with the tentative solution of @xcite , who found @xmath86 at 99% confidence ( but who noted that elements of their solution were inconsistent with each other and that their analysis was subject to confusing aliases ) . in table  [ tab : ephem ] , we list derived parameters  rotational energy loss rate , magnetic field , and characteristic age ( the latter two under the assumption of magnetic dipole spin - down ) .    the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 place rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  well above above most of the radio - pulsar `` death - lines ''",
    "proposed so far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in a region populated by radio pulsars in @xmath53-@xmath54 diagrams like that in ( its parameters are approximately between those of psr  j1830@xmath01135 , with @xmath87  s , @xmath88 , and psr  j1847@xmath00130 , with @xmath89  s , @xmath90 ) .",
    "hence , rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  may well be a radio pulsar itself , but one whose radio beam(s ) do not intersect our line of sight .",
    "its inferred magnetic field , @xmath91  g , is not exceptional ; the parkes multi - beam survey @xcite in particular has discovered a fair number of radio pulsars with @xmath92  g ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is now clear the distribution of magnetic fields is flatter than previously assumed @xcite .    with @xmath93 ,",
    "rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  is not expected to have much non - thermal x - ray emission : from the relation of @xcite , one estimates @xmath94 , much smaller than the thermal emission , @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with limits from _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm _  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "what is somewhat puzzling is the inferred age of 2  myr .",
    "tracing rx  j0720.4@xmath03125back to ob associations where it might have been born put it close to the trumpler  10 association @xmath96  myr ago ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , based on its estimated temperature and luminosity , most standard cooling models ( modified urca for @xmath97 neutron stars ) put rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  at @xmath98  myr ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is of course possible that rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  was born with a long period and/or had significantly non - dipole braking , such that the spin - down age is not a good estimate of its true age .",
    "however , no case with as long a birth period as would be required for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  is known among radio pulsars ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possible explanation is that rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  was ejected from a binary system with a massive companion @xmath99  myr ago , either when the companion underwent a supernova or during a binary exchange interaction . in this case , a relatively long period is expected : if the neutron star accreted matter from its companion , its spin period would have tended toward the equilibrium period , @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 is the accretion rate and @xmath102 is the eddington rate )",
    ". a relatively short cooling age would also be consistent with this model : the accretion and accompanying steady hydrogen burning could reheat the neutron star ( or keep it hot ) . of course , it remains to be seen that a suitable evolutionary scenario can be found . in any case",
    ", the prediction for the model with two supernovae is that there may well be another @xmath103myr old neutron star whose proper motion traces back to the same origin as rx  j0720.4@xmath03125(cf . * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we can compare the magnetic field strength of @xmath4  g with what is inferred from the broad absorption feature in the spectrum ( observed to be at 0.3  kev , which corresponds to 0.39  kev at the surface for a gravitational redshift of 0.3 ; @xcite ) . if due to a proton cyclotron line , one infers @xmath104  g @xcite , which is substantially larger than inferred from the spin - down .",
    "this may simply reflect the inadequacy of the dipole spin - down model , or the presence of higher order multipoles . on the other hand , based on a comparison with other sources , @xcite suggested that the absorption feature was due to the transition from the ground state to the second excited tightly bound state of neutral hydrogen , which would require @xmath105  g and matches the spin - down value nicely .",
    "if that is the case , higher signal - to - noise spectra should reveal the transition to the first excited state at @xmath106kev .",
