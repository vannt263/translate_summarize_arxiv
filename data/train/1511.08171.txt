    "eclipsing binary v0873 per ( tyc 2853 - 18 - 1 ) was discovered by @xcite using published data from the northern sky variability survey @xcite .",
    "the v magnitude range of this system is @xmath2 and its light curve was identified as an ew - type , orbital period was found to be @xmath3 days . @xcite give the next ephemeris for v0873 per :    @xmath4    @xcite conducted spectral and photometry investigations of v0873 per .",
    "they estimated spectral class of the primary ( more massive ) star as k0v@xmath51 ( effective temperature @xmath6 ) , while spectral class of secondary component was not studied .",
    "v0873 per was found to be among the w - type w uma contact binaries .",
    "@xcite solution reveals that the less massive , slightly hotter component is eclipsed at phase zero .",
    "the mass ratio of the system is @xmath7 and is likely tending toward larger mass ratios as the secondary component is consumed by the primary .",
    "@xcite obtained their own ephemeris for v0873 per :    @xmath8    @xcite presented observations of v0873 per in _ bvr _ filter bands .",
    "photometric solutions showed that this system is a w - type with a mass ratio of q = 2.504 ( @xmath9 ) , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "the derived contact degree was found to be f = 18.10%(@xmath10% ) .",
    "@xcite suspected the cyclic variation with the period of about 4 years that could be due to existence of the third companion in the system or the mechanism of magnetic activity cycle in the binary .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study v0873 per using timing of light minima from literature and our observations in order to find possibly existing new bodies in this system .",
    "we found a possible evidence in favour of existence of a third body with a mass equal to mass of a tiny star .",

    "photometric observations of eclipsing binary system v0873 per were performed during september , october and november 2013 ( 10 nights ) and august 2014 ( 4 nights ) at south station of m. v. lomonosov moscow state university in nauchnij , crimea at the altitude about 600 meters above sea level .",
    "we used an apogee ccd camera ap-47p ( @xmath11 pixels ) attached to the cassegrain focus of a zeiss-600 telescope .",

    "observational material was obtained as a result of continuous and prolonged ( 6 - 8 hours ) monitoring in _ r@xmath12 _ band .",
    "the exposure time was set to be 25 - 30 seconds , therefore typical measurement errors were @xmath13 .",
    "exposure and readout cycle take about 1.5 minutes during observations . during some observational nights we used a field lens in front of the ccd camera to increase the field of view from @xmath14 arc min to @xmath15 arc min . in figure [ f1 ]",

    "we can not offer an explanation of this high deviation and suppose that it arises from data processing and algorithms of minima time finding ( for example , if individual observations of light curve during those nights were performed with significantly longer breaks between points in comparison with other observations ) rather than from physical processes . ] marked by `` @xmath18 '' in the table [ lit ] , we obtain @xmath19 for our period @xmath20 and @xmath21 for period @xmath22 years found by @xcite . this value is less than previous values for both periods of minima time variations and allows us to conclude that the system has light equation which we explain by the existence of a third body . in this case",
    "( without three marked points ) orbital period of the third body is @xmath20 and amplitude of light equation is @xmath23 seconds .",
    "we can not exclude 4 years variations found by @xcite .",
    "this fact does not allow to prefer one of these periods of time of minima variations and it is possible that both of them are valid , also there is a possibility that only one of these periodical variations is real .",
    "@xcite could not make a final conclusion about nature of the time variation and choose between the magnetic activity and the gravitational influence of a third body on the period of v0873 per .",
    "therefore , future photometric and especially spectroscopic investigations of this system are required .",
    "further text describes our result in terms of the existence of a third body .",

    "in general task of precise determination of mass of a circumbinary third body is a separate complicated investigation .",
    "inclination angle of the orbit of the third companion from our photometry study stays unknown , therefore at this paper we make only a simple estimation of low limit of the mass of the third body .",
    "this section is valid only if time variations of minima of v0873 per caused by the presence of a third body .",
    "since orbital period of v0873 per is considerably longer , while orbital period of v0873 per is less than @xmath24 . at the same time a third body is able to possess almost stable orbit if its orbital period begins from @xmath25 days , see table 6 in @xcite .",
    "so , one can apply kepler s third law for such body ( for rough estimations , because strong disturbances of the orbit should exist ) . ]",
    "than orbital period of central binary star we can use kepler s third law for our simple estimations of mass .    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the orbital period of a third body in days , @xmath28 is the semi - major axis of its orbit in solar radii , @xmath29 is total mass of all companions of the system in solar masses . according to spectral type k0v of the primary component of v0873",
    "per and mass ratio 2.6 ( by @xcite ) summary mass of central binary stars is @xmath30 .",
    "orbital period derived from our observations and information from literature is @xmath1 days .",
    "these quantities with equation [ kepler ] give semi - major axis of the third body to be @xmath31 .",
    "amplitude of light equation is 85 seconds . during this interval of time",
    "light travels a half of the distance which the third body displaces the central binary . consequently semi - major axis of the orbit of the center of mass of binary star v0873 per around the center of mass of the system `` v0873 per + third body '' is @xmath32 .",
    "this gives us ratio of mass of the third body to mass of the central binary to be @xmath33 , so the mass of the third body is @xmath0 and corresponds to a red dwarf . if the orbit of the third body is inclined with respect to the orbit of the central binary , an estimation of its mass should be increased .",
    "the same estimation can be made for 4 years variations of times of minima of the binary .",
    "if this variation exists and the explanation of it is the gravitational influence of a third body , the mass of those body is @xmath34 .",
    "we report about discovery of a third body candidate in eclipsing variable v0873 per .",
    "we found the periodical variation of orbital period of v0873 per with a period @xmath1 days .",
    "this variation explains by the gravitational influence of a third companion on the central binary star .",
    "the low limit of mass of this body is @xmath0 .",
    "moments of minima calculated from our observations can be used in future investigations of v0873 per .",
    "investigations of multiplicity of stars play very important role in understanding of star formation processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) . according to @xcite the fraction of solar type spectroscopic binaries reach up to 96% for binaries with orbital period less than 3 days .",
    "our investigation is in a good agreement with their statement .",
    "v0873 per is a very interesting object and requires additional investigations to verify variations of times of minima of the binary light curve with period of 300 days in this study and 4 year period found by @xcite to explain nature of this system ( gravitational influence of additional bodies in the system and/or @xcite magnetic mechanism ) .",
    "also a more detailed future study of v0873 per probably can help to comprehensively clarify the influence of additional bodies on the central binary and dynamical evolution of orbits in triple / multiple systems , see e. g. some recent papers @xcite .",
