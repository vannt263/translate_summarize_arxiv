    "it has been proposed @xcite that supergravity ( and string theory ) on @xmath6 times a compact manifold is equivalent to a conformal field theory living on the boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "supergravity ( and string theory ) on asymptotically @xmath6 space - time is also expected @xcite to be realized by a boundary field theory on a suitable vacuum .",
    "investigations of the bulk quantum gravity , in particular , to clarify @xmath7 black holes as the quantum gravitational states , will lead a deeper insight on our understanding of the @xmath8 correspondence . in three dimensions ,",
    "a description of gravity in terms of gauge theory @xcite is known , by which quantum gravity in three dimensions seems to be tractable and thus consideration about such quantum gravitational states will become possible .    in this article",
    "we present a quantization of @xmath0-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant @xmath9 and thereby investigate quantum aspects of the @xmath0-dimensional black holes from the perspective of the @xmath10 correspondence .",
    "the quantization consists of the following two procedures .",
    "the first is related with quantization of the asymptotic virasoro symmetry found by brown and henneaux @xcite . to describe it we introduce in section 2 a notion of the virasoro deformation of three - geometry .",
    "it is originally defined as a deformation of a suitable non - compact simply - connected region in @xmath5 and is given by the coadjoint action of the virasoro groups @xmath11 . induced metric from @xmath5 provides a metric of the deformed region .",
    "given a black hole , we can take , as such a non - compact simply - connected region , a covering space of the exterior of the outer horizon .",
    "its virasoro deformation commutes with the projection .",
    "therefore we can obtain a family of the deformed quotients .",
    "this defines the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon of the black hole .",
    "the induced metric of the deformed region becomes that of its quotient , which can be understood as a deformed metric of the black hole obtained in @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic virasoro symmetry turns out to be the infinitesimal form of this deformation .",
    "the family of the deformed quotients will be identified with a product of the coadjoint orbits of the virasoro groups @xmath2 labeled by mass and angular momentum of the black hole together with the cosmological constant . in section 3",
    "we provide quantization of the asymptotic virasoro symmetry or the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon .",
    "it is prescribed by quantization of the corresponding coadjoint orbits .",
    "quantization of each orbit turns out to give a unitary irreducible representation of the virasoro algebra with central charge @xmath12 .",
    "state of the black hole becomes the primary state of the representation .",
    "all the excited states of the representation correspond to the local excitations by the virasoro deformation , that is , as noted in @xcite , gravitons .",
    "@xmath13 is also examined .",
    "quantization of its virasoro deformation turns out to provide a unitary irreducible representation , in which state of @xmath13 is the @xmath14-invariant primary state .",
    "although the quantization of the virasoro deformations leads the unitary irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra , it is not sufficient as a quantization of three - dimensional gravity .",
    "if one takes the perspective of @xmath14 chern - simons gravity @xcite , the virasoro deformation corresponds to local degrees of freedom of the theory and , in order to make the quantization complete , we must take into account of the global degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ , holonomies .",
    "we start section 4 by discussing their quantization . having quantized holonomies ,",
    "it is very reasonable to expect from the perspective of the @xmath15 correspondence that , by an identification of these topological operators with the zero modes of a suitable two - dimensional quantum field , the unitary irreducible representations obtained by the quantization of the virasoro deformations could be reproduced as the hilbert space of the two - dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "this expectation turns out to be true at least when @xmath4 .",
    "the holonomy variables will be identified with the zero modes of a real scalar field @xmath16 , which is interpreted as the liouville field .",
    "the state of @xmath13 is identified with the @xmath17-invariant vacuum of this conformal field theory .",
    "the states of the black holes are the primary states obtained from the vacuum by an operation of the corresponding vertex operators .",
    "excitations of the liouville field are equivalent with the generators of the virasoro deformation .",
    "this field theory admits to have continuous spectrums as expected .    having obtained the quantization of three - dimensional gravity by the liouville field theory , the following question may arise : how can one understand the three - dimensional black holes in two dimensions where the liouville field lives ?",
    "the liouville field theory is living on a two - sphere which is obtained by a compactification of the boundary cylinder at infinity of the black holes . to answer this question it becomes necessary to understand how the virasoro deformation recognizes the outer horizon of the black hole .",
    "it will be shown at the end of section 4 that it recognizes the outer horizon not as a two - dimensional object but as a one - dimensional object in @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the boundary liouville field @xmath16 can see the outer horizon only as a one - dimensional object .",
    "compactification of the boundary cylinder to a sphere simultaneously makes the solid cylinder to a three - ball , by which this one - dimensional outer horizon intersects with the boundary sphere at two points .",
    "the boundary liouville field theory recognizes its intersections as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator .",
    "a microscopic description of the three - dimensional black holes has been proposed by carlip @xcite and strominger @xcite using a conformal field theory on the horizon .",
    "since the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon can not recognize the horizon as a two - dimensional object , the boundary liouville field theory can not be equivalent to the horizon conformal field theory . in section 5",
    "we propose two possible descriptions of the horizon conformal field theory .",
    "one is a string theory in the background of a macroscopic string living in @xmath5 .",
    "worldvolume of the macroscopic string should be identified with the two - dimensional outer horizon , by which we can obtain the virasoro algebra on the horizon as its fluctuation by microscopic string .",
    "the other is a conformal field theory which could be obtained by the virasoro deformation of the region between the inner and outer horizons of the black hole .",
    "the second possibility seems to imply an interpretation of the conjecture made by maldacena @xcite , in terms of a gauge transformation .",
    "the btz black holes . ] @xcite are three - dimensional black holes specified by their mass and angular momenta .",
    "the btz black hole with mass @xmath18 and angular momentum @xmath19 will be denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "one can avoid a naked singularity by imposing the bound , @xmath21 , on the allowed value of its angular momentum . in terms of the schwarzschild coordinates @xmath22 , where the ranges are taken @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the black hole metric @xmath26 has the form @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath30 and given by @xmath31 the outer and inner horizons are located respectively at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "information about the mass and angular momentum is encoded in @xmath34 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is newton constant . in the case of @xmath37 , the black hole",
    "is called extremal .",
    "it holds @xmath38 and then the outer and inner horizons coincide with each other . when @xmath39 , it is called non - extremal .",
    "the exterior of the outer horizon @xmath32 of the btz black hole will play an important role throughout this paper .",
    "we denote the exterior of the outer horizon of @xmath20 by @xmath40 .",
    "that is , @xmath41 .",
    "it is known @xcite that the black hole can be identified with an appropriate quotient of @xmath5 .",
    "we will need a further detailed description of this relation between @xmath40 and @xmath5 . in this subsection",
    "we provide it for the case of the non - extremal black holes , that is , the case of @xmath42 .",
    "discussion presented here becomes a prototype for the other cases , which will be treated briefly in the next section .",

    "now we will ask what it gives rise to .",
    "we can assume reasonably that @xmath491 slices of @xmath40 are compactified to @xmath483 and @xmath484 of the @xmath490 .",
    "if one accepts this assumption , the outer horizon must be compactified to @xmath483 and @xmath484 of @xmath490 .",
    "this is because the @xmath491 slices of @xmath40 include the outer horizon after the completion .",
    "see fig.3 .",
    "this shows that the intersections of the black hole with the boundary sphere are realized by the vertex operators as described in ( [ norm by path - integral 2 ] ) .",
    "see fig.8 .",
    "to provide a microscopic description of black holes in quantum gravity or string theory is a very impressive and enlightening issue .",
    "for the three - dimensional black holes such a microscopic description has been proposed by carlip @xcite and strominger @xcite .",
    "it states that microscopic states of the black holes are the states of a conformal field theory on the horizon .",
    "although at present we do not know exactly what conformal fields do live on the horizon , their proposal makes it possible to give statistical mechanical explanations of the thermodynamical properties of the black hole .    receiving their proposal",
    ", many questions will arise .",
    "first of all , can one identify the boundary liouville field theory with a conformal field theory on the horizon ?",
    "our answer is no .",
    "as explained at the end of the last section , the virasoro deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon can not recognize the horizon as a two - dimensional object .",
    "it can recognize the horizon only as a one - dimensional object .",
    "this means that the virasoro algebra obtained from the deformation can not be the virasoro algebra on the horizon . on the other hand",
    ", this deformation provides the asymptotic virasoro algebra , which generators are gravitons in bulk and are identified with the excitations of the boundary liouville field .",
    "this field theory has the continuous spectrums . therefore these two conformal field theories are by no means equivalent to each other .",
    "if one accepts this answer , one might be led to another question : what conformal field theory is living on the horizon ? to this question",
    "we can not answer definitely . here",
    "we would like to propose two possible descriptions of this conformal field theory .",
    "the first one is based on a simple hypothesis : the virasoro algebra of the horizon conformal field theory should generate the virasoro deformation of the horizon . to work this hypothesis , we need , first of all , to treat the outer horizon as a _ two - dimensional _ object .",
    "if one takes the chern - simons gravity viewpoint , it is doubtful whether one can handle the outer horizon as a two - dimensional object . to be successful",
    ", presumably one needs the string theory viewpoint .",
    "namely , if the two - dimensional horizon is identified with a macroscopic string in @xmath5 , the horizon conformal field theory would be string theory on this background .",
    "it describes quantum fluctuations of the macroscopic string and will lead the microscopic description of the black holes .",
    "but it is not clear , at least for us , to what extent this string theory is analyzable .",
    "the second possible description of the horizon conformal field theory is based on the hypothesis : the virasoro deformation of the region between the inner and outer horizons should lead the virasoro algebra on the horizon conformal field theory .",
    "this hypothesis can be regarded as an analogue which we used in the construction of the boundary liouville field theory .",
    "in particular it may allow us to follow the similar step as we took for the study of the exterior of the outer horizon .    to be explicit , let us consider the region between the inner and outer horizons of the non - extremal btz black hole @xmath20",
    ". we will call it @xmath492 .",
    "@xmath493 @xmath494 . ] a covering space of @xmath492 is given by a non - compact simply - connected region of @xmath5 consisting of the group elements @xmath495 where the ranges of @xmath70 and @xmath63 are taken @xmath496 and @xmath497 .",
    "let us call this region @xmath498 .",
    "the projection can be described by @xmath499 together with the identification @xmath99 .",
    "the induced metric of @xmath498 has the form @xmath500 and is isometric to @xmath501 .",
    "therefore @xmath498 is indeed the covering space .",
    "@xmath492 is identified with the quotient of @xmath498 , @xmath502 where the equivalence relation is @xmath503 . as is done in the study of @xmath60 ,",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the group element ( [ z1 non - ex ] ) in the form @xmath504 description of @xmath498 in terms of the chern - simons gravity is given by the flat connection @xmath505 which is determined by the prescription ( [ def of a0 ] ) using a decomposition of @xmath506 into the following @xmath74-valued functions @xmath507 : @xmath508 a slight comparison between @xmath509 and @xmath78 given in ( [ hpm non - ex ] ) shows that the flat connection @xmath510 is gauge - equivalent to @xmath84 ( [ a0 non - ex ] ) , the flat connection which describes @xmath60 , the covering space of the exterior of the horizon : @xmath511 where the gauge transformation @xmath512 is given by @xmath513 and @xmath514 .",
    "this gauge equivalence should be understood as a formal one because the allowed ranges of the coordinates are different from each other .",
    "( for @xmath84 ( [ a0 non - ex ] ) the range of @xmath111 is @xmath515 while for @xmath510 , @xmath516 . ) nevertheless , if one takes the existence of such a gauge transformation seriously , one may arrive at an idea that a deformation of @xmath498 could be constructed in such a manner that it is related with the virasoro deformation of @xmath60 by an appropriate gauge transformation . thus obtained deformation will define the virasoro deformation of @xmath498 and thereby that of @xmath492 , the region between the inner and outer horizons of the black hole .",
    "the corresponding conformal field theory will be regarded as the horizon conformal field theory .",
    "the second description of the horizon conformal field theory may provide another interpretation of the surprising conjecture made by maldacena @xcite , which may be understood in our situation as a correspondence between the boundary and horizon conformal field theories under a suitable renormalization group flow .",
    "the second description , if it is correct , implies a possibility of a realization of this correspondence in terms of gauge transformation .",
