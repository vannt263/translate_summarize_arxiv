    "in many applications of solid mechanics , such as modeling cracks , structural defects , or nanoelectromechanical systems , the classical continuum description is not suitable , and it is required to utilize an atomistic description of materials .",
    "however , full atomistic simulations are prohibitively expensive ; hence there is a need for efficient numerical methods that couple a continuum description of a material in the region where material deformation is smooth and an atomistic description where the variations of the deformation gradient are large .",
    "all atomistic / continuum ( a / c ) coupling methods can be divided into two categories : the energy - based coupling and the force - based coupling .",
    "energy - based coupling @xcite consists of composing the energy of the system depending on both discrete and continuum deformations , and driving the system to a stable equilibrium .",
    "a major challenge for energy - based a / c coupling is the presence of ghost forces  the spurious forces that create an error in the solution near the a / c interface that can not be reduced by enlarging the atomistic region or refining the computational mesh in the continuum region .    in this paper",
    "the term _ consistent _ will be used as a synonym for the absence of ghost forces .",
    "it has been recently proved in two dimensions ( 2d ) under some rather general technical assumptions , that absence of ghost forces implies first - order consistency @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite it is shown directly that the proposed method exhibits a first - order convergence rate .    in one dimension ( 1d ) the problem of consistent zero - temperature static energy - based coupling is easy to solve @xcite .",
    "however , in higher dimensions this is a true challenge . in the case of nearest neighbor interaction",
    "there are methods that are free from ghost forces ( the coupling of length scales method @xcite is an example of such a method ) , but in a general situation all existing coupling methods introduce a certain interfacial error .",
    "several methods have been proposed to address the problem of consistent energy - based coupling , including the quasinonlocal ( qnl ) quasicontinuum method @xcite and the geometrically consistent scheme ( gcs ) @xcite , which may be regarded as a generalization of qnl .",
    "the latter method consists of two steps : first , passing from general finite range interaction to a nearest neighbor interaction in a padding region between the atomistic and continuum region , and second , passing from the nearest neighbor atomistic model to the continuum model .",
    "e , lu , and yang showed that the latter method exhibits no ghost forces in 1d and no ghost forces in higher dimensions in the case of a straight ( planar ) interface with no corners @xcite .    another noteworthy effort to minimize the ghost forces",
    "is a work of klein and zimmerman @xcite who considered a problem of coupling in arbitrarily overlapping atomistic and continuum regions . assuming a two - body interatomic potential , they proposed a method of computing the contributions of the atomistic bonds in the overlapping region by numerically minimizing the ghost forces using the least squares technique .",
    "the analysis of energy - based methods reveals the following advantages of consistent energy - based methods in 1d : ( i ) their error can be efficiently controlled as opposed to a finite error of nonconsistent methods @xcite , and ( ii ) their region of stable deformations essentially coincides with the one of the atomistic model , whereas inconsistent methods significantly underpredict the critical strain @xcite .    in the force - based methods @xcite ,",
    "the equilibrium is achieved by computing the generalized forces for each degree of freedom ( associated with the atoms and the finite element nodes ) and driving them to zero .",
    "the force - based methods are the most commonly used a / c coupling methods , as most of them exhibit no ghost forces by construction . however , there are difficulties arising from the force field being nonconservative @xcite .",
    "in summary , consistent energy - based methods have good accuracy and stability properties ; however , the existing energy - based methods are consistent only in a few special cases .",
    "the force - based coupling is the most popular alternative to the energy - based coupling , but the force - based methods are not sufficiently well understood at present .    in the present paper a new consistent energy - based a / c coupling is proposed .",
    "the coupling is based on judiciously treating the atomic bonds near the a / c interface by consistently defining their contributions to the discrete and the continuum energy .",
    "two variants of the method are formulated ; the first one couples the atomistic and the continuum energies through the atoms inside the continuum region , and the second one performs coupling only through the interface .",
    "the scope of the present paper is limited to a two - body interaction potential , one or two spatial dimensions , and piecewise linear finite element discretization of the continuum deformation ( the latter assumption is only required for the two - dimensional case ) .",
    "no restrictions on the finite element mesh ( except that its nodes are positioned at the lattice sites ) are made .",
    "we note that essentially the same method in one - dimensional setting has been independently proposed and analyzed by li and luskin @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec:1d_coupling ] introduces the problem of a / c coupling and briefly discusses major difficulties . in section [ sec:1d_method ]",
    "the proposed methods are presented in detail in a one - dimensional setting and then extended to a two - dimensional case in sections [ sec : manyd ] and [ sec:2d : acc ] .",
    "the numerical experiments illustrating performance of the proposed methods are presented in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of the results ( section [ sec : discussion ] ) and concluding remarks ( section [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "in order to give a more vivid illustration of the proposed methods , we will start with a one - dimensional problem formulation followed by a detailed presentation of the proposed methods in 1d ( section [ sec:1d_method ] ) .",
    "we will then show how to extend the proposed methods to 2d in sections [ sec : manyd ] and [ sec:2d : acc ] .      consider a one - dimensional atomistic material described by positions of atoms in the reference configuration as @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . for simplicity we set the lattice parameter @xmath2 .",

    "it should also be noted that the regions were chosen in this way only for ease of visualization , and the discussion below is valid for a more general family of regions @xmath67 , @xmath44 , and @xmath63 . after presenting and discussing the proposed methods in 1d",

    "we formulate the energy - based quasicontinuum ( qce ) method @xcite , show that it has ghost forces , and describe the existing energy - based strategies of removing them .",
    "the presence of ghost forces has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite ; hence the present discussion will be very brief and will only serve to contrast the ideas of the proposed method with the existing methods .",
    "qce can be defined as follows .",

    "this can be further simplified , assuming a piecewise affine interpolation in @xmath44 ( then @xmath84 ) : @xmath85 which is clearly nonzero .",
    "the interpretation of presence of the nonzero ( ghost ) force , for instance , on atom @xmath86 can be as follows .",
    "the interaction of atoms @xmath86 and @xmath87 is computed two times in a different manner : once according to the continuum strain @xmath88 and once according to the exact strain @xmath89 .",
    "the first computation contributes the force only to the continuum region , which causes a loss of balance of forces on the atom @xmath86 .",
    "the energy - based approach to removing the ghost forces is to modify the energy @xmath90 in such a way that the uniform deformation @xmath54 is the solution to the equations . in the context of the quasicontinuum method ,",
    "this was first done in @xcite for the second nearest neighbor ( @xmath80 ) and then generalized in @xcite to longer interactions . however , when generalizing these methods from dimension one to higher dimensions , additional difficulties arise , for instance , related to transition between so - called element - based and atom - based summation rules near interface corners ( i.e. , interface edges and vertices in three dimensions ) @xcite .",
    "we propose a strategy of constructing a consistent coupling of the atomistic and the continuum models . the strategy is based on splitting the energy of atomic bonds into atomistic and continuum contributions .",
    "we start with introducing some preliminary terms and definitions .",
    "the term _ bond _ between atoms @xmath1 and @xmath91 will refer to an open interval @xmath92 .",
    "introduce the set of all bonds in the atomistic system @xmath93 we denote the potential energy of a bond @xmath92 as @xmath94 and call it the _ exact contribution _ of the bond @xmath95 to the potential energy .",

    "the following proposition states that the variation of the exact contribution of a bond @xmath100 coincides with the variation of the continuum contribution of @xmath100 on a uniform deformation @xmath38 .",

    "we hence name it the method of combining _ the exact and the continuum contributions _ ( ecc ) of the bonds ( hereinafter referred to as the _ ecc method _ ) .",
    "the ecc method is consistent , i.e. , @xmath105    the consistency of follows directly from proposition [ prop : e_c_variations ] and the identity : @xmath106    the remainder of this subsection will be devoted to showing that @xmath107 can be computed efficiently , i.e. , without a need to go through all the bonds @xmath108 . more precisely , we will show the validity of the following proposition .",

    "the method proposed in the previous subsection consists of treating each bond that does not fully lie in the continuum region atomistically and modifying the continuum energy by subtracting the corresponding contribution from the continuum energy . since the positions of atoms which are strictly inside @xmath44 enter the expression of the total energy , the coupling between regions becomes nonlocal . for implementation",
    "it could be more preferable to have a coupling through the interface only . in this subsection",
    "we present such a method .",

    "the prominent feature of the method is that the atomistic part of the energy depends only on the deformation in the atomistic region and on the interface .",
    "this may be more convenient for implementation ( see section [ sec : implementation ] ) and can potentially help in parallelization of the method .",
