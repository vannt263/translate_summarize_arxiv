    "study of structure of light exotic nuclei , lying near the drip lines and so - called halo nuclei is one of the most interesting topics of low - energy nuclear physics [ 113 ] .",
    "it has revealed a number of features inherent only for these nuclei but not for normal ( non - halo ) nuclei , such as rather low separation energies of the external ( `` valence '' ) nucleons , large radii and narrow peaks observed in the breakup probability distribution .",
    "two - nucleon halo nuclei are particularly striking since the lowest breakup channel is a three - body ( core+``valence '' nucleons ) channel because of the fact that their two - body subsystems are unbound .",
    "therefore , for these nuclei a main term of the asymptotics of wave functions must be determined by proper three - body asymptotics @xcite .    for more than ten years",
    "several works have been devoted to the study of the asymptotics of three - body bound state radial wave functions of halo nuclei [ 15 - 19 ] . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the asymptotic expressions have been derived for three - body systems with two neutrons for the case of short - range ( nuclear ) interactions .",
    "these asymptotics were derived in the context of hyperspherical coordinates for large values of the hyperradius @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , which means that either both of the jacobi coordinates tend to infinity @xcite or one of them tends to infinity and another of them is very small @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the result of @xcite was generalized for three - body systems including two charged particles with taking into account coulomb - nuclear interactions .",
    "the obtained asymptotic expressions contain an exponential function depending on the hyperradius @xmath7 @xcite but also involve a factor that can influence noticeably the asymptotic values of the three - body wave function for some directions in the configuration space determined by the hyperangle @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are a pair of modified jacobi coordinates @xcite ) . in refs.@xcite and @xcite ,",
    "these asymptotic expressions have been compared with the asymptotic behaviour of three - body ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) radial wave functions of the @xmath15he and @xmath16be nuclei respectively derived in refs.@xcite and @xcite within the framework of the multicluster stochastic dynamical model , respectively , where only two forms for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 potentials are used . in refs .",
    "[ 1517 ] , information was obtained about the three - body asymptotic normalization function ( tbanf ) as a function of the hyperangle @xmath9 .",
    "however , as is revealed in [ 1517 ] , the three - body radial wave functions of the @xmath15he and @xmath16be nuclei @xcite have a correct asymptotic behaviour in an asymptotical region within the interval with narrow width .",
    "besides , the binding energies of @xmath15he and @xmath16be nuclei in the ( @xmath19)-and ( @xmath20)-channels calculated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , differ noticeably from the experimental ones and , consequently , this circumstance may also noticeably influence the tbanfs [ 1517 ] .    in ref.@xcite , the asymptotic expression has been derived for three - body radial wave functions of the halo nucleus with two valence neutrons in the context of the relative core - neutron coordinates for large values of each of them .",
    "it was revealed that the asymptotic expression obtained in @xcite is not directly comparable to that derived in @xcite but it becomes equivalent to the asymptotic form derived in @xcite when the core is heavy . as a result , in ref.@xcite , information about the values of the tbanfs has been obtained by means of comparative analysis of the obtained asymptotic forms with the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding model three - body ( @xmath21 ) wave functions for the @xmath15he nucleus derived within the lagrange - mesh technique @xcite by using the @xmath22 potential taken from @xcite . there",
    "it was shown that the lagrange - mesh approximate wave function for the bound @xmath15he state is in good agreement with the asymptotic expression over larger values of the relative core - neutron coordinates ( up to 20 fm ) and information was obtained about the tbanf as a function of the ratio of the relative core - neutron coordinates .",
    "it should be noted that in @xcite the binding energy calculated for the ground state of @xmath15he is in excellent agreement with the experimental one for the employed @xmath23 and @xmath17 potentials .    in this connection",
    "it should be emphasized that the tbanf is a fundamental characteristic of the three - body bound system , which plays the same role as the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the radial wave function for the two - body bound system @xcite .",
    "consequently , the tbanf is determined by the dynamics of strong interactions and , so , carries information about two - particle ( nuclear ) interactions in the three - body bound system .",
    "for example , as is shown in @xcite and @xcite , the extracted values of the tbanfs for the @xmath15he and @xmath16be nuclei are highly sensitive to the forms of the @xmath24 and @xmath18 potentials , respectively .",
    "consequently , knowledge of the tbanf , which plays an important role in nuclear structure , allows one to get the information both on the three - body structure of halo nuclei and on types of two - particle ( cluster - cluster , cluster - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon ) interactions .",
    "besides , as is shown in @xcite , the anomalous asymptotics of radial overlap integrals for bound systems @xmath25 of four bodies in the ( @xmath26+@xmath27)-channel is expressed in terms of the tbanf . therefore , systematic collection of data about tbanfs for different halo nuclei must be extremely encouraged now .    in the present work ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the radial wave functions of a three - body bound ( 123)-system involving two charged particles is studied for the large relative coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the results are compared with the lagrange - mesh approximate three - body ( @xmath0 ) radial wave functions derived by d. baye @xcite for the halo ( @xmath1=3.562 mev ; @xmath30 ) state of @xmath4 , which is the isobar ",
    "analog one for the ground state of @xmath31 for which @xmath32 and @xmath33 also .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the asymptotic expression for the radial component of three - body wave function is derived . in section 3 , the asymptotic formula is used for testing the asymptotic behavior of the partial waves of the three - body ( @xmath0 ) wave function for the halo ( @xmath1=3.562 mev ) state of the @xmath15li nucleus by using two kinds of the @xmath5 potential , which is briefly described in appendix b. in section 3 , the information about the tbanfs is also analysed and discussed .",
    "conclusion are given in section 4 and the asymptotic formula for the total three - body wave function is derived in appendix a.",
    "one considers the bound three - body system ( 123 ) consisting of two `` valence '' nucleons and two charged particles ( say , particle 1 and a core 3 ) .",

    "one notes that the extracted values of the tbanfs @xmath189 show a noticeable sensitivity to the form of the @xmath5 potential , although the binding energies calculated in the m1 and m2 models are fairly close to each other ( see appendix b ) .",
    "it is now of interest to compare the tbanf values derived by us above for the leading components ( ( @xmath224)=(0,1 ) and ( 1,1 ) ) and the m2 model with those obtained in ref.@xcite for the ground state of @xmath15he(g.s . ) .",

    "the uncertainty for each curve is about @xmath22114% , which is the average square error for the ratio @xmath230 , which involves the uncertainties of the @xmath227 and @xmath231 .",
    "as is seen from figures , the interval of changing the variable @xmath195 can be divided in three parts ( denoted by @xmath232=1 , 2 and 3 ) . in @xmath233 , a value of @xmath195 changes from 1.0 to about 1.1 for which the values of @xmath230 are noticeably larger than 1 .",
    "these values of @xmath195 correspond to rather large values for the ( @xmath234 ) pair , which are the fitting points providing the stable values of the @xmath227 .",

    "as is seen from here , the mirror symmetry for the tbanfs derived for the isobar - analog states of the isobaric ( @xmath242 ) pair breaks up significantly in @xmath233 and @xmath240 .",
    "apparently , this is connected with the fact that an influence of the coulomb @xmath201 interaction upon the derived tbanfs @xmath227 becomes noticeable for the values of @xmath28 changing in @xmath233 and @xmath240 .",
    "nevertheless , in @xmath239 , the mirror symmetry for the tbanf values derived for @xmath243 and @xmath244 occurs within their uncertainties .",

    "although , such expressions are already known in hyperspherical ( or jacobi ) coordinates @xcite , we think that the present formulae are interesting because they allow a simpler physical visualization of the asymptotic behavior as a function of the two core - nucleon relative distances @xmath29 and @xmath28 . it is demonstrated that when the core is very heavy the derived asymptotic forms become equivalent to the corresponding asymptotic formulae @xcite for the jacobi coordinates .",
    "the asymptotic form obtained for the radial wave functions has been compared in different parts of asymptotic regions with the approximate wave functions derived by d. baye @xcite within the lagrange - mesh approach for the halo ( @xmath1=3.562 mev ) state of @xmath15li(@xmath0 ) using two kinds of the nuclear @xmath5 potential .",
    "the intervals of the @xmath29 and @xmath28 variables within which the approximate wave functions have a correct asymptotic behavior within about 10% have been determined .",
    "one has used the region where the agreement between a radial wave function and the asymptotic expressions is excellent to deduce values for the tbanfs , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , for the @xmath248(@xmath1=3.562 mev ) nucleus depending on the ratio @xmath167 .",
    "the shape of the asymptotic behavior is determined by the ratio @xmath249 and the overall normalization is sensitive to the fitting points .",
    "it is demonstrated that the values of the tbanfs are sensitive to the form of the @xmath5 potential used . besides , it is revealed the region of changing the ( @xmath250 ) pair where the mirror symmetry occurs for the tbanfs derived for the isobaric ( @xmath31(g.s.),@xmath248(@xmath1=3.562 mev ) ) pair .",
    "the deduced three - body asymptotic functions are in principle observable quantities , for example , from an analysis of the experimental differential cross sections for the exchange @xmath251(3.562 mev ) and transfer @xmath252(3.562 mev ) reactions .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to compare present results with experimental ones",
    ". it would make it possible to choose the form of the @xmath5 potential by comparing the phenomenological values of @xmath189 ( @xmath39=1 and 2 ) with these values obtained in the present work .",
    "they would allow one to get additional information about the form of the @xmath5 potential and to verify an accuracy of the approximate wave function ( b2 ) as a source of reliable information on the @xmath189 asymptotic normalization functions . in this connection",
    ", it would be highly encouraged to do such an experiment .",
    "the author is deeply grateful to d. baye and l. d. blokhintsev for reading a manuscript , discussions and general encouragement .",
    "the author thanks y. suzuki for interest and d. baye for providing the numerical data calculated for the approximate three - body radial wave functions for @xmath253(@xmath1=3.562 mev ) .",

    "in particular , it was shown in work of ref.@xcite that the derived asymptotic form @xmath255 at @xmath8 contains a factor of osvf for the virtual decay ( 11 ) , which depends on the variables @xmath9 , @xmath270 ( or @xmath271 ) and @xmath272 ( or @xmath273 ) .",
    "besides , in ref.@xcite the important relation between the total osvf and the total three - body asymptotic normalization coefficient @xmath274 has also been found .",
    "the fourier transformation for the total wave function is written as @xmath275 @xmath276 herein the expressions ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) as well as the substitution @xmath277 in eq.(a1 ) are used , where @xmath278 @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "we consider the expression ( a3 ) at @xmath90 and perform integration over @xmath281 in it .",

    "similar to what has been done in ref.@xcite ( see for details , e.g. , section 6 of the chapter 4 there ) an estimation of the leading term of the integrals over @xmath281 at @xmath90 can be done by using the multidimensional method of stationary phase @xcite .",

    "this point can be easily shown if permutation of the order of integration over @xmath321 and @xmath322 is done in ( a1 ) . as a result ,",
    "one obtains the same asymptotic formula ( a17 ) .",
    "this means that asymptotic formula ( a17 ) is valid when both @xmath29 and @xmath28 ( or @xmath323 ) tend to infinity .",
    "the expression ( a17 ) coincides with the asymptotic expression obtained in ref.@xcite for @xmath255 at @xmath8 if in the latter a value of the charge ( @xmath324 ) for the particle 2 is put to zero , the three - body asymptotic normalization factor @xmath325 is substituted by @xmath326 and the hyperradius @xmath7 is determined by either eq.(a11 ) or eq.(a12 ) .",
