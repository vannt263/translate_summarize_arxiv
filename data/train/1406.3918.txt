    "+ in view of the evolution of the deformation vector alogwith energy condition ( i.e. condition on ricci scalar ) , we conclude that for the cases @xmath18 and @xmath143 ( which represents a naked singularity case ) , the geodesic focusing is possible .",
    "however in case of @xmath126 and @xmath96 , geodesics may either diverge or converge depending on initial condition ( whether @xmath154 is positive or negative initially ) and finally become parallel as @xmath154 approaches zero .",

    "also confirms the absence of geodesic focusing for the cases when @xmath126 and @xmath96 .",
