    "in contrast to simple metals such as pb , phase diagrams of unconventional superconductors often show a multitude of electronic phases of matter . in particular , magnetic order is ubiquitous in cuprate oxides and heavy fermion superconductor ( hfsc ) phase diagrams alike , as well as in some ruthenates and cobaltates .",
