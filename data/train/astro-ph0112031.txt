    "our knowledge of background cosmology has recently improved dramatically due to new supernovae and cosmic microwave background data .",
    "current observations favor a flat universe with matter density @xmath4 @xcite and the remaining contribution in the form of cosmological constant @xcite or some other form of dark energy .",
    "the models with cosmological constant are known , however , to suffer from two major problems .",
    "one is related to the origin of the constant - it can not be explained in terms of the vacuum energy since its energy is orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the other is the lack of explanation why the present densities in matter and cosmological constant are comparable",
    ".    a new class of models that solve these problems and also satisfy present observational constraints has been proposed a few years ago @xcite . in these models",
    "the cosmological constant is replaced with a new energy component , called quintessence , characterized by the equation of state @xmath5 .",
    "the component can cluster on largest scales and therefore affect the mass power spectrum @xcite and microwave background anisotropies @xcite .",
    "the investigations of the physical basis for the existence of such component are now more than a decade old @xcite .",
    "one of the promising models is based on so - called  tracker fields \" that display an attractor - like behavior causing the energy density of quintessence to follow the radiation density in the radiation dominated era but dominate over matter density after matter - radiation equality @xcite .",
    "it is still debated , however , how @xmath3 should depend on time , and whether its redshift dependence can be reliably determined observationally @xcite .",
    "a considerable effort has gone into attempts to put constraints on models with quintessence and presently the values of @xmath6 seem most feasible observationally @xcite . here",
    "i review the main characteristics of structure formation in the quintessential universe which may provide constraints on the equation of state . in the last section",
    "i discuss the current status of observational limits on @xmath3 and future perspectives .",
    "quintessence obeys the following equation of state relating its density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath8 @xmath9 the case of @xmath10 corresponds to the usually defined cosmological constant .    the evolution of the scale factor @xmath11 ( normalized to unity at present",

    "the linear evolution of the matter density contrast @xmath28 is governed by equation @xcite @xmath29 where dots represent derivatives with respect to time . for flat models and arbitrary @xmath3 an analytical expression for @xmath30 , the growing mode of the time - dependent part of @xmath31 ,",

    "the peculiar velocity field in linear perturbation theory is obtained from @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the peculiar gravitational acceleration and @xmath40 is the dimensionless velocity factor @xmath41 for flat models this formula can be evaluated analytically using eq .",
    "( [ th8 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath42 at present ( @xmath43 ) for flat models with different @xmath3 is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "we see immediately that the dependence on @xmath3 is very weak . however , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ffz ] , when going to higher redshifts we find that the velocity factor is much more sensitive to @xmath3 which gives some hope for applying it to determine @xmath3 from local peculiar velocity field .",
    "the simplest model of formation of bound objects ( called the spherical or top hat model ) @xcite describes the nonlinear evolution of a uniform spherical density perturbation in an otherwise homogeneous universe . if the overdensity is big enough the perturbed region will slow down the expansion and eventually turn around and collapse .",
    "the evolution of the size of such a perturbation can be described @xcite by the einstein equation @xmath44.\\ ] ] together with the friedmann equation ( [ th1 ] ) it can be solved to obtain the ratio of the cluster density to the background density at the time of turn - around @xmath45 where the last formula is the approximation given in @xcite .",
    "one of the most useful quantities one can derive from the spherical top hat model is the density of the virialized halo in units of the critical density at the time of collapse corresponding to redshift @xmath46 @xmath47 the redshifts @xmath46 and @xmath48 are related by the assumption that the collapse time @xmath49 , the time corresponding to @xmath50 , is twice the turn - around time @xmath51 in reality the object does not decrease its size to zero but virializes to reach the effective final radius @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio by which the halo collapses is estimated from the virial theorem which gives @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 figure  [ dlwwz ] shows how @xmath55 depends on @xmath42 , @xmath3 and the redshift of collapse .",
    "power spectrum @xmath56 is defined as the fourier transform of the correlation function of density fluctuations @xmath57 the spectra for universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) have been widely discussed in the literature , e.g. @xcite . for the present time",

    "the rms density fluctuation , @xmath74 , at comoving smoothing scale @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 where the smoothing is performed with the top hat filter @xmath77 the dependence of @xmath74 on smoothing scale for flat models with different @xmath3 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ pofksig ] .",
    "a particularly useful quantity , constrained by cluster abundance is the rms fluctuation at the scale of @xmath78 mpc .",
    "due to cobe normalization its values turn out to depend strongly on @xmath3 and we get @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "one of the most important measures of structure formation is provided by the mass function of bound objects . using the analytical prescription of press and schechter @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the cumulative mass function ( the comoving number density of objects of mass grater than @xmath81 ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number density of objects with mass between @xmath81 and @xmath84 @xmath85 in the expression above , @xmath86 is the background density , @xmath74 is the rms density fluctuation at comoving smoothing scale @xmath75 described in section  5 .",
    "the mass is related to the smoothing scale by @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 is the halo density at collapse as predicted by linear theory .",
    "we adopt here its standard value @xmath89 ( exact for the einstein - de sitter universe ) since it depends very weakly on @xmath42 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cmfth ] shows the cumulative mass functions calculated from equation ( [ q12 ] ) with @xmath90 and @xmath37 for three models with @xmath91 and @xmath2 .",
    "the strong dependence on @xmath3 is due to the cobe normalization of the power spectra .",
    "the figure also shows data for rich clusters of galaxies from @xcite . for our choice of cosmological parameters",
    "the value of @xmath92 is preferred . however , the press - schechter formulae are known to underestimate the mass functions on the scale of clusters of galaxies when compared to n - body simulations .",
    "the mass functions are also very sensitive to the value of @xmath42 . therefore when",
    "more exact predictions are used and @xmath42 is measured to be close to @xmath93 with a small error bar , we can expect higher values of @xmath3 to be preferred by the cluster data .",
    "the primary constraint on the value of @xmath3 comes from the observations of accelerating expansion , which can only be obtained in models with @xmath94 .",
    "age of universe is quite sensitive to @xmath3 and increases for lower @xmath3 , however the accuracy of our knowledge of both @xmath15 and @xmath95 is not good enough to put strong constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "current estimates are consistent with @xmath96 .",
    "one of the strongest arguments for the existence of dark energy comes from the studies of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "although its power spectrum is weakly sensitive to @xmath3 ( e.g. the height of the first acoustic peak is somewhat increased and its position is shifted to higher multipoles for lower @xmath3 ) , it has already provided some limits . combining the data from cobe and recent balloon experiments balbi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find @xmath97 while baccigalupi _",
    "@xcite estimate the best - fitting value of @xmath3 to be @xmath98 .",
    "the ongoing and future satellite experiments are expected to put even stronger limits on @xmath3 .    among the promising probes of dark energy",
    "are also supernovae ia .",
    "the comoving distance they serve to measure is sensitive only to the interesting cosmological parameters and the errors related to supernova evolution or extinction are estimated to be small .",
    "the existing data restrict @xmath3 only weakly @xcite , but future experiments like the supernova acceleration probe are expected to measure the value of @xmath3 with a few percent accuracy @xcite",
    ".    structure formation also offers methods to constrain the cosmic equation of state .",
    "the suppression of linear growth of density fluctuations for higher @xmath3 alone shows that only for @xmath99 the structure observed today could have evolved from small initial perturbations deduced from cmb observations .",
    "the same range of acceptable @xmath3 values follows from the behaviour of @xmath100 which is a strongly decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "the most promising tests are based on the number counts of galaxy clusters .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the slope of comoving abundance as a function of redshift depends sensitively on @xmath3 and therefore can be used to break degeneracies between @xmath3 and other cosmological parameters that appear e.g. in the analysis of cmb .",
    "such measurements are expected to be performed using the proposed new x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich effect surveys @xcite and the ongoing deep redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the constraints from structure formation appear to be complementary to those from supernovae and cmb measurements .",
