    "the spread of epidemics in complex networks such as biological populations and computer networks is of great current interest , both for practical applications and from a fundamental point of view @xcite .",
    "this is one of the issues of the theory of non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite and the theory of complex networks @xcite .",
    "the problems of interest include the question about the existence of a critical regime separating invasive ( active ) and non - invasive ( absorbing ) states of the system and , if such a transition exists , how it depends on internal and external parameters and also what the universal features of the transition are ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in one of the simplest models of epidemics ,",
    "all the nodes are divided into two classes : infectious ( @xmath0 ) and and susceptible ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the epidemic spreads by a contact process according to which an infected node can transfer infection to another susceptible node with typical infection rate @xmath2 and recover with typical recovery rate @xmath3 becoming again susceptible ( the sis model ) .",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition with variation of the dimensionless parameter , @xmath4 , from the absorbing ( @xmath5 ) to active state ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the critical value is @xmath7 @xcite , with @xmath8 being the typical number of links per node ( coordination number ) .",
    "usually , the infection and recovery rates are assumed to be node independent .",
    "however , in real systems , the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can vary from node to node ( quenched disorder ) .",
    "investigations of contact processes in systems with quenched disorder over recent years @xcite have resulted in some rather intriguing findings . for example , it has been suggested that the disorder can change the universality class of the model @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is far from being completely understood , and the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of a general form of quenched disorder on the dynamics of the contact process in the absorbing state . using a combination of a simple epidemiological model with methods from condensed matter physics ,",
    "we show how disorder in the infection or recovery rates , influences the long - time dynamics ( decay time ) of epidemics in the absorbing state .",
    "this is of practical importance in determining the time to extinction of epidemics within this state .",
    "we also identify a lower bound for @xmath9 and show how the degree of disorder influences the magnitude of the extinction rate .",
    "we consider the dynamics of the contact process far in the absorbing state when the problem can be mapped to the quantum - mechanical one described by the disordered hamiltonian of the anderson - type ( see e.g. @xcite ) and an approximate method ( self - consistent mean - field ) can be applied .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian under this approximation is then used in the analysis of the long - time dynamics of the system .",
    "the advantage of the approach is in the possibility of incorporating a general type of disorder in the analysis while the disadvantage is due to the rather severe restriction of being in the absorbing state ( dilute regime for concentration of infected nodes ) .",
    "our main result is that the disorder slows down the long - time dynamics of the system given the mean values of the random values stay the same as in ordered systems .",
    "the approximate analytical results are supported by exact numerical analysis using a cellular automata approach .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "the formulation of the problem is given in sec .",

    "consider a set of @xmath10 nodes ( sites ) connected to each other by links ( infection paths ) .",
    "each node , @xmath11 , can be in one of two states : infected ( occupied by an `` excitation '' and characterized by occupation number , @xmath12 ) or not infected ( empty with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the occupation number @xmath14 changes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 as a result of infection from an occupied node @xmath17 occurring with infection rate @xmath18 , and from @xmath12 to @xmath13 due to natural recovery with rate @xmath19 .",
    "any state of the system is characterized by the set of occupation numbers , @xmath20 .",
    "bearing in mind the stochastic nature of the infection and recovery processes it is convenient to characterize the system by the state vector @xmath21 , the components of which are the probabilities of finding the system in different states at time @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 runs over all the possible states of the system .",
    "the time evolution of the state vector is governed by the master equation describing the conserved probability flow @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the non - hermitian liouville operator , the non - zero elements of which describe the transitions between the states with different numbers of occupied nodes .",
    "it is convenient to make a linear transformation of the state coordinates ( change of basis ) from @xmath27 to the @xmath28-site probabilities , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the probability of finding node @xmath11 in an occupied ( @xmath12 ) state independent of the occupation of all other nodes .",
    "this allows the master equation  ( [ e1_1 ] ) to be recast in the following form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability of finding the system with the occupied @xmath17-th node and the unoccupied @xmath11-th node , independent of the state of all other nodes .",
    "the single - site probability @xmath30 in eq .",

    "( [ e1_5 ] ) on its own describes the spread of an epidemic in the system of @xmath10 nodes with multiple reinfection of infected nodes where each node can be multiply occupied by the `` excitations '' ( infection ) and @xmath43 has the meaning of an occupation number which can be larger than one .    the approximate master equation ( eq .  ( [ e1_5 ] ) )",
    "similarly to the exact one can also have solutions which behave differently as @xmath44 depending on the typical value of the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , there exists a critical value @xmath46 for the approximate master equation which separates the absorbing and active states and this critical value @xmath46 is smaller than the critical value @xmath47 for the exact master equation due to the nature of the approximations made .",
    "this allows the lower bound estimate , @xmath46 , for @xmath47 to be found by solving the approximate problem for a quite general type of disorder .",
    "the state of the system in the dilute regime can be defined in the subspace of the singly - occupied sites spanned by the orthonormal site basis @xmath48 , and is characterized by the state vector @xmath49 with components @xmath50 .",
    "the master equation  ( [ e1_5 ] ) can be recast as @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the liouville operator which now ( under assumption of symmetric infection rates , @xmath53 ) is hermitian and can be associated with the anderson - like hamiltonian ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath54 in which the recovery rates , @xmath19 , play the role of the on - site energies and the infection rates , @xmath55 , can be associated with the transfer ( hopping ) integrals . both of these values are random and this makes the further analysis non - trivial even in the dilute regime .",
    "the topology of the underlying network of sites , in principle , can be arbitrary but the simplest choice is a regular @xmath56-dimensional lattice with nearest - neighbour interactions only .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we consider a square lattice and thus the second sum in eq .",
    "( [ e1_7 ] ) runs for each site over @xmath57 its nearest neighbours only .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if the on - site matrix elements satisfy the sum rule , @xmath58 , then the number of occupied sites is conserved and the problem is equivalent to the random walk problem on a lattice with random transition rates @xcite , or to the scalar vibrational problem for a lattice with force - constant disorder @xcite .",
    "notice also that decoupling of the single - site probabilities can also be made in the non - dilute regime by assuming that @xmath59 , i.e. ignoring possible correlations in occupation of the communicating sites .",

    "( [ e2_1 ] ) the dynamics of the system in the dilute regime are defined by the eigenspectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "the set of characteristic times ( inverse eigenvalues ) controls the evolution of the system with different eigenvalues being important for different time scales .",
    "the long - time dynamics of the system are defined by the maximum eigenvalue of the hamiltonian , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 in the dilute regime ) and our aim is to find an estimate for @xmath74 and how it depends on the degree of disorder .",
    "the maximum eigenvalue depends on all the recovery and infection rates , @xmath76 , and this obviously complicates its analytical evaluation .",
    "the exact analytical solution of the problem in the general case is not currently known and numerous approximate analytical ( see e.g. @xcite ) and numerical ( see e.g. @xcite ) methods have been developed for evaluation of the spectrum of disordered hamiltonians .",
    "below , we use one of the well - developed self - consistent mean - field approaches ( the homomorphic cluster approximation within the coherent potential approximation @xcite ) to find the estimates for @xmath74 in the case of off - diagonal disorder and compare these results with the exact numerical calculations both for the hamiltonian used in the approximate approach and for the original problem ( cellular automata ( ca ) calculations ) . before analysing the disordered system , we start , however , with a trivial case of an ideal crystalline lattice in order to illuminate our approach .      in the case of an ideal crystalline lattice ,",
    "the probability distribution functions are @xmath77-functions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the translationally invariant solutions of the eigenproblem are well known ( see e.g.@xcite ) , so that the eigenvectors are the bloch s waves characterized by the wavevector @xmath80 , @xmath81 with @xmath82 being the position vector of site @xmath11 and the eigenvalues are @xmath83 where @xmath84 ( the sum is taken over @xmath17 running over the nearest neighbours to arbitrary site @xmath11 ) is the structure factor and the wavevector @xmath80 lies in the first brillouin zone of the reciprocal space so that @xmath85 .",

    "this estimate is equivalent to the standard ( not self - consistent ) mean - field estimate , and , as expected , is less than the true critical value , @xmath93 @xcite .",

    "( [ e2_1a])-([e2_5 ] ) ) . this can be done approximately for lattice models with certain types of disorder , namely , with diagonal disorder ( disorder in the recovery rates , @xmath19 ) , off - diagonal disorder ( disorder in transfer rates , @xmath55 ) , and for binary systems with substitutional disorder ( two species of sites randomly occupy the lattice sites @xcite ) .",
    "one of the successful approximate analytical approaches is the self - consistent mean - field approach ( coherent potential approximation , cpa ) which allows the main spectral features of the disordered hamiltonian and its eigenfunctions to be modelled ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea of the cpa is in replacement of the disordered lattice by the ideal crystalline one which is characterized by the effective complex parameters ( complex fields ) , e.g. by the effective recovery , @xmath103 , and transmission , @xmath104 , rates which depend on the eigenvalues , @xmath105 , of the hamiltonian and should be found self - consistently .",
    "the self - consistency equation follows from the requirement that a single defect placed in the effective crystal does not scatter the effective crystalline eigenfunctions if averaged over disorder .    in what follows , for concreteness",

    "this is a general effect that is independent of the type and form ( probability distribution functions ) of disorder given the mean values of random parameters are the same as for the ordered system .",
    "indeed , any disorder brought to the system is equivalent to introducing additional interactions between the ordered eigenstates which unavoidably result in the level - repelling effect for the bare ( crystalline ) eigenstates @xcite that is to the broadening of the spectrum .",

    "for the eigenstates around the band edges , the fluctuations of random parameters are essential and they lead to strong localization of the eigenstates around the band edges .",
    "in fact , the true ( non mean - field ) density of states shows exponentially decaying band tails instead of sharp band edges typical for the mean - field crystals ( see the inset in fig .",

    "the value of the decrease in the decay rate with increasing disorder , being proportional to the width of the tail , @xmath161 , is naturally small due to the assumptions made , i.e. the system is far in the absorbing state .",

    "the other comment concerns the dependence of the effect on the parameters of the system .",
    "the broadening of the spectrum of the hamiltonian does not depend on the mean recovery rate , @xmath162 .",
    "this means that if @xmath162 increases then the absolute magnitude of the effect within the ca treatment , @xmath163 tends to @xmath164 . if the recovery rate decreases the system approaches the active state and approximations made for the dilute regime break down .",
    "therefore the analysis performed can not be considered as a good approximation around criticality .",
    "in fact , as it follows from the preliminary ca analysis , the value of @xmath163 increases with decreasing @xmath162 and can reach zero around criticality and even change the sign ( to be discussed further elsewhere ) i.e. the introduction of disorder into a crystalline system at criticality causes a transition to the absorbing state rather than further into the active phase .",

    "we have presented the analysis of the contact process in the limit of low density of occupied ( infected ) sites ( see eq .  ( [ e1_4 ] ) ) , i.e. in the dilute regime for the infected sites when all the correlation effects in occupation probabilities can be ignored .",
    "this limit occurs , e.g. when the transfer rate is much smaller than the infection rate , @xmath170 .",
    "the system resides in the absorbing state for such a range of parameters and its dynamics can be described by using the quantum - mechanical tight - binding hamiltonian .",
