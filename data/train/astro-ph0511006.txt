    "the corona can be roughly divided into two sectors with respect to magnetic field configurations on the solar surface .",
    "one is closed field regions in which both footpoints of each field line are rooted at the photosphere .",
    "the other is open field regions in which one footpoint is anchored at the photosphere and the other is open into the interplanetary space .",
    "the open field regions roughly coincide with areas called coronal holes which are dark in x - rays . from the coronal holes , the hot plasma streams out as solar winds .",
    "the wave , generated by the granulations or other surface activities , is a promising candidate operating in the heating and acceleration of solar winds from coronal holes .",
    "it can travel a long distance so that the dissipation plays a role in the heating of the solar wind plasma as well as the lower coronal plasma , in contrast to other processes , such as magnetic reconnection events and compressive waves , the heating of which probably concentrates at lower altitude .",
    "high - frequency ( @xmath12hz ) ioncyclotron waves were recently suggested for the inferred preferential heating of the perpendicular temperature of the heavy ions @xcite , whereas there is still a possibility that the observed temperature anisotropy might be due to a line - of - sight effect @xcite .",
    "however , the protons which compose the main part of the plasma are supposed to be mainly heated by low - frequency ( @xmath13hz ) components in the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) regime .",
    "this is first because the low - frequency wave is expected to have more power , and second because the resonance frequency of the proton is higher than those of heavier ions so that the energy of the ioncyclotron wave is in advance absorbed by the heavy ions @xcite .",
    "the treatment of the wave dissipation is quite complicated even for mhd processes .",
    "the main reason is that the nonlinearity becomes essential because amplitudes of upgoing waves are inevitably amplified in the stratified atmosphere with decreasing density .",
    "therefore , numerical simulation is a powerful tool ; there are several works on the wave propagation and dissipation in one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite and in two - dimensional @xcite simulations .",
    "however , large density contrast amounting more than 15 orders of magnitude from the photosphere to the outer heliosphere has prevented one so far from carrying out numerical simulation in a broad region from the photosphere to the interplanetary space even in 1d modeling .    in @xcite ( paper i hereafter )",
    "we successfully carried out 1d mhd simulation with radiative cooling and thermal conduction from the photosphere to 0.3 au .",
    "we showed that the coronal heating and the fast solar wind acceleration in the coronal hole are natural consequences of the transverse footpoint fluctuations of the magnetic field lines .",
    "low - frequency ( @xmath0hz ) waves are generated by the photospheric fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the sufficient amount of the energy transmits into the corona in spite of attenuation in the chromosphere and the transition region ( tr ) , so that they effectively dissipate to heat and accelerate the coronal plasma .",
    "although it is based on the one - fluid mhd approximation , it , for the first time , self - consistently treats the plasma heating and the propagation of the waves from the photosphere to the interplanetary space .",
    "however , we studied only one case for the fast solar wind in paper i. it is important to examine how properties of the corona and the solar wind are affected by adopting different types of the wave injections and/or different magnetic field geometry of the flux tubes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study parametrically the heating by the low - frequency waves .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the one - fluid mhd approximation in 1d flux tubes , which is the same as in paper i. this assumption is not strictly correct in the solar wind plasma , which will be discussed later (  [ sec : lmt ] ) .",
    "however , we think that the mhd approximation is appropriate for studies of the average properties of the plasma in the corona and the solar wind because the plasma particles are sufficiently randomized by the fluctuating magnetic fields .",
    "we consider 1d open flux tubes which are super - radially open , measured by heliocentric distance , @xmath14 .",
    "the simulation regions are from the photosphere ( @xmath15 ) with density , @xmath16 g @xmath17 , to @xmath18 ( 0.3au ) or @xmath19 ( @xmath80.1au ) , where @xmath20 is the solar radius . radial field strength , @xmath21 , is given by conservation of magnetic flux as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a super - radial expansion factor .",

    "the flux tube initially expands by a factor of @xmath27 around @xmath28 corresponding to the funnel structure @xcite , and followed by @xmath29 times expansion around @xmath30 due to the large scale dipole magnetic fields ( figure [ fig : flxdv ] ) .",
    "we define the total super - radial expansion as @xmath31 .",
    "we prescribe the transverse fluctuations of the field line by the granulations at the photosphere , which excite waves .",

    "we consider three types of spectrum : ( i ) @xmath35 ( ii ) @xmath36 ( white noise ) ( iii ) @xmath37 ( sinusoidal waves with a period of 180 seconds ) .",

    "each cell boundary is treated as discontinuity , and for the time evolution we solve nonlinear riemann shock tube problems with the magnetic pressure term by using the rankin - hugoniot relations .",
    "therefore , entropy generation , namely heating , is automatically calculated from the shock jump condition .",
    "a great advantage of our code is that no artificial viscosity is required even for strong mhd shocks ; numerical diffusion is suppressed to the minimum level for adopted numerical resolution .",

    "note that the real energy flux is larger ( smaller ) in @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) . while the most of the initial wave energy escapes by radiation loss in the chromosphere and the low corona , the remained energy , which is @xmath97 of the input , is transfered to the kinetic energy of the solar wind in the outer region .",
    "the thermal energy is almost constant in the corona , which indicates that the @xmath981mk plasma is maintained by the energy balance among wave heating , radiative cooling , adiabatic cooling ( solar wind acceleration ) , and redistribution by thermal conduction .",

    "i , we claimed that the dissipation of the low - frequency waves in the corona is mainly by the generation of slow waves and reflection of the waves due to the density fluctuation of the slow modes .",

    "one can clearly see the waves in @xmath103 and @xmath104 diagrams , which have the same slopes with the characteristics shown above .",
    "one can also find the incoming modes propagating from lower - right to upper - left as well as the outgoing modes generated from the surface and @xmath108 ( dark - dark or light - light in the figures ) , while the outgoing modes have the negative correlation ( dark - light or light - dark ) . ] .",
    "these incoming waves are generated by the reflection at the ` density mirrors ' of the slow modes ( see paper i ) . at intersection points of the outgoing and incoming characteristics",
    "the non - linear wave - wave interactions take place , which play a role in the wave dissipation .",
    "the slow modes are seen in @xmath71 and @xmath50 diagrams .",
    "although it might be difficult to distinguish , the most of the patterns are due to the outgoing slow modes and @xmath50 , ( @xmath109 ) , while the incoming modes have the negative correlation ( @xmath110 ) . ] which are generated from the perturbations of the wave pressure , @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "these slow waves steepen eventually and lead to the shock dissipation .",
    "the processes discussed here are the combination of the direct mode conversion to the compressive waves and the parametric decay instability due to three - wave ( outgoing , incoming , and outgoing slow waves ) interactions ( goldstein 1978 ; terasawa et al .",
    "1986 ; see also  [ sec : wpl ] ) of the waves .",
    "although they are not generally efficient in the homogeneous background since they are the nonlinear mechanisms , the density gradient of the background plasma totally changes the situation . owing to the gravity , the density rapidly decreases in the corona as @xmath14 increases , which results in the amplification of the wave amplitude so that the waves easily become nonlinear .",
    "furthermore , the speed varies a lot due to the change of the density even within one wavelength of waves with periods of minutes or longer .",
    "this leads to both variation of the wave pressure in one wavelength and partial reflection through the deformation of the wave shape @xcite .",
    "the dissipation is greatly enhanced by the density stratification , in comparison with the case of the homogeneous background .",
    "thus , the low - frequency waves are effectively dissipated , which results in the heating and acceleration of the coronal plasma .    in summary , we have shown that the low - frequency waves are dissipated via the combination of the direct mode conversion and the decay instability which are considerably enhanced by the long wavelength ( so called `` non - wkb '' ) effect in the stratified atmosphere .",
    "although each process is not individually effective enough , the significant dissipation rate is realized by the combination .",
    "we investigate how the properties of the corona and solar wind depend on the parameters of the input photospheric fluctuations and the flux tube geometry .",
    "we use smaller simulation boxes in run ii - ix than in run i ( table 1 ) to save the computational time for the parameter studies . in most cases",
    "quasi - steady state conditions are achieved after @xmath112hr . in this section",
    "we show results at @xmath113hr unless explicitly stated .",
    "we show dependences on the spectrum , @xmath33 , of the photospheric fluctuations .",
    "we here compare the results of @xmath114 ( @xmath115hz ; run ii ) , @xmath116(white noise ; run iii ) , and purely sinusoidal perturbation with a period of 180 s , @xmath117 ( run iv ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dpwsp1 ] shows structure of the coronae and solar winds .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : dpwsp2 ] plots an adiabatic constant , @xmath118 , of the outgoing wave derived from wave action @xcite : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is amplitude of the outgoing wave ( elssser variables ) .",
    "the lower panel shows nonlinearity , @xmath121 of the outgoing waves .",
    "figure [ fig : dpwsp1 ] shows that the plasma is heated up to the coronal temperature and accelerated to 400 - 600km / s at 0.1au in all the runs .",
    "particularly , the results of @xmath122 and @xmath116 are quite similar .",
    "the attenuation of the outgoing waves is due to the two kinds of the processes , the shocks and the reflection in our simulations .",
    "the shock dissipation per unit distance is larger for waves with larger @xmath123 because the number of shocks is proportional to wavenumber . on the other hand , waves with smaller",
    "@xmath123 suffer the reflection more since the wavelengths are relatively larger compared to the variation scale of the speed so that the wave shapes are deformed more .",
    "these two ingredients with respect to the @xmath123-dependence cancel in these two cases , and the variations of the energy and the amplitude become quite similar ( figure [ fig : dpwsp2 ] ) .",
    "the structures of the corona and the solar wind are also similar since they are consequences of the wave dissipation .",
    "the results of the purely sinusoidal fluctuation ( run iv ) are slightly different from the other two cases .",
    "the tr is not so sharp as those in the other two runs .",
    "the temperature firstly rises at @xmath124 , but drops slightly and again rises around @xmath125 .",
    "actually , the tr moves back and forth more compared to the other cases . this is because the shock heating takes place rather intermittently only at the wave crests of the monochromatic wave , while in the other cases the heating is distributed more uniformly by the contributions from waves with various @xmath123 s . as a result",
    ", the chromospheric evaporation occurs intermittently so that the tr becomes `` dynamical '' .",
    "the sharpness of the tr is important in terms of the wave reflection . in the sinusoidal case (",
    "run iv ) the waves becomes more transparent at the tr since the variation of the speed is more gradual .",
    "therefore , more wave energy transmits into the corona , avoiding the reflection at the tr ( figure [ fig : dpwsp2 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the temperature and density in the outer region become higher owing to the larger plasma heating ( figure [ fig : dpwsp1 ] ) .",
    "we examine the effect of the wave polarization .",
    "linearly polarized waves dissipate by the direct steepening @xcite to mhd fast shocks as well as by the parametric decay instability @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "circularly polarized components do not steepen , and it dissipates only by the parametric decay instability in our one - fluid mhd framework , so that the dissipation becomes less efficient .    figures [ fig : dpwpl1 ] and [ fig : dpwpl2 ] compare the results of sinusoidal linearly polarized ( run iv ) and circularly polarized ( run v ) fluctuations with the same amplitude ( @xmath126 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the results of run ii are also plotted for comparison .",
    "it is shown that the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are still achieved by the dissipation of the circularly polarized waves ( figure [ fig : dpwpl1 ] ) although a large fraction of the wave energy remains at the outer boundary ( figure [ fig : dpwpl2 ] ) owing to the less dissipative character as expected .    a key ingredient for the efficient dissipation is the rapid decrease of the density owing to the gravity as discussed in  [ sec : hawd ] .",
    "the circularly polarized waves which are initially sinusoidal are quickly deformed by the rapid variation of the density in the chromosphere and the low corona ; simple sinusoidal waves can not propagate any further unless the wavelengths are sufficiently short .",
    "the shape deformation indicates that the waves are partially reflected and the incoming waves are generated .",
    "compressive slow waves are also easily generated even without the steepening because the variation of the magnetic pressure is present owing to the large difference of the speed within one wavelength @xcite .",
    "it has been generally believed that the decay instability of the waves is not important in the context of the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration .",
    "however , our simulation shows that this is not the case ; the three - wave interactions are greatly enhanced by the long wavelength effect so that the sufficient wave dissipation occurs in the real solar corona .",
    "the case of the circularly polarized waves gives smaller coronal density and temperature since the wave dissipation is less effective .",
    "however , the solar wind speed is rather faster , up to 700 km s@xmath5 at 0.1au , because the less dense plasma can be efficiently accelerated by transfer from the momentum flux of the waves .",
    "we study dependences on the amplitudes of the input fluctuations at the photosphere .",
    "we compare the results of larger @xmath127 km s@xmath5 ( run vi ) and smaller @xmath128 km s@xmath5 ( run vii ) cases with the fiducial case ( @xmath129 km s@xmath5 ; run ii ) in figures [ fig : dpwam1 ] and [ fig : dpwam2 ] .",
    "we also show the results of @xmath130 km s@xmath5 ( run ix ) at @xmath131hr in figure [ fig : dpwam1 ] , although quasi steady - state behavior is not achieved . at later time in run ix , the density and temperature decrease with time as explained later .    the maximum temperature of run vii ( @xmath132 km s@xmath5 ) is @xmath133k , which is cooler than the usual corona .",
    "the density is much lower than the fiducial case by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude because the sufficient mass can not supply into the corona by the chromospheric evaporation owing to the low temperature ; the evaporation is drastically suppressed as @xmath72 decreases since the conductive flux ( @xmath134 ) sensitively depends on @xmath72 . as a result , the mass flux ( @xmath135 ) becomes more than an order of magnitude lower than that of the present solar wind .",
    "these tendencies are more extreme in run ix ; the coronal temperature and density become further low in run ix ; @xmath136k and the density in the corona and solar wind is smaller by 3 orders of magnitude than the fiducial case .",
    "this behavior can be understood by the wave dissipation ( figure [ fig : dpwam2 ] ) .",
    "the input wave energy ( @xmath137 ) in run vii is 1/3 of that of run ii .",
    "however , the upper panel of figure [ fig : dpwam2 ] shows that the remained @xmath138 s in both cases are similar at 0.1au , which indicates that the waves do not effectively dissipate in the smaller @xmath6 case .",
    "this is because the speed ( @xmath139 ) is larger due to the lower density and the nonlinearity , @xmath140 , becomes weaker . as a result ,",
    "the final energy flux of the solar wind at 0.1au , mostly consisting of the kinetic energy ( @xmath141 ) , becomes one order of magnitude smaller although the ratio of the input wave energy is only 1/3 .",
    "once the coronal density starts to decrease , a positive feedback operates .",
    "namely , the decrease of the density leads to weaker non - linearity of the waves , which reduces the plasma heating by the wave dissipation .",
    "this decreases the coronal temperature , and further reduces the coronal density by the suppression of the chromospheric evaporation .",
    "this takes place in run ix ( @xmath142 km s@xmath5 ) so that the coronal density and temperature continue to decrease at later time , instead of maintaining steady corona and solar wind .",
    "our results show that @xmath143 km s@xmath5 is the criterion of the photospheric fluctuations for the formation of the stable hot plasma . to get the maximum coronal temperature @xmath3k ,",
    "@xmath144 km s@xmath5 is required .",
    "otherwise if @xmath145 km s@xmath5 , the low - frequency waves can not maintain the hot corona , and the solar wind mass flux becomes drastically small ; solar winds _ virtually disappear _ ( see  [ sec : dspsl ] ) .",
    "the solar wind speeds are slightly faster in the cases of smaller @xmath6 ( accordingly smaller energy input ) , because the densities at the coronal bases are much smaller owing to the suppression of the chromospheric evaporation ; the smaller amounts of the materials are accelerated to the faster speeds .",
    "the differences between the photospheric and coronal base densities are larger in the smaller @xmath6 cases and the amplification of @xmath146 ( @xmath147 if waves are nondissipative in static media ; e.g. lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) is larger . as a result ,",
    "@xmath73 at the coronal base is ( weakly ) anti - correlated with @xmath6 at the photosphere .",
    "thus , our result is consistent with the previous calculations @xcite that show the positively correlation between the wave amplitude at the coronal base and the solar wind speed .",
    "larger @xmath6 gives larger coronal density as shown in run vi .",
    "the initial increase of the temperature starts from a deeper location around @xmath148 than the other cases .",
    "thanks to this , a decrease of the density is slower ( larger pressure scale height ) so that the density around @xmath149 is two orders of magnitude larger than that of run ii .",
    "however , the temperature decreases slightly instead of a monotonical increase ; it can not go over the peak of the radiative cooling function at @xmath150k @xcite because the radiative loss is efficient owing to the large density .",
    "the second increase of the temperature begins from @xmath151 and above there the corona is formed .",
    "the coronal density and temperature are larger than those in run ii .",
    "in particular the density in the outer region is 10 times larger , and the mass flux of the solar wind is larger by the same extent .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : dpwam2 ] shows that the waves dissipate more effectively in the larger @xmath6 case by the same mechanism as explained above for the smaller @xmath152 cases .",
    "figure [ fig : dpwam3 ] summarizes the maximum coronal temperature , @xmath153(k ) ( top ) , the solar wind mass flux at 0.1au , @xmath154(g @xmath155s@xmath5 ) ( middle ) , and solar wind speed at 0.1au , @xmath156(km s@xmath5 ) , ( bottom ) as functions of @xmath157(km s@xmath5 ) . on the right axis of the middle panel ,",

    "we only consider the steady fluctuations with constant @xmath6 s to study the basic relation between the footpoint fluctuations and the properties of the solar winds . in the real situation , however , @xmath6 would vary in time .",
    "our results imply that a small temporal variation of @xmath11 at the surface possibly leads to large time dependent behavior of the solar wind .",
    "as one example we would like to discuss an event of solar wind disappearance in the following section",
    ".      on may 10 - 12 , 1999 , observed solar wind density near the earth drastically decreases well below 1 @xmath17 for @xmath98 a day and to 0.1 @xmath17 at the lowest level , in comparison with the typical value @xmath162 @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms are widely discussed to explain this disappearance event @xcite . in  [ sec : dvdpn ] , we have shown that the solar wind density sensitively depends on the amplitude of the photospheric fluctuation provided that the nonlinear dissipation of low - frequency waves operates in the solar wind heating and acceleration . according to figure [ fig : dpwam3 ]",
    "the solar wind density and mass flux becomes @xmath163 and @xmath164 times smaller respectively if @xmath157 changes from 0.7 km s@xmath5 to 0.4 km s@xmath5 ; a small variance of the energy injection at the solar surface leads to a large variation of the solar wind density because of the nonlinearity .",
    "therefore , we can infer that if the amplitude of the photospheric turbulence becomes @xmath98 1/2 during @xmath98a day , this event of the solar wind disappearance is possibly realized .",
    "the observation shows that the velocity of the sparse plasma discussed above is lower than that of the surrounding plasma , which is inconsistent with our results (  [ sec : dvdpn ] ) .",
    "we are speculating that the stream interaction would resolve the inconsistency .",
    "the sparse region is easily blocked by the preceding dense plasma in the spiral magnetic fields ( parker spiral ) even if its speed in the inner region ( say @xmath165au ) is faster @xcite , because the ram pressure is much smaller than that of the surrounding plasma . for quantitative arguments , however , two dimensional modeling is required .",
    "it is widely believed that field strength and geometry of open flux tubes are important parameters that control the solar wind speed .",
    "@xcite showed that the solar wind speed at @xmath98 1au is anti - correlated with @xmath2 from their long - term observations as well as by a simple theoretical model .",
    "@xcite showed this tendency by time - dependent simulations as well .",
    "@xcite claimed that the wind speed should be positively correlated with @xmath1 by a simple energetics consideration . @xcite",
    "have found that the solar wind velocity is better correlated with the combination of these two parameters , @xmath10 , than @xmath166 or @xmath1 from the comparison of the outflow speed obtained by their interplanetary scintillation measurements with observed photospheric field strength . @xcite and @xcite also pointed out that @xmath10 should be the best control parameter provided that the waves play a dominate role in the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration .    here",
    "we test the last scenario by our simulation . in figures [ fig : dpbf1 ] and [ fig : dpbf2 ] , we compare the results of a flux tube with smaller @xmath167 ( run viii ) with the fiducial case ( @xmath168 ) ( run ii ) for the polar coronal hole .",
    "we chose the parameters of run viii with equatorial and mid - latitude coronal holes in mind ; they are surrounded by closed structures , and thus , have moderately larger photospheric field strength and much larger flux tube divergence than the polar coronal hole .",
    "figure [ fig : dpbf1 ] shows that run viii gives much slower solar wind speed which is consistent with @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , with slightly hotter and denser corona .",
    "these results can be understood by positions of the wave dissipation .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : dpbf2 ] indicates that the outgoing waves dissipate more rapidly in the smaller @xmath10 case .",
    "this is because the nonlinearity of the waves , @xmath169 is larger due to smaller @xmath170(@xmath171 in the outer region where the flux tube is already super - radially open ) even though the absolute amplitude ( @xmath172 ) is smaller ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : dpbf1 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "more wave energy dissipate in the smaller @xmath10 case in the subsonic region and less energy remains in the supersonic region .",
    "in general , energy and momentum inputs in the supersonic region gives higher wind speed , while those in the subsonic region raises the mass flux ( @xmath135 ) of the wind by an increase of the density @xcite .",
    "therefore , the smaller @xmath10 case gives slower wind with higher coronal density , whereas the solar wind density in the outer region is similar to that of the larger @xmath10 case on account of the dilution of the plasma in the more rapidly expanding flux tube .",
    "we can conclude that @xmath10 controls the solar wind speed and the coronal density through the nonlinear dissipation of the waves .",
    "we have examined the dependences of the coronal and wind properties on the various wave and flux tube parameters in  [ sec : viw ] and  [ sec : flxtp ] .",
    "one of the important results is that we do not find any subsonic breeze solution in our simulations .",
    "all the runs with @xmath173 km s@xmath5 show the transonic feature , hence , transonic solar winds are natural consequences of the dissipation of the low - frequency waves .",
    "smaller energy injection only reduces the density ( and consequently the mass flux ) of the wind .",
    "the wind speed itself is rather slightly faster for smaller wave energy because the coronal base density becomes lower owing to the suppression of the chromospheric evaporation .    from  [ sec :",
    "wsp ] and  [ sec : wpl ] , we can conclude that the dependences on the spectra and polarizations of the input fluctuations are weak as long as the low - frequency ( @xmath0hz ) waves are considered .",
    "@xmath157 and @xmath10 are the important control parameters , and the dependences are summarized below :    * the coronal temperature and the density in the corona and solar wind are mainly determined by the photospheric amplitude , @xmath157 .",
    "the corona with temperature @xmath3k is formed if @xmath174 km s@xmath5 .",
    "larger @xmath157 gives higher density in the corona and the solar wind .",
    "if @xmath175 km s@xmath5 the hot plasma can not be maintained and the mass flux of the solar wind is unrealistically small . *",
    "the solar wind speed is mainly controlled by @xmath10 ; faster winds come from open flux tubes with larger @xmath10 .",
    "the observed solar winds can be categorized into two distinctive types .",
    "one is the fast solar wind which is mainly from polar coronal holes and the other is the slow wind which is from mid- to low - latitude regions . apart from the velocity difference , both density of solar winds @xcite and freezing - in temperatures of heavy ions @xcite which reflect the coronal temperatures are anti - correlated with velocities .",
    "origins of the slow solar wind are still in debate ; there are mainly two types argued ( see wang et al.2000 for review ) .",
    "one is the acceleration due to intermittent break - ups of the cusp - shaped closed fields in the equatorial region ( e.g. endeve , leer , & holtzer 2003 ) .",
    "the other is the acceleration in open flux tubes with large areal expansions in low- and mid - latitude regions .",
    "@xcite detected low - speed winds with single magnetic polarities , originating from open structure regions located near active regions , which indicates a certain fraction of the slow stream is coming from open regions , similarly to the fast wind . in this paper",
    "we focus on the latter case with respect to the slow solar wind .    based on our parameter studies summarized in  [ sec : smps ] , we can infer the suitable @xmath157 and @xmath10 for the slow solar wind by comparing with those for the fast wind ( run i / ii ; also in paper i ) ; the slow wind requires larger @xmath157 and smaller @xmath10 than the fast wind .",
    "the adopted parameters are summarized in table 1 ( run x ) . in the panels on the left side of figure [ fig : fwsw ]",
    "we compare the results of run x ( slow wind ) and run i ( fast wind ) overlayed with recent observations of slow solar winds ( see figure [ fig : obscmp ] for the observations of fast winds ) .",
    "the temperature and density of the slow wind case becomes larger on account of the larger @xmath157 , which explains the observations .",
    "on the other hand , smaller @xmath176 gives slower terminal speed . as a result ,",
    "the observed anti - correlation of the wind speed and the coronal temperature @xcite is well - explained by our simulations . in the slow wind case ( run x ) , the acceleration of the outflow is more gradual , and it is not negligible in @xmath177 ( e.g. nakagawa et al.2005 ) .    in the panels on the right of figure [ fig : fwsw ] ,",
    "we show the properties of the wave dissipation .",
    "the top right panel compares transverse amplitude , @xmath73 , averaged over 28 minutes in the fast and slow wind cases .",
    "@xmath73 is larger in the fast wind .",
    "this is because the waves become less dissipative in the fast wind conditions ; larger @xmath178 and smaller @xmath50 give larger @xmath179 so that the nonlinearity of the waves , @xmath180 , is systematically smaller . as a result , the wave dissipates more slowly in the fast wind case , which is shown in the plot of @xmath138 of the wave ( the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : fwsw ] ) .",
    "this tendency of the larger @xmath73 in the fast wind is expected to continue to the outer region , @xmath181 .",
    "various in situ observations in the solar wind plasma near the earth also show that the fast wind contains more wave components ( see tsurutani & ho 1999 for review ) , which can be explained via the nonlinear dissipation of waves based on our simulations .",
    "the middle right panel of figure [ fig : fwsw ] shows longitudinal fluctuation , @xmath182 , averaged over 28 minutes .",
    "@xmath182 reflects the amplitude of slow mhd waves generated from the waves via the nonlinear process (  [ sec : hawd ] ) .",
    "slow waves are identified in polar regions @xcite and low - latitude regions @xcite at low altitudes ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the observed amplitudes are still small ( @xmath184 km s@xmath5 in the polar regions and @xmath185 km @xmath5 in the low - latitude regions ) because of the large density there , which is consistent with our results . what is more interesting is longitudinal fluctuations in outer regions .",
    "our results exhibits that @xmath186 in the solar wind plasma is not small .",
    "typically , the simulations give @xmath187km / s in @xmath188 of the fast wind and @xmath189km / s in @xmath190 of the slow wind , whereas these might be modified if we take into account multi - dimensional effects (  [ sec : lmt ] ) .",
    "this is directly testable by in situ measurements of future missions , solar orbiter and solar probe , which will approach to @xmath9845 and 4 @xmath20 , respectively , corresponding to the inside of our computation domain .",
    "our simulations show that the different types of the solar winds can be explained by the single process , the dissipation of the low - frequency waves , although we do not intend to exclude other possibilities .",
    "the varieties of the solar winds are due to the varieties of the footpoint amplitudes as well as the magnetic fields and geometry of the flux tubes .",
    "our choice of @xmath10 is consistent with the obtained data by @xcite who report that the slow winds are mainly from the low - to mid - latitude coronal holes with smaller @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , quantitative arguments on @xmath6 need more detailed fine scale observations of the magnetic fields with high cadence by future telescopes such as solar - b .",
    "in this paper we have assumed that the origin of the waves is the steady turbulent motions at the photosphere .",
    "however , transient activities are also expected to play a role in the wave generation .",
    "@xcite proposed small flare - like events triggered by magnetic reconnections of closed loops in the chromosphere excite mhd waves in the corona .",
    "@xcite also show that interactions between open field lines and emergent flux tubes excite waves at a location above the photosphere . these waves",
    "could directly heat up the corona since they do not suffer the attenuation in the chromosphere and the tr .",
    "an important issue for the wave generation by these transient events is the energetics .",
    "the energy release from each event is generally thought to be small , categorized as a micro- or nano - flare @xcite . to clarify how these waves dominantly work in the heating and acceleration of the solar wind",
    ", we should determine the frequency of these events .",
    "these small - scale events might be important in the heating of not only the open coronal holes but the closed regions .",
    "the determination of the total energy release from small transient events by future observations is quite important in terms of the coronal heating in various portions of the corona .",
    "we have shown by the self - consistent simulations that the dissipation of the low - frequency waves through the generation of the compressive waves and shocks is one of the solutions for the heating and acceleration of the plasma in the coronal holes .",
    "however , the validity of the 1d mhd approximation needs to be examined .",
    "we think that the mhd approximation is appropriate as a whole for studies of the average properties of the plasma .",
    "let us estimate the larmor radius , @xmath191 , of the protons which compose the main part of the plasma due to fluctuations of field lines , @xmath108 , under the coronal condition .",
    "typically , @xmath192 g , and then @xmath193 km for a thermal proton with @xmath163 km s@xmath5 . on the other hand the shortest wavelength , @xmath194 , of the waves we are considering is @xmath195 km ( a period of 20s and @xmath196 km s@xmath5 . ) and the simulation grid size in the corona is @xmath197 km ( @xmath198 of @xmath194 ) ; the thermal protons are supposed to be well randomized through turbulent magnetic fields on the scales we are dealing with . in our simulations the heating of the plasma is done by mhd shocks (  [ sec : stup ] ) .",
    "our simulations can not resolve detailed structures of shocks since the size of the grid is larger than the width of the shock front which is an order of a larmor radius .",
    "however , the global structure of shocks can be appropriately treated by our simulations .",
    "the thermal particles could be ` trapped ' around the shock regions by the random magnetic fields so that the global properties of shocks would satisfy the mhd condition .",
    "therefore , the shock heating rate calculated in our mhd simulations is supposed to give a reasonable estimate in the coronal region . in the outer region ( @xmath199 ) , @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) increases and @xmath194 ( @xmath202 ) decreases as @xmath14 increases . even around @xmath203au , @xmath191 is about @xmath981/10 of @xmath194 ; the approximation still remains reasonable .",
    "however , we should be cautious about the fact that the shocks are collisionless ; mean free path due to coulomb collisions , which is @xmath163 km for electron - electron collisions and even larger for electron - proton and proton - proton collisions under the typical coronal condition ( @xmath204k and @xmath205@xmath17 ) , is much larger than @xmath191 so that the particles are not thermalized by coulomb collisions but only randomized by fluctuating fields .",
    "in such a condition , the particle distribution function possibly deviates from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which is actually observed in solar wind plasma @xcite .",
    "non - thermal , or even supra - thermal , particles might modify the heating rate , if their amount is not negligible .",
    "the shock energy is transfered not only to the thermal heating but also to acceleration of the nonthermal component .",
    "although this is beyond the scope of the present paper , this issue should be carefully considered in more detailed models .",
    "effects of multi - component plasma also need to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the thermal conduction and radiative cooling are mainly involved with electrons , and the electron temperature becomes systematically lower than the ion temperature without effective thermal coupling by coulomb collisions .",
    "the observed proton temperature is actually higher than the electron temperature even around a few solar radii @xcite .",
    "the temperature in our simulations represents the electron temperature because it is mainly determined by the thermal conduction and radiative cooling .",
    "the actual thermal pressure is supposed to be higher than the simulated temperature due to the higher proton temperature .",
    "therefore , the acceleration profile might be slightly modified whereas the the dynamics are mostly controlled by the magnetic pressure of the waves .",
    "collisionless processes would also be important for the wave dissipation @xcite .",
    "the heating rates by the dissipation of waves are different for electrons and ions @xcite .",
    "the compressive waves generated from the waves would suffer transit - time damping by interactions between magnetic mirrors and surfing particles @xcite . if high - frequency ( ioncyclotron ) waves are produced by frequency cascade ,",
    "the heating sensitively depends on mass - to - charge ratios of particles @xcite .",
    "it is believed that this process can explain the observed preferential heating of the perpendicular temperature of the heavy ions @xcite , while there are potential difficulties in the proton heating as discussed in  [ sec : int ] .    in the chromosphere ,",
    "the gas is not fully ionized .",
    "in such circumstances , the friction due to ion - neutral collisions might be important in the dissipation of waves @xcite .",
    "generally , the shock dissipation tends to be overestimated in 1d simulations because the waves can not be diluted by the geometrical expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "there are other mechanisms of the wave damping due to the multi - dimensionality @xcite , such as phase mixing @xcite and refraction @xcite . moreover , the solar wind plasma is more or less turbulent and it must be important to take into account the plasma heating through cascades of turbulences in the transverse direction @xcite .",
    "studies of the imbalanced cascade , in which a wave component in one direction has larger energy than that in the counter direction , seem to be important for us to understand transport phenomena in the solar wind plasma @xcite , though it has not been fully understood yet .    therefore , the waves might also be dissipated by mechanisms different from those included in our simulations",
    ". accordingly , variation of wave amplitudes might be modified when these additional dissipation processes are considered .",
    "self - consistent simulations including these various processes remain to be done in order to arrive at final conclusion .",
    "we have performed parametric studies of the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration by the low - frequency waves in open coronal holes . we have performed 1d mhd numerical simulations from the photosphere to 0.3 or 0.1au .",
    "the low - frequency waves with various spectra , polarization , and amplitude are generated by the footpoint fluctuations of the magnetic field lines .",
    "we have treated the wave propagation and dissipation , and the heating and acceleration of the plasma in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we have found that the transonic solar winds are accomplished in all the simulation runs .",
    "smaller energy injection does not reduce the outflow speed but the density to maintain the transonic feature .",
    "the atmosphere is heated up to the coronal temperature ( @xmath3k ) if the photospheric amplitude , @xmath4 km s@xmath5 .",
    "otherwise , the temperature and density become much lower than the present coronal values .",
    "if @xmath206 km s@xmath5 , the temperature becomes less than a few @xmath207k and the sufficient mass can not be supplied into the corona owing to the suppression of the chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the stable hot corona can not be maintained any longer , and the mass flux of the solar wind becomes at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value of the present solar wind .",
    "this shows that the solar wind almost disappears only by reducing the photospheric fluctuation amplitude by half . on the other hand , the case with @xmath208 km s@xmath5 gives 10 times larger density than the fiducial case ( @xmath129 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "these sensitive behaviors of the solar wind mass flux on @xmath6 can be explained via the nonlinear dissipation of waves .",
    "our simulations have also confirmed that the positive correlation of the solar wind speed with @xmath10 obtained by @xcite .",
    "we have finally pointed out that both fast and slow solar winds can be explained even solely by the dissipation of the low - frequency waves with different @xmath157 and @xmath10 , whereas we do not intend to exclude other possibilities .",
    "fast winds are from flux tubes with larger @xmath10 and smaller @xmath157 , while slow winds are from flux tubes with smaller @xmath10 and larger @xmath152 .",
    "these choices naturally explain the following observed tendencies : ( i ) the anti - correlation of the solar wind speed and the coronal temperature , and ( ii ) the larger amplitude of waves in the fast wind in the interplanetary space .",
    "the tendency with respect to @xmath10 is consistent with the observed trend @xcite . to determine @xmath152 in various coronal holes ,",
