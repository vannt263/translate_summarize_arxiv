    "to characterize the resonances of the microring device in the @xmath26 nm band , two tunable lasers covering wavelength ranges from @xmath114 nm to @xmath115 nm and @xmath116 nm to @xmath117 nm are employed .",
    "figure [ fig_trans]a shows the measured transmission ( defined as the power collected by the lens fiber from the waveguide output normalized by the power sent to the lens fiber that couples to the waveguide input ) . as can be seen , even though the microring is multimode , only the fundamental te mode is observed in the transmission spectrum , thanks to the pulley coupling design  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_trans]b shows the transmission scan of the resonance around @xmath26 nm . at low powers , the resonance shape is close to lorentzian ; as the power increases , thermo - optic dispersion quickly results in the swept - wavelength lineshape following the commonly observed thermal triangle .",
    "figure [ fig_trans]c shows the transmission of the @xmath20 nm band , whose characterization involves three tunable lasers .",
    "the first two lasers , which have been used as the signal in the downconversion experiment ( fig .",
    "6a in the main paper ) , cover wavelength ranges from @xmath118 nm to @xmath119 nm and @xmath120 nm to @xmath121 nm .",
    "the third laser , which has been used as the @xmath20 nm pump for the wideband conversion experiment , has a tunable wavelength range from @xmath122 nm to @xmath123 nm and a relatively large output power ( @xmath124 mw ) . considering @xmath125 db coupling loss at the input facet , the maximum on - chip pump power is limited to @xmath126 mw .",
    "similar to the @xmath26 nm spectrum , the transmission of the @xmath20 nm band shows that only the fundamental te mode is well - coupled while other modes are suppressed .",
    "however , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig_trans]d , the fundamental te mode can interact with some other mode at certain wavelengths , which shifts its resonance frequency as shown in fig .",
    "2f in the main paper .",
    "by changing the polarization state of the input light , we find we can increase the extinction ratio of the mode that couples to the te resonance , suggesting this mode has a different polarization . through a careful phase - matching analysis , we believe the mode is most likely to be the fundamental tm mode .",
    "such excitation is possible because the te waveguide mode has a nonzero field overlap with the tm mode of the resonator , though generally the coupling is weak and only strong at certain wavelengths due to an accidental phase matching .",
    "the experimental setup for the @xmath26 nm to @xmath20 nm upconversion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_upconv]a , where a @xmath26 nm laser is amplified by the edfa ( pump ) , combined with another @xmath26 nm laser ( signal ) , and then combined with the @xmath20 nm pump before being coupled to the frequency conversion chip .",
    "figure [ fig_upconv]b shows some representative osa spectra in the @xmath20 nm band as we vary the spectral separation between the signal and the @xmath26 nm pump , while keeping the pump configuration the same as the example shown in fig .",
    "5b in the main paper ( which corresponds to @xmath84 fsr separation ) . by examining eq .",
    "[ eq_upphia2 ] ( effective detuning of @xmath14 in upconversion ) and eq .",
    "[ eq_downphic ] ( effective detuning of @xmath14 in downconversion ) , we find the frequency detuning of @xmath14 is essentially the same for the upconversion and downconversion schemes ( except that the sign is opposite ) , suggesting similar performance for @xmath14 between the two cases in terms of conversion efficiency and bandwidth .",
    "this is confirmed by comparing the experimental data to the simulation results based on the coupled mode equations as discussed in section i.b ( fig .",
    "[ fig_upconv]c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency detuning for @xmath15 ( eq .  [ eq_upphib2 ] ) is significantly different from the downconversion case ( eq .  [ eq_downphid ] ) , which seems to indicate that @xmath15 should have similar conversion efficiencies as @xmath14 even for reasonably large @xmath38 values .",
    "however , the measured conversion efficiencies are much worse than the simulation results ( fig .",
    "[ fig_upconv]c ) . the discrepancy can be attributed to several factors .",
    "first , some resonances accommodating @xmath15 have been shifted in the spectrum by mode interactions ( such as @xmath127 , see fig .",
    "2f in the main paper ) , which cause large frequency detunings that are not accounted for in the simulation .",
    "second , the transmission at certain resonances ( such as @xmath128 , see fig .  [",
    "fig_trans]c ) is much worse than other resonances , possibly due to some resonant scattering from defects along the waveguide or on the cleaved facets , leading to less power in the transmitted idlers .",
    "finally , the frequency detuning of the two pumps can drift during the experiment , which impacts the two idlers in a different way .",
    "the @xmath26 nm pump is always blue detuned ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) , since otherwise the thermal lock will be lost and no conversion efficiency will be observed . on the other hand , the @xmath20",
    "nm pump exhibits a lorentzian transmission scan due to the fact that its power is much smaller compared to the @xmath26 nm pump .",
    "though in the experiment we try to set @xmath130 by parking the laser to its minimum of transmission , it has been observed that the @xmath20 nm pump can often drift away from the initial position within a relatively short time . as can be seen from the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_upconv]d , @xmath15 is much more sensitive to the pump detunings than @xmath14 for the device under study , especially to the detuning of the @xmath20 nm pump .",
    "the experimental setup for the @xmath20 nm to @xmath26 nm downconversion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_downconv]a , where we have added a narrowband filter ( bandwidth @xmath45 100 ghz ) after the edfa to remove the ase noise . in addition , cascaded wdm filters have been used at the detection side to reject the @xmath26 nm pump ( @xmath131 db suppression ) while allowing idlers to pass with a small insertion loss ( @xmath132 db ) .",
    "the transmitted idlers are bandpassed by a narrowband filter with a tunable bandwidth ( @xmath99 pm to @xmath72 pm , , see fig .",
    "[ fig_noise]b for its transmission response ) and center wavelength ( @xmath100 nm to @xmath101 nm ) before detection by a spad .",
    "figure [ fig_downconv ] shows the osa spectra by varying the @xmath26 nm pump power while keeping the @xmath20 pump power fixed .",
    "( the pump and signal configuration is the same as the example shown in fig .",
    "5d in the main paper . )",
    "as can be seen , the extinction ratio of the signal resonance increases with the @xmath26 nm pump power ( left figure ) , while the generated idler @xmath14 increases initially and then saturates ( right figure ) .",
    "the summarized conversion efficiency of @xmath14 versus the @xmath26 nm pump power shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_downconv]c indicates the conversion efficiency scales linearly with the @xmath26 nm pump power , which is expected as the the conversion efficiency is determined by the product of two pump powers ( see eq .  [ eq_mw ] )  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we provide additional data on the background noise measurements performed in this work .",
    "figure [ fig_noise]a shows the measured transmission response ( blue curve ) of the tunable bandpass filter used in the noise measurement for the @xmath20 nm intraband conversion ( fig .",
    "4e in the main paper ) , which consists of a @xmath20 nm bandpass filter with a tunable center wavelength from @xmath133 nm to @xmath121 nm and a fixed bandwidth of @xmath77 nm , and a longpass filter which suppresses light below @xmath118 nm ( @xmath59 db insertion loss to light with wavelengths @xmath134 nm ) . it is found that when the @xmath26 nm pumps are on resonance , the measured noise by the spad can increase significantly ( more than tenfold increase ) if we remove the @xmath118 nm longpass filter , indicating the majority of the noise is below the wavelength of @xmath118 nm . inspecting the @xmath20 nm bandpass filter with a supercontinuum white light source and an osa reveals that the bandpass filter has a wide passband below @xmath135 nm ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_noise]a ) , suggesting the excessive noise ( without the @xmath118 nm longpass ) is likely to have wavelengths below @xmath135 nm . the investigation of its exact nature is the subject of future study .",
    "figure [ fig_noise]b shows the transmission responses of the narrowband filter used for the noise measurement in the frequency downconversion experiment ( figs .",
    "6c and 6d in the main paper ) , which is used to bandpass filter the downconverted idler in the @xmath26 nm band before the detection by a spad .",
    "the filter has a tunable bandwidth of @xmath99 pm to @xmath72 pm ( although below @xmath136 pm the insertion loss starts to increase ) , and a tunable center wavelength from @xmath100 nm to @xmath101 nm .",
    "as mentioned in the main paper , when the @xmath26 nm pump is off resonance , we find a broadband noise that scales with the detection bandwidth and is linearly dependent on the pump power .",
    "moreover , the measured noise is almost the same if we remove the chip and introduce a similar insertion loss between the two lensed fibers , strongly suggesting the noise is from the fiber itself .",
    "figure [ fig_noise]c measures the noise at a fixed frequency shift ( @xmath137 thz ) from the pump at the input side ( no chip ) , showing that the measured noise is linearly proportional to the pump power in the fiber ( left figure ) and increased fiber length for a fixed pump power ( right figure ) . the extracted ratio of the increased noise power with the fiber length ( @xmath138 pw / m ) is consistent with the anti - stokes raman signal for a pump power of @xmath139 mw with a detection bandwidth of @xmath136 ghz  @xcite . to further support this argument",

    "[ fig_noise]d ( markers ) as a function of the frequency shift , and compare it to the spontaneous anti - stokes raman spectrum ( blue line , multiplied by a factor to match its peak power to that of the pump - off - resonance noise ) .",

    "<S> therefore , it is necessary to tune the two pump lasers in an interactive and iterative way until both are thermally locked on their respective resonances .    </S>",

    "<S> if we further increase the pump power ( case iv ) , more sidebands are observed in both the @xmath26 nm and @xmath20 nm bands , but the conversion efficiency for @xmath14 and @xmath15 slightly decreases , indicating there is a saturation level for a specific idler . </S>",
    "<S> the osa data is complemented by transmission measurements in the @xmath20 nm band ( third column ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we use a narrowband filter ( centered on the signal resonance with bandwidth @xmath64 nm ) to reject all of the generated idlers and provide a measurement of the signal transmission . as the pump power increases </S>",
    "<S> , the signal resonance evolves from overcoupled ( cases i and ii ) to critically coupled ( case iii ) and then undercoupled ( case iv ) , indicating an increased intrinsic loss that is attributed to signal depletion due to the frequency conversion process . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , mode splitting starts to appear as the pump power increases , a phenomenon expected when there is a strong coupling between the signal and adjacent idlers ( see next section and also supplementary section i.a ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , we remove the narrowband filter and directly detect light in the whole @xmath20 nm band . at low pump powers </S>",
    "<S> ( cases i and ii ) , the transmission scan is the same as the linear case , but when the conversion efficiency is high ( cases iii and iv ) , the extinction ratio becomes much smaller , suggesting a significant amount of idler generation when the signal is on - resonance . </S>",

    "<S> thus , in this configuration , frequency conversion with a signal translation as low as @xmath66 nm ( 1 fsr ) and as large as @xmath67 nm ( 5 fsr ) can be achieved with an efficiency as high as @xmath68 in each first - order idler .        </S>",
    "<S> * numerical simulations * four - wave mixing in @xmath11 resonators can be described by the lugiato - lefever equation ( lle ) , a version of the nonlinear schrodinger equation that includes driving and dissipation and which has been successfully applied to study microcavity frequency combs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to understand our experimental results , numerical simulations based on a modified form of the conventional lle formalism are carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the modification is needed for fwm - bs to allow for three independent inputs ( i.e. , two pumps and one signal ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , coupled mode equations are also used  @xcite . though the two approaches are essentially equivalent  @xcite , they differ in detailed forms and numerical implementation , which may render one better than the other depending on the scope of the problem . for example , the coupled mode equations are usually preferred for revealing the underlying physics , while the lle method is capable of capturing all relevant physical mechanisms by automatically including a complete set of modes into simulation .    figure 4a shows the simulation results based on the modified lle method ( see methods ) for the case of @xmath61 mw power per pump . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the corresponding experimental results ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b case iii ) , we find the modified lle simulation successfully models the pump mixing in the @xmath26 nm band and the multiple idler generation in the @xmath20 nm band ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is a small noise band in the anomalous dispersion region ( @xmath69 nm to @xmath70 nm ) , which arises from modulation instability processes ( i.e. , one photon from the @xmath20 nm signal and one photon from the @xmath26 nm pumps are converted to nearly degenerate photon pairs near the wavelength of @xmath71 nm ) , though such processes are generally frequency - mismatched and small enough to be neglected . </S>",

    "<S> 4c , left ) also shows good agreement with the experimental data , and the observed mode splitting is explained by a simplified set of coupled mode equations to result from strong couplings induced by fwm - bs between the signal and its adjacent idlers ( supplementary section i.a ) . </S>",
    "<S> generally , increasing pump powers leads to larger mode splitting and increased conversion bandwidth for the signal photon ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c , right ) , but not necessarily higher conversion efficiency for a specific idler as its conversion efficiency will eventually saturate .    </S>",
    "<S> * snr measurement * along with conversion efficiency , a key metric for quantum photonic applications ( as well as some classical applications ) is the background noise generated in the converted idler band . in general </S>",
    "<S> , one may expect that noise to originate due to the presence of strong pump fields , which through processes such as raman scattering , may generate photons that are either directly resonant with the converted idler , or are resonant with the input signal and get frequency converted together with it . </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of the scheme presented here is that the signal and idler are about @xmath72 nm away from the strong pump fields ( and are on their anti - stokes side ) , suggesting that noise due to raman scattering should be limited .        to determine the suitability of this system as a qfc interface </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the conversion efficiency and snr for an input signal at the single photon level ( @xmath59  pw , corresponding to photon flux @xmath73 s@xmath74 , which is consistent with the photon flux produced by systems such as a quantum dot single photon source  @xcite triggered at @xmath75 mhz and with a source efficiency of @xmath76 ) . a single - photon avalanche diode ( spad ) is used to measure the power in the converted idler band , which is spectrally isolated from the @xmath26 nm pumps using a wdm and a @xmath77 nm bandwidth bandpass filter ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the on - chip conversion efficiency , background noise power , and snr are determined from knowledge of the coupling loss and insertion losses of the filtering elements . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d , the on - chip conversion efficiency as a function of pump power for the @xmath14 idler agrees with the lle simulation , and peaks at @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> we next measure the noise power by turning off the input signal and considering two cases , when the pumps are on - resonance with their respective cavity modes and when they are off - resonance ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4e ) . </S>",
    "<S> off resonance , any measured noise is found to be broadband emission from the erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) used for the pump , and can be significantly reduced by filtering at the input side , prior to the chip ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a , wdm filter placed after the edfa ) . on resonance , we observe noise above the edfa - determined background , at the level of a few fw . </S>",
    "<S> this noise is mainly contributed by the si@xmath4n@xmath5 microresonator , though its origin is still under investigation ( see supplementary section vi ) . at the optimum conversion efficiency ( @xmath68 at pump power @xmath79 mw ) , </S>",
    "<S> the snr is larger than @xmath80 for the aforementioned input signal photon flux @xmath73 s@xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for triggered sources , we only need to consider generated noise that temporally coincides with the single photon emission , which is produced at well defined times ( the triggering times ) and over well defined intervals ( the spontaneous emission lifetime ; typically @xmath45  1  ns for an inas / gaas quantum dot  @xcite ) . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> either gated detection or temporal gating of the signal via amplitude modulation  @xcite can be used , with a typical duty cycle of @xmath81 ( for a @xmath75 mhz triggering rate ) . since the measured background noise comes from a continuous - wave pump , we expect the corresponding noise level in the gated case to be reduced by a factor equal to the duty cycle , which will push the snr to @xmath82 at the optimum conversion efficiency .        </S>",
    "<S> * telecommunications band frequency conversion interface * in addition to frequency conversion within the @xmath20 nm band , we can use the same device for frequency conversion between the @xmath26 nm and @xmath20 nm bands . as illustrated by figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 5a and 5c , with one pump in each band , the signal can be upconverted ( downconverted ) from the @xmath26 nm ( @xmath20 nm ) band to the @xmath20 nm ( @xmath26 nm ) band . although the pump power available from our @xmath20 nm laser is limited ( maximum @xmath83 mw ) , </S>",
    "<S> it can be compensated by using a relatively strong pump in the @xmath26 nm band , since the conversion efficiency is determined by the product of the two pump powers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5b shows one example of upconversion , measured using the experimental setup shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s6 of the supplementary , where the signal is separated from the @xmath26 nm pump by @xmath84 fsrs ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) . in the @xmath20 nm band spectrum , the converted blue idler ( @xmath14 ) shows a conversion efficiency @xmath86 db while the red idler ( @xmath15 ) is much weaker ( as in the @xmath20 nm intraband case , we define conversion efficiency in terms of photon flux ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the conversion efficiency indicates different frequency detunings for the two idlers , which is expected as high - order dispersion terms become important when @xmath38 is large ( see supplementary section iv for more detailed discussions ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find the amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) around the @xmath26 nm pump ( largely due to the edfa ) is also upconverted to the @xmath20 nm band ( small peaks around the @xmath20 nm pump ) . by adding a narrowband filter after the edfa , the ase of the @xmath26 nm pump can be suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> as one would expect , if efficient @xmath26 nm to @xmath20 nm upconversion can be achieved in this system , efficient @xmath20 nm to @xmath26 nm downconversion should also be achievable , and easily measured by simply moving the input signal to the @xmath20 nm band ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5c ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5d shows a representative downconversion spectrum when the separation between the input signal and the @xmath20 nm band pump is @xmath87 fsrs ( @xmath88 ) , where in this case a narrowband ase rejection filter surrounding the @xmath26 nm pump is applied ( see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s7a ) . along with a conversion efficiency for @xmath14 that is similar to the upconversion case ( @xmath89 db ) , </S>",
    "<S> we see the ase rejection filter has successfully suppressed the spurious peaks present in the upconversion spectrum .    to further explore the properties of wideband frequency conversion based on the fwm - bs scheme , we focus on the downconversion case by varying the signal position in the @xmath20 nm band while keeping pump powers in the @xmath26 nm and @xmath20 nm band @xmath45  @xmath75 mw and @xmath84 mw , respectively ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6a ) . as we increase the separation between the signal and the @xmath20 nm pump ( i.e. , @xmath19 increases ) , the blue idler @xmath14 moves away from the @xmath26 nm pump by an equal amount of frequency shift with slowly decreasing power </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the red idler @xmath15 shows slightly worse conversion efficiency than @xmath14 when @xmath19 is small , but as @xmath19 increases its power decreases much more rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> their different performance can be understood by calculating the corresponding frequency detunings ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6a inset , right ) , which reveal that @xmath14 has a small frequency detuning for up to @xmath90 fsr separation from the @xmath26 pump , while the frequency detuning for @xmath15 is already comparable to the resonance linewidth after @xmath65 fsrs . in fig .  6b </S>",
    "<S> , the conversion efficiencies for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are extracted from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6a ( markers ) , and agree with the simulation results based on coupled mode equations ( solid lines , see supplementary section i.b ) . with </S>",
    "<S> less than @xmath91 mw total pump power , the maximum conversion efficiency for @xmath14 is measured to be @xmath45  @xmath92 ( @xmath93 db ) , and the spectral range over which the input signal can be tuned without reducing the conversion efficiency by more than @xmath94  db ( i.e. , conversion efficiency @xmath95 ) is estimated to be nearly @xmath96 thz . even when the signal is @xmath97 thz away from the @xmath20 nm pump , the conversion efficiency for @xmath14 is still more than @xmath76 .    to measure the snr level for the wideband frequency conversion ( see supplementary section v ) , </S>",
    "<S> we turn off the signal and measure the noise at the idler frequency while keeping the pumps on . </S>",
    "<S> narrowband filters are added at the input side for each pump to suppress its ase level so that the single - photon - level signal and idlers are not overwhelmed by the ase noise . for the upconversion case as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5a , the @xmath26 nm pump is expected to generate little noise in the @xmath20 nm band as already demonstrated in the @xmath20  nm intraband frequency conversion ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4e ) , although it is not trivial to suppress the @xmath20 nm pump to sub pw level on the detection side ( @xmath98 db suppression ) so that single - photon - level noise can be measured . for the downconversion case , </S>",
    "<S> the noise is found to be mostly from the @xmath26 nm pump and the contribution of the @xmath20 nm pump is negligible . at the output , after filtering out the @xmath26 nm pump , the transmitted light goes through a narrowband filter with a tunable bandwidth ( @xmath99 pm to @xmath72 pm ) and center wavelength ( @xmath100 nm to @xmath101 nm ) before detection by a spad . when the @xmath26 nm pump is off - resonance , the noise power scales with the filtering bandwidth and exhibits a smooth spectral response as we shift the center wavelength of the filter , indicating it is a broadband noise . on the other hand , when we tune the pump into resonance , the detected noise initially stays the same if the narrowband filter is out of resonance , but increases significantly if the filter is centered on the idler resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the increased noise power changes little as we adjust the filtering bandwidth , suggesting this portion of noise is resonant . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6c shows the measured on - chip noise power for idlers with different spectral separation from the @xmath26 nm pump ( power fixed @xmath102 mw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pump - off - resonance noise is identified as anti - stokes raman scattering generated inside fiber after the edfa , as the noise is almost the same if we remove the chip and introduce a similar insertion loss between two lensed fibers ( see supplementary section vi for more details ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the resonant noise ( i.e. , noise generated at the idler frequency with bandwidth limited by the cavity linewidth ) for the pump - on - resonance case is believed to be from the @xmath103 microresonator , and decreases rapidly as the idler moves away from the pump . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the resonant noise is measured to be @xmath45  @xmath84 pw for the @xmath88 idler ( @xmath104 nm resonance ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the input signal is from a single photon emitter with a photon flux @xmath105 s@xmath74 ( @xmath59 pw power ) , the converted blue idler has a power @xmath45  @xmath106 pw ( @xmath89 db conversion efficiency ) . at first glance , it seems the signal will be overwhelmed by the noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , just as we discussed in the intraband conversion case , for a triggered single photon source , either gated detection or temporal gating of the light exiting the frequency conversion device can be used , with a typical duty cycle of @xmath81 . this will improve the snr to be more than unity under current conditions . another straightforward route to reducing the noise power is to design a frequency - matched idler that has a larger spectral separation from the pump . </S>",
    "<S> improving the si@xmath4n@xmath5 material quality may also be important , as the resonant noise is suspected to be correlated with the significant material absorption inferred by a relatively large thermo - optic shift for the pump modes in the @xmath26 nm band ( see supplementary section iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6d shows that for a fixed idler ( @xmath88 at @xmath104 nm ) , the pump - off - resonance noise has a linear dependence on the pump power while the resonant noise is clearly nonlinear . </S>",
    "<S> since the conversion efficiency is determined by the product of two pump powers , and the @xmath20 nm pump is expected to generate little noise in the @xmath26 nm band due to the large spectral separation , it seems possible to improve the snr dramatically by using a relatively large @xmath20 nm pump ( e.g. , @xmath18 mw ) and a smaller @xmath26 nm pump ( e.g. , @xmath107 mw ) . </S>",
    "<S> optimizing the noise performance of this downconversion interface will be a subject of future studies .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion * we have demonstrated efficient single - photon - level frequency conversion through four - wave - mixing bragg scattering ( fwm - bs ) in monolithic si@xmath4n@xmath5 microring resonators . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to parametric amplification ( pa ) , which is the basis of the majority of prior work in kerr - based nanophotonic devices  @xcite , fwm - bs avoids spontaneous emission noise and can be , in principle , noiseless  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated background noise powers in the fw to pw range , and potential routes to reduce this further have been identified . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of these devices is already comparable to what has been demonstrated for fwm - bs in highly nonlinear fibers and photonic crystal fibers and in some respects , such as pump power required and extent of the spectral translation range , exceeds them . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the versatility of the fwm - bs process has been demonstrated . because the frequency translation range is set by the difference in pump frequencies ( in contrast to frequency conversion by either pa or the @xmath10 nonlinearity ) , our devices enable both intraband conversion ( translation range between 1.8  nm and 9.0  nm shown with no degradation in performance ) and interband conversion ( upconversion and downconversion over a translation range @xmath8560  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these devices are already suitable for proof - of - principle qfc experiments with single photon fock states , and the concepts we utilize - dispersion engineering to ensure frequency matching and tailored waveguide coupling to ensure efficient injection of the signal and pumps and extraction of the converted idler - can be readily applied to connect visible - wavelength quantum light sources ( e.g. , based on color centers in diamond or trapped atoms and ions ) with the telecommunications band .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several topics to be addressed in the pursuit of such goals . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a resonantly - enhanced process comes at the expense of bandwidth , which is set by the cavity linewidth @xmath108  ghz in both the 980  nm and 1550  nm bands . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this bandwidth is large enough to accommodate the photons generated by single inas / gaas quantum dots  @xcite , our intended target application , and recently demonstrated quantum light sources in the si@xmath4n@xmath5 platform would also be compatible  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ghz bandwidth stands in contrast to compact wavelength converters based on cavity optomechanics  @xcite , which have been limited to the mhz range ( at most ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , even with a sufficiently large bandwidth , the precise temporal profile of the incoming photon s wavepacket is an important consideration when determining the efficiency with which it can be coupled into the frequency conversion cavity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , bandwidth and temporal shaping to efficiently load the cavity are topics that will need to be considered when moving from frequency conversion of continuous - wave signals to pulsed light . finally , </S>",
    "<S> while the focus of our discussion has been on the demanding application of qfc , the potential classical applications of this work are also significant . </S>",
    "<S> this includes add - drop wavelength multiplexing and cross - connect switching that utilize the interband fwm - bs process , and spectral translation of signals across hundreds of nanometers to connect , for example , atomic frequency references with telecommunications - band signals .    </S>",
    "<S> first , the layer stack is created by low - pressure chemical vapor deposition of a 480  nm thick si@xmath4n@xmath5 layer on top of a 3  @xmath19 m thick sio@xmath109 layer , which in turn was grown via thermal oxidation of a 100  mm si wafer . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength - dependent refractive index and thickness of the layers are determined using a spectroscopic ellipsometer , with the data fit to an extended sellmeier model . after dicing into chips , </S>",
    "<S> the microring - waveguide devices are created by electron - beam lithography of a negative tone resist , followed by reactive ion etching of the si@xmath4n@xmath5 using a cf@xmath110/chf@xmath4 chemistry , removal of deposited polymer and remnant resist , and annealing at 1150  @xmath111c in an o@xmath112 environment for 3 hours .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulations presented in this work are based on coupled mode equations as well as a modified lle method . for the @xmath20 nm intraband conversion , </S>",
    "<S> we first study a simplified set of coupled mode equations ( which neglects pump mixing in the @xmath26 nm band and high - order idler generation in the @xmath20 nm band ) to gain some physical insight ( supplementary section i.a . ) , from which the mode splitting observed in the experiment ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b , case iv ) can be easily understood . </S>",
    "<S> next , a modified lle method is developed ( supplementary section i.c ) , which is essentially a systematic way to implement the same coupled mode equations by including a complete set of resonant modes . the simulation results shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a and 4c show good agreement between the lle simulation and the experimental results , indicating it has captured all relevant physical mechanisms . as for the wideband frequency conversion between the @xmath26 nm and @xmath20 nm bands , since the pump mixing is absent , the lle method is expected to generate almost the same results as the coupled mode equations . </S>",
    "<S> we use the coupled mode equations to study the device s performance , as its numerical computation is much faster than the lle method ( supplementary i.b ) . </S>",
    "<S> additional discussions on the upconversion and the effect of pump detunings to the frequency conversion process are also provided in the supplementary material ( section iv ) .    </S>",
