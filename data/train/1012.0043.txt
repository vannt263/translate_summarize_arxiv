    "nonlinear transport phenomena in high mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems have recently received considerable attention , motivated originally by the observation of microwave - induced resistance oscillations which under certain conditions can evolve into zero resistance states in high mobility gaas / algaas samples.@xcite these studies have led to other interesting experimental observations , such as nonlinear effects driven by direct current ( dc ) , for example , hall - effect induced resistance oscillations , zero differential resistance states , and current instabilities.@xcite theoretically , it has been shown that the observed microwave and dc bias driven nonlinear phenomena in high mobility 2deg samples originate from the non - equilibrium distribution function and landau quantization.@xcite currently , the above mentioned nonlinear phenomena have been studied exclusively in extremely high mobility gaas / algaas structures . on the other hand , driven partly by quantum information proposals , there is an increasing interest in ingaas structures which offer a larger electron g - factor and strong spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    in this work we discuss yet other non - linear phenomena : strong distortion of shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations leading to phase inversion , and zero current anomaly ( zca ) .",

    "the focus of this paper is to investigate nonlinear effects in the differential resistance of high mobility in@xmath1ga@xmath2as / inp quantum well ( qw ) structures over a wide magnetic field range . in particular , we extend our study into the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) regime which has not been accessible previously , in ref .",

    "it is evident from fig .",
    "8(a ) that the zca effect is also present in the gaas /algaas sample , although it is somewhat narrower than in ingaas , apparently , due to smaller disorder in a higher mobility sample leading to a smaller zca activation energy .",
    "indeed , applying the same procedure as in the case of ingaas / inp above , we find @xmath104 40 @xmath94v at b=1.51 t , which is approximately 4 times smaller than the value of @xmath105 obtained in ingaas .",
    "this indicates that the zca width is sensitive to disorder ( potential fluctuations ) .",
    "the zca in a higher mobility gaas / algaas structure is expected to become more pronounced at lower temperatures when the thermal energy becomes smaller than the corresponding activation energy @xmath105 .",
    "since the zca effect is observed in both ingaas and gaas samples it may be concluded that the zca is a fundamental property of a 2deg .",
    "it can possibly originate from a coulomb gap in the one - particle dos of interacting electrons in the presence of disorder and magnetic field.@xcite such a dos anomaly has been observed as a zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) in 2d tunneling experiments .",
    "@xcite another phenomenon that has been recently actively discussed in the literature is the zca in the i - v characteristics of quantum point contacts ( qpc).@xcite the zba in qpc experiments has very similar characteristics compared to the ones reported in this work , e.g. in ref .",
    "the zba has a width of @xmath106100  @xmath94v and has a similar temperature dependence vanishing above 1  k. therefore , the results reported in this work may provide additional insights into the origin of these separate , but perhaps related , phenomena .",
    "in summary , we have studied nonlinear transport phenomena in hall - bar samples prepared from ingaas / inp and gaas / algaas structures containing a high - mobility 2deg .",
    "two non - linear phenomena , sdh phase inversion and zca , have been observed in both the material systems .",
    "it is shown that the sdh phase inversion can be well described by isihara s equation@xcite taking into account electron heating effects.@xcite a stripe - like pattern of the sdh inversion effect evolves into diamond - shaped structures in the qhe regime with linear slopes .",
    "the observed transport diamonds at even and odd filling factors can be used for gaining information about the effective electron g - factor and , in principle , for probing other many - particle gaps ; e.g. we speculate that such a technique may be used for testing energy gaps in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "the zca effect is another curious phenomenon to be understood .",
    "this phenomenon is observed as a sharp dip in @xmath107 vs. @xmath3 at temperatures below 1  k in a wide range of quantizing magnetic fields .",
    "it will be interesting to find out whether the observed zca phenomenon is linked to other 2deg experiments where a zero bias anomaly is observed.@xcite",
