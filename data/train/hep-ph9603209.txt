    "direct photon production@xcite in hadronic collisions has long been recognized as an important testing ground for perturbative qcd since many of the ambiguities involved in measuring jets are not present when analyzing photons .",
    "direct photon production in lowest order qcd takes place via annihilation and compton scattering feynman graphs .",
    "since the compton graph involves initial state gluon - quark scattering , measurements of direct photon events can serve as important constraints in the determination of the gluon parton distribution function@xcite .",
    "for such a program to proceed , the greater precision involved in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculations for the hard scattering are used .",
    "nlo calculations for parton+parton@xmath3 have been performed both analytically@xcite and in a monte carlo framework@xcite .    a recent global analysis of direct photon production in hadron collisions has noted a discrepancy between nlo calculations and a large array of data for the transverse momentum @xmath4 distributions of the photon@xcite .",
    "characteristically , in both fixed target and collider experiments , there is an experimental excess of photons at low transverse momentum .",
    "several possible explanations have been put forth to resolve the discrepancy .",
    "these include _ i _ ) improved ( nlo ) treatment of bremsstrahlung contributions@xcite and isolation criteria@xcite , _ ii _ ) modifying gluon distribution functions and qcd scale choices to improve the data / theory agreement@xcite , or usage of alternative parton distribution functions ( pdfs)@xcite , and _ iii _ ) invoking additional partonic @xmath2 smearing effects@xcite .",
    "the latter case comes in two different guises : extra partonic @xmath2 can come from non - perturbative effects from parton binding and intrinsic transverse momentum , or from additional hard multiple parton emissions which can be calculated or modeled in perturbative qcd .",
    "the non - perturbative effects are generally implemented as gaussian smearing in an attempt to match the data .",
    "the perturbative multiple gluon emission effects can be implemented via even higher ( but fixed ) order perturbative calculations , via multiple gluon resummation techniques , or via the parton shower ( ps ) algorithm@xcite .",
    "the resummation and ps approaches both involve approximate _ all orders _ perturbative qcd effects .    in this paper ,",
    "we explore the extent to which the direct photon data can be explained by combining a nlo qcd calculation with multiple parton emission via the parton shower algorithm . in doing so ,",
    "we follow generally the prescription outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where nlo @xmath5 and @xmath6 boson production were merged with parton showers . in these calculations , owens method of phase space slicing is used to evaluate the nlo cross sections@xcite .",
    "this method lends itself to a direct implementation of parton showers wherein a potential problem of double counting multiple parton emissions can be avoided .",
    "we show that our implementation of showering with the nlo qcd calculation yields an excess of events at low @xmath4 relative to the unshowered nlo result at the fermilab tevatron and cern s@xmath7s energies , qualitatively accounting for the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "additional non - perturbative smearing is required for lower energies characteristic of the cern isr or fixed target experiments .",
    "central to our calculation of direct photon production is the numerical integration of phase space via monte carlo methods@xcite .",
    "one begins by evaluating the @xmath8 and @xmath9 direct photon production subprocess feynman graphs , including bremsstrahlung corrections to @xmath10 , _ etc .",
    "_ dimensional regularization is used here for ultraviolet , soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the four - momenta for the @xmath11 subprocess are labeled according to , for instance , @xmath12 ; similarly , for @xmath13 subprocesses , we use @xmath14 , _ etc . _",
    "ultraviolet singularities are renormalized using the @xmath15 prescription@xcite .",
    "collinear singularities are factorized and then absorbed into parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) or fragmentation functions .",
    "soft singularities are canceled between @xmath13 graphs and @xmath11 graphs . at this point , all cross section contributions are finite , so that numerical predictions can be made .    what is peculiar to the monte carlo method of nlo calculation used here is that the phase space integrations are done partly analytically , and partly numerically . the boundary between numerical and analytical methods",
    "is chosen by selecting two theoretical cutoffs to demarcate the collinear and soft regimes .",
    "if any invariant quantity @xmath16 from the @xmath13 subprocess has a value @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , then one is in the collinear regime . in this regime ,",
    "the matrix element squared is evaluated in the leading pole approximation and the integration near the collinear pole is done analytically .",
    "the cross section contribution is _ de facto _ @xmath11 , and it is combined with the leading order and virtual contributions to the @xmath11 subprocesses . if a final state gluon energy ( in the subprocess rest frame ) has value @xmath19 , then one is in the soft regime .",
    "the integrations of the squared matrix elements are performed analytically using the soft gluon approximation , and combined with contributions from @xmath11 subprocesses .",
    "the total @xmath11 results , after factorization , are finite , but depend on @xmath20 and @xmath21 , such that the soft and collinear singularities are recovered in the @xmath22 limit .",
    "the remaining phase space integrations are performed via monte carlo .",
    "this allows easy binning of any desired observables and allows for the simple evaluation of the effect of experimental cuts on the nlo prediction@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 contributions are all positive definite over phase space , but are also singular as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath11 contributions compensate the @xmath13 contributions and result in a total cross section which is independent of @xmath20 and @xmath21 over a wide range of values@xcite .",
    "the expressions for all @xmath11 and @xmath13 processes in direct photon production , through nlo , are compiled in ref .",
    "this is the starting point of our evaluation of the transverse momentum of the direct photon using a merger of nlo qcd and parton showers .",
    "the ps algorithm combines the simplified collinear dynamics , represented by the @xmath25 evolution of parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions , with the exact kinematics of multiple parton emission@xcite . as implemented here , no additional weights to the integral",
    "are included with parton showers , as the @xmath25 evolved distribution functions and fragmentation functions are used in evaluating the differential cross section .",
    "for the direct photon transverse momentum distribution , initial rather than final state showering is most important . using a backward shower algorithm@xcite ,",
    "the initial state showers are evolved backward from a starting virtuality @xmath26 .",
    "the kinematics of the multiple partons in the initial state shower result in transverse momenta for the partons participating in the hard scattering , effectively boosting the direct photon transverse momentum relative to the collinear approximation of the kinematics . in practice , the parton shower is cutoff at some low @xmath27 value where perturbative qcd is still valid , but where the multiple emissions no longer become resolvable . in all the results described below",
    ", we set @xmath28 gev@xmath29 .",
    "different prescriptions have been worked out for modeling final state showers@xcite as opposed to initial state ( backward ) showers@xcite . at this stage , in a full simulation , the explicit parton emissions would be combined with a hadronization model which converts the partons into detectable particles",
    ". our calculation does not include hadronization .",
    "the inclusion of hadronization should not alter our conclusion that multiple parton emission in the initial state can qualitatively account for the discrepancy between theory and experiment in direct photon production .    while the ps prescription for ll calculations is straightforward , the prescription for merging ps with nlo calculations is not .",
    "one problem is that the shower emission from a @xmath11 subprocess may be double counted by the exact emission of an extra parton in the @xmath13 subprocess .",
    "another problem is that , to be consistent , nlo dynamics should be used to govern the parton shower development .",
    "we use initial and final state shower algorithms consistent with ll dynamics , although we use the nlo parton distribution functions in our calculation of initial state shower probabilities .",
    "consequently , our calculation is not consistent to nlo : the ps algorithm here should be regarded only as a parametrization of a fully consistent nlo ps program . from a practical standpoint , the error induced by",
    "using only collinear dynamics in the ps algorithm in the first place should be far larger than the error induced by neglecting nlo corrections to the underlying collinear shower dynamics .",
    "our goal here is to demonstrate that multiple parton emissions may be responsible for the discrepancy between data and theory at low transverse momentum .    to avoid the double counting problem , we restrict shower development to the @xmath13 subprocesses in which all momentum vectors are large and well separated .",
    "one can view a monte carlo nlo calculation as a sort of truncated parton shower , with only a single extra parton emission , but which is performed exactly to @xmath9 . in this case , the @xmath11 contributions , which include various soft and collinear terms for which the starting shower virtuality would be tiny , would never shower . if the starting shower virtuality is appropriately chosen for the @xmath13 subprocesses , then only energetic , well - separated 3-body final states will develop a parton shower .",
    "thus , the third parton of the @xmath13 subprocess can be viewed as the first of the potentially multiple emissions , but which is performed using exact instead of collinear dynamics .    in our calculation of direct photon production ,",
    "we have started with the nlo calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite merged with the ps along the lines of the preceding discussion .",
    "our computer program generates @xmath11 subprocesses , which frequently have negative weights , along with @xmath30 processes , with positive definite weights , but where @xmath31 .",
    "crucial to our calculation is the stipulation of the starting virtualities for the parton shower .    a naive choice of starting virtuality @xmath26 , such as @xmath32 , ( with @xmath33 )",
    "does not ensure that the 3-parton final state is well separated .",
    "this choice leads to large amounts of showering even for soft or collinear configurations .",
    "one example of allowed showering with @xmath34 is a high @xmath4 photon recoiling against two nearly collinear partons , with @xmath35 but still small .",
    "this is a region of phase space where the @xmath36 and @xmath37 contributions at a specific @xmath38 may cancel . since showering",
    "is implemented only in the @xmath37 processes and may result in a boosted @xmath39 for the @xmath13 contribution , the required cancellation may not occur .",
    "this introduces a dependence on @xmath21 ( and @xmath20 for other configurations ) which is unphysical . in our procedure for merging nlo with ps ,",
    "we minimize ( but never completely eliminate ) the dependence of results on variations of parameters .",
    "to minimize the dependence of results on @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we set the starting virtuality for initial state partons to @xmath40 for @xmath41 , namely , the minimum of all invariants formed by the five momenta in the @xmath37 process , up to a multiplicative constant @xmath42 . with this prescription , any nearly soft or collinear emissions in the @xmath13 subprocess will result in small starting virtualities , and a small probability to shower . only energetic , well separated @xmath13 subprocesses",
    "will develop a significant parton shower in the initial state .",
    "the final state showers are initiated with starting virtuality @xmath43 .",
    "final state showers do not change @xmath38 relative to the unshowered calculation ; they can , however , affect the number of final state photons passing the isolation cut .",
    "direct photon production data from a variety of fixed target and collider experiments have been tabulated as a function of @xmath44 in two recent studies@xcite . to compare against nlo calculations ,",
    "it has proven convenient to plot the quantity @xmath45 .",
    "thus , data in perfect agreement with theory would lie along the @xmath46 horizontal line . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a common trend amongst the various experimental data sets was noticed , when compared against nlo qcd . for almost all data sets tabulated ,",
    "the low @xmath47 range was underestimated by the theory ( nlo qcd ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors were able to improve somewhat the data _ vs. _ theory discrepancy by adjusting independently the factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy between data and theory persists .    in fig .",
    "1_a _ , we show @xmath48 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath47 for data from the cdf experiment@xcite at the fermilab tevatron , using @xmath7 collisions at @xmath0 tev .",
    "the data points are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nlo distributions are calculated using the cteq2 m pdfs@xcite evaluated at the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath49 .",
    "the large enhancement of data over theory can be seen below @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath51 gev at the tevatron .",
    "our calculation employs the same scale choices as ref .",
    "@xcite , but updated cteq3 m pdfs@xcite . in keeping with cdf cuts",
    ", we require the photon pseudorapidity @xmath52 , and a photon isolation cut which requires that the sum of energy , projected transverse to the beam axis , ( @xmath53 ) of parton @xmath54 within a cone of size @xmath55 satisfy @xmath56 these two cuts are also used in figs . 2 and 3 below .",
    "to minimize differences due to parton distribution choices , _ etc .",
    "_ , rather than comparing the data to our nlo calculation merged with parton showers ( nlo@xmath57ps ) , we show the effect of showering as an excess or deficit relative to the unshowered nlo calculation . in figs .",
    "1_b _ and 1_c _ , we show the relative @xmath47 distributions ( nlo@xmath57ps - nlo)/nlo where the initial state virtuality is chosen with @xmath58 . in our calculation",
    ", we have run for subprocess photon @xmath59 gev , since the matrix elements are singular as @xmath60 ; the results do not change noticeably if instead we use @xmath61 gev .",
    "1_b _ employs @xmath62 , and fig .",
    "1_c _ has @xmath63 .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "1@xmath64 and 1@xmath65 that the incorporation of the ps has led to an enhancement of the relative @xmath47 distributions at @xmath66 of about @xmath67 , and hence is in accord with the data for the low range of @xmath47 .",
    "the enhancement has been traced to the fact that a small fraction of the large population of very low @xmath47 photons gets boosted up to higher energies by recoiling against the multiple parton emissions .",
    "although the enhancement at low @xmath47 from the nlo@xmath57ps calculation is similar for the two cases , the large relative @xmath47 distributions show a deficit of @xmath68 .",
    "the high @xmath47 deficit is due to the effect of the photon isolation cut .",
    "for very high energy events , there can still exist significant shower virtualities for events with quasi - soft or collinear partons , which introduces a slight dependence on @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "there is some enhancement in showering for very high energy events , which leads to fewer isolated photons , and a net diminution of signal due to the isolation cut .",
    "if we modify the initial shower virtuality magnitude by varying @xmath42 , we find that a choice of @xmath69 results in modest enhancements of the low @xmath47 region by only @xmath70 . choosing @xmath42 as high as @xmath71 yields enhancements typically around @xmath72 .",
    "also , we have investigated how the results change by changing the initial state shower cutoff virtuality choice from @xmath28 gev@xmath29 to @xmath73 gev@xmath29 .",
    "the latter variation yields typically a @xmath74 effect . in spite of these various uncertainties ,",
    "the overall qualitative trend of enhanced cross section at @xmath75 persists in all the cases we have examined .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was noted that an ad - hoc gaussian smearing of the subprocess @xmath4 led to improved agreement between theory and data . in fig .",
    "1_d _ , we additionally introduce gaussian smearing ( gs ) to both @xmath11 and @xmath13 processes , with average transverse momentum zero and width @xmath76 gev .",
    "the overall enhancement of the nlo@xmath57ps at @xmath66 remains , but with some slight additional enhancement for nlo@xmath57ps@xmath57gs at even lower @xmath47 values .",
    "the small effect of the gaussian smearing at cdf is not surprising since the average boost generated by the ps algorithm is @xmath77 gev .    in fig .",
    "2_a _ , we show data from the ua2 experiment@xcite ( @xmath7 collisions at @xmath78 gev ) compared with nlo qcd , for scale choice @xmath79 . here",
    "we use a photon @xmath4 cutoff of @xmath61 gev .",
    "again , we see that data exceeds theory by @xmath80 , although this time for @xmath50 ( corresponding to @xmath81 gev ) . in fig",
    ". 2_b _ , we plot the nlo@xmath57ps result , using again the initial state virtuality choice @xmath58 , and for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "our merged nlo@xmath57ps calculation gives an enhancement of @xmath84 above nlo results for @xmath50 .",
    "although the cdf and ua2 calculations start with similar virtualities , the relatively higher value of feynman-@xmath85 in the ua2 case leads to lesser amounts of initial state ps radiation . this can be offset to some extent by choosing a higher starting virtuality , @xmath86 , shown in fig .",
    "2_c_. the increase in virtuality leads to a rise in our calculation to about @xmath87 above nlo expectations , in accord with the data . finally , in fig .",
    "2_d _ , we include as well the gaussian smearing , which leads to some additional enhancement at low @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we turn to much lower energy @xmath88 collider results from experiments at the cern isr at @xmath89 gev . in fig .",
    "3@xmath90 , we show the data from the r806 experiment@xcite compared with nlo qcd for @xmath82 .",
    "using the same scale @xmath91 , and including parton showers , we show in figs . @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the comparison ( nlo@xmath57ps - nlo)/nlo for @xmath58 and @xmath86 , respectively . we have lowered the photon @xmath4 cutoff here to @xmath94 gev .",
    "because of the large values of parton @xmath85 and small virtualities , at this energy , there is very little showering , so that perturbative multiple parton emission as described by the ps algorithm can not explain the data / theory discrepancy .",
    "however , gaussian smearing on the order of 1 gev can be a large effect at this energy , where @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath96 gev . in fig .",
    "@xmath97 , we invoke as usual the @xmath98 gev gaussian smearing of the subprocess transverse momentum . in this case",
    ", the smearing can move the low @xmath47 theoretical prediction into rough agreement with the data .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effects of multiple parton emissions on direct photon production in hadronic collisions by merging the ps technique with nlo qcd . for experiments at very high energy ( _ e.g. _ ua2 and cdf ) ,",
    "the extra @xmath2 smearing of the hard scattering subprocess induced by the multiple parton emissions can cause some of the relatively numerous low @xmath4 photons from nlo qcd to be boosted to higher @xmath4 values .",
    "such an effect causes a shift in the predicted @xmath47 distribution , thereby _ improving _ the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "our results can not be interpreted as a qcd prediction due to the many uncertainties in the ps algorithm , and in our merging procedure . amongst these uncertainties",
    "are the nature of the ps algorithm itself , and the prescription for initial and cutoff virtualities in the ps . on the other hand ,",
    "our results can be interpreted as an existence proof that higher order effects ( particularly from multiple parton emission ) can account for the theory _ vs. _ data discrepancy .",
    "other groups@xcite have noted that the theory _ vs. _ data discrepancy can be resolved in nlo qcd mainly by using modified parton distribution functions .",
    "we comment that our result of an appropriately shifted @xmath47 distribution will obtain for any choice of pdf s or hard scattering scale choices , as long as sufficient parton showering can be produced .",
    "since hard scattering processes in nature are of course _ all - orders _ processes , one would expect at some level a discrepancy between data and fixed order qcd to occur .",
    "our results show that this may already be the case for the direct photon @xmath47 distributions .    for lower energy data sets ( _ e.g. _ @xmath99 gev )",
    ", it is difficult to produce sufficient qcd radiation via the ps to improve the theory _ vs. _ data discrepancy .",
    "we do note , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that an intrinsic gaussian @xmath2 smearing with width @xmath100 gev will push the theory in the right direction to match with data .",
    "thus , the theory _ vs. _ data discrepancy can be resolved globally by invoking extra @xmath2 for the hard scattering partons : that @xmath2 would be primarily perturbative in nature for high energy data sets , but mainly non - perturbative for data sets taken at @xmath101 gev .",
