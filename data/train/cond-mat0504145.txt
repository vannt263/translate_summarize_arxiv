    "it is well known that vortices are fundamental ingredients in the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition .",
    "@xcite the simplest models exhibiting this transition are the pure planar rotator model ( prm ) and xy - model . for these models",
    "the transition takes place at critical temperatures @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 , @xcite respectively ( @xmath5 is the exchange constant , @xmath6 the spin length ) .",
    "recently , the study of topological excitations such as vortices and solitons in two - dimensional magnetic lattices containing defects has received a lot of attention .",
    "@xcite such interactions must have interesting consequences for the static and dynamical properties of easy - plane magnets .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations have shown that vortices are attracted and pinned by nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite in fact , the vortex energy is lowered when pinned at a vacancy , resulting in greater preference of single vortex @xcite and vortex - pair @xcite formation on vacancies .",
    "of course , this leads to an overall increase of the system disorder .",
    "all of these factors conspire to reduce the bkt transition temperature with increasing vacancy density , as has already been seen in calculations from refs .   for planar spin models on a two - dimensional square lattice",
    "( see also analytical results using the self - consistent harmonic approximation of ref .  ) .",
    "the important question here is , at what vacancy density is the transition temperature reduced to zero , so that the system is always in the high - t disordered phase ?",
    "this would mean a situation in which there is no low - temperature phase of long - range orientational order , characterized by spin - spin correlations decaying as a power law with distance , and a finite absolute magnetization @xmath7 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "calculations of the helicity modulus for the planar rotator model by leonel _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite indicated that a critical vacancy density @xmath8 causes the critical temperature @xmath0 to drop to zero .",
    "it means that the critical temperature would vanish at @xmath9 , which is above the site percolation threshold , @xmath10 , for a planar square lattice .",
    "lozovick and pomirchi , @xcite also using the jump in the helicity modulus , have found that the bkt phase transition occurs above the percolation threshold in a dilute system of josephson junctions ( using bond dilution ) .",
    "on the other hand , berche _ _ et al.__@xcite calculated the decay of the spin - spin correlation function and its related exponent , @xmath11 , and considered the transition temperature to be located by @xmath12 .",
    "those results suggested that the critical density is closer to @xmath13 ( the number associated with the percolation limit for the square lattice ) .",
    "the monte carlo calculations for this problem naturally are particularly difficult , especially because the interesting region occurs at very low temperature .",
    "furthermore , the statistical fluctuations due to the random choice of positions for the vacancies further increases the numerical noise in the calculations  this effect itself becomes particularly troublesome especially when @xmath1 surpasses 0.3 ( 30% ) .",
    "as such , it seems important to make more reliable estimates for the critical vacancy density based on improved mc calculations here .",
    "the calculations mentioned above concern the planar rotator model ( two - component spins lying in xy plane ) . in a specialized model with repulsive vacancies , wysin calculated the reduction of @xmath0 in an easy - plane heisenberg model , with three - component spins with anisotropic couplings of their components.@xcite the vacancies were not allowed to be on nearest or next nearest neighbor lattice sites , which made it possible to calculate the vorticity density in the model .",
    "however , that calculation did not concern itself with the determination of the critical vacancy density , because the constraint of repulsive vacancies limits the possible vacancy density to be less than 18% , well below the critical value .",
    "therefore , for comparison with the planar rotator , we also consider here the vacancy effects in the ( three - component ) xy - model , with randomly placed non - repulsive vacancies .    after describing the model hamiltonians",
    ", we give an overview of the different methods used to estimate the transition temperature .",
    "this is followed by some specific comments on the monte carlo schemes applied to this problem .",
    "the data obtained for the planar rotator and xy models are presented , followed ultimately by our conclusions .",
    "the spin models under consideration can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 indicates nearest neighbor sites of an @xmath16 square lattice , and @xmath5 is the ferromagnetic exchange coupling between spins @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the spins @xmath17 have two components for the planar rotator model and three components for the xy - model ; in the latter case , however , only the xy components are coupled .",
    "the occupation variables @xmath19 take the values @xmath20 or @xmath21 depending on whether the associated site is occupied by a spin or vacant .",
    "a fraction @xmath1 of the sites are chosen randomly to be vacant .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that the monte carlo calculations here must make adequate averages over different choices of the vacancy positions , for a chosen density .",
    "the planar rotator model has effectively a single degree of freedom per site  the angle of the spin within the xy plane .",
    "the main distinction of the xy model is the presence of the extra @xmath22 components , which act as degrees of freedom , but do not appear in the hamiltonian .",
    "the xy model therefore involves two degrees of freedom per spin .",
    "this increases the entropy effects at a given temperature and results in a lower @xmath0 compared to the planar rotator .",
    "the mc algorithm for the xy model must involve the possibility to change all three spin components for the xy model , while preserving the spin length .",
    "the lack of significant sharp peaks in the thermodynamic quantities versus temperature @xmath23 for these models , especially in finite @xmath16 lattice systems , means that precisely locating @xmath0 is difficult .",
    "therefore , it is useful to apply several different approaches , all essentially based on the scaling of the thermodynamics with the system size or edge length @xmath24 .",
    "as the monte carlo algorithm proceeds , the total system instantaneous in - plane magnetization @xmath25 is observed , @xmath26 additionally , statistical fluctuations give the susceptibility components for temperature @xmath23 , @xmath27 the number of spins in the system is @xmath28 .",
    "the average of @xmath29 and @xmath30 defines the in - plane susceptibility , @xmath31 a rough estimate of @xmath0 can be obtained from the size - dependence of binder s fourth order cumulant@xcite @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 for any @xmath24 , the asymptotic values are @xmath34 , @xmath35 . at the critical temperature , @xmath32 is approximately independent of the system size , hence , @xmath0 can be estimated from the crossing point of curves of @xmath36 for various @xmath24 .",
    "an example of such crossing behavior is given in fig .",
    "[ u04_pr ] , for the prm at @xmath37 . in practical application , due to the statistical uncertainties",
    ", there is usually no clear crossing point , especially at higher vacancy concentrations .",
    "instead , @xmath0 is very close to the point where different curves of @xmath36 begin to separate from the low - t asymptotic value .",
    "although very reliable , this approach is not very accurate , and requires mc calculations for many temperatures near @xmath0 .",
    "another approach to determine @xmath0 is based on the calculation of the helicity modulus per spin , @xmath38 .",
    "it is a measure of the resistance to an infinitesimal spin twist @xmath39 across the system along one coordinate , defined in terms of the dimensionless free energy , @xmath40 , @xmath41 any general model hamiltonian leads to the expression , @xmath42 , \\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the inverse temperature . for either the planar rotator or xy model",
    ", the required operators to be averaged ( in limit @xmath44 ) can be expressed using the cartesian spin components ,    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a unit vector pointing from site @xmath48 to site @xmath49 .",
    "the sum determining @xmath50 only includes pairs of lattice sites displaced by @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , one expects the mean of @xmath50 to be quite small , while its fluctuations do contribute to the helicity formula ( [ y1 ] ) .",
    "the sum for @xmath52 is seen to be proportional to the original hamiltonian .    according to renormalization - group theory , the helicity modulus in an infinite system jumps from the finite value @xmath53 to zero at the critical temperature . assuming this applies also to the spin - diluted model , as argued in ref .",
    ", @xmath0 can be estimated from the intersection of @xmath38 and the straight line , @xmath54 the trend in the intersection point with increasing @xmath24 can be observed , as shown for the prm at @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ y04_pr ] . generally speaking , the mc data for @xmath38 show a steeper drop in the critical region as @xmath24 increases .",
    "the larger system size used , the lower will be the intersection point and estimated @xmath0 .",
    "hence this method will always lead to an over - estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "finally a third approach was also applied for estimating @xmath0 , employing the finite size scaling of the in - plane susceptibility , as used in a pure xxz model by cuccoli _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite and in the same model with repulsive vacancies by wysin .",
    "@xcite in the absence of vacancies , it is the most precise method , because the statistical fluctuations in @xmath55 can be reduced by extended mc averaging much more effectively than those of the helicity modulus or binder s cumulant .",
    "we assume that near and below @xmath0 , a power law scaling of the susceptibility holds , even in the presence of vacancies , @xmath56 where @xmath11 is the exponent for the in - plane spin correlations below @xmath0 ( see ref .  ) . by using this equation with calculations at several lattice sizes ,",
    "the exponent @xmath11 can be fitted as a function of temperature .",
    "an indication of how @xmath55 scales with system size is given in fig.[xfits04_pr ] , again for the prm at 4% vacancy concentration .",
    "one can note clearly how the exponent @xmath57 ( slope of log - log plot for @xmath58 ) decreases as the temperature increases , especially rapidly as @xmath23 passes the transition temperature .    for the pure pr and xy models ( no vacancies )",
    ", the transition is located at the temperature where @xmath59 .",
    "then , under that assumption that the vacancies do not change the basic symmetries in the transition , but only increase the effective entropy present , we can expect that the transition can be located in the same way under the presence of vacancies , solving @xmath60 in the absence of any particular theory for the model with vacancies , this can be expected to be a reasonable definition for @xmath0 .",
    "analysis of power - law fits of the spin - spin correlations in the diluted prm @xcite also demonstrated that @xmath0 occurs very close to the temperature from eq .",
    "( [ deftc ] ) .",
    "its validity is further verified here by the comparison with the results for @xmath0 due to the helicity modulus , and due to binder s cumulant , the latter of which is reliable for any kind of model , with or without vacancies .",
    "[ eta04_pr ] shows its application for the prm at 4 % vacancy concentration , leading to @xmath61 , exactly consistent with the estimate from binder s cumulant ( fig.[u04_pr ] ) .",
    "we also note , that for the pure prm ( no vacancies ) , this fitting of @xmath11 , using systems as large as @xmath62 , leads to the estimate @xmath63 , slightly higher than that from ref .  .",
    "thermal averages for a given system size and temperature were obtained using a hybrid mc approach , including metropolis single - spin moves and over - relaxation moves@xcite that can modify all spin components , in combination with wolff single - cluster moves@xcite that modify only the xy components .",
    "these are based on standard approaches for spin models , as developed in many references.@xcite further details , as applied to a system with vacancies , can be found in ref .  .",
    "using a hybrid method including cluster and over - relaxation is very important especially at low temperatures , as it very effectively reduces the problems associated with critical slowing down .",
    "the programming used for the xy model also applies to the planar rotator model ; it is only necessary to set the out - of - plane components @xmath64 and then never allow them to change for the prm .",
    "thus it is straightforward to study the two models with essentially the same mc approach .",
    "the calculations were performed for a range of system sizes , including @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for a given @xmath67 lattice",
    ", the number of vacancies placed at random locations was @xmath68 ( spins removed from system or equivalently , set to zero length ) .",
    "for larger systems or very low vacancy density , the results are nearly independent of the particular random choice of vacancy positions . in the general case , however , it is necessary to average over equivalent systems ( same @xmath24 , @xmath1 ) with different particular choices of the vacancy locations .",
    "the statistical variations in the averages are most significant especially as the vacancy density approaches the critical value that forces @xmath0 to zero .",
    "these statistical variations also are strongest in the smaller systems ; conversely , the larger systems tend to average out these fluctuations , all the better as their area increases .",
    "therefore we averaged over a number @xmath69 copies of the system , with this number taken largest at small system size . for @xmath70 , we used @xmath71 for @xmath72 , respectively . for larger density ,",
    "@xmath73 , we doubled these values for @xmath69 , and additionally included runs with @xmath74 for @xmath62 .    for thermal equilibration before calculating averages , @xmath75 mc steps ( mcs ) sites",
    "] were applied for small systems ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 mcs for large systems . for each of the @xmath69 individual realizations of a given @xmath24 and @xmath1 , averages at one temperature",
    "were calculated using between 20,000 and 80,000 mcs ( @xmath78 ) , with the greatest number applied to the larger systems .",
    "for example , calculation for one temperature of a @xmath79 lattice at @xmath80 involved an average over @xmath81 million mcs .",
    "on the other hand , one temperature of a @xmath82 lattice at @xmath83 involved an average over @xmath84 mcs .",
    "near 0% vacancy density , these mc parameters produce insignificant error bars ; when @xmath1 exceeds 30% , on the other hand , the resulting error bars are considerably greater and resist reduction .",
    "as suggested above , the error bars in @xmath85 , @xmath55 , and @xmath32 can be reduced more readily by increasing @xmath69 than by increasing @xmath78 when significant vacancy density is present ( especially at @xmath86 ) .",
    "calculations were carried for a range of vacancy densities from zero to 50% .",
    "we especially concentrated on the region @xmath87 , which required the most careful analysis . for vacancy density",
    "less than 30% , it is clear that there is a transition at a finite temperature , for both the pr and xy models . at the higher vacancy concentrations , statistical errors were generally more significant .",
    "even so , looking at the trends in the data with system size , in the following we show the mc evidence that the transition temperature is reduced to zero when the vacancy concentration is approximately 40% , for both models .      at low vacancy concentrations ( @xmath88 )",
    ", mc results for @xmath32 , @xmath85 , @xmath55 , and @xmath89 bear a great resemblance to those shown above for 4% vacancies , with fairly smooth dependencies on temperature .",
    "the primary modification is the general trend of important features towards lower temperature with increasing @xmath1 . at higher concentrations ,",
    "errors become more significant . for example , the helicity modulus at 33% vacancies and various system sizes is shown in fig .",
    "[ y33_pr ] .",
    "in addition to larger relative errors , the absolute magnitude of @xmath85 is drastically reduced .",
    "it is very clear , however , that the bkt transition is still present at this concentration , with @xmath90 as estimated from the crossing point of the @xmath91 data .",
    "this is additionally supported by the corresponding behavior of binder s cumulant , seen in fig .",
    "[ u33_pr ] , which gives the estimate @xmath92 , somewhat lower , as can be expected .",
    "an indication of the tendency for reduction of @xmath0 with vacancy concentration is given in fig .",
    "[ y_pr ] , showing a collection of results all for @xmath91 systems .",
    "while these crossing points consistently overestimate @xmath0 , a better view of this critical point reduction is provided by the various graphs of @xmath89 at different concentrations , fig .",
    "[ eta_pr ] .",
    "one can see clearly that once the vacancy concentration passes a value around 41% , the fitted value of @xmath11 does not fall below the value @xmath93 , at least for the lowest temperatures used ( @xmath94 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ tc_pr ] , the critical temperatures extracted from @xmath11 and eq .  ( [ deftc ] ) and from the helicity modulus ( using @xmath91 ) are shown as functions of vacancy concentration . as mentioned above , the crossing point of @xmath38 with eq.([line ] ) for any finite system always overestimates @xmath0 , with less error as larger systems are used .",
    "the fitting of @xmath11 is more reliable ; the data shown here used the scaling fitting of @xmath55 using systems with sizes @xmath72 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath0 estimated using @xmath95 are summarized in table [ tctable ] .",
    "the results give strong evidence for extinction of the bkt transition at a vacancy concentration close to 41% .",
    ".[tctable ] dependence of dimensionless critical temperature @xmath96 on @xmath1 , as derived from the scaling of in - plane susceptibility @xmath55 , and using @xmath95 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the general trends in mc data for the xy model are rather similar to those found for the planar rotator . the most obvious distinction , however , is that the extra entropy due to the out - of - plane spin component forces the transition temperature to be lower in the xy model , no matter what vacancy concentration is considered .",
    "it is interesting to show some data at 40% vacancy concentration , where the transition is seen to occur very slightly above zero temperature . in fig .",
    "[ y40_xy ] the helicity modulus for system sizes from @xmath97 to @xmath62 is displayed .",
    "as the data for increasing system size is seen to systematically fall to lower values , this graph alone can not undeniably prove the presence of a transition .",
    "however , when taken in conjunction with the fits for @xmath11 , which passes the value @xmath93 around @xmath98 , we can say that even at 40% vacancy density there occurs a transition at finite temperature . this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eta_xy ] , where @xmath89 is shown for the various vacancy concentrations studied . on the other hand , performing the mc calculations at temperatures as low as @xmath94 , the exponent @xmath11 does not acquire such a low value as @xmath93 even for 41% vacancy concentration .    in fig .",
    "[ tc_xy ] , the critical temperatures extracted from @xmath11 and eq .",
    "( [ deftc ] ) and from the helicity modulus ( using @xmath91 ) are shown as functions of vacancy concentration .",
    "the numerical values as derived using @xmath95 are given in table [ tctable ] .",
    "just as in the pr model , these results demonstrate the extinction of the bkt transition at a vacancy concentration close to 41% .",
    "as the transition is controlled by the in - plane spin components , the presence of the extra @xmath22 component in the xy model changes the overall scale of transition temperatures , but does not affect the critical vacancy concentration .",
    "finally , we can also make some comparison to the xy model using repulsive vacancies studied in ref .  .",
    "considerable data was presented there for the case of 16% vacancies .",
    "therefore it is interesting to note how the transition temperature is changed if the vacancies are allowed to be at completely random positions in the current model .",
    "a graph of @xmath89 for this case is given in fig .",
    "[ eta16_xy ] , showing clearly the transition occurring at @xmath99 . alternatively , and even with less computational effort",
    ", the transition can be found as done in refs .   by plotting @xmath100 vs. @xmath23 , taking @xmath101 , and looking for the common crossing point of data at various system sizes .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ xs16_xy ] , which gives the same estimate for @xmath0 . in the repulsive vacancy model at the same vacancy concentration , the transition occurs at a slightly higher temperature , @xmath102 .",
    "the result is reasonable ; there is greater disorder in the model with fully random vacancies , hence , requiring less thermal disordering due to temperature to reach the high - temperature phase .",
    "( alternatively , the repulsive vacancy model has more built - in order and hence requires greater thermal energy per spin to reach the high - temperature phase . )",
    "hybrid mc calculations applied to the planar rotator and xy models on a 2d square lattice show that the bkt transition is extinguished ( @xmath103 ) at a vacancy concentration close to 41% , a number related to the percolation limit",
    ". then , although the bkt phase transition has an unusual nature , in which the topological long - range order is destroyed by the unbinding of vortices , the percolation problem of systems exhibiting such a transition must have some similarities to the traditional @xmath104 ising model . in general , the transition temperatures for the xy model are lower than those for the pr model , due to the extra entropy of out - of - plane spin motions , but otherwise , the static properties are closely related .",
    "the transition temperatures were determined most precisely using the finite - size scaling of the in - plane magnetic susceptibility , under the assumption that the spin - correlation exponent @xmath11 goes to the universal value @xmath93 at the transition , regardless of the vacancy concentration .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the presence of spin vacancies does not change any fundamental symmetries of the problem .",
    "@xmath0 calculated this way is completely consistent with the corresponding results from the helicity modulus and binder s fourth order cumulant . at vacancy concentration higher than 41%",
    ", the intrinsic disorder of the system always produces a phase with short range correlations that decay exponentially , i.e. , the usual `` high - temperature '' bkt phase whose properties are strongly determined by the presence of unbound vortices and antivortices . the lack of percolation across the system at @xmath105 disrupts the ability to generate topological long - range correlations .",
    "it then becomes impossible to lower the temperature adequately to reach the ordered phase of very low vortex density , dominated by spin waves .",
