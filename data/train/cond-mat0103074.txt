    "since onsager s @xcite celebrated solution of the ising model free energy in 1944 , followed by yang s @xcite proof of onsager s result for the spontaneous magnetization in 1952 , almost half a century has passed during which time many , if not most of the world s most able mathematical physicists have devoted themselves to the problem of elucidating the susceptibility . attempting to list all these contributions would produce a bibliography of prohibitive length , and one that would inevitably commit many sins of omission .",
    "therefore rather than attempt this , we will only make mention of those papers that have directly motivated our work here , and crave the forgiveness of those who we have inadvertently offended .    while much of the notation for describing the square lattice ising model is standard , we begin by defining our notation here both for the benefit of the more casual reader and to emphasize those cases where we deviate from convention . the interactions in the two perpendicular directions are taken to be @xmath6 but we also often set @xmath7 to discuss the isotropic lattice . for high temperatures , @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 are appropriate variables for series expansions @xcite , while for low temperatures , we use @xmath10 and @xmath11 instead .",
    "thus , @xmath12 in many cases , high - temperature and low - temperature formulas can be obtained from each other by kramers - wannier duality with a simple interchange of primes and stars .",
    "the critical temperature is defined by the condition @xmath13 .",
    "a conventional high - temperature variable is @xmath14 , while an often - used low - temperature variable is @xmath15 .",
    "the translations between these and our variables are @xmath16 and @xmath17 and similarly for the primed variables .    in studying the critical behavior ,",
    "we will use both the variable @xmath18 and more frequently @xmath19 to parameterize deviations from the critical temperature . to leading order",
    ", @xmath20    an elliptic parameterization will be useful , and to that end we define the elliptic modulus , @xmath21 let @xmath22 be the spin at lattice site @xmath23 and define the two - point function @xmath24 in terms of the correlation functions the susceptibility is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnetization .    in 1956",
    "syozi and naya  @xcite presented an approximation to the anisotropic high - tempera - ture susceptibility which gave the correct critical point , correct critical exponent , an amplitude estimate that was wrong by less than 1% , and reproduced the first 8 terms of the series expansion .",
    "it was also exact along the disorder line @xmath27 the condition for the disorder line is that @xmath28 along this line the correlations decay exponentially , and the partition function factorizes @xcite .",
    "the disorder condition is of no particular interest in the case of the nearest neighbor square lattice ising model . ] in 1976 a celebrated paper by wu , mccoy , tracy and barouch @xcite showed how the high- and low - temperature expansions of the susceptibility could be understood in terms of a multi - particle expansion , with an odd number of particles being appropriate at high temperatures and an even number at low temperatures . with this interpretation",
    "it became clear that the result of @xcite was just the lowest order , or one - particle approximation to the susceptibility .    in terms of the elliptic modulus @xmath29  ( [ mod ] )",
    "the high- and low - temperature susceptibilities can be written @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , where @xmath32 is the sum over all lattice separations of the @xmath33-particle contribution to the two - point function , and was first given @xcite as a @xmath34-fold multiple integral .",
    "it was subsequently shown that this integral can be reduced to a @xmath33-fold integral of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a fermionic determinant and @xmath37 is an algebraic function .",
    "this reduction has been achieved by various routes  @xcite .",
    "the factor , @xmath36 , appearing in the integrand , which can be expressed in terms of pfaffians  @xcite , has been found to have a product form , first by palmer and tracy in the low temperature regime  @xcite , and then independently by yamada in both the high- and low - temperature regimes  @xcite . from the product form",
    "it readily follows that the first non - zero term in ( [ e1 ] ) is @xmath38 from the original expression one could only conclude that each integral entered at order @xmath39 so clearly massive cancellations occur . while this comes as a surprise if handling the integral  @xcite directly , it follows straightforwardly  @xcite from the product form .    in terms of the elliptic modulus , the first terms in the high- and low - temperature expansions for the isotropic ( @xmath40 ) susceptibility are @xmath41 and @xmath42 where e and k are the complete elliptic integrals . ] of the second and first kind respectively .",
    "anisotropic versions of these formulae are given in section  [ sect : integrals ] .",
    "simple forms for higher terms in the expansion are not known .",
    "in @xcite one of us gave compelling evidence that unlike the free - energy and spontaneous magnetization , the _ anisotropic _ susceptibility @xmath43 is not _ differentiably finite .",
    "_ a series in @xmath44 variables , @xmath45 , is said to be _ differentiably finite _ or _ d - finite _ if and only if it satisfies a system of @xmath44 partial differential equations of the form @xmath46 where the @xmath47 are polynomials and for each @xmath48 , @xmath49 is not the null polynomial , see _ e.g. _ proposition 2.2 in @xcite .",
    "thus the expression for the susceptibility was shown to be in a different  and less tractable  class of function than other known properties of the ising model .",
    "the evidence for this was based on the observation ( not proved ) that the anisotropic susceptibility @xmath50 as a function of @xmath51 with @xmath52 fixed has a natural boundary on the unit circle @xmath53    for the _ isotropic _ susceptibility , another of us @xcite provided strong confirmation ( though again , not a proof ) of this observation by showing that the circle @xmath54 in the complex @xmath55 plane is a natural boundary .",
    "these two observations are discussed further in section  [ sect : circle ] , following a discussion of the general anisotropic case in section  [ sect : si ] .    in section  [",
    "sect : dfinite ] we also prove the important result that while @xmath56 is not d - finite , @xmath57 _ is _ d - finite for all @xmath58    two other directions in which we have achieved substantial progress are in the generation of series coefficients for the individual series @xmath59 continuing work initiated in @xcite , and even greater progress in obtaining the coefficients of the total series @xmath60 using nonlinear partial difference equations for the correlation functions  @xcite .    in order to generate the series for the total susceptibility @xmath61 or @xmath62 without computing separately the @xmath33-particle contributions , a more efficient method of series generation",
    "is obtained by first returning to the expression  ( [ 1.8 ] ) of the susceptibility as the sum over all lattice separations of the two - point correlation functions .    in the scaling limit",
    ", the two - point functions were found to satisfy a nonlinear differential equation of painlev type  @xcite which was then solved to give the leading scaling terms @xmath63 and @xmath64 exactly @xcite .",
    "in 1980 , a discrete analogue of this equation was discovered by mccoy and wu  @xcite which holds for the two - point functions of the lattice ising model at arbitrary temperature , and which reduces to the painlev equation in the scaling limit . in the same year , a simple set of partial difference equations was derived by perk  @xcite , which reproduced the equation of mccoy and wu and provided an additional equation .",
    "also in the same year , an unrelated set of difference equations , which can be used to compute the correlation functions on the diagonal , @xmath65 , was obtained by jimbo and miwa  @xcite .",
    "many of these developments are described in some detail in @xcite .",
    "the difference equations are valid for arbitrary temperature and were used by kong , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to obtain exactly the leading  short distance \" constant terms in the susceptibility both at the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic points at @xmath66 this work was later extended to give the amplitudes of the term @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "here we dramatically extend that work by obtaining all terms in the  short - distance \" part @xmath68 ( see ( [ 6e ] ) and ( [ 9b ] ) ) of the susceptibility to o@xmath69 details necessary for the generation of @xmath70 appear in section  [ sect : difference ] while in section  [ sect : sdc ] we describe the numerical analysis of the @xmath70 that leads us to conclude that the  short - distance \" terms have the form @xmath71 although clearly nonanalytic at @xmath72 we have denoted these  short - distance \" terms in ( [ 6f ] ) by @xmath73 as a further reminder that they also include the analytical  background . \"",
    "the actual coefficients in ( [ 6f ] ) can be found in the appendix .",
    "the quadratic difference equations of perk @xcite can also be used to generate high- and low - temperature series for @xmath60 and as shown in section [ sect : difference ] the series coefficients can be obtained in polynomial time !    while some people have expressed the view that a polynomial time algorithm for the computation of the series coefficients constitutes a solution , it is clearly preferable to have a closed form expression .",
    "nevertheless , a polynomial time algorithm is equivalent to a complete solution if one seeks only the series coefficients , as to expand any closed form expression also takes polynomial time .",
    "as the history of the development of these key nonlinear recurrences described above shows , the ingredients for such an algorithm have existed unexploited in the literature for many years .",
    "analysis of the resulting series of hitherto unimaginable length combined with the  short - distance \" knowledge contained in ( [ 6f ] ) leads to a solidly based conjecture specifying completely the remaining  scaling \" part of the susceptibility @xmath60 of the isotropic ising model . near the anti - ferromagnetic point the  short - distance \" terms are complete and we simply have for @xmath74    @xmath75    near the ferromagnetic point we conjecture ( for @xmath74 or @xmath76 )    @xmath77    where the scaling - amplitude functions @xmath78 have ( possibly asymptotic ) expansions in integer powers of @xmath79 without any of the powers of @xmath80 present in @xmath81 the leading terms are @xmath82 where @xmath83 in fact the breakdown in equality is dramatic , and we estimate that @xmath84 and @xmath85 where more accurate values of these and further terms in  ( [ 9d ] ) through order @xmath86 are given in the appendix . in section [",
    "sect : anal ] we describe the  short - distance \" subtraction and analysis on which the assumed form of the expansion of the scaling - amplitude function @xmath78  ( [ 9d ] ) is based , while the analysis leading to the numerical values of the coefficients in  ( [ 9d ] ) is sketched in section [ sect : ca ] .",
    "aharony and fisher @xcite have predicted a scaling - amplitude function @xmath87 that is equal above and below @xmath88 on the assumption that the ising model critical region can be described entirely by two nonlinear scaling fields .",
    "our exact result ( [ 9d ] ) is clearly different and furthermore the explicit expansion ( cf .",
    "( 22 - 24 ) in @xcite )    @xmath89    differs from ( [ 9d ] ) at order @xmath90 this is unequivocal evidence for the presence of at least one , and almost surely two , irrelevant operators changes sign in  ( [ 9d ] ) and  ( [ 9c ] ) as we change from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "there is further possible evidence for irrelevant operators in the  short - distance \" terms ( [ 6f ] ) which contain powers of @xmath93 beyond the first starting at @xmath94 , and thus are not of the  energy \" form given by the nonlinear field analysis .",
    "an important numerical study investigating corrections to scaling was that of gartenhaus and mccullough @xcite who confirmed the @xmath95 form in ( [ 9c ] ) through o@xmath96 and provided a good estimate of the term linear in @xmath79 in @xmath97 in ( [ 9b ] ) .",
    "estimates of terms to o@xmath98 in @xmath99 in ( [ 6e ] ) were obtained in @xcite .",
    "an attempt @xcite to go beyond this using longer series than available in @xcite was inconclusive other than to indicate the necessity of terms beyond that predicted by aharony and fisher @xcite .",
    "our numerical work began in part as a modest attempt to improve on @xcite but expanded to where it now clearly quantifies the effect of nonlinear scaling fields @xcite as well as irrelevant operators .",
    "as anisotropy is a marginal operator , extending the present calculation to the anisotropic square lattice would , we expect , be extremely helpful in better understanding the effect of the irrelevant operator(s ) we have identified .",
    "both this and a study of the susceptibility on the triangular and hexagonal lattices are projects we hope to tackle in the near future .",

    "it will be noted that the left - hand side of ( [ 3.24 ] ) is the denominator in the onsager integral for the free - energy and thus we find the ( to us ) surprising result that the singularity of @xmath167 , a property of the ising model in a magnetic field , is intimately connected with a property in zero field .",
    "the full @xmath60 , being a sum of @xmath167 , will naively be expected to be singular at a dense set of points and thus have the onsager line ( [ 3.24 ] ) as a natural boundary .",
    "the presence of natural boundaries has implications for expansions about the physical singularity points @xmath178 that are necessary to understand corrections to scaling .",
    "we briefly explore some of these implications but restrict ourselves for simplicity to the ferromagnetic point @xmath179 in the isotropic model .",
    "we also make the plausible assumption that the singularity in each @xmath167 closest to @xmath72 is the most important for determining , in expansions of @xmath60 , the @xmath180 large @xmath181 asymptotics and this considerably simplifies the discussion map to points on the imaginary axis in the complex @xmath79 plane . ] .",

    "the precise value of this limit is not important since the integrand has a maximum well below the limit . for large @xmath33",
    "only the maximum of the integrand matters and ( [ new29 ] ) reduces to @xmath194 in which the numerical coefficient of @xmath195 is @xmath196 with @xmath122 the smallest real solution of @xmath197 keeping terms such as the correction term in ( [ new27 ] ) and the @xmath198 in ( [ new28 ] ) in the steepest descent analysis lead to o@xmath199 corrections to the exponent in ( [ new30 ] ) so we conjecture that the right hand side of ( [ new30 ] ) is exactly the leading exponential .",
    "it is interesting that the discontinuity ( [ new30 ] ) is similar to that found in weak coupling field theory expansions , but the mechanism producing the cut here does not seem to be related in any way to instantons .    the additional singularities that @xmath60 has at @xmath200 namely terms such as the divergent  scaling \" @xmath63 or the",

    "the coefficient of @xmath180 in the limit @xmath204 will diverge as @xmath205 with @xmath206 .",

    "the contribution of the cut discontinuity to the coefficient , @xmath207 , of @xmath180 in the expansion is then @xmath208    we know little about the cut discontinuity on the circle @xmath54 other than what we have deduced near @xmath209 as given by ( [ new30 ] ) .",
    "however , the fact that the amplitudes of the singularities of @xmath167 on @xmath54 vary dramatically with order @xmath33 almost certainly implies there will be no cancellation of singularities in the sum of @xmath167 that defines @xmath210 furthermore , the variation with order means that there is no length scale at which , as one approaches the circle of singularities @xmath211 @xmath102 can be smooth .",
    "it is these two points taken together that we consider overwhelming evidence that , in the isotropic case at least , @xmath60 has a natural boundary that is the entire @xmath54 circle .",
    "we do not imply by this that all points on the circle are equally  singular \" . as argued above , the existence of an asymptotic expansion about @xmath209 seems likely .",
