    "recent claim @xcite by a group of experimentalists at los alamos that they may be observing neutrino flavor oscillations is a dramatic example of high topical interest in the low and medium energy neutrino physics .",
    "such experiments are now possible , for example , at brookhaven , fermilab and los alamos , just to name a few laboratories among many facilities around the world . as a by - product of this experimental opportunity of having excellent medium energy neutrino beams ( @xmath0 ) being readily available",
    ", a rebirth of exploring with neutrinos the properties of hadrons , particularly nucleons , both in their ground states and the resonance region , is expected .",
    "there is a long history of such investigations [ 2 - 18 ] in the delta(1232 ) resonance region since the sixties , the most recent experiment @xcite in the delta region have been done at brookhaven . given the topical interest of the structure of hadrons from the qcd point of view , the exploration of nucleons and their excited states , _ by both electromagnetic and weak probes _ , merit special attention . in this exploration ,",
    "the weak structure functions are difficult to determine , but they provide valuable information , often complementary to that obtained by the electromagnetic interaction",
    ".    among all the excited states of the nucleon , the delta(1232 ) is perhaps the best studied one @xcite , by strong , electromagnetic and even weak interactions , the last one being the focus of this paper .",
    "along with the nucleon , the delta is of fundamental interest to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and its application to the problem of hadron structure . until we learn how to use qcd rigorously to compute hadron properties , particularly in its low - energy ( hence non - perturbative ) domain",
    ", we must cope with models that are `` qcd - inspired '' .",
    "one of the most successful examples of these imperfect constructs is the quark shell model ( qm ) , in which the gluonic degrees of freedoms are replaced by effective potentials .",
    "the origin of this can be traced back to the pre - qcd sixties , when grsey , radicati @xcite and sakita @xcite described the nucleon and the delta in the fundamental * 56 * -dimensional representation of the spin - flavor su(6 ) symmetry group . in this limit , the nucleon and the delta wave functions are @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "they are degenerate in the symmetry limit .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted by the color hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "thus , in the isgur - karl qm , the wave functions of the nucleon and the delta are @xcite : @xmath3 @xmath4 where the a s and b s are determined by diagonalizing the qm hamiltonian in the n=2 harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the process @xcite @xmath5 in the framework of the non - relativistic qm , using wave functions ( 2 ) . despite a long history of theoretical ( refs.[2 - 14 ] ) and experimental [ 15 - 18 ] investigations of the process , _",
    "no calculations of the amplitudes for the weak transitions are available in the literature in the context of these general wave - functions .",
    "_ our main objective in this paper is to remedy this .",
    "we shall focus in this paper on the all relevant helicity amplitudes .",
    "there are four transverse ones : @xmath6and @xmath7 , where v stands for vector and a represents axial vector .",
    "we shall also discuss the relevant longitudinal ( scalar ) weak amplitudes .",
    "from the electromagnetic processes @xcite @xmath8 we know the vector helicity amplitudes @xmath9 , both extracted from the experiments and as computed in various theoretical approaches , such as the quark model ( qm ) , both non - relativistic @xcite and relativized @xcite , bags @xcite , topological @xcite and non - topological @xcite solitons , and by the lattice gauge theoretic method @xcite .",
    "similarly thorough theoretical investigations on the axial vector amplitudes have been suggested in a recent investigation @xcite in the framework of qm .",
    "this is our objective here : to compute the vector and axial vector amplitudes in the framework of qm .",
    "we shall relate them to the recently extracted adler @xcite amplitudes from the brookhaven neutrino experiment @xcite , which has studied the reaction @xmath10 @xmath11 being spectator neutron .",
    "when necessary , we shall go back to the older experiments as well .",
    "our main goal is to investigate the success of the non - relativistic qm in reproducing the measured transition form factors for the process ( 3 ) . in the case of ( 4 ) , the phenomenologically extracted magnetic dipole ( @xmath12 ) and electric quadrupole ( @xmath13 ) amplitudes@xcite at the real photon point are considerably _ larger _ than the values obtained in the qm .",
    "their values away from the real photon point are not very well - known experimentally as yet .",
    "this is going to change with the advent of the electron facility called the cebaf .",
    "the theoretical deficit of the transition magnetic amplitude , compared to the observed one , seems to be confirmed by the low - energy compton scattering , where the resonant magnetic polarizability appears to be completely dominated@xcite by the delta contribution .",
    "one of our goals here is to see if the axial - vector analogue of the @xmath12 amplitude in the process ( 3 ) can be reproduced in the non - relativistic qm .",
    "we shall also make an estimate of the axial - vector analogue of the e2 amplitudes , which would be zero in the su(6 ) symmetry limit .",
    "thus , its non - zero value would be a direct manifestation of the effect of the color magnetism , just as a non - zero value of the @xmath13 amplitude is in the vector sector .",
    "remainder of this paper is organized as follows : we derive an effective hamiltonian for the qm with vector and axial vector interactions in section ii , wherein we also find a relation between transverse vector and axial vector amplitudes .",
    "the calculation of helicity amplitudes is done in section iii .",
    "we find relations between the helicity amplitudes and adler s form - factors in section iv , for the comparison of our model estimates with experiments .",
    "we collect some exact su(6 ) relations in section v. section vi contains the main results of our qm calculation and its comparison with experiments . in this section ,",
    "we introduce an axial vector analogue of the @xmath14 ratio .",
    "the su(6 ) breaking results in this ratio becoming non - zero .",
    "neutrino experiments can give us an estimate for this ratio .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section vii .",
    "the electroweak interaction at the quark level is incorporated in the dirac equation in the usual fashion .",
    "we introduce the leptonic current @xmath15 for the weak process , which is the analogue of the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath16 : @xmath17 so that the hamiltonian is    @xmath18    by doing a free foldy - wouthuysen reduction @xcite , the quark hamiltonian can be truncated to @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the quark index , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are factors , which , in general , can be different . unless otherwise stated , we shall take these factors to be unity .",
    "we take quark masses @xmath25 to be the same , @xmath26 , for up and down quarks .",
    "we can see that the @xmath27 is the same as interaction hamiltonian of the electromagnetic interaction except for the obvious difference in coupling constants .",
    "the lepton current @xmath15 can be defined , in analogy to the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath16 , as follows : @xmath28 @xmath29 where we introduce a `` weak '' fine structure constant , @xmath30 for emitting or absorbing a weak quantum , w , with four - momentum @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the energy transfer for @xmath33 , given by @xmath34 this is the analogue of the real photon point .",

    "this factor cancels out in the form - factor expression , having no influence on the form - factors we shall calculate . for the transverse amplitude , we use the boson polarization vector to be @xmath35 .",
    "the vector transverse hamiltonian can be separated into two pieces : @xmath36 with @xmath37 @xmath38 taking @xmath39    the correspondence between the usual photon case and the virtual w - boson exchange discussed above , needed for the process ( 3 ) , can be seen by the appropriate identification of the photon variables to the w - boson variables . for transverse axial transition",
    ", @xmath40 does not contribute , and the other term is @xmath41 thus we have an important relation @xmath42 where @xmath43 , denote the possible coupling difference between vector and axial vector parts . if we compare directly with photon transitions , @xmath44 is simply @xmath45 .",
    "the calculation of the longitudinal and scalar amplitudes requires a discussion of the possible lack of current conservation for chiral vector and axial vector currents in the qm space chosen .. though discussions on this issue have been made from time to time in the literature @xcite , this issue is not settled in our opinion . in this paper",
    ", we simply avoid tackling this issue .",
    "we begin here with a discussion of transverse helicity amplitudes .",
    "the leading orders of these amplitudes do not suffer from the uncertainties of the lack of current conservation .",
    "the calculation of the transverse helicity amplitudes for the vector current is standard @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of @xmath46 and @xmath47 taking the effects of the color - hyperfine interaction , can be expressed in terms of su(6 ) basis functions as @xmath48 @xmath49 ignoring the tiny contribution from @xmath50 in ( 1 ) .",
    "these two wave functions correspond @xcite to energy levels @xmath51 , and @xmath52 the transverse helicity amplitudes for the electromagnetic current are defined in the photon - nucleon cm frame @xcite : @xmath53 where the helicity @xmath54 is 3/2 or 1/2 .",
    "these equations are straightforwardly generalizable to the case of our interest , introducing virtual w boson mediating the charged weak current that produces the reaction ( 3 ) . from these quantities",
    ", we can define the familiar @xcite transverse electromagnetic multipoles : @xmath55 @xmath56 we can also define the longitudinal and scalar amplitudes @xmath57 and s@xmath58 , for which the virtual boson or photon helicity is zero . clearly , these two amplitudes are related @xcite : @xmath59 a relation which can @xcite be violated due to truncation of the model space in the qm .",
    "the relation ( 24 ) is a consequence of the conserved vector current ( cvc ) , or equivalently , the gauge invariance of the vector current .",
    "the calculation of the transverse , longitudinal ( and scalar ) amplitudes for the vector current have been done by many authors @xcite .",
    "thus we do not discuss them here .",
    "we shall give here a brief discussion for the axial vector amplitudes .",
    "the longitudinal axial transition operator is given by @xmath60 where we are considering the axial vector term only , eq.(10 ) .",

    "qm calculations of @xmath81 , @xmath70 , @xmath57 and @xmath82 are standard in the literature . for completeness",

    "numerical results of the form - factors from ik model are shown in section vi , subsection d. ratios of helicity amplitudes are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "comparison with experiments is done through the adler form - factors discussed below .",
    "the standard method in the theoretical treatment of weak interaction process in ( 3 ) follows the rarita - schwinger @xcite formalism and the @xmath83 transition form factors are introduced following a notation due to adler @xcite and llewellyn smith @xcite .",

    "the @xmath94 are the so - called adler form - factors @xcite .",
    "these form factors can be related to the helicity amplitudes through calculation of @xmath95 projected in different polarizations .",

    "form - factors calculated here are shown in figs .",
    "let us first start with the vector amplitudes . in the su(6 )",
    "symmetry limit @xcite , @xmath149 the fermi - watson theorem implies these multipoles to be purely imaginary on top of the delta resonance .",
    "thus , @xmath150 in the qm , all amplitudes are purely real , hence e2/m1=0 in the su(6 ) limit , giving @xmath151 using this relation in eq.(53 ) , we get , in the su(6 ) symmetry limit , the largest vector form factor , c@xmath152 , given by ( table [ key2 ] ) @xmath153 also , the left - hand side of ( 54 ) vanishes in the su(6 ) limit , giving @xmath154 likewise , we can get @xmath155 finally , the longitudinal vector response vanishes in the su(6 ) limit : @xmath156 thus , the only non - vanishing multipole vector amplitude in the su(6 ) limit is the magnetic dipole amplitude , given by @xmath157 we can similarly discuss the axial vector amplitude in the su(6 ) limit .",

    "limit , this ratio should be unity for both v and a currents .",
    "the deviation from unity is due to the su(6 ) breaking interactions . in the ik case , that is from the color hyperfine interaction .    the su(6 ) relations described above are only approximate , since the su(6 ) symmetry is broken by the color hyperfine interaction .",
    "thus , the ik model wave functions and the actual experiments would violate these relations .",
    "the degree of these violations is an interesting question and lots of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention are being given to it , since the finding of davidson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that the emr is not zero from the existing old electromagnetic data .",
    "we hope our study here of the axial vector amplitudes would trigger similar interest in the _",
    "weak sector_.    we note that the su(6 ) symmetry limit to the nucleon and the delta wave function provides consistency with the requirements of cvc .",
    "thus , the cvc requirement of current conservation is trivially satisfied .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath168 , required by the cvc limit , is again trivially true .",
    "the cac relation ( 62 ) is _ not _ satisfied in the su(6 ) limit .",
    "however , we get good agreement with the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation , eq.(69 ) .",
    "thus , going to the `` real photon '' point @xmath169 , we can evaluate the @xmath170 by using ( 84 ) .",
    "we get @xmath171 compared with the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman value of 1.2 , a good agreement .",
    "we can also see that the identity ( 62 ) is satisfied in the su(6 ) limit of qm , as it must",
    ". however , both sides are quite large at the real photon point : @xmath172 instead of the pcac expectation of both - sides of ( 62 ) vanishing at the chiral limit , eq.(62 ) .",
    "an extensive review of the old qm calculations by many authors has been done by schreiner and von hippel @xcite , who have provided a detailed comparison between theory and experiment , as available till 1973 .",
    "the readers are referred to their paper for a discussion . in table",
    "[ key4 ] , we summarize the predictions of various form factors , vector and axial vector , in different models , and compare them with the new qm results reported here , as well as the recent estimates of hemmert _ et al._@xcite .      we have seen earlier that the quantity @xmath173 , the left - hand side of eq . (",
    "55 ) , vanishes in the su(6 ) limit , thereby satisfying the cvc .",
    "other quark model wave functions for the nucleon and the delta , such as those of the isgur - karl model and the vbj model @xcite , discussed below , do not satisfy this cvc constraint @xcite .",
    "the cvc violations in the ik and vbj models are demonstrated in figs . 5 and 6 where the @xmath174 and the @xmath168 are plotted as functions of @xmath175 for w=1230mev and w=1234mev .",
    "as noted earlier , the pcac pion pole estimate of @xmath176 eq.(66 ) , is not fulfilled in the qm .",
    "the ik quark model , for example , produces a value of @xmath177 _ much smaller _ than what eq.(66 ) suggests .",
    "this failure is readily understandable , because the inclusion of the pion - pole term in a qm that involves only quark degrees of freedom _ and no mesons _ , is not legitimate .",
    "however , what is surprising is that the _ off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation _ ( eq.(69 ) ) _ is well - satisfied in the su(6 ) limit and by the ik quark model wave functions . _",
    "thus , in the su(6 ) limit , we have eq.(87 ) ; in the ik model , we get _  _ @xmath178 this , however , occurs due to an accident . in the chiral limit @xmath179 in eq.(64 ) , and @xmath180 would pick up a pcac contribution , not present in our qm calculations . the latter does not satisfy the chiral axial current conservation and does not pick up the pcac contribution in @xmath180 .",
    "however , these two theoretical inaccuracies somehow add up to the pcac estimate in our su(6 ) and ik quark model wave functions . further theoretical work is needed to illuminate the nature of this happy accident .    while the degree of violation of cvc and pcac should be as small as possible in the quark model of excellent quality",
    ", this does not mean we prefer the su(6 ) limit to the ik model .",
    "that is because the color hyperfine interaction and other dynamical considerations make the su(6 ) limit inaccurate for baryon spectroscopy .",
    "we must , therefore , search for a model beyond that limit . between the ik model and the vbj models ,",
    "the former is clearly superior , as the violation of cvc is less in the former than in the latter , and the ik model account for the baryon spectroscopy , while the vbj model is not so ambitious .",
    "we can go back to figs . 1 and 2 to demonstrate the su(6 )",
    "breakings in the ik @xcite and vbj @xcite models .",
    "these effects are significant , though difficult to measure experimentally . in figs .",
    "3 and 9 , the su(6 ) limits coincide with the theoretical predictions of cvc and off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation . here",
    ", more realistic quark models produce mild violation of these important constraints .",
    "such violation can arise from the model truncation effects .",
    "some authors have tried to remedy these with the introduction of the form factors at the quark level @xcite .",
    "we shall not do that , as we believe this is not a satisfactory remedy in the spirit of qcd .",
    "the experiments on neutrino scattering in the delta resonance region are very difficult , nevertheless they have been done in a number of labs , anl , cern , fermilab and bnl [ 15 - 18 ] .",
    "these experiments deal with single pion production in the charged current reaction in hydrogen and deuterium . in view of the extensive literature on the older experiments , we shall focus here on the most recent one .",
    "latest experimental results @xcite come from the brookhaven national laboratory(bnl ) .",
    "the analysis by kitagaki _",

    "we also include the result of a d - state mixing model , suggested by glashow @xcite , and further discussed by vbj @xcite , bourdeau and mukhopadhyay @xmath223@xmath224 @xmath225 , and adjust @xmath226 so that the @xmath227 comes out to be the pdg recommended value .",
    "we find @xmath228 and together they give : @xmath229 the results of this model is included in table [ key4 ] and figs . 1 - 11 .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite shows that @xmath230 .",
    "this implies , in the d - state mixing model , @xmath231 . for brevity",
    ", we do not give numerical results for the helicity amplitudes for this case .",
    "the ratio @xmath233 in the @xmath234 transition has attracted a lot of attention of theorists @xcite and experimentalists @xcite alike . in analogy to this quantity , we can also define the ratio @xmath235 for the axial - vector analogue of the emr for the process ( 3 ) . in the su(6 )",
    "symmetry limit , it is zero identically .",
    "we give in fig .",
    "11 a plot of the ratio as a function of @xmath189 , keeping w fixed at the delta excitation , as computed from the qm , and compare it with the adler assumption that it is zero identically , an assumption made in the kitagaki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite analysis .",
    "it would be interesting to determine this quantity directly from the experiment in the future .",
    "we recall here that the @xmath227 , for the vector current , is not well - determined in the qm of the ik variety .",
    "while davidson _",
    "et al_. @xcite found the value for this ratio at the photon point to be @xmath236 from the pion photoproduction in the delta region .",
    "new experiments @xcite at the brookhaven legs facility have indicated this ratio to be at least _ twice _ as large .",
    "the ik quark model predicts the ratio at the photon point @xmath237 the alternative wave - functions of ik model ( isgur - karl 2 ) , given above ( eq.(105 - 106 ) ) , yield an emr of -0.0051 . thus , the emr , obtained in the ik quark model , is much smaller in magnitude compared to the phenomenological value .",
    "there are indications in the latest skyrmion approach @xcite that the emr at the photon point is indeed much larger than the prediction of the ik quark model , close to -0.05 .",
    "thus , the experimental determination of the aemr may be less difficult than what the quark model suggests , as the latter may turn out to be a gross underestimate .",
    "this quantity should be computed in the soliton models .    while we are on the subject of the emr and aemr , we should make some remarks about the issue of the behavior of these ratios as functions of @xmath189 , a very topical question . in the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd )",
    "@xcite , these ratios must approach unity , as @xmath238 : @xmath239 while in the ik model , these behave as follows : @xmath240 @xmath241 the last two equations are , of course , meaningless at large @xmath189 ( that is , large @xmath242 ) .",
    "we are giving the last two equations merely to indicate very different limits for the emr and aemr , at large @xmath243 in the ik quark model , compared with pqcd .",
    "nevertheless , it is amusing to note that the ik quark model reproduces the signs and rough orders of magnitudes of the pqcd limits mentioned above .",
    "several questions are important here : ( 1 ) do the emr and aemr approach unity for large @xmath189 attainable in the laboratory ? if the answer is yes , at what @xmath244 ? ( 2 ) where does the ik - type quark model predictions definitely break down ?",
    "( 3 ) what happens to the bloom - gilman duality @xcite in the axial vector sector , on which we have no experimental information ? future research should focus on these issues .",
    "we may add here that there is a strong debate in the literature on the question ( 1 ) .",
    "the pqcd `` believers '' @xcite tend to see the asymptopia at hand at @xmath245 , while the `` non - believers '' @xcite argue that the @xmath189 value for the pqcd rules to be valid is too large for us to worry , at the `` modest '' q@xmath190 currently available .",
    "previous to our work , many authors have investigated the neutrino excitation of the delta resonance off nucleons , but all in the context of the su(6 ) symmetric quark model @xcite .",
    "schreiner and von hippel @xcite have reviewed most of these attempts . among the later works",
    ", mention may be made of the work of abdullah and close @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the cvc condition is imposed , also , quark structure functions are introduced , and the quark form factors are treated as constants . in the work by andreadis _",
    "et al_. @xcite , again in the su(6 ) limit , quark form factors are introduced .",
    "we do not use form factors at the quark level for the following reason : ( 1 ) we want to test quark model predictions rather than fitting a constituent - quark form - factor .",
    "( 2 ) we believe that the effects of the gluons and sea - quarks have already been absorbed in the effective potential of isgur - karl quark model . ( 3 ) our results _ without _ the form - factor is very good compared to the currently available experiments .",
    "thus , there is no phenomenological reason to introduce quark form factors .",
    "( 4 ) introduction of quark - level form factors would complicate even more the relationship of the quark model to qcd .",
    "as it is , this relationship is far from clear .",
    "finally , we should discuss the difference between our approach here and a recent work by hemmert , holstein and mukhopadhyay(hhm ) @xcite dealing with the nn and n@xmath46 couplings in the quark model ( see table [ key4 ] ) . in that work , relativistic corrections to the nucleon @xmath246",
    "are taken into account and an agreement with the experimental @xmath246 for the nucleon is reached .",
    "but it yields an off - diagonal n@xmath46 axial coupling substantially lower than the experimental values .",
    "in contrast to hhm , the non - relativistic ik approach , used here , does not have the relativistic correction taken into account .",
    "thus , the diagonal value of @xmath246 still remains off the experimental value ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "but the off - diagonal axial vector matrix elements come out better .",
    "overall , _ the color hyperfine interaction does not remove the discrepancy between quark model estimates and experiments in either approach , when both diagonal and off - diagonal effects are computed_. thus , the problem of the quark model in simultaneously explaining diagonal _ and _ off - diagonal observables does not disappear .",
    "we have computed weak amplitudes of the @xmath248 transition in the framework of the ik quark model , thereby dealing with the effect of the color - hyperfine interactions in these amplitudes .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the deficit of the nucleon to delta ( 1232 ) magnetic dipole amplitude in the ik quark model estimate , when compared with pion photoproduction analysis @xcite , is confirmed via the vector form factor @xmath191 at @xmath249 .",
    "this deficit seems to heal around of @xmath192.25 gev@xmath190 .",
    "2 .   there is a mild violation of the cvc in the ik model .",
    "thus , the amplitude @xmath168 , which should be zero by cvc , is predicted in the ik quark model to have a small but non - zero value .",
    "the axial - vector transverse amplitudes are largely well - described in the ik model .",
    "an exception is our inability to get the pcac value of the @xmath250 this is not surprising , since we do not have explicit meson degrees of freedom .",
    "the ik model also violates axial current conservation in the chiral limit . despite this shortcoming , we are able to reproduce the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman estimate of the @xmath251 in the ik quark model .",
    "4 .   there is a simple way of parameterizing the su(6 ) breaking effects , through a relation ( eq.(56 ) ) that connects the two transverse helicity amplitudes to the adler form factor @xmath252 .",
    "the ik model gives an estimate of this small effect .",
    "its experimental verification , though indirect and difficult , should constitute an important experimental challenge , analogous to the determination of e2/m1 in the vector ( electromagnetic ) sector .",
    "hopefully , new weak interactions studies in the nucleon resonance region ( 1 - 2 gev of w ) will be possible at existing neutrino facilities .",
    "there are also new experimental possibilities at the cebaf on the weak charged and neutral current explorations [ 43 - 47 ] of the isobar physics .",
    "though these are intrinsically very difficult , there is some hope that such experiments would be possible .",
    "they would go a long way towards our understanding of the axial vector response of the nucleon , in particular .",
    "the role of the delta isobar , already important in the adler - weissberger sum - rule @xcite , would be interesting to be explored further in the nucleon to delta weak excitation domain .          c. h. albright and l. s. liu , phys .",
