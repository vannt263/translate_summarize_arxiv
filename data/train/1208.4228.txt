    "the results presented in this paper are obtained within the framework of hartree - fock based semi - empirical methods , which are well tested and reliable for the evaluation of the electronic and optical properties of c - conjugated low - dimensional systems .",
    "the am1 model @xcite is adopted for structural optimization ( 0.4 @xmath1/ threshold for the forces ) and for the study of the electronic properties , including the calculation of electric dipole moments .",
    "the electronic gap is computed as the difference between _ vertical _ ionization potential ( ip ) and electron affinity ( ea ) , which are in turn obtained from the total energy of the neutral and ( @xmath21 ) charged states , i.e. ip = e(+1 ) - e(0 ) and ea = e(0 ) - e(-1 ) .",
    "the optical spectra are evaluated by means of the zindo / s model @xcite , with single excitation configuration interaction ( cis ) .",
    "our convergence tests over the number of occupied and virtual molecular orbitals ( mos ) indicated that a ci energy window of at least 4.5 ev below the homo and 3.5 ev above the lumo is required for a reliable characterization of the low energy optical excitations .",
    "axis ) and variable width ( @xmath3 axis ) , chosen as representative of the three different families of agnfs , i.e. @xmath4=@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "edge functionalization is performed by replacing each second h atom along the length with a foreign substituent .",
    "two functionalization schemes can be identified : the a - a scheme , where the same zigzag line is functionalized on both edges , and the a - b scheme , where functionalization involves alternating zigzag lines . indicated are the point symmetry groups of each structure , clean ( black ) , and functionalized in the a - a ( red ) and a - b ( blue ) scheme , respectively , for ideal ( non - distorted and symmetrically terminated ) flakes . ]",
    "we perform our analysis on elongated graphene nanoflakes ( gnfs ) with armchair - shaped edges , which can be seen as finite portions of graphene nanoribbons . as for infinite ribbons ,",
    "we introduce a width parameter @xmath4 , corresponding to the number of dimeric c lines across the @xmath3 axis ( see [ fig1]a ) . according to their width parameter @xmath4 , both ribbons @xcite and flakes @xcite present three scaling laws for the energy gap , also in presence of edge substituents .",
    "this allows us to classify them into three different families , following a _ modulo 3 _ periodic law : @xmath8 , with @xmath9 integer and @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "we will mainly focus on a @xmath11 gnf ( width @xmath12 7.3  ) of length @xmath12 24  ( @xmath13 axis , see [ fig1]a ) .",
    "we will then extend our analysis to the family dependence by considering two additional structures ( shown in [ fig1]b - c ) , having widths 8.6  ( @xmath4=8 ) and 9.8  ( @xmath4=9 ) and fixed length .",
    "for each structure , the lateral ends along the @xmath13 axis are shaped in such a way to minimize the influence of zigzag edges , which are known to affect the electronic properties of the system @xcite .",
    "= 7 and @xmath4=8 agnfs , functionalizalized with ( left ) and ( right ) groups , according to the a - a and a - b schemes .",
    "the angle @xmath14 is introduced to quantify the distortion angle , defined as the maximum deviation from planarity of edge c atoms . ]    the effects of edge substituents on the electronic and optical properties of gnfs are investigated for a number of light - element metal - free functional groups , including atoms and molecular groups typically involved in electrophilic aromatic substitutions @xcite .",
    "we group these terminations into three main classes , with respect to the nature of their covalent bond with the graphene edge : the first class comprises monovalent halogen terminations ( f , cl and br ) ; the second consists of groups forming a direct bond at the edge , in which either n or o shares a @xmath15 lone pair with the edge c atom ( , and ) ; as a third class , we finally consider small moieties bonded to the gnf through a c - bond and including a c - double bond , which allows to extend the c - conjugation of the graphene backbone for one additional bond length beyond the edge ( , and ) . the choice of these terminations is basically motivated by their experimental feasibility in systems similar to those investigated here .",
    "edge covalent functionalization is here performed by replacing each second h atom passivating the armchair edges in the reference system , through the regular alternation of substituents . as indicated in [ fig1 ] ,",
    "two functionalization schemes can be designed : in the a - a scheme the same c zigzag line is functionalized on opposite edges , while in the a - b scheme alternating c zigzag lines are functionalized .",
    "in addition , full substitution , i.e. functionalization of all c edge atoms , is considered for monoatomic halogen terminations only , as justified by their reduced size .",
    "note that , depending on the chosen scheme and on the flake width , each structure has different symmetry .",
    "h - terminated flakes have d@xmath16 ( c@xmath16 ) symmetry for @xmath4 odd ( even ) , which is modified by the presence of functional groups at the edges . for @xmath4 odd ,",
    "the a - a scheme results in a c@xmath17 symmetry , while in the a - b scheme the symmetry is c@xmath16 . on the contrary , for @xmath4",
    "even the symmetry is preserved as c@xmath16 in the a - a scheme and lowered to c@xmath18 in the a - b scheme . even though this classification is formally correct only for ideal non - distorted and symmetrically terminated structures , since the symmetry",
    "is always lowered upon structural optimization , we will keep this notation throughout the paper for convenience .",
    "edge covalent functionalization is known to be an effective strategy to tune the electronic gap of graphene nanostructures . as suggested already for simple aromatic compounds ,",
    "the presence of edge functional groups modifies the electronic distribution within the graphene network in the edge proximity . as a consequence , heterospecies with different electronegativity",
    "than c and covalently bonded at the edges of a graphene ribbon allow to modify the ionization potential ( ip ) and the electron affinity ( ea ) of the system with respect to the reference h - passivated flake @xcite .",
    "the optical characteristics are then directly affected @xcite .",
    "however , the edge - decoration of the flakes induces also structural modifications , which are closely related and interdependent with the electronic stabilization , as we will see in the following .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that , depending on the value of @xmath4 ( even or odd ) , the type of substituent and the functionalization scheme ( a - b or a - a ) , different types of distortions can arise , either localized at the edges or extended to the flake backbone .",
    "for instance , for we have a typical case of structural modifications mostly localized at the edges : there is a slight difference for different @xmath4 and scheme , however there are no global , coherent modifications . in this case ,",
    "local steric effects among the functional groups play a primary role in driving distortions : groups , which can reorient to minimize the repulsion , induce relatively small tilt of edge c rings to opposite directions , perpendicular to the flake basal plane ( @xmath19 axis , see [ fig2 ] ) . as a second example",
    ", we highlight the case of the termination : here the interplay of functionalization pattern , group rigidity and steric effects can produce coherent distortions involving the whole flake backbone , which thus stabilize the structure .",
    "this is evident for @xmath4=7 ( @xmath4=8 ) in the a - a ( a - b ) scheme ( [ fig2 ] ) , where the system tends to twist along its longitudinal axis ( x ) . for @xmath4=8 in the a - a scheme , a `` rippling '' mode tends also to appear on top of the local distortions induced at the edges .    to quantify these effects",
    ", we introduce an angle @xmath14 , defined as the maximum deviation of edge c atoms with respect to the reference planar configuration ( h - gnf , @xmath14=0 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath14 for different functional groups are reported in [ table2 ] for @xmath4=7 gnfs ( see supporting information for @xmath4=8 and @xmath4=9 , table s3 ) . in the case of halogen termination , similar distortion angles are observed for both a - a and a - b schemes , while a significantly larger tilting angle is produced upon full functionalization . for molecular substituents , where larger distortions are expected in view of their size , the tilt of edge c - rings is considerably reduced when the groups are relatively free to rearrange , as we described for .",
    "this is also the case of methoxy ( ) and groups , where the flexible o - linkage allows them to assume an ordered alignment ( see supporting information , figure s1 ) . on the contrary , larger @xmath14 angles ( and global distortions ) are noticed for rigid groups like and ethene units ( and .",
    "we remark finally that , even when we find discernible structural modifications , they do not result in any significant local deviation from the regular graphene bonding and no strongly localized defects appear . for further structural details ( edge c - c and c - substituent bond lengths ) , see supporting information , table s1-s2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         we next inspect the role of the chemical specificities of edge substituents , by comparing the optical spectra of @xmath4=7 gnfs functionalized with all the anchoring groups considered in this work , as shown in [ fig5 ] .",
    "we here consider only the a - b pattern , since negligible differences are observed between the two schemes for most of the substituents ( see figure s3 in the supporting information for more details ) .",
    "the analysis of fully halogen terminated gnfs is also included in the supporting information ( see figure s4 and table s8 ) .",
    "a non rigid red shift of the spectra is generally observed upon functionalization , with a larger red shift for p1 than for p2 .",
    "all the spectra of the groups anchored through a direct bond ( [ fig5]b ) display the same key feature already discussed for the amino termination and reported in [ fig4]b : an additional distinct peak emerges , corresponding to the p0 excitation which becomes optically active .",
    "this effect is also present , even though less intense , for halogen terminations : p0 appears as a shoulder in the main p1 peak for fluorinated flakes ( [ fig5]a ) . in the case of c - bonded molecular substituents ,",
    "the impact of functionalization on the electronic states is further reduced , so that the main spectral features are basically preserved with respect to the flat h - terminated flake ( see spectra in [ fig5]b and the composition of the main excitations in [ table4 ] ) .        in order to complete our analysis",
    ", we finally investigate the spectra of the gnfs of width parameter @xmath20 and @xmath21 , functionalized with one prototypical group per class , namely f , and , according to the higher symmetry scheme ( a - a for @xmath4=8 and a - b for @xmath4=9 ) .",
    "the optical spectra computed for these systems are shown in [ fig6 ] , with the reference spectrum of the corresponding planar h - gnf reported in the background of each panel ( grey shaded area ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the @xmath4=8 gnf is dominated by a first intense peak p1 , which is about 1 ev lower in energy compared to those of the other gnf families ( compare [ fig6]a with [ fig5 ] and [ fig6]b ) , in agreement with the trend for the electronic gaps @xcite .",
    "contrary to @xmath227 , this is always the lowest energy excitation , regardless the edge termination ( see supporting information , table s5 ) .",
    "moreover , we do not observe any functionalization - induced modification in the @xmath23 distribution of frontier orbitals , since the molecular symmetry remains the same in the a - a scheme ( c@xmath16 ) . in this case",
    "the main effect of functionalization is thus to red shift the spectrum with respect to the reference h - gnf , in an almost rigid fashion ( up to over 200 mev upon amino termination ) .",
    "on the other hand , the optical spectra of @xmath4=9 gnfs manifest more similarities with those of @xmath4=7 gnfs ( see [ fig6]b and [ fig5 ] for comparison ) , both in the spectral shape and in the composition of the main excitations ( see supporting information , table s6 ) . also for the ribbons belonging to the @xmath4=3@xmath9 family , the p0 excitations becomes optically active , giving rise to a distinct peak in presence of functional groups , according to the mechanism described for the @xmath4=7 gnfs .",
    "the lowest energy peak is red shifted by about 300 mev upon amino substitution , compared to the reference h - gnf . in presence of other edge substituents ( f and ) , the energy of p1 is basically unaffected , while p2 is red shifted of about 200 mev upon each termination ( see [ fig6]b ) .",
    "this is an effect of the mo distribution observed for the gnfs belonging to this family , for which the frontier orbitals present reversed orientation of the @xmath23 distribution with respect to the flakes of the @xmath4=3@xmath9 + 1 family ( see figure s2 ) .",
    "we have analyzed in details the effects of edge covalent functionalization on the structural , electronic and optical properties of armchair graphene nanoflakes .",
    "different functionalization groups and patterns have been discussed for a specific flake , and the analysis extended and rationalized for additional systems , according to the armchair width modulation .",
    "our results indicate that steric repulsion among substituents generally determines local distortion at the edges , even though structural modifications can involve the whole flake backbone in specific cases .",
    "functionalization - induced distortions are found to play an effective role in the electronic gap reduction experienced by the flakes , with contributions ranging from 35 to 55@xmath0 of the total gap decrease .",
    "depending on the functionalization pattern and the character of the substituents , interesting charge - redistribution effects are seen for the frontier orbitals , either related to the modified molecular symmetry or to the appearance of a large longitudinal dipole component .",
    "all these effects are reflected in the optical spectra : distortions largely contribute to the lowering of the optical gap ( up to 300 mev ) , while the appearance of an additional peak at low energy is related to the distribution and the characteristics of the functional groups .",
    "our results indicate that the interplay among the system symmetry , the chemical features and the distribution of the substituents , as well as the resulting structural distortions is crucial to understand the modification of the opto - electronic properties of functionalized graphene nanoflakes .",
    "the authors are grateful to stefano corni for fruitful discussion and acknowledge cineca for computational support .",

    "m.  j.  c.   acknowledges support from fapesp and cnpq ( brazil ) .",
    "the supporting information is organized in three sections . in the first one we report the structural details ( bond lengths and distortion angles ) of the optimized @xmath4=7 , @xmath4=8 and @xmath4=9 graphene nanoflakes , to complete the data reported in the main text .",
    "the second section supports the analysis on the electronic properties , including a table with the dipole moment components of @xmath4=8 and @xmath4=9 gnfs ( functionalized according to both a - a and a - b schemes ) and the isosurfaces of the frontier orbitals for the considered systems .",
    "the last part is dedicated to optical properties .",
    "the analysis on the effects related to different functionalization schemes and structural distortions are extended here also to and f terminations , as representatives of the classes of c - bonded and halogen substituents .",

    "<S> the effects of edge covalent functionalization on the structural , electronic and optical properties of elongated armchair graphene nanoflakes ( agnfs ) are analyzed in detail for a wide range of terminations , within the framework of hartree - fock - based semi - empirical methods . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical features of the functional groups , their distribution and the resulting system symmetry are identified as the key factors that determine the modification of structural and optoelectronic features . while the electronic gap is always reduced in presence of substituents , </S>",
    "<S> functionalization - induced distortions contribute to the observed lowering by about 35 - 55@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is paired with a red shift of the first optical peak , corresponding to about 75@xmath0 of the total optical gap reduction . </S>",
    "<S> further , the functionalization pattern and the specific features of the edge - substituent bond are found to influence the strength and the character of the low energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects are discussed for flakes of different width , representing the three families of agnfs .    </S>",
    "<S> * keywords * : zindo , am1 , substitution , uv - vis spectrum , graphene nanoribbons , configuration interaction    the electronic @xcite , optical @xcite and magnetic properties @xcite of graphene nanoribbons are closely related to their edge morphology and indeed several theoretical proposals have been advanced to tune the properties of these systems through edge modifications . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the termination of edge c atoms with different groups @xcite and the introduction of magnetic impurities @xcite at the edges of zigzag graphene nanoribbons represent promising routes to fully exploit their potential for spintronics applications . in armchair graphene nanoribbons ( agnrs ) , on top of the intrinsic tunability given by the well - established family behavior @xcite , edge modifications can further engineer the energy gap and work function @xcite , as well as their optical response @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an additional aspect of edge modifications is related to the appearance of structural distortions : ripples and twists can arise , either localized at the edge region @xcite or extended to the whole structure , with effects on a larger scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the study of structural modifications has drawn itself great attention , since they can lead to a futher tuning of the graphene nanostructure properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here focus on unraveling the effects of functionalization - induced structural , electronic and optical modifications , considering not only the functional group itself but also the functionalization pattern </S>",
    "<S> . such analysis can be particularly relevant to design new optoelectronic functionalities in graphene nanostructures , above all in light of the recent improvements in their controlled synthesis at the nanoscale @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we carry out our analysis on short armchair graphene ribbons functionalized with different edge - substituents , ranging from single atoms to small molecular moieties . </S>",
    "<S> family - dependence is also taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we recognize that several factors including the system symmetry , the chemical features of the functional groups and their distribution are responsible for the appearance of different structural and optoelectronic modifications . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the steric hindrance of substituents is found to induce local distortions at the edges , but global effects involving the flake backbone can also arise in specific cases . these structural modifications are found to reduce the electronic gap up to 300 mev , corresponding to 55@xmath0 of the total gap decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is associated to a similar red - shift of the first optical peak . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand the chemical features of the substituents and their arrangement at the edges crucially influence the distribution of the frontier orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> local variations arise as a consequence of the modified molecular symmetry upon edge functionalization , while global localization effects are noticed when a large longitudinal dipole component is introduced by polar substituents . moreover , such charge redistribution results in the appearance of an additional peak in the low energy region of the spectra , related to the optical activation of an otherwise dark excitation . </S>"
