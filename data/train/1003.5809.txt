    "previous numerical studies of the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice@xcite suggested that a single quantum phase transition separates the paramagnetic weak - coupling sm phase from a strong - coupling antiferromagnetic ( af ) mi . at strong enough repulsion , antiferromagnetism is certainly possible since the honeycomb lattice is bipartite , so that af order is not geometrically frustrated .",
    "however , the honeycomb lattice has the smallest coordination number in two dimensions , such that the effect of quantum fluctuations is the strongest .",
    "hence , the competition between the tendency to order and quantum fluctuations requires a detailed analysis of correlations and a careful extrapolation to the tdl in order to characterize the possible phases . here , we present results based on projective ( temperature @xmath2 ) determinantal qmc simulations in the canonical ensemble at half - filling . in order to assess the above scenarios , we focus in particular on the region near the mott transition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath1 hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice equals @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator for fermions of spin @xmath6 on lattice site @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 denotes the nearest - neighbour hopping amplitude , and @xmath10 the strength of the onsite repulsion .",
    "our notations in real and momentum space are shown in the inset of fig .  1 .",
    "at @xmath11 , the tight - binding hamiltonian has a linear dispersion near the dirac points ( @xmath12 , @xmath13  cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) , where the conduction and valence bands touch at half - filling , corresponding to a density @xmath14 . at half - filling",
    ", the finite-@xmath15 region can be studied using projective qmc to obtain ground - state expectation values of any physical observable .",
    "details are relegated to the methods section .",
    "the phases described in the following correspond to extrapolations to the tdl . for that purpose",
    "we study lattices of @xmath16 sites with periodic boundary conditions , and linear sizes up to @xmath17 .    to monitor the electronic properties of the system upon increasing @xmath15",
    ", we extracted the single - particle excitation gap @xmath18 from the imaginary - time displaced green s function ( cf .",
    "supplementary information ( si ) for details ) .",
    "@xmath18 gives the minimal energy necessary to extract one fermion from the system , and corresponds to the gap that can be observed in photoemission experiments .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , @xmath19 for @xmath20 below about 3.5 , as expected for a sm .",
    "for larger @xmath20 , the system enters into an insulating phase due to interactions .",
    "the values of the gap are obtained via an extrapolation of the qmc data to the tdl as shown in fig .",
    "2a .    from previous analysis of the model ,",
    "one expects long - range af correlations when the mi appears .",
    "we therefore measured the af spin structure factor @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "si ) that reveals long - range af order if @xmath22 .",
    "figure 2b shows the qmc results together with a finite size extrapolation .",
    "the results of the latter are also presented in the phase diagram of fig .  1 .",
    "af order appears beyond @xmath23 , a value that is consistent with previous estimates for the onset of long - ranged af order@xcite .",
    "this leaves an extended window @xmath24 , within which the system is neither a sm , nor an af mi .",
    "further details on the nature of this intermediate region are obtained by examining the spin excitation gap , extracted from the long - time behaviour of the imaginary - time displaced spin - spin correlation function ( cf .",
    "we consider first the spin gap @xmath25 in the staggered sector at @xmath26 , which vanishes inside the af phase due to the emergence of two goldstone modes , as well as in the gapless sm phase .",
    "figure 2c shows finite size estimates of @xmath25 for different values of @xmath20 , along with an extrapolation to the tdl .",
    "a finite value of @xmath25 persists within an intermediate parameter regime @xmath27 , while it vanishes both within the sm and the af phase .",
    "this dome in the spin gap is also seen in the inset of fig .",
    "2c , that displays both the finite - size data and the extrapolated values of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "we also calculated the uniform spin gap @xmath28 by extrapolating the spin gap observed at the smallest finite @xmath29-vector on each cluster to the tdl .",
    "@xmath28 is found to be even larger than @xmath25 inside the intermediate region ( e.g. @xmath30 ( s.e.m . ) at @xmath31 ) , and vanishes in the sm and the af phase ( @xmath28 can not be measured directly at @xmath32 , because the uniform magnetization is a conserved quantity , cf .",
    "hence , this intermediate insulating region corresponds to a spin - gap phase .    from analysing the @xmath15-dependence of the kinetic energy density , @xmath33 , we obtain further insight into these different regimes and the emergence of local moments . as shown in fig",
    ".  3 , the curvature @xmath34 changes sign near @xmath23 .",
    "this marks a characteristic change from the weak - coupling region of positive curvature with delocalized electrons to the strong - coupling af region with negative curvature . in the latter region ,",
    "localized spins form and order in an af state . in the intermediate spin - gap region , fluctuations are large enough to still prevent the formation of well - localized magnetic moments .",
    "note , that around @xmath35 , a change in the curvature can be observed , that adds to the already presented evidence for an intermediate phase .",
    "the observation of a finite spin gap rules out a gapless spin - liquid@xcite , quantum spin hall states@xcite , as well as triplet superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the remaining possibilities can be enumerated by considering the coupling to order parameters that lead to the opening of a mass gap in dirac fermions@xcite , and hence account for the single - particle gap observed in the qmc data : ( i ) singlet superconductivity , ( ii ) a quantum hall state ( qhs)@xcite , ( iii ) charge density wave ( cdw ) order@xcite and ( iv ) a valence bond crystal ( vbc ) .    in order to assess",
    "if superconductivity arises in the vicinity of the mott transition , we used the method of flux quantisation which probes the superfluid density and is hence independent of the specific symmetry of the pair wave function@xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be a magnetic flux traversing the centre of a torus on which the electronic system lies and @xmath37 the total ground - state energy , @xmath38 being the flux quantum .",
    "a superconducting state of cooper pairs is present if in the tdl , the macroscopic energy difference @xmath39 is a function with period @xmath40@xcite .",
    "in contrast , a metallic phase is characterized by @xmath41 vanishing as a power law as a function of system size , while in an insulating phase , it would vanish exponentially . as shown in the si ,",
    "this quantity vanishes in the tdl both in the semi - metallic state at @xmath11 and at @xmath31 , i.e. in the intermediate phase .",
    "in addition , we measured pair correlations , ruling out superconductivity in ( extended ) @xmath42- , @xmath43- , @xmath44- , and @xmath45-wave channels ( cf .",
    "si ) . hence , both flux quantization as well as a direct measurement of pair correlations lead to no sign of superconductivity .    both the cdw and qhs trigger a breaking of the sub - lattice symmetry and thereby open a mass gap at the mean - field level .",
    "a detailed analysis of the charge - charge correlation functions rules out a cdw .",
    "furthermore , we find no signature for the presence of ( spin ) currents in the ground - state ( cf .",
    "this rules out the breaking of sublattice and time reversal symmetries , as required for the qhs , in the pristine hubbard model , and possibly , extensions of it are necessary to reach such a state@xcite .    to examine the occurrence of a vbc , we probed for dimer - dimer correlations between separated dimers formed by nearest neighbour bonds @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( cf .",
    "we find no vbc , neither in the charge , nor in the spin sector .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of this measurement in the spin sector , i.e.  the correlation between singlet dimers at @xmath48 .",
    "the striped bond is the one with respect to which correlations were determined .",
    "they are found to be short - ranged , and consistent with the dominance of a rvb state within the hexagons of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the singlet - correlations with those of an isolated hexagon ( inset fig .",
    "4 ) , the classical example of the resonance phenomenon in conjugated @xmath49-electrons@xcite .",
    "accordingly , we find no long - ranged order from the dimer - dimer structure factors in fourier space .",
    "our results thus reveal a genuinely exotic state of matter , where no spontaneous symmetry breaking is observed , while a spin - gap is present .",
    "it corresponds to a spin - liquid rvb state in the intermediate coupling regime in the vicinity of the mott transition .",
    "the qmc results presented above uncover the realization of a quantum spin - liquid state of correlated fermions on a non - frustrated , bipartite lattice . in principle , such quantum - disordered states can occur in different flavors , and we thus aim to shed further light on the nature of the spin - liquid observed above .",
    "gapless ( algebraic ) spin - liquids , or long - range rvb states are characterized by critical spin - spin correlations@xcite .",
    "the observation of a finite spin - gap clearly excludes such candidate states , while being consistent with the characterization of the observed spin - liquid in terms of short - range rvb states@xcite , also in accordance with the observed short - ranged dimer - dimer correlations .",
    "short - range rvb states are modeled in general by quantum dimer models@xcite , which capture the fluctuations of singlets in a rvb state , with dimers being a strong - coupling representation of nearest - neighbour singlets@xcite .",
    "depending on the lattice geometry , quantum dimer models can exhibit a fully gapped short - range rvb phase , as e.g. on the triangular lattice@xcite , but also exhibit spin liquid states with gapless excitations , as is the case for bipartite lattices at the rokhsar - kivelson point@xcite and within the u(1 ) spin - liquid phase stabilized for spatial dimensions @xmath50@xcite . in the later case ,",
    "gapless singlet excitations constitute an emerging `` photon '' soft mode .",
    "fully gapped phases of quantum dimer models are furthermore characterized by a non - trivial topological order , implying e.g.  an emerging ground - state degeneracy of two - dimensional systems with periodic boundary conditions in the tdl@xcite .    in order to assess ,",
    "whether topological order can characterize the short - range rvb in our case , we examine the low - energy singlet excitations .",
    "as proven in an exact theorem by lieb@xcite , the finite systems used in our numerical simulations have a non - degenerate singlet ground - state for any finite value of @xmath51 .",
    "hence , degeneracy can only appear in the tdl .",
    "if so , low - energy singlet states should be present , with decreasing excitation energy as the system size increases .",
    "since our qmc method projects out the finite system s ground - state from a singlet trial wavefunction , we can monitor the expectation value of the internal energy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the projection parameter ( cf .",
    "methods ) . here",
    "all contributions from singlet states with the same quantum numbers as the ground - state are included , that have a finite overlap with the trial wave function . for a given system of size @xmath54",
    ", we define @xmath55 as the value of the projection parameter , such that @xmath56 , for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the ground - state energy , and @xmath59 is an energy scale which we choose small enough , in order to guarantee that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the lowest singlet excited state above the ground - state . typically , we choose @xmath59 of the order of our statistical error in the energy density . then , @xmath62 is a lower bound for the lowest singlet excitation ( cf .",
    "such an analysis on various lattice sizes leads to the conclusion , that the singlet excitation gap stays above the spin gap in the tdl ( cf .",
    "si ) , providing no evidence for the emergence of a topological state .",
    "however , we can not definitely exclude topological order , if the relevant singlet states happen to have a vanishing overlap with our trial wave function .",
    "for the future , it will be interesting to explore the low - energy singlets beyond the projective scheme , and probe for soft modes similarly as does e.g. the construction of finite momentum trial states in quantum dimer models  @xcite .",
    "our findings , based on a controlled numerical framework , therefore open a new facet of quantum spin - liquids , where an appreciable amount of doubly - occupied sites are present , extending well beyond the regime of localized spin physics .",
    "the presence of a spin - liquid in the hubbard model on the bipartite honeycomb lattice close to an antiferromagnetic mott insulator resembles the situation in the organic antiferromagnet @xmath63 , which has been argued to display a spin - liquid state@xcite , albeit the latter system is on a triangular lattice and hence frustrated .",
    "this difference can be reconciled starting from the strong - coupling limit of the hubbard model , i.e.  a nearest - neighbour heisenberg model , that close to the mott transition acquires corrections that induce efficient frustrations to the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , a klein hamiltonian for a spin - liquid state on the honeycomb lattice was constructed , including extended exchange interactions@xcite .",
    "a more pronounced difference is the appearance of superconductivity in the organic systems upon pressure , that is equivalent to a reduction of the ratio @xmath20 in the hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the absence of superconductivity in our system could be due to the vanishing density of states at the fermi energy . in this case , a finite coupling strength is needed , at least in the bcs - frame@xcite .",
    "however , having an unexpected realisation of a short - range rvb state , it would be highly interesting to explore the consequences of doping , in a spirit rather close to the original scenario proposed by anderson@xcite and kivelson _ _ et al.__@xcite for the cuprates .",
    "in particular , for the fully gapped short - range rvb state , the finite spin - gap sets the energy scale of pairing in the superconducting state@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the value obtained for the spin - gap is rather promising .",
    "the largest value attained is @xmath64 ( fig .  1 ) , that for @xmath9 in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 ev ( in graphene is @xmath65 ev@xcite ) corresponds to a temperature scale ranging from 400 to 700 k.    although studies of doping are beyond the power of our quantum monte carlo approach due to the sign problem , they could open interesting perspectives e.g.  in future experiments with ultra - cold atoms on a honeycomb optical lattice , or with honeycomb lattices based on group iv elements like expanded graphene ( to enhance the ratio @xmath20 ) or si , where the nearest neighbour distance is expected to be approximately 50% larger than in graphene@xcite , such that correlations effects are enhanced .",
    "in fact , first attempts succeeded in synthesizing single - crystal silicon monolayers@xcite .    at half - filling , the finite-@xmath15 region can be studied using the determinantal projective qmc algorithm to obtain ground - state expectation values of a physical observable by performing an imaginary time evolution of a trial wave function that is required to be nonorthogonal to the ground - state .",
    "the value @xmath53 reached in the imaginary time evolution corresponds to a projection parameter@xcite . for a spin - singlet trial wave function",
    ", we found @xmath66 to be sufficient to obtain converged ground - state quantities within statistical uncertainty .",
    "in the presented simulations , we used a finite imaginary time step @xmath67 .",
    "we verified by extrapolating @xmath68 that this finite imaginary time step produces no artifacts .",
    "simulations were performed for systems of linear size @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 sites . for",
    "periodic boundary conditions these clusters all have nodal @xmath12-points and hence allow a smooth extrapolation to the tdl .",
    "imaginary time displaced quantities are obtained by using the approach in ref .",
