    "although it is now generally recognised that the environment experienced by the galaxies during their whole lifetime plays a role as important as the initial conditions of their formation , there are still many open questions . in order to define what is the amplitude and dispersion of a given galaxy property that can be ascribed to `` nature '' , a well characterised reference sample of isolated galaxies",
    "is needed . to be statistically useful the sample must be large enough to allow us to assess environmental effects both as a function of morphological type and luminosity . the motivation of the amiga ( * a*nalysis of the interstellar * m*edium of * i*solated * ga*laxies http://amiga.iaa.es ) project is to identify such a sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "the amiga project adopted the catalogue of isolated galaxies ( cig : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a starting point .",
    "the strength of the cig involves its size ( 1050 galaxies ) and its selection with a strong isolation criterion .",
    "previous papers in this series included : 1 ) optical characterisation including derivation of the optical luminosity function , 2 ) morphological revision using poss - ii ( and sdss overlap ) and type - specific olf analysis and 3 ) mid- and far - infrared properties using the iras database .",
    "studies of the radio continuum , , co and h@xmath1 emission properties have also been carried along with a study of the small agn population found in the sample .",
    "this work focuses on a reassessment of the isolation degree for all galaxies in the cig with recession velocities @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "by separating stars from galaxies ( based on poss - i plates ) , we were able to create a catalogue of more than 53000 neighbour galaxies , lying around the 950 cig galaxies .",
    "the catalogues are available in electronic form at the cds @xcite or from http://amiga.iaa.es . a typical star / galaxy separation parameter plane from a poss - i e image ( cig 714 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paramspace714 ] .",
    "the galaxies have a lower surface brightness than the stars and in the @xmath4(area ) vs. magnitude plane , the two classes of objects fall in different loci .",
    ") parameters for the cig and the comparison samples .",
    "the cig galaxies are represented by grey pluses .",
    "the ktg are depicted by green triangles , the hcg by magenta squares and the aco by red dots .",
    "the mean values of each sample are shown by horizontal and vertical lines , following the same colour code .",
    "the catalogues are available at the cds @xcite . ]    using the @xmath553000 neighbour galaxies , we calculated continuous parameters of isolation for 950 galaxies in the cig .",
    "we used the local number density and the tidal force estimation to precisely describe the environment of each of the 950 cig galaxies .",
    "the local number density of the neighbour galaxies is calculated by focusing on the vicinity of the isolated galaxy candidates , where the principal perturbers should lie .",
    "an estimation of the local number density , @xmath6 , is found by considering the distance to the @xmath7 nearest neighbour . to probe a local region around the central galaxy , we consider @xmath8 equal to 5 , or less if there are not enough neighbours in the field : @xmath9 with the volume @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( in @xmath12 ) is the projected distance to the @xmath7 nearest neighbour .    in order to provide an estimation of the degree of isolation taking also into account the masses of the neighbours",
    ", we calculated the tidal strength affecting the primary cig galaxies .",
    "the tidal strength per unit mass produced by a neighbour is proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the neighbour , and @xmath15 is its distance from the centre of the primary ( @xmath16 is the extension of the object ) .",
    "we approximated @xmath15 by the projected separation , @xmath17 , at the distance of the cig galaxy .",
    "accordingly , the estimator @xmath18 is defined as the ratio between the tidal force and binding force :        figure  [ fig : cigktghcgaco ] shows the comparison between the local number density and the tidal strength estimation for the cig and the other catalogues sampling denser environments .",
    "these two isolation parameters are complementary and allow us to have a clear picture of the environment of each cig galaxy considered .",
    "we compared the level of isolation of the galaxies in the cig with galaxies in denser environments : 41 triplets ( ktg * ? ? ? * ) , 34 compact groups ( hcg * ? ? ? * ) and 15 clusters ( aco * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were selected for the comparison .",
    "the two isolation parameters are very well suited to discriminate the isolated galaxies from galaxies more affected by their environments .",
    "a more complete information can be found principally in and .",
