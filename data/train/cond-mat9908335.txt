    "topological phase transitions in two dimensions , which are induced by the proliferation of topological defects , are naturally described via coulomb gas formulations . in the description of the kosterlitz - thouless transition of the xy model ,",
    "the corresponding coulomb gas ( cg ) with integer charges is obtained as an effective theory for the topological defects of the model : the vortices @xcite .",
    "similarly , a collection of dislocations whose proliferation induce the melting transition in a two dimensional elastic lattice can be described by a coulomb gas with vector charges which belong to the reciprocal lattice@xcite .",
    "finally , most of two dimensional statistical models , such as the ising , potts and askin - teller models , can be transformed into coulomb gases @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) . in all these cases , the transitions can be studied by renormalization in considering the screened interaction between two test coulomb charges . this interaction is logarithmic at large distance @xmath0 , and the renormalization procedure consists in neglecting the higher terms in an expansion in @xmath1 as being irrelevant @xcite .",
    "this renormalization is thus valid for a dilute gas of charges , and is usually implemented by an expansion of the coulomb gas partition function in powers of the _ charge fugacity _ @xmath2 .",
    "this fugacity @xmath3 is related to the _ core energy _ @xmath4 of the charges ( i.e the local energy to create a defect or their chemical potential ) .",
    "thus this coulomb gas renormalization procedure is perturbatively controlled in the limit of large @xmath4 , or equivalently at finite temperature in the limit of small fugacity .",
    "several topological transitions in two dimensions have been successfully described using this cg technique @xcite .    soon afterwards , several authors attempted to extend these techniques to models with quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "the randomness in the original statistical models translates into random fields in the coulomb gas formulation .",
    "the averaged free energy ( instead of the partition function ) of this coulomb gas is then expanded , as in the pure case , in powers of the fugacity @xmath2 of the charges .",
    "usual scaling techniques then allow to study the topological transitions in these disordered systems",
    ".    it does not seem to have been realized at that time that these approaches rely on the crucial assumption of a _ uniform fugacity _ for the charges in the sample , or equivalently of a core energy _",
    "spatially uniform over the sample_. although this assumption is natural for pure models , it is at least questionable in the presence of a random potential @xcite .",
    "the randomness may favor the appearance of topological defects ( the charges of the cg ) in some sites where the core energy will be effectively lower than on other sites . at high temperature ,",
    "the randomness of the core energy @xmath4 is irrelevant as it is averaged out by thermal phase fluctuations . in that case",
    "the large scale behaviour of the model can indeed be described by simply considering the averaged fugacity over the sample @xmath5 , as in @xcite . however , as we show here , when the temperature is lowered , the spatial inhomogeneities in the local core energy become more and more relevant . as a result",
    ", approaches based on a single uniform fugacity are doomed to fail .",
    "a correct detailed description of the scaling behaviour of the site - dependent fugacities ( or core energies ) becomes then necessary to determine the phase diagram and describe quantitatively the transitions in the random model .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to define a novel renormalization method which allows this description in a consistent and perturbatively controlled manner .",
    "we present here a detailed analysis , a shorter account of the method and results has appeared in @xcite .",
    "although we focus here on the random phase xy model , these techniques can be applied to a much wider class of systems which can be formulated as disordered coulomb gases ( e.g. see section [ part : sinegordon ] for a random sine - gordon formulation ) . in particular , extensions to the melting of two dimensional crystals in presence of disorder are studied in @xcite and applications to the statistics of localized wave functions of electrons in random magnetic fields as well as entropic transitions in liouville theory and other models are studied in @xcite .      in this paper , we focus on the 2d xy model with randomness in the phase ( see eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) ) , originally studied in @xcite in the context of xy magnets with random dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions . the topological defects ( vortices ) of this model are represented by integer charges @xmath6 at sites @xmath0 .",
    "two charges @xmath7 interact for a large separation via the usual coulomb interaction of strength @xmath8 , with the corresponding energy @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the typical size of the core region of the vortices , _",
    "i.e _ the short distance cut - off ( as discussed in section [ part : model ] ) .",
    "these charges also couple to a random potential @xmath11 , which arises from the randomness of the xy model , via a term @xmath12 which depends on the sign of the charge .",
    "the crucial property of this random potential is that it has long range logarithmic correlations : @xmath13 the on - site variance being @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the system size .",
    "rubinstein , schraiman and nelson @xcite identified the most relevant vortices as the @xmath16 charges .",
    "they derived scaling equations for the stiffness @xmath17 , the disorder strength @xmath18 and a _ single fugacity _ for these charges @xmath19 .",
    "as in the pure case , the nature of the phase is determined by the behaviour of the fugacity : in a quasi - ordered phase , @xmath20 decreases with the scale while in a disordered phase it increases . in this last case , vortices appear at the scale @xmath21 at which their renormalized core energy @xmath22 is about zero , which corresponds to a fugacity of order @xmath23 : @xmath24 ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly the divergence of the correlation length at criticality found in @xcite , @xmath25 , is identical to the result of kosterlitz - thouless for the pure system .",
    "the phase diagram was found to be reentrant at low temperature , and is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag - intro ] as a function of the renormalized value of @xmath26 and @xmath8 .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite have proposed a modified phase diagram for the same model , where the reentrance of the phase transition of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag - intro ] disappears .",
    "the main point , further developed in @xcite , is an energy argument for a single vortex at zero temperature in a finite size sample , in the spirit of the kosterlitz - thouless argument for the transition in the pure model @xcite .",
    "the energy to create a single defect has two main components ( neglecting the bare core energy ) : the elastic energy @xmath27 and the disorder energy .",
    "indeed the defect can take advantage of the spatial variations of @xmath11 and choose the minimal value of @xmath11 in the @xmath28 sites of a sample of size @xmath15 . to estimate this minimum @xmath29 of @xmath11 over @xmath30 sites",
    ", the above authors neglected the spatial correlations of @xmath11 .",
    "under that hypothesis , the problem of this single particle in the random potential @xmath11 becomes _ identical _ to the random energy model ( rem ) defined and solved in the seminal work of derrida @xcite .",
    "in particular , the averaged @xmath31 of the minimum behaves for large @xmath30 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the onsite variance ( see above ) . adding the elastic contribution @xmath34 yields a creation energy @xmath35 .",
    "hence this simple single vortex argument points towards the existence of a topological phase transition at @xmath36 where vortices proliferate .",
    "the modified phase diagram is shown as a solid line on figure [ fig : phasediag - intro ] .",
    "although appealing , this single vortex argument is not sufficient by itself to prove the existence of a phase transition in the system of many interacting charges , and even less so to describe the critical behaviour .",
    "screening by mutual interactions usually plays an important role in coulomb systems , and screening of the disorder could also in principle modify the results .",
    "the single vortex argument can only become valid asymptotically ( at infinite scaling length ) if there indeed exists a phase with finite renormalized values for @xmath8 and @xmath26 and vanishing fugacity at zero temperature .",
    "the very existence of the xy phase in the present problem has been questionned in recent works @xcite and a further analysis is thus necessary .",
    "thus , we can not avoid the use of a renormalization approach to determine the true phase diagram .",
    "such a controlled rg description should correctly take into account the correlations of the random potential , neglected in the above argument .",
    "it should allow to precisely caracterize the universal features of the critical behaviour at the disorder driven transition .",
    "several attempts to construct a rg method were proposed @xcite prior to this work , but no agreement was found between the results of these different approaches . as we discuss below , this is largely because none of these approaches was internally consistent .",
    "in particular , they were all based on expansions in _ dipole _ fugacities while considering single charge fugacities not only appears more natural but is essential in constructing a consistent renormalization procedure . as a result",
    "these approaches missed the very important contribution of the fusion of environments ( see below ) .",
    "korshunov and nattermann started by approximating the free energy of a given disordered coulomb gas by the sum of the free energies of _ independent dipoles _ ] of charges @xcite .",
    "they found no renormalization of the disorder strength @xmath26 and a modified phase diagram in agreement with the figure [ fig : phasediag - intro ] .",
    "an interesting replica approach was developed by scheidl @xcite , with the use of a coulomb gas of @xmath37-component charges @xmath38 , where @xmath37 is the number of replica .",
    "scheidl noticed that , in the renormalization procedure , one must a priori take into account charges with a number @xmath39 of non zero components , contrarily to @xcite where only single component charges were considered .",
    "his rg equations are not compatible with the one of @xcite : since the disorder strength @xmath26 is renormalized , it leads to a different phase diagram when expressed in the bare constants . upon closer examination in section [ part : other - approaches ] and interpretation within our formalism , the assumption implicitly underlying scheidl s work @xcite appears to be the gaussian nature of the renormalized local disorder , while we are able to prove that the local disorder does not remain gaussian upon coarse - graining .",
    "although we are also able to show a posteriori that in the xy phase some results are compatible between the two approaches , the non gaussian nature of the local disorder becomes crucial to determine the critical behaviour at the transition .",
    "finally tang @xcite developed an appealing physical picture for the single vortex freezing phenomena in this model beyond the rem approximation mentionned above , and correctly foresaw the existence of a connection @xcite with the problem of the directed polymer on the cayley tree ( dpct ) .",
    "however , no precise coulomb gas renormalization procedure was developed following these ideas .",
    "finding a controlled rg procedure which allows to describe this physics of freezing in a collection of interacting coulomb charges in a random environments is thus a non trivial and challenging problem . as we will see ( and as can be expected from the above single charge argument ) , it requires a quantitative description of the scale dependence of the probability distribution of the fugacities associated with the rare sites were the charges are frozen .    before embarking in the ( sometimes technical ) remainder of the paper , it is useful to depict the spirit of the method and summarize the main results .      to capture the physics of freezing in a gas of coulomb charges we find it crucial to start by realizing that upon increasing the size of the charges ( cutoff @xmath10 ) , their core energy aquires a random component from the potential @xmath11 . increasing @xmath10 to @xmath40 , this potential @xmath11 with logarithmic correlation splits into the rescaled logarithmically correlated potential @xmath41 at scale @xmath42 , and a random part @xmath43 uncorrelated at scales larger than @xmath42 .",
    "this local potential is naturally incorporated in the ( renormalized ) core energy @xmath4 , which thus becomes random and site dependent : @xmath44 .",
    "thus , upon coarse graining , the fugacities of the @xmath45 charges of the coulomb gas become random ( and dependent on the sign of the charge ) : @xmath46 .",
    "let us stress that the definition of @xmath43 ( and thus of @xmath47 ) depends on details of the cutoff procedure .",
    "however the rg procedure developed here depends only on the logarithmic behaviour of the correlator of @xmath41 at large distances , which is cut - off independent . as a result",
    ", a remarkable universality will emerge at the end of the procedure , which happens to be related to universality of front solutions in non - linear equations ( see below ) .",
    "we are now faced with the description of the scale - dependence of a coulomb gas with random fugacities , and thus _ a priori _ of the full corresponding fugacity distribution .",
    "since we find that , at low temperature , the distribution of the local core energy does not remain gaussian under coarse graining we can not restrict a priori the renormalization study to follow a small number of variables ( such as the mean and the variance ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : distribution ] .",
    "instead , we must study the scale dependence of the full distribution @xmath48 and especially the precise form of its tails around @xmath49 ( i.e @xmath50 ) which control the low temperature physics ( at @xmath51 defects appear where the local core energy is negative ) .",
    "this requires new techniques in two dimensions .    before developing a new rg procedure",
    ", we have to find a correct perturbative parameter to study the disorder driven transitions at low temperature . around the pure topological transition , this parameter corresponds to the charge fugacity @xmath2 ( for the most relevant charges @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , we expect that , upon lowering the temperature , a freezing of the defects occurs . in that case",
    ", most sites have a large core energy ( @xmath52 ) while only a few sites with @xmath49 are favorable to the defects .",
    "a natural choice for a perturbative parameter at low temperature in this highly non - homogeneous coulomb gas is thus the _ density of favorable sites _",
    "depends on the sign of the charge : @xmath53 , and the perturbative parameter is the density @xmath54 of sites favorable either to @xmath55 charges or to @xmath56 charges .",
    "one must thus follow the rg flow of the full probability distribution @xmath57 . ] which we note @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 plays an analogous role here than @xmath20 in the pure case : the quasi - ordered phase is caracterized by a density @xmath59 decreasing with the scale @xmath60 , while a disordered phase , where disorder induced topological defects proliferate , corresponds to an increasing @xmath59 .",
    "this new small parameter allows us to study in a controlled perturbative expansion the physics of the vortices at low temperature and around the transitions .",
    "an essential contribution to the renormalization of @xmath57 , absent in previous approaches , originates from what we call the _ fusion of random environments_. the main idea is the followoing .",
    "each random fugacities @xmath61 is associated with a region of size @xmath10 around @xmath0 . upon increasing the cut - off , the size of these regions increases , and we thus have to merge two regions distant from less than the new cutoff @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fusion - intro ] ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the fugacities in the new region can be deduced from the one in the two merged regions by a _",
    "fusion rule _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fusion - intro ] ) .",
    "the final renormalization of @xmath62 can be formulated into a single differential equation for the distribution function @xmath57 ( given in section [ part : replica ] ) .",
    "most interestingly we find that the universal features at the transition of the model ( @xmath63 ) do not depend on the precise definition of these regions .",
    "the fusion of environments corresponds to a non - linear term in the differential equation , which can thus be affected by a change of cut - off procedure .",
    "quite remarkably , the universality class at the new transition is determined by the properties of the front solutions of this differential equation ( i.e their velocity ) , that _ do not depend _ on the precise form of this non - linear term .",
    "hence universality in the usual rg sense finally appears from non trivial results of front propagation in non - linear equations .",
    "this differential rg equation for @xmath62 , together with the screening equations for @xmath8 and @xmath64 , can be obtained by a systematic and perturbatively controlled rg procedure .",
    "one formulation consists in using the replica trick to average the free energy over disorder , leading to a coulomb gas with @xmath37-component charges . in this formulation ,",
    "the infinite set of fugacities , associated with the vector charges @xmath65 $ ] , encode the distribution function @xmath62 of the random fugacities @xmath47 .",
    "hence , since this last distribution can not be _ a priori _ described by a finite number of moments at low temperature , we have to consider the scaling behaviour of the fugacities of all the replica charges with components @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 limit of this infinite set of rg equations is then taken by using an appropriate parametrization in terms of @xmath68 which yields the non linear rg equation for @xmath68 . the second , equivalent formulation ,",
    "does not rely on replica .",
    "it is constructed using a new expansion of physical quantities in the `` number of independent regions '' , introduced in this paper .",
    "after some transformations , we reduce the non - linear rg equation that governs the scale dependence of the distribution @xmath62 to the celebrated kolmogorov - petrovskii - piscounov ( kpp ) equation ( also named the fisher equation ) .",
    "the known results on this equation allow us to derive the form of the tails of the distribution and thus to obtain the phase diagram .",
    "in particular , the velocity of the front solutions of the kpp equation directly determines whether the small parameter @xmath69 increases or decreases . hence using known results on the selection of this velocity ,",
    "we obtain the phase diagram of the figure [ fig : phasediag - intro ] expressed in renormalized variables .",
    "the critical behaviour at the transition @xmath70 , follows from the finite size corrections to the velocity corrections of the kpp front and defines a new universality class .",
    "in particular , the correlation length @xmath71 diverges at the @xmath72 transition as @xmath73 in contrast with the kt behaviour found in @xcite .",
    "note that recent numerical simulations @xcite of this model seem to agree with the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag - intro ] and it would be interesting to also determine numerically the precise critical behaviour at low temperature .    besides the caracterization of the new critical behaviour our work also enables to study the freezing of vortices , which occurs below a temperature @xmath74",
    "( see figure [ fig : phasediag - intro ] ) .",
    "this freezing corresponds to a transition for the single charge problem , whose study with our new rg technique is presented in @xcite . in particular , this renormalization approach draws a precise connection between the physics of freezing of the xy defects and the problem of branched processes ( or of random directed polymers on cayley trees ( dpct ) for a discrete version ) studied by derrida and spohn @xcite .",
    "this connection naturally emerges from our coulomb gas rg equations via the kpp equation which has also appeared in the exact solution of the dpct problem @xcite .",
    "it does not rely on any ad - hoc construction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ part : model ] , the random xy model is defined and its cg formulation is carefully derived . in particular , the relation between the continuum limit and the decomposition of the random potential @xmath11 in to a local part ( random core energy ) and a long - range potential is discussed in section [ part : disdec ] .",
    "part [ part : replica ] describes the renormalization method of the replicated coulomb gas , and while a direct method ( without replica ) , which consists in expanding the free energy into the number of independent regions ( random environments ) is presented in section [ part : direct ] .",

    "a formulation in terms of a sine - gordon model is given in section [ part : sinegordon ] .",
    "the comparison with previous approaches is postponed to section [ part : other - approaches ] , and most of the technical details can be found in the appendices .",
    "in this section and in the following we study the xy model with random phases @xcite .",

    "this decomposition can be performed exactly ( see appendix [ part : cg ] ) for the corresponding villain model defined by the potential @xmath83 technically this is the model which we study here .",
    "it is reasonable however to expect that this villain model and the xy model should be in the same universality class ( as is the case without disorder ) .",
    "the rg analysis contained in the following sections is consistent with this assumption .",

    "one first needs to introduce a continuum version of this model . in the usual approach to 2d coulomb gas",

    "this is apparent , e.g. in the decomposition of the disorder that we have used .",

    "let us first explain the spirit of the direct method and illustrate how one is led to the rg equation ( [ rgeqp ] ) , derived more quantitatively in the next sections .",
    "we have seen in section [ part : disdec ] that the local disorder @xmath129 defines the site dependent fugacities .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath45 charges for which these fugacity variables read ( see ( [ locfug ] ) ) @xmath233 and are quenched random variables with only short range spatial correlations .",
    "one now studies the system under a change of cutoff @xmath234 ( coarse graining ) which includes an integration over the corresponding degrees of freedom .",

    "any two regions located around @xmath244 and @xmath245 with @xmath246 have to be considered as a single region in the system with the rescaled cutoff . as a consequence the two corresponding pairs of fugacities @xmath247 and @xmath248 must be combined and replaced by a single pair of effective fugacity variables @xmath249 associated with the new region at @xmath250 , as illustrated in fig .

    "this gives the fusion rule : @xmath254 the corresponding correction to the distribution @xmath68 produces the last two terms of ( [ rgeqp ] ) .",
    "finally , the rg equation for @xmath235 and @xmath237 can be obtained from the screening by small dipoles of the effective interaction and disorder between two infinitesimal test charges as described in section [ part : directrg2 ] .",
    "several comments are in order concerning this rg procedure .",
    "first we note that in defining local fugacity variables ( [ locz ] ) we have added an explicit spatial dependence to the part @xmath255 of the fugacity which does not distinguish between a @xmath55 and a @xmath56 charge .",
    "this dependence is not explicitly present in the bare model formula ( [ locfug ] ) ( although it is present if an additional small disorder in the local stiffness @xmath256 is included ) but , as we can see from ( [ fusion1 ] ) it appears as soon as fusion takes place ( the fusion rule is not compatible with a uniform @xmath257 ) .",
    "second , there are some assumptions underlying the rg procedure : technically we treat the local regions as independent from point to point , we restrict @xmath41 to be strictly gaussian , together with the usual assumptions ( e.g. short distance expansions ) of the cg renormalization .",
    "these assumptions are consistent and amount to discard less relevant operators .",
    "these irrelevant operators can be identified within the method using replica of section [ part : replica ] where the above assumptions appear as standard in the rg of the @xmath37-component vector cg .",
    "for instance , the separation of the disorder into the two components @xmath258 and @xmath129 corresponds in the replica method to the natural splitting in ( [ replicah ] ) between the vector fugacity local operator @xmath65 $ ] ( originating from @xmath129 ) and the off - diagonal replica coulomb interaction @xmath259 ( from @xmath258 )",
    ". this will be further apparent on the equivalent sine gordon representation of the problem presented in section [ part : sinegordon ] .",
    "accordingly , the definition of the independent local regions ( and thus of the local disorder environments and of the detailed form of the distribution @xmath260 ) is clearly cutoff dependent .",
    "so is the detailed form of the fusion rule ( [ fusion1 ] ) .",
    "however , universality of the physical results will be recovered in a remarkable way in section [ part : analysis ] , independently of the details of the cutoff procedure .",
    "as we will see , this is because , in the low temperature limit , the above definitions and fusion rules capture correctly ( to order @xmath261 ) the rare events which dominates the physics .",
    "they correctly evaluate the universal part of @xmath260 ( its tails in the low temperature region where they dominate the physics ) while they also correctly describe the weak disorder regime at higher temperatures .",
    "finally , we note that usual charge fusion between certain types of replica charges , represented on figure [ fusioncg2 ] corresponds , in the method without replica , to fusion of environments .      to renormalize consistently the present model we need a method which can handle in a systematic way broad distributions of local fugacities .",
    "we have found such a method , which we now introduce .",
    "it is based on a _ systematic expansion of physical quantities in the number of independent points_. it generalises the conventional fugacity expansion in @xmath2 of the pure case , but is more powerful . in effect",
    ", it amounts to a partial resummation of the conventional expansion .",
    "it is versatile since , as we will see , it yields back the conventional expansion in the pure case or at high temperature , but is also able to handle the broad distributions which arise at low temperature .",
    "the idea there is that only few rare regions ( favorable to the charges ) in each environment will dominate the observables and thus it becomes possible again to expand in the density of such rare regions .",
    "the idea underlying this expansion in the number of `` independent points '' is that the site - dependent fugacities associated with distinct `` points '' can be considered as statistically independent . on a lattice",
    ", these `` independent points '' naturally correspond to the sites of the lattice , while in the continuum model , their definition is necessarily cut - off dependent . upon coarse graining",
    ", we will be able to use this systematic expansion to renormalize consistently the fugacity distribution associated with each point .    for definiteness",
    ", we will show how to construct the expansion in number of points on the free energy @xmath262=-\\beta^{-1 } \\ln z[v]$ ] .",
    "it can be performed in a given environment , keeping the full functional dependence in the set of potentials @xmath263 .",

    "the definition ( [ free ] ) is unambiguous , though subtle .",
    "looking at the explicit expression ( [ fk ] ) as a sum over smaller subset of points one could imagine adding other terms to the @xmath272 depending on less than @xmath279 points .",
    "this is not possible in a global way , as the whole series must add up to the free energy , and the formula ( [ fk ] ) enforces it order by order .",
    "we refer to the appendix [ part : appexp ] for further details about the precise definition and construction .",
    "note that the term @xmath280 vanishes here because due to neutrality one can not define a cg on a single site and that the expansion in the number of points of powers @xmath281 $ ] involves a rearrangment of the expansion of @xmath262 $ ] .",
    "it is important to stress that each term @xmath282 of the above expansion corresponds to an infinite sum over terms of _ arbitrary high order in the conventional fugacity @xmath2 _ ( as defined in ( [ locfug ] ) ) .",
    "this can also be seen when setting disorder to zero , where we find that each @xmath283 ( @xmath284 ) and @xmath285 ( @xmath286 ) starts as @xmath287 plus an infinite number of additional higher order terms in @xmath2 ( see below ) .",
    "indeed the expansion ( [ free ] ) corresponds to a complete resummation of the conventional fugacity expansion usually performed in coulomb gas studies @xcite except that it is usually performed on the partition function @xmath288 while here we perform it on the free energy .",
    "the expansion ( [ free ] ) using the free energy is the appropriate expansion when the fugacities ( or the core energies ) are random and strongly site dependent with a broad distribution ( e.g. most of the sites have @xmath289 except for a few which have @xmath290 ) .",
    "indeed , in this case the only small parameter is the probability @xmath291 that a given point is favorable for a charge .",

    "it is interesting to note that the term @xmath310 is present ( and important ) in the expansion of @xmath316 , even though there are no actual configuration with three charges in a given environment ( from neutrality ) .",

    "it was thus missed in previous studies , while in fact we show in the next section that it gives rise to a crucial contribution to the renormalization of the distribution of disordered fugacities : the _ fusion of environments_.    the above defined expansion in number of independent points ( a type of cluster - virial expansion ) which we have illustrated on the first few terms , can be performed systematically to all orders . by coarse graining all terms of the expansion self - consistently , we will now obtain the renormalisation of the disorder distribution .",
    "we now propose a renormalisation scheme based on the above expansion ( [ free ] ) . from ( [ part : physics ] ) one captures the relevant physics by defining random local charge fugacities @xmath317 at each point and splitting the disorder distribution as @xmath318=\\prod_{\\bf r } p(z^{+}_{\\bf r } , z^{-}_{\\bf r } ) p[v^>_{\\bf r}]$ ] as in ( [ decomposition ] ) .",

    "this dependence will appear in each term @xmath282 of the expansion ( [ free ] ) .",
    "upon changing the cutoff this will results in contributions of order @xmath323 which can be absorbed by appropriate redefinitions as follows .",
    "the interaction term changes as : @xmath324 where we have used the neutrality condition @xmath325 .",

    "for instance , from the above and ( [ typ2 ] ) one finds the following decay of the _ typical _ thermal and disorder correlations :    @xmath682    for @xmath683 and @xmath606 . for @xmath674 one",

    "although we have not attempted a precise rg calculation of the xy order correlation functions , the following behaviour should hold in the quasi ordered xy phase :    @xmath690    with @xmath691 and @xmath692 . at the zero temperature transition point @xmath693 , @xmath51 , the value of these exponents are universal @xmath694 .",
    "we now study the transition from the xy to the disordered phases at low temperature at @xmath695 . from the previous sections we know",

    "near the transition the center of the front is located at @xmath700 with @xmath701 as indicated by ( [ velocity - corrections ] ) .",

    "we can use the kpp front solution @xmath705 with , from ( [ front - intermediate ] ) : @xmath706 an expression valid as long as @xmath707 .",
    "the rg equations for @xmath8 and @xmath26 in the critical region thus read :    [ sct0 ] @xmath708    we need to evaluate these expressions for @xmath709 large and negative ( typically either as @xmath710 on the critical manifold or as @xmath711 very close to it ) . at criticality",

    "a natural choice of parameters to describe the universal behaviour around the transition is thus @xmath721 ( which up to logarithmic corrections is equal to the density of favorable sites @xmath722 ) and @xmath26 which satisfies : @xmath723 these two equations ( [ eq - g ] , [ eq - sigma - g ] ) form our complete set of rg equations projected on the plane @xmath724 .",

    "let us close by noting again how universality appears in the derivation of the critical behaviour .",
    "although most details of the fugacity distribution @xmath745 ( e.g. its bulk , the fusion rule .. ) depend on the cutoff procedure the universality in the xy transition appears in a remarkable way .",
    "it arises from the independence @xcite of the velocity , the velocity corrections , and front tail on the precise form @xmath746 $ ] of the non linear term in ( [ kpp - general ] ) .",
    "this gives us confidence in the method developped here .",
    "as is well known the coulomb gas can also be equivalently formulated as a sine gordon model ( see _ e.g _ @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we identify the random version of the sine gordon model to which our analysis applies .",
    "the scalar sine gordon model , of partition function @xmath747 is defined , in the absence of disorder by the action : @xmath748 where @xmath749 $ ] .",
    "as is well known it is equivalent to a coulomb gas since , expanding in @xmath721 one has : @xmath750 where @xmath751 denotes averages with respect only to the quadratic gradient part . the interaction @xmath752 has been defined in ( [ part : model ] ) .",
    "the above partition sums involve only @xmath753 neutral pairs of dipoles since , in the large size limit @xmath754 .",
    "finally @xmath755 in the last line involves a summation over all distinct charges with @xmath756 for @xmath757 and @xmath758 for @xmath759 .",
    "let us turn to the disordered version of the model . to reproduce the bare version ( [ zcont ] ) of the model",
    ", one must first add a short range correlated random _",
    "imaginary _ field as follows : @xmath760 with correlations @xmath761 .",
    "since it imposes now that @xmath762 , each factor @xmath763 in the @xmath721 expansion in ( [ sgexp ] ) yields an additional @xmath764 where @xmath765 and thus reproduces the bare cg version ( [ zcont ] ) of our model .",
    "note that the above model still contains a uniform `` fugacity '' @xmath721 .",
    "it thus corresponds to the version studied in @xcite by rubinstein et al .",
    "however we know that this can not be the correct form under renormalization .",
    "the first obvious idea is to generalize @xmath766 , i.e a disordered fugacity ( the above expansion can be immediately generalized to this case )",
    ". this term will be generated , but is not the end of the story .",
    "indeed let us consider the symmetries of the above action @xmath767 ( even in the presence of a @xmath768 ) .",
    "when @xmath769 the action is real and invariant through @xmath770 . in the presence of the random field",
    "this symmetry is broken ( as @xmath771 acquires a non zero , disorder environment dependent average ) and the action is complex .",
    "thus nothing prevents that under coarse graining the action will become : @xmath772 and this is indeed precisely what we have found in the cg formulation , i.e each sign of charge acquires a _",
    "different _ local random fugacity .",
    "there is however a symmetry constraint on the distribution of the local random fugacities . indeed in the above bare model ( [ sgaction ] ) the full partition sum is real , as there is still a _ statistical symmetry _ : @xmath773 for any configuration @xmath771 and environment @xmath774 . since the probabilities of @xmath774 and @xmath775 are the same , all physical averages will be real .",
    "in the coarse grained model ( [ sgcoarse ] ) , since we have that @xmath776 the probability ( over environments ) of the random fugacity disorder configuration @xmath777 should be equal to the probability of @xmath778 .",
    "we can now check that this random sine gordon model ( [ sgcoarse ] ) is indeed equivalent to the coarse grained disordered cg considered in this paper by expanding its the partition sum in a given environment , which yields : @xmath779 and thus the @xmath95 random field disorder is associated to the long range part @xmath321 of the disorder in the cg ( see ( [ decomposition ] ) ) while the random couplings constants @xmath780 in ( [ sgcoarse ] ) are associated to the local random fugacities in the cg .",
    "similarly one can establish a correspondence directly on the replicated versions of both models . replicating the above sg model and averaging over disorder yields ( the limit @xmath139 is implicit ) :    @xmath781    expanded to first order and treating the @xmath782 and @xmath783 as uncorrelated in space and reexponentiating yields the replicated sg model defined as :    @xmath784   e^{i { \\bf n } \\cdot { \\bf \\phi } }   \\label{replicatedsg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath785 is the scalar product in replica space and @xmath65 $ ] are analogous to the vector fugacities introduced previously in the replicated vector cg model .",
    "although the bare model obtained from ( [ averagesg ] ) contains only single component replicated charges , all multicomponent charges will be generated upon coarse graining , as in the replicated vector cg . as we have seen all these charges should be taken into account and thus the generic replicated sg model should contain all possible @xmath65 $ ] with @xmath786 .",
    "this sg model can also be studied using rg , either in its replicated form ( [ replicatedsg ] ) , or directly ( [ sgcoarse ] ) , very similarly to the vector cg studied in this paper .",
    "although variations in definitions of the fugacities @xmath65 $ ] and different cutoff procedures can induce some irrelevant differences in the details of the renormalization ( and different rg equations ) , the two models have the same physics .",
    "the sine gordon formulation has several advantages , such as exhibiting by construction the decomposition of the disorder in two physically very different components ( see [ decomposition ] ) .",
    "it is also more amenable to replica variational methods than the cg , left for future study .",
    "let us compare our method and results with the work of scheidl @xcite",
    ". in this work the multicomponent charges ( restricted to @xmath66 in each replica ) were considered , but the fusion was not taken into account . also only dipole fugacities were introduced .",
    "we can recover the rg equations and results of scheidl within our approach by ( i ) artificially setting the fusion coefficient @xmath197 to @xmath115 in ( [ loose ] ) ( ii ) assuming a log - normal distribution @xmath787 for the fugacities ( which is consistent only when fusion is neglected ) ( iii ) defining random `` dipole fugacities '' as @xmath788 and @xmath789 ( or equivalently @xmath790 ) identical to the `` dummy gaussian variables '' introduced by scheidl . within our diffusion formalism ( see section([part : replicalimit ] ) ) we find that the norm @xmath791 diverges exponentially , which allows to recovers the extra factors @xmath792 appearing in scheidl s screening equations . going from our diffusion formalism back to the replica formulation yields back the rg equations of @xcite    .    in presence of a fusion term @xmath793 ,",
    "the equations become a priori very different",
    ". the fugacity distribution does not remain log - normal as we do not assume a priori the form of the distribution .",
    "interestingly , although the log - normal does not reproduce correctly the true distribution of fugacities ( and misses connections such as the one with the freezing of the dpct via the kpp equation ) , some of our results deep in the xy phase , such as the renormalization of @xmath794 and @xmath26 ( see ( [ screeningc ] ) ) , agree with the one of scheidl .",
    "it was not obvious a priori that the approach without fusion in the xy phase did not miss extra relevant physics in this model , and indeed near the transition fusion appears to be crucial and must be taken into account .",
    "to conclude , we have constructed in this paper a novel renormalization group method which allows to study perturbatively , and in a consistent way , a large class of disordered models which can be formulated as two dimensional coulomb gases with quenched disorder .",
    "we have applied it specifically to the xy model with quenched random phases .",
    "we have obtained the phase diagram for this model , confirmed the existence of a low temperature xy phase , and elucidated the critical behaviour at the transition where topological defects proliferate .",
    "it would be interesting to check our predictions in numerical simulations    the present rg method is not based on the conventional perturbative expansion in a vortex fugacity @xmath2 spatially uniform over the system , which , as we have shown , is only justified for pure models or for disordered models at high enough temperature .",
    "instead , it is constructed by first defining the local random vortex fugacity ( or core energy ) and then following its full probability distribution under coarse graining . below a freezing temperature",
    "this distribution becomes very broad and can not be followed by conventional cg methods .",
    "our renormalization procedure allows to follow this broad distribution in a controlled way , by defining the new perturbative parameter as the concentration @xmath406 of rare regions favorable to vortices .",
    "this running parameter flows to zero in the xy phase and at the transition ( marginal flow ) .",
    "hence both can be studied perturbatively .",
    "the underlying physical picture obtained here is that the transition is controlled , as the scale increases , by the proliferation of vortices in less and less rare favorable regions .",
    "we find that it has some features reminiscent of a kosterlitz - thouless transition , with important differences , such as the scaling of the correlation length .    to derive the rg equation for the distribution of vortex fugacities , we have introduced two equivalent methods .",
    "one is based on the replicated vector coulomb gas version of the model , and in an expansion in the vector fugacities .",
    "the second one is direct , with no use of replicas , and is based on a systematic expansion of all physical quantities in the number of points , i.e in independent local regions and thus , in the end , in powers of the concentration @xmath406 of rare favorable regions . as we have shown these two methods",
    "are fully equivalent : the first one being more systematic and the second one allowing for a clear physical understanding of the problem in terms of probability distributions .",
    "these two expansion methods are highly non perturbative in the original uniform fugacity variable @xmath2 .",
    "since they are constructed from charge fugacities they can be made fully consistent ( by contrast with previous approaches based on dipole fugacities ) .",
    "our method sheds light on the broader issue of universality in random systems .",
    "the spirit of the rg method is that at large scale most information about the system is irrelevant and can be discarded . in constructing our rg procedure",
    "we have first shown , using the very special properties of logarithmic interactions , that it is enough to follow , in addition to the two parameters @xmath794 and @xmath26 , the distribution of only one or two local ( i.e uncorrelated ) random variables @xmath795 . at this stage",
    "it is clear that we still keep too much information .",
    "indeed we have found that the precise form the non linear rg equation obeyed by @xmath795 as well as the detailed shape of this distribution are largely cutoff dependent .",
    "however , this complicated looking rg equation can be generally recast , up to irrelevant terms , as a well known non linear front propagation of the kpp type . using the known remarkable universality property of this type of non linear equations",
    ", we found that all the information needed to describe the universal properties of the xy phase and of the transition is indeed independent of the detailed shape of the fugacity distribution , or of the precise form of its rg equation .",
    "only its tails , and the finite size corrections to the front velocity seem to be needed to determine the physical quantities and the critical behaviour .",
    "since we are following a full distribution of local disorder , the present method could be termed a functional rg .",
    "we can indeed draw some parallel between this functional rg procedure for the disordered cg and two other known examples where the universal behaviour of a disordered finite - range system is extracted from a functional rg equation .",
    "the first one is the asymptotically exact real space rg in @xmath796 @xcite well suited to `` infinite disorder '' fixed points .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite there are indeed similarities when treating the single vortex , @xmath796 version of the present model .",
    "the method of @xcite can be applied for the sinai potential which has correlations growing as a power of distance . for the present case of weaker , logarithmic correlations",
    ", these methods can also be applied in principle ( at least around zero temperature where disorder is still very broad ) but become very hard to work out analytically .",
    "the other example of functional rg appears in a dimensional expansion for the problem of an interface in a random potential @xcite , which has infinite number of marginal directions at the upper critical dimension @xmath797 .",
    "an important question is whether in the problem studied in this paper there is also an infinite number of marginal directions . as discussed above",
    ", the results extracted from the kpp equation seem to suggest that a smaller amount of information than the exact full distribution may be needed here .",
    "thus one can speculate that the critical theory studied here could be equivalently formulated as a more conventional field theory , yet to be identified , with a small number of marginal or relevant operators . in any case",
    "the rg method developed here should provide a physically transparent guide to study the system . given the wide applications of coulomb gases in two dimensions",
    "it is likely that other two dimensional disordered models can be studied using methods similar to the one introduced here .",
    "finally , another outcome of the present work has been to unveil some interesting connections between the renormalization of a disordered system and the universal features of the propagation of invading fronts in non linear systems .",
    "the existence of intriguing relations between freezing transitions and velocity selection in non linear fronts was noticed previously by derrida and spohn @xcite in their study of the dpct . here",
    ", we found an even deeper and puzzling connection , betwen the `` universality '' in these selection mecanisms and the universality in the critical phenomena captured by the renormalization group .",
    "since attempts have been made to construct renormalization methods in order to extract the universal features of such non linear equations @xcite , this suggests that a common framework could be developed in connexion with two dimensional disordered models .    * acknowledgements *    it is a pleasure to thank b. derrida , v. hakim and w. van saarloos for useful discussions .",

    "let us consider for instance the charges @xmath1015 and define @xmath1016 and @xmath1017 respectively as the number of component charges @xmath1018 and @xmath1019 in the vector charge @xmath38 .",
    "the parametrization ( [ eq : ydef ] ) can be readily extended to encode also for the charges @xmath1015 simply by writing the vector fugacity @xmath65 $ ] as an average over a function @xmath1020 as @xmath1021 = \\int_{z_{+},z_{-},z_{++},z_{-- } } \\phi(z_{+},z_{-},z_{++},z_{-- } ) z_{+}^{n_{+ } } z_{-}^{n_{- } }   z_{++}^{n_{++ } } z_{--}^{n_{-- } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the random variables @xmath1022 and @xmath1023 represent the random local fugacities for the charges @xmath1015 .",
    "similar manipulations as in appendix ( [ part : replimit ] ) lead to a rg equation for a normalized @xmath1024 which we will not write explicitly .",
    "it does contain a diffusion operator as well as a fusion term . for illustration we simply give the diffusion operator , expressed using more convenient variables @xmath1025 and @xmath1026 and @xmath1027 .",
    "it reads , for the corresponding probability distribution @xmath1028 : @xmath1029 the detailed study of the corresponding rg equation , together with the fusion term will not be reported here .",
    "instead let us indicate how the irrelevance of the higher charges can be justified .",
    "since one has : @xmath1030 it is clear that the reduced probability @xmath1031 satisfies the same diffusion equation as @xmath193 in ( [ rgeqp ] ) but with the change @xmath1032 and @xmath1033 .",
    "it becomes relevant by power counting only at @xmath1034 .",
    "thus it is less relevant than @xmath193 in the region of the phase diagram of interest and we can rightly neglect the new fugacities @xmath1022 and @xmath1023 .",
    "one can also check that the fusion terms imply that @xmath1035 is of order @xmath1036 when this parameter is small ( since at lowest order the rg equation contains a term proportional to @xmath1037 ) .",
    "the rare events which involve the charges @xmath1015 are thus subdominant .",
    "to evaluate the integral ( [ sct0.1 ] ) in the screening equation for @xmath8 we consider separately three intervals @xmath1038 , @xmath1039 and @xmath1040 , where @xmath1041 is a number such that @xmath1042 can be replaced by its asymptotic expression for @xmath1043 with good accuracy . only in the middle interval",
    "can we use the universal tail expressions for both factors @xmath1044 .",
    "thus we have , using symetries :          since , remembering that the integral @xmath1047 , the above integral is at most a finite number . the second integral in ( [ cutintwo ] ) is estimated as : @xmath1048 and gives the leading contribution .",
    "for @xmath657 it behaves as @xmath1049 and gives the estimate in the text .",
    "it is encouraging to note that the leading behaviour precisely originates from the interval where @xmath1050 can be replaced everywhere by its universal asymptotic form .",
    "the integral ( [ sct0.2 ] ) in the screening equation for @xmath26 can also be estimated by considering for each variable @xmath180 , @xmath1051 two intervals @xmath1052 and @xmath1053 .",
    "the end result is that we find to leading order :"
