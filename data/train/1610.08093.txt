    "observations data from type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite obviously signal us an accelerating universe at the present time . from theoretical point of view , this expanding phase of the universe is supported by an unknown source called dark energy ( de ) @xcite .",
    "the simplest model , which consists of a fluid with positive energy density and negative pressure , is called cosmological constant and suffers from some problems such as the fine - tuning and the coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "although , many different models , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom ( ghost ) field @xcite , k - essence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , agegraphic de @xcite and ghost de models @xcite have been proposed to justify the current accelerating phase of the universe expansion , de is still a confusing topic in modern cosmology @xcite and its nature and origin is an unknown problem .    following the developments in quantum theory of gravity",
    ", the motivation to solve the de problem , including its nature and behavior , has arisen a lot of attentions @xcite .",
    "an example of such effort is the hde models @xcite .",
    "the area - entropy relation is the backbone of this hypothesis claiming that black hole relates the short distance cutoff to the long distance cutoff , which leads to an upper bound for the zero - point energy density @xcite .",
    "based on this theory , we have @xmath0 for the energy density of hde , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , a constant and the infrared ( ir ) cutoff , and @xmath3 is the reduced planck mass @xcite .",
    "one of the basic assumption in the hde models is the suitable ir cutoff which leads to an accelerated universe .",
    "the simplest choice for the ir cutoff is the hubble radius which is defined as , @xmath4 .",
    "however , it was argued that hubble radius can not lead to an accelerating universe @xcite , unless the interaction between de and dm is taken into account @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "granda and oliveros ( go ) proposed a combination of the hubble parameter and its first derivative as the ir cutoff of hde models , namely @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constant @xcite .",
    "this cutoff which is known as the go cutoff avoids the causality problem and solves the coincidence problem and extensively investigated in the literatures @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations indicate that the possibility of a mutual interaction between the dm and de , which may solve the coincidence problem , is not zero @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of this mutual interaction can be written as @xmath8 in which @xmath9 is a constant and @xmath10 can be the energy density of dm , de or even their sum @xcite .",
    "since @xmath9 is constant and @xmath11 and @xmath10 are positive quantities , the sign of the interaction term is not changed during the cosmic evolution .",
    "however , recent investigations confirm that the sign of the interaction between dm and de is changed during the history of the universe and in particular in the redshift @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the sign - changeable interaction term can not be described by the @xmath8 expression .",
    "following @xcite , wei proposed the sign - changeable interaction term as @xmath13 for the mutual interaction @xcite . in this new expression ,",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dimensionless constant and @xmath14 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "the key ingredient is the deceleration parameter @xmath15 in the interaction @xmath16 , and hence the interaction @xmath16 can change its sign when our universe changes from deceleration phase @xmath17 to acceleration @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 terms are introduced from the dimensional point of view @xcite , and one can ignore the @xmath19 term by considering @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath22 form has previously been introduced to describe the mutual interaction between the dark sectors of cosmos @xcite .",
    "now , bearing the firedmann equation in mind ( @xmath23 ) , we find out that the @xmath22 interaction can indeed be written in the @xmath24 form . on the other hand , since @xmath25 , the @xmath26 interaction can also be written in the form @xmath24 , meaning that in the wei s approach , the appearance of the deceleration parameter , @xmath15 , in the interaction term @xmath16 is quite acceptable @xcite .    in the present work , we are interested in studying the cosmological consequences of considering a sign - changeable interaction term in hde model .",
    "we shall take @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total energy density .",
    "we will consider three cutoffs , including the future event horizon , the hubble and go cutoffs , to build the energy density of hde which helps us in providing three models for de .",
    "thereinafter , we investigate the evolution of the system parameters , such as the state parameter as well as the deceleration and dimensionless density parameters , during the cosmos evolution from the matter dominated era to the current accelerating epoch .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath29",
    ", we use the future event horizon as the ir cutoff to build the hde , and study the evolution of the system s cosmological parameters .",
    "sections @xmath30 and @xmath31 also include the hde models with the hubble and go cutoffs , respectively . to have a better understanding of the system evolution , we plot the cosmological parameters , such as @xmath15 , the equation of state and dimensionless density parameters , in terms of the redshift @xmath32 .",
    "we finish with summary and concluding remarks in the last section .",
    "we consider a homogeneous and isotropic flat frw universe which is described by the line element @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is scale factor . the first friedmann equation is written as @xmath35 where @xmath10 is the total energy density , which satisfy the conservation law @xmath36 we assume the two dark sectors of the universe , namely pressureless dm and hde exchange energy and thus they no longer satisfy the conservation equations , separately .",
    "instead , they satisfy the semi - conservation equations as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the equation of state parameter of hde , and @xmath16 denotes the interaction term between de and dm .",
    "as it is obvious , de ( dm ) decays into dm ( de ) for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we assume the interaction term has the following form @xmath41 where @xmath9 is the coupling constant and @xmath15 is the deceleration parameter defined as @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , it is obvious that the transition of the universe from the deceleration @xmath43 to an acceleration @xmath44 phase , changes the sign of the interaction term @xmath16 . defining , as usual , the dimensionless density parameters as @xmath45 we can rewrite the first friedmann equation in the form @xmath46 also , if we take the time derivative of the ratio of the energy densities , @xmath47 we find @xmath48 where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ conm ] ) and  ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "solving for @xmath49 , we arrive at @xmath50     versus redshift parameter @xmath32 for hde with future cutoff for a fixed interaction parameter with coupling interaction @xmath9 but for different values of the constant @xmath51.,width=302 ]    using eqs .",

    "<S> we use three ir cutoffs , including the future event horizon , the hubble and granda - oliveros ( go ) cutoffs , to construct three holographic models of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we consider a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe filled by a dark matter ( dm ) and a dark energy that interact with each other through a mutual sign - changeable interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thereinafter , we address the evolution of the some cosmological parameters , such as the equation of state and dimensionless density parameters of dark energy as well as the deceleration parameter , during the cosmic evolution from the matter dominated era until the late time acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that a holographic dark energy ( hde ) model with hubble cutoff interacting with dm may be in line with the current universe . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that models with the future event horizon as the ir cutoff or the go cutoff are in good agreement with the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find out that these obtained models can predict the universe transition from a deceleration phase to the acceleration one in a compatible way with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the three obtained models may also allow the equation of state parameter to cross the phantom line , a result which depends on the values of the system s constants such as the value of the interaction coupling constant . </S>"
