    "the galaxy m81 ( ngc 3031 ) is one of the largest grand design spiral galaxies in the sky ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is a member of the m81 galaxy group whose principle members are m81 , m82 , ngc 3077 , and ngc 2976 and include a number of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "prominent tidal hi tails around m81 show that it is interacting with m82 and ngc3077 @xcite .",
    "the cepheid distance to m81 is 3.6  mpc @xcite .",
    "the proximity of m81 has made it a favorite target for many investigations of galaxy properties from the x - ray to radio ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many , well - resolved images of m81 from ultraviolet ( uv ) to radio wavelengths have been taken , with the notable exception of the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "previously , well resolved far - ir images of galaxies have only been possible for local group galaxies such as the magellanic clouds @xcite , m31 @xcite , and m33 @xcite . with the successful launch of the _ spitzer space telescope",
    "@xcite , it is now possible to map many large galaxies in the far - ir with good spatial resolution , good sensitivity , and in a reasonable amount of time . infrared array camera ( irac , * ?",

    "the mips images are presented in this paper and @xcite presents the irac images .",
    "m81 is one of the key galaxies in the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings , * ? ? ?",
    "we have chosen to investigate the variation of star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators and the infrared - radio correlation across the disk of m81 to highlight two of the questions which can be probed with these new observations .",
    "we compare the mips observations with existing uv and h@xmath1 images to probe the behaviors of the ir , h@xmath1 , and uv sfr indicators across m81 .",
    "such comparisons of sfr indicators have been made for global galaxy fluxes ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but rarely has it been possible to resolve all three sfr indicators in a single galaxy . by studying the resolved behavior of these sfr indicators , a better understanding of their sensitivities to dust and stellar age can be determined .",
    "this will improve the accuracy of these sfr indicators for both resolved and global galaxy measurements .",
    "radio emission is another possible sfr indicator , but it is not as mature as the others @xcite . as such ,",
    "we have chosen to explore the more established infrared - radio correlation @xcite .",
    "images of m81 at 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 were obtained in a manner similar to that described in @xcite for ngc  55 .",
    "the mips images were reduced using the mips instrument team data analysis tool @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on the final absolute calibrations are estimated at 10% , 20% , and 20% for the 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 data , respectively .",
    "the final mips mosaics are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_mips_fullres ] .",
    "the 70 and 160  @xmath0 images exhibit linear streaks along the scan direction ( roughly north - south ) which are residual instrumental artifacts due to the time dependent responsivity of the ge detectors .",
    "ultraviolet images of m81 were taken with the ultraviolet imaging telescope in far - uv and near - uv bands @xcite .",
    "the deepest , geometrically corrected , flux calibrated images for each band were retrieved from the multimission archive at space telescope .",
    "the h@xmath1 image of m81 was taken from @xcite .",
    "the radio image at 20  cm was created from archival very large array ( vla ) c  array data , using standard aips reduction techniques .",
    "each image of m81 was cropped to a common field - of - view ( @xmath3 ) and convolved to match the point - spread - function ( psf ) of the mips 160  @xmath0 image to allow for a consistent comparison of the images .",
    "we used a fourier transform technique for the convolution as described in @xcite .",
    "all of the convolved images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_all_images ] .",
    "the 160  @xmath0 psf clearly has an airy ring resulting in a prominent ring surrounding point sources in some of the images .",
    "at 160  @xmath0 resolution , the grand design nature of m81 is very prominent in all but the r band image .",
    "the r band image displays a morphology dominated by the bulge , with only faint spiral arms present . at the other wavelengths , the spiral arms show a continuum of morphologies from being a string of point sources ( h@xmath1 and 24  @xmath0 ) to exhibiting both point sources and an underlying smoother distribution ( uv and 70  @xmath0 ) to fairly smooth arms with faint point sources ( 160  @xmath0 and radio ) .",
    "this difference in the appearance is related to the age of stars probed and the importance of dust attenuation .",
    "for example , h@xmath1 probes younger star formation than the uv images and , as a result , the uv images are smoother than the h@xmath1 image .",
    "evidence that dust attenuation is affecting the arm morphology is seen in the southeast of m81 where a prominent piece of the galaxy is missing from the uv and h@xmath1 images ( see ellipse in fig .  [ fig_all_images ] ) , but not from the ir or radio images .",
    "we investigated the behavior of the popular uv , h@xmath1 , and ir sfrs in m81 .",
    "h@xmath1 and uv sfr indicators suffer from dust attenuation and probe stellar ages of 10 and 100  myr , respectively .",
    "the ir sfr indicator does not have an age bias , but does assume that all of the starlight from the star formation is absorbed by dust and re - emitted in the ir .",
    "as we use resolved images of m81 for all three sfr indicators , we can probe the biases affecting each method in detail .",
    "we have extracted fluxes for specific regions in m81 from the 160  @xmath0 resolution images , correcting the uv and h@xmath1 fluxes for a foreground milky way extinction with an @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the regions are shown in fig .  [ fig_ext_reg ] .    in order to convert measured uv , h@xmath1 , and ir luminosities to sfrs , calibrations are needed .",
    "one way to determine such calibrations is to use stellar evolutionary synthesis models ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite has provided such calibrations with stellar age assumptions appropriate for entire galaxies .",
    "while the @xcite calibrations will be invalid at some level for regions of galaxies , we have chosen to use them as they allow a physical basis for interpretation of luminosities .",
    "the total ir flux was calculated using the tir equation of @xcite formulated specifically to determine the 31100  @xmath0 luminosity given mips measurements .",
    "all of the sfrs in this paper are uncorrected for dust attenuation as proper treatment of dust attenuation is beyond the scope of this paper ( eg .",
    "the sfrs for the whole galaxy are estimated to be 0.31 , 0.38 , and 0.89 @xmath5 from the integrated uv , h@xmath1 , and ir luminosities , respectively .",
    "the luminosities and sfrs determined in the regions defined in fig .",
    "[ fig_ext_reg ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_sfr_reg ] .",
    "the arm regions display the largest area - normalized ir sfrs which is evidence that they have the highest sfrs .",
    "the ratio of h@xmath1/ir luminosities is higher for the arm regions than any of the other regions .",
    "for all the regions , the uv and h@xmath1 sfrs are always smaller than the ir sfrs and there is a weak trend towards smaller uv / tir and h@xmath1/tir sfr ratios as the tir sfr increases .",
    "there are three possible causes of these effects : 1 ) dust is attenuating the uv and @xmath6 measurements .",
    "2 ) a fraction of the ir flux may not be associated with recent star formation ( i.e. , dust heated by old stars ) .",
    "3 ) the luminosity - sfr calibrations of @xcite are not appropriate for individual regions in a galaxy , where there may be transfer of energy between different regions ( radiative transfer effects ) and/or stellar age differences from those assumed by @xcite which will affect sfr indicators at different levels .",
    "we will investigate the relative importance of these factors in future papers but briefly discuss the first two points below .",
    "the association of significant ir emission with bright uv and h@xmath1 regions is evidence for significant dust attenuation .",
    "the dust attenuation is probed in fig .",
    "[ fig_dust_atten ] where the ir / uv ratio and uv color attenuation measures are plotted .",
    "the ir / uv ratio has been shown to be a good dust attenuation measure for galaxies and the uv attenuations for the extracted regions vary between 0.5 and 3.0 mag for log(@xmath7 ) between 0.5 and 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 ratio is also a dust attenuation measure , but as it is a uv color , it is significantly more uncertain @xcite .",
    "this flux ratio is very similar to the more familiar @xmath9 dust attenuation measure @xcite .",
    "the starburst calibration of these measures is shown in fig .  [ fig_dust_atten ] and does not describe the measurements of m81 .",
    "deviations from the starburst calibration were also found by @xcite for large magellanic cloud hii regions and by @xcite for global measurements of galaxies more quiescent than starbursts .",
    "this implies that the dust geometry and/or dust grain properties are different between starburst galaxies and star forming regions in normal galaxies .    in studies of ir sfrs , it is common to assume that the cold dust is mainly heated by old stars , and thus the cold dust emission ( 160  @xmath0 ) should not be used in determining ir sfrs .",
    "the m81 images presented in this paper allow us to probe this assumption for the m81 disk but not the agn dominated nucleus .",
    "the morphology of the spiral arms progresses from point - like to fairly smooth from 24 to 160  @xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath1 and uv bright regions are seen at 160  @xmath0 implying that young stars heat a fraction of the 160  @xmath0 emission .",
    "the morphology of the ir images best matches the h@xmath1 and uv images as opposed to the r band image ( an old star tracer in m81 ) , but this correlation is not enough to identify the dominant 160  @xmath0 heating source , as the spiral density wave concentrates the dust in the arms .",
    "the smoother morphology of the uv images compared to the h@xmath1 image shows that the non - ionizing uv bright stars have migrated out of their natal regions .",
    "young , hot stars are more efficient than the old stars at heating dust since their emission peaks at uv / blue wavelengths where dust is most efficient at absorbing photons .",
    "given that both the cold dust and the stars most efficient at heating dust are concentrated in the spiral arms , it is likely that those stars are the dominant heating source for the 160  @xmath0 dust in the spiral arms .",
    "the far - ir dust emission and the radio continuum emission both trace active star formation in galaxies , and are known to be tightly correlated on galactic scales @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_radio_ir ] , we show the far - ir ( 42 - 122@xmath10 m , fir ) to radio ratio map of m81 constructed using the 160  @xmath0 resolution mips images and 20  cm continuum data ( @xmath11 ) . the mips bands were combined to create a tir image and the fractional fir @xcite component was estimated per pixel using the @xcite models .",
    "the value of @xmath12 ranges from @xmath131.80 for the agn dominated nuclear region to @xmath132.87 for the bright star forming regions , with an intermediate value of @xmath132.07 for the interarm regions .",
    "a similar range in @xmath12 was seen for m33 by @xcite , although they did not comment on any large scale structure seen in @xmath12 variations as we see in m81 . for comparison ,",
    "the average @xmath12 value found for galaxies by @xcite is 2.34 .",
    "the variation in @xmath12 is coherent with structures related to the m81 spiral arms , confirming that the radio - infrared correlation is more complex inside individual galaxies than between galaxies .",
    "this variation will be investigated in detail in future papers to explore the dynamics of cosmic - ray electron propagation and escape @xcite .",
    "we presented mips images of m81 at 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0 which reveal a bright nucleus and two well resolved spiral arms studded with bright regions of star formation .",
    "these images show that m81 has a significant amount of cold dust associated with the spiral arms . from multiwavelength morphology comparisons ,",
    "the dust heating is argued be dominated by recent star formation even at the longest mips wavelength .",
    "the resolved uv and h@xmath1 sfrs are always lower than the ir sfrs indicating significant dust attenuation , radiative transfer effects , and/or different stellar ages than assumed for the @xcite sfr calibrations .",
    "the character of the dust attenuation indicates that the dust geometry and/or grain properties are different for resolved regions in m81 than in starburst galaxies .",
    "the infrared - radio correlation was found to vary by a factor of @xmath136 in the m81 with coherent structures relating to the spiral arms .",
    "these results illustrates the need for additional theoretical and empirical work on how to accurately combine different sfr indicators , accounting for dust , age , and radiative transfer effects , to give an accurate view of the star formation in regions of galaxies .",
    "the sings team is warmly thanked for allowing m81 to be part of the ero program .",
    "we thank rene waterbos for providing us with the h@xmath1 and r band images .",
