    "the understanding of inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions is an important challenge for the theory of the strong interactions , since these processes are expected to be dominated by small transverse momentum exchange . in general , nonperturbative approaches and/or phenomenological models based on soft physics ( e.g. reggeon approach )",
    "are used to study hadron production with a satisfactory description of the experimental data . however , a shortcoming of these approaches is that they are not based on quarks and gluons and have no clear connection to the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the qcd dynamics at high energies and large nuclei predicts the formation of a new state of matter , called color glass condensate ( for a review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , characterized by the saturation scale @xmath8 , which is the typical momentum scale in the hadron wave function .",
    "the presence of this scale , which increases with energy and the atomic number , allows to treat hadron production on a solid theoretical basis , where perturbative methods can be applied . in the last years",
    ", the framework of the cgc approach have been used to describe with success the experimental data for the hadron production . in high energy collisions",
    "we expect to observe the transition from a linear description of the qcd dynamics , based on the dglap  @xcite and/or bfkl  @xcite evolution equations , to a nonlinear description based on the color glass condensate formalism @xcite .",
    "the transition between these two regimes is determined by the saturation scale @xmath8 , which grows with the energy and atomic number . in the last years",
    "a comprehensive phenomenological analysis has been carried out to understand the hera , rhic and lhc data @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies have improved the cgc formalism by the inclusion of higher order corrections @xcite . in particular , the running coupling corrections to the kernel of the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite were calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the solution being able to describe several observables at hera , rhic and lhc .",
    "more recently , the contributions of large single and double transverse momentum logarithms have been resummed to all orders and included in the bk equation @xcite , with the resulting evolution equation being stable and generating a physically meaningful evolution of the dipole amplitude .",
    "in addition , the formalism of single inclusive hadron production in the framework of the hybrid approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite has been improved by the inclusion of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections in refs .",
    "@xcite , and a generalization to higher orders of the @xmath0 - factorization formalism for inclusive gluon production was conjectured in ref .",
    "as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nlo corrections of the hybrid formalism bring a better agreement of the predictions with the lhc and rhic data on forward hadron production .",
    "in contrast , the impact of the higher order corrections in the @xmath0 - factorization formalism on observables is still unknown .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the @xmath0 - factorization formalism of gluon production in the central rapidity region ( where the wave functions of both colliding particles are probed in the small - x regime ) has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been derived in the leading @xmath9 and fixed coupling approximations in ref .",
    "@xcite , considering the scattering of a dilute parton system on a dense one ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "kharzeev , levin and nardi ( kln ) have studied particle production at midrapidities in @xmath1 collisions in terms of the @xmath0 - factorization formalism .",
    "they have assumed that the main properties of hadron production , as for example the energy , rapidity and transverse momentum dependence , are determined in the initial stage of the collision by the interaction between gluons with transverse momentum of the order of the saturation scale @xmath8 .",
    "the presence of this scale regularizes the infrared behavior of the parton transverse momentum distributions and justifies a perturbative approach to the process .",
    "since the basic predictions of the kln approach have been qualitatively confirmed by rhic and lhc data , several authors have improved the kln formalism in order to obtain a quantitative description of these data . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite , different models of the unintegrated gluon distribution and/or distinct treatments of the nuclear geometry have been considered .",
    "although the @xmath0 - factorization formula has been derived assuming that @xmath10 is a constant , these different phenomenological studies have considered the running of the coupling constant and verified that it leads to an improvement of the agreement between theory and data . however , analysing in more detail these distinct predictions , we can observe that they were obtained using different choices of scale for the running coupling constant .",
    "such uncertainty is expected in a leading order calculation , where the scales of the couplings are not known .",
    "consequently , the inclusion of running coupling corrections in inclusive gluon production is an important step to obtain quantitative predictions with higher accuracy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have calculated the running coupling corrections for the lowest - order gluon production cross section using the scale - setting prescription due to brodsky , lepage and mackenzie ( blm ) @xcite .",
    "they found that the resulting cross section is expressed in terms of seven factors with running couplings , instead of the three present in the fixed coupling calculation .",
    "in particular , two of these running couplings run with complex - valued momentum scales , which are complex conjugates of each other , implying real production cross sections .",
    "finally , this calculation fixes the scales of the running coupling constants appearing in the cross section .",
    "based on these results for lowest - order gluon production , the authors have proposed a running coupling corrected @xmath0 - factorization formula , which is expected to be valid in the same regime as the original fixed order formula . although the proof of this formula is still an open question , it is expected that the resulting formula may still be a good approximation for the exact answer .",
    "such expectation motivates the phenomenological analysis performed in this paper . in what follows",
    "we will compare the predictions of the running coupling @xmath0 - factorization formula with those obtained assuming a fixed coupling constant and two different prescriptions for the inclusion of the running coupling in the leading order formula . in all calculations",
    "we will use the same model of the unintegrated gluon distribution and we will use the same prescription for hadronization . moreover , we will consider a simplified treatment of the nuclear geometry .",
    "this procedure allows us to estimate more precisely the impact of the running coupling corrections on the @xmath0 - factorization formula .",
    "such aspects surely can and should be improved in a quantitative comparison of the formalism with the experimental data .",
    "however , we believe that our main conclusions will not be strongly modified .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will present a brief review of the @xmath0 - factorization formalism and discuss the different prescriptions for the treatment of the coupling constant which will be considered in our analysis . in section [ res ] , the kln model of the unintegrated gluon distribution",
    "will be presented as well as the basic formulas for the calculation of the observables .",
    "moreover , we will compute the pseudo - rapidity and energy distributions measured in hadron production in @xmath1 collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "we will use the running coupling @xmath0 - factorization formula and compare its predictions with those obtained assuming a fixed coupling constant and two different prescriptions for the inclusion of the running coupling in the leading order formula .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we will discuss inclusive gluon production in the @xmath11-factorization formalism . before presenting the main formulas ,",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "as described in the introduction , the cross section of this process was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and proven in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) considering the scattering of a dilute partonic system on a dense one at fixed coupling constant and in leading @xmath9 approximation .",
    "consequently , its application is well justified for gluon production at midrapidity in @xmath12 collisions . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath7 collisions at high energies ,",
    "the gluon jet at midrapidities is produced by the interaction of two dense systems . in such cases ,",
    "factorization breaking effects are expected to become significant @xcite , modifying the basic @xmath11-factorization formulas .",
    "however , the magnitude of these corrections is still subject of intense debate and its contribution in the kinematical range probed by the lhc is not well known .",
    "the fact that the @xmath11-factorization formalism allows us to obtain a very good description of the current data , suggests that these corrections are not large and that this formalism can be considered a reasonable approximation for the treatment of gluon production in @xmath2 and @xmath7 collisions at central rapidities .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will apply the @xmath11-factorization formalism to @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath7 collisions .",
    "let us consider the production of a gluon with momentum @xmath0 at rapidity @xmath13 in a collision between the hadrons @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "in the @xmath11-factorization formalism , the differential cross section for this process will be given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total rapidity interval of the collision , @xmath20 and boldface variables denote transverse plane vectors , @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 denotes the so - called unintegrated gluon distribution , which represents the probability to find a gluon with momentum fraction @xmath23 and transverse momentum @xmath24 in the hadron @xmath25 .",
    "this distribution can be expressed as follows @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the dipole - hadron @xmath25 forward scattering amplitude for a gluon dipole of transverse size @xmath28 and @xmath29 the impact parameter of the scattering .",
    "the behavior of @xmath30 at large rapidities ( small - @xmath31 ) is directly related to the qcd dynamics at high energies . in the general case",
    ", it will be given by the solution of the jimwlk evolution equation @xcite , but in the large-@xmath32 limit it can be expressed in terms of the solution of the bk equation @xcite for the quark dipole - hadron forward scattering amplitude . as the numerical solution of these equations including",
    "the impact parameter dependence is still very challenging @xcite , in the studies of gluon production using @xmath0 - factorization formula the authors have introduced simplifying assumptions about the impact parameter dependence of the phenomenological models for the unintegrated gluon distributions ( or about the quark dipole scattering amplitude ) , which are based on cgc physics and have their parameters constrained by experimental data @xcite .    in the @xmath0 - factorization formula ,",
    "( [ ktfact ] ) , the cross section is proportional to the coupling constant @xmath10 , which was assumed to be constant in its derivation .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 appears also in the unintegrated gluon distribution , eq .",
    "( [ ktgluea ] ) . in the last years , running coupling corrections have been calculated for the bk - jimwlk evolution equations and this allows us to estimate the contribution of these corrections to @xmath30 .",
    "however , it is still not clear how to determine the momentum scale in @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ ktgluea ] ) .",
    "this has motivated the generalization of eqs .",
    "( [ ktfact ] ) and ( [ ktgluea ] ) by the inclusion of running coupling constant corrections @xcite . in general",

    "( [ ktfact ] ) and ( [ ktgluea ] ) depend on different momentum scales .",
    "the choice of these scales is arbitrary and we found different choices in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref .",

    "( [ ktfact ] ) and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ ktgluea ] ) . on the other hand , in ref .",

    "( [ ktfact ] ) , with @xmath36 , and the scale of running coupling in eq .",
    "( [ ktgluea ] ) is assumed to be equal to the transverse momentum of the gluon .",
    "a common characteristic of these approaches is that they assume the leading order running coupling @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a non - perturbative scale and @xmath39 is the number of fermions .",
    "moreover , very often a smooth freezing of the coupling at low scales is assumed .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the strong coupling is taken to be @xmath40 when @xmath41 gev@xmath42 . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of running coupling corrections improves the description of the experimental data .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not clear that eq .",
    "( [ ktfact ] ) will keep its factorized form after the inclusion of these corrections . in order to clarify this aspect ,",
    "the authors of @xcite have estimated the running coupling corrections in lowest - order gluon production cross section , finding that three factors of fixed coupling in lowest - order expression should be replaced by seven running couplings , with the new structure being called the _ septumvirate _ of couplings .",

    "<S> the inclusive gluon production at midrapidities is described in the color glass condensate formalism using the @xmath0 - factorization formula , which was derived at fixed coupling constant considering the scattering of a dilute system of partons with a dense one . </S>",
    "<S> recent analysis demonstrated that this approach provides a satisfactory description of the experimental data for the inclusive hadron production in @xmath1 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> however , these studies are based on the fixed coupling @xmath0 - factorization formula , which does not take into account the running coupling corrections , which are important to set the scales present in the cross section . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the running coupling corrected @xmath0 - factorization formula conjectured some years ago and investigate the impact of the running coupling corrections on the observables . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the pseudorapidity distributions and charged hadrons multiplicity are calculated considering @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions at rhic and lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the corrected running coupling predictions with those obtained using the original @xmath0 - factorization assuming a fixed coupling or a prescription for the inclusion of the running of the coupling . considering the kharzeev - levin - nardi unintegrated gluon distribution and a simplified model for the nuclear geometry , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the distinct predictions are similar for the pseudorapidity distributions in @xmath1 collisions and for the charged hadrons multiplicity in @xmath5 collisions . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the running coupling corrected @xmath0 - factorization formula predicts a smoother energy dependence for @xmath6 in @xmath7 collisions .    </S>",
