    "the negativity of the single interval and the two adjacent interval cases is determined by conformal symmetry .",
    "another special case where the negativity can be determined , at least for @xmath5 , is a massless free scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions . in this case , the @xmath3-sheeted partition functions are known in terms of riemann - siegel theta functions although it is not known in general how to continue the result away from integer @xmath5 and in particular to @xmath6 .",
    "since the partial transposed reduced density matrix is gaussian , the negativity for a free scalar can be checked through a lattice computation by using wick s theorem @xcite .",

    "the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix is no longer gaussian but a sum of two , generically non - commuting , gaussian matrices @xcite : @xmath7 ( we will define @xmath8 in section [ sec : bg ] . ) this fact brings additional complication to both the lattice and field theoretical calculations . on the lattice side , eigenvalues of @xmath9",
    "can not be simply derived from eigenvalues of a covariance matrix as in the gaussian case . in a field theory setting , one has to sum over partition functions with different spin structure , corresponding to different terms in the expansion of @xmath10 .",
    "various efforts have been made to tame the difficulties in deriving the negativity of free fermions : on the lattice side , algebraic simplification and numerical diagonalization of products of these two gaussian matrices yields the @xmath11 moments of negativity for the two disjoint interval case @xcite .",
    "( monte - carlo and tensor network methods have also been used to calculate negativity for the ising model @xcite which , although not identical to the dirac fermion , is closely related . ) the analytical form of such moments are derived by evaluation of the corresponding path integrals @xcite .",
    "however in the existing results the sheet number @xmath3 does not appear as a continuous variable ; it remains an open problem how to take the @xmath2 limit to get the negativity .    in this letter we shall introduce a @xmath0-symmetric free fermion with specific choice of spin structure .",
