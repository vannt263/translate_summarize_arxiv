    "an obscuring dusty structure surrounding an accreting massive black hole ( bh ) is believed to be a common feature of most active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . since the obscuration of the central region is anisotropic , sources with small inclination angles to the line of sight ( face - on ) would be classified as type - i agns and those with large inclination angles ( edge - on ) would be classified as type - ii agns . in this picture , the bulk of the radiation from the central engine is absorbed by the obscuring structure and re - emitted mainly in mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths .",
    "the central obscuration is not necessarily a single component structure and the exact nature of its different components remains an open question and provides the motivation to the present work .    a main component of the obscuring structure",
    "is believed to be a dusty torus .",
    "the mir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of such torus depends on its dimensions and geometry , the density distribution and the dust grain properties .",
    "initial attempts to model such tori assumed smooth density distributions ( e.g. pier & krolik 1992 ; 1993 ; granato & danese 1994 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; van bemmel & dullemond 2003 ; schartmann et al .",
    "this can explain part of the sed but falls short of providing realistic mir spectra .",
    "for example , silicate emission has been detected in type-2 agns ( e.g. sturm et al .",
    "2006 ; teplitz et al .",
    "2006 ) despite of the the fact that absorption features are expected in edge - on tori .",
    "several studies suggested that the dusty medium should be clumpy ( e.g. krolik & begelman 1988 ; rowan - robinson 1995 ; nenkova et al .",

    "( 2008a ; 2008b ; hereafter n08 ) offer the required formalism to calculate the sed of such tori and a framework to constrain some of their properties .",
    "other agn components can contribute to the observed mir spectrum of agns .",
    "some of this emission may originate farther from the central radiation source , at distances exceeding the dimensions of the torus .",
    "broad - band 10  imaging of several nearby agns suggests extended mir continuum source ( cameron et al .",

    "this component is subtracted from the observed spectra using the mir spectrum of m82 in a way similar to the one used in s06 .",

    "more details are given in s06 and in ",
    "[ sec_model_fit ] .",
    "this section describes the spectral properties of the three components and the following sections give detailed account of the fitting procedure .",
    "the first component represents a dusty torus surrounding the central energy source .",
    "agn unification schemes suggest that the central engine is surrounded by dusty , optically thick , toroidal structure ( e.g. , krolik & begelman 1988 ; antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "earlier torus models assumed a smooth density distribution ( pier & krolik 1992 ; rowan - robinson 1995 ; van - bemmel & dullemond 2003 ) .",
    "they all suffer from various incompletions and their agreement with mir spectral observations is generally poor .",
    "the more recent clumpy torus models of n08 represent a significant improvement and are the basis for the present study .",
    "the fundamental difference between clumpy and smooth density distributions is that the former allows the radiation to propagate freely between different regions of the optically thick medium .",
    "the clumpy dust distribution results in the coexistence of clouds with a range of dust temperatures at the same distance from the central radiation source .",
    "they also allow clouds at large distances to be exposed to the direct agn continuum .",
    "in contrast , smooth density distribution models associate a certain dust temperature with a certain distance from the central source , thus limiting the range of acceptable seds .",
    "these differences allow the clumpy torus models to have a range of spectral properties not accessible in smooth density distribution torus models .",
    "n08 describe the formalism and the detailed radiative transfer used to calculate the mir spectrum of clumpy dusty tori and our use of the torus models follows the same procedure .",
    "the first parameter of the clumpy torus model is the inner radius of the cloud distribution that is set to the dust sublimation radius @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to a dust sublimation temperature @xmath15 that depends on the grain properties and mixture .",
    "here we adopt two different sublimation radii appropriate for two types of grains .",
    "the first is @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "this gives the innermost radius where graphite dust can survive .",
    "it corresponds to a sublimation temperature of about 1800k and is the one used in s08 .",
    "n08 adopted a somewhat larger distance , which is more appropriate for silicate type grains with a sublimation temperature of 1500k .",
    "this is given by @xmath18 in the following we specify which of the two is used for each purpose .",
    "the clumpy torus model requires six additional parameters :    1 .",
    "the visual ( 5500 ) dust optical depth of a single cloud ,  ( all clouds are assumed to have the same ) .",
    "2 .   the mean number of clouds along a radial equatorial line , @xmath19 .",
    "3 .   the ratio between the outer dimension of the torus and @xmath14 , y. 4 .",
    "the inclination angle of the torus with respect to the line of sight , @xmath20 .",
    "the torus width parameter @xmath21 , which is analogues to its opening angle .",
    "a parameter q that specifies the radial power - law distribution of the clouds , i.e. @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of clouds .",
    "n08 also define an additional parameter that is set by the above free parameters .",
    "this is the probability @xmath24 that light from the central source will escape the obscuring structure at a given angle @xmath25 without interacting with the clouds . assuming that individual clouds are optically thick @xmath26 where @xmath27 . by integrating @xmath28 over all angles and subtracting from 1",
    ", we obtain the probability of absorption by the torus .",
    "@xmath29 this is also the fraction of obscured objects in a random sample ( e.g. the fraction of type - ii agns out of the entire agn population ) .",
    "@xmath30 is equivalent to the  real \" ( geometrical ) covering factor of the torus , and _ does not _",
    "depend on the inclination angle since it reflects the global torus geometry .",
    "in other words , @xmath30 is the ratio between the total torus luminosity and . due to the anisotropy of the torus radiation",
    ", @xmath30 differs from the _ apparent _ covering factor of the torus deduced from the ratio between its observed ( angle dependent ) luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of the central source .",
    "this apparent covering factor can be represented by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angle dependent monochromatic luminosity of the torus . for a more detailed description of all torus parameters , as well as other model properties and assumptions ,",
    "see n08 .",
    "the emission and absorption properties of the torus depend on the dust grains composition and other properties .",
    "all models consider here assume spherical dust grains with mrn size distribution ( mathis , rumple & nordsieck 1977 ) .",
    "the dust has a standard galactic mix of 53% silicates and 47% graphite .",
    "the optical properties of graphite are taken from draine ( 2003 ) and for silicates from ossenkopf , hennig & mathis ( 1992 ) ( ohm ) .",
    "the ohm dust mixture produces better agreement with observations of the 10 and 18 silicate features ( sirocky et al .",
    "2008 ) and is the only one used in the present work .        the second component of the model represents a collection of dusty nlr clouds . the motivation for this component",
    "is explained in s08 where it was shown that such a component can contribute , significantly , to the mir flux of luminous agns .",
    "the properties assumed here for these clouds are similar to the ones used in s08 .",
    "we assume constant column density clouds with @xmath33 .",
    "we further assume constant hydrogen density of 10@xmath34 , solar composition and galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the important physical parameters for this component are the cloud - central source distance ( which determines the dust temperature ) , the incident sed and the dust column density .",
    "the assumed gas density and column density only serve to define the emission from this component using convenient parameters such as the ionization parameter .",
    "the nlr component is assumed to be concentrated in a thin spherical shell with a small covering fraction .",
    "these assumptions ( that are reviewed later ) mean that a _ single _",
    "thin shell with the chosen properties is contributing to any 3-component model .",
    "the calculations of the emitted ir continuum of the clouds , as well as their emission line spectrum , are obtained with the photoionization code ion ( netzer 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the assumed sed of the central continuum is the one described in s08 and the resulting nlr spectra are similar to those shown in s08 fig .  1 .",
    "the clouds are optically thin to mir radiation and hence no radiative transfer is required for the calculations of this emission .",
    "obviously , this is not the case for the uv part of the spectrum where the opacity is much larger and where the transfer approximation we use is the one built into ion .",
    "the third component is a single bb representing hot dust emission .",
    "the need for such a component has been noticed in earlier works , e.g. in s08 .",
    "this is very clear from the data , where a rise towards short wavelengths can be seen from the irs spectra even without the supplemented nir photometry .",
    "the simplified bb assumption is not entirely consistent with hot dust clouds illuminated from one side since for large dust optical depth , there must be a temperature gradient across such clouds . for small dust optical depth , the dust temperature is more uniform but the cloud may be partly transparent to the incident radiation . for the purpose of the present study , we assume that all the incident optical - uv radiation is absorbed by this component and the dust temperature is constant .",
    "we discuss this component further in  [ sec_res_3_components ] and  [ sec_dis_bb_properties ] below .      as shown in s08 and explained in detail in netzer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the starburst contribution to the mir spectrum can be significant , especially at long wavelengths . to remove this contribution ,",
    "we follow the procedure of s08 who fitted and subtracted a `` nominal '' m82 spectrum from all spectra prior to the model fitting .",
    "we use the iso - sws mid - ir spectrum of m82 from sturm et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the scaling factors of s08 that were obtained from the intensity of the strong pah emission features that are clearly seen in some of our objects .",
    "although this component is subtracted prior to the model fitting , its normalization introduces another degree of freedom to the procedure .",
    "the remaining spectra are assumed to represent the intrinsic agn continuum .",
    "the fitting procedure minimizes the modified , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath37 is the starburst subtracted luminosity deduced from the observed monochromatic flux density at rest wavelength @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the combined emission due to all three components , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are fitting parameters .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the source uniquely determine the total emergent flux of the torus component through the radiative transfer calculation .",
    "since an independent measure of the bolometric luminosity is available for these type - i sources , the normalization of the torus component is _ not _ a free parameter of the fitting procedure ( i.e. the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : fmodel ] is set by the torus parameters but the total energy emitted by the torus is fixed .    to reduce the uncertainty",
    ", we first bin the observed spectra into @xmath3100 bins of equal energy widths and take in each the mean observed flux .",
    "the torus , nlr and bb models are then interpolated to the same energy grid .",
    "the binning of the data practically removes all emission lines and smooth the spectrum , allowing to focus on the broad band continuum shape .",
    "some remaining peaks may result in larger local  values but since none of the models contains lines , the effect would be the same for all fits .    according to s08 ,",
    "most of the errors in the irs spectra are systematic and are approximately  10% of the flux .",
    "we add this systematic error to the standard deviation of the data points in each energy bin to get the value of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ eq : chi2 ] .",
    "this is taken to represent the error on the observed binned flux .",
    "the use of this @xmath21 affects the derived such that its absolute value is different from the one normally used in statistical analysis .",
    "however , the relative value of  can still be used to discriminate between different models and will be treated as such in the remaining of the paper .",
    "the fitting algorithm computes  values for all possible combinations of torus , nlr and bb models .",
    "there are six free parameters in the torus model that describe its geometrical properties ( see section  [ sec_spectral_comp ] ) .",
    "the radial extent of the torus , y , ranges from 5 to 60 @xmath14 .",

    "there are two free parameters , the cloud distance and the normalization factor @xmath41 .",
    "the distance is changed in steps of 0.075 dex between 1 pc to 850 pc for a source with @xmath50 .",
    "for the hot bb , there are also two free parameters , temperature and a normalization factor @xmath42 .",
    "the range in temperatures is 8001800  k.",
    "we first examine the possibility that single torus models can explain the observed spectrum .",
    "this is important in order to evaluate the general properties of clumpy tori models and has never been attempted on large -irs samples . in general , allowing for a torus - only model results in large  and poor fit to almost all spectra . on average ,  values of such fits",
    "are about an order of magnitude larger than those obtained by using all three components .",
    "none of the torus models could fit well the full observed spectrum of any of the objects .",
    "the best torus - only models are those fitted to the spectra of pg  1626 + 554 , pg  1004 + 130 and pg  0838 + 770 .",

    "the three additional partial  criteria are aimed to identify those fits where a certain part of the spectrum is not fitted well even though the global  is within the above mention range . for this , we examine the goodness of the fit in three different parts of the spectrum by calculating  values for the ranges @xmath56 , @xmath57  and @xmath58 .",

    "this value determines , more than any of the other parameters , the geometrical covering factor ( @xmath30 ) of the torus and is consistent with the expected type - i : type - ii ratio ( see below ) .",
    "the mean radial extent of the torus , y , has a broad distribution with a mean value of 31 .",
    "the range in y implies torus outer sizes , which range from @xmath31 to 35 pc using @xmath62 and @xmath33 to 90 pc using @xmath63 .",
    "3 .   the average number of clouds along an equatorial ray , @xmath19 , has a broad distribution with a mean of 5 clouds .",
    "the distribution is practically uniform for @xmath64 .",
    "4 .   the parameter that specifies the radial power - law distribution of the clouds , q , has a mean value of 1 .",
    "this parameter is related to the anisotropy of the torus radiation .",
    "as q decreases the torus radiation becomes less isotropic .",
    "the sed shape is affected less by q and hence we do not attach great significance to its specific value . 5 .",
    "the mean optical depth of a cloud is = 58 .",
    "this parameter , again , has a broad distribution covering the range @xmath65 .",
    "since the requirement for large mir optical depth is @xmath66 , it is not surprising that the torus models are not very sensitive to the exact value of  beyond this value .",
    "the torus inclination angle shows a broad distribution for all @xmath67 with a mean of @xmath68 .",
    "this again is consistent with the assumption that the direct line - of - sight to the center of type - i agns is almost completely free of obscuring material .",
    "as explained , sed related uncertainties , in particular the bolometric luminosity of the sources , make it difficult to determine the exact torus properties in individual objects .",

    "this is in contrast to previous theoretical works involving smooth density distribution torus models . in these models ,",
    "the torus is required to be much larger ( up to few hundreds of pc ) in order to posses the large amounts of cool dust necessary for producing the observed mir emission .",

    "in contrast , the clumpy torus model enables emission from cool dust clouds that are much closer to the center thus able of producing the required mir emission with much smaller dimensions .",

    "schmitt et al .",
    "works are based on detailed hst imaging of agn samples that are of the same redshift range as the one considered here .",
    "our dust temperature - based dimensions are smaller by a factor of @xmath96 compared with these imaging - based estimates .",
    "this is not surprising since our estimates are biased toward those nlr clouds that have the largest covering factor for the hottest dust clouds .",
    "the discrepancy suggests that real nlrs , i.e. those with a range of dust temperatures contribute more to the longer wavelength part of the spectrum . furthermore , netzer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggested that the bennert et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimates are considerably larger than  real \" nlr sizes for two reasons .",
    "the first is that the @xmath97 dependence must break down at some intermediate luminosity since extrapolating this relation to high luminosity objects would result in nlr dimensions that exceed the host galaxy dimension .",
    "the second reason is that bennert et al .",
    "( 2002 ) measured image sizes that encompasses more than 98% of the detectable  emission .",
    "a 90% or 95% intensity limits can lead to much smaller dimensions .",
    "baskin & laor ( 2005 ) used a different method to estimate the distances to 40 nlrs in the boroson & green ( 1992 ) sample .",
    "they fitted the observed intensities of the [ ]  @xmath385007 , [ ]  @xmath384363  and  narrow emission lines using two different models .",
    "the first , assumed a single uniform , [ ]  @xmath385007  emitting region .",
    "this resulted in @xmath98 and a very large mean gas density of @xmath99 .",
    "these dimensions are smaller than those found by bennert et al .",
    "the second model assumed two emitting regions : a low , constant gas density ( @xmath100 ) region where most of the [ ]  @xmath385007  originates and a high , constant gas density ( @xmath101 ) region where most of the [ ]  @xmath384363  originates .",
    "for the low density region they found @xmath102 and for the high density region @xmath103 .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath385007  dimensions are comparable to those of bennert et al .",
    "it is clear that single - zone and even two - zone nlr models are highly simplified .",
    "moreover , dimension deduced from a narrow line intensity is uncertain since the gas density is changing across the nlr and in general @xmath104 .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the nlr size obtained from such estimates spans a very large range .    the m82 starburst template subtracted from the spectra could , in principle , have an effect on the calculated nlr properties , e.g. a different template could have larger contribution towards shorter wavelengths ( @xmath330 ) .",
    "consequently , the nlr component would have less weight and different spectral shape that would result in larger nlr distances .",
    "we regard this possibility as an additional uncertainty on the determination of the nlr distance .    in conclusion ,",
    "our hot dust measure of the nlr size is based on a method different than the direct imaging method and the photoionization modelling method .",
    "while further discussion of those discrepancies is beyond the scope of the present paper , the main conclusion is that simple , dusty nlr clouds ( or single nlr shells ) at the distances found above , in combination with the two other model components , can adequately fit the 235  spectrum of the quest agns .",
    "the @xmath105 wavelength range is dominated by the hot bb component of our model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : relative_cont ] ) . on average ,",
    "the luminosity of this component is about 40% of the total @xmath106 luminosity and is comparable to the luminosity radiated by the clumpy torus .",
    "the mean bb temperature is 1400 k and the distribution of temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bb_temp_dist ] .",
    "while such a large contribution is evident in all of the sources , the physical origin of this component is not yet clear .",
    "clumpy tori of the type considered here can not produce more than one luminosity bump . since most of the torus radiation peaks at 520",
    ", the short wavelength excess can not result from this structure .",
    "the conclusion is that the assumed bb must be a separate component .",
    "we have considered several possible explanations for the hot bb component .",
    "the first is a contribution from old stellar population near the galactic center . to examine this",
    ", we use m_bh @xmath88  to estimate the host galaxy luminosity using the scaling relations of lauer et al .",
    "( 2007 ; see their eq .",
    "3 ) . to convert visual magnitudes to k  band magnitudes we use ( v - k)=3.2 typical of giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. grasdalen 1980 ) .",
    "this k  band luminosity was compared to the luminosity of the bb found here . in all cases ,",
    "the bb component is about a factor 10 more luminous than the derived k  band luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , such a stellar population would not have sufficient luminosity to account for the observed 27  flux .",
    "the space distribution of such an old stellar population is another limitation .",
    "broad band monitoring of several nearby , intermediate luminosity agn clearly show k - band variations on time scales of weeks to months ( e.g. , suganuma et al .",
    "this has been interpreted as changes in the temperature of the innermost dust , just beyond the sublimation radius .",
    "given the great similarity between the 235  spectrum of the present sample and the spectra of those variable agns , we conclude that the origin of the k and the l - band emission , in the present sample and the above agn sample , is the same .",
    "such dimensions are clearly too small for the assumed stellar population . needless to say , any k or l - band variations are inconsistent with stellar population properties .",
    "another strong source of radiation is starburst activity in the host galaxy .",
    "the ir emission from starburst , however , is expected to peak at much larger wavelengths .",
    "s06 found a strong correlation between the strength of the pah feature at 7.7  and the continuum luminosity at 60 . the same trend is found in starburst dominated ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; see fig.4 in s08 ) .",
    "thus , luminosity produced by starburst in the quest sample dominates the far - ir part of the spectrum and can not account for the hot dust component .",
    "another possibility that has already been mentioned is that the new component represents emission by very hot dust , which is not a part of the clumpy torus structure . as explained in  [ sec_res_3_components ] , we could not fit the observations assuming single hot dust clouds of the same grain composition as the torus .",
    "the reason is that such clouds produce extremely strong 10  emission .",
    "this is not the case for pure graphite dust that has no prominent features at mir wavelengths .",
    "graphite dust grains can survive at the bb temperatures found here and provide a suitable explanation for the bb component",
    ". the location of this dust can be inside the silicate sublimation radius but still outside the dust - free broad line region .",
    "a full discussion of this possibility , including realistic hot graphite grains spectra , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally we note that the above suggested location , close or even inside the silicate dust sublimation radius , is also problematic from the point of view of the derived covering factors .",
    "our calculations assume no obscuration of one component by another yet such a location must obscure some of the radiation impinging on the torus .",
    "the location of these clouds imply that the radiation incident upon the torus should change and include part of the re - emitted radiation from the bb component .",
    "given the unknown properties of the hot bb component , we can not take this into account within the framework of the present work .",
    "a major assumption of this work is that the entire mir spectrum , after starburst subtraction , is reprocessed agn radiation .",
    "this can be used to deduce the covering factor of the central source by the three components ( see also s08 and references therein ; maiolino et al .",
    "2007 ) . regarding the bb and the nlr components ,",
    "this factor is obtained directly from the comparison of their deduced luminosities with .",
    "the covering factor of the torus , @xmath30 , is different because of its non - isotropic radiation . for a given model",
    ", @xmath30 is calculated from the torus parameters . to demonstrate these differences , we compare in table  [ tab_modeling_components_cf ] , @xmath30 , @xmath75 , and the covering factors of the nlr and the bb components .",
    "the total covering factor can be defined in two ways : * 1 . *",
    "apparent total covering factor , defined as @xmath107 .",
    "this is similar to the number used in all earlier investigations of this type .",
    "since the _ spitzer_-irs spectra extend only to @xmath335 , we use the mean  intrinsic \" agn sed of netzer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , obtained from the starburst subtracted quest spectra , to calculate the ratio between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this ratio is 1.072 and thus we multiply @xmath109 of each object by this factor to get its apparent total covering factor .",
    "real total covering factor , calculated by summing together @xmath30 and the nlr and bb covering factors .",
    "the various covering factor distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf_all ] .",
    "the mean value of @xmath30 is 0.27 .",
    "this value is lower than the @xmath75 , for which the mean value is 0.34 .",
    "the difference is due to the anisotropy of the torus radiation and the fact that , for the present sample of type - i sources , the torus inclination angle is small .",
    "the mean covering factor of the nlr component is 0.07 .",
    "this is in agreement with other estimates that are based on narrow emission line imaging and line equivalent width measurements , which suggest nlr covering factor @xmath110% ( e.g. , baskin & laor 2005 ; netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "the mean covering factor of the bb component is 0.23 .",

    "visual inspection of the bottom left panel shows that , without the two sources , the geometrical covering factor ( @xmath30+bb ) decreases with  and its highest value , at the low luminosity end , is roughly 0.7 , in agreement with typical assumed distributions between type - i and type - ii agn in the local universe .",
    "several earlier studies found clear anti - correlation between covering factor and ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2005 ; richards et al . 2006 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2007 ; treister et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the decrease in covering factor translates , within the unification scheme , to a decreasing fraction of obscured agns as a function of luminosity .",
    "all earlier studies were based on the total mir emission and took no account of the various contributers to the flux and the fact that the geometrical covering factor can not be obtained , directly , from l(ir)/. our results are consistent with these studies but take into account , more accurately , the exact torus geometry and the needed translation between observed ir flux and geometrical structure .",
    "they show that @xmath111 of the derived covering factor is due to nlr clouds and properly account for the inclination angle distribution within the clumpy torus scenario . taking the values found here",
    "we conclude that for @xmath112 there is roughly 1:1 ratio between type - i and type - ii sources ( note that the nlr contribution is subtracted from the total covering factor ) . both maiolino et al .",

    "one possibility is a receding torus mentioned above , where higher luminosity implies larger dust sublimation distance , and hence an obscuring structure that is located farther away from the center . in this scenario , the obscuring structure must have a constant height . in the clumpy torus model this scenario corresponds to a decrease of @xmath21 with . indeed , we find that @xmath21 is anti - correlated with the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we also find a positive correlation between the inclination angle of the torus and the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this is also consistent with a receding torus .",
    "an obscuring structure located at a larger distance , in this scenario , implies a larger solid angle through which an unobscured view to the center is possible .",
    "thus , the luminosity of the source determines the possible range of inclination angles in which the model would be consistent with a type - i agn sed .",
    "since there is no preference to a specific angle within that range , the correlation is due to the expansion of the possible range in @xmath20 with increasing luminosity .      given the torus parameters , we can estimate the torus mass from @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the column density of a single cloud in units of @xmath115  obtained from  and the assumed dust - to - gas ratio .",

    "this is an extremely short duration of about @xmath125 .",
    "this time scale is similar for all sources and is independent of torus mass , source luminosity and any of the other properties .",
    "the typical e - folding time for a bh mass of 10@xmath126  and the above @xmath127 is about @xmath128 .",
    "this mean that , if all accretion to the center goes through the torus , there are more than 100 short accretion episodes per one e - folding growth time .",
    "the above result indicates at least two different possibilities : * 1 . * a constant replenishment of the torus material by larger scale mass inflow through the plane of the torus .",
    "such a scenario , requires a constantly changing torus structure .",
    "* matter accreting onto the bh does not originate in the torus .",
    "such a scenario has been suggested by elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) , who assumed that mass from the host galaxy arrives directly into the accretion disk .",

    "<S> we fitted _ spitzer_/irs @xmath0 spectra of 26 luminous qsos in attempt to define the main emission components . </S>",
    "<S> our model has three major components : a clumpy torus , dusty narrow line region ( nlr ) clouds and a blackbody - like dust . </S>",
    "<S> the models utilize the clumpy torus of nenkova et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2008 ) and are the first to allow its consistent check in type - i agns . </S>",
    "<S> single torus models and combined torus - nlr models fail to fit the spectra of most sources but three component models adequately fit the spectra of all sources . </S>",
    "<S> we present torus inclination , cloud distribution , covering factor and torus mass for all sources and compare them with bolometric luminosity , black hole mass and accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> the torus covering factor and mass are found to be correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a substantial amount of the @xmath1 radiation originates from a hot dust component , which likely situated in the innermost part of the torus . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity radiated by this component and its covering factor are comparable to those of the torus . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the emission by the nlr clouds and estimate their distance from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the distances are @xmath2 times larger than the dust sublimation radius and the nlr covering factor is about 0.07 . </S>",
    "<S> the total covering factor by all components is in good agreement with the known agn type - i : type - ii ratio . </S>"
