    "these fields strongly affect the stability range for superconducting states with different vorticity in a spherical shell . in fig .",

    "[ fig7 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , an increase of the thickness of a spherical shell results in a well - pronounced shift of the boundaries between states with different vorticity towards higher magnetic fields @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath195 , the range of @xmath60 , where meissner states are thermodynamically stable , is more than two times wider in the case of @xmath196 as compared to the case of @xmath197 .",
    "one can also see that for a relatively thick spherical shell ( @xmath189 ) the boundary between giant vortex and @xmath50-multivortex states is shifted towards significantly larger values of @xmath79 as compared to those in the case of @xmath198 .",
    "the increased stability of giant vortex states agree with the results recently obtained by baelus _",
    "et al_. @xcite for the limit @xmath199 of a full sphere , in the framework of linearized ginzburg - landau equations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the phase boundaries for thermodynamically stable normal states , meissner states , single @xmath50-vortex , giant vortex , and @xmath138-multivortex state states are plotted in the @xmath200-plane .",
    "the results are shown for shells with different radius @xmath47 and thickness @xmath23 . in order to keep the plots more universal , it is convenient to express the thickness in units of @xmath201 . for thick nanoshells ,",
    "there is a much more pronounced increase of the transition fields , which correspond to a change of vorticity , with lowering temperature [ cp .",

    "[ fig5](a ) and  fig8(c ) ] . when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) to fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) one can also see that with increasing the nanoshell thickness the temperature range , where giant vortices are thermodynamically stable , extends towards lower temperatures . with decreasing the shell radius , this effect becomes quite pronounced even for relatively small values of @xmath202 $ ] [ cp .",

    "of course , when the temperature approaches @xmath154 , the phase boundaries become almost insensitive to the value of @xmath23 .",

    "the boundaries between the thermodynamically stable normal state , meissner state , single @xmath146-vortex state , giant vortex state , and @xmath146-multivortex states are shown by solid lines .",

    "curving a superconducting film into a spherical shell changes its vortex - related properties drastically due to topological constraints .",
    "the hairy - sphere theorem  @xcite is a straightforward example of such a constraint : it states that , in contrast to the situation on a flat film , there exists no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on the sphere .",
    "so , every nonvanishing supercurrent velocity field requires discontinuities , such as vortices .",
    "the interplay between the lorentz force due to an applied field and the vortex superflow will force these vortices away from the equator ( leaving an equatorial meissner band ) and towards the poles .",
    "this results in a ` polar trapping potential ' , which is nearly quadratic near the poles .",
    "when vortices conglomerate at the poles , they may coalesce to form giant or ring - like vortices , and these dynamics and phases are the topic of the present paper .",
    "three contributions to the energy should be kept in mind to interpret the phase diagrams obtained in our calculations .",
    "first , to create a vortex , the kinetic energy of the associated supercurrent ( on the 2d spherical surface ) should be taken into account .",
    "this contribution increases when two vortices with parallel vorticity are placed near each other , so it acts as a repulsion between the vortices .",
    "thus , it tends to favor splitting of the giant vortices .",
    "second , to create a vortex , the order parameter needs to be suppressed over a region typically of the size of the coherence length .",
    "the energy cost associated with this turns out to favor a multiply quantized ( giant ) vortex over the corresponding @xmath50-multivortex state .",
    "the energy cost is relatively larger for a smaller sphere , since proportionally a larger fraction of the total order parameter needs to be suppressed .",
    "the balance between these two energy contributions can be used to qualitatively understand the phase diagrams that we calculate for thin shells . indeed , for magnetic fields corresponding to multiple quanta of vorticity , the smaller spheres will favor giant vortices , whereas the larger spheres favor the @xmath206-multivortex state .",
    "note that this contribution to the energy strongly disfavors ring - like vortex states .",
    "the third contribution to the energy is related to the gradients in the magnetic field .",
    "when the shell is much thinner than the penetration depth , the currents on the shell will not substantially perturb the applied field , and this contribution plays no role .",
    "however , for thicker shells , this contribution does become important  as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the magnetic field is substantially perturbed .",
    "when a @xmath50-multivortex lattice is present , the magnetic field flux is concentrated near each vortex core , and shielded in between , leading to a larger magnetic contribution to the energy than for a giant vortex .",
    "thus , for a thick shell , this contribution will favor the giant vortex state .",
    "this agrees with our phase diagram showing that the region , where the giant vortex is stable , is growing for thicker shells .",
    "the temperature dependence of the phase diagrams was studied straightforwardly by taking temperature into account through the ginzburg - landau parameters .",
    "when multiple quanta of vorticity are present , we find that the giant vortex phase forms the preferred high - temperature phase .",
    "this offers the prospect of probing a temperature - driven transition between a giant vortex and a @xmath50-multivortex state , alongside with a magnetic - field driven transition .",
    "moreover , the vortex dynamics are shown to be not sensitive to moderate imperfections in the shell ; the energy contributions discussed here can overcome the pinning potential due to for example thickness inhomogeneities ",
    "such pinning potentials have in past experimental work hampered the detection of the giant vortex state .",
    "this robustness , together with the tunability of the phase diagram through a limited set of controllable parameters , makes superconducting nanoshells uniquely suited for the study of novel vortex states .",
