    "it is currently believed that structure in the universe formed with nearly scale - free initial conditions from quantum fluctuations during the early parts of the inflationary phase .",
    "subsequent growth of structure depends in part on the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) ; specifically if it is cold ( non - relativistic at the epoch of matter  radiation decoupling ) , as would be the case for axions , clustering proceeds hierarchically with small structures collapsing before large ones .",
    "the exact nature of this evolution depends on the cosmological parameters and the nature of the dm .",
    "if the dm is entirely collisionless and cold , halos are expected to form with a nearly universal profile , independent of the final mass of the halo .",
    "a specific functional form for this profile was proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , hereafter nfw ) on the basis of n - body simulations of hierarchical structure formation .    on a galaxy / sub - galaxy scale ,",
    "the nfw profile for dm halos has been severely challenged by observations of rotation curves of disk galaxies ( e.g. de blok et al .",
    "2001 ; borriello & salucci 2001 ) .",
    "the rotation curves of low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) , low - mass galaxies tend to rise significantly more slowly with radius than the nfw prediction .",
    "the burkert profile for dm halos was proposed to explain the rotation curves of four dwarf galaxies ( burkert 1995 ) , and appears to provide an excellent mass model for dm halos around disk systems up to 100 times more massive ( salucci & burkert 2000 ) . for the dm halos haboring elliptical galaxies ,",
    "keeton ( 2001 ) shows that the nfw profile is too concentrated to explain observed gravitational lensing .",
    "recently , borriello , salucci & danese ( 2002 ) show that the nfw profile is inconsistent with the fundamental plane ( fp ) , and that the fp can be successfully explained with the burkert profile . on a cluster scale ,",
    "wu & xue ( 2000 ) find that the burkert and nfw profiles provide almost indistinguishable fits to rosat cluster x - ray data .",
    "all this evidence suggests that the burkert profile is a @xmath0 candidate for the dm halos on both galaxy and cluster scales , though it was empirically proposed and its physical origin is less well understood than the nfw profile .",
    "gravitational lensing offers a promising way to distinguish the different proposed halo profiles . in this letter we present an analytical expression for the burkert - profile lens equation and",
    "show that this profile will produce strong lensing only for a certain combination of concentration index and lens  source distances .",
    "we find that burkert halos of any mass are unlikely to act as strong lenses unless the spiral - galaxy scaling relation between characteristic mass and density breaks down on larger mass scales , or other ( e.g. baryonic ) components of the object provide the cusp necessary for image splitting .    in @xmath1 2 , we present the lens equation for the burkert profile . in @xmath1 3",
    ", we explore the properties of the burkert lens and examine the implications of these properties . in @xmath1 4 ,",
    "we summarize and discuss the results . in this letter",
    ", we consider @xmath2cdm model : @xmath3 = 0.3 and @xmath4 with a hubble constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the burkert profile has a constant density core ( burkert 1995 ) : @xmath7},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are free parameters that represent the central dm density and the scale radius .",
    "the nfw profile has singularity at its center : @xmath10 at very large radii , two profiles coincide : @xmath11 .    in the thin lens approximation ,",
    "the lens equation for an axially symmetric mass profile is essentially one dimensional :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the redshifts of the lens and the source , and @xmath18 is the angular - diameter distance from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . and , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the positions of the source ( @xmath23 ) and the image , and @xmath24 is the projected mass enclosed within a projected radius @xmath25 :    @xmath26    the function @xmath27 can be worked out analytically : @xmath28 & ( x = 1 ) \\\\ \\ln \\frac{x}{2 } + \\frac{\\pi}{4}(\\sqrt{x^2 + 1 } -",

    "with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , one can write the dimensionless lens equation : @xmath32 with @xmath33 where the reduced angular - diameter distance @xmath34 is defined to be @xmath35 . in this letter",
    ", we use the angular diameter distance of the friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 determines all the properties of the burkert - profile lens .",
    "1 shows the lens equations for different values of @xmath36 . for @xmath37 ,",
    "burkert halos can not induce strong lensing .",
    "in contrast , the nfw halos can induce strong lensing for any @xmath36 .",
    "2 shows magnification @xmath38 of the burkert halos for different values of @xmath36 : @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , two peaks in the magnification curve correspond to the radial and tangential arcs respectively . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the magnification curves have the peak at @xmath42 .",
    "modeling strong lensing with the burkert halos requires @xmath43 , for which multiple images are formed only if the impact parameter @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 is the maximum of @xmath46 in the range @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "the cross section for strong lensing by the burkert halos is @xmath48 . if @xmath49 , then an einstein ring is formed at the radius @xmath50 , which is a positive solution of @xmath51 .",
    "( for a lens at @xmath52 with a scale radius @xmath53 , @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 . ) for @xmath56 , three images are formed .",
    "the separation between the two brighter images is @xmath57 .",
    "3 shows the critical impact parameter @xmath45 and the einstein radius @xmath50 as a function of @xmath36 for the burkert and nfw halos .",
    "while the impact parameter of the burkert halo is always less than that of the nfw halo for fixed @xmath36 , the image separation @xmath50 of the burkert halos becomes larger than that of the nfw halos when @xmath36 becomes greater than @xmath58 .",
    "the difference between the two profiles near @xmath59 leads to a dramatic difference in the cross section for strong lensing for a given image separation @xmath60 or @xmath50 . for small separations ( say , @xmath61 ) the impact parameter @xmath45 required for the burkert halo to induce splitting is considerably smaller than that of the nfw halo .",
    "for example , the ratios are @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 respectively ; the relative cross sections scale as @xmath65 .",
    "thus for the same distribution of @xmath9 , the lensing optical depth due to burkert halos is almost vanishingly small compared to that due to nfw halos .",
    "this is particularly true for lensing by galaxy - scale objects ; for example the probability for a qso image to be split by a single intervening giant elliptical galaxy is at least @xmath66 times smaller for a burkert profile than for an nfw profile , for the same @xmath9 and mass .",
    "this is not true for large image separations ( @xmath67 ) as might be the case for giant arcs formed by cluster - scale lenses .",
    "in this case the burkert halos yield optical depths comparable to the nfw halos , though slightly less ( by a factor @xmath68 to @xmath69 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath70 corresponds to restricted area in the ( @xmath71 ) parameter plane .",
    "the condition can be rephrased as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 in fig .",
    "4 we plot strong lensing demarcation curves : @xmath74 for @xmath75 . here , @xmath76 is the minimum of @xmath77 in the range @xmath78 .",
    "burkert halos with ( @xmath71 ) located above the demarcation curve for a given @xmath17 can induce strong lensing , those below the demarcation curve can not .    the rotation curves of late - type lsb galaxies and dwarfs suggest that burkert halos for these galaxies lie in a narrow strip in the ( @xmath71 ) plane : @xmath79 , which is the thick solid line in fig .",
    "4 . salucci & burkert ( 2000 ) confirmed the relation for disk galaxies up to 100 times more massive . at the highest masses in their sample",
    "there is an apparent change of slope , suggesting a cutoff in the masses of halos that harbor individual disk galaxies at @xmath80 .",
    "we overplot some of these low - redshift measurements in fig .",
    "the black circles with error bars are from the recent h@xmath81 rotation curves of late - type dwarf galaxies by marchesini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which lie near the scaling relation line . for comparison",
    ", we add the lensing cluster cl0024 + 1654 at @xmath82 .",
    "the central density and scale radius of the cluster are estimated by firmani et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . though the cluster is claimed to have soft core ( tyson , kochanski & dellantonio 1998 ; however see broadhurst et al .",
    "2000 ) , there is no evidence that the cluster has the burkert profile .",
    "the cluster is clearly well off the scaling relation defined by low - redshift disk galaxies ( which , like the cluster , are argued to be dark - matter dominated over most of their observed radii ) .",
    "it is clear that the mass profiles of strong strong lens systems ( e.g. kochanek et al .",
    "2003 ) must be cuspier than the burkert profiles on the spiral - galaxy scaling relation .",
    "if these systems have burkert profile dm halos , then the baryonic matter in these systems must be distributed in a much steeper way than the dm .",
    "it is then the baryonic matter ( not dm ) that induces strong lensing .",
    "unless the baryonic matter has very steep core profiles , the total mass profile will remain close to the burkert profile and still be highly unlikely to induce strong lensing .",
    "for example , the inclusion of exponential stellar disk effectively reduces the @xmath83 for face - on spirals :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the surface density of the stellar disk at @xmath86 . for an @xmath87 spiral with @xmath88",
    ", we obtain @xmath89 , the disk scale length @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 from the relation of salucci & borriello ( 2002 ) , who extend the scaling relation of burkert halos including the exponential stellar disk . for this system ( the rotational velocity @xmath93 at @xmath94 )",
    ", we have @xmath95 , which is significantly less than @xmath96 .",
    "however , @xmath36 is less than @xmath97 up to @xmath98 , which means that the face - on @xmath87 spiral systems ( burkert halo + exponential stellar disk ) can not produce strong lensing up to @xmath98 , unless other baryonic matter such as a bulge is included .",
    "4 also shows that the burkert halos extrapolated from the late - type galaxy scaling relation can not be used to account for lensing on cluster scales ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "one can model a lensing cluster with a burkert halo , whose @xmath100 should be beyond the demarcation line for a given @xmath17 as those of the galaxy cluster cl0024 + 1654 are .",
    "the cluster can induce strong lensing for @xmath101 , not for @xmath102 if the cluster is indeed a burkert halo .",
    "if dm halos at cluster scales do have the burkert profile , there must be be ( at least ) two different families of the burkert halos .",
    "we present an analytic lens equation for the burkert halos , and use it to characterize their lensing properties .",
    "we show that , as a result of their soft core , the burkert halos are much less likely to induce strong lensing than the nfw halos .",
    "while the qualitative result is fairly obvious , when calculated in detail , the differences in the strong - lensing predictions for the two profiles turn out to be quite dramatic .",
    "if galaxies are indeed harbored by the burkert halos , it implies that the baryonic matter ( not dm ) is responsible for strong lensing and that it is distributed in a much steeper way than the burkert profile in strong lensing systems . for strong lensing systems ( mostly elliptical galaxies ) , the total mass profiles for these systems",
    "have steeper inner slopes than the burkert profile ( koopmans & treu 2003 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this is due to a distribution of baryons or cuspiness in the dm profile for these systems .    on a galaxy scale ,",
    "lens modeling combining stellar and dm components has been carried out for the nfw profile ( e.g. keeton 2001 ) and is proving to be a useful tool to test the validity of the proposed dm profile .",
    "similar modeling with the burkert profile will test its validity . on a cluster scale",
    ", the validity of the burkert halos can be tested through galaxy kinematics ( e.g. sand , treu & ellis 2002 ) and x - ray observations ( e.g. wu & xue 2000 ) .",
    "the detailed test methods will be addressed in future articles .",
    "while challenging , it also may be feasible to constrain halo profiles by combining measurements of tangential shear and strong lensing for the same objects .",
