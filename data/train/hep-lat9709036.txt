    "in this talk we shall describe results for nucleon matrix elements : @xmath5 ( at @xmath6 ) using @xmath0 symanzik improved fermions for    * the vector current , @xmath7 ( as a warm - up exercise ) * the axial current , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quark @xmath10 * @xmath11 , the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by quark @xmath10    we have worked in the quenched approximation and generated @xmath12 configurations at @xmath13 on a @xmath14 lattice and @xmath15 configurations at @xmath16 on a @xmath17 lattice . in both cases we have used three @xmath18 values to enable us to extrapolate to the chiral limit . for the hadron spectrum see @xcite . the method to determine the matrix elements is standard , see eg @xcite ; we only note that we are computing just the quark line connected term .",
    "symanzik improvement is a systematic improvement of the action and operators to @xmath19 ( here @xmath3 ) by adding a basis of irrelevant operators to completely remove @xmath20 effects . restricting improvement to on - shell matrix elements",
    "means that the equations of motion ( @xmath21 ) can be used to reduce the set of operators . for the action we only need one additional operator",

    "derivative operators which do not contribute to the forward matrix element have been dropped .",
    "renormalised operators are then given by @xmath27 .",
    "note that these @xmath0 operator sets with coefficients @xmath28 are over - complete  using the @xmath21 they can always be reduced by one .",
    "for the vector current we have from current conservation @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 . using the @xmath21",
    "we have a one parameter degree of freedom , which we can take to be @xmath32 . from linear fits ( in @xmath33 ) to @xmath34 , @xmath35 we can find @xmath36 from the constant terms and from the gradients @xmath37 .",

    "we see from the figure that there is very good agreement between the different determinations for @xmath39 and although for @xmath40 there is some discrepancy we note that this is not unexpected as @xmath37 has @xmath0 effects .",
    "also shown are two points ( stars ) from a method described in @xcite .",

    "this is close to the value ( @xmath45 ) given from linearly interpolating the non - perturbative ward identity results in @xcite to @xmath13 , which would indicate that @xmath0 effects between these two methods are small . in fig .",

    "there is no non - perturbative determination of the renormalisation constants yet available .",
    "first order perturbation theory gives , however , numbers rather close to @xmath47 , @xcite , and indeed using tadpole improved ( @xmath48 ) perturbation theory , we see that with one derivative operators the ( large ) tadpole terms cancel . this might indicate that perturbation theory is reasonably correct . from the definition of the improved operator",
    "we see that we have parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . to remove @xmath0 effects",

    "our results seem rather constant ( in @xmath46 ) , suggesting that even in the continuum limit the lattice value is too high .",
    "we can only speculate on the discrepancy : most likely this is due to a lattice problem  quenching , chiral extrapolation , @xmath61 not accurately enough known or perhaps there is a phenomenological problem  the fits are made from low @xmath62 so there might be higher twist contributions , @xcite .",
