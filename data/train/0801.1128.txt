    "for the past twenty years , much work has been done to understand the spin structure of the nucleons .",
    "there has been progress in determining the contribution of the lightest quarks to the spin , but there is still uncertain knowledge about the gluon contribution .",
    "transversity studies have contributed additional insight about quark dynamics , but little is known about the the orbital angular momentum of the constituents.@xcite this paper will summarize a project that provides a method of gaining insight into the nature of the orbital angular momentum of the nucleon constituents .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have significantly lowered the measurement errors of the quark longitudinal spin contribution ( @xmath2 ) to the proton .",
    "the compass collaboration analysis quotes a result @xmath3 while the hermes collaboration analysis quotes a result @xmath4 these groups and others @xcite have been working on providing a significant measure of the proton s spin weighted gluon density , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath7 is the @xmath8 evolution variable .",
    "the combination of these measurements is summarized in terms of the @xmath9 sum rule : @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the projections of the spin carried by all quarks and the gluons on the @xmath13-axis , respectively .",
    "also @xmath1 is the net @xmath13-component of the orbital angular momentum of the constituents .",
    "we do not attempt to separate the flavor components of @xmath1 within the sum rule .",
    "experimental groups at the compass , hermes and rhic collaborations are measuring both the gluon polarization and the asymmetry , @xmath14 to determine the gluon polarization @xcite .",
    "since there is no suitable theoretical model for @xmath15 , we have devised a way to model the asymmetry , @xmath16 to gain insight into the structure of @xmath15 .",
    "this , coupled with the @xmath9 sum rule can then shed light on the nature of the orbital angular momentum of the constituents , @xmath1 . to model @xmath16 , we write the polarized gluon asymmetry using the decomposition @xmath17 where @xmath18 \\label{a0def}\\ ] ] is a scale invariant calculable reference form @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 represents the difference between the calculated and gauge - invariant asymmetry .",
    "since @xmath15 is unknown , a useful form is to write equation ( [ adef ] ) as @xmath20 although the quantity @xmath21 is not a physical parameter , it allows the theoretical development of the calculable quantity , @xmath22 .",
    "once an asymmetry is generated from equations ( [ a0def ] ) and ( [ dg ] ) , the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath16 can be compared to data .",
    "thus , each ansatz for @xmath21 gives a corresponding form for @xmath15 and a parametrization for @xmath1 .",
    "these can be compared to existing data to provide a range of suitable models for these contributions .    with the definition for the asymmetry in equation ( [ a0def ] ) , the dglap equations",
    "can then be used to evaluate the evolution terms on the right side . @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{a00}\\ ] ] the polarized gluon distribution in the numerator of equation ( [ a00 ] ) is replaced by @xmath24 . for certain unpolarized distributions ,",
    "there are points at which the denominator vanishes .",
    "to avoid this , we write equation ( [ a00 ] ) as : @xmath25   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & = & a_0\\cdot{{\\partial{g}}\\over { \\partial{t } } } \\\\   & = & ( 2/\\beta_0 ) a_0 \\bigl[p_{gq}^{lo}\\otimes q+p_{gg}^{lo}\\otimes g\\bigr ] .",
    "\\nonumber \\label{adge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the nlo form is essentially the same as equation ( 9 ) with the splitting functions @xmath26 replaced with their nlo counterparts .",
    "the quark and gluon unpolarized distributions are cteq5 and the polarized quark distributions are a modified ggr set .",
    "@xcite    there are constraints on @xmath27 that must be imposed to satisfy the physical behavior of the gluon asymmetry , @xmath28 .",
    "these are :    * positivity : @xmath29 for all x , and * endpoint values : @xmath30 and @xmath31    note that the constraint of @xmath32 is built in to satisfy the assumption that the large @xmath6 parton distributions are dominated by the valence up quarks in the proton . the convolutions are dominated by the quark terms , which force the asymmetry to unity as @xmath33 . to investigate the possible asymmetry models",
    ", we use a parameterization for @xmath22 in the form @xmath34 which automatically satisfies the constraints that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "once a parametrization for @xmath21 is chosen , equation ( 9 ) is used to determine the parameters in equation ( [ a0form ] ) .",
    "the models for @xmath21 that led to asymmetries that satisfied these constraints were all in the range @xmath35 , with positive and negative values included .",
    "larger values of @xmath36 violate one or both of the constraints .",
    "a representative sample of models that satisfy the constraints are listed in table 1 .",
    "note that the integrals for @xmath15 are all positive , ranging from about 0.01 to 0.42 .",
    "the models that gave negative values for these integrals did not agree with the existing asymmetry data , reported at this workshop to be :    * @xmath37 at @xmath38 from compass , @xmath39 gev@xmath40 * @xmath41 at @xmath42 from compass , @xmath43 gev@xmath40 * @xmath44 at @xmath45 from hermes , factorization method * @xmath46 at @xmath47 from hermes , approximate method .    the models in table 1 that are within one @xmath48 of the preliminary data stated above are in the third , fourth and sixth rows , respectively .",
    "plots of the full asymmetry are shown in figure 1 .",
    "none of the models in table 1 are ruled out by the data since they fall within two @xmath48 of the data for our values of @xmath39 gev@xmath40 .",
    "all of these models except for the fourth row in table 1 ( impulses in figure 1 ) generate total asymmetries @xmath49 that are close to @xmath50 .",
    "ironically , early assumptions of the polarized gluon assumed this functional form as a naive estimate to the asymmetry .",
    "next - to - leading order corrections to these asymmetries tend to bring them less positive , but with the same general shape .",
    "a full set of viable asymmetries will be presented in an upcoming paper . @xcite    using the data on @xmath2 in section 1",
    ", the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be written as : @xmath53 the three models of the asymmetry that agree most closely with existing data give values of @xmath15 in the approximate range of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the existing data with equation [ dglz ] imply the approximate relation @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the contribution of the orbital motion of the constituents to the proton spin may be comparable to the total quark contribution",
    ". a recent lattice calculation of the contribution of the quark orbital motion to the proton spin ( @xmath56 ) is consistent with zero .",
    "@xcite thus , the gluonic orbital motion appears to provide the majority contribution to @xmath1 in the @xmath9 sum rule .",
    "it is clear that future measurements of @xmath15 and @xmath57 must be made in a wider kinematic range of @xmath6 and @xmath8 with improved precision to better specify the appropriate model of the asymmetry and to extract the @xmath6 and @xmath8 dependence of the orbital angular momentum of the constituents .    99 x. ji , aip conf . proc . * 915 * : 16 , 2007 , x. ji , phys . rev . lett . * 78 * , 610 ( 1997 ) .",
