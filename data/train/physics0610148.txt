    "the expression for the absorbed energy can be alternatively derived via the average number @xmath100 of absorbed photons calculated using the photon statistics : @xmath101",
    "the essential fact is that the field strength parameter contains the cumulative mass and the charge of the cm subsystem with different powers @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the observables in the single and in the double - electron excitation differ from each other .",
    "in particular , the energy absorption from the same laser pulse by a ( 2e)-system is twice as large as in the one electron case . in the generalized many - particle problem",
    "the parabolic potential contains an arbitrary number of electrons @xmath18 . as in the ( 2e)-case the @xmath18-electron cm subhamiltonian accounting for the em field",
    "can be separated from the field - independent relative motion of the electrons .",
    "then , all the formulae describing two - electron transitions are valid for the many - electron case up to the effective charge and mass .",
    "hence the energy absorption changes linearly with the number of electrons in the well , @xmath103 . given this property , the number of active electrons in a harmonic system may be experimentally accessible .",
    "let us now discuss the two extreme cases of complete survival and full depletion of the initial state , that is its maximum and minimum survival probability .",
    "if the survival probability at the detection time equals unity , @xmath104 , the quantum system does not absorb energy from the laser field and becomes transparent for the corresponding pulse .",
    "this is strictly realized at the zero value of the field - strength parameter @xmath105 in the exponent in ( [ pmn ] ) .",
    "hence , according ( [ sigma ] ) , the absence of the oscillator frequency in the spectrum of the vector potential , @xmath106 , precludes absorption , [ cf .",
    "( [ eabs ] ) ] .",
    "note , that this statement is correct for any field intensity and not just in a first order perturbative treatment as for nonparabolic confinements .    as an example , consider a laser field consisting of two consecutive gaussians shifted in time by the interval @xmath107 : @xmath108\\eulere^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(t+a)/t_p\\right]^2}\\!\\!+\\ , \\sin[\\omega_l(t - a)]\\eulere^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(t - a)/t_p\\right]^2}$ ] .",
    "setting e.g. , the laser frequency @xmath109 and the halfwidth of pulses @xmath110 , we aim at finding a relation between the time delay @xmath107 and the oscillator frequency @xmath3 , for which @xmath111 .",
    "the result is @xmath112 with @xmath80 an integer .",
    "this is , in fact , a condition for the destructive interference ( in time ) of the two waves within the characteristic time - domain @xmath113 of the system . in terms of the excitation picture",
    "the explanation is the following : the electronic wave packet , distributed over the excited levels by the first pulse , may be assembled back to the initial state by the second pulse , if the phase difference between the pulses is chosen properly .",
    "the opposite case amounts to the minimum survival probability , i.e.  the maximum depletion of the initial state . on account of @xmath114",
    "this is the case if the spectral power at the transition energy ( coinciding with the oscillator frequency @xmath3 ) is infinitely large .",
    "it is equivalent to the presence of an infinite , monochromatic laser pulse @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "such a pulse resonantly depletes , for instance , the ground state . for a finite pulse , e.g. , @xmath117 with a power spectrum @xmath118 ,",
    "there is always nonvanishing absorption .",
    "however , only for the resonance @xmath119 the absorption exists in the limit of large pulse durations , @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , if the initial state differs from the ground state , its full depletion occurs at such values of @xmath121 satisfying @xmath122 .",
    "for example , the well prepared state with @xmath123 will be exhausted and distributed over other levels by the laser field of the strength @xmath124 [ cf .",

    "in this paper we considered the exactly solvable problem of the excitation of two interacting electrons , confined in a parabolic well in the presence of a laser field .",
    "the expression for the time - dependent population of the excited two - electron states was derived .",
    "the physical features of the process , such as the poisson statistics of the transition probabilities and the linear dependence of the energy absorption on the laser power , were analyzed , in particular , the conditions for the complete survival and full depletion of the initial state . our approach can be used for the testing of approximate theories dealing with few - body multiphoton excitations .",
