    "the physical interpretation of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) remains a fervently debated and unsolved problem ( for recent reviews , see king 2006 ; fabbiano & white 2006 ; colbert & miller 2004 ) .",
    "they could be scaled - up equivalents of galactic black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries , with a higher - mass accretor ( up to @xmath11 a few @xmath12 for the brightest sources , if the accretion is isotropic and eddington - limited ) .",
    "alternatively , they could be beamed sources  either mild geometrical beaming or relativistic doppler boosting have been suggested ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; krding , falcke & markoff  2002 ; fabrika & mescheryakov 2001 ) .",
    "a direct comparison with galactic bh x - ray binaries is hampered by at least two problems .",
    "firstly , the mass and evolutionary state of the donor star is unknown in almost all cases : some ulxs appear to be associated with ob associations or young star clusters ; others , however , do not have optical counterparts down to typical detection limits @xmath13 mag .",
    "secondly , most ulxs have been observed in the x - rays only once or few times over the last decade ; thus , it is still unclear whether they follow the same patterns of spectral evolution and state transitions as daily - monitored galactic bh x - ray binaries , and over what time - scale .    in this paper , we report the serendipitous discovery of two ulxs in the face - on sabcd galaxy ngc7424 .",
    "henceforth , we adopt a distance @xmath14 mpc ( tully 1988 ) ; a slightly lower distance of @xmath15 mpc was estimated by bker et al .",
    "the galaxy was observed twice with _",
    "chandra _ , on 2002 may 2122 and 2002 june 11 , to study the x - ray supernova sn2001ig ( evans , white & bembrick 2001 ; schlegel & ryder 2002 ) . for the same reason",
    ", it was monitored on a regular basis for three years with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) ( ryder et al .",
    "we studied the x - ray spectral state of the two ulxs found near sn2001ig , and their variability between the two observations .",
    "we then searched for their radio and optical counterparts , using the atca dataset , together with archival _ hst_/wfpc2 and new _ gemini _ images ( ryder , murrowood & stathakis  2006 ) .",
    "finally , we determined the x - ray luminosity and colours of the other bright x - ray sources detected in the field of this galaxy .",
    "we analysed the two _ chandra _ datasets ( table 1 ) with standard tasks from the ciao-3.3 data - reduction package . specifically , we checked for aspect offsets in the level-1 event files , and applied the appropriate astrometric corrections .",
    "we created new bad - pixel files with the acis_run_hotpix script , which flags hot pixels and cosmic - ray afterglows .",
    "we then created new level-2 event files with acis_process_events , which provides the newest gain maps , time - dependent gain corrections , charge - transfer - inefficiency corrections , pixel and pha randomization .",
    "we then filtered the event files for bad grades and applied the good - time - intervals .",
    "we checked that there were no significant background flares in either observations .",
    "we used wavdetect to identify discrete sources in both datasets , and in different energy bands .",
    "we also used a combined image ( obtained with merge_all ) to detect fainter sources .",
    "lightcurves of the brightest sources were obtained with dmextract .",
    "spectra and corresponding response files were extracted with specextract , and modelled with xspec version 11.3.1 ( arnaud  1996 ) .",
    ".details of the _ chandra _ observations of ngc7424 used for our study . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     taken together , the 2.4 and 4.8ghz atca observations of ulx2 provide conclusive evidence of a radio counterpart , physically associated with the x - ray source , the young stellar complex , or both .",
    "there are very few confirmed detections of individual radio sources associated with ulxs .",
    "the full list to - date consists of : one source in ngc5408 ( kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ; soria et al .",
    "2006 ) ; one in holmberg  ii ( tongue & westpfahl 1995 ; miller , mushotzky & neff 2005 ) ; one in ngc6946 ( roberts & colbert 2006 ; swartz et al .",
    "2006 in preparation ) ; and probably two in m82 ( kronberg & sramek 1985 ; krding et al .",
    "2005 ) , where , however , confusion is a problem and chance coincidences are more likely . in ngc7424 , the centroid of the radio emission , both at 2.4 and 4.8 ghz ,",
    "is clearly offset from the x - ray position of ulx 2 by @xmath16 , to the south ( figure  10 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath7 pc at the assumed distance .",
    "the offsets can not be attributed to a systematic astrometric error as the radio coordinates of the peak emission from sn2001ig and the nearby background source lie within their respective _",
    "chandra _ error circles . on the other hand , considering that there are no other radio or x - ray sources within 3 kpc , the possibility of a chance coincidence at least with the stellar complex , if not directly with the ulx , is unlikely .",
    "there are a few possible interpretations of the candidate radio counterpart to ulx2 .",
    "one possibility is that the emission is doppler - boosted synchrotron radiation from a jet .",
    "the one - sidedness of the radio offset from the _ chandra _ position is then naturally explained by de - boosting of the opposite jet , as is often the case in radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "a radio offset of @xmath7 pc is not substantially larger than the size of the jet in , for example , the galactic microquasar ss433 ( downes , pauls & salter 1986 ; dubner et al .",
    "however , a flat radio spectrum is expected from a steady jet in a beamed source ( core emission ) , whereas our 2.4 and 4.8ghz measured fluxes ( table  [ t : radio ] ) imply @xmath8 , which is more consistent with a radio lobe signature .",
    "we can also rule out ( see also freeland et al .",
    "2006 ) the possibility that radio and x - ray emission are produced by the same synchrotron component .",
    "optically - thin , doppler - boosted radio emission may however be produced by sporadic ejections ( eg . , fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "monitoring of the position and flux of the radio source in the next few years would test this scenario .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the emission arises in a radio lobe , produced by long - term jet activity from ulx2 .",
    "it has been suggested ( heinz 2002 ; hardcastle & worrall 2000 ; hardcastle 2005 ) that the radio lobes of microquasars may be considerably less prominent and more short - lived than those of frii radio galaxies because of lower effective densities in the surrounding interstellar medium , relative to the intergalactic medium : the under - dense environment favours adiabatic losses over synchrotron losses .",
    "moreover , the counterpart to ulx2 appears to be a single radio structure , whereas frii radio galaxies tend to exhibit double radio lobes .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that we see only a single radio lobe associated with ulx2 because only one side of its jet has impacted onto a molecular cloud or an over - density in the local interstellar medium , allowing the lobe to form .",
    "a third possibility is that the radio emission is optically - thin synchrotron radiation produced by a young snr , perhaps from the progenitor of the bh in ulx2 itself .",
    "we already noted from the _ gemini _ data ( section 4 ) that ulx2 lies in a region characterized by young star clusters , with characteristic ages @xmath3@xmath4 myr .",
    "in fact , the position of the most massive cluster is still marginally consistent with the radio source . from its",
    "estimated mass and age ( section 4 ) , we estimate a current rate of 1 sn every @xmath17@xmath18 kyr in that cluster alone , and 1 every @xmath19@xmath20 kyr in the whole complex .",
    "hence , the odds of finding a young snr ( age @xmath21 yr ) in that region are not negligible . as a comparison ,",
    "the source is @xmath22 times as luminous as the prototypical core - collapse young snr , cas a , with a similar spectral index ( reynoso & goss 2002 ) .",
    "if the snr is associated with the ulx , the radio / x - ray offset can be explained by an initial kick velocity : a recoil speed of @xmath23 would be sufficient to explain an @xmath24pc offset after @xmath25 yr .",
    "we can estimate an upper limit on the energy content of an expanding synchrotron bubble ( snr or lobe ) using the minimum - energy argument ( e.g. , pacholczyk 1970 ; bicknell 2005 ) .",
    "since the source in ngc7424 is unresolved , its linear size must be @xmath26 . assuming a ratio of relativistic proton to electron energies @xmath27 , and a range of electron lorentz factors @xmath28 , we obtain a total energy @xmath29 erg ( see also a more extended discussion of this argument in soria et al .",
    "this exceeds the typical energies inferred for normal supernovae : perhaps not surprisingly , since we already know that its radio luminosity would put it at the upper end of all known snrs .",
    "however , the energy estimate is only an upper limit and is most sensitive to the source size @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "if one could firmly establish that the energy is too high to have been imparted by a supernova , then the jet scenario would become more likely .",
    "but one could equally well invoke a class of more energetic hypernovae , with a higher core mass , as the progenitors of ulxs .",
    "higher spatial resolution maps with the vla ( in a or b configuration ) could provide stronger observational constraints on the snr versus lobe interpretation of the radio emission .",
    "a similar ambiguity between the snr and radio lobe scenarios was also discussed for the ulx / radio associations in holmberg ii ( where the lobe interpretation is deemed much more likely : miller et al .",
    "2005 ) and ngc5408 ( where the lobe scenario was considered slightly more likely : soria et al .",
    "both radio counterparts are @xmath32 times less luminous than the source near ulx2 in ngc7424 .",
    "the radio source near the ulx in ngc6946 was initially classified as an snr ( mf16 : van dyk et al .",
    "1994 ; blair , fesen & schlegel 2001 ) but is now also being re - evaluated as a possible radio - lobe structure , based on its associated optical morphology ( swartz et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) ; its radio luminosity and spectral index are almost exactly the same as the source in ngc7424 . for m82 ( krding et al .",
    "2005 ) , both ulx - d and ulx - f have persistent , compact radio sources slightly displaced ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively ) from the _ chandra _ positions ; both radio sources have a luminosity a factor of @xmath35 higher than the radio source near ulx2 in ngc7424 .",
    "they have been classified as snrs by analogy with other compact sources in m82 , but there are no elements to rule out a lobe origin .",
    "there was also a transient source near ulx - d ( @xmath36 displacement ) , reaching a luminosity @xmath37 times higher than the ngc7424 source , in 1981 , but declining and turning off after a few months ; it can be interpreted either as a beamed flare from the ulx itself , or as a new supernova missed in the optical band because of extinction .",
    "perhaps the most striking similarity of all detections of candidate ulx radio counterparts is the association in all cases with young or actively star - forming regions .",
    "this suggests that the exceptionally strong radio emission is not intrinsic to the ulxs or due to chance geometrical factors ( doppler - boosted ejections ) but is more likely to have been enhanced by the dense environment ( radio lobe scenario ) or to be due to young snrs .",
    "so far , there have been no core radio detections of ulx counterparts .",
    "hence , it is also evident that we can not directly compare x - ray and radio luminosities via fundamental - plane relations ( e.g. , merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ) ; we may instead compare , in principle , the ulx ( instantaneous ) x - ray luminosities with the ( integrated ) mechanical power injected into the radio lobes . if some or most ulx radio counterparts are synchrotron lobes , we would expect to find similar structures around other ulxs currently in quiescence ; the relative abundance of such sources would constrain the average ulx duty cycle .",
    "it would be even more difficult to recognize and distinguish those radio sources from bright snrs , when they are not associated with a bright , accreting x - ray source .",
    "if we only had the first of our two _ chandra _ observations , ulx2 itself may have gone unnoticed and its radio counterpart would have been classified as an snr without further questioning .      finally , we found another exceptionally bright , unresolved radio source located @xmath38 south - west of the nucleus , coincident with another bright knot of young stars and clusters inside the southern spiral arm ( figures 1 , 11 ) ; in the optical bands , this young complex is @xmath39 mag brighter than the stellar complex associated with ulx2 .",
    "a study of that region is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we simply point out that there is no x - ray emission @xmath40 erg s@xmath1 from that complex .",
    "instead , the radio source ( j2000 coordinates : r.a .",
    "@xmath41 ; dec .",
    "@xmath42 ) , labelled `` source b '' in table 7 , is even brighter than the one near ulx2 .",
    "it has a rather flat spectral index ( @xmath43 between @xmath44 and @xmath6 ghz . )",
    "such indices are generally found in plerions , also known as pulsar - wind - nebulae ( weiler & panagia 1978 ; gaensler & slane 2006 ) ; the crab nebula is the best - studied example . the radio emission in this class of snrs is mostly powered by spin - down luminosity of the central compact object ( a pulsar in all known cases ) , via a magnetized wind which may also interact with the expanding snr shell .",
    "the radio luminosity of source b in ngc7424 is @xmath45 times the crab luminosity ; among the highest known , although similar or even higher luminosities were found in a few recent sne such as sn1979c and sn1986j ( bartel & bietenholz 2005 ) .",
    "if source b is indeed a pulsar wind nebula , a radio luminosity @xmath46 erg s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 at @xmath6 ghz suggests an age @xmath47 a few @xmath18 yr ( e.g. , bandiera , pacini & salvati 1984 ; frail & scharringhausen 1997 ) ; its x - ray luminosity may be @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 ( e.g. , becker & trmper 1997 ) , just below our detection limit .",
    "we studied the brightest x - ray sources and their optical and radio counterparts and environments in the face - on spiral galaxy ngc7424 .",
    "the galaxy was originally monitored in various energy bands to study the evolution of sn2001ig .",
    "in particular , we studied it with _ gemini _ in the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 optical bands , in 2004 ; with the atca in four radio bands , over many observations between 2001 and 2004 ; and with _ chandra _",
    ", twice , on 2002 may 2122 and june 11 .",
    "optical and radio results on sn2001ig are reported elsewhere ( ryder et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) ; here we only revise its x - ray colours and luminosity , @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 on 2002 may 2122 , declining to @xmath53 erg s@xmath1 on 2002 june 11 , for a @xmath54 kev thermal plasma .",
    "our monitoring of ngc7424 has led us to the serendipitous discovery of two ulxs with interesting multi - band properties .",
    "ulx1 shows a @xmath55 increase in flux between the two observations , reaching an emitted luminosity @xmath56 erg s@xmath1 in the second one .",
    "it may have been even brighter when observed by _ rosat _ , in 1990 .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is well fitted with a power - law of photon index @xmath57 .",
    "this is significantly flatter ( harder ) than the typical values found in galactic bhs when they are bright ( @xmath58 ) _ and _ power - law dominated .",
    "various other bright ulxs have shown this feature , which is yet to be properly understood : we have briefly discussed some possible explanations .",
    "ulx1 is in a relatively empty interarm region , far from any bright clusters or star - forming complexes ; the brightest optical source in the _ chandra _ error box has an absolute magnitude @xmath59 mag , consistent with a main - sequence b star .",
    "ulx2 is more peculiar for at least three reasons .",
    "firstly , it showed some kind of outburst or state transition between the two _ chandra _ observations , increasing its brightness by an order of magnitude .",
    "thermal plasma emission is also detected in its high state .",
    "secondly , unlike ulx1 , it is located in an exceptionally bright , young stellar complex ( age @xmath3@xmath4 myr depending on the assumed metal abundance ) , which also includes a few compact clusters .",
    "it is still unclear why some ulxs are in low - density , probably older environments while others are associated with ob associations and young star clusters .",
    "a similar dichotomy is sometimes found within the same galaxy .",
    "for example , the late - type spiral galaxy ngc4559 also contains two bright ulxs ( cropper et al .",
    "2004 ) , one of them located in an interarm region relatively devoid of bright stars , the other in a bright star - forming complex a few hundred pc in size ( soria et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in the case of ulx2 in ngc7424 , the biggest star cluster in its environment has a mass @xmath11 a few @xmath60 . in general ,",
    "ulxs seem to be associated with young medium - size clusters much more often than with super star - clusters ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this may give us a clue to the most likely formation process for the accreting bhs .",
    "in fact , the observed x - ray luminosities only require bh masses up to @xmath62 . the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition to end up with such",
    "a bh is to have a massive stellar progenitor , perhaps up to @xmath63 , preferebly with low metal abundance .",
    "we speculate that the most efficient process to create such a massive progenitor could be an externally - triggered , dynamical gas collapse in a medium - size protocluster , together with a few class-0 protostellar mergers , rather than runaway mergers of main - sequence o stars in a super star - cluster .    the third reason why ulx2 is remarkable is the presence of an exceptionally bright ( twice as luminous as cas a ) , unresolved radio source slightly offset from the ulx ( @xmath7 pc ) .",
    "its radio spectral index ( @xmath8 ) is consistent with optically - thin synchrotron emission .",
    "two alternative interpretations for the radio source are either lobe emission , powered by a ulx jet , or a young , bright snr ( or perhaps hypernova remnant ) associated with the young stellar complex or maybe even the progenitor of the ulx itself .",
    "compact radio sources of similar brightness and spectral index have been found associated with a handful of other ulxs , in some cases implying energies up to @xmath64 erg . in almost all cases , it is impossible to rule out either of those two scenarios altogether",
    ". it may even be possible that jet lobes and an underlying snr coexist , like in the galactic microquasar ss433 .",
    "another bright ( in fact , even brighter ) , unresolved radio source was found in the southern spiral arm , also associated with a young , massive stellar complex . in that case , however , there are no x - ray sources nearby",
    ". moreover , its radio spectral index is flatter ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we speculate that it is most likely to be a very young pulsar - wind nebula , @xmath45 times more luminous than the crab nebula .",
    "however , further radio and x - ray observations of this peculiar source will be necessary to test this hypothesis and rule out other scenarios , for example beamed radio core emission from a microblazar .",
    "this year , _ chandra _ is carrying out a complete snapshot survey of ulxs in about 150 galaxies within 15 mpc , to pinpoint their locations ( pi : d. swartz ) .",
    "a systematic optical survey of the same galaxies is also being carried out or planned , to classify and study the ulx optical counterparts .",
    "however , much more work remains to be done to plan and implement a correspondingly deep , complete radio survey , which would determine what fraction of ulxs are associated with optically - thin synchrotron sources , whether those sources are statistically different from normal snrs , and perhaps also help distinguishing between snr and radio lobe scenarios .",
    "the long - term goal of combined radio / x - ray studies is to determine the balance of power in accreting bhs , between radiative ( x - rays ) and mechanical luminosity ( jet power ) in different spectral states .",

    "<S> we have studied the face - on , barred spiral ngc7424 ( site of the rare type iib sn2001ig ) with _ chandra _ , _ gemini _ and the australia telescope compact array . after giving revised x - ray colours and luminosity of the supernova , here we focus on some other interesting sources in the galaxy : in particular , our serendipitous discovery of two ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the brighter one ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ) has a power - law - like spectrum with photon index @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the other ulx shows a spectral state transition or outburst between the two _ chandra _ observations , 20 days apart . </S>",
    "<S> optical data show that this ulx is located in a young ( age @xmath3@xmath4 myr ) , bright complex rich with ob stars and clusters . </S>",
    "<S> an exceptionally bright , unresolved radio source ( @xmath5 mjy at @xmath6 ghz , implying a radio luminosity twice as high as cas a ) is found slightly offset from the ulx ( @xmath7 pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> its radio spectral index @xmath8 suggests optically - thin synchrotron emission , either from a young supernova remnant or from a radio lobe powered by a ulx jet . </S>",
    "<S> an even brighter , unresolved radio source ( @xmath9 mjy at @xmath6 ghz ) is found in another young , massive stellar complex , not associated with any x - ray sources : based on its flatter radio spectral index ( @xmath10 ) , we suggest that it is a young pulsar wind nebula , a factor of @xmath4 more radio luminous than the crab .    </S>",
