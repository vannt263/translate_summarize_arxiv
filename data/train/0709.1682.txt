    "filtering , which in a broad sense is a method for extracting information from a noisy signal , is one of the principal tools in modern engineering science . in particular , when considering a partially observed dynamical system , we can construct an optimal filter that computes the least square estimate of a state variable of the dynamics . in the linear case , this results in the so - called _ kalman filter _ @xcite .",
    "this dynamical filtering theory was rigorously established using the classical kolmogorov probability theory and its application to the theory of stochastic differential equations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is well known as the _ separation theorem _ @xcite that the solution of a general optimal control problem for a partially observed system can be represented in terms of a corresponding information state of the filter . for this reason ,",
    "the filtering theory is not only important in itself , but also essential in feedback control theory .",
    "the situation is much the same in quantum mechanics .",
    "the _ heisenberg uncertainty principle _ shows that any quantum system must possess fundamental uncertainty originating from the noncommutativity of its random variables .",
    "therefore , we can never have complete observation in the quantum setting , which implies the necessity of filtering in the quantum case .",
    "fortunately , there exists a _",
    "quantum filtering theory _ as a beautiful parallel to the classical one .",
    "the theory was pioneered by belavkin in the remarkable papers @xcite , and the _ quantum filtering equation _ or _",
    "stochastic master equation _ is now widely used in the physics community @xcite . moreover , as in the classical theory , it is possible to show that a separation principle holds in the quantum case @xcite .",
    "the filtering for both classical and quantum cases is , as mentioned above , clearly an important tool in control theory .",
    "however , we have to point out that the optimal filter is in general quite fragile to unmodeled uncertainty of the system , and consequently the optimal estimation can be largely violated .",
    "this fact requires us to develop a theory of _ robust estimation _ that allows some model uncertainties and guarantees high - quality estimation performance . _",
    "guaranteed - cost filtering _",
    "@xcite is one such robust estimation method in the classical theory .",
    "it guarantees that the variance of the estimation error is within a certain bound even when the linear system under consideration includes unknown parameters .",
    "moreover , _ risk - sensitive filtering _",
    "@xcite is known as a very efficient robust estimation method , for a wide class of classical linear and nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "recently , one of the authors has obtained a quantum version of the guaranteed - cost filter mentioned above @xcite . in this paper , we develop a quantum risk - sensitive estimation theory .",
    "let us first briefly introduce the classical theory of risk - sensitive estimation .",
    "we are given a probability space @xmath0 and a signal model of a discrete time system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the signal state , @xmath3 is the output , and @xmath4 are _ i.i.d .",

    "a version of the risk - sensitive estimator of @xmath2 is defined as @xmath5,\\qquad      \\psi(z_l)={\\rm exp}\\big[\\mu_1\\sum_{i=1}^{l-1}(x_i-\\hat{x}_i^\\mu)^2                             + \\mu_2(x_l - z_l)^2 \\big],\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-algebra generated from the observation @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the weighting constants called the _ risk - sensitive parameters_. moreover , we use the notation @xmath10 to indicate that @xmath11 is a bounded @xmath12-measurable function .",
    "the risk - sensitive estimator ( [ classical - rs - estimator ] ) can be represented by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a certain function and @xmath15 is an _ information state _ defined by @xmath16      = \\int_{{\\mathbb r}}\\zeta(x)\\alpha_l^\\mu(x)dx,\\ ] ] for all test functions @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is a probability measure defined by @xmath19.\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath15 satisfies a recursive equation of the form @xmath20 .",
    "hence , running this equation with the measurement data @xmath3 , we can recursively calculate @xmath21 and obtain the minimizer of this function , i.e. , @xmath22 .    note",
    "that @xmath22 differs from the standard optimal ( or _ risk - neutral _ ) estimator @xmath23 @xmath24 $ ] and is thus not optimal in the sense of the mean square error .",
    "however , the risk - sensitive estimator certainly has a great advantage over the risk - neutral one when we consider an uncertain system .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "if the true probability measure @xmath25 is unknown , then we need to use a known nominal measure @xmath26 and design a nominal filter based on @xmath26 . however , since @xmath27 , there is no guarantee that the nominal estimator @xmath28 yields a bounded estimation error .",
    "the risk - sensitive estimator overcomes this issue .",
    "that is , the nominal risk - sensitive estimator @xmath29 ( i.e. , based on @xmath26 ) satisfies @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{3em }      \\leq       \\log{\\bf e}_{{\\bf p}_{{\\rm nom } } }                             [ \\psi(\\hat{x}_l^{\\mu,{\\rm nom } } ) ]         + r^c({\\bf p}_{{\\rm true}}\\|{\\bf p}_{{\\rm nom } } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the classical relative entropy of @xmath18 and @xmath32 .",

    "this paper provides a quantum version of the risk - sensitive estimation method presented above and shows its robustness properties against system uncertainty .",
    "the systems we consider are taken from quantum optics and consist of a quantum system in interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "the field is described by a discretized model @xcite that converges to a quantum stochastic dynamics @xcite when the discretization step is taken to zero @xcite .",
    "the discretized model has the advantage of being very tractable mathematically .",
    "the estimator is based on the risk - sensitive information state introduced by james @xcite in the context of quantum risk - sensitive control .",
