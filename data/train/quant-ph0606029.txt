    "the paradigm  to generate maximal entanglement and to perform perfect qubit - state transmission over arbitrary distance is the protocols using the pre - engineered inhomogeneous nn couplings @xcite . among them , the practical scheme realizes the transmission of gaussian wave packet as flying qubit via the spin system with uniform nn couplings @xcite .",
    "the advantages of such scheme rest with its fast transfer , which means that the period of transfer time is proportional to the distance , and the higher fidelity for longer distance .",
    "we also notice that there is a current interest in studying systems with long - range inter - qubit interactions @xcite .    in this paper",

    "quantum state transfer may require the long - range interactions beyond nn interactions , but they should be required to decay rapidly in order to avoid the direct connecting coupling between two distant qubits that trivially causes quantum entanglement .",
    "now we propose a novel protocol based on a pre - engineered @xmath0-model with long - range @xmath1-decay interactions .",
    "it is found that such model has the same function as that of the modulated nn coupling spin model @xcite , offering significant advantages over other protocols in the tasks perfectly transferring quantum state and generating entanglement between two sites over longer distance .",

    "iv we perform numerical calculation to confirm some of the obtained analytical results and the validity of the truncation approximation .     of a system which is shown to be a perfect entangler .",

    "usually , we regard a @xmath9 spin as a qubit , and a coupled spin system as a qubit array respectively . the simple coupled qubit array is usually described by the spin-@xmath9 @xmath0 model .",

    ", the dynamics can be reduced to that in some invariant subspaces .",
    "thus we can only concentrate on the single excitation subspace hereafter .",
    "if a single - site flipped state can be correctly transferred , a qubit state should also be transferred correspondingly because the saturate ferromagnetic state with all spins up state @xmath20 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",

    "we first show that such kind of systems can perform perfect state transfer and long range entanglement generation , and then we can provide a practical example that satisfies this linear dispersion relation .      in order to investigate the dynamics of  generating entanglement in the spin system with linear dispersion relation mentioned above , we concentrate on the case where the initial state is single - site flipped state@xmath40 , @xmath24 $ ] .",
