    "the study of properties of the most exotic isotopes continues to be one of the important tasks in experimental nuclear physics .",
    "in addition , masses , lifetimes , and properties of excited states are important not only for models of nuclear structure but also for the understanding of astrophysical processes .",
    "the first step in the study of a new exotic nucleus is its observation , which for neutron - rich nuclei demonstrates its stability with respect to particle emission .",
    "the neutron dripline is only confirmed up to @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) by work at projectile fragmentation facilities in the us @xcite , france @xcite , and japan @xcite . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ chart ] , the dripline rapidly shifts to higher neutron numbers at @xmath4 and @xmath5 has been observed by several groups @xcite .",
    "this shift makes the search for the neutron dripline in this region especially difficult but none the less important .",
    "experiments at riken in japan @xcite and at ganil in france @xcite observed the two heaviest isotopes along the @xmath6 line , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , by the fragmentation of @xmath9 projectiles . the heavier nuclei in this series , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are unobserved at present .",
    "all nuclei with @xmath12 up to @xmath13 have been shown to be unbound .",
    "the neighboring nuclei with @xmath14 have been observed up to @xmath15 but the production of the heavier nuclei from a @xmath0 beam requires a reaction with a net neutron pick - up .    in the present work a series of measurements",
    "was carried out to search for new neutron - rich isotopes in this region and to measure the cross sections for production of these isotopes . a particular candidate for study",
    "is @xmath16 , a nuclide that has two more neutrons than the projectile nucleus .",
    "nucleon pick - up products have been observed among fragmentation products , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , but their cross sections are significantly lower than those of pure fragmentation processes .",
    "the new data for the production cross sections builds upon the recent results from mocko et al .",
    "@xcite and can provide a path to the production of the most neutron - rich nuclei .    ,",
    "a 142  mev / u @xmath0 beam from the coupled cyclotron facility at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory was used to irradiate either a @xmath17 target ( 724  mg/@xmath18 ) or a @xmath19 target ( 1111  mg/@xmath18 ) located at the normal target position of the a1900 fragment separator @xcite .",
    "the tungsten target was used due to its high melting point even though it is not monoisotopic .",
    "the average primary beam intensity for the measurements of the most exotic fragments was 70  pna .",
    "the momentum acceptance of the separator was either @xmath20 or @xmath21 and the angular acceptance was 8  msr .",
    "the experimental setup and analysis procedures used for this experiment were similar to those described in refs .",
    "@xcite and only the differences will be briefly described .",
    "the time of flight of each particle that reached the focal plane was measured in two ways : first , over the 17.8  m flight path between a plastic scintillator ( 22  mg/@xmath22 thick ) located at the second dispersive image ( image 2 ) and a 10  cm thick plastic backstop scintillator located at the focal plane of the separator , and also over the entire 35.6  m flight path of the a1900 fragment separator by measuring the arrival time relative to the phase of the cyclotron rf - signal . the magnetic rigidity for each particle",
    "was determined by the separator setting plus a correction based on the position measurements at image 2 with the plastic scintillator , and at the focal plane of the separator using a set of parallel - plate avalanche counters ( ppacs ) .",
    "the standard focal plane detector setup was augmented to have three silicon pin diodes ( @xmath23  mm@xmath24 by 496  @xmath25 m , 528  @xmath25 m , and 526  @xmath25 m thick ) to enable multiple measurements of the energy - loss of the fragments and thus provide redundant determinations of the nuclear charge of each fragment .",
    "the simultaneous measurements of multiple @xmath26 signals , the magnetic rigidity , a scintillator signal proportional to the total energy , as well as the flight times for each particle provided an unambiguous identification of the atomic number , charge state , and mass of the produced fragments .",
    "the position and angle measurements with ppacs at the focal plane also enabled discrimination against various scattered particles .",
    "the relative beam current was monitored continuously by a small baf@xmath27 crystal mounted on a photomultiplier tube near the target position that provided a normalization for the data obtained at different magnetic rigidities . in order to map out the momentum distributions of the fragmentation products and provide the production yields ,",
    "the magnetic rigidity of the separator was varied stepwise from 4.13  tm to 4.89  tm .",
    "the momentum distributions of isotopes between magnesium and phosphorus that were present at these settings were analyzed during the experiment .",
    "these measured distributions are in good agreement with lise++ @xcite calculations , using either the universial parameterization @xcite or the model by morrissey @xcite , so that the optimum separator setting for the heaviest isotopes ( that were produced at a higher rigidity setting with very low rates ) could be inferred from our lise++ calculations . once the optimum setting was determined , an achromatic energy - loss degrader ( @xmath28 , 151  mg/@xmath18 ) was inserted at image 2 of the a1900 separator in addition to the plastic scintillator to cut down the range of atomic numbers of the fragments reaching the focal plane .     versus mass - to - charge ratio @xmath29 for @xmath30 to 15.,width=328 ]",
    "a search for @xmath1 was carried out by performing several runs totaling 4.3 hours with the tungsten target and 5.8 hours with the beryllium target at a setting optimized for @xmath31 and @xmath32 at a rigidity of 5.045  tm ( 4.9598  tm after image 2 ) .",
    "the combination of the higher energy loss of silicon isotopes in the thick targets and the image 2 degrader plus the expected momentum downshift due to nucleon pickup ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) placed @xmath1 in the acceptance of the fragment separator .",
    "three events identified as @xmath1 nuclei were observed during the measurements with the tungsten target ( see fig .  [ pid ] ) and none were observed with the beryllium target .",
    "the overall efficiency of the system was found to be @xmath33% and @xmath34% when running with the tungsten and beryllium targets , respectively .",
    "the efficiency was dominated by the deadtime of the data acquisition system and the discrimination against pileup events in the focal plane detector .",
    "trigger rates averaged 200  hz for the runs with the tungsten target , and 450  hz with the berryllium target .",
    "the simulated angular transmission ranged from 77% for @xmath31 to 84% for @xmath1 with an estimated uncertainty of 5% using the technique described by mocko et al .",
    "the cross sections for the production of neutron - rich silicon isotopes from this work are shown in fig .",
    "[ z14_cs ] and given in table  [ tab_cs ] along with the cross sections recently reported by mocko et al .",
    "@xcite for the reaction of @xmath0 with @xmath17 and @xmath35 at the same bombarding energy . for the purpose of comparison",
    "we will consider the tantalum and tungsten targets as equivalent .",
    "the cross sections for reaction with the tungsten target are larger than those with beryllium by factors that range from approximately 2.5 at @xmath36 to about 9 at @xmath37 , values that become significantly larger than the ratio of the geometric reaction cross sections @xmath38 @xmath39",
    "the data show a smooth decline with increasing mass number ( or neutron number ) up to @xmath37 , and then a precipitous drop by about a factor of 110 for the two silicon isotopes with more neutrons than the projectile .",
    "the slope of the data compares well to the epax  2.15 systematics @xcite although the data sets lie below the predictions .",
    "the epax parameterization describes the products of _ limiting fragmentation _ that occurs at high bombarding energies and only depends on the sizes of the target and projectile .",
    "closer comparison of the prediction to the data shows that the cross sections for @xmath40 from both targets are more suppressed than the average of the lighter isotopes .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the most neutron - rich nuclei come from the decay of excited primary fragments that are themselves even more neutron - rich ( and suppressed by the process of significant neutron transfer from the target at these bombarding energies due to momentum mismatch ) .",
    ".cross sections for neutron - rich mg and si isotopes observed in this work.[tab_cs ] [ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < \" , ]      ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) are compared to the epax systematics for limiting fragmentation .",
    "[ z14_cs],width=328 ]    models of nuclear reactions used for counting rate estimates , like the intranuclear - cascade plus evaporation model @xcite or abrasion - ablation in lise++ @xcite can not reproduce the low yields of the exotic nuclei observed in this study . thus it is not possible to make reliable predictions for further work . as a starting point ,",
    "the cross sections in peripheral two - body reactions have been analyzed in the framework of the @xmath42 systematics for a long time @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the @xmath42 systematics is that the products are created in a statistical , thermal process and the cross section should follow the expression @xmath43 where @xmath42 is the simple difference between the mass excesses of the ground states of the product and reactant nuclei and @xmath44 is an effective temperature that is fitted to the data .",
    "such an ansatz is reasonable at low energies when the nuclei undergo a slow transfer process and for the observation of projectile residues from mass - asymmetric reactions where the bulk of the excitation energy is carried by the heavy partner . over the years",
    "a number of measurements of light products at higher energies have found some agreement with this model as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ qg_gg ] ( left panels ) for the data from this study combined with the data from mocko et al.@xcite .",
    "the data for the most neutron - rich isotopes in each chain tend toward straight lines but the bulk of the data with the highest yields , highest precision , and lowest @xmath45-values behaves very differently .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath42 is most sensitive to the mass of the lighter fragment since the binding energy changes most rapidly with neutron and proton number in the low mass region .",
    "previous studies that were used to develop the @xmath42 systematics relied on the analysis of the distributions of the light fragment from reactions in normal kinematics @xcite . in the present work the lighter fragment is the _ target residue _ in the case of the beryllium target , whereas it is the _ projectile residue _ in the case of the tungsten target .",
    "the dominant factor in the exponential is then either the unobserved fragment ( beryllium target , panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ qg_gg ] ) or the observed fragment ( heavy target , panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ qg_gg ] ) .",
    "projectile fragmentation is usually not described as a two - body process , but rather as a sudden process that forms an excited prefragment followed by statistical decay .",
    "charity @xcite has pointed out that the sequential evaporation of light particles from sufficiently excited nuclei follows a general pattern that leads to a somewhat uniform distribution of final products .",
    "this uniform distribution underlies the epax systematics . in the usual case neutrons",
    "are emitted preferentially from excited nuclei until the point at which the ratio of the widths for statistical emission of neutrons to charged particles , @xmath46 , becomes small .",
    "note that this expression includes neutrons and protons bound in clusters as described in ref .",
    "the individual emission widths , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , contain a number of factors but most of these factors approximately cancel in the ratio and the largest remaining term is an exponential of the difference between the neutron and proton separation energies , @xmath49 and  @xmath50 : @xmath51 the separation energies contain the masses of the daughter isotopes , thus , we can expect an exponential dependence of the yield on the mass difference between the daughter nuclei for proton and neutron emission in this model .",
    "the masses are not known experimentally for most of the very neutron - rich nuclei in this study . in an attempt to extract the average systematic behavior",
    "the cross sections are plotted as a function of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ qg_gg ] ( right panels ) , where @xmath53 is the mass excess in mev .",
    "@xmath54 is a function that compares the relative binding energies of all of the projectile fragments without regard to the target nucleus and is a plausible basis for comparison of products from a process that creates a small set of highly excited nuclei that then statistically populate all of the available mass surface .",
    "the figure shows that this function provides an excellent systematization of the data with each isotopic chain falling on a straight line .",
    "moreover , the slopes or inverse temperatures decrease with atomic number and go from about 1.2 ( ar from be ) to a maximum of @xmath55  mev ( mg and si from be and ta ) .",
    "the line from the production of magnesium isotopes can be extrapolated to predict a cross section of @xmath56  pb for @xmath57 , as yet unobserved .",
    "the study of the production of the most neutron - rich silicon isotopes provided evidence for the existence of a new isotope , @xmath1 , in a high energy reaction that requires the net transfer of two neutrons to the projectile .",
    "the decline of the cross sections for the production of silicon isotopes with increasing mass number was found to parallel the epax parameterization but at a lower level , up to the point that neutron pickup intermediates begin to be important .",
    "the measured cross sections for nuclei with more neutrons than the projectile fall by approximately two orders of magnitude below a logarithmic extrapolation from the lighter isotopes .",
    "the variation of the cross sections for a large range of reaction products were considered in the framework of the well - known @xmath42 systematics developed for low - energy two - body reactions .",
    "only the tails of the distributions had the expected linear dependence and the applicability of this model to projectile residues from reverse kinematical reactions is entirely questionable . on the other hand ,",
    "all of the available data were shown to follow a very smooth systematic dependence , independent of the target , with the mass of the observed fragment .",
    "an extrapolation of the data using the new one - body @xmath54 systematics indicates that a search for @xmath57 is feasible .",
