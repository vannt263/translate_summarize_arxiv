    "the strong coupling @xmath7 is a central quantity for the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the gauge theory of the strong interactions  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , @xmath8 or equivalently , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) scale parameter @xmath9 has been determined from measurements of high momentum processes or from lattice gauge theory .",
    "more recently , it has also been determined from nonperturbative dynamics using the light - front holographic approach to qcd ( ads / qcd )  @xcite , an approach to color confinement that successfully describes both the hadronic spectrum and the bound - state light - front wave functions that control hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "the method used to obtain @xmath9 from ads / qcd utilizes the effective charge @xmath10 , defined from the bjorken sum rule  @xcite .",
    "it has the specific nonperturbative form @xcite : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the momentum transfer in the spin - dependent nucleon structure functions appearing in the bjorken sum rule , and @xmath2 is the fundamental ads / qcd scale parameter determined from the light hadron spectrum .",
    "this prediction for @xmath13 agrees remarkably well with experimental data for @xmath14 in the domain @xmath15gev@xmath16  @xcite where ads / qcd is applicable , and displays an infrared fixed point . in the nonperturbative domain , the relations between @xmath14 and @xmath17 in other schemes , such as the @xmath18 , mom , or v schemes are given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "such relations are obtained by first assuming that @xmath8 always has an infrared fixed point regardless of the scheme it is expressed in .",
    "then , @xmath19 is left as a free parameter to be determined by the matching procedure described below , but with @xmath9 determined by the world data .",
    "the relations between couplings in different schemes are provided in the pqcd domain by  commensurate scale relations \" @xcite , which are strict predictions of pqcd .",
    "the effective charge @xmath10 can be expressed at high momentum transfer as a perturbative expansion in the perturbative coupling @xmath20 , as defined by the @xmath18 renormalization scheme : @xmath21,\\ ] ] with the @xmath22 coefficients known up to @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 having been estimated @xcite .",
    "the normalization and evolution of @xmath10 is then determined in the @xmath18 renormalization scheme by the qcd @xmath25-function and the mass scale @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "global hadron - parton duality @xcite predicts that the nonperturbative description for @xmath14 overlaps with the pqcd expression at intermediate values of @xmath26 . matching the ads / qcd and pqcd expressions of @xmath14 and their derivatives then allows us to determine @xmath3 and the scale @xmath27 characterizing the transition between the perturbative and non - peturbative descriptions .",
    "the comparison between @xmath3 obtained from light - front holographic qcd and the world data provides a key test of this novel approach to nonperturbative qcd .",
    "it is usually argued that one determines the proton mass and other aspects of the qcd mass scale starting from a measurement of @xmath9 in the pqcd domain .",
    "this ansatz is difficult to justify since @xmath9 is renormalization scheme dependent , whereas masses or other physical observables are not .",
    "in fact , the procedure outlined above is the opposite : @xmath9 is determined in any scheme starting from the fundamental scheme independent confinement scale @xmath2 of nonperturbative qcd . since the qcd lagrangian has no mass parameter in the limit where the quark masses are neglected , the magnitude of the mass parameter @xmath2 can not be determined in fixed units by qcd itself",
    ". actually , the units normally used for mass , gev , are a convention .",
    "the key predictions are thus ratios such as @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 determines all other mass scales in the chiral limit .",
    "indeed , holographic qcd predicts the ratios of masses and mass times radius , etc .",
    "for example , it predicts @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite , etc .",
    "thus @xmath2 is in a sense a  holding parameter \" , a scale which arises from color confinement and the breaking of conformal symmetry , but it can not be determined in absolute units by qcd .",
    "in fact , the mechanism which sets the confinement scale in the limit of massless quarks is essentially unknown .    as shown in a remarkable article by de alfaro , fubini and furlan ( daff )  @xcite , it is possible to generate a mass scale @xmath2 and a confinement potential while maintaining the conformal symmetry of the action .",
    "daff write the quantum mechanical evolution operator as a superposition of the generators of the conformal group @xmath32 : the generator of time translation @xmath33 , the generator of dilatations @xmath34 , and the generator of special conformal transformations @xmath35 . since the generators of @xmath32 have different dimensions , a mass scale is introduced which in the present context plays a fundamental role , as initially conjectured in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting confining potential in the light - front hamiltonian then has the unique form of a harmonic oscillator @xmath36 , and the soft wall dilaton , which encodes the breaking of conformal symmetry in the higher dimensional anti - de sitter ads@xmath37 space , must have the form @xmath38 .",
    "the holographic variable @xmath39 in the 5-dimensional classical gravity theory is identified with the invariant transverse separation @xmath40 between the hadron constituents in the light - front quantization scheme @xcite .",
    "the harmonic form of the confining light - front potential is equivalent to the familiar linear heavy quark @xmath41 potential in the instant form @xcite and has been successful in reproducing essential non - perturbative qcd features , such as regge trajectories and the @xmath26-dependence of hadronic form factors  @xcite .    since the initial ads / qcd determination of @xmath3 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , several new developments have occurred which allow us to significantly improve the comparison between light - front holographic qcd and the world data : 1 ) the ads / qcd scale parameter @xmath2 has been determined with greater accuracy from a systematic analysis of the light - quark excitation spectra  @xcite in the context of a semiclassical superconformal approach unifying mesons and baryons  @xcite ; 2 ) the running of @xmath20 has been computed to five loops @xcite , that is the @xmath0function is now known up to order @xmath42 in the @xmath18 renormalization scheme ; and 3 ) the average world data for @xmath3 has been updated @xcite . in this article , we improve our determination of @xmath3 from the light - front holographic qcd framework  @xcite utilizing these new developments .",
    "we also study the convergence of this determination .",
    "the pqcd approximants are asymptotic poincar series that converge up to an optimal order @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the expansion parameter of the series .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the transition between the ads / qcd description of @xmath45 and its pqcd description occurs at @xmath46 gev@xmath16 in the @xmath18 scheme : the optimal order in the poincar series is thus @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , it is advantageous to use @xmath48 evaluated at five loops to obtain an accurate value of @xmath49 following the matching procedure with the nonperturbative regime described above .",
    "the perturbative series of the @xmath0 function @xmath50 calculated up to order @xmath51 yields the five - loop expression of @xmath52  @xcite : @xmath53   \\label{eq : alpha_s},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the lower order @xmath57 can be found _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite . here , we will set @xmath5 and use the updated value of the holographic qcd scale parameter , @xmath58 gev @xcite .",
    "this value characterizes the mass scale of light - quark hadron spectroscopy and is compatible with the fit to the bjorken sum data at low @xmath59 @xcite in the holographic qcd validity domain , which yields @xmath60 gev @xcite .",
    "the updated @xmath2 value is lower than but compatible with the value we used in @xcite : @xmath61 gev @xcite , with @xmath62 the @xmath63meson mass .",
    "this value is also used in the study of hadronic form factors , which are expressed in terms of @xmath63 mass poles and its radial recurrencies  @xcite .    as in ref .",

    "we obtain @xmath66 gev and @xmath67 gev@xmath16 , to be compared to the present world data , @xmath68 gev for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "( the value of @xmath69 is given in the @xmath70 scheme and is higher than that in the @xmath18 scheme @xcite . )    the uncertainties entering our determination stem from the uncertainty on @xmath2 ( @xmath71 gev ) , the uncertainty from the chiral limit approximation ( @xmath72 gev ) and the truncation uncertainty on the bjorken and @xmath52 series , eqs .",
