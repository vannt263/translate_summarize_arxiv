    "it is important to know whether a contraction group is closed .",
    "we refer the reader to the introduction in  @xcite and the references cited there for information about the applications of contraction groups and known results .",
    "recent articles which treat contraction groups are and @xcite .    the article  @xcite studied the contraction group @xmath4 and its supergroup @xmath5 in the case where the ambient group is locally compact and totally disconnected , a case in which previously little was known .",

    "* proposition  3 , parts  ( @xmath7 ) and  ( @xmath8 ) ) .",
    "the group @xmath6 was named the _ parabolic group _ of the automorphism @xmath2 in  @xcite because for any inner automorphism of a semisimple algebraic group over a local field its parabolic group is the group of rational points of a rational parabolic subgroup ( and every such group is of that form ) ; the corresponding contraction group in that case is the group of rational points of the unipotent radical of the parabolic subgroup . in this algebraic group context , identifying parabolic subgroups ( in the dynamical sense , introduced above ) and their unipotent radicals with parabolic subgroups ( in the algebraic group sense ) and the corresponding contraction groups is a crucial technique used by g. prasad to prove strong approximation for semisimple groups in positive characteristic @xcite .",
    "this technique was later used again by g. prasad to give a simple proof of tits s theorem on cocompactness of open non - compact subgroups in simple algebraic groups over local fields @xcite , which can be proved also by appealing to howe - moore s property .    in this article",
    "we investigate which contraction groups of inner automorphisms in complete kac - moody groups are closed .",
    "complete kac - moody groups ( which we introduce in section  [ sec : frame ] ) are combinatorial generalizations of semisimple algebraic groups over local fields .",
    "in contrast to members of the latter class of groups , complete kac - moody groups are generically , totally disconnected , locally compact groups . these properties make them perfect test cases for the developing structure theory of totally disconnected , locally compact groups which was established in  @xcite , and further advanced in  @xcite and  .",

    "the contraction group of any topologically periodic element in @xmath1 is trivial . 2 .",
    "if the type of @xmath0 is irreducible and neither spherical nor affine , then the contraction group of any element that is not topologically periodic in @xmath1 is not closed .",
    "furthermore , the group @xmath1 contains non - topologically periodic elements whenever @xmath0 is not of spherical type .",
    "the second assertion of theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] is in sharp contrast with the known results about contraction groups of elements in spherical and affine kac - moody groups .",

    "consequently , all contraction groups of inner automorphisms are closed for certain affine kac - moody groups , namely those that are geometric completions of chevalley group schemes over the rings of laurent polynomials over finite fields . for completions of kac - moody groups of any spherical type the same is seen to be true ; see part  1 of proposition  [ prop : contrgs(spherical , known - affine ) ] .    thus theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] and proposition",

    "the groups covered by the second part of our main theorem are topologically simple  @xcite , indeed in many cases algebraically simple  @xcite groups , whose flat rank assumes all positive integral values  @xcite , and indeed are the first known groups who have non - closed contraction groups and whose flat rank can be larger than  @xmath11 ; we refer the reader to   for the definition of flat rank .",

    "whenever @xmath58 leaves @xmath91 , necessarily at a wall , use elements of the corresponding root group @xmath90 which fixes @xmath97 to ` fold @xmath58 into @xmath91 ' .",
    "this needs to be done at increasing distance from @xmath97 along @xmath58 ` on both sides ' , leading to an infinite product of elements from root groups .",
    "the sequence consisting of the partial products of that infinite product is contained in the stabilizer of @xmath97 , which is a compact set .",
    "hence that sequence has a convergent subsequence , which implies that the infinite product defined above is convergent , with limit @xmath9 say . by construction",
    ", @xmath9 attains the purpose of the element of the same name in the statement of the proposition and we are done .",
    "the second step in the proof of statment  2 of theorem  [ thm : strongmainthm ] consists of the following strengthening of theorem  14 in  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : fundamental - hyperbolic - configuration_line ] let @xmath91 be a coxeter complex , whose type is irreducible and neither spherical nor affine .",
    "suppose that @xmath98 is a geodesic line .",

    "since the coxeter complex is not of spherical type , there is another wall @xmath103 which cuts @xmath58 , but not @xmath73 .",
    "call @xmath83 the root whose boundary is @xmath103 and which contains the ray @xmath102 for sufficiently large @xmath100 . the existence of a root @xmath81 as in the statement is then assured by theorem  14 in  @xcite , which completes the proof .",
    "the third and final step in the proof of statment  2 of theorem  [ thm : strongmainthm ] is an immediate consequence of our assumption that root groups are contractive and the geometric criterion for membership in contraction groups .",
    "[ lem : ] let @xmath1 be a group which contains the root groups of a group with twin root datum all of whose root groups are contractive .",

    "hence , @xmath53 is not closed .",
    "since the root group @xmath85 is contractive , lemma  [ lem : contractiongs_geo ] ensures that it is contained in any contraction group @xmath106 with the property that the repelling fixed point of @xmath107 at infinity is defined by a ray that is contained in the interior of the half - apartment defined by @xmath108 . both @xmath49 and @xmath109",
    "satisfy this condition on @xmath107 , hence @xmath105 as claimed .",

    ", we will show that the lift of an element @xmath34 in the weyl group is topologically periodic if and only if @xmath34 has finite order .",

    "if that element @xmath63 is obtained as an inverse image of an element , @xmath34 say , of the weyl group , it belongs to the stabilizer of the standard apartment @xmath91 .",
    "since the davis - realization @xmath93 of the standard apartment is a complete , convex subspace of the complete @xmath19-space @xmath21 , using the nearest - point projection from @xmath21 onto @xmath93 , we see that the action of @xmath63 on @xmath21 has a fixed point if and only if its restricted action on @xmath93 has a fixed point .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to the condition that the natural action of @xmath34 on @xmath93 has a fixed point . since this happens if and only if @xmath34 has finite order , our claim is proved .",
