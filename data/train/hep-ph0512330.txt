    "the deviation of the electron @xmath4 value from 2 predicted by dirac s theory was first confirmed by an experiment on atomic spectrum @xcite .",
    "schwinger showed that this deviation can be explained as the effect of radiative correction by the relativistic renormalized qed which he had developed @xcite .",
    "together with the discovery of lamb shift in the spectrum of hydrogen atom @xcite , it provided convincing experimental evidence that ( until then discredited ) qed is capable of predicting the effect of electromagnetic interaction precisely , provided that it is renormalized .        the precision of measurement has thus been improved by seven orders of magnitude over 40 years .",
    "this enormous improvement in measurement was matched by the improvement of theory of radiative correction to the electron g-2 from the order @xmath7 to the order @xmath0 , leading to the most stringent test of the validity of qed .",
    "the uncertainty of the experiment ( [ ae - seattle ] ) was dominated by the cavity shift due to the interaction of the electron with the hyperboloid cavity , which has a very complicated resonance structure .",
    "several efforts were made to reduced this uncertainty @xcite .",
    "one of them is to replace the hyperboloid cavity by a cylindrical cavity , which allows analytic computation of the structure of the resonance @xcite .",
    "gabrielse s new measurement of the electron g-2 is based on this analysis .",
    "recently a preliminary result of this measurement was reported , which is 7.5 times more precise than ( [ ae - seattle])@xcite .",
    "the qed contribution to the electron g-2 can be written as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , can be expanded as @xmath10 the first four coefficients of @xmath11 are @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are known analytically @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 was obtained by both numerical @xcite and analytic integrations @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is obtained thus far by numerical integration only @xcite .",
    "its uncertainty has been reduced by 10 compared with the old one @xcite .",
    "although it has been evaluated by one method only , it has been subjected to an extensive cross - checking among diagrams of 8th - order and also with 6th- , 4th- , and 2nd - order diagrams .",
    "@xmath17 terms are small : @xmath18 the contribution of @xmath19 term is even smaller ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the non - qed contribution of the standard model are also known @xcite @xmath21 to compare the theory with the measured value of @xmath22 one needs a value of @xmath7 obtained by some non - qed measurement .",
    "the best available @xmath7 at present is @xcite @xmath23~. \\label{cesium}\\ ] ] this leads to @xmath24 where 0.10 is the remaining uncertainty of the @xmath0 term , 0.26 is based on an educated guess ( @xmath25 ) made by mohr and taylor @xcite , and 8.48 is the uncertainty in the measurement ( [ cesium ] ) .",
    "the error 8.48 is still large but is within a factor 2 of the error of the seattle measurement ( [ ae - seattle ] ) .",
    "the last and best of three measurements of the muon g-2 at cern had an uncertainty of 7 ppm @xcite .",
    "after years of hard work the muon g-2 measurement at the brookhaven national laboratory has come close to the design goal ( 0.35 ppm ) : @xcite @xmath26 the world average of @xmath27 obtained by combining this and earlier measurements @xcite is @xmath28      currently , the prediction of the standard model reflects the difficulty in the treatment of the hadronic contribution @xcite .",
    "the lowest - order hadronic vacuum - polarization effect on @xmath29 has thus far been determined from three sources ,    \\(i ) @xmath30 annihilation cross section ,    \\(ii ) hadronic @xmath31 decays ,    \\(iii ) @xmath32   [ radiative return ] .",
    "the process ( i ) has been analyzed by many groups over years .",
    "some recent results are @xcite @xmath33 recent estimate of hadronic light - by - light scattering contribution is @xcite @xmath34 the electroweak interaction effect is known to two - loop order : @xcite @xmath35 where ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the second line are estimates of remaining theoretical uncertainty and higgs mass uncertainty , respectively .",
    "the qed contribution to the muon g-2 can be written as @xmath36 renormalizability of qed guarantees that the functions @xmath11 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 can be expanded in power series in @xmath37 with finite calculable coefficients : @xmath38 @xmath11 in ( [ amuqed ] ) is identical with @xmath11 of ( [ aeqed ] ) and has been evaluated to the eighth ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) order . as for @xmath17 and @xmath19",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath40 since they have no corresponding feynman diagram .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 terms have been evaluated accurately by power series expansion in @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "thus far @xmath46 and @xmath47 are known mostly by numerical integration .",
    "the qed contribution @xmath48 , even though it is the predominant term of @xmath29 , has received little attention for many years because of its small error bars .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty came predominantly from the @xmath0 term whose contribution to @xmath29 is about 3.3 ppm .",
    "recently we have completed a new evaluation of the @xmath0 term in which all contributing terms have been evaluated by two or more independent calculations , uncovering an error in some diagrams @xcite and eliminating the @xmath0 term as a possible source of theoretical uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this causes the qed contribution shifted to @xmath49 where 0.03 is the remaining uncertainty of the @xmath0 term , an improvement of factor 40 over the previous result @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty 1.15 comes from a crude estimate of the contribution of the @xmath1 term , which now stands out as the largest source of uncertainty in @xmath29(qed ) .",
    "the error 0.85 comes from the uncertainty in the value of @xmath7 given in ( [ cesium ] ) .",
    "the prediction of the standard model , including the hadronic vacuum - polarization , hadronic light - by - light contributions , and the electroweak effect , is @xmath50 where the uncertainty in theory is mostly due to the hadronic vacuum - polarization term .",
    "a very important byproduct of the study of @xmath22 is that it gives the best value of the fine structure constant @xmath7 available at present .",
    "if we use the new experiment by the harvard group , the precision of @xmath7 is almost an order of magnitude better than any other measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty of this measurement is only a factor 2 larger than that of theory , which is mostly from the @xmath1 term , since the @xmath0 term is known with small error .",
    "thus , when the measurement of @xmath22 is improved further , reduction of the uncertainty of @xmath1 term will become crucial in order to obtain a better @xmath51 .    for the muon the old estimate of @xmath52 was 930 ( 170 ) , which contributes only 0.054 ppm to @xmath29 , well within the current experimental uncertainty .",
    "thus improving @xmath52 is not urgent .",
    "however , it will become an important source of error in the next generation of @xmath29 experiment .",
    "this is why it is desirable to obtain a better value of @xmath52 .",
    "the preliminary value of @xmath53 was reported in @xcite .",
    "thus far only a small portion of tenth - order diagrams contributing to the muon g-2 have been evaluated analytically @xcite , or numerically @xcite .",
    "rough estimates based on the renormalization group and other considerations have been made in order to identify leading terms @xcite .",
    "of course an enormous amount of work is required to go beyond this and evaluate @xmath1 terms completely .",
    "fortunately , for the muon g-2 the leading contribution comes from those feynman diagrams which contain @xmath54 terms whose sources can be readily identified as light - by - light - scattering subdiagrams and vacuum - polarization insertions .",
    "thus relatively modest amount of work will enable us to improve the value of @xmath55 over the previous crude estimate .",
    "on the other hand , the electron g-2 , in particular @xmath56 term , is much harder to evaluate . besides its gigantic size",
    "none of 12672 diagrams is dominant so that every term must be evaluated accurately .    for both @xmath22 and @xmath29",
    "the first step is to count and classify feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath1 term .",
    "the contribution to the mass - independent term @xmath56 may be classified into six gauge - invariant sets , which further subdivided into 32 gauge - invariant subsets , depending on the nature of subdiagrams ( of the vacuum - polarization ( _ v - p _ ) type or light - by - light - scattering ( _",
