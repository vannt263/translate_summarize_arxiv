    "it is clear that such transformations preserve the lebesgue measure .",
    "in fact this is often the unique invariant measure : masur in @xcite and veech in @xcite have shown that if the permutation @xmath1 is irreducible , then for lebesgue - almost every @xmath2 \\in \\mathbb{p}^{d-1}_+$ ] , the i.e.t .",

    "let us recall some previous advances in the problem of the prevalence of weak mixing among interval exchange transformations .",
    "partial results in this direction had been obtained by katok and stepin @xcite , who proved weak mixing for almost all i.e.t.s on 3 intervals . in @xcite , veech has shown that weak mixing holds for infinitely many irreducible permutations .",
    "the question of almost sure weak mixing for i.e.t.s was first fully answered by forni and the first author in @xcite , where the following result is proved :    let @xmath1 be an irreducible permutation of @xmath28 which is not a rotation . for lebesgue",

    "although translation flows can be seen as suspension flows over i.e.t.s , the second result is not a direct consequence of the first one since the property of weak mixing is not invariant under suspensions and time changes .",
    "+ note that the previous results tell nothing about zero measure subsets of the moduli space of translation surfaces ; in particular , the question of weak mixing was still open for translation flows on veech surfaces , which are exceptionally symmetric translation surfaces associated to the dynamics of rational polygonal billiards .",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite by delecroix and the first author :    the geodesic flow in a non - arithmetic veech surface is weakly mixing in almost every direction .",
    "indeed , the set of exceptional directions has hausdorff dimension less than one .",
    "the proof of almost sure weak mixing in @xcite is based on some parameter exclusion ; however this reasoning is not adapted to the particular case of translation flows on veech surfaces . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have developed another strategy to deal with the problem of prevalent weak mixing , based on considerations on hausdorff dimension and its link to some property that we refer to as _ fast decay _ in what follows ( see subsection [ fastdecaydefin ] for the definition ) .",

    "the analysis is based on the following process : given a little segment @xmath53 near the origin , its image by the cocycle may again contain a point near some element @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath55 , the corresponding line is called a _ trivial child _ of @xmath53 .",
    "else , we translate the image of @xmath53 by @xmath56 to bring it back to the origin , and we call this new segment a _ non - trivial child _ of @xmath53 . note that there may be several non - trivial children .",
    "the goal of the study is to show that for most @xmath2 $ ] , this process has finite life expectancy , that is , the family generated by a line is finite .    a key ingredient in the  local \"",
    "analysis near the origin is the existence of two positive lyapunov exponents for surfaces of genus at least @xmath57 . for a fixed segment not passing through the origin ,",
    "the biggest lyapunov exponent is responsible for the growth of the length of its iterates by the cocycle , while the second biggest generates a drift that tends to kick them further away from the origin .",
    "the second part of the argument corresponds to a  global \" analysis which handles the fact that points near the origin may become close to another integer element under cocycle iteration . to address this point , forni and the first author",
    "have developed a probabilistic argument .",

    "since the set @xmath14 is finite , it is possible to ensure that when the matrix we apply belongs to @xmath14 , the only potential child is trivial , and moreover , such an element kicks each line further from the origin by at least a given factor .",
    "it follows that for a typical @xmath2 $ ] and for every line @xmath53 , the process has finite life expectancy : for every @xmath46 and every line @xmath53 , there exists some integer @xmath60 such that @xmath61 ) = \\emptyset$ ] .    in the present paper ,",
    "we adapt the estimates obtained in @xcite to show that for every line @xmath53 , the measure of the set of @xmath2 $ ] such that the process survives up to time @xmath52 goes to zero exponentially fast with respect to @xmath52 : if @xmath62 denotes the set of @xmath2 $ ] such that @xmath63 ) \\neq \\emptyset$ ] , we get that @xmath64 for some constants",
    "we give here a proof of this fact using a general large deviations result obtained in @xcite .",
    "but by @xcite , we know that the decay of the volumes @xmath66 can be converted into a bound on the hausdorff dimension of @xmath67 . since these sets are intimately related to the weak - stable lamination , we thus get a control of the hausdorff dimension of `` bad '' parameters @xmath2 $ ] , which concludes .",
    "for the case of translation flows , we use the parametrization @xmath35)$ ] that comes from veech s zippered rectangle construction . for a fixed parameter @xmath41 and any integer @xmath60 , as for interval exchange transformations",
    ", we can estimate the measure of the set of `` bad '' parameters @xmath2 $ ] at time @xmath52 ; this allows us to construct a cover of this set of parameters .",
    "then , if we consider some @xmath68 exponentially close to @xmath41 , then for any `` bad '' parameter @xmath69 $ ] , we have two cases : either the iterates of the cocycle grow very fast ( by some large deviations result , this happens very rarely ) , or @xmath69 $ ] belongs to some piece of the cover constructed for @xmath41 ; in other terms , the previous cover can be taken locally constant with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "thus for each integer @xmath60 , we obtain a cover of `` bad '' parameters @xmath35)$ ] at time @xmath52 , and we can then estimate the hausdorff dimension of non weakly mixing parameters .",
    "as we have explained , the property of weak mixing for i.e.t.s is related to the dynamics of a cocycle @xmath39 defined in parameter space .",
    "an important fact is that the map @xmath70 we consider has a property called _ bounded distortion _ ; indeed it is crucial for the probabilistic argument that we outlined , in particular to get some large deviations result . in this section , we will see that under some assumptions , it can be checked when the map @xmath70 is obtained by restriction to a simplex compactly contained in the projective space .",
    "another important point is that the cocycle @xmath39 is _ fast decaying _ ; we will recall this notion and see how it can be used to give a bound on the hausdorff dimension of certain sets .",
