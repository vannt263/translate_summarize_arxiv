    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) has been applied in physics as well as in various other scientific disciplines @xcite . in physics ,",
    "the most notable applications of rmt are found in statistical nuclear physics , quantum chaotic systems , and mesoscopic and disordered systems .",
    "rmt facilitates a theoretical understanding of the spectral correlations of a physical or a model complex system .",
    "an important aspect of rmt is the universality of spectral correlations , making the results of the classical rmt ensembles , viz .",
    "the gaussian ensembles , useful in many fields .",
    "parameter - dependent rmt models @xcite also yield universal results @xcite .",
    "these models are applicable to complex systems in which spectral statistics is governed by an external parameter . in these models",
    "one may also consider spectral cross correlations at different parameter values @xcite .",
    "such spectral correlations are associated with the level motion with respect to the parameter , and they are referred to as parametric level correlations .",
    "these correlations have been studied extensively , and their universality has been tested in diverse systems , e. g. , a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field with the strength of the field as the parameter , resonances in quartz blocks at a uniform temperature where the temperature is an external parameter , and chaotic billiards where aharonov - bohm flux or the background potential or boundary parameters are treated as an external parameter @xcite . in these studies , analytic results for the density - density correlation function @xcite are of fundamental importance , and they have been obtained using the supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath0-model for disordered systems .",
    "recent studies of the parametric spectral cross - form factor and the fidelity @xcite reemphasized the importance of parametric correlations .",
    "in addition to the above references we also mention ref .",
    "@xcite , which made important contributions to the study of parametric correlations .    to estimate",
    "how long the correlations are sustained in a parameter - driven complex system , it is suggestive to study integrated measures such as a number variance . in this context",
    "such a measure appears in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion , it is a non - local measure as it involves variance of the staircase function from the ground state .",
    "this motivated us to introduce the number covariance as a local measure to study the parametric correlations .",
    "it is defined as the covariance of the number of energy levels in intervals of fixed length between spectra for two values of the parameter . by definition",
    "it is local , and thus it fulfills the basic requirement for applying the rmt .",
    "the number covariance can be calculated numerically from the above - mentioned density - density correlation function , which is known in the form of a multiple integral , or from the spectral cross - form factor which is somewhat simpler .",
    "it is surprising that while many measures have been used in this context , the number covariance , which is a natural quantity to use for comparison with numerical data , has not been investigated .    in this paper",
    "we consider the binary correlation method @xcite to derive compact expressions for the number covariance .",
    "it turns out to be very close to the results obtained from numerical integrations of the exact correlation functions .",
    "we show that our results agree extremely well with the number covariance calculated for the spectra of quantum kicked rotors introduced in @xcite .",
    "we also consider a local version of the measure proposed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the three invariant gaussian ensembles ( ges ) of hermitian matrices @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 , viz . the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , and the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) .",
    "we use the dyson index @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively for these ensembles @xcite .",
    "the joint probability density of matrix elements is given by @xmath6 . here",
    "the @xmath7 are the variances for @xmath3 distinct classes of the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "parametric variations in the ges are described with respect to a parameter @xmath8 by the ensembles of matrices , @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 . here",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath12 belong to the same invariance class of the gaussian ensembles , and they are independently distributed .",
    "it is worth pointing out that similar models are defined for the crossover ensembles @xcite with the matrices corresponding to different symmetry classes .",
    "variance @xmath7 is the same for @xmath13 , and @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath9 and @xmath11 are identically distributed gaussian ensembles with correlation coefficient @xmath14 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "the scale of the spectral statistics is supplied by @xmath7 , which we fix by @xmath18 @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath2 , the ensembles - averaged spectral density , @xmath19 ,",
    "is described by wigner s semicircle law @xcite , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "notice that the same density is valid for all @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce the number covariance , @xmath22 , which is defined as the covariance of the number of levels in the interval @xmath23 $ ] for @xmath9 and @xmath11 . in the limit of large @xmath2 ,",
    "the number covariance becomes a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the average number of eigenvalues in @xmath23 $ ] , and @xmath25 is the rescaled parameter defined by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average level spacing .",
    "we remark that @xmath25 depends on @xmath29 since @xmath30 depends on @xmath29 .",
    "it has been shown in transition studies @xcite that , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the transition in the two - point correlation is abrupt as a function of @xmath8 but smooth with respect to @xmath25 . in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
