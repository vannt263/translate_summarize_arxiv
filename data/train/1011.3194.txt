    "potential - scattering theory describes systems with a localized scattering region and a potential - free region far away from the scatterer .",
    "an incoming plane wave arrives at the scatterer and the changes of the phase and the direction of the incoming wave reveal properties of the scatterer . while this setup is convenient for the description of collision experiments with particle beams , in many other situations matter - waves originate from a localized region in space where a potential is present .",
    "the latter situation is the topic of this course . in this case",
    "the formulation and solution of scattering theory is best achieved in a time - dependent fashion . instead of asymptotic potential - free regions in space , scattering is recast as an initial value problem , which provides a direct connection to the initial value problems familiar from classical mechanics .",
    "in quantum mechanics , the time - evolution of an initial state is governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath0|\\psi(t)\\rangle=0.\\ ] ] for propagating an arbitrary initial state , the basic object of interest is the propagator ( or feynman kernel ) @xmath1 , which advances the initial state @xmath2 from initial time @xmath3 to a later time @xmath4 : @xmath5 for hamiltonians which do not explicitly depend on time , many propagators are available in analytic form @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for explicit time - dependent hamiltonians only few results are known , most of which are related to the existence of ermakov invariants @xcite .",
    "if the initial state @xmath6 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , the propagation will preserve the initial shape of the probability density and the state merely acquires a time - dependent phase , oscillating with the eigenenergy of the state .",
    "if we propagate any other state ( which in principle can be decomposed into a superposition of eigenstates ) the initial density distribution will change shape and move in space .",
    "a very instructive example is the moshinsky shutter @xcite , where the sudden opening of the shutter gives rise to transient effects .",
    "an important problem concerns the range of validity of the sudden and the adiabatic perturbation theories , which should be applicable for fast or slow changes of the hamiltonian , respectively . for the case of the moshinsky shutter with adjustable shutter opening - time the perturbative and the exact results",
    "are given and analyzed by scheitler and kleber @xcite .",
    "transient effects are also the topic of a recent comprehensive review article @xcite . besides transient effects , many systems display characteristic revival phenomena .",
    "revivals bring back part of the time - evolved wave - packet to its initial position and can lead to complete or partial reconstructions of the initial density distribution @xcite .",
    "revival phenomena have been analyzed in detail for rydberg states of the hydrogen atom , and also recently for electronic wave packets in mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "here , we first give a brief introduction into the time- and energy - dependent propagator and green function of the schrdinger equation , and proceed to discuss applications of the time - dependent picture in the photodetachment of negative ions .",
    "the next section shows how to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically and how to obtain the spectrum of molecular systems . in the last section we model transport through semiconductor devices and",
    "finally discuss the effects on interactions and boundary conditions on the transport through nanodevices in a magnetic field .",
    "the energy - dependent counterpart of the time - dependent kernel is the energy - dependent green function @xmath7 where the limit @xmath8 selects the retarded solution",
    ". only few closed forms of energy - dependent green functions are known and the numerical integration over the highly oscillatory propagator fails to give converging results .",
    "these difficulties are related to the representation of the identity in position space as a @xmath9-distribution @xmath10 the fourier transform of the @xmath9-distribution in position representation is a constant function in momentum space and signifies that the energy - dependent green function is the solution of the inhomogeneous stationary schrdinger equation for all energies @xmath11g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}';e)=\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}').\\ ] ] however , in most physical applications the energy and the momenta are limited to a certain range of interest and thus it is possible to replace the @xmath9-distribution for example by a localized gaussian function @xmath12 , which also represents a gaussian momentum distribution .",
    "this step can also be done in a more formal way using coherent states , or by switching to the bargmann representation @xcite .",
