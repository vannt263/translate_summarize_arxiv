    "interface physics of strongly correlated oxides is a rapidly developing branch of materials science . in heterostructures of ultrathin correlated oxide films ,",
    "charge and spin states are reconstructed at the interfaces and hence affect the electronic properties of the entire system @xcite .",
    "this interface - controlled behavior provides new opportunities for oxide - film electronics , where a powerful tool for tuning the heterostructure properties is the electric field @xcite . in high - temperature superconducting oxides ,",
    "electric fields can be used to switch between superconducting and insulating states by electrostatically tuning the free carrier density @xcite .",
    "in contrast to chemical doping , where the modifications in the doping level are inevitably related to changes in chemical bonding and microstructure , the field - effect experiments are expected to only modify charge , keeping the microstructure fixed .    in superconducting field - effect transistors ( sufet s ) , an electric field",
    "is applied to a dielectric gate and sweeps charge carriers into a htsc - film in the drain - source channel .",
    "the gate polarization attracts the injected carriers at the gate / film - interface .",
    "it thereby creates an accumulation region with a shifted local @xmath2 which , for a nm - thick film , should result in a tuning of the global @xmath2 . with the assumption of a fixed interface microstructure , the field - induced @xmath2 shift should be fully determined by the electric field doping . however , whereas in underdoped htsc cuprate films the observed @xmath2 shift is about @xmath3@xmath4  k , in the overdoped films @xmath2 is not substantially changed by the field @xcite .",
    "this striking doping dependence is usually explained in terms of a thomas - fermi screening length @xmath5 which suggests a stronger exponential decay of accumulated charge inside the overdoped films with higher total carrier density .",
    "however , in anisotropic systems , the quantum mechanically determined spread of the charge from the interface is greater and decays slower , in distinction to the classical thomas - fermi approach @xcite .",
    "as the cuprate films contain cuo@xmath6-planes with an interplanar distance @xmath7  nm , only a particular amount of injected charge is accumulated in the first plane at the interface , and the rest is redistributed in the @xmath8@xmath9 nearest planes @xcite . in these multilayers , the charge confinement to the first plane increases for higher total charge densities in the film @xcite .",
    "consequently , in the underdoped cuprate film , despite larger @xmath5 , the low carrier density results in @xmath10 of confined charge ( mechanisms to achieve stronger confinement have been studied in ref .  ) . in the overdoped film , about @xmath11 of the injected charge",
    "is confined @xcite . as in both cases the calculated field - accumulated charge densities are roughly equal",
    ", one should expect similar shifts of @xmath2 _ both in the under- and overdoped films_. this similarity implies that without consideration of the microscopic processes at the gate / film interface , the field doping alone can not satisfactorily explain the doping dependences of the @xmath2 shift .    in a typical sufet",
    ", the strong modulation of injected carriers requires a gate polarization in the range @xmath12@xmath13  c/@xmath14 . to achieve this polarization ,",
    "one uses gates with dielectric constant @xmath15 in the range @xmath16@xmath17 , fabricated from complex perovskite transition metal oxides like srtio@xmath18 ( sto ) . here ,",
    "extensive studies @xcite show that a fundamental property is the hybridization of oxygen ( o ) @xmath19- and transition metal ( ti ) @xmath20-orbitals caused by the ti  o - displacements .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath21 of a small amount of injected holes with the hybridized @xmath19-@xmath20 electrons in the insulating gate remains almost unscreened , @xmath22@xmath8  ev  the spatial distance between the nearest interface unit cells of gate and film is about @xmath23@xmath3   .",
    "moreover , the holes strongly interact with optical tio - phonons which polarize the interface .",
    "these excitation processes at the interface can possibly lead to charge localization .",
    "a further reason for interface charge trapping can be an increased disorder at the cuprate / sto - interface which can lead to anderson localization .",
    "in fact , interface localization is experimentally supported by a hysteresis of the normal state resistance and by the voltage dependence of the hole mobility in htsc / sto - heterostructures @xcite .",
    "there are also clear experimental indications that in organic field effect transistors , where a similar mechanism of the electric field effect applies , the carrier mobility decreases with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite    as a step towards an understanding of the cooperative interface phenomena in correlated oxides , we present a theoretical study of field - doped heterostructures , whereby we focus on two key aspects : ( i ) the interaction of the injected charge carriers with @xmath19-@xmath20-electrons in the dielectric gate , and ( ii ) the coupling of carriers to dynamical lattice distortions .",
    "we find that these processes at the gate / film interface result in dramatic modifications of the superconducting state with increasing field - induced carrier density .",
    "to analyze the field dependence of the @xmath19-@xmath20 hybridization at the gate interface , we introduce a model on a 2d - square lattice containing @xmath24 sites , where each site corresponds to a perovskite unit cell . in each o@xmath25-octahedron of the @xmath26-th cell we consider a single tio ionic group with a dynamical covalent bond along the field direction perpendicular to the gate / film - interface ( shown in fig .",

    ", the gate electric field @xmath32 affects the @xmath19-@xmath20-electron transfer : @xmath33 the energy gap @xmath34 is about @xmath35  ev in perovskite dielectric states , but decreases down to @xmath36  ev in ferroelectric films due to modifications of surface electronic states @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic interaction @xmath37 of the gate field with the dipole moment , @xmath38 , of the electron transfer increases the @xmath19-@xmath20 level splitting and thus tends to localize the tio - electron . here",
    "@xmath39 is the electron charge and @xmath40    is the ti - o distance .",
    "the energy gap @xmath34 in ( [ dg1 ] ) refers to @xmath41 . in a nonzero electric field , which induces a polarization @xmath42 ,",
    "the field - dependent tio - distortions @xmath43 imply @xmath44 .",
    "the field effect can be taken into account via the expansion of @xmath45 in powers of @xmath46 : @xmath47 , which determines the `` susceptibility '' @xmath48 . in thin sto films",
    ", the high concentration of oxygen vacancies leads to local polar regions and to a quasistatic polarization @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite the additional , maximal electric field - induced polarization is comparable to @xmath50 and the influence of @xmath32 on @xmath51 is relatively weak compared to the effect produced by the polar regions .",
    "therefore , for the considered range of @xmath52  v / cm , we have @xmath53 and consequently we take @xmath54 in ( [ dg1 ] ) .    furthermore , we assume that the barrier for a @xmath19-@xmath20-transfer ( described by the second term in ( [ dg1 ] ) ) is modified by the interface coupling to the carriers in the superconducting film @xmath55 we consider in ( [ dg_s ] ) the coupling with holes , where @xmath56 is the electron number operator with spin @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the mechanism ( [ dg_s ] ) can lead to a local effective attraction between the injected carriers , which has recently been analyzed for weak - coupling @xmath59-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the role of the tio - distortions is more subtle .",
    "as shown in ref .  , the coupling of the injected charge to a static displacement only shifts the chemical potential in the film .",
    "consequently , we neglect the coupling to static distortions and we focus instead on dynamical tio - displacements .",
    "we are interested in the coupling to the low - energy soft to@xmath60-mode , the polar component of which is hardened up to @xmath61@xmath62  @xmath63 at low @xmath64 in sto thin films in electric fields @xcite .",
    "also , we consider higher - energy polar phonons like the to@xmath6- ( @xmath65  @xmath63 ) or the to@xmath66-mode ( @xmath67  @xmath63 ) . at the gate / film - interface , such tio - displacements are coupled to the holes in the film @xmath68 where the phonon operators @xmath69(@xmath70 ) refer to a particular tio - mode of energy @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the hole - phonon coupling , and @xmath73 is the polaron binding energy .    in the superconducting film ,",
    "we focus only on the first plane ( ideal confinement ) without detailed analysis of the interplanar charge redistribution .",
    "we treat the film in terms of a 2d - hubbard model which contains on - site correlations with a nearest and next - nearest tight - binding dispersion @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are electron creation operators .",
    "we choose the typical values @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for the doped cu @xmath79 band , the effective hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) describes the motion of hole singlets through the lattice of cu@xmath80-ions in cuo@xmath6-planes .",
    "these spin singlets are formed by the cu hole and the o hole of the o - plaquette which is hybridized with the @xmath20-states of cu@xmath80 ions .",
    "@xcite    the combined model ( [ dg1])([hubbard ] ) now presents a field - driven two - layer interface system in which the strongly correlated charge carriers in the film are coupled to tio - excitons and to phonon states of the gate .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a possible bonding at a cuo@xmath6/sto - interface . here",

    "in addition , in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also obtain an attractive correction to the one - site repulsion @xmath86 . to analyze the resulting electronic parameters in the film , we first derive an effective hubbard model by tracing over phonon and exciton degrees of freedom and subsequently we map this system onto a @xmath0@xmath1-model with an effective spin exchange energy @xmath87 .",

    "for the considered range of @xmath21 , the attractive corrections @xmath94 to @xmath86 are small , @xmath95 , and result in a maximal increase of @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , in distinction to weak - coupling superconductors @xcite , this contribution of the @xmath19-@xmath20 transfer to the increase of @xmath2 is insignificant .",

    "this signifies that the reduced kinetic energy at sufficient concentration of holes triggers the polaronic localization transition @xcite .",

    "alternatively , we propose to use multilayered cuprates with @xmath35@xmath3 cuo@xmath6-planes in a unit cell to delocalize the holes .",
    "due to the small interplanar distance of @xmath184    in some compounds , the polaron - suppressed hopping in the interface plane is in turn enhanced by the interplanar coupling to the subsequent planes .",
    "we found that the cooperative effect of interface hybridization and lattice dynamics in strongly correlated superconducting heterostructures is of crucial importance to their superconducting properties .",
    "the interface - caused suppression of @xmath2 for higher doping is a possible explanation of the differences in the electric field effect in overdoped and underdoped sufets @xcite .",
