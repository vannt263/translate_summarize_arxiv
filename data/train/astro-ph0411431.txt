    "the detection of faint sources in far ir can be greatly affected by the amount and structure of the background radiation .",
    "the main source of background radiation in far ir is the smooth component of the galactic emission , known as cirrus emission .",
    "the amount of emission manifests itself as photon noise whose fluctuations follow poisson statistics .",
    "in addition , any brightness fluctuation at scales below the beam size could cause confusion with real point sources .",
    "the cirrus emission was discovered by the infrared astronomy satellite ( _ iras _ ) @xcite , and is thought to be due to radiatively heated interstellar dust in irregular clouds of wide ranges of spatial scales .",
    "the cirrus emission peaks at far - ir wavelengths but was detected in all four _ iras _ bands at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath1 m ( helou & beichman 1990 , hereafter hb0 ) .",
    "the brightness of cirrus emission depends upon the galactic latitude and is significant for wavelengths longer than 60 @xmath1 m .",
    "the cirrus emission , which is the main source of background radiation in far - ir , causes an uncertainty in the determination of source fluxes use its brightness varies from place to place .",
    "the accurate determination of observational detection limits requires a knowledge of the cirrus emission as a function of position on the sky .",
    "the other important factor affecting the source detection is the source confusion which mainly depends upon the telescope beam size and the source distribution itself .",
    "the effects resulting from a combination of the sky confusion and the source confusion will be discussed in depth in the forthcoming paper [ jeong et al .",
    "2004c , in preparation ] , and we concentrate on the effect of sky confusion in the present paper .",
    "there have been realistic estimations of the sky confusion from observational data from _ iras _ and the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) ( gautier et al . 1992 ; hb90 ; herbstmeier et al .",
    "1998 ; kiss et al . 2001 ) . however , the resolution of the data from _ iras _ and _ iso _ is not sufficient to the application to larger missions planned in future .",
    "many valuable data in the far - ir wavelength range will be available within or around this decade by a multitude of ir space projects such as _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , _ astro - f _ @xcite , herschel space observatory ( _ hso _ ) @xcite and the space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ spica _ ) @xcite .",
    "since these instruments will observe the sky with high sensitivities and high angular resolution , it is necessary to understand the factors determining their detection limits .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effects of cirrus emission on the detection of faint point sources in highly sensitive future infrared observations .",
    "based on the measured power spectrum and the spectral energy distribution models of the dust emission over the entire sky , we generate the dust map with higher spatial resolution in various relevant wavelength bands by extrapolating the power spectrum to small scales .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sky_conf ] , we briefly describe the sky confusion noise due to sky brightness fluctuations . in section [ sec : gen_dmap ] , the high angular resolution realization of galactic dust emission in various ir bands is presented . based upon the specifications of each ir mission , we estimate the sky confusion noise by using simple fluctuation analysis in section [ sec : stat_analy_scn ] .",
    "we compare estimated detection limits based on fluctuation analysis with the results based on the photometry on realistically simulated data in section [ sec : scn_phot ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "measuring the brightness of sources involves subtracting the sky background derived from the well - defined reference .",
    "the fluctuations in the surface brightness of extended structure on similar scales to the resolution of the telescope and instrument beam can produce spurious events that can be easily mistaken for genuine point sources .",
    "this is because the source detection is usually simply accomplished from the difference in signal between the on - source position and some background position .",
    "therefore sky confusion noise due to the sky brightness fluctuations , @xmath2 , is defined as ( hb90 ; gautier et al . 1992 ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the solid angle of the measuring aperture , @xmath5 is the angular separation between the target and reference sky positions , and @xmath6 is the second order structure function , which is defined as @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sky brightness , @xmath9 is the location of the target , and @xmath10 represents the average taken over the whole map . for the configuration of two",
    "symmetrically placed reference apertures , see fig .",
    "[ fig_ref_aper ] .",
    "although the zodiacal emission is main background source in the short wavelength of far - ir range in low ecliptic latitude regions , it will not contribute to the fluctuations on the large scales because the zodiacal light is generally smooth on scales smaller than typical resolution of ir observations @xcite . from the analysis of the _ iso _ data , @xmath11brah@xmath12 m et al .",
    "searched for the brightness fluctuations in the zodiacal light at 25 @xmath1 m with 5 fields of @xmath13  0.5@xmath14  @xmath15  0.5@xmath14 at low , intermediate , and high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "they found that an upper limit to the fluctuations of 0.2 per cent of the total brightness level was estimated for an aperture of 3@xmath16 diameter .",
    "this amount of fluctuations would not cause any significant noise .",
    "therefore , the sky confusion noise is mainly related to the spatial properties of the cirrus . in many cases ,",
    "the power spectrum of the dust emission can be expressed as a simple power - law .",
    "using the _ iras _ data at 100 @xmath1 m , gautier et al .",
    "computed the power spectrum @xmath17 of the spatial fluctuations of cirrus emission as a function of spatial frequency @xmath18 , for angles between 4@xmath16 and 400@xmath16 .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the angular scale corresponding angular frequency ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the subscript 0 on @xmath18 and @xmath20 denotes a reference scale , @xmath22 is the powers at @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the index of the power spectrum .",
    "since the second order structure function is proportional to power spectrum representing the spatial structure of cirrus , the sky confusion noise @xmath25 on a scale @xmath20 corresponding to the width of the measurement aperture scales as : @xmath26 hb90 extended the work by gautier et al . at @xmath27 m in order to estimate the sky confusion at all wavelengths , using the empirical relationship , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in gautier et al . .",
    "they found an approximation for the cirrus confusion noise as follows ( hereafter hb90 formula ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant , @xmath32 the wavelength of the measurement , @xmath33 the diameter of the telescope , and @xmath34 is the mean brightness at the observation wavelength .",
    "they set the constant @xmath31 to be 0.3 .",
    "this indicates that the sky confusion depends upon both the variation of the surface brightness in the background structure and the resolution of the telescope .",
    "consequently , the noise becomes less significant for larger aperture sizes .",
    "in order to investigate the sky confusion for the present and upcoming infrared space missions with a high resolution , we need the information on the behavior of cirrus emission in very small scales .",
    "since observationally available data have rather low resolution , we need to add high resolution component . in this section , we describe the method of extending the low resolution data to high resolution . for the observational low resolution data , we used the all - sky 100 @xmath1 m dust map generated from the _ iras _ and _ cobe _ data by schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( 1998 ; hereafter sfd98 ) .",
    "[ fig_mps_sfd98 ] shows the measured power spectrum in the dust maps of sfd98 at a galactic latitude of @xmath35 degrees .",
    "these power spectra are well fitted to power laws of index -2.9 .",
    "however , the power drops at higher frequencies corresponding to the map resolution of @xmath13 6.1 arcmin .",
    "this breakdown of the power spectrum is due to the large beam size of iras map .",
    "although we can recover the small - scale fluctuation by the deconvolution of a point spread function ( psf ) , there is clearly some limitation . we need to generate the dust map including the contributions from small - scale fluctuations in order to study for the planned present and future missions with high resolution ( @xmath36  1 arcmin ) .",
    "we obtain such high resolution map by adding small - scale structure of cirrus emission to the low - resolution map of sfd98 assuming that the small - scale fluctuations also follow the estimated power spectrum with the same power - law index , as described above .",
    "the power , @xmath37 , is defined as the variance of the amplitude in the fluctuations : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the perturbation field , @xmath40 is the variance of the fluctuation and @xmath41 is the correlation function of the brightness field .",
    "we assume that the distribution of fluctuations is approximated as a random gaussian process where the fourier components @xmath39 have random phases so that the statistical properties of distribution are fully described by the power spectrum @xmath42 @xcite . in this case",
    ", we can set each fluctuation within a finite grid in the frequency domain by a random gaussian process of the amplitude of each fluctuation considering the realization of a volume for the sample embedded within a larger finite volume @xcite .",
    "we assign fourier amplitudes randomly within the above distribution in the finite volume and assign phases randomly between 0 and 2@xmath43 . since the field used in this simulation is small ( @xmath36 10 degree ) , we can take the small - angle approximation and treat the patch of sky as flat @xcite . in the flat sky approximation",
    ", we obtain the power spectrum and generate a patch of the dust map in cartesian coordinates .",
    "we generate a realistic distribution of the galactic emission in the following manner .",
    "the basic data for the information of the large - scale structure are obtained from the low resolution all - sky map by sfd98 .",
    "we add the simulated small - scale structure to these basic data in the fourier domain , where the power spectrum of the small - scale structure follows that of the large - scale structure .",

    "the lower panel shows the profiles for selected areas of two images ( upper - left and upper - middle panels ) .",
    "we find in this simulation that the emission including the high resolution , small - scale component ( above the resolution of the dust map by sfd98 to a resolution of 4 arcsec ) reflects the trend of the large - scale emission ( above the resolution of sfd98 dust map ) .",
    "we obtain a patch of the dust map including small - scale fluctuations by summing the large - scale component of sfd98 map and the small - scale component of the simulated emission in the fourier domain . according to this scheme of fourier power spectrum analysis ,",
    "the cutoff spatial frequency of the dust map by sfd98 is set to the nyquist limit , i.e. a half of the spatial frequency corresponding to the resolution of the dust map by sfd98 .",
    "we use the power spectrum fitted below the nyquist sampling limit in order to extend the power spectrum to higher spatial frequencies .",
    "typically , the 2d power spectrum of a sfd98 dust map patch shows the presence of a cross along spatial frequencies of @xmath9 and @xmath44 axis if we assume that the centre in the spatial domain is regarded as the spatial frequency 0 .",
    "this cross is caused by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm that makes an `` infinite pavement '' with the image prior to computing the fourier transform @xcite . in order to preserve the information of the emission at the edges , we directly use the power at the spatial frequencies of @xmath9 and @xmath44 axis , and extrapolate the power at other spatial frequencies ( above the cutoff spatial frequency ) according to the estimated power spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig_dmap_gb50 ] , we show a patch of the dust map by sfd98 at a galactic latitude of 50 degree ( upper left ) , a patch regenerated by extending the power spectrum ( upper right ) and the estimated power spectrum ( lower panel ) .      assuming that the spatial structure of the dust emission is independent of wavelength , we can obtain the dust map at other wavelengths than 100 @xmath1 m by applying an appropriate model for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . since the dust particles are small ( @xmath36 0.25 @xmath1 m ) compared with far - ir wavelengths , the opacity does not depend upon the details of the particle size distribution , but on the nature of the emitting material itself . in the far - ir , the opacity @xmath45 generally follows a power law : @xmath46 with frequency @xmath47 .",

    ".    the hb90 formula was obtained from the analysis of the low resolution _ iras _ data at 100 @xmath1 m and assumed a constant power index for the cirrus power spectrum . in the case of the high resolution missions , since the sky confusion becomes sensitive to the local structure rather than the large scale structure , the calculation of the sky confusion strongly depends upon the power spectrum estimated for each patch and the power at the scale length corresponding to the resolution of the detector .",
    "therefore , we should consider carefully the combination of the resolution and the power spectrum of the cirrus in the estimation of the sky confusion noise .",
    "in addition , the larger discrepancy in the bright regions for the _ astro - f _ mission compared to the prediction from _ iso _ observations can be explained by an increase in the spatial resolution , although the aperture sizes of two telescopes are similar ( see the specifications of the two space missions in table [ tab_inst_para ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the sky confusion level predicted by the _ iras _ data from which hb90 formula are derived is significantly overestimated in the case of the higher resolution missions .",
    "generally the most important component superimposed on the extragalactic background in the far - ir is the cirrus emission .",
    "however , at high spatial frequencies the cosmic far - ir background ( cfirb ) fluctuations may become dominant @xcite .",
    "therefore , in any estimation of the sky confusion noise using observational data in the dark fields should consider the fluctuation due to the cfirb . by fitting the sky confusion noise over the mean sky brightness , kiss et al .",
    "obtained cfirb fluctuation of 7 @xmath87 2 mjy at 90 @xmath1 m and 15 @xmath87 4 mjy at 170 @xmath1 m . after correcting for the contribution of the cfirb in the estimation of the sky confusion noise , we obtained results similar with those of kiss et al . in the dark fields",
    "( see the symbol in circle with arrow in fig .",

    "since the cfirb fluctuations strongly depend upon the extragalactic source count model , we will discuss this issue in greater detail in our forthcoming paper [ jeong et al .",
    "2004c , in preparation ] .",
    "kiss et al . analyzed the dependency of the sky confusion noise on other separations by the simple power expression from _ iso _ observational data : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is a constant for a specific map .",
    "we obtained @xmath105 s for all patches and showed @xmath105 as a function of mean brightness for each mission as given in fig .",
    "[ fig_dep_sep ] .",
    "as the sky becomes brighter , @xmath105 becomes larger due to the prominent structure of the cirrus emission .",
    "kiss et al . obtained a much lower @xmath105 in dark regions , but their values of @xmath105 in other regions are similar to our results .",
    "this result can be explained by two possible effects : one is that the cirrus structure observed by _",
    "iso _ is blurred by the instrumental noise in most of the dark regions and the other is that many extragalactic point sources below the detection limit , i.e. cfirb fluctuations , can remove the cirrus structure . if we only consider the component due to the cirrus in the dark fields , the values of @xmath105 in the dark regions by kiss et al .",
    "are similar to our results . in most of the bright regions ,",
    "the scatter of @xmath105 shows the similar trend and this is probably caused by the relatively large difference in the spatial structure in each region . in the same mean brightness , @xmath105 s in sw band are larger than those in lw band because spatial structures should be prominent in sw band .",
    "in addition , since we use the simulated data , changing features of @xmath105 in two wavelength have a similar shape . for the _ herschel _ and _ spica _ missions , our estimations show that @xmath105 slowly increases and the error decreases compared with other missions , because of the much higher resolution than the other missions considered .      in this study , we assume that the structure of cirrus is independent of wavelength . however , recent papers reported on enhanced dust emissivity at some medium - to - high density clouds in lw band of far - ir due to the presence of a cold dust component ( t @xmath106 15k ) @xcite .",
    "this result imply that the cirrus structure can be changed in lw band .",
    "kiss et al .",
    "suggested that the power index of the power spectrum also depends upon both wavelength and surface brightness due to the coexistence of dust components with various temperatures within the same field and cold extended emission features ( usually , @xmath107 ) . using the assumption that the sky confusion noise is proportional to the scale length ( see equation [ eqn_rel_strps ] ) , we can estimate the sky confusion for different power indices .",
    "the ratio @xmath108 of the sky confusion noise with the power index of @xmath109 to that with the power index of @xmath24 can be defined as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the contribution to the power index from any other structure in the power spectrum . in this calculation , we fix the power at the scale length of the resolution limit of the map ( @xmath13 6.1 arcmin ) and wavelength at 100 @xmath1 m from the assumption that the power over this scale is not affected by the extra components proposed by kiss et al . .",
    "table [ tab_scaled_strn ] lists the ratio of the sky confusion noise for the different power indices for each space mission covering power indices of the power spectrum on the cirrus emission .",
    "since the fluctuation at smaller scales is more sensitive to the power index , the sky confusion noise is much more dependent upon the power index for the space missions with higher resolutions .",
    "as seen in table [ tab_prop_patch ] , our estimated power indices in the bright regions ( @xmath24 @xmath112 3.3 ) are somewhat higher than those in low density regions ( @xmath24 @xmath36 2.8 ) . from the recent _ spitzer _ observation , ingalls et al .",

    "the source confusion caused by the overlapping of adjacent sources mainly depends upon the source distribution and the beam profile @xcite .",
    "source confusion becomes important as the observation sensitivity increases since there are usually more faint sources than brighter ones .",
    "currently favorable source count models require strong evolution in order to fit the _ iso _ data from mid- to far - ir , the scuba data at sub - mm wavelengths , and the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) at 170 @xmath1 m @xcite . in our study",

[ fig_source_dist ] ) , in order to derive an accurate value for the sky confusion limits without source confusion effect . since the sky confusion noises in the sw bands are much lower than those in the lw bands , we set different normalization constants and minimum flux values @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath119 = 0.001 mjy and @xmath123 = 3 in the sw band , @xmath124 = 0.1 mjy and @xmath123 = 10 in the lw band , where @xmath118 is set to be 100 mjy ( see fig .",
