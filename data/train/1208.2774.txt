    "since hosono and coworkers discovered superconductivity in hole - doped lafeaso at @xmath5=26 k,@xcite fe - pnictides have been the cause of much excitement.@xcite the mechanism of the superconductivity has yet to be uncovered , but many have discussed the nesting of two fermi surfaces at the @xmath8 and @xmath11 points.@xcite however , some experimental and theoretical investigations of a few superconducting fe - pnictides have shown the absence of a nested fermiology , though these compounds are expected to share a common mechanism of the superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    in the pnictide family , the recently synthesized 21322 systems sr@xmath0@xmath12o@xmath3fe@xmath13 ( @xmath12=transition metal , and @xmath13=p or as ) , with a thick perovskite - like spacer between fe@xmath14 layers , have stimulated a great enthusiasm due to its possible bimetallic character as well as its high two - dimensionality.@xcite sato _ et al .",
    "_ synthesized a member of the 21311 system sr@xmath0(mg@xmath1ti@xmath2)o@xmath3feas   in the range of @xmath4.@xcite with 50% mg doping of the ti sites ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6=0.5 ) , the superconductivity appears at @xmath5= 10 k , but with a small superconducting volume fraction , which thus implies that there is no intrinsic superconductivity . on reducing the mg concentration",
    ", @xmath5 increases sharply to @xmath15 34 k at @xmath16 , and reaches a maximum @xmath15 40 k at @xmath6=0.2 , slightly higher than that in a stoichiometric sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas . throughout all of the doping range",
    "considered , no significant changes in the lattice constants were observed .",
    "although synthesis of a sample below @xmath6=0.2 has not been successful yet , the ti rich phase may be expected to have a higher @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the ti ions play a crucial role in the superconductivity of this system .    from the viewpoint of formal charge , the @xmath6=0.5 phase ( _ i.e. _ , 50% mg doping ) consists of tetravalent",
    "ti ions of @xmath17 , leading to a wholly insulating block between feas layers . replacing a fraction of the sites containing mg ions with ti ions ,",
    "ti@xmath18 ion becomes metallic @xmath19 ti@xmath20 on the average .",
    "thus , this system is a good example for investigating the effects of metallic and insulating spacers on the superconductivity .",
    "the effects of a metallic spacer have been under debate for sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas   having v ( @xmath21 ) layers.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the @xmath6=0.5 and 0 phases , which represent either pure insulating or metallic spacers , respectively .",
    "so far , no evidence of magnetic ordering has been reported in this compound .",
    "we therefore will focus on the electronic structures and fermi surfaces of the nonmagnetic ( nm ) state , though possible magnetic tendencies will also be discussed briefly .",
    "in our calculations , based on the tetragonal unit cell with @xmath22 space group , the experimentally measured lattice constants @xmath23=3.935    and @xmath24=15.952    were used , resulting in a slightly larger volume by 2% than in sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas.@xcite in the cell , fe atoms lie at @xmath25 sites ( @xmath26,@xmath27,0 ) , ti / mg , sr , as , and o atoms lie at @xmath28 sites ( @xmath26,@xmath26,@xmath29 ) , and another o atoms sit at the @xmath30 sites ( @xmath26,@xmath27,@xmath29 ) . using the local density approximation ( lda ) , the internal parameters were optimized to 0.3072 for ti , 0.8210 and 0.5898 for two sr sites , 0.0772 for as , 0.4270 for o at @xmath28 sites , and 0.2939 for o at @xmath30 sites .",
    "these values lead to the as - fe - as bond angle of @xmath31=116@xmath32 , which is measured in one side of the fe layer , corresponding to @xmath725 in the literature.@xcite this significant difference from @xmath740 k suggests a crucial role of the sr@xmath0@xmath33o@xmath3 layer .",
    "the mg - rich phase sr@xmath0ti@xmath34mg@xmath34o@xmath3feas   was understood with a @xmath35 supercell using our optimized internal parameters . in these optimization processes ,",
    "the residual hellman - feynman forces on the atoms were lower than 1 mev /  .    in all calculations ,",
    "the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) implemented in the accurate all - electron full - potential local orbital code , fplo , was used.@xcite a regular mesh containing 196 @xmath36 points in the irreducible wedge was used to sample the brillouin zone .",
    "the magnetic tendencies in the @xmath6=0 phase were studied using the fixed spin moment ( fsm ) method,@xcite with a much denser mesh of up to 726 irreducible @xmath36 points .",
    "first , we will address the electronic structure of the @xmath6=0.5 phase having the insulating spacer .",
    "figure [ band21 ] displays the enlarged band structure with the fatband of the ti @xmath37 manifold ( top panel ) and the fatband of the fe @xmath38 manifold ( bottom panel ) .",
    "note that the @xmath39 and @xmath11 points in the unit cell are folded into the @xmath8 and @xmath39 points in the @xmath40 supercell , respectively .",
    "the corresponding dos near the fermi energy @xmath41 is given in fig .",
    "[ dos21 ] .",
    "as expected , in the @xmath6=0.5 phase , the @xmath42 orbitals of the ti ions are completely unoccupied .",
    "the ti @xmath37 manifold expands from 0.5 ev to 2 ev . in this phase ,",
    "the details near @xmath41 are very similar to those observed for other superconducting fe - pnictides.@xcite at the @xmath8 point , three hole pockets derived from the fe @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 bands appear , while two - fold @xmath11-centered electron pockets with the character of these three bands also appear .",
    "considering that there is no intrinsic superconductivity at this phase and the similar fermiology with other superconducting fe pnictides , the nesting effects may not be a necessary ingredient for fe pnictides to be superconductors .",
    "now , we will focus on the @xmath6=0 phase , which contains only the metallic @xmath46 ti@xmath47 ions .",
    "thus , this represents the phase of the range of @xmath48 , consisting of metallic spacers . in this subsection",
    ", we will address the electronic structure of the nm state .",
    "the enlarged band structure near @xmath41 and the fatband of the ti @xmath37 manifold are displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "the incomplete tio@xmath49as octahedron results in a breaking of the symmetry of the @xmath37 manifold .",
    "the partially filled ti @xmath50 band spreads over the range of 0.7 to 1.6 ev ( here , @xmath41 is set to zero ) , which is a width that is 15% larger than that of the v @xmath50 band in sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas.@xcite this band can be described by a single - band tight - binding model with nearest neighbor hopping of @xmath51=0.28 ev and next neighbor hopping of @xmath52=0.08 ev , _",
    "i.e. _ , values that are about 15% larger than in sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas.@xcite the other bands of ti are mostly unoccupied , but there is some @xmath41 crossing in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands near the @xmath8 point , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "although the hybridization of feas layers and the intervening ti layers is negligible in almost the whole regime due to high two - dimensionality , small mixing with fe @xmath45 and @xmath44 leads to this @xmath41 crossing ( see below ) .    compared with other superconducting fe - pnictides , @xcite the bands having fe character , as displayed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ band ] , show both similarities and remarkable distinctions . similar to other superconducting fe pnictides ,",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands lead to electron pockets at the @xmath11 point .",
    "however , instead of three fe - derived hole pockets at the @xmath8 point , only one fe @xmath45-derived hole pocket appears , but this is considerably shrunk in this system compared to other fe - pnictides ( see below ) .",
    "this may imply that the role of fe for the superconductivity is substantially reduced in this phase .",
    "most of the fe bands are separated from the ti - derived bands , reflecting strong two - dimensionality .",
    "exceptions occur around the @xmath11-point and near the @xmath8 point , near @xmath41 . near the @xmath8 point",
    ", the fe and ti @xmath45 bands are hybridized with each other , leading to a 0.1 ev gap at @xmath41 . on the other hand , around the @xmath11 point ,",
    "the ti @xmath45 are more strongly hybridized with the fe @xmath45 and @xmath44 , with the gap of 0.6 ev that occurs above @xmath41 , resulting in surviving @xmath11-centered electron pockets .",
    "this difference to sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas   results from the different @xmath38-orbital filling between v and ti ions in these systems : namely @xmath21 for v@xmath47 and @xmath46 for ti@xmath47 .    as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ band ] , noticeable features appear close to @xmath41 . at the @xmath8 point ,",
    "two - fold bands at 40 mev and 58 mev , and a single band at 30 mev appear .",
    "one of the two - fold valence bands is dispersionless near the @xmath8 point along the @xmath8@xmath39 line , leading to a van hove singularity at -40 mev . on the other hand , one of the doublet conduction bands almost touches with @xmath41 along the @xmath8@xmath39 line , leading to a van hove singularity almost exactly at @xmath41 .",
    "additionally , one band lying on @xmath41 appears along the @xmath11@xmath8 line ( actually a few mev above @xmath41 ) .",
    "these features are reflected in the total and atom - projected densities of states ( emphasized near @xmath41 ) , given in fig .",
    "a valley appears at -20 mev between the two van hove singularities at -40 mev and @xmath41 , indicating sensitivity to hole ( or electron ) doping .",
    "this may imply that the stoichiometric sample is near to the optimal doping .",
    "@xmath53 is twice as large than for most other fe pnictides due to the greater contribution of ti , but is only two thirds of that found in sr@xmath0vo@xmath3feas.@xcite remarkably , except for the ti contribution , the magnitude of @xmath53 is similar with that of lafeaso .",
    "it is interesting that the @xmath5 of hole - doped lafeaso is comparable with the @xmath54 system described herein , in which ti ions are insulating .",
    "this fact suggests that metallic ti ions can play an important role in the superconductivity of this system .      the fermi surfaces ( fss ) consist of five @xmath8- and two @xmath11-centered pockets , as illustrated in fig .",
    "three large @xmath8-centered electron pockets have ti character and the others have fe character , derived from the @xmath45 band .",
    "the character of the @xmath11-centered fss is mostly derived from the @xmath45 and @xmath44 bands and partially from the @xmath43 bands .",
    "the @xmath11-centered electron pockets possess the shape of an elliptical cylinder ( in fig . [ fs](a ) ) and a rhombus ( in fig .",
    "[ fs](b ) ) . in the regime between the two fe - derived @xmath8-centered",
    "fss , electrons reside in a coaxial distorted rectangular box - like shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fs](d ) ) .",
    "a fe - derived @xmath8-centered hole pocket is considered to be a crucial ingredient for the formation of pairings in fe pnictides , but in this system the pocket is shrunk considerably , implying the opposing view that the metallic ti ions have a more important role .",
    "the three @xmath8-centered electron pockets are derived from ti @xmath50 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , see figs .",
    "[ fs](a ) to ( c ) .",
    "the first two fss , which are of similar size , are much like mgb@xmath0 .",
    "a large portion of the fss has remarkably low fermi velocity @xmath55 , with the lowest being @xmath56 cm / s .",
    "in particular , throughout the @xmath11-centered elliptical cylinder and the @xmath8-centered concentric fe - derived fss , @xmath55 is close to its lowest value . for the ti - derived @xmath8-centered fss",
    ", @xmath55 is quite low along the @xmath57 line for the two similar sized fss and along the @xmath58 line in the remaining fs given in fig . [",
    "fs](c ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we will address briefly the possible magnetic tendencies in the mg - free phase .",
    "the competition between superconductivity and magnetic ordering widely observed in fe pnictides is unclear for this compound , since no magnetic ordering has been observed .",
    "allowing for a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , fm has an energy that is a little lower by 5 mev / fe than for nm .",
    "the total magnetic moment is 0.46 @xmath59/fe , mostly comprised of contributions from the ti ions ( 0.37 @xmath59 ) .",
    "the fe ions are nearly nonmagnetic , less than 0.1 @xmath59,@xcite suggesting that the magnetic fluctuation due to ti ions is of more importance than that due to the fe ions in this phase .",
    "the fixed spin moment ( fsm ) method was employed to investigate this magnetic behavior , using a cell that allows only fm and nm states . as obtained from lsda calculations",
    ", fsm shows the minimum energy at a total fixed moment of @xmath11=0.45 @xmath59/fe , with an energy 6 mev / fe lower than in the nm state . from @xmath11=0 to around the minimum energy state , the fe moment is quite small and most of the contribution to @xmath11 results from the ti moment .",
    "after the minimum energy is reached , the moment of fe increases monotonically , coinciding with a sharp increment in energy with a slope of @xmath15 220 mev/@xmath11 ( @xmath11 : total moment per formula unit ) , while that of ti stays at around 0.6(@xmath600.05 ) @xmath59 .",
    "the stoner @xmath61 is 0.47 ev , so @xmath62=2.2 with @xmath53=4.6 states per ev per formula unit obtained from the fm calculations , indicating strong magnetic instability .",
    "for the @xmath6=0 phase , the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath63 to ti ions was applied using both popular double - counting schemes in the lda+u approach,@xcite to investigate whether or not a mott transition in the @xmath46 ti@xmath47 ions occurs . up to @xmath63=7 ev @xmath15 @xmath64 , which is a much larger value than what has been used in perovskite @xmath65tio@xmath3 ( @xmath65=rare earth elements),@xcite the sr@xmath0tio@xmath3 layers are still metallic .",
    "this failure of lda+u has previously been observed in some @xmath66 or @xmath67 systems , in which no integer occupation number can occur due to strong @xmath68-@xmath38 hybridization , since an integer occupation is required to lead to a mott transition by the lda+u method.@xcite in this system , the calculated occupation number is significantly larger than the formal number @xmath46 , resulting from the absence of rigorous definition of oxidation state in solids , as recently discussed.@xcite this may prevent the lda+u approach from driving a mott transition.@xcite    in summary , we addressed the electronic structure of sr@xmath0(mg@xmath1ti@xmath2)o@xmath3feas   for the @xmath6=0.5 and @xmath6=0 phases , which represent insulating and metallic ti layers , respectively . at @xmath6=0.5 , which shows no intrinsic superconductivity ,",
    "the fermiology is just like that for other fe - pnictides . introducing metallic ti ions ,",
    "the @xmath8-centered fe - derived fss are reduced considerably or disappeared",
    ". instead , three @xmath8-centered ti fss appear , and two of them have similar sizes like in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "our fsm calculations further suggest possible magnetic ordering in the ti ions .",
    "although no magnetic ordering has been observed in this compound , the high temperature resistivity measurement shows a kink for samples below @xmath6=0.5 at @xmath69 k,@xcite thus implying magnetic transition .",
    "consequently , a detailed magnetic measurement is required for this compound .",
