    "( [ dim-8 ] ) is  @xcite : @xmath15 moreover , loops with virtual graviton exchanges can generate even 6-dimensional four - fermion interactions similar to the ci in eq .",

    "one example is the axial - axial operator : @xmath16 with @xmath17    the current experimental lower bounds on the mass scales in eqs .",
    "( [ ci ] ) and ( [ dim-8 ] ) , that parametrize the strength of the corresponding contactlike interactions , can be summarized qualitatively as follows  @xcite : @xmath18 ; @xmath19 [ 95% c.l . ] .",
    "clearly , constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath3 are determined by the deviations of the observables , @xmath20 , from the sm expectations .",
    "we choose as basic observables the longitudinally polarized differential cross sections , @xmath21 , for the fermionic processes @xmath0 at ilc ( @xmath22 is limited to @xmath23 ) .",
    "obviously , the theoretical expressions of the cross sections including the novel physics ( np ) , to be compared to the data , are given by @xmath24 , where @xmath14 generically denotes @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "it has been strongly emphasized  @xcite that electron and positron beams polarization plays a crucial rle in enhancing the sensitivity to the np interactions and , indeed , this option is very seriously considered for the planned ilc .    the comparison between `` theoretical '' relative deviations , @xmath25 , and corresponding foreseen experimental relative uncertainties , @xmath26 , can be performed by a simple @xmath27 procedure combining the initial polarization configurations and the binning of the angular range for the measured reactions  @xcite : @xmath28 the @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ reldev ] ) will be a function of the mass scale @xmath14 relevant to the contactlike interaction under consideration .",
    "the expected _ discovery _ reach on an individual interaction , i.e. , the maximum value of the corresponding mass scale @xmath14 for which a deviation caused by the interaction itself could be observed , can be assessed by assuming a situation where no deviation is observed and imposing , for 95% c.l . , the constraint @xmath29 .",
    "basically , this is the way the current limits above have been obtained .    in table",
    "[ table:1 ] , we give examples of discovery reaches expected for an ilc with the `` reference '' parameters : @xmath30 tev ; time - integrated luminosity @xmath31 , and electron and positron longitudinal polarizations @xmath32 , @xmath33 . while these luminosity and beams polarization",

    "[ table:1 ] , binning of the angular range by @xmath36 intervals has been used in ( [ reldev ] ) , and the statistical uncertainties have been evaluated by the final fermions reconstruction efficiencies : 100% for electrons , 95% for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , 35% and 60% for @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks , respectively .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainties are found to originate from polarizations and luminosity , on which we have assumed the accuracies 0.1% and 0.5% , respectively .",
    "earlier determinations , demonstrating the fundamental rle of beams polarization for the discovery reaches on ci interactions , can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
