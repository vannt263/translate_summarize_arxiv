    "stable icosahedral quasicrystals occur in the compounds cd@xmath1yb and cd@xmath1ca  @xcite . in each case",
    "the phase diagram of the binary alloy contains a 1/1 cubic approximant at a close - by composition  @xcite .",
    "the cd@xmath2yb structure  @xcite can be represented in a conventional simple cubic unit cell with a lattice parameter of @xmath3   .",
    "the pearson symbol for cd@xmath2yb is ci176 indicating that it is cubic , body - centered , with 176 atomic positions per simple cubic unit cell . since 176 is not a multiple of the basic 7-atom stoichiometric unit ( 6 cd and 1 yb ) , there must be partial occupancy .",
    "in fact , the unit cell contains 144 cd atoms , 24 yb atoms and 8 vacancies .",
    "sets of 4 vacancies alternate with sets of 4 cd atoms among vertices of a cube to form tetrahedra located at the center of a dodecahedral cluster ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : struct ] ) .",
    "there are two such clusters per simple cubic cell , for a total of 8 vacancies .",

    "( right ) two alternate tetrahedral orientations ( dark = cd , light = vacancy ) according to ci176 structure  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=144 ]    the proper structure type of cd@xmath2ca has recently been debated .",
    "initial reports  @xcite assigned it to prototype cd@xmath2y with pearson symbol ci184 .",
    "this structure is equivalent to the ci176 structure of cd@xmath2yb except for the central cd@xmath5 tetrahedra . in ci184",
    "these cd atoms occupy 4 out of 12 vertices of a cuboctahedron ( resulting in 6 possible orientatons ) instead of 4 out of 8 vertices of a cube ( resulting in 2 possible orientations ) . after the discovery of stable cd - ca quasicrystals some researchers  @xcite suggested the structure type of cd@xmath2ca",
    "might actually be cd@xmath2yb.ci176 .",
    "the full story has yet to be resolved .",
    "indeed a recent study of @xmath6cd@xmath2 for a variety of metal atoms @xmath6 finds evidence for yet additional site types  @xcite .    in order for the overall structure",
    "to be truly body - centered , it is necessary that either the tetrahedra at each center be identically aligned or else that all body centers be randomly oriented . in each case",
    "a body - center translation leaves the structure invariant .",
    "however , recent experiments indicate order - disorder transitions in which a supercell ordering develops at low temperatures , breaking the body - centered cubic symmetry  @xcite .",
    "estimated transition entropies close to @xmath7 suggest that the cluster center tetrahedra have two equivalent orientations .",
    "both should occur randomly at high temperatures , and freeze into some definite ordered pattern at low temperatures .",
    "such a local two - state system can be modeled using the ising model , with the two spin states representing the two cluster orientations . because the ci176 structure of cd@xmath2yb possesses precisely two tetrahedron orientations , we began our initial study of the order - disorder transition using this structure .",
    "we carry out _ ab - initio _ calculations using the plane - wave program vasp  @xcite which yields reasonably accurate total energies .",
    "this approach uses ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite or paw potentials  @xcite to represent the effective interaction of valence electrons with ionic cores , and solves the many - body quantum mechanical band structure of these electrons using electronic density functional theory .",
    "we choose to model cd - ca rather than cd - yb because the alkali earth element ca is easier to treat from first principles than the rare earth element yb .",
    "first , we use vasp to reproduce the sequence of low - temperature stable phases in the established ca - cd binary phase diagram  @xcite . to do this",
    "we calculate the cohesive energy for each known structure , and several hypothetical ones .",
    "each structure is fully relaxed in both unit cell parameters and atomic coordinates .",
    "all energies are converged to an accuracy of 1 mev / atom or better by increasing the k - point mesh density .",
    "these calculations use paw potentials in the generalized gradient approximation and a constant plane - wave energy cutoff of 274 ev .    subtracting each cohesive energy from the tie - line joining the pure elements in their ground states yields enthalpies of formation ( at t=0k ) .",
    "enthalpies of all known and many hypothetical ca - cd structures are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdiag ] .",
    "we label each structure with its name followed by its pearson symbol .",
    "agreement between our calculation and the established phase diagram requires that all known low temperature structures lie on the convex hull of enthalpy versus composition .",
    "additionally , all hypothetical structures must lie above the convex hull , as must all known high temperature , high pressure and metastable phases .",
    "agreement is perfect , except for one seeming difficulty with cacd@xmath8 which we now address .",
    "the low and high temperature cacd2 phases are reversed in energy relative to the experimental report  @xcite .",
    "however , the transition between the hp12 and oi12 variants has not been well established .",
    "most likely , according to our findings , the presumed low temperature hp12 phase is actually a metastable phase , and the nominal high temperature oi12 phase is actually stable all the way to low temperatures .",
    "the established phase diagram  @xcite lists a phase ca@xmath9cd@xmath10 , of unknown structure , which is claimed to exist from t=0k up to melting , at a composition extremely close to cacd@xmath2 .",
    "thermodynamic rules governing alloy phase diagrams suggest that either cd@xmath2ca or this unknown phase should actually be stable at high temperature only , because the probability is low that distinct phases coexist over an extended temperature range when they are close in composition .",
    "one candidate for the ca@xmath9cd@xmath10 phase ( based on atomic size ratio and chemical similarity ) is sc@xmath9zn@xmath10.ci160 .",
    "this structure differs from cacd@xmath2.ci176 because the innermost cd@xmath5 tetrahedra ( see fig .  [ fig : struct ] ) are missing .",
    "we find the energy of this structure is substantially above the convex hull , confirming that occupancy of the inner shell is energetically favorable but leaving open the question if occupancy by _ four _ cd atoms is the optimum .",
    "other candidates for the structure of the phase named ca@xmath9cd@xmath10 are the cluster of additional structures just to the left of cd@xmath2ca in fig  [ fig : pdiag ] .",
    "these are postulated icosahedral quasicrystal approximant structures based on canonical cell decorations , as discussed below .",
    "the proliferation of many distinct nearly degenerate structures , at energies slightly above the convex hull , is consistent with the proposal of entropic stabilization of quasicrystals .",
    "we conclude that the observed phase named ca@xmath9cd@xmath10 is most likely the icosahedral phase and that it is stable at high temperatures only .",
    "our ca - cd decoration models utilize tilings of canonical cells  @xcite , whose vertices form maximal - density packings of icosahedral clusters linked along 2-fold and 3-fold icosahedral directions . space is divided into 4 kinds of `` canonical cells '' , denoted a , b , c and d. our decoration rule for a , b and c cells was inferred from the refined structure of the ca@xmath11cd@xmath12.cp792 approximant  @xcite , that we identified as the `` 2/1 abc '' tiling .",
    "the resulting a - cell decoration , when applied to the `` 1/1 a '' tiling , reproduces the known @xmath6cd@xmath2 structure .",
    "the known quasicrystal approximants contain no d - cells and thus do not imply a specific decoration rule for d - cell interiors .",
    "instead we constructed some plausible variants by hand and selected the lowest energy one .",
    "our decoration rule does not impose specific orientations for the cluster center tetrahedra .",
    "the canonical cell decoration model implies decorations of prolate- and oblate - rhombahedra that are consistent with an earlier proposal  @xcite for the 1/1 cubic approximant .",
    "an advantage of the canonical cell approach is that it can be systematically extended to model higher approximants and also the icosahedral phase .",
    "several canonical cell approximants were small enough that we could perform total energy calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdiag ] ) .",
    "in addition to the cubic 1/1 approximant , these were three rhombohedral structures : ( i ) `` bc''-tiling ( ca@xmath11cd@xmath13 ) , ( ii ) `` d''-tiling ( ca@xmath4cd@xmath14 ) and ( iii ) `` or''-tiling ( ca@xmath15cd@xmath16 ) , where ca@xmath17cd@xmath18 are formulae per primitive cell . the or tiling contains all four kinds of cells ( cell content a@xmath2b@xmath9c@xmath9d ) , and its primitive cell is a golden oblate rhombohedron with edge length @xmath19 , with `` quasilattice constant '' ( penrose rhombahedron edge length ) @xmath205.7 .",
    "we turn now to the energetics of orientational ordering in the ci176 structure .",
    "consider two realizations of the ci176 structure , identical except for the orientations of the cd@xmath5 tetrahedra at cluster centers .",
    "since the tetrahedron takes two orientations , we can assign an ising - like spin variable @xmath21 to each one .",
    "assign a tetrahedron the @xmath22 sign if one of its vertices falls along the direction @xmath23 , and assign it a @xmath24 sign if instead one of its vertices falls along the direction @xmath25 .",
    "if the tetrahedron at the unit cell vertex takes the @xmath22 orientation and the cell center tetrahedron is also in the @xmath22 orientation , then the cell vertex and center are equivalent and the symmetry is body centered , hence the pearson symbol ci176 . if , on the other hand , the tetrahedron at the body center takes the @xmath24 orientation then the centering translational symmetry is broken and the stucture becomes primitive cubic ( pearson symbol cp176 ) instead of body - centered .",
    "our calculations show the antiferromagnetic @xmath26 configuration is favored . to guage the validity of this result it is important to check convergence in the density of the @xmath27-point mesh , the cutoff energy and the sensitivity to choice of pseudopotential and the density functional .",
    "table  [ tab : cubedata ] presents our study .",
    "first we vary the @xmath27-point mesh , from @xmath28 ( the @xmath29 point ) up to @xmath30 ( all monkhorst - pack meshes ) .",
    "the table presents the convergence of each structure energy separately as well as the energy difference .",
    "all other computational parameters were held fixed during these calculations : medium precision ( specifies cutoff energy 168 ev ) ; ultrasoft pseudopotential ; ceperly - alder lda ; no atomic relaxation . in the next series",
    "we hold constant the k - point density ( we use only the @xmath29 @xmath27-point for speed ) and test the convergence in precision going from low ( cutoff 126 ev ) to medium ( cutoff 168 ev ) to high ( cutoff 210 ev ) .",
    "next , continuing with medium precision and the @xmath29 point , we compare unrelaxed energies with partial relaxation ( only relaxing clusters ( a ) and ( b ) as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ) and full relaxation in which all atoms can move .",
    "the maximum displacement is 0.23     for partial relaxation and 0.30     for full relaxation , always concentrated in the innermost dodecahedral shell .",
    "specifically , those cd atoms in this shell that adjoin a cluster center vacancy see the largest relaxations .",
    ".[tab : cubedata]energy convergence studies for cacd6.ci176 @xmath31 and @xmath26 configurations , and their difference @xmath32 .",
    "all units are ev per simple cubic cell . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     fitting these energies to a two - coupling ising model yields values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ev . because @xmath35 is negative , the next - nearest interaction proves ferromagnetic , which will increase the transition temperature and also will not lead to superlattice ordering . in other words ,",
    "the ising model presented so far is rather inconsistent with the experimental findings .",
    "given that our results disagree with experiment in both superlattice ordering and transition temperature it is clear that additional study is needed , especially the study of additional tetrahedron orientations .",
    "we restricted our attention to tetrahedron orientations belonging to subsets of a basic cube ( based on the ci176 structure ) , in order to have a simple ising - model description .",
    "there are many more possible orientations . among these are the cuboctahedron of the ci184 structure , which our calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdiag ] ) already show is prefered over ci176 .",
    "a recent study of the @xmath6cd@xmath2 structure family by gomez and lidin  @xcite finds additional partially occupied sites , proposing the new pearson type cacd@xmath2.ci232 .",
    "if an order - disorder transition exists in this new structure , it will be at a lower temperature than found in our initial study because : ( 1 ) the energy differences among orientations are generally lower ; ( 2 ) the order parameter has a higher symmetry than the ising spins so there is a higher orientational entropy .",
