    "more than a decade after the discovery of the nuclear emc effect @xcite and many fine measurements @xcite of the ratios of structure functions of nuclei and the deuteron , no consensus has been reached on the origin of the effect .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the effect , while non - trivial , is rather smooth and has the same basic shape for all nuclei , making it is easy to fit in a wide range of models with very different underlying assumptions .",
    "the only extra constraint available so far comes for measurements of the @xmath2-dependence of the sea distribution , which restricts some of the models , but is still not sufficient to allow one to unambiguously identify the origin of the emc effect .",
    "in order to move beyond this rather unsatisfactory situation , new experiments involving more kinematical variables accessible to accurate measurements are necessary .",
    "the aim of this study is to demonstrate that use of semi - inclusive processes off the deuteron , @xmath3 where a nucleon is detected in the target deuteron fragmentation region , may help to discriminate between some classes of models . in particular",
    ", one may be able to distinguish between models in which the effect arises entirely from hadronic degrees of freedom  nucleons and pions ( which in the traditional nuclear physics picture are responsible for the binding of the nucleus ) , and models in which the effect is attributed to the explicit deformation of the wave function of the bound nucleon itself . by selecting recoil nucleons with small transverse momentum in the backward region , effects due to final state interactions ( fsi ) can be minimized , thus allowing one to probe , within the impulse approximation , the deformation of the structure of the bound nucleon .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that measurement of the reaction ( [ ed ] ) in the kinematics of interest will become feasible in the near future , for example at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "recent development of silicon detectors also make it possible in the jet target experiments to measure recoil nucleons with a low momentum threshold of about 100150 mev / c .",
    "plans to implement such a technique are under discussion at the hermes detector at hera @xcite .    aside from providing insight into the origin of the nuclear emc effect per se",
    ", the measurements of tagged events may also be useful in connection with the problem of extracting the neutron structure function from deuteron data . by selecting only the slowest",
    "recoil protons in the target fragmentation region , one should be able to isolate the situation whereby the virtual photon scatters from a nearly on - shell neutron in the deuteron . in this way",
    "one may hope to extract the @xmath4 structure function while minimizing uncertainties arising from modeling the nuclear effects in the deuteron .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the basic formalism for semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering off the deuteron , and discuss the conditions under which the impulse approximation may be valid .",
    "section iii is devoted to a survey of several models whose predictions for the ratios of tagged structure functions are compared .",
    "possibilities of extracting the neutron structure function from semi - inclusive experiments are discussed in section iv , and finally some conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "it was observed a long time ago that the nuclear emc effect for the deviation from unity of the ratio @xmath5 is approximately proportional to the nuclear density .",
    "this is natural for a dilute system , and indicates that most of the emc effect is due to two - nucleon interactions .",
    "based on this observation one should expect that the emc effect in the deuteron is much smaller than that in heavy nuclei .",
    "however , by virtue of the uncertainty principle , one may try to enhance the effect by isolating the configuration where the two nucleons in the deuteron are close together .",
    "for example , it is easy to check that the main contributions to the deuteron wave function for nucleon momenta @xmath6 mev / c come from distances @xmath7  fm .    to make our discussion quantitative ,",
    "let us begin by writing the electromagnetic tensor @xmath8 of the deuteron in terms of the matrix element of the electromagnetic current : @xmath9 the tensor @xmath8 can be expanded in terms of four possible lorentz structures , with the coefficients given by the invariant structure functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 transverse , @xmath13 longitudinal ) .",
    "these functions can in general depend on four variables , constructed from the four - momenta of the target deuteron ( @xmath14 ) , virtual photon ( @xmath15 ) and spectator nucleon ( @xmath16 ) ( or equivalently the momentum of the struck nucleon @xmath17 , where @xmath18 in the deuteron rest frame ) . in terms of the invariant structure functions",
    "the differential cross section for the semi - inclusive reaction @xmath0 can then be written : @xmath19 , \\label{e3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the structure functions are related to the components of the electromagnetic tensor @xmath8 by :    [ e4 ] @xmath20    the kinematic variables in eqs.([e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the energy of virtual photon in the target rest frame and @xmath23 the nucleon mass , @xmath24 is the squared four - momentum transfer to the target , @xmath25 is the beam energy and @xmath26 .",
    "the angle @xmath27 is the azimuthal angle for the spectator nucleon , and @xmath28 the spectator nucleon energy , and @xmath29 in eqs.([e4 ] ) .",
    "we define the photon three - momentum @xmath30 to be in the @xmath31 direction .",
    "a convenient choice of the four independent variables for the structure functions is the two inclusive deep - inelastic scattering variables , @xmath1 and @xmath32 , and the transverse momentum , @xmath33 , and light - cone momentum fraction , @xmath34 , of the spectator nucleon : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the longitudinal momentum of the detected nucleon ( to simplify the expressions we have neglected here the deuteron binding energy , @xmath37 ) . in the bjorken limit",
    "the variable @xmath34 then satisfies the condition @xcite : @xmath38    having defined the relevant cross sections , we must now establish the kinematical range in which the nuclear modifications of the bound nucleon structure function will be accessible experimentally . from eqs.([e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) the restrictions :    [ e5 ] @xmath39    enhance the contribution of the longitudinal structure function @xmath40 , which is expressed through the `` good '' component of the electromagnetic current , eq.([flgood ] )",
    ". another simplification can be achieved by considering the situation where the detected nucleon in the deuteron is in the spectator kinematics , namely : @xmath41 in this kinematical region the contribution of the direct process where a nucleon is produced at the @xmath42 interaction vertex is negligible @xcite .",
    "in formulating deep - inelastic scattering from the deuteron the simplest approach adopted has been the impulse approximation for the nuclear system .",
    "we will consider two formulations of the impulse approximation : one based on the covariant feynman , or instant - form , approach , where one nucleon is on - mass - shell and one off - mass - shell , and the non - covariant / hamiltonian light - cone approach , in which both nucleons are on - mass - shell ( but off the light - cone energy shell ) . in the next subsection we shall consider corrections to the impulse approximation , in the form of final state interactions , but for now let us review briefly the basic impulse approximation assumptions and results .      in order to construct covariant amplitudes in the instant - form of quantization , summation over all possible time - orderings of intermediate states",
    "is essential .",
    "incorporation of negative energy configurations into the total lorentz - invariant amplitude is done on the basis of introducing intermediate state particles which are off their mass shells . in the impulse approximation for the scattering of a virtual photon , @xmath43 , from the deuteron",
    ", the invariant amplitude for the complete process factorizes into a product of amplitudes for @xmath43off - mass - shell nucleon scattering , and for forward nucleon ",
    "deuteron scattering . in this case",
    "the hadronic tensor of the deuteron can be written @xcite : @xmath44 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nucleon ",
    "deuteron scattering amplitude @xmath45 ( for spin - averaged processes ) contains scalar and vector components : @xmath46 the operator @xmath47 in eq.([dia ] ) is the truncated hadronic tensor for the off - shell nucleon , which describes the @xmath42 interaction . because @xmath47 is a matrix in both lorentz and dirac spaces , its structure is necessarily more general than that for a free nucleon . in the bjorken limit",
    ", it was shown in ref.@xcite that out of a possible 13 , only three independent structures contribute : @xmath48 note that the full expression for @xmath49 contains both positive and negative energy pieces .",
    "the on - shell nucleon tensor is obtained from @xmath49 by projecting out the positive energy components :    @xmath50                                                          \\\\ & = & - \\left ( g_{\\mu\\nu } + { q_{\\mu } q_{\\nu } \\over q^2 } \\right ) \\left ( m \\widehat w_0       + m^2 \\widehat w_1       + p\\cdot q \\widehat w_2 \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the functions @xmath51 here are evaluated at their on - shell points .    in terms of the off - shell truncated functions @xmath51 the deuteron tensor",
    "can then be written : @xmath52 so that in general the right - hand - side does not factorize into a single term with separate nuclear and nucleon components . as explained in ref.@xcite , factorization can be recovered by projecting from @xmath53 only the positive energy ( on - shell ) components , in which case : @xmath54 this proportionality can also be obtained by taking the non - relativistic limit for the @xmath55 amplitudes to order @xmath56 @xcite , since all negative energy contributions enter at higher orders @xcite . for the relativistic @xmath57 interaction ,",
    "the negative energy components enter through the @xmath14-state wave functions of the deuteron .",
    "however , in most realistic calculations of these , in the context of relativistic meson - exchange models of the deuteron @xcite , the contribution of the @xmath14-state wave functions is only a fraction of a percent , and so long as one avoids regions of extreme kinematics which are sensitive to the very large momentum components of the deuteron wave function , dropping the negative energy components is a reasonable approximation .",
    "indeed , the explicit calculations of the inclusive structure function of the deuteron with relativistic wave functions shows that the factorization - breaking corrections amount to @xmath58 12% for all values of @xmath59 @xcite .    finally , given these approximations one can write the deuteron hadronic tensor as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the nucleon spectral function within the instant - form impulse approximation @xcite : @xmath62 to ensure baryon number conservation @xcite . note that the approximation for the spectral function in eq.([sif ] ) is valid only for non - relativistic momenta , and for large momenta the full ( non - convolution ) expression for the hadronic tensor in ref.@xcite should be used .",
    "the effective nucleon hadronic tensor @xmath63 is defined as : @xmath64 where the effective nucleon structure function @xmath65 is now a function of the momentum fraction @xmath66 and the virtuality @xmath67 of the bound nucleon , as well as @xmath32 .",
    "the kinematics of the spectator process gives rise to the relation : @xmath68 using which one can equivalently express @xmath65 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath69 of the interacting nucleon , rather than @xmath67 .      in the light - cone formalism",
    "one can formally avoid the problems associated with negative energy solutions in eq.([woff ] ) , however , to obtain eq.([ia ] ) one must on the other hand consider contributions arising from instantaneous interactions @xcite . to take these effects into account one",
    "has to use gauge invariance to express the contribution of the `` bad '' current components of the electromagnetic tensor through the `` good '' components : @xmath70 and include the contribution of the instantaneous exchanges using the prescription of brodsky and lepage @xcite . in the approximation",
    "when other than two - nucleon degrees of freedom in the deuteron wave function can be neglected , one can unambiguously relate the light - cone deuteron wave functions to those calculated in the rest frame in non - relativistic instant - form calculations @xcite .",
    "the final result for the spectral function in the light - cone approach can be written similarly to eq.([ia ] ) , only now @xmath71 is replaced by the light - cone density matrix : @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the relative momentum of the two nucleons on the light - cone , and @xmath63 in eq.([ia ] ) is now the bound nucleon electromagnetic tensor defined on the light - cone .",
    "note that the main operational difference between the instant - form ( [ sif ] ) and light - cone ( [ lcs ] ) impulse approximations is the different relation between the deuteron wave function and the scattering amplitude .",
    "numerical studies have demonstrated that in the kinematical region of interest , @xmath74 gev / c , the difference between the results of the two approximations ( for the same deuteron wave function ) is quite small  see sec.[numcom ] and ref.@xcite .",
    "the structure functions for the scattering from the off-``+''-shell bound nucleons may depend on the variables of this nucleon similarly to the case of the bethe - salpeter , or covariant feynman , approach . in another language",
    "this dependence can be interpreted as the presence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in the deuteron . with this",
    "is mind , we shall use eq.([ia ] ) as the basis for the results discussed in the following sections . before focusing on specific model calculations of the semi - inclusive deuteron structure functions , however ,",
    "let us first turn our attention to the validity of the impulse approximation , and the problem of final state interactions in particular .      in the kinematical region defined by eq.([skin",
    "] ) the contribution of direct processes , where a nucleon is produced in the @xmath42 interaction , is negligible @xcite . therefore within the framework of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) ) below , where final state interactions have a small contribution , eq.([e7 ] ) . ]",
    "the total deuteron tensor @xmath75 can be expressed through the nucleon electromagnetic currents as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the impulse approximation operator , while @xmath78 describes the soft final state interactions between the final hadronic products and the spectator nucleon .",
    "the function @xmath79 now represents the spectral function distorted by fsi effects .",
    "analysis @xcite of the recent high energy deep - inelastic scattering data on slow neutron production @xcite is rather indicative that even in heavy nuclei final state interactions are small , so that the average number of hadrons which reinteract in the target does not exceed unity .",
    "this indicates that the system which is produced in the @xmath42 interaction is quite coherent and interacts at high energies with a relatively small effective cross section , @xmath80 such a situation allows one to factorize the @xmath42 interaction and use the calculation of fsi in @xmath81 processes as a conservative upper limit .    the final simplification which we can gain is to consider the extreme backward kinematics where , in addition to eq.([skin ] )",
    ", we also require : @xmath82 in this case it can be shown @xcite that : @xmath83 ,   \\label{e7}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the average separation of the nucleons within the deuteron , @xmath85 is the spectator nucleon energy , and @xmath86 is the energy evaluated at the average transverse momentum @xmath87 200300 mev / c transferred for the hadronic soft interactions with effective cross section @xmath88 .",
    "the steep momentum dependence of the deuteron wave function , @xmath89 , ensures that fsi effects are suppressed in the extreme backward kinematics , in which case the original impulse approximation expression for @xmath90 can be used rather than @xmath79 . finally , expressing the electromagnetic tensor of the nucleon , @xmath91 , through the effective nucleon structure function @xmath65 and @xmath92 ,",
    "we can then write for the deuteron tensor : @xmath93 defining @xmath94 to be the semi - inclusive structure functions in eqs.([e4 ] ) with the spectral function factored , @xmath95 one can express the semi - inclusive nucleon functions in terms of the effective structure functions of the nucleon as :    [ e8 ] @xmath96    where    [ tnu ] @xmath97    note that within impulse approximation the callan - gross relation between the @xmath65 and @xmath92 structure functions is preserved .",
    "therefore the experimental verification of this relation could serve as another way to identify fsi effects .",
    "equations ( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ tnu ] ) show that at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath98 , when @xmath99 the longitudinal structure function , @xmath100 , does not depend explicitly on the transverse momentum of the nucleon .",
    "it contains @xmath69 dependence only in the argument of the bound nucleon structure functions , which arises from the possible nuclear modifications of the nucleon s parton distributions . the above argument , and the fact that fsi of hadronic products with @xmath101 gev / c practically conserve @xmath34 , allows one to conclude that the fsi effect on @xmath100 is minimal .    on the other hand the functions @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 do explicitly depend on the spectator transverse momentum and therefore the hadronic reinteractions in the final state may strongly affect these structure functions .",
    "such a situation suggests that a separate study of the complete set of the structure functions will allow one to investigate the effects of final state interactions in the deep - inelastic @xmath0 reactions .",
    "note that for the production of spectators with @xmath105 , fsi effects are not likely to depend strongly on @xmath1 for @xmath106 .",
    "this is because at @xmath107 the essential longitudinal distances in deep - inelastic scattering are small .",
    "therefore for these kinematics one expects that @xmath108 .",
    "the effect of fsi will be investigated in the dedicated deep - inelastic scattering experiments at hermes which will measure the @xmath2-dependence of the forward produced hadrons .",
    "these observations enable us to conclude that in the kinematic region defined by eqs.([e5 ] ) , ( [ skin ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) , where the contribution of @xmath100 is enhanced and fsi effects are small , the differential cross section ( [ e3 ] ) can be written : @xmath109   \\nonumber \\\\   & = & { 2\\alpha_{em}^2 \\over q^4 } ( 1-y ) s(\\alpha_s , p_t )       f^{eff}_{2n}\\left({x\\over 2-\\alpha_s},p_t , q^2\\right ) \\label{e9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made the transformation @xmath110 , with @xmath111 .",
    "based on the expectation that fsi effects should not strongly depend on @xmath1 , from eq.([e9 ] ) it may be advantageous to consider the ratio of cross sections relative to a given @xmath1 , in the range 0.10.2 , where the observed emc effect in inclusive scattering is small @xcite : @xmath112 in our analysis we will consider only production of backward nucleons , @xmath113 , to suppress contributions from the direct processes where a nucleon is produced in the @xmath42 interaction vertex .",
    "the more liberal condition , eq.([skin ] ) , is in reality sufficient @xcite .",
    "note also that for heavier nuclei the fsi becomes much more important in the limit of large @xmath1 . as was demonstrated in ref.@xcite , in this limit rescattering of hadrons produced in the elementary deep - inelastic scattering off the short - range correlation",
    "is dynamically enhanced , since the average value of the bjorken - variable for this mechanism is @xmath114 , as opposed to @xmath115 for the spectator mechanism . in this sense",
    "the deuteron target provides the best way of looking for the emc effect for bound nucleons .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize several models of the emc effect which we use in our analysis and present their predictions for the tagged structure functions .",
    "the differences between the models stem from dynamical assumptions about the deformation of the bound nucleon wave functions , and from the fraction of the emc effect attributed to non - baryonic ( mesonic ) degrees of freedom in nuclei  from the dominant part in some versions of the binding model , to the models where non - baryonic degrees of freedom play no role , as in the color screening or qcd radiation models .",
    "( other models which have been used in studies of semi - inclusive dis include the six - quark cluster models discussed in refs.@xcite . )",
    "one of the simplest of the early ideas proposed to explain the nuclear emc effect was the nuclear binding model , in which the main features of the emc effect could be understood in terms of conventional nuclear degrees of freedom  nucleons and pions  responsible for the binding in nuclei @xcite . within the formalism of sec.[if ] , the inclusive nuclear structure function in the emc ratio , eq.([remc ] ) , is expressed through a convolution of the nuclear spectral function and the structure function of the bound ( off - shell ) nucleon ( c.f .",
    "eq.([ia ] ) ) .",
    "contributions from dis from the pionic fields themselves , which are needed to balance overall momentum conservation , were considered in refs.@xcite , however , their role is most evident only at small @xmath1 ( @xmath116 ) .    the bulk of the suppression of the emc ratio ( [ remc ] ) at @xmath117 in the binding model can be attributed to the fact that the average value for the interacting nucleon light - cone fraction is less than unity . for the case of the deuteron , this corresponds to the average spectator light - cone fraction @xmath118 , which is contrary to what one would have from fermi motion alone , where the average @xmath34 is @xmath119 .",
    "a relatively minor role is played by the structure function of the bound nucleon itself  the only requirement is that it be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is clearly the case for the on - shell structure function , and since the off - shell behavior of the bound nucleon structure function is unknown , most early versions of the binding model simply neglected the possible dependence on @xmath67 with the expectation that it is not large for weakly bound systems .",
    "only very recently has the issue of off - shell dependence in the bound nucleon structure function been addressed @xcite , where the first attempts to construct models for the @xmath67 dependence of @xmath92 were made .",
    "note that a consequence of assuming the absence of any off - shell effects in @xmath92 is that the tagged structure function ratio @xmath120 in eq.([g ] ) , normalized to the corresponding ratio for a free proton , would be unity ( see fig.5 below ) . any observed deviation of this ratio from unity would therefore be a signal of the presence of nucleon off - shell effects .",
    "if in a dilute system such as the deuteron the nucleon off - shell effects do not play a major role ( at least at @xmath121 ) , one could expand the effective nucleon structure function in a taylor series about @xmath122 : @xmath123 here the off - shell dependence is determined , to order @xmath56 , entirely by the derivative of @xmath92 with respect to @xmath67 . in order to model this correction a microscopic model of the nucleon structure",

    ", the effective nucleon structure function can be written as an integral over the quark momentum @xmath124 of the quark spectral function @xmath125 : @xmath126 to proceed from eq.([rho ] ) requires additional assumptions about the quark spectral function .",
    "the simplest is to assume that the @xmath67 and @xmath127 dependence in @xmath125 is factored @xcite , which then leads to an explicit constraint on the @xmath67 derivative of @xmath92 from baryon number conservation in the deuteron : @xmath128 this then allows @xmath129 to be determined from the @xmath1-dependence of the on - shell structure function @xmath130 in terms of a single parameter , the squared mass of the intermediate state `` diquark '' system that is spectator to the deep - inelastic collision , @xmath131 .",

    "in particular , the vertices were chosen to be @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the vertex functions , on the other hand , is more difficult to derive , and must in practice be either parameterized or calculated by solving bound state faddeev equations in simple models of the nucleon @xcite . in order to obtain realistic static properties of the nucleon , and to account for the bound nature of the nucleon state",

    "a significant emc effect in inclusive @xmath143 reactions occurs for @xmath1440.6 which corresponds to the high - momentum component of the quark distribution in the nucleon .",

    "it was observed in refs.@xcite that the original emc data could be roughly fitted as : @xmath186 with @xmath187 for @xmath188  gev@xmath133 , the so - called dynamical rescaling .",
    "the phenomenological observation has been interpreted as an indication that gluon radiation occurs more efficiently in a nucleus than in a free nucleon ( at the same @xmath32 ) due to quark delocalization , either in a bound nucleon ( or in two nearby nucleons ) @xcite or in the nucleus as a whole @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 dependence of @xmath189 follows from the requirement that both sides of eq.([eq.5.39 ] ) should satisfy the qcd evolution equations . in the leading logarithmic approximation one has : @xmath190 experimentally @xmath191 is positive if @xmath192 and negative if @xmath193 , where @xmath194 .",
    "so eq.([eq.5.39 ] ) predicts that the emc effect should vanish at @xmath195 .",
    "if the confinement size in a nucleus , @xmath196 , is larger than that in a free nucleon , one may expect that the @xmath32 evolution of the parton distributions in nuclei ( the bremsstrahlung of gluons and quarks ) may start at @xmath197 . to reproduce eq.([eq.5.39 ] ) one should have : @xmath198^{-1}. \\label{eq.5.41}\\ ] ] assuming on dimensional grounds that the radii of quark localization in a nucleus , @xmath196 , and in a nucleon , @xmath199 , are related via : @xmath200 to the scale for the onset of evolution , @xmath201 ,",
    "one finally obtains : @xmath202 a fit to the original emc data using eq.([eq.5.39 ] ) leads to @xmath203(20 gev@xmath133)=2 . for @xmath204  gev@xmath133 and @xmath205  mev",
    "this corresponds to : @xmath206    since in this model the delocalization is approximately proportional to the nuclear density , one can expect that the effect is also proportional to the @xmath185 of a bound nucleon . fixing the parameters of the model to fit the fe data , and assuming @xmath207 we obtain @xmath208 , where @xmath209  gev@xmath133/c@xmath133 . using this expression for",
    "@xmath210 one can calculate the @xmath211 according to eqs.([eq.5.40])([eq.5.43 ] ) and express the effective structure function of a bound nucleon as : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is defined through @xmath34 and @xmath69 according to eq.([k ] ) .",
    "comparison of predictions of the models for the nuclear emc effect considered in the preceding sections is most meaningful in the kinematic range where , firstly , fsi effects are small , and secondly , the instant - form and light - cone prescriptions for the deuteron spectral function lead to similar results",
    ".    direct calculation of the fsi contribution to the cross section would require knowledge of the full dynamics of the final @xmath214@xmath215 system , which is a practically impossible task given the present level of understanding of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "however , it is possible to estimate the uncertainty which would be introduced through neglect of fsi , by using the calculation of fsi effects in the high - energy @xmath216 ( break - up ) reaction in refs.@xcite , and replacing the @xmath17@xmath142 rescattering cross section by an effective cross section for the @xmath217@xmath215 interaction , eq.([e7 ] ) . for the effective cross section @xmath88 one can use the results of the recent analysis @xcite of soft neutron production in the high - energy deep - inelastic scattering of muons from heavy nuclei @xcite , which yielded an upper limit of @xmath218 mb",
    ". to be on the conservative side , in the following estimates we therefore use the value of @xmath218 mb suggested by string models of fsi ( for a recent summary see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , by retaining only the imaginary part of the spectator nucleon rescattering amplitude , one obtains an upper limit of the fsi effect , since the real part will contribute to elastic rescattering only , effectively suppressing the value of @xmath88 .",
    "in fig.1 we illustrate the @xmath34 dependence of the ratio of the ( light - cone ) spectral function including fsi effects within the dwia , eq.([e7 ] ) , to that calculated without fsi effects . at extreme backward kinematics @xmath219",
    "one sees that fsi effects contribute less than @xmath220 to the overall uncertainty of the @xmath221 cross section for @xmath222 . as mentioned above , this number can be considered rather as an upper limit on the uncertainties due to fsi . at larger @xmath69 ( @xmath223 gev / c ) , and small @xmath34 ( @xmath224 ) , the double scattering contribution ( which is not present for the extreme backward case in eq.([e7 ] ) ) plays a more important role in fsi @xcite . because its sign is positive , it tends to cancel some of the absorption effects of fsi at large @xmath69 ( for a detailed discussion of the double scattering contribution in fsi see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "note also that the fsi effects do not change significantly with energy for fixed @xmath32 .",
    "thus , for the ratios discussed , where the cross sections are compared for the same @xmath32 but different @xmath1 , the changes due to fsi effects are even smaller .    to extract unambiguous information from the semi - inclusive cross section ratios on the medium modifications of the nucleon structure discussed in this section requires one to establish the regions of kinematics where the differences between the various prescriptions for the deuteron spectral function are minimal . in fig.2",
    "we illustrate the @xmath34 and @xmath69 dependence of the ratio of spectral functions calculated in the light - cone ( [ lcs ] ) and instant - form ( [ sif ] ) approaches . for @xmath225  gev / c the light - cone and instant - form predictions differ up to the 20% for the entire range of @xmath226 .",
    "however , choosing the isolated values of @xmath227 or @xmath228 one can confine the uncertainty in the spectral function to within 10% , which will offer the optimal conditions in which to study the nucleon structure modification .    in fig.3",
    "we show the @xmath34 dependence of the ratio of the effective proton structure function , @xmath229 , for extreme backward kinematics , @xmath230 , to the structure function of a free proton .",
    "as expected , the suppression of the ratio in the version of the binding model with explicit nucleon off - shell corrections is quite small , @xmath231 for @xmath232 , reflecting the relatively minor role played here by off - shell effects in the nucleon structure function .",
    "( note that in versions of the binding model in which there is no @xmath67 dependence in the effective nucleon structure function this ratio would be unity . )",
    "the effects in the plc suppression and rescaling models in fig.3 are somewhat larger . for a neutron target one",
    "predicts similar results , however , the neutron structure function is not as well known experimentally as the proton due to the absence of free neutron targets ( see section iv ) . for this reason",
    "we restrict our discussion to ratios of proton structure functions only .    in fig.4",
    "we illustrate the dependence of @xmath233 on the variable @xmath234 , where @xmath67 is the bound nucleon virtuality defined in eq.([virt ] ) and @xmath235 mev is the deuteron binding energy .",
    "the comparison in fig.4 is done for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is noticeable that because of the negligible amount of the plc component in the nucleon wave function at @xmath236 , the plc suppression model predicts no modification of the structure function in this region . on the other hand , at @xmath237",
    "it predicts a maximal effect because of the plc dominance in the nucleon wave function here .    because the momentum ( virtuality ) dependent density effect generates the modification of the bound nucleon structure functions in the plc suppression and rescaling models , the ratios for these models at @xmath238 0.50.6 vary similarly with @xmath34 and @xmath234 , as does also the off - shell model ratio .",
    "however the mechanism for such a variation is different , which is clearly seen in fig.5 , where the @xmath1 dependence of the same ratio is represented at different values of @xmath239 and fixed @xmath230 .",
    "the curves for the off - shell model extend only to @xmath240 because for larger @xmath1 values the approximations discussed in sec.[if ] involved in obtaining eq.([ia ] ) become numerically less justified @xcite .    to further reduce any uncertainties due to the deuteron spectral function in the model comparisons , we concentrate on the predictions for the ratio @xmath241 , defined in eq.([g ] ) , of experimentally measured cross sections at two different values of @xmath1 @xcite . since the function @xmath120 is defined by the ratio of cross sections at the same @xmath34 and @xmath69 , any uncertainties in the spectral function cancel .",
    "this allows one to extend this ratio to larger values of @xmath34 , thereby increasing the utility of the semi - inclusive reactions when analyzed in terms of this function .",
    "figure 6 shows the @xmath34 and @xmath32 dependence of @xmath241 at @xmath230 .",
    "the values of @xmath242 and @xmath243 are selected to fulfill the condition @xmath244 ( large emc effect in inclusive measurements ) and @xmath245 ( essentially no emc effect in inclusive measurements ) .",
    "again , the plc suppression and @xmath32 rescaling models predict a much faster drop with @xmath34 than does the binding / off - shell model , where the @xmath34 dependence is quite weak .",
    "the presence of an emc effect in the deuteron leads to substantial suppression of the deuteron structure function at large @xmath1 compared to what one would expect from models without non - nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the estimate of ref.@xcite , @xmath246 which is valid for a rather wide class of models in which the emc effect is proportional to the mean value of @xmath67 in nuclei , gives a ratio @xmath247 35% below unity at @xmath248 0.60.7 . calculations of the deuteron structure function in models in which binding effects are explicitly taken into account also produce similar effects @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the emc effect in the extraction of the the neutron structure function from the inclusive @xmath249 scattering data leads to significantly larger values for @xmath250 than the 1/4 value obtained in analyses in which only fermi motion is included .",
    "the values for @xmath250 with inclusion of the emc effect at @xmath117 @xcite are in fact much closer to the expectation of 3/7 from perturbative qcd , predicted by farrar and jackson @xcite",
    ". therefore observation of a value of @xmath250 higher than the 1/4 extracted from inclusive data in the early analyses would by itself serve as another proof of the presence of the emc effect in the deuteron .",
    "although other methods to obtain the large-@xmath1 @xmath251 ratio ( or the @xmath252 ratio ) have been suggested , none has so far been able to clearly discriminate between the different @xmath253 limits for @xmath250 ( namely , @xmath254 , which is the minimal possible value allowed in the parton model , which corresponds to @xmath255 , and @xmath256 in perturbative qcd @xcite ) .",
    "for example , with @xmath22 and @xmath257 beams on proton targets one can in principle measure the @xmath258 and @xmath259 quark distributions separately , however , the statistics in @xmath22 experiments in general are relatively poor",
    ". another possibility would be to extract the @xmath252 ratio from charged lepton asymmetries at large rapidities , in @xmath260-boson production in @xmath261 scattering @xcite , although here it may be some time still before a sufficient quantity of large - rapidity events at the cdf at fermilab are accumulated .",
    "on the other hand , with tagged deuteron experiments planned for hermes , a study of the tagged structure functions may allow a resolution of this ambiguity @xcite .",
    "it is important that the ratio of tagged structure functions interpolated to the nucleon pole should be exactly equal to the free nucleon ratio  this is the analog of the chew - low interpolation for the pion case : @xmath262 in practice the data can not be accumulated for too small @xmath263 .",
    "however , we observed above that deviations of the ratio from the free limit is proportional to @xmath67 with a good accuracy .",
    "hence , if one samples the data as a function of @xmath67 interpolation to the pole @xmath264 should be smooth . in practice ,",
    "considering momentum intervals of 100200 mev / c and 200350 mev / c would be sufficient .",
    "a potential problem with eq.([f2np ] ) is that at very large @xmath1 ( @xmath265 ) the factorization approximation itself breaks down and higher order corrections to eq.([ia ] ) , which are @xmath266 , must be included if one wants accuracy to within a few % . to be on the safe side one should therefore restrict the analysis to smaller spectator momenta , below 200 mev / c .",
    "despite the many years of study of the deviations from unity of the ratios of nuclear to deuteron cross sections in inclusive high - energy scattering , we have been unable to isolate the microscopic origin of the nucleon structure modification in the nuclear environment @xcite  the effect can be described in terms of a number of models based on quite disparate physical assumptions . in this paper",
    "we have argued that by allowing greater accessibility to kinematic variables not available in inclusive reactions , semi - inclusive deep - inelastic processes offer the possibility to make further progress in understanding the origin of the nuclear emc effect .",
    "in particular , measurements of tagged structure functions of the deuteron can probe the extent of the deformation of the intrinsic structure of a bound nucleon .",
    "taking ratios of semi - inclusive cross sections at different values of @xmath1 enables the cancellation in the tagged structure function ratio , eq.([g ] ) , of the dependence on the deuteron wave function , thus permitting the nucleon structure to be probed directly .",
    "our results show that possible contamination of the signal due to the final state interactions of the spectator nucleon with the hadronic debris can be minimized by tagging only on the slow backward nucleons in the target fragmentation region .",
    "this may then allow one to discriminate between models in which the emc effect is attributed entirely to the nucleon wave function deformation , and ones in which the effect arises from more traditional descriptions in terms of meson  nucleon degrees of freedom associated with nuclear binding .    as a by - product of the semi - inclusive measurements , one may also be able to extract information on the large-@xmath1 behavior of the neutron to proton structure function ratio , by detecting recoiling protons and neutrons with small transverse momentum in the extreme backward kinematics . extracting this ratio from inclusive @xmath267 and @xmath249 data",
    "is fraught with large uncertainties arising from different treatments of the nuclear physics in the deuteron .",
    "observation of an asymptotic value for @xmath250 which is larger than the ` canonical ' 1/4 would in itself be proof of the presence of an emc effect in the deuteron .",
    "first information about the spectra of backward nucleons in @xmath268 scattering is likely to come from the jefferson lab experiment # 94 - 102 @xcite , and from the hermes experiment at hera , where the necessary counting rate may be achieved after an upgrade of the detector @xcite .",
    "having two energy ranges would be very useful for checking the basic production mechanism , and understanding backgrounds and corrections due to final state interactions , which are likely to depend substantially on the incident energy .",
    "final state interaction effects can also be tracked by studying the production of nucleons from heavier nuclei .",
    "probing the quark - gluon structure of short - range correlations with heavy nuclei targets should further enable one to determine whether nucleon deformations predominantly depend on the nucleon momentum , or also on @xmath2 .",
