    "we refine some of these earlier results , and consider implications for different notions of _ chern classes _ associated with divisors .",
    "specifically , we strengthen the first result recalled above , by showing that splayedness is already characterized by the leibniz property after restriction to the union of the divisors ; equivalently , this amounts to a leibniz property for the ideals defining the _ singularity subschemes _ for the divisors at @xmath1 ( corollary  [ corol : jpsplayed ] and  [ corol : jsplayed ] ) .",
    "we introduce a ` splayedness module ' , which we describe both in terms of these ideals and in terms of modules of logarithmic derivations ( definition  [ def : splayedmod ] , proposition  [ prop : splayedmod ] ) , and whose vanishing is equivalent to splayedness .",
    "thus , this module quantifies precisely the failure of splayedness of two divisors meeting at a point .",
    "these results may be expressed in terms of the quality of certain natural morphisms associated with two divisors .",
    "for example , given two divisors @xmath2 , @xmath3 meeting at a point @xmath1 and without common components , there is a natural monomorphism @xmath4 involving quotients of modules of logarithmic derivations .",
    "we prove that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are splayed at @xmath1 if and only if this monomorphism is an isomorphism ( theorem  [ thm : dermodcrit ] ) .",

    "thus , if @xmath8 is free at @xmath1 , then @xmath2 and  @xmath3 are splayed at @xmath1 if and only if the two modules in are equal . in general",
    "this condition alone does not imply splayedness , as example  [ ex : additivomega ] shows .",
    "one advantage of expressing splayedness in terms of these morphisms is that the characterizing conditions globalize nicely , and give conditions on morphisms of _ sheaves _ of logarithmic derivations and differentials characterizing splayedness at all points of intersection of two divisors .",
    "these conditions imply identities involving chern classes for these sheaves ( corollary  [ cor : chern ] ) . in certain situations ( for example in the case of curves on surfaces )",
    "these identities actually characterize splayedness . also , there is a different notion of ` chern class ' that can be associated with a divisor  @xmath8 in a nonsingular variety @xmath0 , namely the chern - schwartz - macpherson ( @xmath9 ) class of the complement @xmath10 .",
    "( see   [ csmintro ] for a rapid reminder of this notion ) . in previous work",
    ", the first - named author has determined several situations where this @xmath9 class _ equals _ the chern class @xmath11 of the sheaf of logarithmic differentials .",
    "it is then natural to expect that @xmath9 classes of complements of splayed divisors , and more general subvarieties , should satisfy a similar type of relations as the one obtained for ordinary chern classes of sheaves of derivations . from this point of view",
    "we analyze three template sources of splayed subvarieties : subvarieties defined by pull - backs from factors of a product ( proposition  [ pro : products ] ) , joins of projective varieties ( proposition  [ pro : joins ] ) , and the case of curves ( proposition  [ pro : curves ] ) . in each of the three situations we are able to verify explicitly that the corresponding expected relation of @xmath9 classes does hold .",
    "we hope to come back to the question of the validity of this relation for arbitrary splayed subvarieties in future work .",
