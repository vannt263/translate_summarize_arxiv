    "within the first few years of lhc data collection and analysis , a key issue will not only be the search for general signs of new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) , but also quantitative measurement of any np particles produced .",
    "np mass spectra , in particular , can offer an important handle on discriminating between different np models . in the highly theoretically - motivated minimal supersymmetric(susy ) standard model ( mssm ) , for example , many of the 100 + free input parameters , among which various relations are predicted by specific models of susy - breaking , are directly coupled to values of susy masses .",
    "in contrast to the situation at a lepton collider , where the center - of - mass ( cm ) collision energy can be precisely tuned to sweep through np mass resonances , the lhc produces partonic collisions whose cm energies vary unpredictably from event to event , washing out potential resonance structures .",
    "moreover , np states may decay only partially to visible and detectable particles , as in the r - parity - conserving mssm , where sparticles typically cascade down to sm states plus an even number of invisible lightest susy particles ( lsps ) .",
    "any mssm mass reconstruction technique applied to lhc data can not therefore depend on the precise cm energy or total visibility of decay products .    in answer to these demands ,",
    "the phenomenological community has innovated a number of different mass reconstruction methods , the most standard and well - tested among these relying on measuring endpoints of various invariant mass distributions constructed from visible final leptonic and/or jet 4-momenta@xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "for example , 3-body decays of the second neutralino to a pair of leptons plus the lsp , @xmath0 , gives rise to a dilepton invariant mass distribution @xmath1 which cuts off relatively sharply at @xmath2 . with a sufficiently large event sample",
    "this mass difference can be determined very precisely ( to the sub - gev level ) , but the values of the individual masses themselves are undetermined  this is typical of the endpoint method , where the endpoint is generally some function of a number of np masses .",
    "the present work introduces the idea that there can be more information at the endpoint than just its numerical value  events lying at the endpoint may arise from a unique kinematic configuration of final momenta in a decaying particle s frame  and additional analysis can be done to find the masses .",
    "let this be defined as the dk ( decay - frame kinematics ) technique .",
    "as a first example , consider the 3-body decay noted above . an event at the dilepton endpoint must be such that , in the @xmath3 decay frame , the @xmath4 is at rest while the leptons are produced with equal and opposite momenta ( the dilepton system has zero velocity ) .",
    "this fact allows us to find the velocity of the @xmath3 in the detector frame : namely , it is the observed velocity of the dilepton system , @xmath5 .",
    "when we apply the corresponding lorentz boost to the lsp 4-vector @xmath6 and match to observed missing transverse momenta , the lsp mass can be easily solved for  twice in fact , from each transverse direction . the fact that r - parity requires a pair of such decays in each event changes nothing essential : one simply finds both @xmath3 velocities from events at a _ double - endpoint _",
    ", i.e. where both dilepton invariants are maximal , matching missing momentum to the sum of lsp momenta . although no event ever lies exactly at a double - endpoint , a large number of events may be within a tolerably small neighborhood of it  one would expect that using these to reconstuct the lsp mass as above would give a distribution peaked at the correct value .",
    "there are , of course , immediate practical limitations  how small does the neighborhood have to be , do detector effects and backgrounds smear the peak beyond recognition , etc .  which must ultimately fall to a monte carlo test in order to properly address .    as a second example of the dk technique in this paper",
    ", we shall consider production of neutralino - chargino pairs @xmath7 in the mssm , with subsequent decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "though slightly more complicated than the case of neutralino - pair decays , the same principle works : events at a particular endpoint belong to a certain class of kinematics in the @xmath3 and @xmath10 decay frames , allowing us to find the individual velocities of these latter ; the lsp 4-momenta can then be boosted and matched to observed missing momentum for only one ( correct ) value of the chargino mass",
    ".    the structure of this work will be as follows : section [ sec : zz ] will illustrate the dk technique in more detail in the case of neutralino - pair production , where the goal is lsp mass - reconstruction  this includes a monte carlo simulation to test how well the technique might actually work with lhc data . section [ sec : wz ]",
    "then does the same for neutralino - chargino pair production , again seeing how well the chargino mass can be reconstructed .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] summarizes these results , comments on the relation to other mass reconstruction techniques in the literature , and discusses general applicability .",
    "consider production of neutralino pairs in the mssm which undergo 3-body decays to electrons and muons : @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents either z * or any mssm production channel from a higgs ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) or colored gluino / squark cascades , while @xmath15 are sm states potentially produced in association , all irrelevant to the current discussion ; note we could include @xmath16 and @xmath17 endstates as well , but at the price of a two - fold ambiguity in lepton pairing in what follows .",
    "physical observables from one event thus consist of four leptonic 4-momenta @xmath18 ( from which we may construct the usual dilepton invariant masses , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and missing momentum in two transverse directions , assumed equal to the sum of the two @xmath4s transverse momenta , @xmath21 .",
    "decay kinematics ( see appendix ) allow us to write the following list of constraints on the relevant neutralino masses ( hereafter we abbreviate @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 where leptonic momenta are written in the frame of the respective parent neutralino , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 , defining the appropriate lorentz transformations @xmath26 .",
    "in general , of course , we do not know the lorentz boosts @xmath27 from which @xmath26 are constructed , so ( [ constraint1])-([constraint3 ] ) represents a system of four equations ( or six , if the dilepton endpoints @xmath28 are known ) for nine unknowns ( @xmath27 and the masses @xmath29 ) which obviously can not be solved uniquely for the masses .     and",

    "[ fig : zizj ] ) , we would of course get @xmath45 ; in practice , of course , we can only expect to capture an event within some neighborhood @xmath46 of the endpoints , @xmath47 , in which case one can show ( see appendix ) that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are approximately @xmath50 .",
    "one might then expect that applying ( [ betaeqn1 ] ) and ( [ m1eqn ] ) to a sample of events near the endpoint should give a distribution of @xmath48 and @xmath49 peaked near @xmath43 with a @xmath51 spread .    as a technical caveat to the above",
    ", things could go wrong if @xmath52 : this occurs if the neutralinos @xmath30 happen to travel in opposite transverse directions with precisely the correct velocities , i.e. @xmath53 = 0 . in this case the formulae ( [ m1eqn ] ) give us indeterminate solutions @xmath54 .",
    "even if @xmath40 is finite but small ( say a few gev ) we might still worry that statistical fluctuations to @xmath55 would likewise throw off the solutions ( [ m1eqn ] ) .",
    "this will not be a serious concern , however , if most events contain significant  upstream transverse momentum \" ( utm)@xcite in @xmath12 or @xmath15 , and we will presently see that a monte carlo simulation of a typical lhc environment , adding in experimental effects such as measurement errors and inherent finiteness of detector resolution , as well as the inclusion of sm and mssm backgrounds , basically confirms the robustness of dk mass reconstruction .      in order to see how well the above programme might work with real data , let us apply it to monte carlo simulated lhc data , choosing for definiteness the following mssm parameter point : @xmath56 which is a modification of the sps1a benchmark point@xcite enhancing the @xmath57 branching ratio .",
