    "a large fraction of x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) monitored by swift in the last 2.5 years exhibit ( figure [ xlc ] ) _ flares _ ( short , brightening episodes during which the x - ray flux increases by a factor up to 1000 ) and _ plateaus _ ( power - law flux decays slower than expected in the standard blast - wave model , for the measured slope of the x - ray spectrum ) .    the short duration @xmath0 of x - ray flares ( burrows et al 2007 ) , half of which have @xmath1 ( chincarini et al 2007 ) , is incompatible with an origin in the shock driven into the circumburst medium by the grb ejecta ( the _ forward shock _ ) because its emission fluctuations can not be both very bright and short - lived . if the fluctuation s angular scale is @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the shock s lorentz factor ( i.e. larger than the area visible to the observer ) , then the flare should last for @xmath4 , which is the spread in the photon arrival - time caused by the curvature of the visible emitting surface .",
    "if the fluctuation s angular scale is less than @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , then the flare s duration , @xmath8 , can be arbitrarily small but the fluctuation s surface brightness would have to be @xmath9 larger than that of the forward shock to overshine it and yield a flare that is 11000 times brighter than the underlying forward - shock flux .    the inability of the forward shock to produce short and bright flares has been taken as indication ( e.g. zhang et al 2006 ) that flares originate from the same mechanism as the burst : internal shocks in a fluctuating outflow ( rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "this model requires that the central engine producing the grb ejecta must live for a lab - frame duration comparable to the observer time when the flare is seen .",
    "the x - ray light - curve plateaus are generally smooth , thus a forward - shock interpretation is plausible .",
    "that , during the plateau , the x - ray flux decays slower than expected in the standard forward - shock model ( e.g. paczyski & rhoads 1993 , mszros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) requires that at least one of the assumptions of this model is invalid . as the x - ray flux depends on the blast - wave energy and the electron & magnetic field parameters in the forward shock , non - constancy of any of these quantities may explain the slow decay of x - ray plateaus : nousek et al ( 2006 ) , panaitescu et al ( 2006a ) , and zhang et al ( 2006 ) have proposed that energy is injected into the forward shock , ioka et al ( 2006 ) studied the light - curves arising from evolving microphysical parameters , and fan & piran ( 2006 ) analyzed the afterglow emission when all three quantities evolve .",
    "however , the existence of _ chromatic _ x - ray breaks at the end of some plateaus ( e.g. grb afterglows 050401 and 070110 shown in figure [ xlc ] ) , which are not exhibited by the optical light - curve , poses a serious problem to the above interpretation of plateaus because such a decoupling of the optical and x - ray emissions requires a strong spectral break to cross the x - ray range at the time of the chromatic break , yet the slope of the x - ray continuum is not observed to change across the break ( nousek et al 2006 , willingale et al 2007 , liang et al 2007 ) .    the chromatic x - ray breaks may indicate that the afterglow emission arises from the reverse - shock crossing some inflowing , late ejecta that catch - up with the forward shock during the plateau .",
    "again , to obtain the required decoupling of the optical and x - ray light - curves , a spectral break must be in between those domain : uhm & beloborodov ( 2007 ) attributed that break to the cooling of reverse - shock electrons , while genet , daigne & mochkovitch ( 2007 ) identified it with the characteristic synchrotron frequency at which electrons would radiate if only 1 percent of reverse - shock electrons acquired equipartition energies .",
    "it remains to be investigated if , by tracking the cooling of forward - shock electrons during energy injection or by assuming that only 1 percent of them reach equipartition , the forward - shock acquires the same ability to decouple the optical and x - ray light - curves as the reverse shock may have .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to focus on the forward - shock emission , which naturally explains the power - law decay of afterglow light - curves , and investigate the possibility that the decoupling of the optical and x - ray emissions is due to a substantial contribution to the x - ray flux from an incoming , delayed outflow which up - scatters the forward - shock emission .",
    "half of the synchrotron photons emitted by the forward shock are left behind it ( the half which , in the shock frame , are emitted at an angle @xmath10 relative to the radial direction of motion ) and boosted relativistically by a factor ranging from @xmath3 ( for @xmath11 ) to @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "the former are caught - up with by the incoming outflow if its lorentz factor @xmath14 is larger than that of the forward - shock ; the latter will always be reached by the scattering outflow ; for either , the doppler boost after scattering is a factor @xmath15 higher than that of a forward - shock photon travelling directly toward the observer ( i.e. the primary emission )    there are two reasons for which the up - scattered emission may be brighter than the primary .",
    "one is that the photon travel from place of emission to that of scattering delays the scattered emission relative to the direct forward - shock emission . given that the latter decays , it follows that the scattered flux arriving at some time may be brighter than the forward - shock flux at same time .",
    "the second reason is at work if @xmath16 . in this case , scattering increases the photon energy more than the doppler boost of the forward - shock does , so that , if the energy of the seed photon is above the peak of the synchrotron spectrum of the forward - shock emission , then the scattered flux at some observer - frame photon energy may exceed that of the forward - shock at same photon energy .",
    "there is also one reason for which the scattered emission could be dimmer than the forward - shock s : for plausible kinetic energies of the scattering outflow ( below about @xmath17 erg ) and the range of radii over which the up - scattering takes place ( the forward - shock radius is @xmath18 cm ) , the scattering outflow is optically thin , thus only a small fraction of the photons left behind by the forward shock will be swept - up .",
    "we assume that the scattering electrons are cold ( i.e. , in the frame of the incoming outflow , the primary photons do not gain energy through electron scattering ) . in this case , for the optical depth to electron scattering to be sufficiently large to yield a scattered flux brighter ( at higher photon energies ) than the forward - shock s , the scattering fluid must consist mostly of electron - positron pairs ( i.e. baryon - poor ) , to maximize the number of leptons for a given kinetic energy and lorentz factor of the scattering outflow .",
    "such a pair - enriched outflow are not expected from radiation - dominated fireballs , owing to pair - annihilation above the photospheric radius , but could result in electromagnetic ( poynting ) outflows ( lyutikov 2006 ) from the dissipation of magnetic around the deceleration radius .",
    "the latter model has received support from the timing of fast - decaying grb tails and the epoch when the forward - shock emission emerges , which suggest that the burst and early afterglow emissions are produced at comparable radii ( @xmath19 cm , kumar et al 2007 ) .",
    "this is a plausible feature of the electromagnetic model and disfavours the internal - shock model for grbs for which the subsecond burst variability timescale requires the grb emission to be produced at @xmath20 cm . alternatively ,",
    "if the short burst variability can be produced at larger radii , then the proximity of the locations where the burst and early afterglow emissions are released would point to internal - external shocks occurring between some incoming ejecta and the decelerating forward - shock ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 1999 ; ramirez - ruiz , merloni & rees 2001 ) .",
    "however , if the scattering electrons are hot ( e.g. accelerated by internal shocks ) , then inverse - compton scattering of forward - shock photons will boost into the x - rays seed photons of even lower energy , which may be numerous enough to compensate for the lower optical thickness of a scattering outflow with a normal baryon - to - lepton load .",
    "thus , a hot outflow with a normal proton - to - electron composition ( as expected for fireballs accelerated by radiation pressure ) may still yield a scattered flux overshining in the x - rays that from the forward shock .",

    "a scattering , relativistic outflow with a significant radial spread can be approximated as a sequence of shells of zero radial thickness , thus we begin by calculating the emission from a scattering surface .",
    "both the forward shock and scattered emissions are integrated over the equal arrival - time surface defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle between the direction of motion of the radiating fluid element and the center of explosion  observer axis . for analytical calculations , one can ignore the spread in the photon arrival - time caused by the spherical curvature of the emitting surface and restrict attention to @xmath29 ( i.e. assume that the fluid is moving directly toward the observer ) .",
    "the only important effect of the surface curvature which must be taken into account that is that , for a source of lorentz factor @xmath30 , the observer receives emission from a patch of angular opening @xmath31 centered on the center  observer axis , as the emission from angles @xmath32 is less boosted relativistically .",

    "for other photons ( @xmath166 ) , the doppler factor of the scatterer  forward - shock relative motion is of the same order , @xmath167 , but the retarded emission time can not be obtained analytically . the scattered emission from a radially - extended outflow is calculated numerically by discretizing it into surfaces and by using the relevant equations of  [ setup]  [ analytical ] to calculate the emission from each surface .",
    "we have verified that ( 1 ) the decays given in equations ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) ( obtained in the @xmath168 approximation ) are correct and ( 2 ) the decay of the scattered light - curve is independent of the incident spectrum for softer spectra ( i.e. independent of the decay of the forward - shock emission ) .",
    "therefore , as expected analytically , there is a `` critical '' spectral slope @xmath155 of the forward - shock emission such that the scattered flux received at some time @xmath26 is mostly that produced by the forward shock at same time @xmath26 , if @xmath169 , or at the onset of deceleration , if @xmath170 .",
    "however , the numerical integration of the scattered flux leads to a @xmath155 that is larger than that given in equations ( [ b01 ] ) and ( [ b02 ] ) by @xmath171 .",

    "the decay of the scattered emission is correlated with the spectral slope @xmath153 .    for the parameters used in figure [ betalc ] ,",
    "the scattered emission is brighter than the forward - shock s ( and yields a light - curve plateau ) only if the spectrum of the forward - shock emission is softer than @xmath178 for @xmath68 and @xmath179 for @xmath69 .",
    "numerically , we find that x - ray plateaus can be obtained for harder forward - shock emissions ( down to the hardest observed xrt spectra ",
    "@xmath180 ) if ( 1 ) the cooling frequency of the forward - shock emission is below x - rays and the up - scattered cooling frequency above , ( 2 ) the lorentz factor or energy of the scattering outflow is larger , or ( 3 ) the scattering electrons are relativistic ( i.e. they inverse - compton scatter the incoming photons ) .      as illustrated in figure [ plateau ]",
    ", the up - scattered emission may overshine the forward - shock s only at higher photon energies ( in the x - rays ) but not at lower frequencies ( e.g. in the optical ) .",
    "this implies that the x - ray plateau produced by scattered forward - shock emission does not appear in the optical .",
    "consequently , the end of the plateau will also be a chromatic feature .",
    "such chromatic light - curve breaks are observed for several grb afterglows : grb 050401 ( watson et al 2006 - figure [ xlc ] ) ; grbs 050319 , 050607 , 050713a , 050802 , 050922c ( panaitescu et al 2006b ) ; grb 070110 ( troja et al 2007 - figure [ xlc ] ) , grb 050318 ( liang et al 2007 ) and , as noted before , can not be accommodated by the forward - shock emission alone .      in figure [ a2b2 ] , we compare the light - curve decay indices and spectral slopes measured by xrt during the x - ray plateau with the analytical results of equations ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) for a constant mass - flux @xmath119 and lorentz factor @xmath14 of the scattering outflow , using the @xmath155 derived numerically ( instead of that given in equations [ b01 ] and [ b02 ] for the central line - of - sight photons ) .",
    "the spectral slopes displayed in figure [ a2b2 ] show that the afterglows without plateaus ( i.e. those for which the forward - shock emission is brighter than the scattered emission at all times ) are generally harder than the afterglows with plateaus .",
    "this confirms the expectation illustrated in figure [ betalc ] for the scattering - outflow model , that plateaus are easier to obtain if the forward - shock emission is softer ( as this leads to a faster - decaying forward - shock light - curve ) .",
    "although most of the afterglow decays displayed in figure [ a2b2 ] are in the @xmath181 region , where the decay index @xmath182 depends on the spectral slope @xmath153 , these two quantities are not correlated ( linear correlation coefficient @xmath183 ) .",
    "this can be due either to that all cases analyzed in  [ case1][case3 ] occur in reality or to that @xmath119 and @xmath14 vary with ejection time @xmath62 ( which is measured directly by the observer time ) for some / most afterglows .    for a power - law radial distribution of the scattering outflow mass - flux ( @xmath184 ) and lorentz factor ( @xmath185 , with @xmath186 because internal shocks lead to a lorentz factor decreasing outward ) , the decay index @xmath187 of the scattered emission is _",
    "sc = m + 2g_x + _",
    "sc(m=0,g=0 ) [ mg ] with @xmath188 being the decay index given in equations ( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f0 ] ) , ( [ f2 ] ) , and ( [ f3 ] ) for a uniform outflow .    therefore , a variety of x - ray plateau decays can be obtained by varying the indices @xmath189 and @xmath30 of equation ( [ mg ] ) .",
    "the same applies to the shape of the flares resulting from up - scattering the forward - shock emission ( figure [ eg ] ) .",
    "in particular , decreasing @xmath119 or @xmath118 yield flares with a slow fall , while an increasing @xmath119 produces flares with a slow rise , which can account for the diverse morphology of x - ray flares identified by chincarini et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "given that the post - plateau x - ray decay depends on the @xmath119 and @xmath118 distributions at @xmath190 , the scattering outflow model can account ( figure [ plateau ] ) for the extremely fast - decaying @xmath191 post - plateau emission observed for grb afterglow 070110 ( troja et al 2007 ) after 20 ks and the @xmath192 post - plateau decays of grbs 050730 ( perri et al 2007 ) , 060413 , and 060607a ( molinari et al 2007 , nysewander et al 2007 ) after 10 ks , and of grb 070311 ( guidorzi et al 2007 ) after 150 ks . if the scattering outflow is concentrated in thin shells then the same model can account for the fast decay of the afterglow emission after flaring episodes , followed by a smooth and slower decay ( from the emergent forward - shock emission ) , as observed for grb afterglow 051117a ( goad et al 2007 ) at 10 ks .",
    "such fast decays can not be explained by the standard forward - shock model .    after the x - ray plateau , the majority of afterglows exhibit a light - curve decay @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath119 and @xmath118 are nearly uniform distributed ( i.e. the indices @xmath189 and @xmath30 of equation [ mg ] are not far from zero ) and that large values of these parameters , mimicking a sharp cut - off in their distribution and yielding sharp post - plateau decays , are rare . figure [ plateau ] ( left panel ) illustrates the chromatic x - ray break , followed by a slow post - plateau decay , that is obtained with a broken power - law for @xmath119 , the transition between the two power - laws being made at the epoch of the x - ray break .",
    "figure [ plateau ] ( right panel ) also shows that scattering of the forward - shock emission may yield a spectrum with a turnover extending up to ( or above ) the x - ray range , thus the scattered emission may be harder than the intrinsic forward - shock emission .",
    "this implies that , sometimes , x - ray plateaus and flares could be harder than the preceding and following x - ray emission . a spectral softening at the end of plateau is not observed ( in general ) , which indicates that either the spectral turn - over formed by up - scattering the peak frequency of the synchrotron forward - shock emission lies below the x - ray or that it is in the x - rays but does not evolve . in the latter case",
    ", the break at the end of plateau should be attributed to a change in the distribution of outflowing mass with depth , as the alternative explanation  a decreasing outflow lorentz factor  would produce a softening of the peak energy of the up - scattered spectrum ( equation [ boost ] ) .",
    "a hardening of the x - ray spectrum , followed by softening , is observed for the flares of grb 050502b ( falcone et al 2006 ) and , perhaps , those of grb 050904 ( cusumano et al 2007 ) occurring _ during the afterglow phase _ , which suggests that the turn - over at the peak of the up - scattered emission spectrum reaches sometimes the 0.310 kev range .",
    "this is consistent with flares originating from regions in the scattering outflow of lorentz factor larger than the average ( i.e. than for the part of the outflow yielding the plateau ) , although it is possible that the spectral peak energy of the flaring emission is larger than that of the plateau s simply because flares occur at earlier times , when the peak frequency of the seed forward - shock emission is higher .",
    "if the scattering electrons are relativistic ( with random lorentz factor @xmath195 in the scattering outflow s frame ) , they will inverse - compton scatter the incident photon and increase its energy by a factor @xmath196 ( in the frame of the scattering fluid ) . then , the comoving intensity in the numerator of the @xmath109 of equation ( [ frac1 ] ) is calculated at comoving frequency @xmath197 .",
    "if this frequency is above the peak frequency of the synchrotron forward - shock emission ( in the shock s frame ) , then the scattered flux will be a factor @xmath198 larger than that obtained for a cold outflow ( equations [ f1 ] , [ f0 ] , and [ f2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the decrease of the scattered flux by factor @xmath199 resulting from going from a cold and purely - leptonic scattering outflow ( as considered so far ) to one with a unity baryon - to - lepton ratio can be compensated for if the latter is hot , so that the incident photons are inverse - compton scattered off electrons with @xmath200 .",
    "this holds true as long as all incident photons up - scattered to observer frequency @xmath201 are ( before being scattered ) above the peak frequency of the forward - shock synchrotron spectrum . for @xmath202 ( as observed ) , it follows that @xmath203 , which implies that the internal shocks energizing the scattering outflow need not be relativistic and the necessary @xmath195 could be produced by small fluctuations in the lorentz factor of the scattering outflow .    alternatively , that @xmath204 implies that a hot , scattering outflow of bulk lorentz factor @xmath205 and comoving - frame electron energy @xmath206 yields the same x - ray scattered flux as a cold outflow of lorentz factor @xmath14 .",
    "thus , if the scattering outflow is hot , then an x - ray plateau can be obtained for a lorentz factor @xmath14 smaller than that considered for figures [ flares ] , [ betalc ] , [ plateau ] , and [ eg ] .      for a given scatterer lorentz factor @xmath14 and forward - shock spectral slope @xmath124",
    ", a wind - like circumburst medium is more likely to yield an x - ray scattered emission brighter than the forward - shock s .",
    "this is primarily due to that , at a fixed observer time , the lorentz factor of the forward - shock is lower for a wind - like medium than for a homogeneous one , as shown by equations ( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) , hence the scattering has a stronger effect ( quantified by the ratio @xmath114 ) for the former case .",
    "comparable forward - shock lorentz factors would require a much higher homogeneous medium density ( @xmath207 ) , which is at odds with with the low synchrotron self - absorption frequency ( below 10 ghz ) , or a much lower wind density ( @xmath208 ) , which is @xmath209 times less tenuous than measured for galactic wr stars .",
    "a second reason for which the scattered emission is more prominent for a wind - like medium is at work when the cooling frequency of the forward - shock emission is above x - rays : in this case , the forward - shock flux decreases faster for a wind - like medium , allowing the scattered emission to emerge .",
    "therefore , the scattering - outflow model for the x - ray plateaus favours a circumburst medium with the @xmath210 radial stratification expected for a massive star as the grb progenitor",
    ".    however , we note that , if the scattering electrons are relativistic , then the ratio of scattered and direct fluxes is quantified by @xmath211 , thus a hotter scattering outflow could compensate for the above two factors which favour a wind - like medium .",
    "the results presented in preceding sections illustrate that the up - scattering of the forward - shock emission by a more relativistic , lepton - enhanced outflow can accommodate four puzzling x - ray features discovered by swift : flares , plateaus , chromatic light - curve breaks , and sharp post - plateau decays .",
    "the model requires the existence of a long - lived engine that releases relativistic ejecta for at least 10 ks or some other way of producing a relativistic outflow that has such a radial spread . that the scattering outflow has a higher lorentz factor than the forward shock",
    "need not be a feature of the engine and could be just the consequence of the deceleration that the forward shock undergoes as it sweeps - up and energizes the ambient medium .",
    "the requirement that the scattering outflow is pair - rich is to ensure a sufficiently large ( sub - unity ) optical thickness to electron scattering , so that the scattered emission can overshine the forward - shock s direct emission and explain the above three features of x - ray afterglows .",
    "this requirement can be relaxed if the scattering outflow is hot ( by birth or due to internal shocks ) , so that the incident photons are also inverse - compton scattered ( in addition to their bulk up - scattering ) .    of the above - mentioned x - ray features ,",
    "only plateaus can be explained by the forward - shock model : energy injection in this shock by means of some delayed ejecta should lead to a slower decay of the forward - shock emission .",
    "however , the other three features ( flares , chromatic breaks , and sharp post - plateau fall - offs ) can not be accounted for by the forward - shock model , where fluctuation timescales are expected to be of order of the afterglow age and the multiwavelength light - curve behaviours should be well coupled .",
    "the light - curves for the scattered forward - shock emission shown in figure ( [ eg ] ) show that this model can account for the sharpness and brightness of the flares observed in many x - ray afterglows .",
    "the dynamics of sweeping - up the photons left behind by the forward shock leads to flares of duration @xmath212 , with @xmath3 and @xmath14 the forward - shock lorentz factor at observer time @xmath26 and @xmath14 that of the scatterer .",
    "this @xmath127 is also the spread in the photon - arrival time caused by the spherical curvature of the scattering surface : @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is the radius of the scatterer when it catches - up with the forward shock",
    ". therefore , very short flares are a natural feature of the scattered emission , provided that the radial spread of the scattering outflow is sufficiently small ( instantaneous ejection ) . for longer - lived flares , the shape of the flare ( fast - rise , fast - fall , or symmetric flares ) depends on the radial distribution of the mass - flux @xmath119 and/or of the lorentz factor @xmath118 in the scattering outflow ( figure [ eg ] ) .",
    "figure [ betalc ] illustrates that x - ray plateaus ( as observed for most afterglows ) can result from scattering the forward - shock emission . because the up - scattered emission is more likely to overshine the direct forward - shock emission at higher photon energies than at lower energies",
    ", this model can also produce chromatic plateaus and breaks , which appear in the x - rays but not in the optical as well ( figure [ plateau ] ) .",
    "such chromatic x - ray breaks are observed for several grb afterglows .",
    "sharp decays following x - ray plateaus , as observed for a few grb afterglows , result if the @xmath119 or @xmath118 of the scattering outflow decrease sufficiently fast at some point behind the forward shock ( i.e. the scattering outflow has a well - defined trailing edge ) .",
    "only a few xrt afterglows display a sharp post - plateau decay , the norm being that of a smooth transition to a steeper power - law decay .",
    "this requires scattering outflows with a more complex structure , where the plateau end corresponds to a change in the radial distribution of @xmath119 and/or @xmath118 . that most post - plateau x - ray light - curves have a slow decay indicates that the radial distributions of @xmath119 and @xmath118 ( equation [ mg ] ) are not far from being uniform and that they rarely exhibit the fast decrease with distance from the forward - shock that is required by the minority of x - ray afterglows with sharp post - plateau decays .",
    "for a scattering outflow of lorentz factor well above that of the forward shock , the arrival time of the scattered photons is nearly equal to the delay ( in the lab frame ) between the ejection of the forward - shock driving ejecta and the scattering fluid .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "_ first _ , in addition to the spectral slope of the forward - shock emission , the scattered flux received at an observer time @xmath26 reflects the properties ( @xmath119 and @xmath118 ) of the scattering fluid ejected at lab - frame time @xmath215 .",
    "this implies that a variety of x - ray plateau decays and shapes can be obtained by choosing the right functions for @xmath119 and @xmath118 ( equations [ f1 ] , [ f0 ] , [ f2 ] , and [ f3 ] ) .",
    "second _ is that a flare seen at time @xmath26 or a plateau lasting until @xmath26 require that the central engine operates at / until a lab - frame time equal to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the scattering - outflow model for x - ray flares and plateaus is still based on the existence of a long - lived engine , as is the internal - shock interpretation of flares .",
    "the post - plateau decay of swift x - ray afterglows is generally compatible with a forward - shock origin ( see fig . 5 of willingale et al 2007 , fig .",
    "11 of panaitescu 2007 , fig",
    ". 6 of liang et al 2007 ) .",
    "however , no single variant of that model that can account for the spread of post - plateau decay indices for a given spectral slope .",
    "furthermore , for a set of 60 swift afterglows , we find that the post - plateau x - ray decay index is not correlated with the spectral slope ( linear correlation coefficient @xmath216 ) , contrary to what is expected for the forward - shock emission .    that lack of correlation is a natural consequence of the scattering model , where the post - plateau decay is determined not only by the spectral slope of the forward - shock seed photons but also by the radial distribution of @xmath119 and/or @xmath118 in the scattering outflow . a stronger argument in favour of this model for x - ray afterglows is that it can explain two features ( chromatic light - curve breaks and sharp post - plateau decays ) that can not be accounted for by the forward - shock model .",
    "however , about 30 percent of the well - monitored x - ray afterglows of willingale ( 2007 ) do not have a plateau , thus their emission need not be attributed to a scattering outflow , and could originate in the forward shock .",
    "furthermore , the grb afterglows 051109a ( yost et al 2007 ) , 060614 ( mangano et al 2007a ) , 060714 ( krimm et al 2007 ) , and 060729 ( grupe et al 2007 ) display an achromatic break , which is seen simultaneously in the optical and x - ray light - curves .",
    "such breaks require that both emissions arise from the same mechanism .",
    "although that could be achieved by the scattering outflow model , provided that the forward - shock emission peaks at a sufficiently low energy that the scattered flux is dominant also in the optical , it seems more natural to attribute the achromatic breaks at plateau ends to the cessation of energy injection into the forward shock .",
    "the forward - shock is also a more plausible origin for the long - lived , power - law x - ray afterglows of e.g. grb 050416a ( mangano et al 2007b ) , grb 050822 ( godet et al 2007 ) , grb 060319 ( burrows & racusin 2007 ) grb 060729 , which , in the scattering outflow model , would require a central engine producing a scattering outflow with a nearly uniform distribution of @xmath119 and @xmath14 over very long times ( @xmath217 ms in source frame ) .    therefore , the features of optical and x - ray afterglow light - curves provide evidence in favour of both the forward - shock and scattering - outflow models . when the forward - shock emission is the brightest , the x - ray afterglow may lack a plateau or , if it has one owing to energy injection in the blast - wave , then the plateau ends with an achromatic break .",
    "if the scattered emission is dominant , then the x - ray afterglow exhibits a plateau , most likely ending with a chromatic break .",
    "this picture is supported by that x - ray afterglows without plateaus are harder ( figure [ a2b2 ] ) , as a harder forward - shock emission is expected to be brighter and , thus , more likely to overshine the scattered emission .",
    "thus , the observed diversity of swift x - ray afterglows is due to both mechanisms being at work , in addition to the diversity that each model can produce on its own .",
