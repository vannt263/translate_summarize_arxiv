    "in 2003 babar collaboration discovered a positive - parity scalar charm strange meson @xmath0 with a very narrow width @xcite , which was confirmed by cleo collaboration @xcite and belle collaboration @xcite later .",
    "this observed state has attracted much attention because its measured mass and width do not match the predictions from potential - based quark models @xcite . to resolve the difficulties ,",
    "many theoretical models have appeared in the literature .",
    "various theoretical models , based on the @xmath1 quark structure , are suggested to explain the low mass and the narrow width for the @xmath0 meson @xcite-@xcite .",
    "qcd sum rule analysis in @xcite , @xcite supports the @xmath1 postulation of nature @xmath0 .",
    "apart from the quark - antiquark interpretation , this state has been interpreted as a @xmath3 molecule @xcite , a @xmath4 molecule @xcite , a @xmath5 four - quark state @xcite , and a mixing of the conventional state and the four - quark state @xcite .",
    "also this state was investigated in the framework of chiral symmetry considerations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we assume @xmath0 meson as the @xmath1 state and study its parameters at finite temperature using qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the extending of qcd sum rules method to finite temperature has been made in the paper @xcite .",
    "this extension based on two basic assumptions , that the operator product expansion ( ope ) and notion of quark - hadron duality remain valid at finite temperature , but the vacuum condensates must be replaced by their thermal expectation values .",
    "the thermal qcd sum rule has been extensively used for studying thermal properties of both light and heavy mesons as a reliable and well - established method @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we calculated the temperature behavior of mass and leptonic decay constant of @xmath0 meson .",
    "the knowledge of leptonic decay constants is needed to predict numerous heavy flavor electroweak transitions and to determine standard model parameters from the experimental data .",
    "also leptonic decay constants play essential role in the analysis of ckm matrix , cp violation and the mixings @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we calculated the annihilation and scattering parts of spectral density and give the expression for the perturbative scalar spectral function up to two - loop order @xmath2 corrections . also nonperturbative contributions up to the dimension six condensates",
    "@xcite are summarized .",
    "section 3 contains our numerical analysis of the mass and leptonic decay constant using borel transform sum rules .",
    "the starting point for the sum rule analysis is the two - point thermal correlator @xmath8 where @xmath9 is heavy - light quark current and has the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are charm and strange quark masses respectively .",
    "@xmath12 quark mass is not neglected throughout this work .",
    "thermal average of any operator _",
    "o _ is determined by following way @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the qcd hamiltonian , and @xmath15 stands for the inverse of the temperature @xmath16 and traces carry out over any complete set of states . according to the basic idea of the qcd sum rule",
    ", we must calculate this correlator in terms of the physical particles ( hadrons ) and in quark - gluon language , and then equate both representations .",
    "first let us calculate theoretical part of the correlator eq .",
    "( 1 ) . up to a subtraction polynomial , which depends on the large @xmath17 behavior",
    ", @xmath18 satisfies following dispersion relation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is spectral density . in order to calculate two - point thermal correlator in the lowest order of perturbation theory",
    "we use quark propagator at finite temperature @xcite @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath23^{-1}$ ] and @xmath24 . after some calculations we find that perturbative part of spectral density is given by @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that spectral density involves two pieces , one is called the annihilation term , @xmath28 , which survives at @xmath29 . other term is called scattering term , @xmath30 , which vanishes at @xmath29 .",
    "as can be seen , delta function @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) gives the first branch cut , @xmath32 , which coincides with zero temperature cut and describes the standard threshold for particle decays . on the other hand , delta function @xmath33 in eq.(5 )",
    "shows that an additional branch cut arises at finite temperature , @xmath34 , and this new branch cut corresponds to particle absorption from the medium .",
    "therefore , delta functions @xmath31 and @xmath33 in eq.(5 ) contribute in regions @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "taking into account these contributions the annihilation and scattering parts of spectral density in the case @xmath37 can be written as @xmath38 } , \\\\\\ ] ] @xmath39 } , \\\\\\ ] ] here @xmath40 is the correlation function in the lowest order of perturbation theory at zero temperature and given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "note that in @xmath2 corrections terms the strange quark mass is set zero , though in numerical analysis , the mass of the strange quark is taken account .",
    "the subtraction terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are removed by using the borel transformation , therefore we will omit these terms .",

    "( 11 ) @xmath50 , @xmath51 and terms are organized according to their dimension .",
    "it is assumed , that the expansion ( 11 ) also remains valid , but the vacuum condensates must be replaced by their thermal expectation values @xcite .",

    "our next task is the calculation of the physical part of the correlator ( 1 ) . according to the basic idea of quark - hadron duality assumption , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be evaluated in a hadron - based picture .",
    "equating ope and hadron representations of correlation function and using quark - hadron duality the central equation of our sum - rule analysis takes the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the leptonic decay constant and mass of @xmath0 meson respectively .",
