    "since the discovery of a new phase of matter in @xmath0 = 200 agev heavy ion collisions @xcite , the goal of the high energy nuclear physics community is now the quantitative determination of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "for instance , is the medium produced at rhic and lhc a weakly - coupled gas of the quarks and gluons of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lagrangian or perhaps a strongly coupled fluid made up of emergent collective degrees of freedom , and how does this description change as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and centrality ?",
    "high momentum particles provide the most direct probe of the soft momentum modes present in the qgp created in heavy ion collisions ( see @xcite and references therein ) . extracting information about the fundamental properties of the qgp",
    "requires a comparison between theoretical calculations and experimental data . despite its great promise , to date",
    "no one energy loss model has provided a consistent picture of the different relevant observables , such as and , as a function of particle mass , @xmath6 , centrality , and @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate here that calculations based on the whdg energy loss model @xcite  which is itself based on weak - coupling , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods  provide a reasonably good , qualitatively consistent description of the preliminary data on the suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of light hadrons and the suppression of @xmath2 mesons as a function of @xmath6 and centrality at lhc when constrained by a rigorous statistical analysis of central rhic @xmath1 suppression data @xcite . on the other hand , calculations based on the strong - coupling techniques in an ads / cft heavy quark drag model appear to significantly overpredict the central values of the preliminary @xmath2 meson suppression when qualitatively constrained to the non - photonic electron data from rhic @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainties related to this heavy meson measurement are quite large , and currently the strong - coupling calculation does not appear to be falsified .",
    "a generic energy loss calculation requires a convolution of a hard production spectrum followed by the in - medium energy loss and a fragmentation function . in whdg @xcite",
    ", the parton is allowed to lose energy perturbatively through both elastic and inelastic processes in a realistically described , 1d bjorken - expanding medium .",
    "the radiative energy loss equations were found via the use of standard feynman diagram techniques @xcite , making sure to take into account the crucial fact that the parton is created at a finite time .",
    "it is important to note that even at top lhc energies , we find elastic energy loss @xcite provides a sizable ( @xmath725% ) fraction of the total energy loss @xcite . using thermal field theory to relate density to temperature and temperature to the debye mass and",
    "mean free path in a qgp , in whdg the only free parameter becomes the medium gluon density @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 fixed and geometry set by the colliding nuclei ) .",
    "as in @xcite , in this work we assume that the medium density scales precisely with the measured charged particle multiplicity , @xmath10 .",
    "we use the rigorous statistical comparison @xcite of whdg predictions as a function of @xmath8 at @xmath11 agev to rhic data to set the proportionality constant between @xmath8 and @xmath10 . with",
    "the published @xmath10 data from alice @xcite , and continuing to keep @xmath9 fixed , we can compute all observables at lhc _ using no free parameters_. a sample of such zero parameter predictions is shown in and . the prediction associated with the best fit value of the medium density",
    "is denoted by a dashed line ; the one - sigma uncertainty associated with that best fit parameter extraction is denoted by a band . in ( a )",
    "we demonstrate a good qualitative agreement of the normalization and momentum dependence between the preliminary cms @xmath12 data @xcite and @xmath13 predictions from whdg @xcite ; quantitatively , the calculations overpredict the suppression by , at worst , somewhat more than a standard deviation . in ( b ) and",
    "( c ) we show that the whdg calculations are in excellent quantitative agreement with the preliminary atlas measurements @xcite at several centrality bins .",
    "in ( a ) we again see excellent agreement between the whdg predictions of @xmath2 meson suppression and the preliminary alice data @xcite within the stated uncertainties .",
    "we provide for future reference whdg predictions at @xmath14 atev of @xmath3 meson suppression in ( b ) and also of the double ratio of @xmath15 in ( c ) .",
    "note the rapid convergence of the pqcd - based predictions to unity in ( c ) .",

    "it was seen in @xcite that these strong coupling techniques yield a model whose suppression of non - photonic electrons at @xmath11 agev is in both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the data taken at rhic . again assuming that the medium density scales with observed charged particle multiplicity and keeping all other parameters the same produces the ads / cft drag curves shown in ( a)-(c ) .",
    "the three ads / cft drag curves shown explore part of the possible parameter space associated with linking qcd parameters to those in @xmath17 sym @xcite .",
    "clearly the drag predictions quantitatively overpredict the suppression of @xmath2 mesons compared to the preliminary alice data @xcite ; however , due to the large uncertainties in that data , the theoretical calculation can not currently be claimed to be falsified .",
    "future distinguishing measurements include very different -dependencies for @xmath3 meson suppression and for the double ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "both of these quantities increase as a function of momentum for pqcd - based calculations . on the other hand",
    ", ads / cft drag - based calculations robustly predict a decrease of @xmath19 as a function of and a near -independence of the double ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "one must note that these drag calculations are performed in @xmath17 sym , not qcd , and in the limit that @xmath20 and large @xmath21 .",
    "additionally the drag calculations assume that the quark mass is very large compared to the temperature of the plasma , an assumption that may not hold particularly well for the charm quark . finally , there is a known upper - bound to the velocity of the heavy quark for which the ads / cft derivations are applicable @xcite . this upper limit is mass- , @xmath21- , and temperature - dependent .",
    "we give an indication of where corrections to the lowest - order ads / cft calculations may set in ( at the highest temperature , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the thermalization time ) with an `` ( '' on the relevant curves in ( a)-(c ) and where corrections almost certainly set ( at the lowest temperature @xmath24 mev ) in with an `` ] '' .    @xmath25{dmesonsi.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=1.8in]{braab.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=1.8in]{dtobraae.eps } \\\\[-.1 in ] \\qquad\\mbox{\\footnotesize(a ) } & \\qquad\\mbox{\\footnotesize(b ) } & \\qquad\\mbox{\\footnotesize(c ) } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "at rhic kinematics , no energy loss calculation provided a consistent picture of the multiple observables reported @xcite .",
    "in particular , constraining pqcd - based calculations to @xmath1 suppression led to a qualitative underprediction of the @xmath26 gev / c@xmath27 @xcite and a quantitative underprediction of non - photonic electron suppression @xcite .",
    "however , constrained to rhic data , we find the pqcd - based whdg energy loss calculation qualitatively describes the light hadron suppression and quantitatively describes the azimuthal anisotropy and heavy meson suppression at lhc , using _ no free parameters_. nevertheless , one must be cautious in these comparisons to data as there are a large number of theoretical uncertainties that are not yet taken into account in the whdg  nor fully in any other pqcd - based energy loss ",
    "model : higher order effects in opacity @xcite , coupling @xcite , heavy quark mass ( divided by parton energy ) @xcite , collinearity @xcite ; initial conditions @xcite ; energy loss in confined matter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the heavy quark drag calculations appear to oversuppress the @xmath2 mesons compared to the central values of the data , although the results are not completely inconsistent with the data within the current , large experimental uncertainties .",
    "similar to the perturbative calculations , there are many theoretical uncertainties in the drag calculations that should give one pause when comparing to experimental data ; for instance the derivations were performed in @xmath17 sym @xcite and higher order corrections from , e.g. , loops and quark mass to plasma temperature @xcite have not yet been taken in to account .",
    "we look forward to the future measurements of @xmath3 meson suppression and the double ratio of @xmath18 at lhc which will help distinguish between the energy loss mechanics dominant in heavy ion collisions ."
