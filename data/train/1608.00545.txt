    "this model realizes a magnon analog of haldane model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this model also exhibits thermal hall effect of spin excitations @xcite , as well as spin nernst effect @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "honeycomb ferromagnets are equivalent to antiferromagnetic counterparts by flipping the spins on one sublattice . although the ground state properties of both systems are the same , their magnon bands are different . generally speaking ,",
    "ferromagnets are characterized by quadratic goldstone modes , whereas antiferromagnets exhibit linear goldstone modes .",
    "the honeycomb antiferromagnets with a staggered nnn dmi amount to flipping the sign of the exchange coupling , say @xmath2 , in the ferromagnets @xcite . however , the magnon bands of both systems are topologically distinct as one would expect . at zero magnetic field ,",
    "symmetry guarantees that magnon dispersion of honeycomb antiferromagnets are doubly degenerate between the @xmath3 sectors forming the nel states .",
    "the staggered dmi is unable to lift this degeneracy and magnon hall response vanishes due to zero net magnetic moment , but magnon spin nernst response persists @xcite .",
    "this interesting result can be understood by going back to similar effect in electronic systems . in this case ,",
    "quantum spin hall effect @xcite corresponds to two copies of quantum anomalous hall effect @xcite . while the latter breaks time - reversal symmetry , the former is time - reversal invariant .",
    "a striking feature of these two systems is that the anomalous hall response vanishes in time - reversal invariant systems , whereas quantum spin hall response persists @xcite . in a similar manner",

    "the question we ask is : does vanishing magnon hall response persist in the canted nel state ?",

    "there are numerous studies of ground state properties of honeycomb antiferromagnets applicable to the material bi@xmath6mn@xmath7o@xmath8(no@xmath6 ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study experimentally accessible thermal hall effect of magnetic spin excitations in honeycomb antiferromagnets with symmetry breaking nnn dmi .",
    "we will also include a nnn symmetric heisenberg interaction to generalize our study to field - induced nel states in frustrated honeycomb lattice . in any case , the presence of a magnetic field along the out - of - plane @xmath11-axis in spin space results in spin canting .",
    "therefore , the spin components are nonzero along the out - of - plane and in - plane directions . for this reason , both",
    "the out - of - plane dmi @xmath12 and in - plane dmi @xmath13 contribute to thermal hall response .",
    "we find that the hall response is nonzero in both cases .",
    "these results suggest an experimental procedure to search for thermal hall response of spin excitations in two - dimensional bipartite honeycomb antiferromagnets .",
    "we consider the model hamiltonian for honeycomb antiferromagnets subject to a magnetic field along the out - of - plane direction .",
    "the model is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction , @xmath16 is a next - nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction , @xmath17 is a staggered dmi vector between sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 , allowed by the nnn triangular plaquettes on the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath20 .",
    "the last term is the zeeman field in units of @xmath21 .",

    "however , the size of the spin is not necessary for observing magnon hall response in magnetic systems .    in the absence of the dmi , this model as been extensively investigated in the context of ground state properties @xcite . in these works",
    ", it has been established that an out - of - plane magnetic field induces a canted nel order for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for spin-@xmath22 the parameter range of @xmath25 is much smaller than @xmath26 approximately @xmath27 in units of @xmath2 @xcite . throughout the analysis in this paper we set @xmath28 as the unit of energy and",
    "take @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "a fully polarized ferromagnet is recovered for @xmath31 .",
    "the effects of the nnn dmi has not be considered at nonzero magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted that the dmi does not change the canted nel state because the lattice is bipartite , ordered magnetically and the nnn sites have a triangular geometry .",

    "we are interested in the low temperature regime of this model . in this regime ,",
    "the excitations are magnons in the ordered state . in the classical limit",
    ", the spin operators can be approximated as classical vectors , written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a unit vector and @xmath41 labels the spin oriented angles on each sublattice with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 label the sublattices and @xmath38 is the field - induced canting angle as shown in fig .",

    "the classical energy is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total number of sites .",
    "minimizing the classical energy yields the canting angle @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "for the excitations above this classical ground states , we first rotate the coordinate axes such that the @xmath11-axis coincides with the local direction of the classical polarization @xcite . the appropriate rotation on the two sublattices is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 applies to sublattices @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "next , we employ the linearized holstein primakoff transformation and perform fourier transform into momentum space as shown in appendix  [ appena ] .",
    "there are few points to be noted .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is bipartite and the canted nel state is ordered .",
    "in contrast to collinear ferromagnetic systems @xcite , the nel order is not along the field direction but along the direction perpendicular to the field .",
    "this can be understood geometrically as a canted straight line can be resolved in two directions .",
    "the components of the spins along the field direction ( i.e out - of - plane ) form a weak ( canted ) ferromagnet , whereas the components of the spins perpendicular the field direction ( i.e in - plane ) form a canted nel state . now",
    ", we are used to the conception that the dmi must be out - of - plane as in kagom ferromagnets @xcite . actually , the correct statement is that the dmi must be along the direction of the spin polarization in order to contribute to the magnon dispersion .",
    "the in - plane dmi does not contribute on the kagom ferromagnets because the spins are not polarized along this direction . in the absence of the magnetic field , one can always choose the quantization axis along the in - plane ( say @xmath52 ) direction and the dmi has to be along this direction to contribute to the dispersion at linear order in spin wave theory .",
    "thus , it boils down to a rotation of axis provided there is no magnetic field that polarizes the spins along its direction .",
    "this is true in all ferromagnets on any lattice . in the kagom antferromagnets ,",
    "specifically the coplanar @xmath53 ordering the above argument does not apply , because the dmi induces this magnetic ordering in sharp contrast to kagom ferromagnets . however , not all directions of the dmi permits the @xmath53 ordering .",
    "therefore , the direction of the dmi is very crucial in non - bipartite antiferromagnets .",
    "the present model behaves more like ferromagnets because the lattice is bipartite and the magnetic ordering is not induced by the dmi .",
    "this is clearly exemplified in appendix a. what happens in the present model is that the out - of - plane dmi ( @xmath54 with @xmath55 ) contribute to the components of the spins along the field direction and the in - plane dmi ( @xmath56 with @xmath57 ) contribute to the component of the spins perpendicular to the field direction . in the former , @xmath58 ,",
    "whereas @xmath59 in the latter , where @xmath60 applies to sublattices @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the sign change in the latter shows that nel order is along this direction .",
    "this sign change is cancelled by @xmath61 as can be seen in eq .",
    "[ a6 ] of appendix a. at zero magnetic field , @xmath62 , the collinear nel order is along the @xmath52-axis and @xmath63 . on the other hand , at the saturation field @xmath64 there is no nel order and @xmath65 .",
    "this clearly shows that the dmi must be along the direction of spin polarization in bipartite lattices and ferromagnets in non - bipartite lattices . because of the different nature of the magnetic ordering along the in - plane and out - of - plane direction the magnon dispersions are different .",
    "the hamiltonians are separately diagonalized in appendix  [ appena ] .",
    "figures [ band1 ] and [ band2 ] show the magnon dispersions and the corresponding zigzag magnon edge states of the system with out - of - plane and in - plane dmis respectively , and several values of the magnetic field .",
    "as noted above , at @xmath66 the spins form collinear nel order in the @xmath52-@xmath67 plane , and the out - of - plane dmi obviously vanishes .",
    "hence , only the dmi along , say @xmath52-quantization axis contributes in this case . at @xmath68",
    "there is a single edge state at the outermost band between @xmath69 and @xmath70 as shown fig .",
    "[ band1 ] . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ band2 ] shows the zigzag edge states at @xmath68 with nonzero dmi along the quantization axis , i.e. , @xmath71 . in this case",
    ", the dmi does not introduce additional zigzag edge state but simply leads to asymmetry of the bulk bands . in the canted phase , @xmath72",
    ", both components of the dmi have a finite contribution .",
    "we see that counter - propagating edge states exist for @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ band1 ] ( with a chern number of @xmath74 ) , whereas single edge state persists with @xmath71 as shown in fig .",

    "since the diagonal magnon band comprises @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we have added the two contributions as they are not equal to each other .",
    "for this zero field case , the contribution from the dmi ( mass ) term cancels out and the result is that the transverse thermal hall conductivity vanishes , @xmath122 , even for @xmath78 .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of time - reversal symmetry at zero field , which is analogous to the vanishing of quantum anomalous hall conductivity in kane - mele model @xcite . in analogy to nonzero spin hall conductivity in kane - mele model @xcite",
    ", the magnon spin nernst conductivity persists @xcite .",
    "another way to understand vanishing thermal hall response at zero field is that the net magnetic moment is zero for collinear antiferromagnets on bipartite lattices .",

    ". the similarity of @xmath126 between the field - induced nel order and collinear ferromagnetic system @xcite can be understood on the grounds of bipartite lattices .",
    "in fact , the temperature dependence of @xmath126 seems to be similar in various systems .",
    "for instance , the observed low temperature dependence of @xmath126 in kagom ferromagnet cu(1 - 3 , bdc)@xcite has a similar trend to recently observed temperature dependence of @xmath126 in frustrated kagom volborthite cu@xmath6v@xmath0o@xmath1(oh)@xmath0 @xmath1332h@xmath0o @xcite .",
