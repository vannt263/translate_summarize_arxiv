    "in the last decade there has been a constant interest in the transport properties of the periodically modulated two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . in particular ,",
    "in the presence of a lateral modulation of a one - dimensional character the resistivity may be strongly anisotropic , which essentially reflects the anisotropy of the electronic states .",
    "two types of modulations can be achieved in the experimental devices : electrostatic potential modulations @xcite and , more recently , magnetic field modulations .",
    "@xcite weak modulations of both types lead already to pronounced magnetoresistance effects in the presence of an average magnetic field @xmath0 applied perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "these effects occur at low and intermediate @xmath0 values , well below the magnetic quantum regime where shubnikov - de haas oscillations appear . at very small values of @xmath0 a pronounced positive magnetoresistance",
    "is observed , followed at intermediate @xmath0 values by the `` weiss oscillations '' due to commensurability effects .",
    "both effects are adequately understood within a classical transport calculation based on boltzmann s equation , and can be traced back to the predominance of different types of classical trajectories .",
    "@xcite    the positive magnetoresistance is understood as caused by `` channeled orbits '' which exist if the modulation is sufficiently strong or , equivalently , the average magnetic field is sufficiently small . for electric modulation",
    "they occur near the minima of the modulation potential ( `` open '' orbits @xcite ) , and for magnetic modulation near the lines of vanishing total magnetic field ( `` snake '' orbits @xcite ) .",
    "they are always confined within a single period of the modulation , which we choose in @xmath1 direction .",
    "they are wavy trajectories allowing for fast motion of electrons with velocities within small angles around the direction of translational invariance ( @xmath2 direction ) .",
    "these channeled orbits occur in addition to the `` drifting orbits '' , which are self - intersecting trajectories with loops ( along each of which the direction of the velocity changes by @xmath3 ) , so that usually a low drift velocity in @xmath2 direction results . for sufficiently small @xmath0 ,",
    "drifting orbits may extend over many periods of the modulation . at sufficiently large @xmath0 ( sufficiently small modulation amplitudes )",
    "only the drifting orbits survive .",
    "the `` weiss oscillations '' manifest a commensurability effect depending on the ratio of the extent of drifting orbits ( at the fermi energy ) and the modulation period . with increasing modulation strength ,",
    "the positive magnetoresistance becomes more pronounced and extends to larger @xmath0 values , suppressing progressively the low-@xmath0 weiss oscillations.@xcite this effect is well understood within the classical calculation @xcite , if both types of trajectories are adequately included , and it has recently also been obtained by a quantum calculation for a strong modulation @xcite .",
    "a qualitatively new type of magnetoresistance effect has recently been observed by ye _",
    "et al._@xcite on samples with an extremely strong magnetic modulation .",
    "samples with a surface array of ferromagnetic micro - strips were measured in tilted magnetic fields , so that the applied magnetic field had a large component parallel to the surface , producing a large magnetization of the ferromagnetic strips , while only the small perpendicular component determined the average magnetic field @xmath0 in the 2deg . in this way a huge positive magnetoresistance with superimposed shubnikov - de haas like oscillations was obtained at low values of the average magnetic field , at which no magnetic quantum effects should be expected for weak modulation.@xcite it rather seems that the quantum oscillations are induced by the large - amplitude periodic magnetic modulation field .",
    "such conditions require a quantum transport theory and , as a first step , the understanding of the quantum electronic states of a 2deg with a strong magnetic modulation .",
    "this is the motivation of the present work",
    ".    channeled and drifting quantum states in linearly varying magnetic field are already discussed by other authors .",
    "@xcite the schrdinger equation for periodic magnetic fields alternating in sign , has been solved previously , but only for the case when the average field is zero @xcite . in the present paper we shall study the quantum electronic states in strong periodic magnetic fields with a non - vanishing average , and compare it with the case of a strong electric modulation . in both situations ,",
    "rather complicated energy spectra are obtained , with striking qualitative similarities and quantitative differences . for the case of strong electric modulation",
    ", such a complicated energy spectrum has recently been published @xcite , but without an attempt of an explanation .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that a close comparison with classical motion leads to a detailed and intuitive understanding of these spectra and the corresponding eigenstates .    in sec .",
    "ii we start with some general remarks on the relation between quantum and classical description of the 2d electron motion in 1d lateral superlattices , and we introduce suitable reduced units . in sec .",
    "iii we focus on the effect of a simple harmonic magnetic modulation of arbitrary strength . in sec .",
    "iv we include an electric modulation , which requires a somewhat different analytical procedure .",
    "the inclusion of electric modulation seems also necessary from the experimental point of view , since the ferromagnetic strips on the sample surface introduce a periodic stress field in the sample , which acts as an electric modulation on the 2deg . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize the essential features derived in the paper and extend the discussion beyond the model of simple harmonic modulations .",
    "some of the present results have been recently published in a preliminary form.@xcite",
    "we consider a ( non - interacting ) 2des in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane subjected to a magnetic field with @xmath4 component @xmath5 and an electrostatic field in @xmath1 direction leading to a potential energy @xmath6 .",
    "our aim is a close comparison of the classical and the quantum description of the electron motion ( in terms of orbits and wavefunctions , respectively ) in such fields , especially in the case that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are periodic in @xmath1 with the same period @xmath8 and vanishing average values .    to evidence the translation invariance in @xmath2 direction in the ( either classical or quantum ) hamiltonian @xmath9 we describe @xmath10 by an @xmath1-dependent vector potential @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "we use the equation @xmath29 , which may also be derived directly from newton s equation , to eliminate the velocity @xmath30 . the effective motion in @xmath1 direction",
    "is determined by @xmath31 .",
    "similar to the wavefunctions , the orbits for given constants of motion , @xmath27 and @xmath32 , are bounded in @xmath1 direction , however the energy @xmath32 is a continuous variable . for a given @xmath33 , each position @xmath1 ( with @xmath34 ) is the turning point of two orbits which are characterized by the center coordinates @xcite @xmath35 obtained from @xmath36 for @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the cyclotron radius of electrons moving with energy @xmath39 in the magnetic field @xmath0 . for given @xmath40 and @xmath27 ,",

    "this allows a convenient classification of the possible orbits at fixed energy @xmath40 and for varying @xmath27.@xcite of course , the same classification can also be done by directly investigating the effective potential .",
    "this may be preferred if one is interested in orbits at different energies but the same @xmath27 .",
    "the calculation of the orbits is a simple textbook problem , but must in general be done numerically . in accordance with the translational symmetry of the problem , we will in the following",
    "not distinguish orbits which differ only by a rigid shift in @xmath2 direction .",
    "if an electron is at time @xmath42 at position @xmath43 on an orbit characterized by the constants of motion @xmath40 and @xmath27 , with turning points @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , it moves towards one of the turning points so that at time @xmath47 it is at position @xmath48 , with @xmath49 where @xmath50[x_0-x^-_0(x)]}$ ] and @xmath51 $ ] . if at one of the turning points @xmath44 or @xmath45 , where @xmath52 , the derivative @xmath53 vanishes , we call this turning point and this orbit `` critical '' . at critical",

    "( [ veff ] ) , has the symmetry @xmath60 . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy spectrum is also periodic , @xmath61 , and can be restricted to the `` first brillouin zone '' @xmath62 .",
    "the eigenfunctions can be taken to satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding classical symmetry is that an orbit characterized by @xmath40 and @xmath64 differs from that characterized by @xmath40 and @xmath27 only by a rigid shift of amount @xmath8 in @xmath1 direction .",
    "the dispersion of the energy bands @xmath28 implies a group velocity in @xmath2 direction , @xmath65 which is the expectation value of the velocity operator in the energy eigenstate @xmath66 .",
    "it is the quantum equivalent to the classical drift velocity , i.e.  the average velocity ( in @xmath2 direction ) along the corresponding classical orbit .",
    "the drift velocity in @xmath1 direction vanishes , since the orbits are bounded in @xmath1 direction .      for an economic comparison of classical and quantum aspects it is important to use suitable length and energy units , which are meaningful for both the quantum description and the classical limit .",
    "doing so , we will see that the classical features depend on fewer scaled parameters than the quantum ones . to be specific but still rather general ,",
    "we assume in the following periodic modulations of the form @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the magnetic and the electric modulation , respectively , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are dimensionless periodic functions with period @xmath3 and vanishing average values .",
    "thus @xmath7 and @xmath6 have the same period @xmath71 , but may have different shapes and phases . in the numerical examples we will use for both @xmath69 and @xmath72 simple cosines , eventually with a phase shift .",
    "the average magnetic field @xmath0 sets , with the magnetic length @xmath73 and the cyclotron energy @xmath74 , both a length and an energy scale , which are useful for quantum calculations , but have no meaning for the classical motion .",
    "for the discussion of commensurability effects , such as the weiss oscillations , the cyclotron orbits must be compared with the period @xmath8 of the modulation .",
    "therefore @xmath8 is a natural choice for the lengths unit .",
    "the choice of a suitable energy unit is motivated as follows .",
    "classically , @xmath0 determines only the cyclotron frequency @xmath75 , and one needs an independent length @xmath76 to define an energy scale @xmath77 . using @xmath76 as length unit , we may define dimensionless variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "the results reduce to those of the pure magnetic modulation , apart from some peculiarities at very low energies , where additional regions of channeled orbits may exist .    in magnetically modulated systems prepared by deposition of magnetic micro - strips",
    "there is always an induced electric modulation due to the interface stress between the ferromagnets and the semiconductor .",
    "@xcite the phase shift with respect to the magnetic modulation occurs when the external magnetic field is tilted.@xcite nevertheless , in the known experimental situations the stress potential amplitude is presumably much weaker than our bare potential .",
    "we have discussed in detail the quantum electronic states and energy spectra @xmath28 of a 2deg in strong one - dimensional magnetic and electric superlattices , and in a non - vanishing average external magnetic field . by comparing the quantum results with the corresponding characteristics of the classical motion , we achieved a detailed and intuitive understanding of the energy spectra and eigenstates .",
    "we found that the complicated parts of the energy spectra ( `` regions ii '' ) , where branches with strong dispersion coexist with those of low dispersion , coincide with the areas in the @xmath317 diagram in which classically `` channeled '' orbits exist .    for a systematic investigation of the possible energy spectra and eigen states , and of the corresponding types of classical trajectories , it is useful to exploit the scaling properties of the hamiltonian",
    ". then it is not necessary to vary independently all the basic model paramaters , i.e.  the strengths @xmath318 and @xmath300 of magnetic and electric modulation , the modulation period @xmath8 , and the average magnetic field @xmath0 .",

    "this is illustrated by figs .",
    "[ s_2_spec](a ) and [ s_5_spec](a ) , for which the regions ii coincide .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that , in these energy and length units , the effective potential is invariant under the scaling transformation @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 and @xmath326 , for arbitrary positive @xmath327 and @xmath328 . to leave the quantum result exactly unchanged under a change of the four model parameters , one has to keep @xmath329 also unchanged",
    "this is because only with the restriction @xmath330 the kinetic energy operator is also independent of the scaling parameter @xmath327 [ see eq .",
    "( [ schroedinger ] ) ] .",
    "thus , in the suitable units , the exact quantum result depends only on _ three _ independent parameters instead of _ four _ , and the characteristic classical features depend only on _",
    "two_.    there is a close correspondence between the quantum states belonging to strong - dispersion branches of the energy spectrum and the classical channeled orbits .",
    "these orbits occur near lines of vanishing total magnetic field or near minima of the electric modulation potential and are restricted to individual side valleys of the effective potential .",
    "they are always restricted to a part of a single modulation period in @xmath1 direction and represent a fast motion along ( wavy ) lines without self - intersections in positive or negative @xmath2 direction .",
    "the corresponding quantum states are also essentially confined to the same space region and belong to energy branches with strong dispersion . at a given value of the constant of motion @xmath27 ,",
    "channeled orbits exist in energy intervals bounded by adjacent relative minima and maxima of the effective potential , defining bottom and top of the corresponding side valley . plotting these classically defined extrema versus @xmath27 , one obtains the boundaries of the regions ii of the quantum energy spectrum .",
    "classically , for each channeled orbit there exists a `` drifting '' orbit with the same constants of motion @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "these drifting orbits are self - intersecting trajectories which , for sufficiently large energy , extend over more than one modulation period in @xmath1 direction and drift slowly in @xmath2 direction .",
    "the corresponding quantum states belong to low - dispersion branches of the energy spectrum .",
    "quantum mechanically , the channeled states do not appear at exactly the same energies as the drifting states , and they usually have a larger energy spacing than the latter , since they are confined to a narrower effective potential well .    we have demonstrated these features by model calculations based on simple harmonic modulation fields .",
    "qualitatively the obtained results and the methods to derive them can easily be extended to more general modulation fields , containing higher harmonics .",
    "this will be necessary , if the distance of the 2deg from the sample surface is not much larger than the period of the surface structure creating the modulation.@xcite anharmonic effective modulation potentials may also result from non - linear screening effects , even if the bare modulation potential is harmonic.@xcite    we have also performed several additional calculations and consistency checks which are not documented in the main text .",
    "e.g. , we have checked the equivalence of classical drift velocity and quantum group velocity beyond the analytically accessible case of very weak modulation fields .",
    "for some examples with strong modulation , we evaluated the quantum mechanical group velocity along several energy bands @xmath28 and compared the result with the drift velocity of the corresponding classical trajectories with the same energy and @xmath27 values . for most parts of the bands the two velocities agreed perfectly .",
    "a systematic deviation was observed only in parameter regimes where the classical trajectories are close to critical orbits , which have no quantum analog . near the critical orbits the modulus of the classical drift velocity increases rather rapidly , whereas the quantum mechanical group velocity shows no anomaly .",
    "we have also extended the band structure calculations to very strong magnetic modulation ( @xmath331 ) . while at high energies a complicated superpositon of bands with steep and with flat dispersions , similar to that in fig .",
    "[ s_6_spec](a ) , was obtained , the bands at low energies tend to cluster into groups separated by relatively large gaps .",
    "the low - energy part of the spectrum was already reminiscent of the spectrum for vanishing average magnetic field , where one obtains a one - dimensional bloch energy spectrum for each value of @xmath332.@xcite    concerning previous and forthcoming transport calculations , we conclude from the close correspondence of the quantum and the classical approach , that at weak average magnetic fields the classical calculations are appropriate , provided the modulation fields are not too strong .",
    "for the very strong magnetic modulation mentioned in the introduction , it may however happen , that the energy level spacing of `` channeled orbits '' exceeds the thermal energy @xmath333 in a regime where @xmath334",
    ". then we would expect modulation induced quantum effects in the positive - magnetoresistance regime at low @xmath335 .",
