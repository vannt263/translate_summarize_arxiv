    "the tensor interaction in a nucleus is a rather elusive beast .",
    "there are no first - order contributions to the binding energy of a closed @xmath4 nucleus like @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 due to the tensor interaction . likewise , there are no first - order contributions to the single - particle energies for a closed @xmath4 shell plus or minus one nucleon",
    ". there are , however , important second - order contributions .    to see the effects of the tensor interaction in first order , the simplest thing to do is to go to systems with _ two _ quasi - particles .",
    "to this end , we will consider the following cases :    \\a ) 1p-1h system : the @xmath8=@xmath9 , @xmath10=0 and @xmath10=1 states in @xmath6 ,    \\b ) 2-hole system : the beta decay of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , and    \\c ) 2-particle system : the e2 and m1 moments of @xmath13 .",
    "for the above cases , we perform shell - model calculations first in a small space ( @xmath1 ) and then in larger spaces in which @xmath14 and sometimes even higher excitations are included .",
    "we employ brueckner reaction matrices @xmath0 @xcite calculated according to : @xmath15 using the method introduced in ref.@xcite . in the above equation , @xmath16 is the bare @xmath17 potential for which we adopt a new nijmegen local @xmath17 interaction ( nijmii ) @xcite ; @xmath18 is the one - body hamiltonian with @xmath19 chosen to be the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) potential @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the starting energy , which , for an initial two - particle state @xmath22 in the ladder diagrams , is taken to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 s are the ho single - particle energies , @xmath25 thus @xmath26 is the unperturbed energy of the initial two - particle state @xmath22 in the ladder diagrams .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 in eq.([es ] ) can be thought of as the interaction energy between the two particles .",
    "the reader is referred to ref.@xcite for a partial justification for using the prescription in eq.([es ] ) for the starting energy .",
    "note that such a state - dependent choice for @xmath21 leads to a non - hermitian @xmath0 matrix but the non - hermiticity is found to be small and we here use an average of @xmath0 and its hermitian conjugate , @xmath28 , as our effective interaction @xmath29 .",
    "for all the nuclei under consideration , we fix the basis parameter @xmath30 at 14 mev and the starting - energy parameter @xmath27 at -50 mev .    the pauli operator @xmath31 in eq.([g ] ) is defined to prevent the two nucleons from scattering into the intermediate states which are either occupied ( therefore pauli forbidden ) or inside the model space ( to avoid double counting ) .",
    "it is therefore related to the choice of the model space . as we increase the size of the model space , we enlarge the @xmath31=0 region to avoid double counting .",
    "we show in fig.1 , as an example , our definition of @xmath31 which is used to calculate the @xmath0 matrix for a full @xmath32-space calculation of @xmath6 .",
    "we cut off the `` wings '' at the edge of the @xmath33=8 major shell .",
    "we emphasize that in this work we have used different definitions of @xmath31 for different model spaces and/or nuclei .",
    "the matrix diagonalization are performed for the shell - model hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "kinetic energy and the last term ( with @xmath36 ) is added to remove the spurious effects of the c.m .",
    "motion from the low - lying states .",
    "we have not included the coulomb interaction .",
    "it should be pointed out that our calculations involve no phenomenological single - particle energies .",
    "these are implicitly generated from the two - body @xmath0 matrix elements as well as the one - body kinetic energy in the matrix diagonalization .",
    "we previously considered in some detail the isospin splitting of @xmath8=@xmath9 states in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we will here take the opportunity to discuss a few points .",
    "it was shown by blomquist and molinari @xcite and millener and kurath @xcite that without the tensor interaction , the energy difference @xmath37 between the @xmath8=@xmath38 , @xmath10=1 and @xmath8=@xmath38 , @xmath10=0 states in @xmath6 would be very small . experimentally , the @xmath8=@xmath38 , @xmath10=0 state is at 10.952 mev and the @xmath8=@xmath38 , @xmath10=1 is at 12.797 mev so that the value of @xmath37 is 1.845 mev .",
    "the results for @xmath37 using various model spaces , using the @xmath0 matrices derived from the nijmii potential , are given in table i.    in the @xmath39 1p-1h space , in which the dominant configuration is @xmath40 with small admixture of @xmath41 , the value of @xmath37 is too large , i.e. , 2.809 mev as compared to the experimental value of 1.845 mev .",
    "thus from this case one might deduce that the effective tensor interaction is too strong .",
    "the situation is not improved much when @xmath32 3p-3h configurations are included in the matrix diagonalization , i.e. , when , besides the @xmath39 1p-1h already there , we allow two additional nucleons to be excited from the @xmath42 shell to the @xmath43-@xmath44 shell .",
    "the splitting @xmath37 changes from 2.809 mev to 2.678 mev , see table i.    however , when @xmath32 2p-2h admixtures [ i.e. , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are introduced , the situation improves dramatically : @xmath37 goes down to 1.641 mev .",
    "this number is in better agreement with experiment but we have an overshoot .",
    "when we furthermore include @xmath32 1p-1h configurations [ i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 to make our model space complete for a full @xmath49 calculation , the splitting becomes 1.931 mev , in very good agreement with to experiment .",
    "this is one example of the `` self - weakening '' mechanism for the effective tensor interaction .",
    "the 2p-2h diagrams which contribute to @xmath37 in second - order perturbation theory are shown in fig.2 .",
    "we classify them as particle - hole ( or bubble ) ( fig.2a ) , hole - hole ( fig.2b ) , and particle - particle ( fig.2c ) diagrams . in order to show how different parts of the interaction contribute to the isospin splitting @xmath37 ,",
    "we present the perturbation - theory results in table ii for a schematic interaction which was introduced in ref.@xcite for an easy control of the strengths of the spin - orbit and tensor interactions : @xmath50 where @xmath51=central , @xmath52=spin - orbit , @xmath53=tensor .",
    "for @xmath54=1 and @xmath55=1 , the matrix elements of this interaction approximately resemble @xmath0 matrix elements derived from a realistic @xmath17 potential like bonn a @xcite . by setting @xmath54=0 ( 1 ) , we switch the spin - orbit interaction off ( on ) ; by setting @xmath55=0 ( 1 ) , we switch the tensor interaction off ( on ) .    as noted in ref.@xcite , the particle - hole diagram ( fig.2a ) is the most important for getting a large , negative contribution for @xmath37 , but this only occurs when the tensor interaction is turned on . from table",
    "ii , we also note that the particle - particle and hole - hole diagrams are of the same sign and they act against the particle - hole diagrams . for @xmath54=1 and @xmath55=1 , whereas the particle - hole diagrams contribute an amount of -1.728 mev to the splitting @xmath37 , the particle - particle and hole - hole diagrams together give a contribution of + 0.901 mev , leading to a net result of @xmath37=-0.826 mev .",
    "we wish to note , and this point has not been made before , that for the particle - hole diagrams of fig.2a , the most important contribution comes from the case in which the lower vertex involves a central interaction and the upper vertex involves a tensor interaction .",
    "indeed , when the @xmath56 in fig.2a is equal to @xmath57 , the lower vertex can not involve a tensor interaction at all because the matrix element for the lower vertex involves only @xmath58=0 orbits .",
    "thus fig.2a is approximately linear in the strength of the tensor interaction and it tends to act _ against _ the first - order 1p-1h tensor interaction .",
    "another landmark example of the effects of the tensor interaction in a nucleus is the famous @xmath59=14 beta decay : @xmath60 .",
    "the quantum numbers involved in this transition are just right for an allowed gamow - teller ( gt ) transition , but the transition is very strongly suppressed .",
    "the matrix element @xmath61 is essentially zero .",
    "for the two holes in the @xmath42 shell , the wave functions of the initial and final states in the @xmath4 coupling can be written as @xcite @xmath62 it was shown by inglis @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) that it is impossible to get @xmath61=0 with the above wave functions unless there is a tensor interaction present .",
    "since the gt operator @xmath63 can not change the orbital angular momentum , one way ( but not the only way ) of getting @xmath61=0 would be to have @xmath64 .",
    "in general , the gt amplitude is [ @xmath65 @xmath66 the fact that the one - body spin - orbit force for holes is minus that for particles ( whereas the hole - hole two - body interaction is equal to the particle - particle two - body interaction ) leads to a large admixture of @xmath67 in the @xmath8=@xmath68 ground state of @xmath12 .",
    "are higher - shell effects important here ? to answer this question , we give in table iii the results for @xmath61 along with a few other observables , obtained in the @xmath1 and @xmath14 calculations using the nijmii @xcite @xmath0 matrices .",
    "[ as we mentioned in section i , when going from the @xmath1 space to the @xmath14 space , we have modified the pauli operator @xmath31 in the @xmath0 matrix equation ( [ g ] ) to exclude the model - space states from the intermediate spectrum . ] as a contrast we also show in table iii our results for a one - hole system ( @xmath59=15 ) for which there is much less sensitivity to the @xmath14 configuration mixing .",
    "the results in table iii for @xmath61 require some explanation .",
    "the value of @xmath61 for @xmath59=14 that we obtain in the @xmath1 calculation is 3.967 , much larger than zero .",
    "however , in terms of the tensor interaction , this means that we have an _ overshoot_. as discussed in ref.@xcite , the amplitude @xmath69 is large in magnitude when there is no tensor force .",
    "as we turn on the tensor interaction and gradually increase its strength , @xmath69 decreases in magnitude , goes through zero and changes sign .",
    "this happens well before we come to the full tensor strength .",
    "when we further strengthen the tensor interaction towards the full scale , @xmath69 becomes large in magnitude again .",
    "therefore , the large result obtained for @xmath61 in the @xmath1 space again indicates that the tensor interaction is too strong .",
    "when we go from the @xmath1 space to the full @xmath14 space , the value of @xmath61 decreases by about 55% from 3.967 to 1.795 .",
    "this latter value is still far from satisfactory but it is much closer to the experimental answer of nearly zero .",
    "it should be pointed out that , unlike the example of the isospin splitting between @xmath8=@xmath9 states in @xmath6 which we discussed in section ii , in the present case of the @xmath59=14 beta decay , the spin - orbit interaction also plays an important role .",
    "an alternate way of getting @xmath61=0 is to keep the tensor interaction at its full strength but _ increase _ the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "however , in a previous work @xcite , we have seen that the higher - shell effects do not have a significant effect on the spin - orbit interaction as they do on the tensor interaction .",
    "the higher - shell admixtures also have a large effect on the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) moment @xmath70 of the ground state ( @xmath8=@xmath68 , @xmath10=0 ) in @xmath12 , which is @xmath71 in the @xmath1 calculation and @xmath72 in the @xmath14 calculation .",
    "these values are obtained using the bare @xmath73 factors : @xmath74=1 , @xmath75=0 , @xmath76=5.586 , @xmath77=-3.826 .",
    "the experimental result is @xmath78 @xcite .    for the @xmath59=15 system",
    ", we note that the higher - shell admixtures do not have a significant effect on @xmath61",
    ". we can understand this from the theorem which says that there are no first - order corrections to @xmath61 , or to the m1 moment for a system consisting of a closed @xmath4 shell plus or minus one nucleon .",
    "for the two - hole system , on the other hand , the higher - shell effects can , in part , renormalize the particle - particle ( or hole - hole ) interaction between the two quasi - particles .",
    "one more landmark signature of the tensor interaction , although one that is somehow not recognized by many people , is the fact that the electric quadrupole ( e2 ) moment of the ground state in @xmath79 is _",
    "negative_. to show this , we again use the schematic interaction previously described . with the bare values of @xmath80=1 and @xmath81=0 , the quadrupole moment",
    "@xmath31 of the @xmath8=@xmath68 ground state of @xmath79 assumes the following values when we fix the spin - orbit interaction at its full strength ( @xmath54=1 ) and vary the strength ( @xmath55 ) of the tensor interaction : @xmath82 that is to say , when the tensor interaction is switched off , the quadrupole moment is positive",
    ". as we increase the strength of the tensor interaction , @xmath31 decreases from being positive to being negative .",
    "we also calculate the e2 moment @xmath31 of @xmath79 using the nijmii @xmath0 matrices .",
    "the results from the shell - model diagonalization are shown in table iv for three model spaces : @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath83 .",
    "we also give the results for the m1 moment @xmath70 obtained using again the bare @xmath73 factors .    in the @xmath1 space ,",
    "the calculated value of @xmath31 is @xmath84 , which is much more negative than the experimental value of @xmath85 .",
    "again , this could be interpreted as being due to the fact that the effective tensor interaction in this @xmath1 space is too strong . however , as we enlarge the model space , the magnitude of @xmath31 comes down . in the @xmath14-space calculation ,",
    "the value of @xmath31 is @xmath86 and in the @xmath83 space , there is an overshoot : we obtain @xmath87 .    for the m1 moment @xmath70 ,",
    "the experimental value is @xmath88 .",
    "because the ground state of @xmath79 has isospin zero , this is an isoscalar magnetic moment .",
    "the experimental value lies between the value for the @xmath89 limit ( @xmath90 ) and the value for the @xmath4 limit ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "going from the @xmath1 to the @xmath14 space , the calculated value of @xmath70 changes from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "we are still above the experimental value even in the @xmath83 calculation .",
    "the deviation is only @xmath94 or 2.9% .",
    "however , for the _ isoscalar _ moments , one generally has a higher standard than for the isovector moments .",
    "the experimental isoscalar moments lie much closer to the schmidt limit than do the isovector ones and they are less sensitive to configuration mixing .",
    "we feel that @xmath79 deserves further study .",
    "it is the most elementary example of a system with two nucleons embedded in a nuclear medium .",
    "the medium corrections can be calculated to a higher precision than in heavier nuclei .",
    "there are other approaches for dealing with light systems such as cluster calculations for @xmath79 performed by lehman _",
    "@xcite , eskandarian _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and schellingerhout _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . as compared to our shell - model results ,",
    "the above authors seem to get better agreement for the isoscalar magnetic moment of the ground state but the quadrupole moment of this state comes out positive .",
    "one can argue that the cluster approach is more physical . on the other hand ,",
    "the brueckner shell model is not self limiting . with improved technology the calculations",
    "can always be extended in a systematic manner .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that perfect agreement with experiment will be reached since the assumption that we can describe a nucleus solely in terms of neutrons and protons interacting via a two - body interaction may not be correct . but to see this requires very high quality calculations .",
    "another point to be made is that , in contrast to this work where we claim that many anomalies in _ nuclear structure _ relating to the tensor interaction can be explained by simply admixing higher - shell configurations , in the realm of nucleon - nucleus scattering , there have been many works which put forth the idea that the tensor interaction in the nuclear medium must be considerably modified .",
    "these include experimental analyses of hintz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and stephenson _ et al .",
    "they find that the polarization anomalies in proton - nucleus scattering can be removed by adopting the theoretical `` universal scaling '' ideas of brown and rho @xcite that all mesons except the pion are less massive in the nuclear medium .",
    "our next task will be to consider the fact that we do not seem to need medium modifications of the tensor interaction for nuclear structure , but we do need them for nucleon - nucleus scattering .    this work was supported in part by a doe grant de - fg05 - 86er-40299 and an nsf grant phy-9321668 .",
