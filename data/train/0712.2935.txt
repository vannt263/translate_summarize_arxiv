    "the methods of optimal control are very useful for effectively managing various quantum systems @xcite and are particularly important in situations requiring precise quantum operations , as is the case for quantum computation ( qc ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most difficult problems of qc is that unavoidable coupling of the quantum information processor ( qip ) to the environment results in a loss of coherence . in recent years",
    ", significant attention was devoted to various methods of dynamic suppression of environmentally - induced decoherence in open quantum systems , including applications of pre - designed external fields @xcite and optimal control techniques @xcite . in a separate line of research ,",
    "several works @xcite considered the generation of optimally controlled unitary quantum gates in ideal situations where coupling to the environment can be neglected during the gate operation .",
    "the optimal control of quantum gates in the presence of decoherence still remains to be fully explored .",
    "two recent works @xcite discussed specific techniques , involving optimizations over sets of controls operating in pre - designed `` weak - decoherence '' subspaces .",
    "we recently proposed @xcite a different approach in which the full power of optimal control theory is used to generate the target gate transformation with the highest possible fidelity while simultaneously suppressing decoherence induced by coupling to a multiparticle environment .",
    "this method does not rely on any special pre - design of system parameters to weaken decoherence ( e.g. , using tunable inter - qubit couplings as in @xcite or auxiliary qubits as in @xcite ) ; the only control used in our approach is a time - dependent external field .",
    "a similar application of optimal control was also recently considered in @xcite for another model of a decohering environment .",
    "optimization techniques were also applied recently to quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to qec , our approach does not require ancilla qubits and is not limited to the weak decoherence regime .",
    "the optimal control of quantum gates can potentially be used in conjunction with qec to achieve fault tolerance with an improved threshold .    in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we showed that optimal control fields , found by employing a combination of genetic and gradient algorithms , are able to produce high - fidelity quantum gates in the presence of strong decoherence .",
    "optimal solutions revealed interesting control mechanisms that utilize dynamic stark shifts to weaken coupling to the environment and control - induced revivals to restore coherence . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the analysis of optimally controlled quantum gates to situations where ( i ) the environmental particles interact with each other and ( ii ) couplings between the qip and environment and within the environment itself have randomly varied strengths . taking into account these additional environmental effects",
    "makes our model more closely related to realistic quantum information systems ( in particular , spin - based solid - state realizations of qc @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting finding is that the effect of inter - environment interactions on the fidelity of optimally controlled quantum gates is negligible ( potentially allowing one to neglect certain interaction terms in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we also demonstrate that the optimal control generates quantum gates which are inherently robust to random variations in qubit - environment and inter - environment coupling strengths .",
    "we use a model of interacting two - level particles ( e.g. , spin - half particles or two - level atoms ) , which are divided into the qip , composed of one qubit , and an @xmath0-particle environment .",
    "the qubit is directly coupled to a time - dependent external control field , while the environment is not directly controlled and is managed only through its interaction with the qubit .",
    "the evolution of the composite system of the qubit and environment is treated in an exact quantum - mechanical manner , without either approximating the dynamics by a master equation or using a perturbative analysis based on the weak coupling assumption .",
    "the hamiltonian for the controlled system , @xmath1 , has the form @xmath2 @xmath3 here , @xmath4 labels the qubit and @xmath5 label the environmental particles , @xmath6 is the spin operator for the @xmath7th particle ( @xmath8 , in terms of the pauli matrices ) , @xmath9 is the sum over the free hamiltonians @xmath10 for all @xmath11 particles ( @xmath12 is the transition angular frequency for the @xmath7th particle ) , @xmath13 specifies the coupling between the qubit and the time - dependent control field @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the dipole moment ) , and @xmath16 represents the heisenberg exchange interaction between the particles ( @xmath17 is the coupling parameter for the @xmath7th and @xmath18th particles ) .",
    "this model is particularly relevant to spin - based solid - state realizations of quantum gates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in which unwanted interactions exist due to impurities in semiconductor structures or usage of relatively dense lattices of spin - like qubits ( e.g. , electron spins in an array of quantum dots or electrons on liquid helium ) .    in this work ,",
    "we optimize one - qubit gates coupled to @xmath0-particle environments ( @xmath19 ) . for @xmath20",
    ", the system can be modeled as a two - dimensional triangular lattice with the qubit @xmath21 coupled to two environmental particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 for @xmath25 , the system can be modeled as a two - dimensional lattice with the qubit @xmath21 at the center , coupled to four environmental particles @xmath26 : @xmath27 similarly , for @xmath28 , the system can be modeled as a three - dimensional lattice with the qubit at the center , coupled to six environmental particles .",
    "since the evolution of the composite system is numerically exact and our optimization procedure ( described in section  [ optimize ] and @xcite ) is iterative , we limit the number of environmental particles to @xmath29 for computationally tractable simulations .",
    "we will first consider the case of well - specified coupling parameters given by @xmath30 which implies that the qubit interacts with each environmental particle with the coupling parameter @xmath31 and environmental particles interact with each other with the coupling parameter @xmath32 ( compare to @xcite where @xmath33 ) .",
    "then we will consider a more general situation in which every coupling parameter @xmath17 takes a random value from a normal distribution .",
    "let @xmath34 be the unitary time - evolution operator of the composite system and @xmath35 be the unitary target transformation for the quantum gate .",
    "the evolution is governed by the schrdinger equation , @xmath36 , with the initial condition @xmath37 .",
    "the gate fidelity depends on the distance between the actual evolution @xmath38 at the final time @xmath39 and the target transformation @xmath40 . in order to achieve a perfect gate",
    ", it suffices for the time - evolution operator at @xmath41 to be in a tensor - product form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an arbitrary unitary transformation acting on the environment .",
    "therefore , the following objective functional is proposed as the measure of the distance between @xmath44 and @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath45 subject to @xmath43 ( where @xmath46 is a matrix norm on the space @xmath47 of @xmath48 complex matrices and @xmath49 is a normalization factor ) .",
    "using the frobenius norm , defined as @xmath50^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath51 , the distance measure becomes @xcite @xmath52^{1/2 } , \\\\",
    "q_{\\nu \\nu ' } = \\sum_{r , r ' = 1}^{2 } g_{r r'}^ { * } u_{r r ' \\nu \\nu'},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are elements of the matrix representations of @xmath57 , @xmath40 , and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath58 , it is convenient to define the gate fidelity as @xmath59 .",
    "an important property of this distance measure is its independence of the initial state .",
    "in contrast to some other distance measures @xcite , @xmath60 is evaluated directly from the evolution operator @xmath44 , with no need to specify the initial state of the system .",
    "this property of @xmath60 reflects our objective of generating a specified target transformation for whatever initial state , pure or mixed , direct - product or entangled .",
    "a useful measure of decoherence is the von neumann entropy : @xmath61 \\right\\}$ ] , where @xmath62 is the reduced density matrix for the qubit , @xmath63 . for a pure state ,",
    "@xmath64 , while for a maximally mixed state of a @xmath65-level system , @xmath66 .",
    "the initial state used for the entropy calculations is latexmath:[$|\\psi(0 ) \\rangle =    latexmath:[$s_{iz }    @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ frobdist ] ) is independent of the initial state and consequently so are the optimal control fields found for the target gates and the corresponding fidelities .",
    "therefore , the specific choice of the initial state for the entropy calculations places no limitations whatsoever on the generality of the optimal control results .    for the optimal control simulations below , the system parameters are chosen to ensure complex dynamics and strong decoherence : values of @xmath68 are up to 0.02 , which is significant for qc applications , and frequencies @xmath12 are close ( but not equal ) to enhance the interaction .",
    "we define the unit of time and introduce a natural system of units by choosing the qubit frequency @xmath69 for all simulations ( implying that one period of free evolution is @xmath70 ) .",
    "the frequencies of the environmental particles are : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "imposing upper limits on the gate duration @xmath77 and coupling parameter @xmath78 places the dynamics of the uncontrolled system in the regime where decoherence increases monotonically with time ( before the entropy reaches its maximum value of @xmath79 ) .",
    "this dynamical regime approximates some of the effects that the qip would experience from a larger environment , in particular , preventing restoration of coherence to the qubit by uncontrolled revivals .",
    "thus , any increase in coherence may be attributed exclusively to the action of the control field .",
    "combined genetic and gradient algorithms are employed to minimize the distance measure @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ frobdist ] ) ( or , equivalently , to maximize the fidelity @xmath80 ) with respect to the control field @xmath14 .",
    "the target quantum logical transformation is the one - qubit hadamard gate ( an element of a universal set of logical operations for qc @xcite ) .    when a genetic algorithm is used , the gate fidelity @xmath80 is maximized with respect to a parameterized control field @xmath81 . here",
    ", @xmath82 is an envelope function incorporating the field s spectral width and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 are the amplitude , central frequency , and relative phase of the @xmath86th component of the field , respectively .",
    "a combination of these parameters ( `` genes '' ) represents an `` individual '' ( whose `` fitness '' is the gate fidelity ) , and a collection of individuals constitutes a `` population '' ( we use population sizes of @xmath87 ) .",
    "removing the constraints on the control field imposed by the parameterized form above provides the potential for more effective control of the system . in this case the optimal control field is found by minimizing the following functional @xcite : @xmath88 b(t ) \\right\\ } dt   + \\frac{\\alpha}{2 } \\int_0^{t_{\\mathrm{f } } } \\left| c(t ) \\right|^2 dt.\\ ] ] upon minimization of @xmath89 , the first integral term constrains @xmath90 to obey the schrdinger equation ( @xmath91 is an operator lagrange multiplier ) and the second integral term penalizes the field fluence @xmath92 with a weight @xmath93 . applying the calculus of variations to @xmath89 with respect to @xmath91 and @xmath90 yields the schrdinger equation for @xmath90 and the time - reversed schrdinger equation for @xmath91 : @xmath94 , with an appropriate final time condition .",
    "the optimal field is found iteratively , using a gradient algorithm ( see @xcite for optimization details ) .    despite the lack of direct coupling of the control field to the environment",
    ", it can be shown that the composite system described by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is completely controllable ( up to a global phase ) , as defined in @xcite .",
    "however , the restrictions on the gate duration and on the shape of the control field limit the achievable fidelity .",
    "fidelities of one - qubit hadamard gates optimized in the presence of @xmath0-particle environments ( @xmath19 ) are presented in figure  [ fig : fid ] for @xmath33 and various values of the qubit - environment coupling parameter @xmath31 . for a one - particle environment , the control fields optimized for the actual values of @xmath31 result in fidelities at least above 0.9994 . in particular , we obtain @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( a closed system ) and @xmath97 for @xmath98 ( the strongest coupling considered ) . however , it becomes more difficult to counteract decoherence as the number of the environmental particles increases ; as seen in figure  [ fig : fid ] , for larger values of @xmath0 the gate fidelity decreases more rapidly as @xmath31 increases .",
    "we also find that applying a control field optimized for a one - particle environment ( @xmath99 ) to @xmath100 results in a significant fidelity loss ( up to ten percent of the original value ) .",
    "this demonstrates the dependence of the optimal control on the size of the environment .",
    "optimal control field parameters , gate fidelity , and final - time entropy for the hadamard gate coupled to @xmath0-particle environments ( @xmath101 , @xmath98 , and @xmath33 ) are reported in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the fields are intense , with maximum amplitudes ranging from approximately 2.0 ( for @xmath99 ) to 3.9 ( for @xmath20 ) .",
    "the exact time structure of the optimal field is not intuitive and is delicately adjusted to the particular control application .",
    "for example , control fields optimized for @xmath98 are not only more intense than those optimized for @xmath96 , they also have very different structures .",
    "we also find that high - fidelity optimal solutions for @xmath96 are obtained for control pulse durations @xmath102 . in comparison , for @xmath98 , high - fidelity optimal solutions are obtained at longer pulse durations ( cf .",
    "results reported in table  [ tab : results ] , e.g. , @xmath103 for @xmath20 and @xmath104 for @xmath99 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "when the qubit - environment interaction is on , the control field is required to generate the target gate transformation and at the same time counteract decoherence .",
    "as described below , the control accomplishes the latter goal by restoring coherence to the qip and therefore longer pulse durations are needed in the presence of environmental coupling .",
    "as mentioned above , there are also significant differences in the control fields optimized for different numbers of environmental particles .",
    "= 0.52    [ tab : results ]    we also would like to explore how interactions among the environmental particles affect optimally controlled gate operations .",
    "interestingly , we find that for a given @xmath0-particle environment ( @xmath100 and @xmath105 ) , some optimal control solutions obtained for @xmath106 ( e.g. , @xmath107 ) are essentially identical to the solutions found for @xmath33 .",
    "this means that no additional adjustment of the control field is necessary to account for the effect of inter - environment couplings .",
    "moreover , applying these optimal control fields to the systems with @xmath106 yields approximately the same gate fidelity , as seen for @xmath33 ( the actual decreases in the fidelity observed for @xmath108 and @xmath109 are of the order of @xmath110 for @xmath20 and @xmath111 for @xmath25 ) .",
    "= 0.62    control mechanisms can be better understood by examining the decoherence dynamics of the qubit .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit - deco ] shows the time behavior of the von neumann entropy of the qubit for the optimally controlled evolution , with @xmath98 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "the difference between the entropy values for @xmath106 and @xmath114 is extremely small , implying that the same control mechanism works in both cases .",
    "we observe that the optimal control dramatically enhances coherence of the qubit system in comparison to the uncontrolled dynamics .",
    "decoherence is suppressed by the control at all times , but especially at the end of the transformation .",
    "for example , for the hadamard gate with @xmath98 , @xmath115 in the presence of a one - particle environment , which means that at @xmath41 the qubit and environment are almost uncoupled . while the value of @xmath116 increases with the environment size ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) , the optimal control is still able to achieve a significant degree of decoupling at the final time . inspecting eigenvalues of the controlled hamiltonian , we find that the intense control field creates significant dynamic stark shifts of the energy levels .",
    "this effect is mainly responsible for reducing the qubit - environment interaction during the control pulse .",
    "however , achieving extremely low final - time entropies and correspondingly high gate fidelities requires the employment of an induced coherence revival . in the uncontrolled system",
    ", revivals occur at times much longer than @xmath39 , so that the strong coherence revival observed at @xmath41 is induced exclusively by the control field . however , as the complexity of the composite system increases , it becomes more difficult to induce an almost perfect revival ; therefore , the gate fidelity and final - time coherence decrease as @xmath0 increases .",
    "similar results are found for a two - qubit controlled - not gate optimized in the presence of a one - particle environment , in which case we observe @xcite a longer pulse duration ( @xmath117 ) and smaller fidelity ( @xmath118 ) than for one - qubit gates .",
    "in realistic quantum systems , the strength of coupling between particles not always can be accurately measured and is also subject to fluctuations caused by noise or variations due to imperfect manufacturing or preparation .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore the effect of general symmetry - breaking variations in the coupling parameters @xmath119 on operations of optimally controlled quantum gates . given the one - qubit hadamard gate as the target transformation and a fixed number @xmath0 of environmental particles ( @xmath113 ) , we find the optimal control field for a specified set of coupling parameters @xmath17 of eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , with @xmath98 and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "then we apply this control field to an ensemble of systems with normally distributed variations in the coupling parameters @xmath17 and analyze how the uncertainty in the coupling strengths affects the gate fidelity and final - time entropy .",
    "although the dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath116 on the coupling parameters is non - linear ( which implies that the corresponding distributions of @xmath80 and @xmath116 will not be normal ) , our statistical analysis employs only mean values and standard deviations , given by @xmath122 and @xmath123^{1/2}$ ] , respectively , for the gate fidelity @xmath80 , and similarly for the final - time entropy @xmath116 .",
    "the summation is over all elements of the ensemble ( ensemble sizes @xmath124 of the order of @xmath125 are used in the calculations ) .    for each element of the statistical ensemble , the value of each qubit - environment coupling parameter @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) is randomly selected from the normal distribution with a mean @xmath128 and a standard deviation @xmath129 .",
    "analogously , for non - zero inter - environment coupling , , all zero values of @xmath17 are left unchanged . ]",
    "the value of each coupling parameter @xmath17 ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) is also randomly selected from the normal distribution with a mean @xmath132 and a standard deviation @xmath133 .",
    "the statistical analysis of the corresponding fidelity and final - time entropy distributions is reported in table  [ tab : robust ] ( for @xmath134 ) , and frequency histograms of these distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : rfo ] ( for @xmath135 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate a high degree of robustness of the optimally controlled gates to relatively large variations in the qubit - environment and inter - environment coupling strengths . for given values of @xmath0 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , on average",
    "there is just a minuscule decrease in the fidelity and final - time coherence due to the coupling strength variations , and the relative width of the fidelity distribution , @xmath138 , is smaller than @xmath139 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "based on the data in table  [ tab : robust ] , we also observe that the standard deviations @xmath140 and @xmath141 increase with the number of the environmental particles .",
    "table  [ tab : robust ] also helps us to see that inter - environment couplings have very little effect on the gate performance , although their influence slightly increases with @xmath137 .",
    "[ tab : robust ]    = 0.62",
    "this work demonstrates the importance of the optimal control theory for designing quantum gates , especially in the presence of environmentally - induced decoherence .",
    "the model studied here represents a realistic system of interacting qubits with uncertain coupling strengths and is relevant for various physical implementations of qc .",
    "very precise optimal solutions obtained in the presence of unwanted couplings reveal control mechanisms which employ fast and intense time - dependent fields to effectively suppress decoherence via dynamic stark shifting and restore coherence via an induced revival .",
    "in addition , these optimal solutions exhibit a significant degree of inherent robustness to random variations in the coupling strengths .",
    "it is also found that optimally controlled gate operations are practically unaffected by interactions between the environmental particles .",
