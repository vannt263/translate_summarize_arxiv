    "during the last years much effort has been directed towards the study of critical phenomena in various magnetic layered structures , ultrathin films and superlattices @xcite .",
    "the basic theoretical problem is the examination of the magnetic excitation and the phase transitions in these systems . of these , magnetic films are very important both from the theoretical and the experimental standpoints @xcite , and can be studied as models of the magnetic size effect [ 7 ] and as quasi - two - dimensional systems .",
    "the magnetic and phase transition properties of semi - infinite ising systems have been investigated for many years .",
    "the surface magnetism of these systems is very interesting .",
    "it exhibits different types of phase transitions associated with the surface ; if the ratio @xmath5 , ( @xmath1 ) , is greater than a critical value @xmath8 , the system may order on the surface before it orders in the bulk .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the system undergoes two successive transitions , namely the _ surface _ and _ bulk _ phase transitions , whose critical temperatures are called the surface ( @xmath9 ) and the bulk ( @xmath10 ) critical temperatures respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ratio @xmath5 is less than @xmath2 , the whole system becomes ordered at the bulk transition temperature @xmath10 .",
    "magnetic excitations in superlattices were considered in numerous papers ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief review ) .",
    "however , less attention has been paid to critical behavior , and in particular to critical temperatures in superlattices .",
    "ma and tsai @xcite have studied the variation with the modulation wavelength of the curie temperature for a heisenberg magnetic superlattice .",
    "their results agree qualitatively with experiments on cu / ni films @xcite .",
    "superlattice structures composed of alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers have been investigated by hinchey and mills @xcite , using a localized spin model . a sequence of spin - reorientation transitions",
    "are found to be different for superlattices with the antiferromagnetic component consisting of an even or odd number of spin layers .",
    "fishman et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed , within the framework of the ginzburg - landau formalism , the static and dynamical properties of a periodic multilayer system formed of two different ferromagnetic materials .",
    "they have computed the transition temperature and the spin - wave spectrum . on the other hand , the landau formalism of camley and",
    "tilley @xcite has been applied to calculate the critical temperature in the same system @xcite .",
    "compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite appears to be more general because it allows for a wider range of boundary conditions and includes the sign of exchange coupling across the interface .    for more complicated superlattices with arbitrary number of different layers in an elementary unit",
    ", berns @xcite has derived some general dispersion equations for bulk and surface magnetic polaritons .",
    "these equations have been then applied to magnetostatic modes and to retarded wave propagation in the voigt geometry @xcite .    on the other hand , with the developement of modern vacuum science and in particular the epitaxial growth technique , it is possible to study experimentally the magnetic properties of low dimensional systems .",
    "for example , by depositing magnetic atoms on the top of non magnetic substrates , the thickness dependence of the critical temperature of ultrathin films of gd on w(110 ) @xcite and of fe on au(100 ) @xcite , has been measured .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study the phase diagrams of an ising ( spin-@xmath0 ) film in a transverse field within the framework of the effective field theory @xcite .",
    "this technique is believed to give more exact results than those of the standard mean - field approximation . in section 2",
    "we outline the formalism and derive the equations that determine the layer magnetizations , the average magnetizations and the critical temperature of the film as functions of temperature , exchange interactions , transverse fields and film thickness .",
    "the phase diagrams of the film are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief conclusion .",
