    "coherent and squeezed states play an important role in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "they are , moreover , the closest analog of classical states .",
    "however , the coherence of states is a property which is not preserved during time evolution of most quantum systems .",
    "in fact , for a physical quantum system , states undergoing time development often finally approach one of the stationary states of the system . for this reason in quantum mechanics",
    "one is mostly dealing with stationary states ( eigen - vectors of the hamilton operator )",
    ".    in classical hamiltonian mechanics solutions of hamilton equations represent trajectories in phase space , which are important tool in investigation of geometry of hamiltonian systems .",
    "the analog of classical trajectories can be also formulated in quantum mechanics @xcite . in classical case trajectories",
    "represent time development of points in phase space ( classical coherent states ) . however , in quantum case points in phase space loose physical interpretation , and thus trajectories itself are not `` physical '' objects .",
    "nevertheless , quantum trajectories can be used to calculate time dependence of expectation values of observables which have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , solutions of quantum hamilton equations , which can be interpreted as quantum trajectories ( represented in some coordinates ) , describe time development of position and momentum observables . taking expectation values of position and momentum results in a trajectory in a quantum state , which describes average path along which a particle in phase space will move .    in this paper",
    "we would like to investigate in more details the behavior of coherent and squeezed states during time development .",
    "in particular , we will calculate time dependence of expectation values and uncertainties of position and momentum in coherent and squeezed states ( quantum trajectories in coherent and squeezed states ) and examine how coherence and squeezing is affected during time development .",
    "the analysis will be performed for two fairly different quantum systems .",
    "the first system is a linear quantum system , described by a general hamiltonian quadratic in @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables , so in that case quantum trajectories coincide with their classical counterpart .",
    "this is one of the simplest hamiltonians we can consider and has the form of the hamiltonian of harmonic oscillator with some interaction term .",
    "such hamiltonian is very often found in quantum optics where it describes nonlinear interactions of light with a medium . in practice ,",
    "such nonlinear effects are used to create squeezed states of light . for such hamiltonian time evolution of expectation values of position and momenta",
    "coincide with quantum trajectories and , as we show in section  [ sec:3 ] , even in this case coherence is not always preserved in time .",
    "the second system , represents nonlinear quantum system , described by a hamiltonian quartic in @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables .",
    "it is an example of a system with purely quantum time evolution , i.e. the solutions of quantum hamilton equations do not coincide with their classical counterpart .",
    "this is an interesting example of pure quantum flow , revealing the property that evolution of such systems is not well defined for all values of the evolution parameter @xmath2 .",
    "singularities of classical trajectories are not admissible as each classical trajectory represents simultaneously expectation values of positions and momenta of a system in a classical coherent state , i.e. dirac delta distribution .",
    "contrary , pure quantum trajectories themselves are not `` physical '' objects as dirac distributions are not admissible quantum states so , singularities of pure quantum trajectories are acceptable .    unfortunately , even when we consider time evolution of expectation values of position and momentum observables in a quantum coherent state , we get formulas well defined only on certain intervals of @xmath2 .",
    "this is in a strong contrast to the classical case where such time evolution is defined for all @xmath3 .",
    "as we show in section  [ sec:4 ] for this type of systems the states quickly loose coherence and squeezing during time development .    throughout the paper we will be using the phase space formalism of quantum mechanics . in this formalism",
    "many results of this paper can be formulated simpler .",
    "it is also the formalism widely used in quantum optics where it is convenient to consider states of the light as pseudo - probabilistic distribution functions @xcite .",
    "a very short description of phase space quantum mechanics is given in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "a convenient approach to quantum mechanics , which will be useful for investigating time development of expectation values of position and momentum observables , is quantum mechanics on phase space @xcite . in this approach to quantum theory one deforms , with respect to a deformation parameter @xmath4 ( planck s constant ) , a poisson algebra of a classical hamiltonian system to a noncommutative algebra .",
    "this new algebra describes then a quantum hamiltonian system .",
    "one of the benefits of such description of quantum mechanics is that it uses a similar formalism as classical theory .",
    "in what follows we will focus on systems for which phase space is of the form @xmath5 .",
    "a classical poisson algebra is then an algebra @xmath6 of smooth complex - valued functions on @xmath5 with a point - wise multiplication and a standard poisson bracket .",
    "a deformation of this algebra can be introduced in the following way .",
    "the point - wise product of functions can be replaced by the following noncommutative product @xmath7 this @xmath8-product is associative and reduces to the point - wise product in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "it is usually called the moyal product @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the poisson bracket @xmath10 is replaced by the following lie bracket @xmath11\\ ! ] } & = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar } [ f , g ] = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}(f \\star_m g - g \\star_m f ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\{f , g\\ } + o(\\hbar).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it indeed reduces to the poisson bracket @xmath10 in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "the moyal product can be also written in the following integral form @xcite @xmath12 the moyal quantization of a classical hamiltonian system results in a quantum theory equivalent to the standard weyl quantization in the hilbert space of states equal @xmath13 , being the position representation of the moyal quantization .",
    "the algebraic structure of the quantum poisson algebra fully characterizes quantum states .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that quantum states can be represented as pseudo - probabilistic distribution functions , i.e. , as square integrable functions @xmath14 defined on the phase space and satisfying    a.   @xmath15 ( self - conjugation ) , b.   @xmath16 ( normalization ) , c.   @xmath17 for @xmath18 ( positive - definiteness ) ,    where @xmath19 is a normalized liouville measure and @xmath20 is the space of smooth functions on @xmath5 with compact support .",
    "pure states can be described as those functions @xmath21 which are self - conjugated , normalized and idempotent @xmath22 they are in fact the well known wigner functions @xcite .",
    "real - valued functions in the quantum poisson algebra play the role of quantum observables .",
    "an expectation value of a quantum observable @xmath23 in a state @xmath24 is defined in a similar way as in the classical case and is given by the formula @xmath25 let us also recall a definition of the uncertainty ( standard deviation ) of a given observable @xmath23 in a state @xmath24 : @xmath26 where now squares of observables are taken with respect to the moyal product , e.g. @xmath27 .",
    "time evolution of a quantum system is governed by a hamilton function @xmath28 which is , similarly as in classical mechanics , some distinguished observable .",
    "an equation of motion of states ( schrdinger picture ) is the counterpart of the liouville s equation describing time evolution of classical states ( probability distributions ) , and is given by the formula @xcite @xmath29\\!]}= 0.\\ ] ] time evolution of a quantum observable @xmath30 ( heisenberg picture ) is given by @xmath31\\!]}= 0.\\ ] ] in particular for observables of position and momentum @xmath32 , @xmath33 we get quantum hamilton equations @xmath34\\!]}= 0 , \\quad \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}p}{{\\mathrm{d}}t}(t ) - { [ \\![}p(t),h { ] \\!]}= 0 . \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] their solutions @xmath35 represent quantum flow @xmath36 in the phase space @xcite . for every instance of time @xmath2",
    "the map @xmath36 is a quantum canonical transformation ( quantum symplectomorphism ) .",
    "in this section we will characterize the behavior of coherent and squeezed states under time evolution governed by a general hamiltonian quadratic in @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables .",
    "the notion of coherent and squeezed states is often defined in relation to some system , usually a harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus let us consider a harmonic oscillator described by a hamiltonian @xmath37 it is convenient to introduce normalized position and momentum observables @xmath38 in these new variables the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator takes the form @xmath39 a coherent state of the harmonic oscillator is a state for which uncertainties @xmath40 of the normalized position and momentum observables are equal @xmath41 .",
    "a state is called squeezed if one of the uncertainties @xmath42 or @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "then necessarily the other uncertainty has to be bigger than @xmath41 , so that to satisfy the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "coherent states minimize the heisenberg uncertainty relation , i.e. they satisfy @xmath44 squeezed states do not necessarily have to minimize the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "if they do they are called ideal squeezed states .",
    "quantum coherent states have the form of gaussian functions @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a mean normalized position and momentum in the state @xmath24 . recall that @xmath24 is normalized with respect to the normalized liouville measure @xmath19 .",
    "it is also a pure quantum state as one can check that fulfills condition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator preserves the coherence of states , i.e. a coherent state remains coherent during time evolution .",
    "indeed , the quantum hamilton equations read @xmath47 these equations coincide with the classical equations describing time evolution of the observables of position and momentum @xmath48 , @xmath49 since @xmath50\\!]}= \\{h , f\\}$ ] for every @xmath51 . as a result",
    "classical and quantum trajectories coincide @xcite .",
    "in fact such a situation occurs for all systems with hamiltonians being quadratic functions of phase space coordinates .",
    "thus , to solve we can first solve the classical hamilton equations of the harmonic oscillator @xmath52 which solution describing time development of classical pure states is equal @xmath53 where @xmath46 is the initial position and momentum .",
    "by virtue of we can deduce that time evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in classical and quantum case , is expressed by the formulas @xmath56 which indeed fulfill equations .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the expectation values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in a coherent state are equal @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which means that time evolution of expectation values of position and momentum observables in coherent states coincide with quantum trajectories ( in a full analogy with the classical case ) .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties @xmath59 and @xmath60 in a coherent state are equal @xmath41 . thus , coherent states remain coherent during time development .",
    "we will investigate how coherent and squeezed states behave during time evolution given by the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator with the interaction term of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 are some constants .",
    "so , let us consider the following hamiltonian @xmath63 note , that any hamiltonian quadratic in @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables is of the above form for some values of constants @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . again the classical and quantum time evolution equations of observables @xmath54 and @xmath55 coincide , thus the solution of quantum hamilton equations can be found by solving the classical hamilton equations @xmath67 to solve this system of differential equations let us write it in a matrix form @xmath68 the solution of the above equation reads @xmath69 \\begin{pmatrix } q_0",
    "\\\\ p_0 \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] direct computation of the exponent in the above equation allows us to find the solution of the hamilton equations .",
    "hence , after introducing @xmath70 the solution to the hamilton equations in a case @xmath71 reads @xmath72 when @xmath73 we get @xmath74 and when @xmath75 @xmath76    first , let us focus on the case @xmath71 .",
    "we receive the following formulas for time evolution of observables of position and momentum @xmath77 again the above formulas describe time evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in classical as well as in quantum case , which in other words means that classical and quantum trajectories coincide . also for this quantum system time evolution of expectation values of position and momentum observables in coherent states coincide with quantum trajectories , as is the case in classical theory .    in an ideal squeezed state @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a parameter describing a squeezing of the state , we receive the following formulas for the uncertainties @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath80 where we introduced new parameters @xmath81 such that @xmath82 . from this",
    "we can see that for certain values of the evolution parameter @xmath2 the ideal squeezed state evolves into a squeezed state .",
    "it can be calculated that in the case @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 from we can see that the minimization of the heisenberg uncertainty relation occurs only for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are presented plots of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath89 for certain values of parameters @xmath64 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 . from plots ( a ) and ( b )",
    "we can see that there are intervals of @xmath2 on which @xmath92 or @xmath93 but there are also intervals on which the state is not squeezed .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in what follows we will consider several particular cases of the choice of parameters @xmath94 .",
    "first let us take @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ". then @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in this case",
    "we get that @xmath99 and @xmath100 if additionally @xmath83 we receive @xmath101 and @xmath102    now , let us consider the case @xmath73 taking @xmath103 .",
    "then @xmath104 and @xmath105 moreover , @xmath106 and @xmath107 again , if additionally @xmath83 we get @xmath108 and @xmath109 from plot ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we can see that for @xmath110 , @xmath88 the state is squeezed only at the beginning of time evolution until a certain value of @xmath2 is reached .",
    "moreover , as is evident from the heisenberg uncertainty relation is not minimized during the whole time evolution .",
    "further on , let us take @xmath103 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath111 moreover , @xmath112 and @xmath113 in this case , if @xmath114 , the state remains an ideal squeezed state during the whole time evolution .    finally , let us consider the case @xmath75 . in this case",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 it can be seen that during time development the squeezing decreases in time until it is completely destroyed at certain instance of time",
    ". moreover , the heisenberg uncertainty relation is not minimized during the whole time evolution .    note , that after performing the following transformation to new coordinates ( rotation by angle @xmath117 ) @xmath118 the hamiltonian @xmath119 transforms into @xmath120 thus , we can always perform the reduction to the case @xmath95 and @xmath96 provided that we will be working with rotated variables @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , in a case @xmath71 the following one - parameter family of linear canonical transformations of coordinates @xmath122 transforms the hamiltonian into the following hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator with positive frequency @xmath123 and the one - parameter family of transformations @xmath124 leads to the following hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator with negative frequency @xmath125 on the other hand , in a case @xmath73 the following one - parameter family of linear canonical transformations of coordinates @xmath126 transforms the hamiltonian into the following hamiltonian @xmath127 and the one - parameter family of transformations @xmath128 leads to the following hamiltonian @xmath129    summarizing the above considerations we conclude that when @xmath71 we can always reduce the dynamics to the harmonic oscillator , and when @xmath73 we can reduce the dynamics to the case @xmath130 , provided that we will be working with new variables @xmath121 . in the frame of original variables @xmath131 it means that for the considered system there always exist canonically conjugated observables @xmath132 which preserve the minimal uncertainty during time evolution .",
    "let us consider a system described by a hamiltonian @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a characteristic constant of the system . by a coherent state of such system we will call a state for which uncertainties of position and momentum satisfy .",
    "coherent states are of the form of gaussian functions @xmath135 where @xmath46 is a mean position and momentum in the state @xmath24 , and are parametrized by @xmath96 .",
    "the solution of the quantum hamilton equations for the hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath136 it is well defined for @xmath137 .",
    "note , that this solution differs from the classical one @xmath138 which can be obtained from in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "in other words quantum trajectories differ from classical ones .",
    "moreover , time development of position and momentum observables is not well defined for all values of the evolution parameter @xmath2 , contrary to the classical case .    through direct integration",
    "we can calculate the expectation values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 from in a coherent state .",
    "the result after introducing @xmath139 reads @xmath140 note , that @xmath141 and @xmath142 are well defined only on intervals @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "this once again shows that time evolution of the considered system is not defined for all values of the evolution parameter @xmath2 and even time development of quantities measured in experiment like expectation values of position and momentum is only well defined on certain intervals of @xmath2 .",
    "observe also , that time evolution of expectation values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in a coherent state does not coincide with quantum trajectories , as was the case for linear quantum systems .",
    "let us calculate standard deviations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the coherent state @xmath24 . to do this",
    "first we need to calculate expectation values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 . to calculate @xmath147",
    "we can perform wick rotation @xmath148 and use the integral formula for the moyal product .",
    "we find that @xmath149 similarly we calculate @xmath150 @xmath151    the expectation values of @xmath147 and @xmath150 can be calculated similarly as @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we get the following formulas @xmath152 which are well defined for @xmath153 , @xmath144 .",
    "the standard deviations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are equal @xmath154 and are well defined for @xmath155 , @xmath144 .",
    "note , that there are no values of the parameters @xmath156 such that @xmath157 is equal @xmath158 for all @xmath2 .",
    "in other words the coherent state @xmath24 does not remain coherent during time development .",
    "it happens to be coherent only for @xmath159 , @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , the state @xmath24 is not getting squeezed during time evolution in the sense that @xmath59 or @xmath60 is not getting smaller than its initial value . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] are presented plots of @xmath59 and @xmath60 for certain values of parameters @xmath160 .",

    "in the paper we have investigated the behavior of coherent and squeezed states during time development generated by two distinct hamiltonians . as the first hamiltonian we took a hamiltonian quadratic in phase space variables @xmath131 .",
    "this was one of the simplest hamiltonians for which classical and quantum flows coincided , and even in this case the initial squeezed state remained squeezed only on certain intervals of @xmath2 , and only for certain values of @xmath2 the state was coherent .",
    "in fact , only for particular choice of parameters we get the preservation of coherence and squeezing during the whole time evolution .",
    "this result allows to suspect that for more general hamiltonians the coherence and squeezing of states will rarely appear during time development .",
    "furthermore , we showed that after performing appropriate linear canonical transformation of phase space coordinates we could always transform the hamiltonian quadratic in phase space variables to a hamiltonian for which the coherence and squeezing will be preserved during time development , provided that the coherence and squeezing will be defined with respect to the transformed phase space coordinates .",
    "as the second example we considered the simplest hamiltonian with purely quantum time evolution . in this case",
    "the coherence was destroyed during time development and squeezing did not appear . moreover ,",
    "the quantum trajectories and expectation values of observables of position and momentum were well defined only on certain intervals of @xmath2 , which raises problems and questions of interpretation of such kind of time evolution .",
    "this could suggest that the moyal quantization ( weyl quantization in position representation ) applied for the system is not the proper quantization for such system , and that one should use some other quantization in which at least expectation values of observables of position and momentum will be well defined for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "another question is whether in considered quantization there are some quantum states in which these expectation values are properly defined for all @xmath2 ( states does not have such property ) .",
    "we can suspect that for more general quantum systems even more peculiarities can appear , which is an interesting topic for further investigation .",
