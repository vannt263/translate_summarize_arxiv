    "in current galaxy formation models , galaxies form at the center of dark matter halos when gas is able to cool , condense and form stars @xcite . at this stage the galaxy is called a _ central galaxy _ , and its growth is believed to be tightly linked with the growth of the host dark matter halo . indeed , a tight correlation has been well established , both theoretically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observationally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , between the total mass of stars in a central galaxy ( stellar mass , m@xmath1 ) and the dark matter mass of its host halo ( m@xmath6 ) .",
    "at a later stage the central galaxy , together with its host dark halo , may be accreted into a larger halo , and consequently the galaxy becomes a _",
    "satellite galaxy _ and its halo becomes a _",
    "subhalo _ of the new system . as a result",
    "the galaxy will deviate to varying degrees from the stellar mass  halo mass relation of the central galaxies .",
    "in addition , environmental effects such as gas stripping by ram - pressure @xcite and tidal interactions @xcite occurring within the new system may effectively reduce the hot gas halo , and in some cases even the cold gas and stellar components of the satellite galaxy , thus making the correlation with halo mass even more loose .",
    "it is thus important to consider central and satellite galaxies separately when studying the physical link between galaxies and dark halos .    over the past decade",
    ", extensive studies have attempted to determine the halo mass as a function of stellar mass ( or stellar luminosity ) for central galaxies using a variety of observational probes such as galaxy clustering , satellite kinematics , gravitational lensing and group / cluster catalogs .",
    "these studies have obtained a m@xmath6m@xmath1  relation that follows a double power - law form with a small scatter of @xmath13 dex in @xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16  at fixed m@xmath6  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this relation has been widely - adopted to populate dark matter halos with galaxies in current physical / statistical models such as semi - analytic models @xcite , halo occupation distribution models @xcite , and subhalo abundance matching models @xcite .    besides stellar mass , other galaxy properties such as color , star formation rate , morphology and internal structure",

    "in particular , the sdss data have recently revealed that , when both central and satellite galaxies are considered , the galaxy - galaxy correlation function appears to be less dependent on galaxy stellar mass , when compared to the parameters quantifying the prominence of a central bulge in the galaxy , such as central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon may be attributed to the population of satellite galaxies for which the environmental processes such as tidal stripping occurring within their halos have stronger effect on stellar mass than on central stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "when only considering central galaxies and when stellar mass is fixed , halo mass shows little dependence on both the properties indicative of star formation history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", the dark matter halo mass was estimated for samples selected by m@xmath1  and @xmath4 , by modelling the redshift - space distortion in the group - galaxy cross correlation function .",
    "it was clearly shown that , for central galaxies in the local universe , stellar mass is better than stellar velocity dispersion as an indicator of dark matter halo mass .    in the current paper",
    "we extend the work of l13 by considering two more galaxy properties : optical color index ( @xmath2 ) and surface stellar mass density ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "we will estimate both clustering and halo mass for subsamples selected on two - dimensional planes each formed by m@xmath1  and one of the three properties : @xmath2 , @xmath3  and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to analyzing the central galaxies , we will study the clustering properties of both the full galaxy population and the subset of satellite galaxies , and compare the results for the different populations . through these analyses",
    ", we aim to answer the following questions :    * is stellar mass the galaxy property that is most related to halo mass ?",
    "how is stellar mass compared to the recent star formation history ( as indicated by @xmath2 ) , the structural properties ( as quantified by @xmath3 ) and the central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) in terms of linking galaxies with dark halos ?",
    "* is the correlation of halo mass and clustering with galaxy properties always stronger when we consider central galaxies only ?",

    "[ sec : all ] we examine the clustering properties for the full galaxy population and the satellite galaxies .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss on the implications on the link between galaxies and dark matter halos , as well as the relative roles of halo mass and galaxy structure in quenching the star formation in central galaxies .    throughout this paper",

    "for this work we have constructed three samples : i ) a sample of central galaxies based on the sdss group catalog of @xcite , ii ) a reference sample of galaxies selected from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and iii ) a random sample that has the same selection effects as the reference sample .",
    "here we briefly describe these samples and refer the reader to our previous studies for more details : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l12 ) and l13 .",
    "central galaxy sample : : :    @xcite constructed a group catalog by applying a modified version of    the halo - based group - finding algorithm of @xcite to a sample of    @xmath22 galaxies that are in the redshift    range @xmath23 and selected from sample dr72    of the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ) .",
    "the    nyu - vagc is a catalog of local galaxies from the sdss / dr7 , publicly    available at http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc/ , and is described in    detail in @xcite .",
    "following l12 and l13 we restrict ourselves to a    subset of the group catalog , which consists of    @xmath24 group systems with the number of member    galaxies @xmath25 and the stellar mass of the    central galaxy    m@xmath1@xmath26m@xmath8 .",
    "we use the most massive galaxy member as the central galaxy of each    group .",
    "reference galaxy sample : : :    the reference sample is a magnitude - limited galaxy catalog selected    from the nyu - vagc sample dr72 , consisting of about half a million    galaxies with @xmath27 , @xmath28    and @xmath29 . here , @xmath30 is the    @xmath30-band petrosian apparent magnitude , corrected for    galactic extinction ; @xmath31 is the    @xmath30-band petrosian absolute magnitude , corrected for    evolution and @xmath32-corrected to its value at    @xmath33 .",
    "random sample : : :    the random sample is constructed from the reference sample itself    following the method described in @xcite . for each real galaxy in the    reference sample , we generated 10 sky positions at random within the    mask of the real sample , assigning to each of them the redshift of the    real galaxy .",
    "the resulting random sample is expected to be unclustered    but fills the same sky region and has the same position- and    redshift - dependent effects as the real sample .",
    "extensive tests in    @xcite show that random samples constructed in this way are valid for    clustering analyses , provided that the survey area is large enough and    that the effective depth of the survey does not vary . both    requirements are met to good accuracy by our reference sample , which    covers @xmath34 deg@xmath35 , complete down to    @xmath36 and little affected by foreground dust over the    entire survey footprint .",
    "the galaxy properties needed for this work include stellar mass ( m@xmath1 ) , surface stellar mass density ( @xmath3 ) , optical color ( @xmath2 ) , and central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we take the measurements of these properties from both the nyu - vagc and the mpa / jhu sdss database .",
    "the latter is publicly available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/ , and is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we use the optical color index defined by the @xmath37-band and @xmath30-band petrosian magnitudes , which are corrected for galactic extinction , and @xmath32-corrected to their values at @xmath33 using the kcorrect code of @xcite .",
    "a stellar mass accompanies the nyu - vagc release for each galaxy in our group catalog and reference sample .",
    "this was estimated by @xcite based on the spectroscopically - measured redshift of the galaxy and its `` petrosian '' magnitude in the sdss five bands , assuming a universal initial mass function of @xcite form and implicitly correcting for dust attenuation .",
    "we have corrected the petrosian mass to obtain a `` total mass '' using the sdss model magnitudes as described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the masses from @xcite agree pretty well with those obtained from the simple , single color estimator of @xcite , as well as those derived by @xcite from a combination of sdss photometry and spectroscopy . in order to test whether a different stellar mass definition will cause any bias in our analysis , we also use the stellar masses from the mpa / jhu database obtained by @xcite .",
    "the surface stellar mass density of a galaxy is defined by @xmath3@xmath38m@xmath1@xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the radius enclosing half of the total light in @xmath41-band , and m@xmath1  is the `` total '' stellar mass from nyu - vagc as described above .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy provides a stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) in the central 3@xmath42 of each galaxy . for disk - dominated galaxies , however ,",
    "the @xmath4 thus obtained may be dominated by the global rotation rather than the random motion of stars .",
    "therefore we obtain the central stellar velocity dispersion for our galaxies based on both photometry and spectroscopy from sdss , but in different ways for galaxies with and without a prominent bulge .",
    "we determine the significance of bulge based on data from @xcite who have carried out a careful bulge / disk decomposition for @xmath43 million galaxies using the sdss imaging .",
    "a galaxy is classified to have a prominent bulge if the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio @xmath44 , or the effective radius of the bulge @xmath45 .",
    "otherwise , the galaxy is classified to have no / weak bulge component . here",
    "the bulge / disk luminosities and radii are given by the @xmath46 bulge @xmath47 disk fitting model performed to the sdss @xmath30-band image ( see @xcite for detailed description of the model ) .",
    "according to the significance of bulge and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the sdss spectrum , we divide the galaxies into three classes , and obtain @xmath4  in different ways for different classes .    * for those galaxies with both a prominent bulge and a high s / n spectrum ( @xmath30-band s / n@xmath48 )",
    ", we directly use the @xmath4  measurement provided in the mpa / jhu database . following previous studies",
    "we have corrected the @xmath4  of a galaxy to an aperture of its effective radius , adopting the relation found by @xcite : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the radius enclosing half of the total light in @xmath30-band . at @xmath4@xmath52kms@xmath20 where we perform this study ,",
    "about 53% of our galaxies fall into this class .",
    "* for the galaxies with a prominent bulge but a low - quality spectrum with s / n@xmath53 , we assign a @xmath4  to each galaxy according to the correlation between @xmath4  and bulge luminosity @xmath54 , which is given by the galaxies in the above class .",
    "in practice , we bin all the galaxies from the above class into narrow intervals of @xmath54 , and for a given interval we obtain the distribution function of @xmath4  according to which we randomly generate a @xmath4  for the galaxies falling in this interval . in this way both the median relation of @xmath4-@xmath54 in the high - s / n sample and the scatter of the galaxies around the median relation are reproduced in the low - s / n sample . at @xmath4@xmath52kms@xmath20 only a tiny fraction ( 1.4% ) of galaxies fall into this class . our tests here show that dropping this class would not impact our results in this paper . * for the galaxies without a prominent bulge , we follow previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate @xmath4  from converting the circular velocity @xmath55 : @xmath56 , assuming the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model for the total mass distribution of a galaxy .",
    "the circular velocity is given by the tully - fisher relation : @xmath57 with @xmath58 and a dispersion of @xmath59 , which was found by @xcite for the sdss @xmath30-band . at @xmath4@xmath52kms@xmath20 a fraction of 45.6% galaxies fall into this class .",
    "we would like to point out that , although we have obtained the central @xmath4 differently for different morphologies , our results to be presented below are essentially insensitive to the @xmath4 measurements .",
    "we have repeated all the analyses using the @xmath4 measured directly from the sdss spectra , obtaining exactly the same conclusions .",
    "a part of these analyses is presented in appendix of this paper .",
    "detailed description of our methods for measuring galaxy clustering and dark matter halo masses can be found in our previous papers @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly describe these methods . following these papers we estimate errors on all the measurements in the current work using the bootstrap resampling technique @xcite .      in this work we use two - point cross - correlation function ( 2pccf ) to quantify the clustering of our galaxies . for a given sample of galaxies ( sample q ) ,",
    "this is measured with respect to the reference galaxy sample constructed above ( sample g ) , over scales from a few tens of kpc up to a few tens of mpc . on scales larger than a few mpc",
    ", the amplitude of the 2pccf provides a measure of the average mass for the dark matter halos that host the sampled galaxies .",
    "first , the redshift - space 2pccf , @xmath60 , between sample q and g , is estimated by @xmath61 here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the number of galaxies in the random sample ( sample r ) and in sample g ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the pair separations perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the counts of cross pairs between sample q and g , and between sample q and r. the projected 2pccf is then obtained by integrating @xmath60 over @xmath65 : @xmath68 the summation for computing @xmath5 runs from @xmath69mpc to @xmath70mpc , with @xmath71 .",
    "we correct the effect of fiber collisions using the method detailed in @xcite .      for a given sample of central galaxies ,",
    "we begin by estimating the redshift - space 2pccf @xmath60 and the projected 2pccf @xmath72 in the same way as described above .",
    "we then obtain the 2pccf in real space , @xmath73 , by the abel transform of the @xmath5 .",
    "next , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion profile ( vdp ) of satellite galaxies around the centrals is estimated by comparing @xmath60 with @xmath73 , through modeling the redshift - space distortion in @xmath60 .    in order to estimate an average mass for the dark matter halos that host these central galaxies ,",
    "we have calibrated the relationship between the one - dimensional velocity dispersion and the dark matter halo mass , by applying the same method to @xmath74-body cosmological simulations .",
    "finally , based on this relationship , we determine an average halo mass for the sample of central galaxies from their one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "it was demonstrated in l12 that the halo mass thus estimated for central galaxies of given luminosity agrees very well with that obtained by @xcite by stacking the weak lensing signals of sdss galaxies .",
    "we have also compared the halo mass versus stellar mass relation obtained from our method with that in @xcite and @xcite , which were measured from galaxy - galaxy lensing but had smaller statistical errors and better mass modelling compared to @xcite .",
    "detailed description of our methodology , as well as comparisons with previous work and tests on the calibration , can be found in l12 .",
    "we begin with the central galaxies in our group catalog , estimating their redshift - space clustering and dark matter halo mass as function of their physical properties including stellar mass ( m@xmath1 ) , optical color ( @xmath2 ) , surface stellar mass density ( @xmath3 ) and central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) . to this end",
    ", we have selected a number of subsamples on the plane of m@xmath1  versus each of the other parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath3  and @xmath4 .",
    "the selection is shown in figure  [ fig : cen_samples ] , which displays all the central galaxies with small dots in each of the three planes , with the subsamples in each plane enclosed by the black boxes .",
    "the average values of the two parameters for the selection is marked with a cross for each subsample .",
    "this selection scheme gives us at least two intervals in one parameter when the other is limited to a given interval , thus allowing us to study the dependence of clustering and halo mass on one of the two parameters while fixing the other .",
    "figure  [ fig : wrp_mstar_gr ] presents the measurements of @xmath5  for the subsamples of central galaxies selected on the m@xmath1  vs. @xmath2  plane .",
    "we plot the results for different @xmath2  subsamples but fixed m@xmath1  in the left - hand panels , and the results for different m@xmath1  subsamples but fixed @xmath2  in the right - hand panels . at fixed stellar mass and given projected separation @xmath11 , @xmath5  shows very weak or no dependence on @xmath2 , and this result holds for all the masses ( @xmath75@xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath76 ) and separations ( @xmath77kpc@xmath78mpc ) probed here .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath5  at fixed @xmath2  presents strong dependence on stellar mass , in terms of both amplitude and slope .",
    "this effect is true for all the @xmath2  bins except the bluest color bin ( @xmath79@xmath2@xmath80 ) where we have only two subsamples due to the relatively narrow range in stellar mass . at given @xmath2  and on scales between @xmath81kpc and a few mpc , the @xmath5  amplitude increases , while its slope flattens with increasing m@xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the transition between the `` one - halo '' and `` two - halo '' regimes occur at larger radii for higher masses , indicating that high - mass centrals are hosted by dark matter halos with larger virial radii ( thus higher dark matter masses ) when compared to low - mass centrals of the same @xmath2  color .",
    "we present the correlation of halo mass with stellar mass and color in figure  [ fig : mhalo_mstar_gr ] , where the halo mass ( m@xmath6 ) estimated for all the central galaxy subsamples is plotted against both m@xmath1  ( left panel ) and @xmath2  ( right panel ) . for comparison",
    "we have done the same analysis for a set of subsamples selected by m@xmath1  without further dividing the galaxies in each subsample into intervals of @xmath2 , as well as a set of @xmath2  subsamples without further dividing the galaxies in each subsample into m@xmath1  intervals .",
    "this analysis leads to an _ average _ relation between m@xmath6  and m@xmath1  ( left panel ) , and between m@xmath6  and @xmath2  ( right panel ) , which are plotted as triangles connected with a solid line in the figure .",
    "the figure shows that m@xmath6  is correlated with both m@xmath1  and @xmath2 , but the correlation with m@xmath1  is apparently much stronger than the correlation with @xmath2 , in terms of both the scatter and slope of the relations .",
    "the rms scatter of the different @xmath2  subsamples around the average relation between m@xmath6  and m@xmath1  is 26.1% , compared to 138% for the different m@xmath1  subsamples around the m@xmath6(@xmath2 ) relation .",
    "the average relation between m@xmath6  and m@xmath1  can be roughly described by a straight line with a steep slope .",
    "in contrast , the average relation between m@xmath6  and @xmath2  shows a similarly steep ( but more scattering ) relation only for red galaxies with ( @xmath2)@xmath82 . for central galaxies of bluer colors , the average halo mass is nearly constant at @xmath83m@xmath8 , close to the halo mass of the milky way .",
    "we note that , in the stellar mass range of @xmath84@xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath85 , the halo mass appears to even show a non - monotonic dependence on color ( see the green symbols in the right - hand panel ) , with both blue and red galaxies being hosted by dark halos of mass @xmath14m@xmath6@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath86 and the galaxies with intermediate color ( @xmath87@xmath2@xmath88 ) moving in slightly lighter halos ( @xmath14m@xmath6@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath89 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wrp_mstar_mustar ] and  [ fig : mhalo_mstar_mustar ] present the @xmath5  and m@xmath6  estimates for subsamples selected on the plane of m@xmath1  and @xmath3 , in the same format and with the same symbols as above .",
    "the results are quite similar to what are found from the previous two figures , in the sense that @xmath5  and m@xmath6  at fixed @xmath3  show strong dependence on stellar mass , with little residual correlation with @xmath3  when m@xmath1  is fixed .",
    "the halo mass averaged over all stellar masses depends on @xmath3  in a complicated way : m@xmath6  increases with increasing @xmath3 , reaching a maximum of @xmath14m@xmath6@xmath15m@xmath16  @xmath90 at @xmath91@xmath14@xmath3@xmath15m@xmath92@xmath93 , before it declines and becomes constant at @xmath14@xmath3@xmath15m@xmath92@xmath94 . at given @xmath3 , the different m@xmath1  subsamples scatter by an order of 1 - 1.5 magnitude in halo mass , with an overall rms scatter of 155% around the average relation between m@xmath6  and m@xmath1 .",
    "for comparison , the rms scatter is only 19.7% for the @xmath3  subsamples around the m@xmath6@xmath3  relation .",
    "figure  [ fig : wrp_mstar_vdisp ] and  [ fig : mhalo_mstar_vdisp ] present the measurements of @xmath5 and halo mass for the subsamples selected on the m@xmath1@xmath4  plane .",
    "these results were presented in figures 2 and 4 in l13 , and are repeated here for completeness and comparison .",
    "similarly , m@xmath6  varies little with @xmath4  at fixed m@xmath1 , but shows strong and tight correlation with m@xmath1  when @xmath4  is limited to a narrow range .",
    "the rms scatter is 15.2% ( 73.2% ) for the subsamples of @xmath4  ( m@xmath1 ) around the average relation of m@xmath6  with m@xmath1  ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : wrp_mstar_gr ] -[fig : mhalo_mstar_vdisp ] echo the well - established tight correlation between the stellar mass and halo mass for central galaxies in dark matter halos .",
    "more importantly , these figures clearly show that the halo mass  stellar mass correlation holds tight even when @xmath4 , @xmath2  and @xmath3  are limited to a narrow range .",
    "we conclude that , among the physical parameters considered and for central galaxies with @xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16  @xmath95 , stellar mass is the galaxy property that is most closely correlated with dark matter halo mass .",
    "both @xmath4  and @xmath2   are correlated with halo mass , with the former showing a steeper slope and a smaller scatter , but these correlations are largely driven by the correlation between halo mass and stellar mass . the @xmath3   is not correlated with halo mass for the central galaxies as a whole . at fixed stellar mass , the estimated halo mass shows very little correlation with @xmath3 , although we note that the halo mass appears to slightly decline with increasing @xmath3 , particularly in the lowest stellar mass bin ( @xmath84@xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath85 ) .",
    "the lack of correlation between @xmath3  and halo mass at fixed stellar mass implies that the mass  size relation of central galaxies , as well established by the large samples of both high - z and low - z galaxies , depends little on their host halo mass .",
    "we summarize the co - dependence of halo mass on these physical parameters by indicating the estimated halo mass for each sample with a red circle in figure  [ fig : cen_samples ] , where the size of the circle is scaled linearly with @xmath14m@xmath6@xmath15m@xmath16 .",
    "the strong correlation of halo mass with stellar mass , as well as the weak correlation with other parameters , can be visually identified in this figure .",
    "we conclude that , for central galaxies , the correlation of halo mass with stellar mass is still the tightest compared to the correlation with other properties .",
    "in this section we consider the full galaxy sample including both central and satellite galaxies . since our methodology of estimating halo masses is applicable only for central galaxies , in what follows we will focus on measuring @xmath5  for subsamples selected from the full sample , examining its co - dependence on the same set of physical properties analyzed above . following the previous section , we select subsamples of galaxies on two - dimensional planes formed by m@xmath1  and one of the other properties including @xmath2 , @xmath3  and @xmath4 , and for each subsample",
    "we then estimate the project ccf @xmath5  with respect to the reference galaxy sample using the same method .",
    "we start by measuring the @xmath5  for subsamples selected on the m@xmath1@xmath4  plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_wrp_mstar_vdisp ] presents in the left panels the @xmath5  measurements at fixed m@xmath1  but in different @xmath4  intervals , and in the right panels the measurements at fixed @xmath4  but different m@xmath1 .",
    "the ranges of m@xmath1  and @xmath4  used to select the subsamples are indicated in each panel .",
    "an overall impression from the figure is that , in almost all the panels we see systematic shift in @xmath5  with increasing m@xmath1  ( or @xmath4 ) when @xmath4  ( or m@xmath1 ) is fixed . at fixed @xmath4 , the mass dependence of the clustering power",
    "is mainly seen at the highest stellar masses with @xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath96 .",
    "it is not surprising to note that such mass dependence is most pronounced in the highest @xmath4  bin ( the bottom - right panel ) , which is expected given the known correlation between m@xmath1  and @xmath4 . at fixed m@xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath5  increases with increasing @xmath4 , and similarly the effect appears to be stronger at higher @xmath4 .",
    "these trends are more clearly seen in figure  [ fig : all_bias_mstar_vdisp ] where we plot @xmath5  measured at given projected separation @xmath11 as a function of m@xmath1  for subsamples of different @xmath4  ( left panels ) , and as a function of @xmath4  for subsamples of different m@xmath1  ( right panels ) . in the left panels , both the weak mass dependence at low masses and the strong mass dependence at the massive end",
    "are apparently seen .",
    "on average the amplitude of @xmath5  changes little when one goes from the lowest masses probed here ( m@xmath1@xmath97m@xmath8 ) up to m@xmath1@xmath98m@xmath8 , before it increases remarkably at higher masses by at most a factor 2 - 3 depending on scale and @xmath4 .",
    "this result is consistent with the well - established behavior of the relative bias factor ( @xmath99 ) of galaxy clustering measured in sdss and other surveys , which depends weakly on stellar mass for galaxies with m@xmath1  below the characteristic mass of the stellar mass function but quickly increases at higher masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these results hold true when only considering satellite galaxies .",
    "this implies that the different clustering properties at lower masses , as seen in the central galaxy sample and the full sample , are mainly caused by the satellite galaxies which dominate the clustering at the low masses .",
    "in this paper we have studied the clustering of both central and satellite galaxies in a large sample of @xmath016,000 galaxy groups identified by @xcite from the sdss / dr7 , as well as the clustering of the full population including both centrals and satellites . in order to understand the co - dependence of clustering on stellar mass ( m@xmath1 ) and other properties",

    "we have compared these measurements for the different populations , and for subsamples selected by different properties .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows .    1 .   for central galaxies , we find that both the clustering amplitude on scales larger than a few mpc and the dark matter halo mass show strongest dependence on m@xmath1 , and there is no clear dependence on other properties when m@xmath1  is fixed",
    ". this result holds at all the stellar masses considered ( m@xmath1@xmath108m@xmath8 ) .",
    "our finding provides strong support to the commonly - adopted assumption that , for central galaxies , stellar mass is the galaxy property that is best indicative of the host dark halo mass .",
    "the full galaxy population and the subset of satellites show similar clustering properties in all cases , which are similar to those of the central galaxies only at high - mass ( m@xmath1@xmath109m@xmath8 ) .",

    "the clustering properties of the full population and the satellite galaxies differ from those of the central galaxies : the clustering amplitude increases with both @xmath4  and @xmath2  when m@xmath1  is fixed , and depends very weakly on m@xmath1  when @xmath4  or @xmath2  is fixed .",
    "4 .   at fixed m@xmath1 ,",
    "the surface mass density @xmath3  shows weak correlations with clustering amplitude ( and halo mass in case of central galaxies ) .",
    "this is true for both centrals and satellites , and holds at all masses and on all scales , except that at @xmath11 below a few mpc and m@xmath1@xmath10m@xmath8 , the galaxies with higher surface density are more clustered .",
    "the strong mass dependence of galaxy clustering at the high mass end has been well established in previous studies through measuring the auto - correlation function of galaxies in sdss and other surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same effect is revealed in this work by the cross - correlation functions which depend strongly on stellar mass for galaxies more massive than @xmath110m@xmath8 .",
    "it is interesting that the effect holds even when the galaxies are limited to narrow ranges in other properties .",
    "more interestingly , we find that the same effect at high - mass is seen when we divide the galaxies into centrals and satellites .",
    "it is clear that , for high - mass galaxies , stellar mass is the galaxy property that is most strongly correlated with clustering .",
    "this result was missing in the previous study by @xcite who measured the @xmath5   for the full galaxy population as a function of both m@xmath1  and @xmath4 , using the same statistic and similar data as in the current work . in order to understand the reason for the different results in wake et al . and",
    "here , we have performed an additional analysis and present the results in the appendix (  [ sec : comp_wake ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the lack of mass dependence at fixed @xmath4  in wake et al .",
    "can be attributed to the too broad mass binning adopted , which smoothed out the mass dependence at the massive end .    at masses below @xmath110m@xmath8 ,",
    "the clustering shows weak or no dependence on stellar mass , also in agreement with previous studies of the auto - correlation function of galaxies , and there is clear dependence on both @xmath4  and @xmath2  on all scales probed even when m@xmath1  is fixed .",
    "the dependence on @xmath4  at fixed mass found here is apparently consistent with @xcite .",
    "the similarity in the results for @xmath4  and @xmath2  may be reflecting the fact revealed by recent studies that @xmath4  is the best indicator of galaxy color when compared to other properties such as stellar mass , surface mass density and morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the result for @xmath3  is somewhat different from that for @xmath4  and @xmath2 , in the sense that the clustering amplitude shows dependence on @xmath3  only on scales smaller than a few mpc , and this is true only for low - mass galaxies with m@xmath1@xmath10m@xmath8 .",
    "the lack of dependence on @xmath3   on large scales is again consistent with previous studies of auto - correlation functions @xcite , which are found to be independent of @xmath3  on scales above a few mpc .",
    "our result apparently agrees with early studies that examined the correlation of local environment with galaxy properties , finding color to be the galaxy property most predictive of the local environment and structural parameters to be almost independent of local density at fixed stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in l13 we concluded that , when compared to stellar velocity dispersion , the stellar mass is better for indicating the host dark halo mass of central galaxies .",
    "in this work we have extended this work by including @xmath2  and @xmath3 , which are the galaxy parameters sensitive to recent star formation history and internal structure .",
    "we find that stellar mass is still the galaxy property that is most tightly correlated with dark halo mass ( and clustering ) .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the stellar mass is better than other properties such as stellar velocity dispersion , optical color and surface mass density , in terms of linking central galaxies with their host halo .",
    "one may question the reliability of taking the most massive galaxy as the central galaxy of groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a recent study of x - ray observations of nearby clusters of galaxies @xcite has nicely shown that the typical offset is only 20 kpc between the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and x - ray centroid , and that measurements of weak lensing mass centered at bcgs agree well with those centered at x - ray centroids .",
    "this suggested that the bcgs ( and similarly the most massive galaxy ) are indeed very close to the potential center of clusters .    the full sample and the satellite population show similar clustering properties , which are similar to those of central galaxies only at high masses ( m@xmath1@xmath9m@xmath8 ) .",
    "this confirms our previous conjecture that it is necessary to consider central and satellite galaxies separately when studying the link between galaxy and dark matter halos .",
    "the current work shows that the clustering of the two types of galaxies depends on the galaxy properties in different ways .",
    "therefore , the behavior of clustering for a sample including both populations must strongly depends on the central / satellite fraction of the sample .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the stellar mass is always most related with clustering and halo mass at the massive end , where the sample is dominated by central galaxies . at lower masses , in contrast",
    ", the satellite fraction is larger and the result of the full sample is mainly reflecting the behavior of satellite galaxies .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that our results may be helpful for understanding the role of dark matter halos in quenching the star formation in central galaxies , a current topic that has been studied in depth by many authors , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "on one hand , theoretically the so - called `` halo quenching '' process is expected to be at work for central galaxies of massive halos reaching a critical halo mass of @xmath111m@xmath8 , where the infalling gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature and is no longer able to cool efficiently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , recent studies of the correlations between galaxy color and structural parameters based on sdss and high - z surveys have reached a well - established conclusion that the presence of a prominent central object such as a bulge is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for quenching the star formation in central galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result supports the `` morphology quenching '' process proposed by @xcite , in which the buildup of a central massive spheroid can effectively stabilize the gas disk from gravitationally collapsing and forming stars .",
    "recently @xcite suggested a `` two - step '' picture in which both the halo quenching and morphology quenching processes play important roles .",
    "however , the two processes could be essentially the same process if @xmath4  turns out to be most correlated with dark matter halo mass . in that case , halo mass would be the driving parameter for both the growth of the bulge within the galaxy ( as quantified by @xmath4 ) and the gas heating in the host halo .",
    "this possibility can be ruled out according to our analysis which clearly show that the halo mass is more tightly correlated with m@xmath1  than with @xmath4 .",
    "our result suggests that halo quenching and morphology quenching are two distinct processes , driven by different physical processes and parameters .",

    "here we present an additional analysis which attempts to examine the robustness of our results to the different definitions / estimations of stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion , as well as to understand why the previous work by @xcite led to different conclusions .",
    "for the first purpose , we use m@xmath1  and @xmath4  estimates from the mpa / jhu database , the same data as used by @xcite , and we repeat the analysis as done in the main text , selecting subsamples of the full galaxy population on the two - dimensional plane of m@xmath1  and @xmath4  with exactly the same binning scheme .",
    "the @xmath5  measurements are presented in figure  [ fig : all_bias_wake ] . comparing this figure and",
    "figure  [ fig : all_bias_mstar_vdisp ] , our conclusion remains unchanged regarding the co - dependence of clustering on m@xmath1  and @xmath4 , although there are subtle differences in some cases .",
    "again , we find the @xmath5  to depend mainly on m@xmath1  at high masses and on @xmath4  at low masses .    using the same data and the same statistic , @xcite reached a conclusion that is different from ours : there was no dependence of @xmath5  on stellar mass at fixed @xmath4 , but dependence on @xmath4  was clearly seen at fixed m@xmath1 .",
    "however , the results from the two studies may not be comparable , as wake et al .",
    "adopted much wider binning when selecting their subsamples . in order to examine the effect of the different selections , we follow wake et al .",
    "to select 12 subsamples on the m@xmath1  vs. @xmath4  plane with the same binning scheme . the @xmath5  measured at different scales as a function of the median m@xmath1  ( left panels ) or the median @xmath4  ( right panels ) of these subsamples are plotted in figure  [ fig : all_bias_wake ] as large triangles and diamonds .",
    "the results are in good agreement with wake et al . :",
    "the clustering amplitude at given @xmath11 shows strong dependence on @xmath4  at fixed m@xmath1  ( see the comparison between triangles and diamonds in the left panels ) , and does not depend on m@xmath1  at fixed @xmath4  for scales beyond @xmath112 mpc ( see the comparison between triangles and diamonds in the bottom three panels at the right hand ) . comparing these subsamples with the subsamples selected with finner binning , we find that the 6 subsamples in the left panels are dominated by galaxies of relatively low masses ( @xmath14m@xmath1@xmath15m@xmath16@xmath113 ) , a regime where the mass dependence of galaxy clustering is weak as discussed above",
    ". the mass dependence can only be seen at the highest masses , and can be easily hidden if the sample being considered covers a wide range of stellar mass . regarding the 6 subsamples in the right panels , we find that these subsamples are biased to relatively large @xmath4 , but none of them are representative of the galaxies with the highest @xmath4 , only at which the clustering amplitude shows dependence on m@xmath1  at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , our analysis here explains why wake et al",
    ". failed to detect a mass dependence at fixed stellar velocity dispersion , which can be simply attributed to the too broad binning in both m@xmath1  and @xmath4  adopted in their sample selection ."
