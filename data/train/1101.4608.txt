    "despite many efforts devoted , the origin of hydrodynamic turbulence is still poorly understood , because there is a significant mismatch between the predictions of linear theory and the experimental data ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mismatch between theoretical results and observed data is also found in astrophysical contexts , where the accretion flow with keplerian angular momentum profile is a common subject .    the hot ionized keplerian disc flow , which is linearly stable otherwise , in presence of magnetic coupling is shown to exhibit magneto - rotational - instability ( mri ) @xcite based on a local analysis .",
    "then the unstable modes were thought to lead to nonlinearity and then turbulence in the flow .",
    "however , it was also shown that the criterion drawn from the local dispersion relation is inadequate and may be misleading @xcite .",
    "then the question arises that how could a keplerian accretion disc flow having a very low molecular viscosity generate turbulence , which could successively govern diffusive viscosity to support transfer of mass inwards and angular momentum outwards , in absence of any unstable mode of hydrodynamic origin ?    on the other hand , the existence of large transient growth of perturbation in plane couette flow with and without the coriolis force were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the large transient growth plausibly could lead to subcritical transition to turbulence in laboratory experiments and in astrophysical flows which in turn could lead to turbulent viscosity @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the shear flows with and without rotation are physically quite different .",
    "the threedimensional growth factors and then plausible turbulent viscosity in presence of the coriolis force were shown to be significant in keplerian flow only if the elliptical vortices present in the background flow @xcite . the coriolis effect , which absorbs the pressure fluctuation , is the main culprit to kill any growth of energy in the background of linear shear .",
    "moreover , very importantly , the feedback of inherent instability and then sustenance of turbulence based on large transient growth is questionable , in lieu of linear instabilities .",
    "therefore , the problem of hydrodynamic transition to turbulence in rotating shear flow , particularly when angular momentum increases and angular velocity decreases as functions of radial coordinate , e.g. in the astrophysical accretion disc , remains unsolved . while , bech & anderson @xcite found turbulence persisting in numerical simulations of subcritical rotating flows for large enough reynolds numbers , in general the problem of hydrodynamic transition to turbulence in rotating shear flows , particularly the astrophysical ones , has not been paid enough attention in the literature so far .",
    "decades back craik @xcite studied the impact of rotation ( including the keplerian one ) and hence the coriolis effects to the flow with elliptical streamlines . later on , salhi @xcite examined rotation and buoyancy effects on homogeneous shear flows and found similarities between rotation and stratification effects .",
    "in fact , much earlier bradshaw @xcite discussed the formal algebraic analogy between the parameters describing streamline curvature and buoyancy in a turbulent flow .",
    "very recently , the stability problem of unbounded rotating shear flows has been again studied in presence of uniform vertical density stratification @xcite which has important astrophysical applications e.g. in geometrically thin radially stratified accretion discs .",
    "note that indeed johnson and gammie @xcite investigated nonaxisymmetric radially stratified linearized accretion discs in a shearing sheet approximation neglecting vertical structure .",
    "then they studied the time evolution of a plane wave perturbation co - moving with the shear flow . the shearing flow with rotation and stratification",
    "has many other applications , including that in geophysics , as described in detail by salhi & cambon @xcite .",
    "interestingly , same / similar physics is borrowed to understand rotating shear flows in different communities with the use of different terminologies . while engineering community compute  rotational richardson number \" introduced by bradshaw @xcite to understand linear stability of a flow which is proportional to the square of epicyclic frequency used by the astrophysicists and rayleigh number by the fluid dynamicists in general for the same purpose .",
    "while positive richardson number and rayleigh number correspond to linear stability in engineering and fluid physics respectively , @xmath0 ( real value of epicyclic frequency ) is the equivalent condition in astrophysics with angular velocity @xmath1 ( will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections ) .",
    "we show that rotating flows exhibiting pseudo - eigenmodes , in absence of any unstable eigenmode itself , quickly reach a growth rate of the order of the logarithmic norm under a very small perturbation .",
    "this plausibly triggers turbulence .",
    "note that the logarithmic norm , as discussed later , is an upper bound of such growth rates .",
    "this establishes that the intrinsic perturbation in the system is enough to sustain the turbulence which is a manifestation of the transient local instability .",
    "thus , the turbulence of rotating shear flows and the viscosity of hydrodynamic origin in accretion discs is shown to be an inherent property of these systems .    in the next section",
    "we describe hydrodynamic equations in shear flows , pseudo - eigenmodes , logarithmic norm and corresponding transient instability in presence of the coriolis effects .",
    "subsequently , in  3 we discuss solutions .",
    "finally , in  4 we summarize with conclusions .",
    "let us focus on a local analysis considering a small patch of rotating shear flow whose unperturbed velocity profile @xmath2 corresponds to the background shear and angular velocity @xmath1 , as described earlier @xcite , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ shear ] . following earlier work @xcite all the variables",
    "are written in the dimensionless form .",
    "the figure describes our choice of local cartesian coordinates : @xmath3 is along the radial direction , @xmath4 is along the azimuthal or streamwise direction , and @xmath5 is along the vertical direction .",
    "the unperturbed flow has a velocity in the @xmath4-direction and a gradient of velocity i.e. shear along the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the coriolis force arised due to rotation of the patch is described by an angular velocity vector @xmath6 along the @xmath5-direction .    for convenience ,",
    "we write down the corresponding equations for evolution of perturbation in terms of the set of velocity and corresponding vorticity @xmath7 and hence the orr - sommerfeld and squire equations in the presence of coriolis acceleration are given by @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath3-component of velocity and @xmath11 is the corresponding component of vorticity , @xmath12 for a keplerian flow and @xmath13 for a constant angular momentum flow , and @xmath14 is the reynolds number .",
    "note that in presence of linear background shear , what is of present interest , @xmath15 and hence the term proportional to @xmath16 vanishes . for detailed description ,",
    "see mukhopadhyay et al .",
    "we further reduce the set of equations in the form of an eigenvalue equation @xmath17 where @xmath18,\\\\ \\zeta(x , y , z , t)=\\hat{\\zeta}(x , t ) \\exp[i(k_yy+k_zz ) ] , \\label{sol5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath19 , is a differential operator . note that",
    "because of translation invariance of the unperturbed flow in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions , we decompose the perturbations in terms of fourier modes .    the solution of eqn .",
    "( [ sol6 ] ) , describing the evolution of perturbation , can be written in terms of an eigenfunction expansion @xmath20 where the complex eigenvalue of the problem @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath22th mode , eqn .",
    "( [ sol6 ] ) reduces to @xmath23 to obtain the set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , we convert the differential operator @xmath24 into an @xmath25 matrix in a finite - difference representation and then compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix .",
    "the physical parameters involved in the problem ( mainly @xmath14 and the components of perturbation wave - vector @xmath26 described below ) determine the required order @xmath27 of the matrix for adequate accuracy .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that all the eigenmodes are stable , i.e. @xmath28 for all @xmath22 , when @xmath0 .",
    "however , the corresponding pseudo - eigenmodes may be unstable .",
    "following previous work discussing nonrotating shear flows @xcite , let us try to understand it .",
    "if the linearized fluid system is driven by a signal of the form @xmath29 , then eqn .",
    "( [ sol6 ] ) becomes @xmath30 it can be verified that the response will be of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the identity matrix .",
    "the operator @xmath34 transforms the input @xmath35 to the linearized flow at frequency @xmath36 into the corresponding output @xmath37 .",
    "the maximum amplification rate that occurs in the process can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes a norm of the respective quantities , in the present work @xmath40norm @xcite .",
    "now an eigenvalue of @xmath24 is @xmath36 if @xmath41 where @xmath37 is the corresponding eigenvector . on the other hand , using eqns .",
    "( [ amp ] ) and ( [ eigen ] ) @xmath36 can be identified as an eigenvalue of @xmath24 if the perturbation with frequency @xmath36 brings an unbounded amplification so that @xmath42    generalizing the above definition of an eigenvalue , we can define @xmath36 as an @xmath43-pseudo - eigenvalue @xcite of @xmath24 for any @xmath44 , if @xmath45 when @xmath37 is the corresponding @xmath43-pseudo - eigenvector / mode such that @xmath46 naturally as @xmath47 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 tend to be the pure eigenmode and eigenvalue respectively .",
    "the set of @xmath43-pseudo - eigenvalues of an operator is called the @xmath43-pseudo - eigenspectrum .",
    "therefore , we can classify the amplification in three regimes .",
    "first , if @xmath14 is equal or greater than a certain critical value @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , and @xmath24 has at least one _ eigenvalue _ in the upper half - plane of the argand diagram , then @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; the flow in this regime is linearly unstable ( i.e. the system has at least one exponential growing mode ) .",
    "second , if @xmath14 is smaller than a certain value , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , and all the _ eigenvalues _ lie in the lower half - plane of the argand diagram , then @xmath54 and @xmath55 ; this implies no amplification ( i.e. there is no exponential growing mode ) . finally ,",
    "if @xmath56 and @xmath24 has at least one pseudo - eigenvalue in the upper half - plane ( although all the eigenvalues still lie in the lower half - plane ) , then @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; this is the regime of linearly stable flow with the existence of transient growth ( i.e. the system has at least one growing pseudo - eigenmode ) .      now",
    "a very important related quantity is the logarithmic norm which is the upper bound of the possible transient growth rate .",
    "the logarithmic norm , @xmath59 , of a square matrix operator @xmath60 using a matrix @xmath61-norm is defined @xcite as @xmath62 for a natural number @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the time interval , @xmath65 is the set of real numbers . for @xmath66",
    ", it is readily shown that @xmath67\\right ) , \\label{mu2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 denotes an eigenvalue of the symmetric operand matrix and @xmath69 indicates real part .",
    "the growth of the solution @xmath70 of eqn .",
    "( [ sol7 ] ) over a non - zero time interval @xmath64 can be upper bounded @xcite as follows : @xmath71 and the limiting maximum growth rate then can be written as @xmath72 from which one can see that the logarithmic norm of @xmath73 determines the upper bound of the transient growth of the system in eqn .",
    "( [ sol7 ] ) .",
    "hence , for a suitably small perturbation if we obtain a pseudo - eigenvalue which is close to the logarithmic norm and is in the upper half plane of the argand diagram , then the system will exhibit sustainable transient instability .",
    "the non - negative real parts in the pseudo - eigenspectrum of @xmath73 , i.e. the values in the upper half plane of the argand diagram for the pseudo - eigenspectrum of @xmath74 , drive the transient growth .",
    "the pseudo - eigenvalue of @xmath75 can be defined , equivalently to eqn .",
    "( [ epeigen ] ) , as @xcite @xmath76 using the triangular inequality property of the logarithmic norm , we can write @xmath77 \\le \\mu_2(-i { \\mathcal l } + e ) \\le \\mu_2(-i { \\mathcal l } )   + \\epsilon . \\label{lognormeps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above inequality leads to the computation of a minimum @xmath43 ( namely @xmath78 ) for which the equality holds .",
    "if @xmath78 is small ( compared to the matrix @xmath79-norm of the operator , i.e. , @xmath80 ) such that @xmath81 > 0 $ ] , i.e. , there are pseudo - eigenvalues in the upper half plane of the argand diagram , then we can conclude that the rotational shear flow system with the coriolis effect exhibits transient growth sustained by small intrinsic perturbations .",
    "we solve the eigenvalue equation ( [ sol66 ] ) with no - slip boundary conditions @xmath82 in table 1 we enlist the optimum sets of parameters governing the perturbation that induce maximum growth for various values of @xmath83 .",
    "we compute the maximum transient growth @xmath84 induced by the perturbation and the pseudo - eigenvalues determining the lower bound of the transient growth of energy : @xmath85 , where @xmath86 indicates imaginary part .",
    "interestingly , while for @xmath13 the optimum perturbation giving rise to the maximum growth is purely vertical , for @xmath87 it is purely twodimensional .",
    "for @xmath88 it is threedimensional with @xmath89 and @xmath90 both nonzero .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the optimum pseudo - eigenspectra for various values of @xmath83 . naturally for @xmath13 the spectrum is marginally unstable and the pseudo - eigenspectra for all values of @xmath43 extend to the upper half plane in the argand diagram .",
    "however , as @xmath83 decreases , particularly from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , the pseudo - eigenvalues for particular values of @xmath43 , e.g. @xmath93 and @xmath94 , decrease , which in turn decrease the rate of maximum growth as shown in table 1 .    as the maximum growth for @xmath13 is due to the pure vertical perturbation",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the pseudo - eigenspectra due to the pure vertical perturbation , giving rise to the maximum possible growth ( maximal pure vertical perturbation ) , for @xmath0 as well .",
    "corresponding parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "interestingly , the spectra and thus growth for a particular @xmath83 appear quite different between that for the optimum and vertical perturbation ( particularly for smaller values of @xmath83 ) .",
    "this is due to the coriolis effect generating epicyclic oscillations appeared in the later case , which is responsible for hindering growing pseudo - eigenmodes .",
    "note that the energy growth due to pure vertical perturbation is bounded by the dynamics of the system and is independent of @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare pseudo - eigenspectra of the flow with @xmath87 and @xmath95 for two different values of @xmath14 and find them very similar , reflecting their independence of @xmath14 under pure vertical perturbation .",
    "table 3 shows the minimum perturbation ( @xmath78 ) for which the logarithmic norm rate of growth is approached .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath96 . also , at @xmath13 the flow is most susceptible to transient growth since the required perturbation is the least .",
    "a decrease in @xmath83 reduces the susceptibility to transient growth as the magnitude of the required perturbation increases .",
    "however , @xmath78 is still quite small even for @xmath87 , assuring local instability and sustained turbulence .",
    "while the existence of unstable pseudo - eigenmodes favors instability and then plausible turbulence under finite amplitude perturbation , the question remained whether the local instability is sustained or not .",
    "the present analysis argues that the rotating shear flows with the coriolis force not only exhibit unstable pseudo - eigenmodes under suitable small perturbations , but also the growth rate in the pseudo - eigenmodes approaches a strictly positive logarithmic norm and thus assures feedback of instability as an intrinsic property of the flows .",
    "therefore , a very small amplitude of perturbation is able to trigger instability and then plausible turbulence in the system . in lieu of linear instabilities ( of hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic origin )",
    "unstable pseudo - eigenmodes repopulating the growing disturbance assure _ sustained _ turbulence .",
    "this argues , for the first time , in favor of _ sustained _ hydrodynamic instability and then turbulence in a rotating couette like flow , when angular momentum increases and angular velocity decreases with radius .",
    "this is practically the flow of many astrophysical systems , e.g. accretion disc around compact objects , some active galactic nuclei , star - forming systems .",
    "this is possible to conceive because of the non - self adjoint nature of underlying operator , giving rise to the non - normal eigenmodes and hence unstable pseudo - eigenspectrum and positive logarithmic norms .",
    "note that molecular viscosity is too small to explain the observed accretion efficiencies in the systems mentioned above .",
    "therefore , any viscosity is expected to arise due to turbulence in the flow .",
    "hence , in absence of any linear instability in the keplerian accretion flows , existence of small perturbations triggering local transient growth rates of the order of logarithmic norm , which is strictly positive for the associated spatial operator matrix , resolve the question of instability and corresponding feedback process which replenish the growth to an ultimate turbulence state .",
    "this is a new alternate picture of turbulence arousal in astrophysical flows explaining the transport of mass inward removing angular momentum outward , particularly when transport due to the nonlinearly developed mri is expected to be very small @xcite in experimental setups with small magnetic prandtl number .",
