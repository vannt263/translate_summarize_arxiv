    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) containing weakly magnetized neutron stars can be divided into two classes based on their correlated x - ray spectral and timing behavior : the so - called z and atoll sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . z sources are thus named as they trace out roughly z - shaped tracks in x - ray color - color or hardness - intensity diagrams on a time scale of hours to days .",
    "they are among the most luminous lmxbs , with x - ray luminosities close to the eddington limit , @xmath3 .",
    "atoll sources sometimes produce patterns which are reminiscent of a ` c ' , have luminosities in the range 0.010.5 @xmath3 , and often show x - ray bursts .",
    "their motion in the diagram is slower ( on time scales of days to weeks ) in the upper left parts of the diagram , the so - called islands , while it is faster ( on time scales of hours to a day ) in the bottom and right - hand parts of the track , called lower and upper banana , respectively ( see e.g.  prins & van der klis 1997 , mndez et al .",
    "1997 , di salvo et al .   2001",
    "; see also muno et al .",
    "2002 , gierlinski & done 2002 , van straaten et al .  2002a , barret & olive 2002 , for recent work on the behavior of atoll sources in the color - color diagram ) .",
    "in a given source , the islands usually correspond to lower flux levels than the banana branch .",
    "there is evidence that most timing and spectral characteristics of these sources depend in a simple way on the position along the z or atoll track ( see van der klis 1995 , 2000 for reviews ) .",
    "in fact , the characteristic strengths and frequencies of the timing variability of a source usually vary in a monotonic way as the source moves along the track , although some sources can show more complicated behaviors ( see , e.g. , the case of gx 17 + 2 , homan et al .",
    "this general and regular behavior suggests that a single parameter , usually proposed to be the mass accretion rate , @xmath4 , governs most of this phenomenology ; changes in @xmath4 probably cause changes in the accretion flow , which simultaneously affect the x - ray spectrum and the rapid x - ray variability . in this scenario",
    "the mass accretion rate is thought to increase from the horizontal branch to the flaring branch in z sources , and from the islands to the banana branch in atoll sources ( see e.g. hasinger et al .  1990 , van der klis 1995 ) .    at low inferred mass accretion rate the power spectra of these sources",
    "are usually dominated by band limited noise ( bln ) components .",
    "this noise component , usually called in the literature high - frequency noise in atoll sources and low - frequency noise in z sources , has a flat shape up to a break frequency , @xmath5 , above which it decreases with increasing frequency ; it has been often described by a broken power law or a power law with a cutoff at high frequencies . however , since recently , a lorentzian model for this component is preferred ( olive et al .",
    "1998 ; belloni et al .",
    "2002 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2002b ) , since this facilitates the comparison with the power spectra of black hole candidate binaries , which are well fitted by lorentzians ( see e.g.  miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ; nowak 2000 ) , and because a lorentzian gives sometimes a better description of the noise shape than a broken power law ( van straaten et al .",
    "furthermore , lorentzians are more suitable than power laws to describe components that show large changes in quality factor , which have been observed in some sources ( see e.g.  di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2002b ) . at high inferred mass accretion rate another type of noise component , with a power - law shape ,",
    "@xmath6 with index @xmath7 , called very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) , dominates at frequencies less than @xmath8 hz .",
    "the properties of both these noise components strongly correlate with the position of the source in the color - color diagram . at the lowest inferred @xmath4 ,",
    "the bln is quite strong ( with a fractional rms amplitude of 1020% ) . when the mass accretion rate increases , as inferred from the source position in the color - color diagram , the rms amplitude of the bln decreases to @xmath9",
    ". simultaneously , the break frequency increases from a few hz to tens of hz ( this occurs at least in the part of the color - color diagram in which the khz qpos are detected ; see e.g.  wijnands & van der klis 1999 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1999a , di salvo et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) . at the highest inferred @xmath4 levels , when the khz qpos are no longer detected ,",
    "a bln component is sometimes still detected , usually with a characteristic frequency of @xmath10 hz ( e.g.  hasinger & van der klis 1989 , di salvo et al .",
    "2001 , van straaten et al .",
    "2002b , see also sect .",
    "the vlfn , on the other hand , usually has its lowest fractional amplitude at low inferred accretion rate ( @xmath11 ) and its amplitude gradually increases with inferred accretion rate , sometimes up to @xmath12 ( see van der klis 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the bln in atoll and z sources is usually accompanied by quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at frequencies between 10 and 40  hz , slightly higher than the break frequency of the bln .",
    "these are the so - called low - frequency qpo ( lfqpo ) in atoll sources , and horizontal branch oscillations ( hbo ) in z sources .",
    "similar to the break frequency of the bln , the frequency of these qpos increases when the source moves in the color - color diagram in the sense of increasing mass accretion rate ( e.g.  van der klis et al .  1985 ;",
    "stella & vietri 1998 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ; psaltis et al .  1999a , and references therein ) .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpos decreases more or less gradually when the source moves from the horizontal branch to the normal branch in z sources , and from the islands to the banana in atoll sources .",
    "observations with the large area instrument on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) led to the discovery in 1996 of qpos at kilohertz frequencies ( khz qpos ) in the persistent emission of z and atoll sources . to date , khz qpos have been observed in the power spectra of more than 20 lmxbs , with frequencies ranging from a few hundred hz up to @xmath13 hz ( the maximum khz qpo frequency of 1330 hz has been measured in 4u 0614 + 09 , van straaten et al .  2000 ; see van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "usually two khz qpo peaks ( `` twin peaks '' ) are simultaneously observed , the difference between their centroid frequencies being in the range 250350  hz .",
    "the khz qpo frequencies increase when the source moves in the color - color diagram in the sense of increasing inferred @xmath4 .",
    "however , while there is a general correlation between khz qpo frequencies and position in the color - color diagram , the correlation between khz qpo frequencies and the source x - ray count rate or x - ray flux in the 250  kev energy range is complex ; a correlation is observed on short time scales ( hours to days ) , but not on longer time scales .",
    "therefore , when observed at different epochs , in a frequency vs.  flux diagram a source produces different tracks that are approximately parallel ( e.g.  mndez et al .",
    "a possible explanation of this behavior is that most timing and spectral parameters are determined by the dynamical properties of the accretion disk , while the x - ray flux is determined by the total accretion rate , which may be different from the instantaneous accretion rate through the disk if , for instance , matter can flow radially close to the neutron star ( see e.g.  van der klis 2001 ; note , however , that the radial flow can not be completely independent of the disk flow , see mndez et al .",
    "this might also explain the lack of a simple correlation between the x - ray flux ( which is usually considered to be a good measure of @xmath4 ) and other timing properties and/or position in the color - color diagram on time scales of days to weeks ( see e.g. mndez & van der klis 1999 , ford et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "the whole scenario is not clear yet , and in this paper we will continue to use the widely adopted terminology of `` inferred mass accretion rate '' to indicate the position of the source in the color - color diagram , keeping in mind that , while this terminology might be correct for the short term ( hours to a day ) , in the longer term there might not be an exact correspondence between instantaneous accretion rate and position in the color - color diagram .    quasi - coherent oscillations during type - i x - ray bursts have now been detected in several sources , and are all in the rather narrow frequency range between 300 and 600  hz ( see van der klis 2000 ; strohmayer 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "usually , the frequency of burst oscillations increases by 12hz during the tail of the burst , and saturates to an `` asymptotic frequency '' which in a given source is consistent with being constant .",
    "this asymptotic frequency is interpreted as the neutron star spin frequency , due to a hot spot ( or spots ) in an atmospheric layer of the rotating neutron star . for those sources in which both burst oscillations and khz qpos",
    "have been observed , it has been found that the frequency separation between the two simultaneous khz qpos is similar to the frequency of the burst oscillations , or half that value .",
    "this suggests a beat frequency mechanism as the origin of the khz qpos ( strohmayer et al .  1996 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , where the higher - frequency khz qpo ( upper peak ) is interpreted as the keplerian frequency at the innermost edge of the accretion disk , and the lower - frequency khz qpo ( lower peak ) is the beat between this keplerian frequency and the spin frequency , @xmath14 , of the neutron star .",
    "however , the peak separation is sometimes significantly smaller than the frequency of the burst oscillations ( e.g.  mndez et al .",
    "1998a ) , and decreases as the frequency of the khz qpos increases ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; mndez et al .",
    "1998a ; mndez & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "this led to modifications to the simple beat frequency model ( lamb & miller 2001 ) , or to different models for the khz qpos ( see e.g.  stella & vietri 1999 ; osherovich & titarchuk 1999 ; kluniak & abramowicz 2002 ) .",
    "4u 1636536 is one of the most interesting lmxbs of the atoll class .",
    "it contains a neutron star accreting matter from a companion star of mass @xmath15 @xmath16 with an orbital period of 3.8 hr ( see , e.g. , van paradijs et al .",
    "type - i x - ray bursts were observed several times from this source , sometimes with unusual shapes ( e.g.  turner & breedon 1984 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1986 ) , or unusually long durations ( e.g.  wijnands 2001 ) .",
    "duration and temperature of the x - ray bursts in this source strongly correlate with the x - ray spectral and fast variability characteristics of the persistent emission , implying a correlation of all these characteristics with the mass accretion rate or disk dynamical properties ( van der klis et al .",
    "recently highly coherent oscillations at a frequency of @xmath17 hz have been observed for @xmath18 s during a `` superburst '' from this source ( strohmayer & markwardt 2002 ) .",
    "no evidences of higher harmonics or the subharmonic at 290 hz have been found .",
    "the high coherence of this signal provides further support to a connection between burst oscillations and spin of the neutron star . however , the frequency measured during the superburst is significantly higher than any of the asymptotic burst oscillation frequencies measured for 636 ( @xmath19 hz , see e.g.strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 ; giles et al .  2002 ) .",
    "two simultaneous khz qpos have been observed in this source , with rms amplitudes increasing with photon energy ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ; wijnands et al .",
    "the frequency of the lower khz qpo increases , and its amplitude decreases , with inferred @xmath4 , and at high @xmath4 the frequency difference between the two qpos is in the range @xmath20 hz , significantly lower than half the frequency of the oscillations detected during type - i bursts ( mndez et al .",
    "recently it has been shown that , at low inferred mass accretion rate , the khz qpo peak separation in 636 is @xmath21 hz , which exceeds the neutron star spin frequency ( or half its value ) as inferred from burst oscillations ( jonker et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "third , and possibly fourth , weaker khz qpos have been discovered simultaneously with the previously known khz qpo pair ( jonker et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the new khz qpos are at frequencies of @xmath22 hz above and below , respectively , the frequency of the lower khz qpo , suggesting that these are sidebands to the lower khz qpo .",
    "636 , together with 4u  160852 and aql  x1 , also shows qpos at mhz frequencies ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "this feature seems to occur only in a rather narrow range of mass accretion rates , corresponding to x - ray luminosities of @xmath23 ergs / s , and they disappear after x - ray bursts .",
    "contrary to the general behavior of qpos , the rms amplitude of the mhz qpos strongly decreases with energy .",
    "a systematic study of the correlated rapid x - ray variability and x - ray spectral properties of 636 , as derived from color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams , was performed on exosat data by prins & van der klis ( 1997 ) .",
    "they found that over a period of two years the source traced out similar patterns in the color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams .",
    "however , in observations taken months apart the position of the patterns was slightly ( a few percent ) shifted in the color - color plane , corresponding to much larger differences in the intensity .",
    "they also found that the power spectral components were clearly correlated to the position of the source in this pattern corrected for the shifts due to the secular motion ; in particular , with increasing inferred mass accretion rate the fractional rms amplitude of the power - law shaped vlfn increased , while the bln component amplitude , as well as its cutoff frequency , decreased .",
    "in this paper we present the broad band ( 0.01 - 2048 hz ) power spectra of 636 extracted at different positions of the source in the color - color diagram , as well as a study of the secular variations of the position of the atoll pattern in both the hardness - intensity and the color - color diagram .",
    "we analyzed all the observations from the public rxte archive performed between april 1996 and february 1999 .",
    "the log of these observations is presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we used data from the proportional counter array ( pca ; zhang et al .",
    "1993 ) on board rxte , which consists of five co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcu ) , sensitive in the energy range @xmath24 kev , with a total collecting area of 6250 @xmath25 and a field of view , delimited by collimators , of @xmath26 fwhm .",
    "we selected intervals for which the elevation angle of the source above the earth limb was greater than 10 degrees .",
    "several bursts occurred during these observations ; we excluded those intervals ( @xmath27 s around each burst ) from our analysis .",
    "we used the standard 2 mode data ( 16 s time resolution ) to produce light curves and the color - color diagram , and event data , with time resolution of 1/8192 s ( @xmath28s ) , to produce fourier power spectra . for the power spectra we also discarded those data ( @xmath29% of the total ) where one or more of the five pcus were switched off .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .rxte observations of 636 used in this paper .",
    "the count rate has been normalized to 3 pca units and is corrected for the background . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we produced background subtracted lightcurves binned at 16  s using pca standard 2 mode data from pcus 0 , 1 , and 2 , and the pca background model 2.1b .",
    "the lightcurves were divided into four energy bands , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 kev ( according to the correspondence between fixed energy channels and energy valid for the pca gain epoch 3 ) .",
    "we defined the soft color as the ratio of the count rate in the bands @xmath31 kev and @xmath30 kev , the hard color as the ratio of count rate in the bands @xmath33 kev and @xmath32 kev , and the intensity as the count rate in the energy band 216 kev , in order to produce color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams . the observations considered here span almost three years , from 1996 april 23 to 1999 february 27 .",
    "all of them fall in the pca gain epoch 3 ( from 1996 april 15 to 1999 march 22 ) .",
    "however , to take into account the ( smaller ) continuous gain changes occurring within one epoch , we used the same procedure already applied in previous works ( see e.g.  kuulkers et al .",
    "1994 , van straaten et al .",
    "2000 , di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ) : we selected rxte observations of crab obtained close to the dates of our observations , and calculated the corresponding x - ray colors of crab . because the spectrum of crab is supposed to be constant , any changes observed in the colors of crab are most probably caused by changes in the instrumental response . between april 1996 and february 1997 there are no significant shifts in the crab colors . between february 1997 and february 1998 the soft and hard colors of crab increased by @xmath34% and @xmath35% , respectively",
    ". from february 1998 to february 1999 the crab soft color slightly increased by up to @xmath36 , while the hard color remained almost constant ( changes were less than @xmath37 )",
    ". to take into account these variations we divided the colors calculated for 636 by the corresponding colors of crab",
    "; these latter were on average : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the changes in the pca gain , although small , might also affect the source count rate .",
    "on average , the crab count rate decreased from april 1996 to february 1999 by up to @xmath40 .",
    "so we applied a similar correction to the source intensity , which was normalized to the crab count rate ( the average 216 kev crab count rate was @xmath41 c / s / pcu ) .",
    "the color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams , normalized to the crab and rebinned so that each point corresponds to 64 s of data , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . we have checked the validity of the correction based on crab by using spectral fits of 636 observations and the corresponding response matrices ( see e.g.  barret & olive 2002 ) .",
    "we find that the correction factors obtained in this way are very similar to those calculated using crab .",
    "they are @xmath42 larger in soft color and @xmath43 larger in hard color than the crab - based correction factors , which are comparable with the 1% uncertainty in the pca response matrix and with the statistical errors on the colors .",
    "0.5 cm    during these observations the source was in the so - called banana state , at high inferred mass accretion rate . as it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , significant shifts of the position of the atoll track are observed in the hardness - intensity diagram . the most evident shift ( indicated by a big arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) is between the dataset of observation p10088 ( between april 1996 and february 1997 , red points ) and the dataset of observation p40028 ( between january 1999 and february 1999 , light - blue points ) on the right - hand side of the hardness - intensity diagram , corresponding to the upper banana .",
    "probably a shift is also present within the dataset of observation p10088 ( in particular between data obtained before 1996 april 30 , which correspond to a lower flux level , and data obtained after 1996 november , which correspond to a higher flux level ) and between this latter dataset and the dataset of observations p10072 ( in 1996 april and may , black points ) and p30053 ( in 1998 february and august , gray points ) on the left - hand side of the diagram ( lower banana , indicated by a small arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . in both parts of the hardness - intensity diagram",
    "the shift in intensity is @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , it seems that two parallel atoll tracks are present , one shifted @xmath1 towards lower intensity with respect to the other one . in the color - color diagram , these two atoll tracks overlap each other .",
    "however , similar shifts as in the hardness - intensity diagram , although much less evident , are present .",
    "this is especially clear in the upper banana ( on the right side of the atoll track ) , where it is possible to see that the points of observation p10088 ( red points ) have soft color systematically higher than the points of observation p40028 ( light - blue points ) .    to parametrize the position of the source along the atoll track we used the @xmath44 parametrization method that is usually used for z sources ( introduced by hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; hertz et al .",
    "1992 , and then refined in successive works , see e.g.  homan et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "we projected the points in the color - color diagram onto a spline , @xmath2 , in which two vertices are placed as reference in the atoll track .",
    "we set @xmath45 at the color - color locus ( 0.99 , 0.71 ) and @xmath46 at ( 1.18 , 0.68 ) , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "a difficulty of this method in the case of atoll sources when compared to z sources is the lack of sharp corners in the atoll track , which makes the choice of the vertex points rather arbitrary .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to study the timing properties of 636 as a function of the source spectral state , as derived from the position in the color - color diagram .",
    "we begin with the study of the khz qpo frequencies , dividing the pca lightcurve into 64-s long segments for which we calculated fourier power spectra up to a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz . for each of these segments we measured the average frequency of the khz qpos and the position in the color - color diagram using the corresponding value of @xmath2 .",
    "following mndez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we produced a dynamic power spectrum for each observation , and we identified those power spectra that showed strong qpos at frequencies @xmath47 hz .",
    "when two qpos were present in a power spectrum , we selected the one at lower frequency , @xmath48 , which was generally the strongest .",
    "we fitted the power spectra with khz qpos in the range @xmath49 hz to @xmath50 hz , using a function consisting of a constant plus one lorentzian . in a few of these 64-s segments",
    "the qpo was not statistically significant ( less than @xmath51 , single trial ) . in these cases we averaged several contiguous 64 s segments , but always less than 20 , to increase the statistical significance of the detection .",
    "we did not combine more than 20 consecutive power spectra to avoid systematic effects ( e.g.  an artificial broadening ) in the measurements due to the variation of the qpo frequencies , which can change by a few tens of hz within a few hundred seconds .",
    "we discarded those data for which this procedure did not reveal any significant khz qpo .",
    "note , however , that in this way we might also have discarded data with weak qpos , that are not significantly detected in segments of 1280 s.    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( left top panel ) we plot the frequency of the khz qpo we measured as a function of the source intensity in the 216 kev band ( the intensity is in crab units ) .",
    "we believe that this qpo was always the lower khz qpo because in our data this was always the strongest one ( a comparison between the rms amplitudes of both khz qpos is in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , top panel ) .",
    "at least two parallel tracks are visible in this figure , demonstrating that there is a complex long - term relation between khz qpo frequencies and source count rate .",
    "different colors correspond to different dataset ; p10088 ( from 1996 april 27 to 1996 april 30 , corresponding to the red points at the low - flux level ) , p10072 ( data taken in 1996 may 29 , black points ) ; p10088 ( from 1996 november 9 to 1997 january 6 , corresponding to the red points at the high - flux level ) ; p30053 ( 1998 february 2425 and 1998 august 1920 , gray points ) . on long timescales , the source does not move randomly on the khz frequency versus flux diagram , but jumps back and forth between the same two tracks .",
    "although the observations are not always continuous , we can see that at the beginning of our observing period in april 1996 the source is found at the low flux level , where it remains till the end of may 1996 , then it jumps to the high - flux track where it stays from 1996 november 9 to 1997 january 6 , and finally the source comes back to the low - flux track where it is found in 1998 february 2425 and 1998 august 1920 .",
    "the difference in intensity between these two tracks is @xmath1 , similar to the intensity shift observed in the hardness - intensity diagram . indeed",
    "the tracks at low and high flux levels correspond , respectively , to the data points at the left - hand ends of the hardness - intensity diagram , where the same @xmath1 intensity shift is observed .",
    "these two parallel tracks almost overlap each other when we plot the lower peak frequency against the colors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , bottom panels ) or @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , right top panel ) .",
    "however , significant shifts between different observations are still visible in these plots . in particular , datasets corresponding to lower flux levels are found towards the left ( closer to the island state ) in the color - color diagram ( i.e.  at lower @xmath2 values ) , while data corresponding to higher flux levels have slightly higher @xmath2 values .",
    "similar systematic shifts are also observed in the plots of the khz qpo frequency versus hard and soft colors , with the source having higher hard colors and lower soft colors at low flux levels , and vice versa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the shifts in the qpo frequencies vs.  @xmath2 diagram are almost certainly due to the fact that we consider a single spline across the color - color diagram , while there are two different atoll tracks corresponding to the two different flux levels .",
    "note however that there is an intrinsic spread in the qpo frequency vs.   soft color and vs.  @xmath2 relations within the dataset p30053 ( gray points ) , although these all show the same flux level and seem to belong to the same atoll track .",
    "although the data show some scatter , the frequency of the khz qpo seems to be slightly anticorrelated with the hard color ; fitting a line to the hard color vs.  frequency relation significantly improves the fit with respect to a constant function ; the slope is different from zero at the @xmath52 level for the dataset p10088 ( red points ) , and at the @xmath53 level for the dataset p30053 ( gray points ) .",
    "the khz qpo frequency is slightly correlated with the intensity , whereas there is no significant correlation between the khz qpo frequency and the soft color or @xmath2 . on several occasions",
    "we also detected the upper khz qpo , either directly in the dynamical power spectrum , or in the average power spectrum of an observation . to increase the significance of this qpo and to facilitate measuring its parameters",
    ", we needed to average several 64-s power spectra . because there seems to be no clear correlation between the frequency of the khz qpos and @xmath2",
    ", we used the frequency of the lower khz qpo to group the power spectra . following the procedure described in mndez et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , we aligned the individual power spectra according to the frequency of the lower peak , we collected them into groups such that the frequency of this qpo did not vary by more than @xmath54 hz , and we calculated the average power spectrum for each group . because we want now to measure the rms amplitudes of the qpos , here we only used data for which the full energy band was available ; based on this requirement we discarded observation p10072 , corresponding to @xmath55 of the data .",
    "( note that this restriction was not necessary before because then we only measured the qpo frequencies ) .",
    "the measured frequencies , rms amplitudes , and quality factors of both khz qpos are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] as a function of the lower peak frequency .",
    "the frequency of the lower peak ranges between 780 and 910 hz .",
    "the rms amplitude of the lower peak is approximately constant ( or slowly decreasing ) up to @xmath56 hz , and then gradually decreases from @xmath57 to @xmath58 while @xmath48 increases from @xmath59 hz to @xmath60 hz . the upper peak was significantly detected only for @xmath61  hz .",
    "its frequency increases from @xmath62 to @xmath63 hz when the frequency of the lower peak increases from @xmath64 hz to @xmath60 hz , while its rms amplitude remains constant around @xmath65 .",

    "the difference between the frequencies of the khz qpos generally decreases from @xmath70 hz to @xmath71 hz , although the decrease , when compared with the associated uncertainties , is significant only at a @xmath72 level ( an f - test yields a probability in favor of the hypothesis that the frequency difference decreases of @xmath73 ) .",
    "although the decrease is not highly statistical significant , the trend shown by 636 is in agreement with the trend shown by other sources ( see fig .  [",

    "as already noted in the previous section , some shifts are present in the color - color diagram of all the data combined . in principle",
    "we could try to correct for this by drawing two splines , one for each of the two parallel tracks , as it is usually done in the case of z sources to correct for the secular shifts of the z track ( see e.g.   kuulkers et al .",
    "1994 ; jonker et al .  1998 ; jonker et al .",

    ". this difference might be due to the presence of an extra component , i.e.  the very low frequency lorentzian , in interval 9 high - flux , which absorbs part of the power .",
    "however , looking at the combined rms amplitude of the vlfn and very low frequency lorentzian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4b ] , bottom panel ) , we can see that the total ( very low frequency ) rms amplitude of interval 9 low - flux is still higher ( at @xmath212 confidence level ) than that of interval 9 high - flux . on the other hand ,",
    "no significant differences are visible between intervals 8 low - flux and 8 high - flux . in 4 out of the 10 intervals we significantly detected an excess of power between 0.01 and 0.1 hz with respect to the power law used to fit the vlfn .",
    "we fitted this excess with a ( broad ) lorentzian , the parameters of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4b ] ( top and middle panels ) .",
    "the rms amplitude of this feature is between 1% and 1.5% ( except for intervals 2 and 3 where it is @xmath213 ) , the quality factor @xmath78 is rather low ( less than 0.8 ) , and the characteristic frequency , @xmath77 , is between 20 and 30 mhz .",
    "the addition of this feature did not significantly improve the fit in intervals 8 low - flux , 9 low - flux and 10 .",
    "in particular , in intervals 8 low - flux and 9 low - flux , the @xmath68 confidence level upper limits on the very low frequency lorentzian rms amplitude are @xmath214 , which is significantly lower than the rms amplitudes measured for most of the other intervals .",
    "the parameters of the bln are plotted versus @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . the rms amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , top panel ) decreases from 4% to @xmath42 with increasing @xmath2 up to @xmath46 , and above that value it seems to remain constant at @xmath42 .",

    "the quality factor @xmath78 of the bln ( fig .",

    "the rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo slightly increases in intervals 1 to 3 ( @xmath225 , @xmath226 hz ) , and then significantly decreases from @xmath224 to @xmath37 at higher @xmath2 ( intervals 4 and 5 ) . the small differences with respect to the khz qpos rms",
    "amplitudes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] are due to the different way in which the power spectra were grouped and averaged together in the two cases . using the @xmath2 values to group the power spectra ,",
    "we could average together more power spectra ; this allows us to see the upper peak up to higher frequencies , but also introduces an artificial broadening of the qpos due to the fact that their frequencies change with @xmath2 .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath0 ks of rxte data of 636 taken between april 1996 and february 1999 .",
    "we studied the correlated spectral and timing properties of this source using broad band ( 4 mhz to 2048 hz ) power spectra extracted at different positions of the source in the color - color diagram .",
    "the most notable results of this work are : a ) the presence of shifts , due to secular motion of the atoll track , in both the hardness - intensity and color - color diagrams ; b ) the presence of parallel tracks in the khz qpo frequency versus intensity diagram ; for the first time we see that these tracks do not overlap perfectly when plotted versus colors or @xmath2 ; this is probably a consequence of the secular motion of the atoll track mentioned above ; c ) the deviation of the vlfn - component shape from a pure power law in some of the intervals ; d ) the characteristic frequency @xmath77 of the bln shows a general trend to decrease with increasing @xmath2 in the upper banana , i.e.  when khz qpos are not significantly detected any more . in the following",
    "we will discuss these and other results in more detail .",
    "all the observations analyzed here belong to the same pca gain epoch , pca gain epoch 3 , and therefore only small gain changes are expected .",
    "we used crab observations taken close to the date of our observations to correct the colors and intensity of 636 for these small instrumental effects .",
    "the corrected color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams show significant long - term shifts of the atoll track .",
    "secular shifts in both the colors and the intensity in 636 were previously reported by prins & van der klis ( 1997 ) using exosat observations .",
    "we find that the shifts are more evident in the hardness - intensity diagram , where we observe two parallel branches in the upper banana , corresponding to two different intensity levels ; it is also possible that the whole atoll track , and not just the upper banana branch , has shifted during the 1999 and part of the 1996 and 1998 observations , which correspond to the low - intensity levels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . because the shift at the lower banana ( left hand of the diagram ) is along the track",
    ", we can not clearly distinguish it from the movement of the source along the track .",
    "however , the presence of a shift in this part of the diagram is confirmed by the two - branch distribution of the khz qpo frequencies versus intensity diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "these shifts are much smaller but still visible in the color - color diagram , where the upper banana branch has significantly moved towards lower soft colors ( and probably higher hard colors ) during the 1999 observations .    correlated to the long - term shifts of the atoll track , in the khz qpo frequency vs.  count rate diagram two parallel tracks are observed corresponding to two different flux levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . during the period of time spanned by our observations ,",
    "about 2.5 years , 636 is observed to move back and forth ( once ) between these two tracks ; therefore for this source there seem to exist two preferred flux levels at which khz qpos are significantly detected .",
    "these two tracks tend to overlap each other if we plot the khz qpo frequency vs.  the colors or @xmath2 , although there are significant offsets still visible in the plots .",
    "these offsets are more noticeable in the plot vs.  @xmath2 or vs.  the soft color , whereas they are less evident , although still present , in the plot vs.   the hard color . despite these shifts ,",
    "the observed behavior is in general consistent with the hypothesis that khz qpo frequencies depend only on the position of the source in the atoll track , irrespective of the motion of the track as a whole .",
    "however , the spread within the dataset p30053 ( right hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) indicates that there may be a more complex relation between khz qpo frequencies and @xmath2 or that the spline we chose does not go correctly through all these points .",
    "another possibility is that there are shifts on a timescale of weeks / months of the atoll track in the color - color diagram along the soft color axis ( not corresponding to evident intensity shifts , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) that are not clearly seen in the diagram because they occur along the banana branch .",
    "the behavior observed in 636 is similar to the secular motion of the z - track observed in the z - sources cyg x2 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1996 ) , gx 51 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1994 ) , gx 340 + 0 ( kuulkers & van der klis 1996 ) , and gx 17 + 2 ( wijnands et al .  1997b",
    "; homan et al .  2002 ) . in these sources shifts in intensity in hardness - intensity diagrams",
    "are also reflected in ( sometimes ) much smaller , but still significant , shifts in the colors in color - color diagrams .",
    "these variations have been interpreted in terms of a high inclination angle of these sources , which would allow matter near the equatorial plane to modify the emission from the central region ( e.g.  kuulkers et al .",
    "however , as noted by van der klis ( 2001 ) , they could also be a consequence of a more general behavior of lmxb accretion , the same behavior that produces the parallel tracks in the khz qpo frequencies vs.  x - ray flux diagram .",
    "indeed , our analysis confirms that secular motion of the atoll track produces the parallel tracks in 636 .    as a possible explanation for all this phenomenology , van der klis ( 2001 ) proposed",
    "that khz qpo frequencies , as well as other timing and spectral parameters , to first order depend on the disk inner radius , which is determined by the disk accretion rate normalized by its own long - term average , as could be expected in a radiative disk truncation scenario if luminosity responds , in part , ` sluggishly ' to disk accretion rate changes . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is simply produced by the total accretion rate plus , possibly , nuclear burning .",
    "this can be the case if part of the accreted matter escapes from the disk and flows in radially , at a rate that reflects a long term average of the disk accretion rate , and some mechanism ( e.g.  radiation drag ) makes the inner disk radius dependent on the ratio of luminosity to disk accretion rate . in this scenario ,",
    "the fact that the color - color diagram is also ( but less ) affected by the jump in the x - ray flux ( visible in the hardness - intensity diagram ) indicates that the x - ray spectral properties are mainly , but probably not completely , determined by the inner radius of the disk instead of by the total mass accretion rate . in other words , changes in the flux level not affecting the frequencies of the khz qpos ( i.e.  the inner disk radius ) may only slightly affect the position in the color - color diagram .",
    "we studied the broad band ( 4 mhz - 2048 hz frequency range ) power spectra of 636 as a function of the position of the source in the color - color diagram .",
    "all power spectra are characteristic of the lower and upper banana states in atoll sources .",
    "only three main components are observed in these power spectra , the vlfn , the bln , and one or two khz qpos . since there is a shift in the upper part of the banana in the hardness - intensity diagram , due to the @xmath1 shift of the x - ray flux , for intervals 8 and 9 we extracted two different power spectra corresponding to the two different flux levels .",
    "we find that power spectra corresponding to the same position in the color - color diagram but at different flux levels are quite similar to each other .",
    "the main difference is in the strength of the very low frequency lorentzian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4b ] ) , which has an rms amplitude around @xmath227 at high flux level , and less than @xmath214 at low flux level . a minor difference (",
    "if any ) is in the fractional rms amplitude of the noise components ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] ) : the rms amplitudes are slightly ( @xmath228 ) higher for interval 9 low - flux than for 9 high - flux .",
    "note , however , that if we calculate the absolute rms amplitudes ( i.e.  the fractional rms amplitude multiplied by the flux ) , these are perfectly compatible between interval 9 low - flux and 9 high - flux .",
    "we observe one or two khz qpos only in the lower part of the banana branch , up to @xmath229 . for @xmath230",
    "hz the upper peak is not significantly detected , whereas we still detect the lower khz qpo down to @xmath231 hz .",
    "the rms amplitude of the lower peak is approximately constant up to @xmath56 hz ( which is close to the frequency at which the upper peak begins to be significantly detected ) , and then gradually decreases while @xmath48 increases .",
    "the rms amplitude of the upper peak is consistent with being constant up to @xmath232 hz , and then it significantly decreases when the lower peak frequency increases further ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this is similar to what is observed in other atoll sources ( see e.g.  mndez et al .  2001 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ) , where the rms amplitudes of the khz qpos remain constant or increase at low frequencies , and decrease at high frequencies . in 4u",
    "172834 and 4u 160852 the amplitude of the upper khz qpo decreases monotonically with frequency , whereas the rms amplitude of lower khz qpo first increases , and then decreases with frequency . in these two sources",
    "the rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo is usually larger than that of the lower khz qpo . on the contrary , in 636",
    "the rms amplitude of the lower peak is always larger than that of the upper peak ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3b ] ) ; this is probably because during these observations the khz qpos are at relatively high frequencies , where the lower peak becomes more prominent than the upper peak ( cf .",
    "3a in di salvo et al .",
    "note also that for all these sources ( including 636 ) the rms amplitude of the khz qpos is nearly constant in the frequency range in which only one of them is detected .",
    "we have also measured the frequency separation , @xmath233 , between the khz qpos , when both of them were present simultaneously . in agreement with mndez et",
    "al .  ( 1998a ) we find that @xmath233 in 636 is always significantly smaller than @xmath234 hz , half the frequency of the quasi - coherent oscillations observed during type - i x - ray bursts in this source ( see e.g.  strohmayer et al .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed in another atoll source , 4u 172834 , where @xmath233 is always significantly smaller than the frequency of the nearly coherent oscillations observed in this source during type - i x - ray bursts , even at the lowest inferred mass accretion rate , when @xmath233 seems to reach its maximum value ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) . in 636 , as well as in other similar sources , @xmath233 decreases as the khz qpo frequencies increase ( van der klis et al .  1997",

    "1998 ; homan et al .  2002",
    "; jonker et al .  2002b",
    "; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3b ] ) .",
    "this trend can not be explained by a simple beat frequency model , since in such model @xmath233 should be constant and equal to the neutron star spin frequency . among the different beat frequency models that have been proposed ( e.g.  strohmayer et al .  1996 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 ; campana 2000 ; cui 2000 ) , so far only the sonic - point beat frequency model can explain such an offset ( lamb & miller 2001 ; see , however , jonker et al .",
    "2002a ) . a decrease of the peak separation towards high , as well as towards low , frequencies is also predicted by the relativistic periastron precession model for the khz qpos ( stella & vietri 1999 ) .",
    "however , this model shows sometimes severe problems to fit the observed decrease , yielding reasonable fits only when allowing for highly eccentric orbits ( homan et al .",
    "2002 ) . the observational evidence that the khz qpo frequencies are approximately in a 2:3 frequency ratio led to the model based on parametric resonance between the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies in a relativistic accretion disk proposed by kluniak & abramowicz 2002 ( see also abramowicz et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this model",
    "the difference @xmath233 is not expected to be constant or equal to the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "however , if the khz qpo frequencies stay in a constant ratio , @xmath235 , then their difference @xmath233 should be correlated to the frequencies of the khz qpos , and not anticorrelated as is observed .",
    "note , in fact , that there are evidences of a second peak at a value of @xmath236 in the distribution of the ratio @xmath237 in the case of sco x1 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "2002 ) ; this high ratio might be due to the fact that the frequency difference decreases at high khz qpo frequencies .",
    "as in other atoll sources , the rms amplitude of the vlfn increases when the source moves towards the upper banana branch , although in 636 it seems to saturate at high @xmath2 values .",
    "we found that in some of the intervals the vlfn shows a shape that is more complex than a simple power law , because of the presence of a bump around a frequency between 20 and 30 mhz .",
    "we fitted this bump using a lorentzian , although it could also be due to a change in the slope of the power law describing the vlfn .",
    "this feature is not always significantly detected ; it seems to be stronger in intervals 4 to 7 , with rms amplitudes between 1 and @xmath238 , while it is much weaker in intervals 2 and 3 , where its rms amplitude is @xmath239 . in the intervals at the low - flux level the addition of this feature",
    "does not improve the fit , and the @xmath68 upper limits on its rms amplitudes are @xmath214 .",
    "deviations of the vlfn shape from a straight power law were previously observed in some atoll sources ; wiggles or bumps at a frequency around 0.1 hz were particularly evident in the power spectra of the bright atoll sources gx 13 + 1 , gx 9 + 9 , and gx 9 + 1 ( see hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "note that 636 shows a mhz qpo at a quite stable frequency between 7 and 9 mhz , which is probably associated to some special mode of nuclear burning at the neutron star surface ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2000 ; yu & van der klis 2002 ) , and there might be a relation between this mhz qpo and the bump observed in the vlfn .",
    "indeed both features show similar rms amplitudes of @xmath37 .",
    "however , while the mhz qpo is almost always present , with similar centroid frequencies ( even in data separated by years ) , in the light curve of 636 , the vlfn bump is not equally stable in frequency and in rms amplitude . in particular",
    ", it does not seem to be present in the intervals at the low - flux level , while it is still detected with statistical significance in the corresponding intervals at high - flux level .",
    "the last feature we want to discuss is the bln , which is always significantly detected in the power spectra of 636 .",
    "we fitted it with a lorentzian , with a low quality factor ( always less than 0.5 ) ; its rms amplitude generally decreases from @xmath58 to @xmath42 with increasing @xmath2 , in line with the general behavior observed in atoll sources ( e.g.   hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . in agreement with previous results ( prins & van der klis 1997 ) , we find that the frequency @xmath77 of the bln reaches quite high values , between 50 and 100 hz , for @xmath240 , among the highest ever observed for the bln ( typical values at high inferred accretion rates are 3060 hz , e.g.  belloni et al .  2002 ) .    to compare our results on 636 with those obtained for other sources we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] the characteristic frequencies of the features observed in the 636 power spectra ( open black symbols ) , together with those observed in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 ( filled gray symbols , from van straaten et al .",
    "2002 ) , versus the frequency of the upper khz qpo , @xmath241 . in this figure",
    "we can distinguish the following features , from the top to the bottom : the lower khz qpo ( squares ) ; the hectohertz qpo , a peaked noise component with a quite constant frequency of @xmath242 hz ( stars ) ; the lfqpo ( triangles ) , which weakens at high values of @xmath241 and disappears for @xmath243 hz ; and the bln ( circles ) . in 4u 172834",
    "this last feature seems to become peaked for @xmath244 hz : di salvo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) interpreted these results supposing that the noise component at low inferred accretion rates turns into a qpo at higher accretion rates , while what was called the lfqpo at low accretion rates gradually disappears at higher accretion rates . therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] we marked the characteristic frequencies of this feature at high accretion rates with triangles and we will call it `` second lfqpo '' ( note that the centroid frequency of this feature is approximately , but not exactly , half the frequency of the first lfqpo , so we can not exclude it is a subharmonic of the first lfqpo ) . simultaneously , another noise component appears , with a characteristic frequency of @xmath245 hz ; these points are marked with circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the lower khz qpo in 636 follows the same correlation as that observed for the lower khz qpo in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "the frequency of the bln in 636 follows a similar correlation to that observed for the lfqpo in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 . therefore , on the basis of these correlations , the bln in 636 can be tentatively identified with the feature that is called second lfqpo in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 . in the framework of the relativistic precession model",
    ", the lfqpo is interpreted as the lense - thirring precession frequency of the ( slightly tilted ) inner parts of the accretion disk , not coaligned with the equatorial plane of the neutron star , around the angular momentum axis of the neutron star ( stella & vietri 1998 ) ; according to the magnetospheric beat - frequency model , this would be the frequency difference between the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric radius and the spin frequency of the neutron star ( psaltis et al .",
    "1999b ) . in both these interpretations , the frequency of this feature",
    "is expected to increase with increasing inferred mass accretion rate , i.e.  with decreasing inner radius of the disk .",
    "however , from the correlation between the bln frequency and @xmath2 in 636 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) , we see that @xmath77 tends to decrease at high values of @xmath2 ( @xmath246 , note that the khz qpos in this source disappear for @xmath247 ) .",
    "note , however , that we do not fit any hectohertz qpo in 636 ( the addition of this component is not statistically required ) , and this might affect our measures of the characteristic frequencies of the bln if the hectohertz qpo is present and not resolved . indeed time variability seems much weaker in 636 than in 4u 172834 ; a comparison between the power spectra of 4u 172834 and 636 at similar khz qpo frequencies ( i.e. for @xmath248 hz ) shows that the total rms amplitude is higher in 4u 172834 than in 636 .",
    "however , it is not easy to see whether this is because some of the components are missing in the 636 power spectrum , or all the rms amplitudes are genuinely lower in 636 than in 4u 172834 .",
    "note that , for @xmath248 hz , 636 and 4u 172834 show similar rms amplitudes of the upper and lower khz qpo ( respectively , @xmath249 and @xmath250 in 636 and @xmath251 and @xmath252 in 4u 172834 ) and of the vlfn ( @xmath253 in 636 and @xmath254 in 4u 172834 , cf .  di salvo et al .",
    "hence it is possible that some of the time variability components are missing in 636 .",
    "indeed a decrease of the characteristic frequency of the bln in the upper banana after the disappearance of the khz qpos may have been observed in some other similar sources .",
    "for instance , in 4u  182030 the cutoff frequency of the cutoff power law used to describe the bln was observed to decrease from @xmath255 to @xmath256 hz along the banana ( wijnands et al .",
    "further in the banana this noise component evolved first into a broad peaked noise and then into a qpo at a frequency of @xmath257 hz ( this behavior is , however , not observed in 636 , where this component is always quite broad ) .    jumps to lower values in the frequency of the bln",
    "have been observed in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 ( ford & van der klis 1998 ; van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ; van straaten et al .  2002b",
    "; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) . also , the noise observed in the upper banana , when the khz qpos are no longer detected , is not easily identified in these sources .",
    "this is because the power spectra of these sources are very complex ( showing several noise components and qpos ) in the island state and lower banana branch , while they become quite simple ( showing only vlfn and bln ) in the upper banana ; it is not easy therefore to keep track of the evolution of all these components . on the other hand , in the case of 636 the power spectra are much simpler than in other sources already in the lower banana branch , and this allows us to keep track of the evolution of the bln frequency . if we tentatively identify in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 the bln present in the upper banana with the second lfqpo ( as we do in 636 ) , then in 4u 172834 at the transition to the upper banana , when the khz qpos are no longer detected and the vlfn becomes dominant , the frequency of this feature significantly decreases from @xmath258 hz to @xmath259 hz and then to @xmath260 hz , while in 4u 0614 + 09 it decreases from @xmath261 hz to @xmath262 hz ( van straaten et al .",
    "2002b ; see also van straaten et al .",
    "2000 ; di salvo et al .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , we can speculate that this feature evolves from a noise component to a qpo and then again to a noise component in 4u  172834 and maybe in 4u 0614 + 09 , while it is always quite broad in 636 .",
    "a similar behavior may also have been observed in z sources : a decrease of the hbo frequency with increasing @xmath263 was in fact observed with high statistical significance in the z source gx 17 + 2 , when the khz qpos were still present ( wijnands et al .",
    "1996 , homan et al .",
    "2002 ) . in that case ,",
    "the fundamental frequency of the hbo increases from @xmath218 hz to @xmath264 hz for @xmath263 increasing from 0.4 to 1.45 , and then it significantly decreases from @xmath264 hz to @xmath265 hz for @xmath263 increasing further up to @xmath35 .",
    "this change in the behavior of the hbo frequency occurred when the source was in the normal branch , at high inferred mass accretion rates , while simultaneously the frequency of the khz qpos , which are thought to track the inner radius of the disk , continued to increase ( homan et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in the framework of the general relativistic precession model this behavior may be explained in terms of the classical precession due to oblateness of the neutron star ( morsink & stella 1999 ) .",
    "however , the relation between the hbo and upper khz qpo frequencies in gx 17 + 2 would require rather extreme neutron star parameters : a high neutron star spin frequency ( 500700 hz ) , a neutron star mass larger than @xmath266 , and a hard equation of state ( see the discussion in homan et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the framework of the sonic point",
    "beat frequency model , this behavior could be explained , for instance , assuming a two - flow model ( wijnands et al .",
    "1996 ) , in which part of the accretion flow is radial outside the magnetosphere ( to explain the hbo frequency decrease ) and most of the radial flow falls back to the disk before the sonic point is reached ( to explain the increase in the khz qpo frequencies ) .",
    "however , how this should work is not clear , given that the magnetospheric radius and the sonic point radius should be close to each other .",

    "<S> we find that the very low frequency noise in some intervals is not well described by a power law because of an excess of power between 20 and 30 mhz , which can be fitted by a lorentzian . </S>",
    "<S> also , the characteristic frequency of the band limited noise shows a trend to decrease with increasing @xmath2 at high @xmath2 values . </S>"
