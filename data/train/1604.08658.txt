    "tries are one of the most fundamental tree - type data structures in computer algorithms .",
    "their general efficiency depends on several shape parameters , the principal ones including the depth , the height , the size , the internal path - length ( ipl ) , and the external path - length ( epl ) ; see below for a more precise description of those studied in this paper . while most of these measures have been extensively investigated in the literature , we are concerned here with the question : _ how does the epl depend on the size in a random trie ?",
    "_ surprisingly , while the ipl and the size are known to have asymptotic correlation coefficient tending to one and to have the same normal limit law after each being properly normalized ( see @xcite ) , this paper aims to show that the epl exhibits a completely different behavior depending on the parameter of the underlying random bits being biased or unbiased .",
    "this is a companion paper to @xcite .",
    "given a sequence of binary strings ( or keys ) , one can construct a ( binary ) trie as follows .",
    "if @xmath2 , then the trie consists of a single root - node holding the sole string ; otherwise , the root is used to direct the strings into the corresponding subtree : if the first bit of the input string is @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) , then the string goes to the left ( or right ) subtree ; strings going to the same subtree are then constructed recursively in the same manner but instead of splitting according to the first bit , the second bit of each string is then used . in this way ,",
    "a binary dictionary - type tree with two types of nodes is constructed : external nodes for storing strings and internal nodes for splitting the strings ; see figure  [ fg - trie ] for a trie of seven strings .",

    "then the trie constructed from this sequence is a random trie .",
    "we define three shape parameters in a random trie of @xmath3 strings :    * size @xmath5 : the total number of internal nodes used ; * ipl ( or node path - length , npl ) @xmath6 : the sum of the distances between the root to each internal node ; * epl ( or key path - length , kpl ) @xmath7 : the sum of the distances between the root to each external node .",
    "we will use mostly npl in place of ipl , and kpl in place of epl , the reason being an easier comparison with the corresponding results in random @xmath8-ary search trees in the companion paper @xcite ; see below for more details .    by the recursive definition , we have the following recurrence relations @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 , and @xmath13 are independent copies of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "while many stochastic properties of these random variables are known ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , much less attention has been paid to their correlation and dependence structure .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of the moments of random variables defined on tries typically depend on the ratio @xmath16 being rational or irrational , where @xmath17 .",
    "so we introduce , similar to @xcite , the notation @xmath18(z )      = \\begin{cases } {          \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{z}}g_k          z^{-\\chi_k } } , & { \\text{if\\ }          \\frac{\\log p}{\\log q}\\in\\mathbb{q}};\\\\          g_0 , & {          \\text{if\\ } \\frac{\\log p}{\\log q}\\not\\in\\mathbb{q } } ,      \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 represents a sequence of coefficients and @xmath20 when @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 coprime . in simpler words , @xmath24(z)$ ] is a periodic function in the rational case , and a constant in the irrational case .",
    "we also use @xmath25(z)$ ] as a generic symbol if the exact form of underlying sequence matters less , and in this case each occurrence may not represent the same function .    with this notation , the asymptotics of the mean and",

    "finally , similar results as those in this paper also hold for other digital families of trees , but for simplicity we focus on tries in this paper ; see @xcite for more references .",
    "in this section , we sketch the main ideas leading to the proof of theorem [ main - thm-1 ] on the asymptotics of the covariance and correlation coefficient of @xmath5 and @xmath7 . for the latter , we also need the variances of @xmath5 and @xmath7 which have been known for a long time ; see jacquet and rgnier @xcite , kirschenhofer and prodinger @xcite , kirschenhofer et al .",

    ", the manipulation can be largely simplified by the additional notions of poissonized variance and admissible functions further developed in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the recurrence satisfied by @xmath5 and @xmath7 in ( [ dist - rec ] ) .",
    "a standard means in the computation of moments of @xmath5 and @xmath7 is the poisson generating function , which corresponds to the moments of @xmath5 and @xmath7 with @xmath3 replaced by a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath33 ( this step is called _ poissonization _ ) .    more precisely , define the poisson generating function of @xmath34 and that of @xmath35 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "by cauchy s integral representation and analytic de - poissonization techniques @xcite , we obtain precise asymptotic approximations to @xmath34 and to @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , for the variances @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we introduce the poisson generating functions of the second moments : @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which then satisfy , by , the same type of functional equations as in but with different non - homogeneous parts . instead of computing directly asymptotic approximations to the second moments , it proves computational more advantageous to consider the poissonized variances @xmath48 and then following the same mellin - de - poissonization approach ( as for the means ) to derive the first and the third asymptotic estimate in the second column of table  [ tb - skn ] .",
    "it remains to derive the claimed estimate for the covariance .",
    "for that purpose , we then introduce the poisson generating function @xmath49 , which satisfies , again by , @xmath50 to compute the covariance , it is beneficial to introduce now the",

    "also @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",

    "if @xmath79 , then only @xmath80 is relevant and the second term ( the sum over @xmath81 ) on the right - hand side of has to be dropped .",

    "these provide an explicit expression for the periodic function @xmath94 in theorem [ main - thm-1 ] .",
