    "the proto - neutron star core or the neutron star core is a favorable environment for the conversion of ordinary matter to strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that some neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries can accrete sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to become strange stars @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been proposed by @xcite as a source of radiation emission for cosmological @xmath0-ray bursts .",

    "if strange matter is absolutely stable , pulsars would be expected to consist of quark matter .",
    "some data on pulsar properties are consistent with this assumption @xcite .",
    "the structure of a realistic strange star is very complicated , but its basic properties can be described as follows @xcite .",

    "the fermi gas of @xmath7 quarks constitutes a single color - singlet baryon with baryon number @xmath8 .",
    "this structure of the quarks leads to a net positive charge inside the star .",
    "since stars in their lowest energy state are supposed to be charge neutral , electrons must balance the net positive quark charge in strange matter stars .",
    "the electrons , being bounded to the quark matter by the electromagnetic interaction and not by the strong force , are able to move freely across the quark surface , but clearly can not move to infinity because of the electrostatic attraction of quarks . for hot stars the electron distribution could extend up to @xmath9 fm above the quark surface @xcite .",
    "photon emissivity is the basic parameter for determining macroscopic properties of stellar type objects .",
    "@xcite have shown that , because of very high plasma frequency @xmath10 near the strange matter edge , photon emissivity of strange matter is very low .",
    "only photons produced just below the surface , in a quark layer of approximately @xmath11 fm , and with momenta pointing outwards , can leave strange matter . for temperatures @xmath12 , where @xmath13 mev is the characteristic transverse plasmon cutoff energy ,",

    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity of quark matter has been estimated by @xcite .",
    "they have found that the surface radiation is about four orders of magnitude weaker than the equilibrium black body radiation , even they both have the same temperature dependence .",
    "the problem of the soft photon emissivity of quark matter at the surface of strange stars has been reconsidered in @xcite . by taking into account the effect of the interference of amplitudes of nearby interactions in a dense media ( the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ) and the absorption of the radiation in the external electron layer",
    ", the emissivity of the quark matter can be six orders of magnitude lower than the equilibrium black body radiation .",
    "the coulomb barrier at the quark surface of a hot strange star may also be a powerful source of @xmath15 pairs , which are created in the extremely strong electric field of the barrier . at surface temperatures of around @xmath16",
    "k , the luminosity of the outflowing plasma may be of the order @xmath17 ergs@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "moreover , as shown by @xcite , for about one day for normal quark matter and for up to a hundred years for superconducting quark matter , the thermal luminosity from the star surface , due to both photon emission and @xmath15 pair production may be orders of magnitude higher than the eddington limit .",
    "the existence of another major source of energy from a bare strange star , namely , the bremsstrahlung photon emission from the high - density electron layer at the surface of the star , has been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the electron layer could be an important source of photons , which , due to the extremely low emissivity of quark - gluon plasma , could be the main observational signature of strange stars .",
    "the extreme - relativistic electrons of the electron layer undergo several types of collisions .",
    "the most important processes are the electron - electron elastic scattering , electron - photon scattering ( compton scattering ) , and electron - electron bremsstrahlung ( together with its inverse ) . of these three , the first two are assumed , on the average , to cause no net change of the gas , i.e.",
    ", the electron and photon distributions remain unchanged .",
    "hence the most important effect leading to the creation and subsequent loss of radiation in the electrosphere of the quark stars is the bremsstrahlung emission .    since the electrons in the electrosphere of the bare strange stars have a high density , the effect of the dense medium plays an important role on the electromagnetic emission of the thin electron layer .",
    "the intensity of radiation from high density systems can be significantly reduced by the so - called landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , which takes into account the effect of multiple collisions on the intensity of the emitted radiation .",
    "the influence of the lpm effect for the bremsstrahlung emisivity of the electrosphere has been discussed in @xcite and it has been shown that the effect of the dense medium can reduce the emissivity by two orders of magnitude .    it is the purpose of the present paper to consider a systematic analysis of the lpm effect in the electrosphere of the bare quark stars . in particular , we would like to point out the effect of the electric field at the quark star surface on the electromagnetic radiation from the electrosphere .",
    "the presence of the electric field considerably reduces the magnitude of the lpm effect ( for example , the critical lpm frequency is reduced , due to the electric field , from @xmath19 gev to a few mev ) .",
    "the radiation properties of the electrosphere essentially depend on the value of the electric potential at the quark star surface . for high values of the electric potential ( of the order of @xmath20 mev or higher ) ,",
    "the electrosphere can be considered , from the point of view of the lpm effect , as a thick medium , and radiation is strongly suppressed in almost the entire volume of the electrosphere . on the other hand , for small values of the surface electrostatic potential of the quark star the electrosphere becomes thin and the suppression effect can be ignored .",

    "ii we review the basic formalism and the main results describing the radiation spectrum of the individual electrons by taking into account the lpm effect .",

    "in particular , we shall describe in some details the mechanisms of electromagnetic radiation suppression due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in the case of electrons in a dense medium @xcite , with and without the presence of an external electric field .",
    "this effect plays an essential role in the calculation of the radiation emission from the electrosphere of the quark star .",
    "the emission of a photon in the electrosphere of a quark star is the result of the scattering of an electron from a state @xmath22 to a state @xmath23 by collision with another particle of momentum @xmath24 . in order to calculate the photon emissivity due to electron collisions in the electrosphere of quark stars we consider the rate of collisions @xmath25 in which a soft photon of energy @xmath26 is emitted . according to the general principles of quantum electrodynamics the rate of collisions",

    "the suppression effect is of quantum mechanic nature and has its roots in the uncertainty principle .",
    "the kinematics of the bremsstrahlung requires that the longitudinal momentum transfer between the interacting particles must be small ; the uncertainty principle then requires that the interaction must occur over a large longitudinal distance scale ( formation zone ) .",
    "if the electron coulomb scatters while traversing this zone , the bremsstrahlung amplitude from before and after scattering can interfere , thus reducing the amplitude for bremsstrahlung photon emission ( @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "since the proposal of strange quark stars , much effort has been devoted to find major observational properties that distinguish strange stars from neutron stars .",
    "one of the important difference between them is the stellar radius .",
    "strange stars could have a radius significantly smaller than that of neutron stars .",
    "the observed thermal x - ray properties of compact objects may be a possible probe to determine the stellar radius . in the present paper",
    "we have shown that the high - density degenerate electron layer at the surface of a bare strange star could play an important role in the electromagnetic radiation emission from the star .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity of the electrosphere is generally a function of the electron density , temperature and of the electrostatic potential at the surface of the star .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission spectrum is very different from the black body spectrum . for hot strange stars ,",
    "the energy emission from the electrosphere could exceed the intensity of the black body radiation .",
    "even in the low temperature limit the photon emission from the electron layer exceeds the bremsstrahlung emissivity of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this makes the process of electron - electron bremsstrahlung of considerable importance for establishing the correct observational signatures of quark stars . since the photon emission from the strange star s surface",
    "is dominated by the bremsstrahlung emission from the electron layer , it is necessary to include this effect in determining the radius of the star .",
    "one of the important features of the bremsstrahlung radiation from a single interaction is the independence of @xmath275 on @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "but , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ est ] ) , in the case of the strongly suppressed radiation of a particle in a dense medium we have @xmath276 .",
    "therefore , due to the multiple scattering effects , the spectrum of the radiation of the dense electrosphere differs in a qualitative way of the standard bremsstrahlung . on the other hand the electric field of the electrosphere decreases the lpm critical frequency , thus leading to an increase of the electromagnetic energy flux from the bare strange star surface .",
    "the results on the bremsstrahlung radiation of the electrosphere obtained in the present paper have been obtained under two main assumptions .",
    "firstly , we have considered the equations for the radiation emission process derived for the case of a constant electric field .",
    "the electric field in the electrosphere is not constant and the in order to take in account the variations of @xmath86 and of the energies of the electrons we have adopted the mean values of these quantities .",
    "this approximation is of course not generally valid for all layers of the electrosphere , but we still expect that it can provide a general description of the radiation pattern of the electron layer . secondly , in describing the lpm effect , we have adopted for the electrons the formulas and equations describing multiple coulomb scattering in amorphous media , where the main contribution to scattering comes from fixed centers , such as the nuclei or the crystalline lattice . to apply this well - established formalism to the case of the electrosphere of the strange stars we have assumed that the multiple scattering processes between electrons can be described by taking @xmath277 in the equations describing multiple collisions and radiation suppression in amorphous media . in other words",
    ", we approximate the multiple collision and scattering processes between electrons in the dense electrosphere as scattering of an electron on a fixed center . the differences between these physical processes could affect the numerical estimations for the suppression factor , critical lpm frequency and radiation spectrum obtained in the present paper .",
    "however , we expect that the results obtained in the present paper could give a good qualitative description of the radiation emission processes from the electrosphere .",
    "the radiation properties of the electrosphere and the lpm suppression effect essentially depend on the numerical value of the electrostatic potential at the quark star surface @xmath278 , which at low temperatures is related to the quark electric potential @xmath168 in the bulk .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that because of the attractive interaction between quarks in some specific channels , the ground state of the strange quark matter is a color superconductor , which , at asymptotic densities , is in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase , in which quarks of all three flavors and three colors are paired in a single condensate . the cfl phase in the bulk",
    "consists of equal numbers of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks and is electrically neutral in the absence of any electrons , that is , in this state @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , for strange stars in the cfl phase there could be no surface electron layer , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the density of quark states near the surface of a strange star differs from the density of quark states in the bulk @xcite .",
    "this results in a sharp increase of quark charge density at the star s surface . because of the surface depletion of the @xmath6 quarks , a thin charged layer forms at the surface of the star . due to this surface effect the electric field and",
    "the density of electrons could increase by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the surface or other effects in the electrosphere models would also require the reconsideration of the radiation emission processes by taking into account their influence on the radiation suppression mechanisms and on the critical lpm frequency .",
