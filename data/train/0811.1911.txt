    "generating initial state parton showers ( ips ) in hadronic collisions at the nlo accuracy is a task for which no satisfactory solution has so far been found .",
    "an attempt at solving this problem which is presented in this contribution is based on an exploitation of the freedom in the choice of the factorization scheme .    as a simple illustration ,",
    "consider a non  singlet nucleon structure function @xmath0 .",
    "its mellin moments are given as the product @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for mellin moments of the corresponding coefficient function and @xmath3 represents mellin moments of the relevant non  singlet parton distribution function .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on a particular factorization scheme @xmath4 and on a factorization scale @xmath5 , however , their product ( [ eq1 ] ) is independent of both of them .",
    "the coefficient function @xmath2 is calculable within the framework of perturbative qcd and can thus be expanded in powers of the qcd couplant @xmath6 @xmath7 although both the couplant @xmath8 and the coefficients @xmath9 depend on a particular renormalization scheme @xmath10 and on a renormalization scale @xmath11 , which is in principle different from @xmath5 , the series , if summed to all orders , is independent of both the @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the non  singlet parton distribution function @xmath3 satisfies the evolution equation ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , we see that the non  singlet distribution function @xmath12 also depends on the renormalization scheme in which the renormalized couplant @xmath13 is defined .",
    "this scheme can in principle be different from that used for the expansion of the coefficient function @xmath2 , but usually these schemes are chosen to be identical . ]",
    "@xmath14 where the non ",
    "singlet splitting function @xmath15 can be expanded in powers of @xmath13 @xmath16    in the next  to  leading order approximation , we retain only the first two terms in the expansions ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) : @xmath17 and the nlo couplant @xmath18 obeys the differential equation @xmath19 the lo terms @xmath20 and @xmath21 are universal  independent of any unphysical quantities such as renormalization and factorization scales and schemes .",
    "the nlo contributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy the following condition @xmath24 , \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a scale and scheme factorization invariant .",
    "the ambiguity related to the factorization procedure is already at the nlo large , because the splitting function @xmath26 is completely arbitrary function  for any function @xmath27 , there always exists such a factorization scheme fs in which @xmath28 .",
    "there are two prominent choices of the splitting function @xmath29 , which are in some sense opposite to each other . in the first one ,",
    "the splitting function @xmath29 is set equal to zero .",
    "for this choice , which will be called the zero factorization scheme , the evolution of the distribution function @xmath3 is formally identical to the lo one and all nlo corrections are thus contained in the nlo coefficient function @xmath30 .",
    "the latter choice consists in selecting the splitting function @xmath29 in such a way that the nlo coefficient function @xmath30 vanishes for @xmath31 ( see the equation ( [ eq8 ] ) ) . in this case",
    ", the relation between the structure function @xmath32 and the distribution function @xmath3 has the same form as in the lo and all nlo corrections are included in the evolution of the distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "this type of choice is the essence of the so called dis factorization scheme introduced in @xcite , which is widely used in phenomenology .",
    "the factorization scheme dependence of nlo theoretical predictions for physical quantities is studied , for instance , in @xcite , where only factorization schemes interpolating between the dis and @xmath33 factorization schemes are considered .",
    "the factorization scheme specifies the way in which the so called collinear singularities , which are contained in cross  sections at parton level , are absorbed into the dressed parton distribution functions . within the framework of dimensional regularization",
    ", the relation between the dressed and bare distribution functions is given in the general case by the formula @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrices @xmath35 can be chosen arbitrarily and their choice fully specifies the factorization scheme .",
    "the factorization scheme can also be specified by higher order splitting functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , which we can choose at will .",
    "the most widely used factorization scheme is the so called @xmath33 factorization scheme , which is defined by setting the matrices @xmath35 equal to zero defined in the @xmath33 renormalization scheme ] and is thus convenient for theoretical calculations .    at present time",
    "many qcd cross  sections at parton level are known at the nlo accuracy .",
    "however , the algorithms that are used for their incorporation in monte carlo event generators attach to them the ips only at the lo accuracy because generating ips at the nlo accuracy is very complicated in the standard @xmath33 factorization scheme . the reasons for that are basically two : the nlo splitting functions no longer correspond to basic qcd vertices and the splitting functions at the nlo approximation are negative for some @xmath38 , which prevents us from using straightforward probabilistic interpretation .",
    "because the ips induce the scale dependence of parton distribution functions , it is inconsistent to attach the lo ips to nlo qcd cross  sections , which include nlo parton distribution functions .",
    "this deficiency could be removed by choosing the zero factorization scheme , in which the nlo ips are formally identical to the lo ones and all nlo corrections are thus put into hard scattering cross  sections .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is the fact that the existing algorithms for parton showering and for attaching parton showers to nlo cross  sections need not be changed .",
    "the only step necessary to do is transforming parton level cross  sections from the standard @xmath33 factorization scheme to the zero factorization scheme and determining parton distribution functions in the zero scheme .",
    "in the case of a hadron collision , a cross ",

    "which is process independent . in the space of mellin moments ,",
    "the matrix @xmath51 satisfies the following matrix equation : @xmath52 - b \\mathbf{t}^{(1)}(n , { \\rm fs } )    = \\mathbf{p}^{(1)}(n , \\overline{\\rm ms } ) - \\mathbf{p}^{(1)}(n , { \\rm fs } ) \\ , .",

    "the mellin inversion of @xmath54 has to be calculated numerically .",
    "this was performed for three and four effectively massless flavours .",
    "the obtained results are very surprising because for @xmath55 @xmath56 and the coefficients @xmath57 are so large that the functions @xmath58 strongly dominate over the nlo splitting functions @xmath59 in this region ( @xmath55 )",
    ". so the question of applicability of the zero factorization scheme arises .",
    "parton distributions at @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath33 distributions were obtained by evolving the starting distributions of the mrst98 set @xcite with the fixed number of active flavours @xmath61 ( only light flavours are taken into account ) .",
    "the zero distributions were calculated from the @xmath33 ones by using a numerical transformation method based on mellin moments .",
    "note that the gluon distributions are plotted in their absolute value because the zero gluon distribution is negative in the displayed region .",
    "the zero point where the zero gluon distribution changes the sign is close to @xmath62 . ]",
    "the parton distribution functions in the zero factorization scheme are plotted for @xmath63 in figure [ fig1 ] . in this region",
    "they behave like @xmath64 with @xmath65 close to that in the relation ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "the zero factorization scheme can thus provide reasonable predictions only if large cancellation between positive and negative values occurs in expressions for physical quantities .",
    "hence , within the framework of numerical computations , the zero factorization scheme can only be used in kinematic regions where @xmath66 .",
    "the only exception is its application in the non  singlet case , where the functions @xmath58 do not appear and no problems with large numbers occur .",
    "the zero factorization scheme is optimal for monte carlo simulations of nlo initial state parton showers . however , because of the problems with large numbers , this scheme has too little range of applicability in numerical calculations .",
    "the zero factorization scheme should thus be replaced by some `` almost zero '' factorization scheme which is sufficiently close to the zero factorization scheme and is free of problems with large numbers .",
    "searching for such a factorization scheme has already been started .",
