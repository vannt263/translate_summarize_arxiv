    "research in spintronics and carbon nanotubes sparked renewed interests in the effects of spin - orbit coupling on quantum transport @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable features of non - interacting disordered electron systems with spin - orbit coupling is the existence of a metallic phase in two dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite .",
    "more exactly the 2d metallic phase appears in systems with symplectic symmetry , i.e. , in systems with time reversal symmetry but without spin rotation symmetry .",
    "such systems are an exception to the prediction of abrahams _ et al . _ that there is no metallic phase in 2d disordered electron systems @xcite .",
    "recently some 2d metals have been discovered experimentally @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism inducing the 2d metal might be different from spin - orbit coupling , we think that detailed understanding of the 2d symplectic systems gives some insights on general transport properties of 2d metals .",
    "a scaling theory for the symplectic systems @xcite can be described by the @xmath0 function for the conductance @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the linear size of a system .",
    "( the conductance is actually a distributed quantity .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions on the scaling hypothesis of the conductance . ) because of the so - called anti - localization effect , the @xmath0 function shows non - monotonic behavior in the symplectic systems .",
    "the asymptotic behavior in the strongly metallic region in 2d is conjectured to be @xmath5 this indicates that there is a metallic phase in 2d .    in the scaling theory for the symplectic systems in 2d",
    ", however , there is a long standing problem for more than two decades @xcite : the logarithmic divergence of the conductance in the 2d metallic phase in the limit @xmath6 indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : betaasymptotic ] ) .",
    "since the conductivity and the conductance are the same quantity in 2d , this predicts a perfect conductivity , @xmath7 , in spite of the system being disordered .",
    "this is in contrast to 3d disordered metals , in which the conductivity converges to a finite value .",
    "according to the renormalization group theory of continuous phase transitions , the scaling hypothesis is valid when the correlation length is much larger than all other microscopic lengths .",
    "the scaling argument which deduced ( [ eq : betaasymptotic ] ) , however , is based on the weak localization theory in which disorder is supposed to be weak . in such a weakly disordered metallic phase this condition on the correlation length may not be satisfied . therefore , a numerical check of the scaling hypothesis in the 2d metallic region is desirable .    in this paper",
    ", we report a numerical check of the scaling hypothesis in the 2d metallic region .",
    "we also report numerical calculation of the landauer conductance in 2d , which is a direct check of the prediction of a perfect conductivity .",
    "last , numerical simulations of transport through a sierpinski carpet are reported .",

    "random spin - orbit coupling is included in the nearest neighbor hoping term . we parameterize the hopping matrix as @xmath11 and we distribute @xmath12 and @xmath13 with uniform probability in the range @xmath14 , and @xmath15 according to the probability density @xmath16 in the range @xmath17 $ ] . in the actual simulations",
    "@xmath18 s in one direction are set to the unit matrix with the aid of the local su(2 ) gauge transformation .",
    "the su(2 ) model has an advantage that corrections to scaling arising from irrelevant variables are smaller than other models @xcite , so it is quite a useful model when we study universal aspects of anderson localization and the anderson transition .",
    "we analyze the quasi-1d localization length @xmath19 on a quasi-1d strip with width @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the transverse direction .",
    "the scaling hypothesis implies that the dimensionless quantity @xmath20 obeys @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the 2d correlation ( localization ) length which depends on @xmath23 and the fermi energy @xmath24 .",

    "all data fall on a common scaling curve when @xmath26 is plotted as a function of @xmath38 , indicating the validity of the scaling hypothesis . in a strongly metallic region ( @xmath39 ) , the data are well fitted to @xmath40 as shown in fig .  [",

    "this supports the scaling theory for the 2d symplectic systems .",
    "furthermore , the logarithmic increase of @xmath26 in the strongly metallic region gives the impression that the conductance may also increase logarithmically . in this section ,",
    "we study the size dependence of the mean conductance directly .",
    "we now attach two perfect leads to the square sample with linear size @xmath4 and calculate the two terminal landauer conductance @xmath1 ( in units of @xmath2 ) with the transfer matrix method @xcite .",

    "the prefactor of the logarithmic term , which is an important parameter for the scaling in the strongly metallic region , is also consistent with it .",
    "note that a perfect conductivity does not mean perfect transmission .",
    "the transmission probability per channel rather goes to zero as @xmath4 increases , so most of incoming electrons are reflected .",
    "it is left for future to understand physics behind this possible perfect conductivity in 2d .     vs. system size @xmath4 in the 2d metallic region .",
    "the solid lines are a guide to the eye only . for a reference , @xmath47 is indicated . ]",
    "recently we have obtained numerical results which suggest that an anderson transition occurs even below 2d in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "this is based on numerical simulations of electrons on a sierpinski carpet sc(@xmath48 ) , where @xmath49 is the generation number . in the limit @xmath50 , sc(@xmath48 )",
    "becomes a true fractal whose spectral dimension is @xmath51 @xcite .    here we study the size dependence of the landauer conductance through the sierpinski carpet in a delocalized phase .",
    "we have attached two perfect leads to sc(@xmath48 ) and have calculated the conductance with the recursive green s function method @xcite .",
    "a fixed boundary condition is imposed in the transverse direction .",
    "the hopping matrices in the transverse direction are set to the unit matrix .",
