    "see @xcite .",
    "instead of giving the usual axiomatic or recursive definitions of the energy function , we will instead describe it in relation to another well known statistic on words :",
    "* cocharge*. suppose @xmath260 is a word in the letters @xmath224 .",

    "we assign an index : the @xmath59 is assigned index @xmath126 , and the index of the underlined @xmath37 is equal to the index of the underlined @xmath266 if the @xmath37 occurs to the left of the @xmath37 , otherwise the index of the @xmath37 is one more than the index of the @xmath266 . finally , we define @xmath267 where the word @xmath268 is obtained from @xmath260 by erasing all the underlined letters .",
    "we define the cocharge of the empty word to be 0 .    [",
    "ex : cc ] the cocharge of @xmath269 is calculated as follows ( indices are indicated as subscripts ) : @xmath270 thus @xmath271 .",

    "we define a crystal element @xmath274 by setting @xmath275 to be the one - row tableau with @xmath276 @xmath116 s .",
    "these @xmath277 are exactly the highest weight vectors of the affine crystal .",
    "recall that the reading word @xmath278 of a tableau is obtained by reading the rows from left to right , starting from the bottom row .",
    "the following result is due to nakayashiki and yamada @xcite .",
    "let @xmath28 be a semistandard tableaux with partition weight .",
    "then the cocharge @xmath279 of the reading word is equal to the energy @xmath280 of the corresponding crystal element .",
    "[ ex : bt ] let @xmath29{1&1&1&1&1&2&3&3\\\\2&2&2&3\\\\3}\\ ] ] then @xmath278 is the word in example [ ex : cc ] .",
    "thus the energy of @xmath281{1&1&1&1 } \\otimes \\tableau[sy]{1&2&2&2 } \\otimes \\tableau[sy]{1&1&2&3}\\ ] ] is @xmath282 .",
    "it is known that the energy function of a tensor product @xmath283 of kirillov - reshetikhin crystals commutes with the affine @xmath2-matrix . as explained in section [ sec : r ] , the ring of loop symmetric functions is exactly the ring of polynomial invariants of the birational @xmath2-matrix .",
    "nevertheless , the following result is somewhat surprising :    [ t : energy ] set @xmath284 .",
    "the energy function @xmath285 of the affine crystal @xmath283 is equal to the tropicalization of the loop schur function @xmath286 .",
    "there seems to be no _ a priori _ reason that the energy function @xmath285 should be the tropicalization of a _ polynomial _ , much less that of a loop schur function .",
    "for example [ ex : bt ] we would have @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and @xmath289 . according to theorem [ t : energy ] ,",
    "the energy is @xmath290 corresponding to the tableaux @xmath125{1&1&1&1\\\\2&2 } \\qquad \\tableau[sy]{1&1&2&3\\\\3&3 } \\qquad \\tableau[sy]{1&2&2&2\\\\2&3 } \\qquad \\cdots\\ ] ] the minimum is achieved ( uniquely ) on the tableau @xmath125{1&1&2&3\\\\2&3}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath291 , agreeing with the previous calculation .",
    "loop symmetric functions can also be thought of as integrals of motion of certain discrete dynamical systems , called box - ball systems . here",
    "the birational action of @xmath205 is the time evolution of the system .",
    "the connection between the @xmath2-matrix and the box - ball system was established in @xcite .",
    "we begin with an ( infinite ) configuration of boxes arranged on a line .",
    "each box can either contain one ball or no balls .",
    "we shall always assume that there are finitely many balls .",
    "time evolution proceeds as follows .",
    "take the leftmost ball and place it in the leftmost empty box to the right of that ball .",
    "repeatedly do this for the leftmost ball that has not yet been moved , until all balls are moved .",
    "this completes the time evolution .                while the definition is simple , the box - ball system has the remarkable property that it exhibits solitonic behavior .",
    "an isolated consecutive string of @xmath155 balls is a * soliton * which travels with speed @xmath155 .",
    "figure [ fig : bb ] shows the collision of a speed 3 solition with a speed 1 soliton .",
    "note how the faster soliton overtakes the slower one , but both solitons are preserved .",
    "the time evolution of the box - ball system can also be described in terms of a carrier .",
    "imagine that a carrier ( with infinite capacity ) begins from the left going from box to box .",
    "at each box , the carrier :      it is easy to see that this carrier description gives the same outcome as the time evolution described previously .",
    "let us rewrite the interaction of the carrier with a site in terms of coordinates .",
    "a site with @xmath142 extra capacity and @xmath143 balls will be denoted @xmath292 ; thus the empty box is denoted @xmath293 , and the box with a ball in it is denoted @xmath294 .",
    "the carrier will be denoted @xmath295 if it has @xmath296 balls in it .",
    "so when the carrier begins from the left , it is in the state @xmath297",
    ". then the interaction of the carrier and the box can be written as @xmath298 the reader is invited to verify that this transformation is ( after some relabeling ) the tropicalization of the birational @xmath299-action for @xmath69 : @xmath300        if we imagine that the system has @xmath15 boxes , then the invariants `` total number of balls '' and `` total amount of free space '' are equal to the tropicalizations of @xmath301 and @xmath302 . because of the curious way the box - ball coordinates are shifted with respect to the @xmath0-variables , the invariant @xmath182 can be given the following interpretation .",
    "its tropicalization is equal to 1 if every odd site is empty and every even site is occupied , and equal to 0 otherwise .",
    "each time evolution , the notions of odd and even swap ( pushing the carrier through shifts the parity )",
    ". it would be interesting to give similar interpretations for a general loop ( skew ) schur function .",
    "there is a vast literature generalizing box - ball systems to situations with many different kinds of balls ( corresponding to our @xmath303 ) , or to situations where boxes have higher capacity .",
    "see @xcite for some directions .",
    "[ rem : bbbs ] together with pylyavskyy and sakamoto , we give in @xcite a generalization of the box - ball system which arises from considering mixed directional horizontal wire on a cylinder , as in section [ sec : net ] .",
    "this new solitonic system involves , boxes , balls , and baskets .",
    "( baskets can contain balls , but they are allowed to move as well . )"
