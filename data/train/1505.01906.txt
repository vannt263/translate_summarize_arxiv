    "<S> a generalized trial wave function termed as the `` multi-@xmath0 ansatz '' has been developed to study the ground state of the spin - boson model with simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal coupling in the sub - ohmic regime . </S>",
    "<S> ground state properties including the energy and the spin polarization are investigated , and the results are consistent with those from the exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group approaches for the cases involving two oscillators and two baths described by a continuous spectral density function . </S>",
    "<S> breakdown of the rotational and parity symmetries along the continuous quantum phase transition separating the localized phase from the critical phase has been uncovered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the phase boundary is determined accurately with the corresponding symmetry parameters of the rotational and parity symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> a critical value of the spectral exponent @xmath1 is predicted in the weak coupling limit , which is in agreement with the mean - field prediction of @xmath2 , but much smaller than the earlier literature estimate of @xmath3 . </S>"
