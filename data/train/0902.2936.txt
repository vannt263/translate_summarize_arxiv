    "over the last two decades it has become apparent that many complex systems exhibit a phenomenom which has been termed anomalous diffusion @xcite . on account of this , there has been an increasing interest in stochastic processes deviating basically from standard diffusion processes characterized by a gaussian behavior .",
    "systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion differ from the linear time dependence of the second moment and rather show @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . in this context",
    "processes with @xmath2 dispersing faster than standard diffusion processes are called superdiffusive while @xmath3 means that a system displays subdiffusive behavior .    in the realm of anomalous diffusion ,",
    "the classical diffusion equation has to be replaced by the so - called generalized diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "the most prominent representatives of this class of equations are probably the fractional diffusion equations @xcite , where the derivatives with respect to time or to space or both are replaced by non - integer order derivatives .",
    "a more fundamental account to anomalous diffusion is provided by a stochastic process called continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) .",
    "this process generalizes the standard random walk and allows for random jump length and random waiting periods between the jumps @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the generalized diffusion equation can be derived from the governing equations of the ctrw .",
    "another approach to anomalous diffusion has been put forward by fogedby who proposed a coupled system of langevin equations leading to the generalized diffusion equations @xcite . in a sense , this approach can be considered as a continuous realization of the ctrw .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the effect of external forces onto processes exhibiting anomalous diffusion .",
    "although the incorporation of external forces is straightforward in classical diffusion theory , leading to the well - known fokker - planck equations , this task appears to be rather involved when anomalous diffusion is considered .",
    "the arising difficulties are due to the long jumps and the long waiting times that can occur . throughout this paper",
    "we distinguish between _ biasing _ and _ decoupled _ external forces .",
    "this notation shall indicate that there are two different possibilities of the action of the force .",
    "when we speak of a biasing field , we mean that the external field acts as a bias only at the time of the actual jump .",
    "in contrast to this we speak of a decoupled field if the diffusing particle is affected permanently during the waiting time periods and hence the diffusion process is decoupled from the effect of the field .",
    "note that this distinction is not necessary for classical diffusion processes .",
    "while the inclusion of external potentials is relatively well understood on the level of the generalized diffusion equations and the generalized fokker - planck equations respectively , there are still some open questions as long as the corresponding langevin equations are considered . however , an exhaustive comprehension of the langevin equations is inevitable to investigate the properties of sample paths of such processes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to clarify the different possibilities of including an external force into the framework of anomalous diffusion , namely the difference between biasing and decoupled external forces , by considering the corresponding langevin equations .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "first we state some fundamentals concerning the theory of anomalous diffusion and thereby shortly review fogedby s continuous formulation of ctrws and the concept of subordination .",
    "after shortly reviewing some wellknown and some very recent results on the langevin formulations of the generalized fokker - planck equations for biasing external fields we establish the langevin equations for generalized fokker - planck equations for decoupled external potentials which have not been considered so far .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on the role of external forces in anomalous diffusion .",
    "a suited stochastic process to describe discrete sample realizations of many microscopic processes leading to anomalous diffusion is provided by the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) .",
    "this process is an extension of the standard random walk and allows for random waiting times between jumps of random length . in the decoupled case",
    "the ctrw is characterized by a waiting time distribution @xmath4 and a jump length distribution @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the properties of these distributions , the ctrw can lead to an anomalous behavior of the mean - squared - displacement @xcite .",
    "the governing equation for the probability distribution ( pdf ) of the position of the walker is the montroll - shlesinger master equation @xcite @xmath6 where the time kernel @xmath7 is related to the waiting time distribution @xcite .",
    "the master equation ( [ montshle ] ) has a straightforward interpretation .",
    "it states that the density of particles at position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 is increased by particles that have been at @xmath10 at time @xmath11 and perform a jump from @xmath10 to @xmath8 at time @xmath9 . on the other hand the density",
    "is decreased by particles that have been at @xmath8 and jump away at time @xmath9 to some other position .",
    "the resulting process is non - markovian for waiting time distributions with a power - law tail .",
    "another account to describe the evolution of pdfs in the context of anomalous diffusion are the generalized diffusion or fractional diffusion equations .    for a subdiffusive process",
    "the generalized diffusion equation can be cast into the form @xmath12 for the special choice @xmath13 , which corresponds to mittag - leffler type waiting time distributions @xmath14 , eq.([gendiffeq ] ) yields the ( time- ) fractional diffusion equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the riemann - liouville fractional derivative .",
    "it is well - known that generalized diffusion equations can be derived from the montroll - shlesinger equation , see e.g. @xcite . in order to describe superdiffusive",
    "diffusion processes the so - called space - fractional diffusion equations have to be taken into account .",
    "these equations describe markovian processes with power - law distributed jump - length and are often referred to as lvy flights .",
    "a continuous realization of the ctrw has been considered by fogedby in @xcite .",
    "his formulation is based on a system of coupled langevin equations for the position @xmath8 and time @xmath9 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are random noise sources which are assumed to be independent .",
    "@xmath19 has in this context to be positive due to causality .",
    "the system ( [ fogedbysys ] ) can be interpreted as a standard langevin equation in a internal time @xmath20 that is subjected to a random time change .",
    "this random time change to the physical time @xmath9 is described by the second equation .",
    "the combined process in physical time is then given according to @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the inverse process to @xmath23 defined as @xmath24    closely related to this concept of fogedby is the mathematical method of _ subordination_. using the ( not to formal ) notation of fogedby one calls the process @xmath25 a parent process and @xmath20 its operational time .",
    "the random time - transformation function @xmath23 has to be a non - decreasing right - continuous function with an inverse function @xmath22 . the resulting process in physical time @xmath9",
    "is then obtained by @xmath21 $ ] and is referred to as subordinated to the parent process .",
    "consequently are the processes @xmath23 and @xmath22 named subordinator and inverse subordinator respectively .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the langevin equations ( [ fogedbysys ] ) lead to a time - fractional diffusion equation if the @xmath26 are governed by a generic one - sided @xmath27-stable distribution .",
    "generally the pdf of the subordinated process can be stated in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pdf of the inverse subordinator and @xmath30 is the solution of the parent process @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper we will restrict to anomalous diffusion processes governed by waiting time distributions , i.e. we will consider equations of the form ( [ gendiffeq ] ) .",
    "hence we consider processes which are e.g. ruled by lvy - stable subordinators and time - fractional equations .",
    "the role of external potentials for lvy flights is discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us first clarify what we mean by _ biasing _ external forces .",
    "therefore , consider the generic scenario of a subdiffusive ctrw governed by power - law distributed waiting times .",
    "a biasing external potential or force shall not affect the diffusing particle during the waiting periods but only provide it with a _ bias _ at the instance of a jump . in a sense",
    "one might say that the action of the force can be regarded as anomalous as well .",
    "if the considered force is time - independent it is well - known that anomalous diffusion in biasing fields can be described by the generalized fokker - planck equation @xmath31f(x , t')\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the external force @xcite .",
    "the equivalent description based on langevin equations is provided by the coupled system @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a gaussian and @xmath26 is a fully skewed @xmath27-stable lvy noise source @xcite .     for mittag - leffler type waiting time distributions with @xmath35 for the consecutive times @xmath36 to 5 .",
    "one can observe the persistence of the maximum at the origin indicating that there is no internal dynamic between the waiting times .",
    "the external biasing force acts only at the time of the displacements resulting in a asymmetry of the pdf .",
    "the plume stretches more and more into the direction of the force . ]",
    "if a time - dependent external force @xmath37 is considered it turns out that the situation is by far more involved .",
    "there exist different alternatives to include the force .",
    "one can for example consider the generalized fokker - planck equation @xmath38f(x , t')\\ , .\\ ] ] however , such a generalized fokker - planck equation turns out to be physically meaningless .",
    "the correct equation has been found recently @xcite @xmath39\\int_0^tdt'\\phi(t - t')f(x , t')\\ , .\\ ] ] recall that for the fractional time - kernel @xmath40 , eq.([timedep ] ) yields the fractional fokker - planck equation @xmath41\\mathcal{d}_t^{1-\\alpha}f(x , t)\\ , .\\ ] ] notice that the difficulty of time - dependent external forces stems from the fact that in this case the fractional derivative and the fokker - planck drift - term do not commute anymore . on the basis of the generalized fokker - planck equation , the difficulty is due the fact that it is not clear whether the external force has to depend on @xmath11 or @xmath9 . for a detailed treatment of this issue",
    ", we refer the reader to the original papers . at this point , we want to confine ourselves to a simple plausibility argument to account for the correct operator ordering which naturally does not replace a rigorous derivation .",
    "as we have already mentioned , when time - dependent transition amplitudes @xmath42 are considered , the question arises whether this amplitude has to depend on @xmath11 or @xmath9 which is equivalent to operator ordering problem in eq.([timedep ] ) . to answer this question ,",
    "let us consider the corresponding ctrw governed by the montroll - shlesinger equation ( [ montshle ] ) . according to the interpretation of this equation the probability to be at the position @xmath8 at time @xmath9",
    "is increased by the particles that jump at time @xmath9 from some @xmath10 to @xmath8 . since this jump which occurs at time @xmath9",
    "is governed by the transition amplitude @xmath43 it is clear that the transition amplitude has to depend on the time of the jump , i.e. @xmath44 . performing the appropriate limit procedure , one obtains eq.([timedep ] ) as the correct ffpe for time - dependent fokker - planck operators .",
    "consequently , the corresponding langevin equation for a time - dependent forcing is not straight - forward to derive .",
    "in fact , it has even been stated in @xcite that it is impossible to find a subordination description for time - dependent external fields .",
    "if the force is assumed to depend on the internal time , i.e. @xmath45 which corresponds to a completely subordinated force , the corresponding generalized fokker - planck equation would be eq.([ffpewrong ] ) and thus eq.([wronglangevin ] ) lacks a physical interpretation .",
    "the appropriate langevin system has been found recently by magdziarz and co - workers @xcite .",
    "they argued that a deterministic force should not be modified by the subordination procedure and depend on the physical time @xmath9 and proposed the langevin equations @xmath46 one recognizes that the force depends on the subordination process .",
    "subordination of the process @xmath25 then yields for the force term @xmath47)]=f(t)$ ] since @xmath48)=t$ ] and hence the desired dependence on the physical time .",
    "it has been proven in @xcite that the langevin equations ( [ klaftersys ] ) yields the same probability distributions as eq.([timedep ] ) and hence that they describe the same process .",
    "if a particle is assumed to be affected by an external potential throughout the whole waiting time period and the anomalous diffusion process is independent of this potential , we speak of a decoupled potential .",
    "it is instructive to consider a simple example where a particle which is advected by a constant force during the waiting periods and performs jumps after the waiting periods .",
    "the pdf of such a process has been proven to be governed by @xmath49f(x , t)= \\int_0^t dt ' \\phi(t - t ' ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}f(x - v(t - t ' ) , t')\\ , , \\ ] ] which can be considered as a generalized advection - diffusion equation , where the advection is normal while the diffusion is anomalous @xcite .",
    "observe the retardation of the pdf on the right - hand side which renders the equation non - local in space .",
    "a solution of this equation can be found after passing into a co - moving reference frame .",
    "the ansatz @xmath50 with the shifted variable @xmath51 yields a generalized diffusion equation for @xmath52 @xmath53 whose solution is given by ( see eq.([subsol ] ) ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the solution of the standard diffusion equation .",
    ", i.e. eq.([advec ] ) with a fractional time - kernel .",
    "one can see that this evolution can be regarded as a force - free anomalous diffusion in a co - moving reference frame .",
    "note that the force does not affect the diffusion process and hence can be considered as decoupled . ]    in order to establish the corresponding set of langevin equations , we have to be aware of the decoupled character of the advective field .",
    "that means , the advection has to be completely independent of the internal time @xmath20 .",
    "let us consider the following set of langevin equations @xmath56 the solution of the subordinated process @xmath57 $ ] can be found by integration @xmath58=\\int_0^{s(t)}v\\ , \\eta(s ' ) d[s'(t')]+b[s(t)]\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 $ ] means subordinated brownian motion , that is the force - free pure subdiffusive part of the process @xcite .",
    "the integral can be rewritten as @xmath60&=&\\int_0^{s(t)}v\\ , \\frac{dt'}{ds ' } d[s'(t ' ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_0^{t}v\\,dt ' = v t   \\nonumber\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yielding for the subordinated process @xmath61 \\ , .\\ ] ] introducing the variable @xmath62 again , this equation can be written as @xmath63 \\ , .\\ ] ] thus the variable @xmath52 performs a force - free subdiffusive process and therefore yields the probability distributions given by eq.([gendiffsol ] ) , which proves that the langevin equations ( [ adveclangevin ] ) actually corresponds to the generalized fokker - planck equation ( [ advec ] ) .    the case of time - dependent external field",
    "is only slightly more difficult .",
    "consider a process , where the particle ( of unit mass ) performs during the waiting periods an overdamped motion according to the equation of motion @xmath64 where @xmath37 is some time - dependent force - field .",
    "the corresponding generalized fokker - planck equation reads @xcite @xmath65f(x ,",
    "t)= \\int_0^t dt ' \\phi(t - t ' ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2 } e^{-\\int_{t'}^t f(t '' ) dt '' \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}}f(x , t')\\ , .\\ ] ] the exponential function on the right - hand - side is the so - called frobenius - perron operator of the equation of motion for the deterministic part of @xmath66 .",
    "this operator ensures the proper retardation of the probability distribution during the waiting period @xcite .    since eq.([eom ] ) describes an invertible conservative system eq.([advectime ] ) can be expressed as ( see @xcite ) @xmath67f(x , t)= \\int_0^t dt ' \\phi(t - t ' ) \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}f(x-\\int_{t'}^tf(t'')dt '' , t')\\ , .\\ ] ] performing the ansatz @xmath50 with @xmath68 , the pdf of @xmath52 is governed by the generalized diffusion equation ( [ gendiffxi ] ) .",
    "the corresponding langevin equation reads @xmath69 integration of this equation yields for the subordinated process @xmath70&=&\\int_0^{s(t)}f(s')\\ , \\eta(s ' ) d[s'(t')]+b[s(t ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_0^t f(t ' ) dt ' + b[s(t ) ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evidently @xmath68 performs for this case a force - free subdiffusive process which proves that @xmath66 is a solution of eq.([advectimeretard ] ) .",
    "note , however , at this point , that the inclusion of space - dependent forces is only straightforward as long as conservative dynamics is considered because only in that case the frobenius - perron operator can be expressed by a substitution operator like in eq.([advectimeretard ] ) .",
    "even the simple case of a linearly damped motion between the random kicks , i.e. @xmath71 leads to a generalized fokker - planck equation whose solution can not be expressed in a closed form @xcite .",
    "hence the prove used here is not applicable anymore .",
    "similarly , a closed form solution of the langevin equation can not be stated for this case .    comparing the langevin equation for a biasing time - dependent force eq.([klaftersys ] ) and the langevin equation for the decoupled case",
    ", one realizes the difference between these equations . for the case of a biasing force",
    ", the force has to depend on the subordination process in the parent process",
    ". then the force term yields the contribution @xmath72 to the process .",
    "observe that the force depends indeed on the physical time @xmath9 but is integrated over the subordinated measure .",
    "in the decoupled case however , the force is integrated in physical time and thus is completely independent of the diffusion process .",
    "of course it is possible to state the langevin equation for a process where a biasing and decoupled force are acting independently .",
    "if @xmath73 denotes the biasing and @xmath74 the decoupled force the corresponding langevin equation reads @xmath75 the time evolution of the pdf of such a process is displayed in fig .",
    "[ advecfokker ] for a constant biasing force and a constant decoupled force with same amplitude but opposite sign .",
    "note , however , that in many settings the two contributions are not independent and thus can display dependences .",
    "concluding , in this paper we have discussed the effect of external forces on anomalous diffusion processes on basis of their corresponding langevin equations .",
    "we have introduced the concept of a biasing and a decoupled external field which has no classical analoge .",
    "corresponding to the recently established langevin formulation of biased diffusion in a time - dependent external field @xcite , we have rigorously derived the langevin equations for decoupled forces . to clarify the concept of biasing an decoupled external force in systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion",
    "we have presented the time evolution of probability densities for the different considered cases .",
    "we have shown that the established langevin equation for decoupled force fields can be solved exactly for conservative space - independent dynamics .",
    "the presented work has aimed at a clarification of the role of external forces in complex systems which are characterized by subdiffusion and long waiting times respectively .",
    "the approach based on the langevin equation has provided thereby deep insight into the physical nature of the processes .",
    "concluding we shall exemplify the concept by two simple applications each with a constant force .",
    "first consider the diffusion of tracer particles in an advective flow which has frequent obstacles such as e.g. sediments .",
    "in this case the external force , i.e. the advective flow , is decoupled from the diffusion process .",
    "second , if the diffusion of groundwater through porous media is examined the gravity field provides a bias on the anomalous diffusion process .",
