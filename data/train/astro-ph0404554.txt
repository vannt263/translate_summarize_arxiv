    "pulsars are unique objects , with which all types of elemental interaction could be tested extremely . however , the most elementary question relevant is still open : _ what is the nature of pulsars ? _ it is conventionally thought that pulsars are simply a kind of boring big `` nuclei ''  neutron stars , but more and more attention is paid to the quark star model for pulsars @xcite since _ no _ convincing work , neither in theory from first principles nor in observation , has confirmed baade - zwicky s original idea that supernovae produce neutron stars . the bare quark surface is suggested to be a new probe for identifying quark stars with strangeness , and possible observational evidence for bare strange stars appears : the drifting subpulses of radio pulsars , ultra - high luminosity of soft @xmath3-ray repeaters , non - atomic thermal spectra of isolated `` neutron '' stars @xcite . however , can the bare strange star model reproduce most of the general features of pulsars ( especially glitches ) ?",
    "the observation of free precession in psr b1828 - 11 @xcite and psr b1642 - 03 @xcite challenges astrophysicists today to re - consider the internal structure of radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "the current model for glitches involves neutron superfluid vertex pinning and the consequent fluid dynamics",
    ". however , the pinning should be much weaker than predicted in the glitch models , otherwise the vortex pinning will damp out the precession on timescales being much smaller than observed .",
    "in addition the picture , that a neutron star core containing coexisting neutron vertices and proton flux tubes , is also inconsistent with observations of freely precessing pulsars @xcite .",
    "it is then supposed that the hydrodynamic forces presented in a precessing star are probably sufficient to unpin all of the vortices of the inner crust @xcite since a definitive conclusion on the nature of vertex pinning has not been reached yet due to various uncertainties in the microscopic physics .",
    "but recently , levin & dangelo @xcite studied the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) coupling between the crust and the core of a rotating neutron star , and found that the precession of psr b1828 - 11 should decay over a human lifetime .",
    "this well - defined mhd dissipation should certainly be important in order to test the stellar models .    an alternative way to understand both glitch and free - precession could be through the suggestion that radio pulsars are solid quark stars @xcite .",
    "a solid quark star is just a rigid - like body , no damping occurs , and the solid pulsar model may survive future observational tests if the free precession keeps the same over several tens of years . a neutron star could not be in a solid state , whereas a cold quark star could be",
    ". such a solid state of quark matter could be very probably skyrme - likequark clusters might also be described as solitons in a similar way . ]",
    "@xcite , the study of which may help us to understand dense quark matter with low temperature .",
    "fluid strange - star ( even with possible crusts ) models were noted to be inconsistent with the observations of pulsar glitches more than one decade ago @xcite . modifications with the inclusion of possible stable particles to form a differentiated structure of so - called strange pulsars was also suggested @xcite , but is not popular because of a disbelief in the employed physics @xcite .",
    "however , can a fully solidified quark star proposed @xcite really reproduce the glitch behaviors observed ?",
    "one negative issue is that giant glitches are generally not able to occur at an observed rate in a solid neutron star @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , more strain energy could be stored in a solid quark star due to an almost uniform distribution of density ( the density near the surface of a bare strange star is @xmath4 g/@xmath1 ) and high shear modulus introduced phenomenologically for solid quark matter with strangeness .",
    "more energy is then released , and this may enable a solid pulsar to glitch frequently with large amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , the post - glitch behaviors may represent damped vibrations . in this paper",
    ", we try to model glitches in a starquake scenario of solid quark stars .",
    "a quake model for a star to be mostly solid was generally discussed by baym & pines @xcite and others @xcite , who parameterized the dynamics for solid crusts , and possible solid cores , of neutron stars .",
    "strain energy develops when a solid star spins down until a quake occurs when stellar stresses reach a critical value .",
    "two possibilities were considered previously .",
    "ruderman @xcite assumed that the entire strain energy is relieved in the quake , while baym & pines @xcite suggested only part of the stress is released and that the plastic flow is negligible . we present a third possibility that , during a quake , the entire stress is almost relieved at first when the quake cracks the star in pieces of small size ( the total released energy @xmath5 may be converted into thermal energy @xmath6 and kinematic energy @xmath7 of plastic flow , @xmath8 , but the part of @xmath7 might be re - stored by stress due to the anelastic flow ( i.e.",
    ", the kinetic energy is converted to strain energy again ) .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , a quark star may solidify with an initial oblateness @xmath9 ; stress ( to be relative to @xmath9 ) increases as the star losses its rotation energy , until the star reaches an oblateness @xmath10 .",
    "a quake occurs then , and the reference point of strain energy should be changed to @xmath11 ( the oblateness of a star without shear energy ) at this moment .",
    "damped vibrations in the potential field ( see the inserted up - right part of fig.1 ) occur therefore .",
    "after a glitch , the star solidifies and becomes elastic body again .    .",
    "the horizontal solid lines are for the reference points of the strain .",
    "the steps , drawn very exaggeratedly , are starquakes .",
    "no starquake occurs anymore when @xmath12 falls below @xmath13 ( i.e. , the stress can not be large enough for a quake ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    no memory of the first glitch affects the second one .",
    "the density of quark stars with mass @xmath14 can be well approximated to be uniform @xcite . as a star , with an initial value @xmath15 , slows down , the expected @xmath12 decreases with increasing period .",
    "however , the rigidity of the solid star causes it to remain more oblate than it would be had it no resistance to shear .",
    "the strain energy in the star reads @xcite @xmath16 and the mean stress @xmath17 in the star is @xmath18 where @xmath12 is stellar oblateness is defined by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the semimajor and semiminor axes , respectively ) . the oblateness ( or ellipticity ) @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the nonrotating , spherical moment of inertia ) is related to @xmath24 through @xmath25 . ] , @xmath26 is the volume of the star , and @xmath27 is the mean shear modulus of the star .",
    "we note that , in the following calculations , the stress - increase developed by the decrease of oblateness ( due to the spindown ) is only included . however , azimuthal stress due to the general relativistic effect @xcite ( maybe similar to the frame - dragging effect in vacuum ) of rotating solid stars may contribute significantly , though , unfortunately , the theoretical answers to elastic relativistic - stars with rotation are very difficult to be worked out .    the total energy of such a rotating star with mass @xmath28 and radius @xmath29 is the sum of the gravitational energy @xmath30 , the rotation energy @xmath31 , the strain energy @xmath32 , the bulk energy @xmath33 , and the surface energy @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the reference oblateness before the @xmath37-th glitch occurs , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the moment of inertia , @xmath40 is the stellar angular momentum , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 the rotation period ) , and the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 measure the gravitational and strain energies @xcite , respectively , @xmath45 @xmath46 the changes of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are much smaller than that of @xmath30 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48 when a star spins down , according to a mass formula for strange quark matter to be analogous to the bethe - weizsacher semi - empirical mass function @xcite .",
    "we therefore neglect @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the following calculations .    by minimizing the total energy @xmath49 , a real state satisfies ( note that @xmath50 ) , @xmath51",
    "the reference oblateness is assumed , by setting @xmath52 in eq.([epsilon ] ) , to be @xmath53 a star with oblateness of eq.([epsiloni ] ) is actually a maclaurin sphere .",
    "when the star spins down to @xmath54 , the stress develops to @xmath55,% \\label{sigmamu}\\ ] ] according to eq.([sigma ] ) .",
    "a glitch takes place if the stress is greater than a critical one , @xmath56 .",
    "the first quake is characterized by a sudden shift of @xmath12 , the amount of which is @xmath57 where the reference point is changed from @xmath9 to @xmath11 . due to the conservation of stellar angular momentum , the sudden change in the oblateness results in an increase of spin frequency",
    ", @xmath58 starquakes would also produce a thermal energy dissipation during glitches that could be expected to be observable as an increase of x - ray luminosity soon after glitch . according to the conservation of energy , one obtains from eq.([e ] ) , @xmath59 where @xmath60 , which can be obtained by @xmath61 from eq.([sigmamu ] ) , is the spin frequency when the first quake occurs , @xmath62 is the released energy in a starquake .",
    "the observed glitch size @xmath63 can be calculated from eq.([epsilon ] ) to eq.([epsinon-1 ] ) .",
    "the calculations , based on these equations , are parameterized by five input quantities : @xmath28 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and two of them are fixed to be @xmath68 and @xmath69 g/@xmath1 .",
    "2 shows the results for various @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    ", vs. the rotation period , @xmath42",
    ". the lines labelled i , ii , and iii are for different shear modulus , @xmath65 .",
    "i : @xmath70 erg/@xmath71 , ii : @xmath72 erg/@xmath73 , and iii : @xmath74 erg/@xmath71 .",
    "the dash - dot , dotted , solid and dashed lines are for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 erg/@xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we observe that the curves tend towards the asymptotic line when @xmath79 erg/@xmath71 .",
    "the stellar mass and mean density are chosen to be mass @xmath68 and density @xmath69 g/@xmath1 in the calculations .",
    ", width=340 ]    we see that , for @xmath80 erg/@xmath71 , @xmath63 decays to be a constant for pulsars with large rotation periods .",
    "small @xmath65 may generally result also in a small jump of @xmath63 for a certain period @xmath42 .",
    "however , for @xmath81 erg/@xmath71 , the asymptotic line is reached , which means that @xmath82 .",
    "we choose @xmath83 erg/@xmath71 in computation , but the curves do not depend sensitively on @xmath84 .",
    "it is found that the glitch amplitude , @xmath63 , could be as high as observed if the shear modulus @xmath85 erg/@xmath1 .",
    "though the quark matter with low temperature and high baryon density is focused recent years , it is still impossible to determine the properties of such qcd phase by first principles ( most of the calculations are started from qcd phenomenological models ) .",
    "one of the proposed states of strange stars at low temperature could be a solid state @xcite ( and also the 2nd paragraph of  4 ) , but the calculations on solid state is much more difficult than that of fluid one .",
    "nevertheless , we may estimate the shear modulus @xmath65 originated only by electric interaction between charged @xmath86quark clusters ( @xmath87 : the quark number in a cluster ) and a uniform background of electrons , through a similar quantum mechanical calculation of metals @xcite .",
    "the effective shear modulus , averaged over polarizations and directions , can be well fitted by @xmath88 in asymptotic case , where @xmath89 is the charge of quark - clusters , @xmath90 the cluster number density and @xmath20 the separation between clusters @xcite .",
    "for strange quark matter with baryon number density @xmath91 and electron number density to be @xmath92 that of quarks , one comes to @xmath93 where @xmath94 baryons per @xmath95 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "this result can be regarded as a low limit modulus of solid strange quark matter since the van der waals - type color interaction , with a high coupling constant ( to be corresponding to the electric charge @xmath24 in electromagnetic interaction ) , may result in a larger shear modulus .",
    "we might then conclude that @xmath65 in the range of @xmath96 erg/@xmath1 is not impossible .",
    "if the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations are relevant to the global oscillation behavior of solid quark stars , the shear modulus could be @xcite @xmath97 erg/@xmath1 , which is much larger than the value ( @xmath98 erg/@xmath1 ) of neutron star crust",
    ". this could be unsurprise due to much high density .",
    "after the first quake , from eq.([sigmamu ] ) , the stress in the star builds up again , at a rate of @xmath99 which is almost a constant for a certain pulsar with @xmath42 and @xmath100 during a period when the effect of @xmath101 is negligible .",
    "another quake occurs after a time of @xmath102 the calculation for certain @xmath42 and @xmath103 is presented in fig.3 .",
    "for a certain set of \\{@xmath104 } , the interval @xmath105 become longer for a higher value of @xmath66 .",
    "it is , however , not necessary to expect that a radio pulsar should jump its rotation periodically , because of no reason to show that the critical value @xmath66 ( and maybe @xmath65 ) keeps a constant during its life .",
    "the time separation @xmath106 may present a quasi - periodic nature if @xmath66 has a gaussian distribution .",
    "when @xmath107th quake occurs in a pulsar , the oblateness decreases to @xmath108 at first , while the reference point is changed to @xmath36 from @xmath109 .",
    "soon after the rotational jump ( @xmath110 ) , the star has a tendency to reach the equilibrium oblateness @xmath36 .",
    "certainly , this recovery process depends on the difference , @xmath111 , which is shown in fig.4 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "increasing oblateness can obviously contribute an additional spindown role besides that of magnetodipole radiation , which results in larger @xmath103 .",
    "such a post - starquake could be observed as a recover behavior during post - glitch . from fig.4",
    ", one can see the values of @xmath111 are generally not sensitive to both @xmath6 and @xmath66 .     as a function of @xmath112 .",
    "the lines are grouped for different periods ; `` i '' : @xmath113 s , `` ii '' : @xmath114 s , and `` iii '' : @xmath115 s. the solid and dashed lines are for @xmath75 and @xmath77 erg/@xmath71 , respectively , which are almost the same for certain period @xmath42 .",
    "other parameters chosen are : @xmath68 , @xmath69 g/@xmath1 , and @xmath72 erg/@xmath71 .",
    ", width=340 ]    the recovery of @xmath116 is actually a complex process , in which both elastic revert and plastic flow could not be negligible .",
    "nevertheless , this recovery process might be an analog of damped oscillations , with a mathematical description of @xmath117 with @xmath118 . the second term in eq.([ddotepsinon ] )",
    "arise from the anelastic effect during the recovery .",
    "the solution of eq.([ddotepsinon ] ) depends on the relative strength of the elastic spring and that of the damping .",
    "it is well known that three possible solutions exist ; the so - called underdamped case : @xmath119 , the critical case : @xmath120 , and the overdamped case : @xmath121 ; where @xmath122 is the intrinsic frequency .",
    "one comes then to @xmath123 by dimensional analysis ( force @xmath124 and displacement @xmath125 ) .    in all the three cases , the oscillation damps by a factor of @xmath126 , with a typical time of @xmath127 .",
    "we are just to discuss the critical damped motion below for an indication . in this case ,",
    "@xmath128 , the time evolution of @xmath12 after the occurrence of starquake can be solved by eq.([ddotepsinon ] ) , @xmath129",
    "a starquake model for pulsar glitches is developed in the regime of solid quark stars , and it is found that the general glitch behaviors ( i.e. , the glitch amplitude @xmath63 and the time interval @xmath106 ) could be reproduced if solid quark matter has properties of shear modulus @xmath130 erg/@xmath1 and critical stress @xmath131 erg/@xmath1 . it is suggested that the post - glitch process could be described as damped oscillations , especially in the critical and the overdamped cases .",
    "anyway , this is only a primary and simplified study of quakes in solid quark stars , more elaborate work , with possible modifications , on both quake and postquake processes is necessary in order to understand the nature of solid quark matter through glitching pulsars .",
    "we are dealing with solid quark stars in this paper .",
    "the quark cooper pairing of the bcs type is suggested in quark matter of low - temperature but high baryon density , which may result in a color superconducting state @xcite , with a large pairing gap on the order of 100 mev .",
    "this kind of condensation in momentum space takes place in case of same fermi momenta ; whereas `` loff''-like state may occur if the fermi momenta of two ( or more ) species of quarks are different @xcite . for 3 flavors of massless quarks , all nine quarks pair in a pattern which locks color and flavor symmetries , as called color - flavor locking ( cfl ) state @xcite",
    "however , for such quark matter , there exists a _ competition _ between color superconductivity and solidification , just like the case of laboratory low - temperature physics .",
    "one needs weak - interaction and low - mass in order to obtain a quantum fluid before solidification .",
    "this is why only helium , of all the elements , shows superfluid phenomenon though other noble elements have similar weak strength of interaction due to filled crusts of electrons .",
    "the strong color interaction ( and the coulomb interaction in the system with strangeness ) may be responsible for a possible solidification of dense quark matter with low temperatures .",
    "further experiments ( in low - energy heavy ion colliders ) may answer whether quark matter is in a state of solid or color - superconductivity .",
    "can a solid neutron star be possible ?",
    "the answer might be _ no _ , because at least the part of neutron matter with approximate nuclear saturation density should be in a fluid state . in this sense , only solid quark matter is possible , and a quark star is identified if one convinces that a pulsar is in a solid state .",
    "we have assumed that the entire strain energy @xmath48 is relieved in a quake , which results in the reference oblateness of eq.([epsiloni ] ) .",
    "however , it is possible that not entire , but most of , the energy @xmath48 is released in a real situation , and the actual reference points are near but larger than @xmath36 . of course , there is a tendency of @xmath132 after the @xmath107th quake , but the effective shear modulus , @xmath133 , of matter broken could be much smaller than that of perfect elastic solid , @xmath65 .",
    "the recovery timescale could be @xmath134 days if @xmath135 is order of @xmath136 erg/@xmath1 .",
    "a large vela glitch on 2000 january 16.319 was noted @xcite , and _",
    "observations were carried out @xmath137 and @xmath138 days after the glitch @xcite , but no temperature change expected in conventional models with released thermal energy of @xmath139 ergs is detected .",
    "this could be understood in this starquake model since ( 1 ) the thermal conductivity of quark matter is much larger than that of hadron matter and ( 2 ) the thermal energy released , @xmath84 , to be much smaller than @xmath140 ergs is possible .",
