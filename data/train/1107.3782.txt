    "the term `` @xmath34 physics '' stands for the study of the reaction of order @xmath35 @xmath36 , where @xmath1 is some arbitrary final state allowed by conservation laws . in particular , hadronic states with @xmath37 are directly produced through the @xmath38 subprocess . for quasi - real photons",
    "the number of produced events can be estimated from the expression @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath5 luminosity , @xmath41 the photon - photon center of mass energy ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 the photon - photon flux and @xmath44 the cross section into a given final state . by neglecting single powers of @xmath45 , when the scattered leptons are undetected in the final state one",
    "has @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( low function )  @xcite given by @xmath48 the @xmath34 processes studied with kloe are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "past experiments measuring the @xmath34 cross section for light mesons production , took data at a center of mass energy @xmath51 gev . a low energy @xmath5 factory , such as da@xmath4ne , compensates the small cross section value with the high luminosity .",
    "da@xmath4ne is an @xmath5 collider designed to operate at the center of mass energy @xmath52 gev , namely the @xmath7 meson mass .",
    "the sample used for the present analyses consists of data taken at @xmath53 gev , which allows the reduction of the background from @xmath7 decays , with an integrated luminosity of 240 pb@xmath8 .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large ( 3.3  m length and 2  m radius ) volume drift chamber , surrounded by a lead  scintillating fibers calorimeter .",
    "the detector is inserted in a superconducting coil producing an axial field @xmath54=0.52",
    "t. charged particle momenta are reconstructed with resolution @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) for large ( small ) angle tracks .",
    "calorimeter energy clusters are reconstructed with energy and time resolution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ps .",
    "data are processed with a dedicated filter asking for at least two prompt photons , clusters not associated to tracks and propagating with @xmath59 , with energy @xmath60 mev and polar angle @xmath61 , the most energetic with @xmath62 mev , the fraction of energy carried by photons @xmath63 and the total energy in the calorimeter @xmath64 mev .",
    "the latter requirement rejects low energy background and the high rate processes @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the selection of these events asks for two photons compatible with a @xmath67 decay and two tracks with opposite curvature coming from the collision point .",
    "the charged pion mass is assigned to the two tracks and a least squares function based on lagrange multipliers imposes that @xmath68 come from an @xmath2 decay . therefore most background events are suppressed , except for the irreducible process @xmath69 , with the monochromatic photon , @xmath70 = 350 mev , lost in the beam pipe . for these background events ,",
    "however , the correlation between the squared missing mass , @xmath71 , and the longitudinal momentum , @xmath72 , of the @xmath68 system is rather different than for the signal .",
    "further criteria are applied to suppress processes with photons and @xmath5 in the final state .",
    "the monte carlo , mc , generator used for the signal  @xcite allows the full phase space generation of @xmath73 events .",
    "[ f : mpipiggpi+pi - pi0 ] ( left ) shows the @xmath71 distribution for data fitted with the superposition of mc shapes for signal and background .",
    "an independent fit is performed with the @xmath68 longitudinal momentum .",
    "both fits show the same yields for the background processes and more than 600 signal events .",
    "the cross section of the irreducible process @xmath69 is evaluated using the same sample of data and asking for three photons in the final state .",
    "a kinematic fit is performed , requiring energy and momentum conservation , and the improved variables are used to fit in the distribution of the recoil photon energy ( fig .",
    "[ f : mpipiggpi+pi - pi0 ] , right ) .",
    "the preliminary result is @xmath74 nb , where the systematic uncertainty is given by residual @xmath75 background .",
    "the cross section @xmath76 is under evaluation .",
    "the main backgrounds for this analysis are annihilation processes with at least four prompt photons in the final state , @xmath77 , for which accidental or split calorimeter clusters increase the photon multiplicity .",
    "events with six and only six prompt photons in the final state and with no tracks in the drift chamber are selected .",
    "the photons are paired choosing the combination which minimizes the @xmath78-like variable @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the invariant mass of each pair of photons and @xmath81 the resolution .",
    "then , a kinematic fit is performed asking for the six photons invariant mass to be equal to the mass of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "a cut is then applied on the energy of the most energetic photon , to reject @xmath82 events in which the monochromatic photon is detected .",
    "the squared missing mass , @xmath71 , distribution is well described by the @xmath83 and @xmath84 mc shapes .",
    "[ fig : eta ] , left , shows the fit in @xmath71 .    from the fit we obtain about 900 @xmath85 events and a preliminary value for the cross section , measured with the @xmath11 channel , @xmath86 , in agreement with that measured through the @xmath10 channel",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] ( right ) among other experimental results  @xcite as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "we are finalizing the evaluation of the @xmath88 cross section .",
    "the main goal of this analysis is to investigate the low @xmath3 invariant mass region , just above the production threshold , where a contribution from the @xmath89 scalar meson  @xcite as an intermediate state is expected .",
    "the main backgrounds are annihilation processes with four or more prompt photons in the final state : @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , due to the possibility of cluster splitting , the @xmath91 process is also considered as a source of background .",
    "selected events have no tracks in the drift chamber and four prompt photons in the final state with polar angle @xmath92 and energy @xmath93 . the photons are paired choosing the combination which minimizes the @xmath78-like variable of eq.([eq : chipair ] ) in the case of four photons coming from two neutral pions , @xmath94 .",
    "events with @xmath95 are rejected : the effect of this selection is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi0pi0 ] ( left ) . to reject @xmath96 events , where a large amount of non - prompt energy is released in the detector a tighter cut on the energy fraction carried by photons , @xmath97 , is applied .",
    "the four photon invariant mass spectrum for the selected data sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi0pi0 ] ( right ) together with the normalized background monte carlo simulations .",
    "the excess of events with respect to the expected annihilation processes , in the low invariant mass region , is an indication of the @xmath12 production .",
    "the determination of the differential cross section @xmath98 is in progress .",
    "from an integrated luminosity of 240 pb@xmath8 of data collected at da@xmath4ne , operating at @xmath6 gev , the following preliminary results in @xmath34 analyses are achieved :    * unambiguous signature of both @xmath9 and @xmath12 events , without any @xmath99 tagger ; * @xmath9 events are observed through both @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels , with independent systematics ; * from the same data sample , an exploratory research shows a structure at small values of the @xmath100 spectrum , where the process @xmath101 is expected .    as a by - product , we determined the cross section @xmath102 at @xmath53 gev , with accuracy better than the closer data points .",
    "these results are encouraging also in view of the forthcoming data taking campaign of the kloe-2 project  @xcite , when both low and high energy @xmath99 tagging devices will be available .",
    "we thank the dafne team for their efforts in maintaining low background running conditions and their collaboration during all data - taking . we want to thank our technical staff : g.  f.  fortugno and f.  sborzacchi for their dedication in ensuring efficient operation of the kloe computing facilities ; m.  anelli for his continuous attention to the gas system and detector safety ; a.  balla , m.  gatta , g.  corradi and g.  papalino for electronics maintenance ; m.  santoni , g.  paoluzzi and r.  rosellini for general detector support ; c.  piscitelli for his help during major maintenance periods .",
