    "much of the internal structure of the nucleon has been revealed during the last two decades through the _ inclusive _ scattering of high energy leptons on the nucleon in the bjorken -or  deep inelastic scattering  \" ( dis)- regime defined by @xmath1 and @xmath2 finite .",
    "simple theoretical interpretations of the experimental results can be reached in the framework of qcd , when one sums over all the possible hadronic final states . + with the advent of the new generation of high - energy , high - luminosity lepton accelerators combined with large acceptance spectrometers , a wide variety of _ exclusive _ processes in the bjorken regime are considered as experimentally accessible . in recent years",
    ", a unified theoretical description of such processes has emerged through the formalism introducing new generalized parton distributions , the so - called ` off - forward parton distributions ' ( ofpd s ) , commonly also denoted as skewed parton distributions .",
    "it has been shown that these distributions , which parametrize the structure of the nucleon , allow to describe , in leading order perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , various exclusive processes in the near forward direction .",
    "the most promising ones are deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and longitudinal electroproduction of vector or pseudoscalar mesons ( see refs.@xcite-@xcite and references therein to other existing literature ) .",
    "maybe most of the recent interest and activity in this field has been triggered by the observation of ji @xcite , who showed that the second moment of these ofpd s measures the contribution of the spin and orbital momentum of the quarks to the nucleon spin .",
    "clearly this may shed a new light on the `` spin - puzzle '' .",
    "+ in section [ sec : sec2 ] , we introduce the definitions and conventions of the skewed parton distributions .",
    "we also present the modelizations for these distributions that will be used in our cross section estimates . + in section",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] , the leading order pqcd amplitudes for dvcs and longitudinal electroproduction of mesons are presented in some detail .",
    "this is an extension of our previous works @xcite .",
    "+ in section [ sec : sec4 ] , we investigate the power corrections to the leading order amplitudes when the virtuality of the photon is in the region @xmath3 gev@xmath4 . the correction due to the intrinsic transverse momentum dependence",
    "is known to be important to get a successful description of the @xmath5 transition form factor , for which data exist in the range @xmath6 gev@xmath4 . for the pion electromagnetic form factor in the transition region before asymptotia is reached , the power corrections due to both the transverse momentum dependence and the soft overlap mechanism are quantitatively important .",
    "we will therefore take these form factors as a guide to calculate the corrections due to the parton s intrinsic transverse momentum dependence in the dvcs and hard meson electroproduction amplitudes .",
    "in addition , for the meson electroproduction amplitude , an estimate is given for the competing soft overlap mechanism , which - in contrast to the leading order perturbative mechanism - does not proceed through one - gluon exchange .",
    "+ in section [ sec : sec5 ] , we give numerical estimates for different observables for dvcs and for the electroproduction of vector mesons @xmath7 , @xmath8 and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",

    "our estimate for the overlap contribution indicates therefore that one is in a more favorable situation with longitudinal meson electroproduction compared with the pion electromagnetic ff case .",

    "the form factor is therefore comparable to the real part of the hard electroproduction amplitude .",
    "as the imaginary part of the hard electroproduction amplitude is numerically by far larger than its real part in the kinematics considered here , the competing ( real ) soft overlap mechanism might well dominate the real part of the amplitude at the lower @xmath0 , without dominating the predictions calculated with the total l.o .",
