    "fracture phenomena are quite common in nature and play a fundamental role in many situations of interest for science and technological applications @xcite . despite many advances in materials science and applied mechanics along the past decades",
    ", the full description of such problems remains a great challenge to physicists and engineers @xcite .",
    "however , it is a well - known fact that the presence of cracks within a material can magnify by several times the effect of the external stresses applied , causing a strong reduction in its strength and inducing rupture at a stress very much lower than that needed to break the atomic bonds in a flawless , regular arrangement @xcite .    scaling arguments developed by griffith @xcite",
    "show that a single crack , after reaching some critical length , will propagate spontaneously within the material , causing its catastrophic failure .",
    "below that critical length , many kinds of external mechanisms occurring on relatively slow time scales can dominate the crack dynamics , defining a subcritical regime of crack growth @xcite . among those mechanisms we highlight the occurrence of fatigue as the result of a progressive accumulation of damage throughout the material when submitted to cyclic load @xcite .    in general ,",
    "subcritical fatigue crack propagation is well described by an empirical law largely used in engineering practice , known as the paris ( or paris - erdogan ) law @xcite , which states that the growth rate of a linear crack under cyclic load follows a power law of the stress - intensity factor , with an exponent @xmath2 , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the crack half - length , @xmath13 is the number of loading cycles applied to the material , @xmath14 is the crack growth rate ( proportional to the crack tip speed ) , @xmath15 is the amplitude of the stress - intensity factor of the crack , @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the stress amplitude and a geometrical factor , respectively , while @xmath2 ( the paris exponent ) and @xmath18 are parameters which may depend on both the material properties and the experimental conditions .",
    "numerous experiments confirm the validity of this law over several orders of magnitude for a wide variety of materials and loading conditions @xcite .    despite its simplicity and practical importance ,",
    "a systematic understanding of this law on physical grounds is still lacking , especially as regards the determination of an explicit relation between the paris exponent @xmath2 and microscopic parameters of a given material .",
    "an intermediate step was taken by three of the authors of the present paper @xcite , who were able to show that the paris law indeed emerges from a damage - accumulation rule defined by a power law of the external stress amplitude , with a characteristic exponent @xmath0 , whose relation with the paris exponent @xmath2 can be determined via a combination of analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "although such a damage - accumulation rule can be justified by invoking self - similarity concepts @xcite , a first - principle calculation of the damage - accumulation exponent @xmath0 for a given material remains challenging .",
    "our aim in this paper is to further explore the consequences of the dynamics associated with a power - law damage accumulation rule , both in the uniform limit and in combination with disorder in the local rupture thresholds . regarding disorder",
    ", some progress has already been made in ref .",
    "@xcite by a mapping to a random - fuse problem , which was solved numerically .",
    "here we combine results from linear elastic fracture mechanics with an independent - crack approximation to perform a thorough study of the effects of disorder on the relation between the damage - accumulation exponent @xmath0 and the paris exponent @xmath2 .",
    "we also investigate the effects of introducing a healing mechanism which lowers the local damage throughout the material as time passes .",

    "the next sections deal with particular cases and extensions .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that a single thin elliptic crack is initially produced in an infinite two - dimensional sample of a linear elastic material .",
    "the sample is subject to cyclic loading , with an external stress @xmath19 transverse to the major axis of the crack .",
    "we further assume that the crack grows only along its major axis , so that crack propagation becomes essentially a one - dimensional problem , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    along the crack line",
    ", we discretize space so that the crack grows by the rupture of elements of fixed length @xmath24 , and assume that , when the crack has length @xmath25 , the element at position @xmath20 experiences a stress given by @xmath26 .",
    "this assumption prevents the appearance of divergences in the stress field around the crack tip and , to a first approximation , is consistent with the fact that linear elasticity theory must break down in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip , giving rise to a fracture process zone or plastic zone @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the relaxation time of the material is much shorter than the period of the loading cycle , so that crack propagation can be investigated within a quasistatic approximation , according to which the system always reaches its equilibrium state between two successive crack - growth events .    in the continuum limit , and within linear elasticity theory ,",
    "the local stress @xmath27 along the crack line is given by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath19 is the external stress applied to the material , @xmath20 is the coordinate of the point of interest , @xmath29 is the coordinate of the midpoint of the crack and @xmath25 is the crack length ( see fig .

    "[ fig3 ] for an illustration .",
    "therefore , the damage at position @xmath20 when the crack is about to grow from length @xmath25 is given by the relation @xmath41 in which @xmath42 is the previous crack length .",
    "when the crack always advances symmetrically with respect to the midpoint of the initial crack , we have @xmath43 .",
    "a heuristic motivation for the power - law dependence of the damage increment can be formulated by invoking concepts of self similarity and fractality commonly observed in spatial patterns related to crack propagation and fragmentation processes @xcite , and assuming that the most important contribution to damage accumulation comes from the local stress amplitude .",
    "finally , we assume that an element at position @xmath20 ruptures when the corresponding accumulated damage reaches a threshold @xmath44 . in the uniform limit , @xmath45 for all @xmath20 , elements break sequentially , starting from the initial crack tips , and the crack advances symmetrically . in the general case ,",
    "as shown below , elements far from the crack tip can suffer early rupture , leading to irregular crack growth and to the presence of multiple cracks . in all cases , we focus on the growth of the initial crack  or _ main _ crack  which may involve secondary cracks when these coalesce with the main crack .    the main crack advances when the accumulated damage in one or both elements at the crack tips reaches the corresponding threshold .",
    "equations ( [ damage ] ) and ( [ recurrence ] ) allow the calculation of the number of cycles since the last growth event and of the updated accumulated damage along the crack line .",
    "when all fatigue thresholds are equal , i.e. in the uniform limit , the monotonic behavior of the stress amplitude function @xmath39 ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) ensures the existence of a single crack along the whole rupture process .",
