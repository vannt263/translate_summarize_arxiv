    "in the course of spin deceleration a neutron star having a strong magnetic field may pass through an evolution stage of the propeller before accreting gas from the surroundings and appearing as a bright x - ray source ( schwartzman 1971 , illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "however , from observations propellers are not known reliably .",
    "the transfer from the propeller stage to accretion one is abrupt .",
    "such transfers are suggested only in the low mass x - ray binaries aqlx1 and saxj1808.4 - 3658 ( zhang , yu & zhang 1998 , stella et al .",
    "there are difficulties in recognition of stars at the propeller stage because of their faintness .",
    "stars - propellers escape apparent identification and may appear unusual .",
    "so , the whole class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) of nova - like type and particularly that of swsex type , having some anomalies , have been suggested by horne ( 1999 ) as stars with disk - anchored propellers .",
    "but the only reliable example of the propeller is fascinating aeaqr ( wynn , king & horne 1997 ) , where the rapidly spinning magnetic white dwarf ( wd ) operates as a propeller .",
    "possibly , propellers work in the striking symbiotic stars ( sss ) chcyg  and mwc560  too . the propeller in chcyg",
    "was suggested long ago ( mikoajewski & mikoajewska 1988 ) , but this is out of view of theorists until , in spite of scarcity of data on propellers .",
    "there are other sss similar in some respects to chcyg  and mwc560 .",
    "therefore a magnetic propeller may be an widespread phenomenon amongst sss .",
    "here we study the observation appearances of a propeller by the examples of chcyg  and mwc560 .    in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the observational properties of chcyg  and mwc560 in a framework of the magnetic propeller model , outlined in sect .  2 .",
    "the knowledge of observational signs of a propeller would allow it to be discriminated one amongst another object and we summarize them in sect .",
    "a magnetic propeller model has been discussed in details everywhere ( lipunov 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "we use one of the variants of the model .    let a wd of radius @xmath1 has a surface dipolar magnetic field @xmath2 and a rotation period @xmath3 .",
    "the gas captured gravitationally by the wd settles on the star magnetosphere . below the magnetosphere boundary the infalling gas is controlled by the magnetic field and corotates with the star .",
    "the gas accretes onto the surface of the star when the magnetosphere radius @xmath4 is smaller than the corotation radius , at which the keplerian velocity equals the velocity of corotation with the star , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the gravitation constant , @xmath7 mass of the wd and @xmath8 its angular velocity .",
    "the accretion occurs because the gravitational acceleration dominates over the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the reverse takes place and the infalling gas is expelled from the magnetosphere when @xmath9  the rotating magnetic field acts as a propeller . due to coexistence of the inflow and the outflow and hence their counteraction each other around the star - propeller",
    ", the accretion structure may be complex there .",
    "this is not well understood yet .",
    "it is expected that the expelled mass does not leave the star and the envelope builds up around the magnetosphere . in a steady state the magnetic pressure @xmath10 at the upper boundary of the magnetosphere balances the gas pressure @xmath11 just above this boundary : @xmath12    while the mass accumulates , the envelope contracts the magnetosphere until the onset of the accretion phase ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the evolution of the envelope is connected with behavior of the magnetosphere and a simulation of this in comparison with the observations would give an insight into how a propeller operates .    the interaction between the envelope and rotating magnetic field of the star results in a development of a shear layer of width @xmath14 comparable with the free fall length ( wang & robertson 1985 ) : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the escape velocity at @xmath4 , @xmath17 _ in situ _ the effectiveness of damping of the convective motions in the shear layer by turbulent viscosity and is of order 1 .",
    "this width is determined by convection , i.e. by the gravitation effect . in the subsonic case ( @xmath18 ) , which takes place when",
    "the magnetosphere radius is @xmath19 , the form @xmath20 is more appropriate for the shear layer width .",
    "the matter of the envelope penetrates into the shear layer via instabilities .",
    "the magnetic field mixes the matter and forces it to corotate .",
    "these processes determine the radius and state of the envelope .    in the shear layer the star - propeller transfers outside the angular moment and releases energy of rotation .",
    "the equality of the alfvenic and the corotation velocities at the magnetosphere boundary , @xmath21 , is expected in a steady state on average ( wang & robertson 1985 ) .",
    "then the energy release of the propeller is : @xmath22",
    "chcyg  and mwc560  are symbiotic long - period binaries undergoing occasional 2  3 mag outbursts , as do classical sss , but moreover showing a significant mass loss and jet ejection .",
    "their hot continuum radiation originates in the envelope around the wd .",
    "the envelope is observed in bright states , therefore it exists at least some yeas .",
    "the conventional models of symbiotic stars ( mikoajewska & kenyon 1992 ) fail to account for activity in these stars and , in particular , for their high - velocity lumpy outflows and jets . the parameters of these binaries are given in table  1 .",
    ".the binaries parameters . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ orbpar ]      the semi - regular variable chcyg  entered in period of activity in 1963 after almost a century of its observations in quiescence ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the outbursts are characterized by appearance of a hot blue continuum , strong emission lines of hi , hei , feii and [ feii ] and short time photometric variability ( flickering ) , similar to that of cvs . in the outbursts coherent oscillations of light with periods of 500 and 2000  3000 sec",
    "were observed ( mikoajewski et al .",
    "1990 , hoard 1993 ) .",
    "the duration of the outbursts is from one to several years .",
    "the most spectacular phenomenon was a sudden drop of brightness in 1984 with simultaneous ejection of jets with a velocity of about 1000 km / s .",
    "intriguingly , this resembles outbursts in x - ray transients ejecting jets but on much longer timescales . in the outbursts the kinematics and the ionization of the gas evidence a high inhomogeneity and a shock pumping of radiation of the envelope around the wd ( faraggiana & hack 1971 , persic , hack & selvelli 1984 ) . the simultaneous fall and outflow of gas",
    "are observed in the envelope .",
    "the temperature of the envelope changes in the course of an outburst in a range from 7000 to 15000k ( mikolajewska , selvelli & hack 1988 ) .",
    "the activity of the compact companion in the binary chcyg  is powered by gas accretion from the giant s wind . with the adopted parameters of the binary orbit and wind , the accretion mass rate is @xmath23 on average throughout the orbital period .",
    "then the luminosity due to accretion onto the wd surface is @xmath24 .",
    "the optical and iue data show that the hot component luminosity @xmath25 during the bright state in 1981  84 , and that the luminosity changed by a factor of 3.2 during the transitions from low to bright state in 1981 and back in 1984 ( mikoajewski et al .",
    "on the other hand , in quiescence the luminosity of the hot component was below @xmath26 , that is much lower than the wind powered accretion luminosity .",
    "fig.[orbita ] demonstrates the orbital dependence of the luminosity of the accretion onto the wd surface in the case of a spherical accretion of the giant s wind . both , the extremal values and sudden changes of the luminosity of the hot component , as well as the jet ejection , are problematic in a simple accretion model .",
    "the problems become aggravated in connection with the quasi - periodic dips of brightness ( of relatively short - time duration , @xmath27  3 months ) , which were interpreted by skopal et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as eclipses in a triple system , and with the ejection of clumps with velocities up to 2500 km / s visible at least in the orbital plane ( tomov et al . 1996 ) .    in the triple system",
    "the outbursts could be caused by episodic enhanced stripping of the giant at eccentric 756@xmath28 orbit of the interior binary with following energetic accretion of the matter by the compact companion at the outer orbit .",
    "however the quasi - periodic dips could not be explained as eclipses in the triple system ( mikkola & tanikawa 1998 ) .",
    "alternatively , the outbursts could be due to instability of the accretion disk like that of dwarf novae or x - ray transients",
    ". however , there is no reliable evidence of an accretion disk in chcyg . although the propeller is able to put in the circulation of the disk .",
    "the problems may be overcome if one supposes that the compact component of the system is magnetized enough to act like a propeller on ionized infalling matter . in this case",
    "matter necessary for the forthcoming outburst may be stored in a thick envelope , supported against the gravitation by the propeller .",
    "such an envelope will be lumpy and with a flat distribution of density .",
    "when enough mass will be accumulated , the envelope contracts the magnetosphere under the corotation radius and accretion onto the star surface will follow , that is the accretion phase . in the transition between the propeller and accretion phases , through the corotation radius , the envelope structure and the hot component luminosity will abruptly change .",
    "the sudden increase from @xmath29 to @xmath30 in the hot component luminosity in 1981 was probably such a catastrophic transition .",
    "therefore we suppose the maximum propeller luminosity ( when @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 ( the share of release of the gravitation energy of the gas falling onto the magnetosphere of the corotation radius @xmath33 cm , for a star s spin period @xmath34s , is insignificant : @xmath35 ) .    in the steady state on average properties of a propeller are determined by the position of magnetosphere relative to the corotation radius .",
    "the magnetosphere radius is approximately determined by the competition between the magnetic field pressure and gas pressure . in the case of @xmath36 the field strength will be of order @xmath37 g ( from eq.[bal ] ) .",
    "however in the case of the envelope around the magnetosphere the idealization of free fall does not work and it is necessary to calculate self - consistently the interaction of the envelope with the magnetosphere to find @xmath38 .",
    "in other way , the strength of the wd magnetic field can be derived from eq.[lprop ] for the maximum propeller luminosity , i.e. when @xmath31 : @xmath39 this field is strong enough to be measured .",
    "this would be possible only in the case of absence of the envelope .",
    "however the hot blue spectrum is then overwhelmed by the giant , that makes difficult the polarization measurements .    in quiescence",
    "the hot component luminosity is lower than @xmath26 , while the accretion onto the wd surface from the giant s wind would be more energetic ( fig.[orbita ] ) . in a framework of the propeller model",
    "this is suppressed .",
    "when the envelope is negligible the magnetosphere radius may be approximately estimated from the balance between the magnetic pressure at the upper boundary of the magnetosphere and dynamical pressure of free falling gas .",
    "eliminating @xmath4 from eqs .",
    "[ bal ] and [ lprop ] , we have a minimum luminosity of the hot component produced by the interaction of the rotating magnetic field with the wind : @xmath40 this equation defines a field of possible values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in fig.[field ] the permitted values lie above the line corresponding to the propeller luminosity @xmath43 , that equals the minimum hot component luminosity between outbursts ( murset et al .",
    "1991 ) , and to the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "so , for @xmath46@xmath47  the field must be @xmath48 g .",
    "this limit is in good agreement with the estimate of @xmath2 made above on the base of the catastrophic transition , which is evidence of consistency of the propeller model with the observed values of @xmath49 , @xmath3 and @xmath42 .    in a framework of the propeller model , the dips of brightness of chcyg",
    "may be caused by instability of the accretion structure around the magnetosphere , whose energy release strongly depends on radius : @xmath50 ( eq.[lprop ] ) .",
    "possibly , the lumpy nebula around chcyg , that appeared after the notable dip in 1984 , was also caused by the propeller action .",
    "and it is evident that the jet ejection was immediately connected with the catastrophic transition between the accretion and propeller phases , when coupling of the magnetic field and gas is most effective ( then the alfven and corotation velocities are equal ) .",
    "mwc560  is similar to chcyg  ( mikoajewski , tomov & mikoajewska 1997 ) , but differs by the orbit inclination , which is close to @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the approaching jet in mwc560  is observed in blue - shifted absorption lines and sometimes the receding jet is observed in red - shifted emission lines .",
    "the approaching jet developed a maximum velocity of about 7000  kms@xmath52  in the outburst in 1990 ( tomov , kolev , georgiev et al .",
    "it seems that the jets outflows are inherent more or less permanently in polar directions ( see fig .",
    "[ mwccur ] ) , at least from the first observation of the blue - shifted high - velocity absorptions in 1943 ( merrill & burwell 1943 ) .",
    "the gas temperature in the jets is 7000  8000 k. the blue hot continuum of mwc560  can not be fitted either by an accretion disk model or by a model of nuclear burning on the surface of the wd ( panferov , fabrika & tomov 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , these models can not account for the powerful wind and jets .",
    "the hot component radiation originates in the photosphere of the slow ( @xmath53 kms@xmath52 ) powerful ( @xmath54 @xmath47 ) wind with @xmath55 k and a radius of @xmath56 cm .",
    "the low - velocity absorption and emission lines form in this wind .    from the similarity of both stars",
    "the high - velocity permanent polar outflows probably may occur in chcyg  too .",
    "but they might be visible only in outburst as this happened in the biggest outburst in 1984 ( taylor , seaquist & mattei 1986 ) .",
    "the permanent jets suggest a permanent jet engine to exist in these stars independent of details of the accretion structure ( is it an envelope , or an accretion disk , or a ring ) , which strongly supports a propeller as the engine .",
    "mwc560  is one of a few sss having flickering .",
    "mikoajewski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported a huge amplitude flickering of 0.7 magnitude . in 1992",
    "we observed a rare burst in the h@xmath57 line with an amplitude of 3 for half an hour , which resembles quasi - regular bursts in aeaqr . besides there are semicoherent 22 min variations ( dobrzycka , kenyon & milone 1996 ) .",
    "the orbital inclination of mwc560  close to @xmath51 gives us a happy chance to be in the cone of the jet and uv radiation from the deep of the photosphere .",
    "this explains why the hot component radiation is more hard and variable in mwc560  than in chcyg .",
    "also , the correlation of the uv flux and the jet velocity ( fig .  [ mwccur ] ) may be due to the effect of variable optical thickness of the jet .",
    "the observed luminosity of mwc560  is much lower than the critical eddington luminosity .",
    "therefore the radiation mechanisms can not account for the wind and the jets .",
    "we suppose that they are accelerated by a propeller action of the magnetic wd .",
    "then the outburst in 1990 could correspond to the catastrophic transition of the propeller , which means that its luminosity was @xmath58 when @xmath59 .",
    "from eq .",
    "[ bs ] this gives a magnetic field strength @xmath60 g for the supposed wd s spin period @xmath61  min .",
    "the propeller model allows both the nature of the hot component of the binary , and the origin of the jets to be explained in chcyg  and mwc560 .",
    "the observational signatures of a propeller , as inferred from chcyg  and mwc560 , may be as follow :    1 .",
    "erratic variability , when the magnetosphere radius is close or under the corotation radius .",
    "dips of brightness at the times of outbursts , which may be related to a transition accretor  propeller or may be caused by the instability of the accretion structure at the propeller phase .",
    "3 .   wind outflow and jet ejection , which have a maximum rate near the catastrophic transition .",
    "hot component radiation originates in highly inhomogeneous envelope around wd .",
    "the propeller model implies a magnetic field of wd in chcyg  and mwc560to be of order @xmath0  g. measurement of such fields in polarization observations would be a straight way to verify the model .",
    "however this seems to be a very involved problem : the star surface and the magnetosphere are hidden from the observer under the photosphere of the outflowing wind .    in this paper",
    "we suggest only a scheme of the propeller model .",
    "it is believed that gas outflows form around the propeller in some sectors , or nonstationary gas ejection occurs when accretion is replaced by outflow . in some propeller scenarios envelopes or disks",
    "may form round the magnetosphere .",
    "but to define specifically the picture of accretion and outflow has been impossible so far .",
    "so further investigations of the accretion structure in chcyg  and mwc560  are important ."
