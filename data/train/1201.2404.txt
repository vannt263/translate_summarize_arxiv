    "has grown that circumstellar disks around young stars are eroded by uv radiation from massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since these disks are believed to be the origin of planetary systems such as our own , and the majority of stars that form in our galaxy do so in regions containing massive stars , this is of particular importance for a global understanding of star formation .",
    "one of the most significant advances in our understanding of the evolution of protoplanetary disks was the discovery of `` proplyds '' in the orion nebula @xcite , young stellar objects ( ysos ) whose circumstellar material renders them visible either through direct emission or silhouetted against a background hii region .",
    "the proplyds seen in emission have distinctive tadpole shapes with tails pointing away from @xmath2  ori  c @xcite that are well explained by theoretical models of uv photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "proplyds provide illustrative evidence of the evaporation of circumstellar disks in harsh environments .",
    "it is therefore useful to identify them in other systems where photoevaporation might be more widespread .",
    "searches in more massive clusters are hindered by the typically greater distances to them , often leading to the mis - identification of ` evaporating gaseous globules ' ( eggs ) - fragments of an evaporating molecular cloud - as proplyds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "candidate proplyds have so far been identified in ngc  2244 , ic  1396 , ngc  2264 ( all * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , w5 @xcite , the trifid nebula @xcite , the lagoon nebula @xcite , and the carina star - forming region @xcite , but the best candidates outside of orion are those in ngc  3603 @xcite , although these are significantly larger than the orion proplyds .",
    "many of these regions contain only a single candidate proplyd and never has a true family of proplyds similar to those in the orion nebula been found in another region .",
    "cygnus  ob2 is the most massive young association within 2  kpc of the sun .",
    "it lies within the cygnus  x giant molecular cloud where considerable star formation is ongoing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the association contains @xmath365 o - type stars @xcite and therefore provides an excellent sample of the influence of massive stars on the evolution of circumstellar disks .",
    "a recent x - ray survey by @xcite identified @xmath11500 lower - mass ysos , while @xcite found evidence for an age spread among them from 35  myr .",
    "this is consistent with evidence for o stars as young as 1  myr @xcite , and an older population with an age of 57  myr @xcite .",
    "the central cluster has cleared away the majority of molecular gas in the vicinity of the association @xcite , but recent observations have revealed sites of ongoing star formation around the periphery ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we present the discovery of 10 objects in the vicinity of cygnus ob2 that appear remarkably similar to the orion proplyds . in section  2",
    "we present the observations used to identify and characterize them , in section  3 we discuss their physical properties and consider their true nature , and finally in section  4 we discuss the implications of this finding for our understanding of the propagation of star formation in cygnus  ob2 .",

    "we enumerate the objects and adopt the iphas naming system based on their right ascension and declination .",
    "one of these objects , # 5 , was identified as an h@xmath0 emission source by @xcite and labelled iphasx  j203311.5 + 404141 during an automated search of iphas images for compact planetary nebulae .",

    "object # 7 , also known as iras  20324 + 4057 , was observed by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) on 2006 july 22 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , 0.05/ pixel ) .",
    "observations used the broad - band filters f606w ( @xmath14  , @xmath15  , approximately @xmath16+@xmath17 ) and f814w ( @xmath18  , @xmath19  , approximately a broad @xmath20 filter ) .",
    "two observations were made in each filter , for a total exposure of 694s per filter .",
    "a color image of # 7 compiled from these observations is shown in figure  [ images3 ] .",
    "some of these objects have previous identifications , either through their extended emission or their central stars , however none have previously been identified as proplyds or eggs .",
    "some were detected in the infrared , the sub - mm , or radio ( see table  [ proplyds ] ) .",
    "objects 3 , 5 , and 7 were identified as possible ob stars by @xcite based on near - ir photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy , suggesting that the central stars of these objects may be more massive than the typical proplyds seen in orion .",
    "they found that # 3 exhibits possible h@xmath21 and co emission that could originate from a massive circumstellar disk , as the mid - ir images corroborate , while # 7 shows br@xmath22 in emission , most likely originating from the nebulosity .",
    "object # 7 was also imaged by @xcite during a search for post - agb candidates and was identified as an hii region with a bow shock .",
    "spectra revealed nebular emission lines in a ratio that implied photoionization consistent with ionization by massive stars , rather than shock - excitation .",
    "we now discuss the structure and morphology of the objects and consider the evidence that they are true proplyds like those seen in orion , or if they are eggs like those observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that , unlike many of the orion proplyds , these objects are all seen in emission and not in silhouette ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the silhouettes in orion are the actual disks themselves , which would not be resolvable at the greater distance of cygnus  ob2 with the observations available .",
    "the positions and sizes of these objects are summarized in table  [ proplyds ] .",
    "all the structures in figures  24 are clearly tadpole shaped with extended tails pointing away from cyg  ob2 .",
    "they are rim - brightened on the side facing the ob association clearly indicating that they are being photoionized by the massive stars in cyg  ob2 .",
    "some show very similar morphologies to orion proplyds .",
    "for example , # 4 shares the ` safety pin ' shape of d177 - 341 @xcite , where the thin sides of the proplyd appear to join up at the end of its tail in a small clump . however , there are minor differences between these proplyds and those in orion .",
    "objects 2 , 5 , & 6 show distinctly non - axisymmetric shapes with many small clumps .",
    "the hst image of # 7 in figure  [ images3 ] also reveals an interesting non - axisymmetry : the ionization brightness varies between the northern and southern sides of its tail . a foreground extinction gradient might cause this , although the required gradient angular size of @xmath110@xmath23 renders this unlikely",
    "these asymmetries may suggest that these are not proplyds , since the orion proplyds are clearly symmetric .",
    "however , proplyd morphology is determined by the ionizing flux @xcite , and here cygnus  ob2 differs significantly from the orion nebula or ngc  3603 .",
    "the massive stars in cyg  ob2 are distributed over a wider area ( figure  1 ) , and not centrally - concentrated like those in other regions , so the ionizing flux emanates from a broader area .",
    "@xcite showed that the ratio of far - uv to extreme - uv flux is important in determining the properties of the resulting photo - evaporative flow and photoionized morphology .",
    "since this ratio varies across the o - type spectral class , the positions of different o - type stars across cygnus  ob2 will result in variation of the flow in different directions and could explain the observed asymmetries .",
    "the lengths of these objects range from 18,000 to 113,000  au ( table  [ proplyds ] ) , making them larger than both the orion proplyds ( 40400  au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the hitherto largest - known ` giant proplyds ' in ngc  3603 ( @xmath115,00021,000  au , * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of smaller objects is a selection effect due to the greater distance of cyg  ob2 and the ground - based imaging from which they were discovered .",
    "the large sizes of these objects , orders of magnitude larger than the orion proplyds , suggests that they could be eggs , which occupy a large range of sizes .",
    "despite this the large sizes of these objects can actually be explained by current models of proplyd photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "proplyd size depends on how far the ionization front caused by stellar lyman continuum photons can penetrate into the outflowing photo - dissociation region formed from evaporating circumstellar material ( heated by balmer continuum photons ) .",
    "the size of the proplyd scales inversely with the ionizing extreme uv flux , and therefore should scale with the distance to the source of ionizing radiation , as seen in the orion nebula @xcite .    while the o stars in cyg  ob2 are spread over a large area , we can approximate the center of the association to be mid - way between the two main groups of massive stars , the northern clump containing cyg  ob2 # 8 and the southern clump dominated by cyg  ob2 # 22 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these proplyd - like objects are at projected distances from this center of @xmath11434@xmath24 , or @xmath1614  pc ( see table  [ proplyds ] ) .",
    "we find no correlation between this projected distance and the length of the object , suggesting that both these objects and the o stars are sufficiently distributed along the line of sight that their projected separations are misleading .",
    "however , the typical sizes of the orion and ngc  3603 proplyds and these objects ( @xmath1100 , @xmath120,000 , and @xmath170,000  au respectively ) do scale with their projected distances from the source of ionization ( @xmath25  pc , 12  pc , and @xmath1614  pc , respectively ) , supporting a broader correlation .",
    "proplyds , by definition , include an embedded yso with a protoplanetary disk , while fragments of molecular cloud material may not . in their deep near - ir study of eggs in the eagle nebula , @xcite could only identify protostars in 15% of the globules , at extinctions up to @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that either most eggs do not contain central stars , or if they do are so heavily embedded as to escape detection .    to assess the fraction of these objects that contain central stars we searched for point sources in the ukidss near - ir images , finding good candidates in 7 of the 10 objects",
    "this fraction is significantly higher than that found by @xcite , despite the fact that our observations are @xmath13 magnitudes shallower than theirs ( the two regions are at similar distances ) .",
    "all these sources are also detected in _",
    "mid - ir observations , suggesting these sources have circumstellar material .",
    "the remaining 3 sources appear more complex ; # 1 shows mid - ir emission , but is faint and not clearly associated with a central star candidate ; # 10 shows only a very faint near - ir point source and no mid - ir source ; and # 6 has no good candidate near- or mid - ir source .",
    "the detected central source fraction of 70% appears more consistent with the proplyd scenario than with the egg scenario .",
    "many of these point sources are particularly bright at 24  @xmath13 m , suggesting a significant mass of cool dust that would be more consistent with embedded class  i sources as opposed to disk - bearing class  ii sources .",
    "this fact , coupled with the failure of either the proplyd or egg scenarios to fully explain all the observations , leads us to consider a third scenario .",
    "these objects may represent a more advanced stage of egg evolution , whereby empty eggs have fully evaporated but those with central stars , which may also be the densest and most massive , have survived the photoevaporation process .",
    "this scenario requires further verification but explains many of the observations that the other scenarios do not .",
    "if correct it raises new questions such as how the photoevaporation of star - forming eggs influences the final mass of the embedded stars and how this affects the initial mass function in the vicinity of massive clusters .",
    "regardless of their true nature the presence of clear central star candidates with circumstellar material implies that these objects are very young .",
    "if they are proplyds it is well known that irradiated protoplanetary disks are thought to be evaporated in @xmath271  myr @xcite , whereas if these are some sort of star - forming egg they are likely to be even younger .",
    "these objects must therefore represent a younger and more - recent population of star formation in the cygnus region than the slightly older cyg  ob2 association itself . the wide - field view in figure  [ cygnus_wide ]",
    "shows the location of the objects relative to the cyg  ob2 association .",
    "the objects are located to the south - east of the main core of the association , approximately half - way between cyg  ob2 and the recently discovered cluster in the hii region dr  15 @xcite , supporting propagation of star formation in a southerly direction .",
    "the formation of these objects and the dr  15 cluster may therefore have been triggered by stellar winds or uv radiation from the massive stars in cyg  ob2 or they may have formed anyway and are only now being influenced by cyg  ob2 . differentiating between these two scenarios is important for understand the propagation of star formation in massive clusters and associations such as this .",
    "we have presented multi - wavelength images of 10 proplyd - like objects in the vicinity of the nearby massive association cygnus  ob2 .",
    "their tadpole - like shapes , clearly visible in iphas h@xmath0 images , are oriented towards the central ob association .",
    "we have considered the arguments that these are either true proplyds like those in orion , or photoionized fragments of molecular cloud material known as eggs .",
    "these objects are notably different from the orion proplyds , in terms of their larger sizes , asymmetries , and large distances from the source of ionization , but we argue that these factors do not necessarily disprove that they are proplyds and can all be explained under the current model of disk photoevaporation .",
    "we show that their large sizes are in agreement with the predicted scaling of proplyd size with distance from the ionizing source , and argue that their asymmetries can be partly explained by the extended distribution of o stars across cyg  ob2 and therefore the complex uv flux distribution .",
    "we identify embedded central stars in 70% of the objects using near- and mid - ir images , a significantly larger fraction than observed in eggs in other star forming regions and closer to the 100% expected for proplyds .",
    "we conclude that neither scenario adequately explains the observed properties of these objects and therefore consider a third possibility that these are an intermediate class of object representing the subset of star - forming eggs that have survived the photoevaporation of the molecular cloud .",
    "if this is the case , and these objects are still accreting from their natal molecular cloud , it raises the question of whether photoevaporation from massive stars could influence the initial mass function in regions such as this .",
    "a future paper will present a complete analysis of the photometric properties of the central stars and the long - wavelength emission from circumstellar material , combined with an analysis of the uv radiation field from cygnus  ob2 .",
    "further observations may be necessary to determine the true nature of these objects , such as spectroscopy of the central stars and the ionized gas associated with them , or co observations to ascertain the mass of the gas reservoir .",
