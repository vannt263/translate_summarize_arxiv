    "the majority of our analysis is based on the spectroscopic dataset of @xcite , who obtained high - s / n spectra for globular clusters in seven early - type galaxies ( ngc 1380 , 2434 , 3115 , 3379 , 3585 , 5846 , and 7192 ) with the fors multi - object spectrograph at eso s _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) .",

    "such an imf extending to high masses can reproduce the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of virtually all globular clusters in spirals and the majority of globular clusters in lenticular galaxies , but not the most extreme [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios of globular clusters in elliptical galaxies .",
    "a significant contribution of massive stars @xmath5 is necessary to boost the [ @xmath0/fe ]  beyond @xmath51 dex ( see fig .",
    "[ ps : amac ] ) .",
    "the ejecta of pair - instability sne , which require very metal - poor progenitor stars , are expected to be rich in @xmath0-elements @xcite .",
    "our calculations indicate that the parent gas clouds of globular clusters can be enriched to extreme [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios by pair - instability sne with masses @xmath52 .",
    "we find that hypernovae with progenitor masses @xmath53 are ruled out as primary contributors to gas with @xmath54 } \\ga 0.4 $ ] since their ejecta are not @xmath0-enriched enough .",
    "we assume that the extreme globular clusters considered here have similar masses to milky way globular clusters .",
    "e.g. , for a typical mass of @xmath55 , and measured metallicities of up to [ z / h ]  @xmath56 , the total _ metal _ content of the parent gas cloud amounts to up to @xmath57 .",
    "one way of producing this amount of metals is to assume a progenitor / enriching stellar population composed of high - mass ( @xmath58 ) stars only ( i.e. a progenitor stellar population with an imf truncated at the lower end at @xmath59 ) , combined with a sufficiently high star - formation rate in order to enable the formation of such massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in any other scenario , the extreme [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios require extremely short enrichment timescales , i.e.  a very short time between the sn explosion of massive stars and the formation of globular clusters : of the order of the lifetime of a @xmath60 star , corresponding to a few myr .    our empirical result that globular clusters with such extreme chemical compositions mainly reside in early - type galaxies but seem absent in spirals suggests a fundamental difference in enrichment timescales between some phase(s ) of globular cluster system formation .    a bimodality in the [ @xmath0/fe ]  distribution , as hinted by the top right panel of fig",
    "[ ps : amah ] , would imply a cessation of globular cluster formation processes over a period short enough to be unresolved in age ( on the scale of figure  [ ps : amac ] @xmath61 yr ) , but lasting long enough to allow a significant chemical contribution from lower - mass stars ( @xmath62 , i.e.  few @xmath63 yr ) .",
    "speculating whether such a delay could occur in the course of massive galaxy evolution , we note that it might be introduced by the reionization epoch at redshifts @xmath64 , which for a few @xmath65 years may have halted , or at least suppressed , the formation of massive star clusters and enabled the generation of less @xmath0-enriched globular clusters which seem to dominate gcss in lenticulars and spirals .",
    "we compare our observational result for globular clusters with photochemical evolution models of elliptical galaxies by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ ps : amac ] we plot the predictions for [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios for two galaxies with @xmath66 and @xmath67 initial baryonic mass .",
    "the direct comparison shows that extreme [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios can only be achieved within the first @xmath68 gyr after the ignition of star formation processes .",
    "further , the models predict similar total metallicities as those of the most metal - rich extremely @xmath0-enhanced globular cluster in our sample .",
    "note that the absolute starburst ignition time is arbitrarily set in the models ; i.e. , one can delay the starburst ignition time by an arbitrary amount which would leave the predictions of [ @xmath0/fe ]  as a function of time _",
    "after _ the burst unchanged .",
    "the delay between the bursts of @xmath67 and @xmath69 , on the other hand , _ is _ fixed in the models , and depends on the total gas mass in a given halo .",
    "this implies that less - massive starbursts , occurring later from material with a similar chemical composition as for more massive starbursts , can produce globular clusters with similarly high [ @xmath0/fe]ratios , but with younger ages . in a hierarchical galaxy formation picture",
    "these younger clusters are subsequently merged into more massive halos .",
    "it is important to realize that the very high [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios for old globular clusters in elliptical galaxies are _ not _ mirrored in the _ average _ [ @xmath0/fe ]  of the field stellar population as measured from the diffuse light .  using the same ssp models as in this study",
    ", @xcite recently found that early - type galaxies have lower luminosity - weighted [ @xmath0/fe ]  values ( @xmath11[@xmath0/fe]@xmath70 ) with very few galaxies showing [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath71 dex , i.e. , values comparable to those of the low-[@xmath0/fe ]  peak of globular clusters in ellipticals and most clusters in lenticular and spiral galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the formation of massive globular clusters with extremely high [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios predates the formation of the _ majority of stars _ in elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , we emphasize that our findings do _ not _ exclude the presence of some extremely @xmath0-enriched field stars in elliptical galaxies .",
    "interestingly , this would be consistent with the popular scenario in which stars are born in star clusters and gradually become part of the diffuse light through evaporation by two - body relaxation and tidal stripping of the star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .  indeed ,",
    "the timescale of such disruption mechanisms is very long ( more than a hubble time ) for massive globular clusters of @xmath3710@xmath72 and shorter for less massive ones ( @xmath73 for two - body relaxation ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that most of the diffuse light in ellipticals would originate , in such a scenario , from lower - mass clusters , most of which dissolved after a few gyr or sooner ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this actually suggests that lower - mass clusters in ellipticals should generally _ not _ show [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath74 0.4 , which would imply a later formation .",
    "these predictions should be testable in the near future .",
    "we present [ @xmath0/fe ] , metallicity , and age distributions of globular clusters in elliptical , lenticular , and spiral galaxies , that were derived from lick line index measurement and identify a population of globular clusters with extreme [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios .",

    "<S> we compare [ @xmath0/fe ] , metallicity , and age distributions of globular clusters in elliptical , lenticular , and spiral galaxies , which we derive from lick line index measurements .  </S>",
    "<S> we find a large number of globular clusters in elliptical galaxies that reach significantly higher [ @xmath0/fe ]  values ( [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath1 ) than any clusters in lenticular and spiral galaxies .  </S>",
    "<S> most of these extremely @xmath0-enriched globular clusters are old ( @xmath2 gyr ) and cover the metallicity range @xmath3 [ z / h]@xmath4 .  </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with supernova yield models suggests that the progenitor gas clouds of these globular clusters must have been predominantly enriched by massive stars ( @xmath5 ) with little contribution from lower - mass stars .  </S>",
    "<S> the measured [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios are also consistent with yields of very massive pair - instability supernovae ( @xmath6 ) .  </S>",
    "<S> both scenarios imply that the chemical enrichment of the progenitor gas was completed on extremely short timescales of the order of a few myr .  </S>",
    "<S> given the lower [ @xmath0/fe ]  average ratios of the diffuse stellar population in early - type galaxies , our results suggest that these extremely @xmath0-enhanced globular clusters could be members of the very first generation of star clusters formed , and that their formation epochs would predate the formation of the majority of stars in giant early - type galaxies . </S>"
