    "various specifications of spatial autoregressive models have been proposed in past and current literature ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the spatial models introduced by @xcite were extended to incorporate external regressors ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview ) , and autocorrelated residuals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "currently , these spatial models are widely implemented in statistical software packages such that it is simple to model spatial clusters of high and low observations .",
    "consequently , a wide range of applications can be found in empirical research , including econometrics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , biometrics ( e.g. , @xcite ) or environmetrics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , spatial models that assume spatially dependent second - order moments , such as the well - known autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ( arch ) and generalized arch ( garch ) models in time series analysis proposed by @xcite and @xcite , have not been previously discussed . @xcite and @xcite introduced a temporal garch model , which includes temporal lags influenced by neighboring observations . regarding the two - dimensional setting",
    ", @xcite suggested a special type of a spatial arch model , the sarch(1 ) process , that results from employing the information matrix ( i m ) test statistic in a simple spatial autoregressive ( sar ) model .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite introduced a multidimensional garch process to detect image anomalies .",
    "however , present extensions consider only special approaches , and no general model has been presented .",
    "moreover , there is no strict analytical analysis of the introduced models , and it appears that generalization of an arch or garch model to the multidimensional setting is not straightforward .    to motivate the need for a spatial arch model , we consider the following empirical example . in figure",
    "[ fig : motivation ] , the population density of all u.s .",
    "counties excluding alaska and hawaii ( @xmath0 ) is plotted on the map .",
    "the data are from the 2010 census .",
    "obviously , there are clusters of high population density around metropolitan areas and clusters of low population density elsewhere .",
    "this behavior can be modeled by a spatial autoregressive process ; i.e. , the observations are assumed to be influenced by their neighbors .",
    "the dependence between the observations can be modeled via a so - called spatial weighting matrix @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , a simple spatial autoregressive process includes an autoregressive parameter @xmath2 .",
    "fitting the u.s .",
    "census data using this type of process leads to a model with a positive spatial correlation of @xmath3 ; i.e. , the process identifies clusters of high and low values .",
    "this finding is not surprising .",
    "however , if we focus on the estimated residuals of the process , we observe that they are not homoscedastic but rather exhibit clusters of high and low variances , whereas the mean of the residuals is zero and not spatially autocorrelated .",
    "this means that we observe clustering behavior in the conditional spatial variances but not in the conditional means . for spatial autoregressive processes ,",
    "the conditional variance is also not constant over space .",
    "however , the conditional variance of each location is independent of the variance of the surrounding locations ; it depends only on the spatial weights .",
    "thus , a new nonlinear attempt , a spatial process for conditional heteroscedasticity , is needed to achieve the required flexibility of the model . to illustrate these variance clusters , we computed for each county the sample standard deviation of the residuals lying within a radius of 500 @xmath4 ( 310.686 @xmath5 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : motivation ] , the conditional sample standard deviation is visualized on the map ( below , left ) and by means of a simple histogram ( below , right ) . obviously , we observe two major clusters of the residual s variance : the variance is higher in the eastern united states compared with the western united states",
    ". moreover , these two clusters are also obvious in the histogram .",
    "the estimated variance of the error process is @xmath6 .",
    "certainly , the appearance of these clusters depends on the choice of the distance used for the calculation of the sample standard deviation .",
    "however , when other distances are used , we observe the same behavior .",
    "+   ( 310.686 @xmath5 ) of the fitted spatial autoregressive process ( @xmath7 , @xmath6 ) is shown below.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a further aspect that should be mentioned is that for spatial kriging , the underlying spatial process is usually assumed to be stationary and isotropic ; i.e. , the covariance between two observations depends only on the distance between these observations , not on the location of the observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others , have introduced various approaches to treat nonstationary spatial processes . for such processes ,",
    "the spatial covariance matrix depends on both the location of each observation and the distances between all locations .",
    "moreover , @xcite , and @xcite discussed nonstationary spatiotemporal models .",
    "whereas the focus of these approaches is mostly to obtain accurate temporal forecasts or spatial interpolations , the so - called kriging , our paper aims to propose a spatial process with similar properties to the temporal arch process proposed by @xcite , i.e. , conditional heteroscedasticity .",
    "hence , the entries of the spatial covariance matrix depend not only on the location and the distance between observations , as in nonstationary spatial processes , but also on the variance of locations nearby .",
    "in particular , we compare our spatial arch model and the temporal arch model with respect to important properties .",
    "moreover , we illustrate the use of the spatial arch model as a residual process for spatial modeling of lung cancer mortality in the u.s . counties .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in the ensuing section ,",
    "we introduce the spatial arch model .",
    "moreover , we derive important properties of the process . in section [ sec : weighting_matrix ] , two specifications of the spatial weighting matrix suitable for empirical research are discussed .",
    "furthermore , we present some results regarding statistical inference , and we discuss an estimation procedure based on the maximum - likelihood principle . in an empirical study , we demonstrate how our results can be applied .",
    "moreover , the results of various simulation studies are reported to yield better insight into the behavior of the spatial arch process .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper and provides some discussion of possible extensions and generalizations of the process .",
    "assume that @xmath8 is a univariate spatial stochastic process , where @xmath9 is a subset of the @xmath10-dimensional set of real numbers @xmath11 , the @xmath10-dimensional set of integers @xmath12 , or the cartesian product @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "regarding the first case , a continuous process is present if a @xmath10-dimensional rectangle of positive volume in @xmath9 exists ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . considering the second case , the resulting process is a spatial lattice process .",
    "moreover , spatiotemporal settings are covered regarding the @xmath10-dimensional set of integers and the product set @xmath13 because the temporal dimension can be considered as one dimension of the @xmath10-dimensional space . for instance",
    ", a spatiotemporal lattice process with two spatial dimensions would lie in the set of three - dimensional integers .",
    "let @xmath15 denote all locations and @xmath16 be the vector of observations @xmath17 .",
    "the commonly applied spatial autoregressive model assumes that the conditional variance of @xmath18 depends only on the spatial weighting matrix ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , not the observations at the neighboring locations .",
    "this approach is extended assuming that the conditional variance can vary over space , resulting in clusters of high and low variance .",
    "analogous to the arch time series model of @xcite , the vector of observations is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is assumed to be an independent and identically distributed random error with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , the identity matrix is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the vector @xmath24 is specified as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a diagonal matrix with the entries of @xmath27 on the diagonal . using the hadamard product denoted by @xmath28",
    ", this equation can be rewritten such that @xmath29 the @xmath30 matrix @xmath1 consists of spatial weights .",
    "the elements of @xmath1 are assumed to be non - stochastic , nonnegative and zero on the main diagonal to prevent observations from influencing themselves .",
    "moreover , each component of the vector @xmath31 is assumed to be nonnegative .",
    "hence , the @xmath32-th entry of @xmath33 at location @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 refers to @xmath37-th entry of @xmath1 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 does not seem to depend on @xmath41 .",
    "however , because @xmath40 depends on @xmath42 and these quantities depend on @xmath18 via @xmath43 , this is not the case",
    ". we shall discuss this point later in more detail .",
    "regarding this specification of @xmath33 , we refer to the resulting process as the spatial arch model ( sparch ) . if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the @xmath46-dimensional vector of ones , and @xmath47 , the resulting process coincides with the spatial white noise process .",
    "the abovementioned spatiotemporal process could be modeled by defining the locations @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the spatial location and @xmath50 represents the point of time . for spatiotemporal settings , one must assume additionally that the weights of the locations @xmath51 and @xmath52 are zero if @xmath53 . in the following section [ sec : weighting_matrix ] ,",
    "we demonstrate how the weighting matrix must be defined for several temporal and spatiotemporal settings that have been proposed in the literature . to express the model in a more convenient manner , the time point @xmath54",
    "can also be written as an index .",
    "for that reason , the number of included temporal lags is denoted by @xmath55 , and the set of all spatial locations is @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the process can be specified as @xmath57 it is worth noting that the spatial weighting parameters @xmath58 might depend on the temporal lag . for @xmath59",
    ", @xmath58 describes the instantaneous spatial effect .",
    "furthermore , one can rewrite the equation in matrix notation ; that is , @xmath60 in the following paragraphs , we omit the index @xmath54 .",
    "the weighting matrix @xmath1 may depend on additional parameters .",
    "possible choices for @xmath1 include , e.g. , @xmath61 with a known weighting matrix @xmath62 or @xmath63 with a decreasing function @xmath64 . here",
    ", @xmath65 stands for the vector norm . in section [ sec : weighting_matrix ] , we discuss some special weighting matrices in more detail .",
    "next , we focus on the conditions on the parameters such that the process is well defined .",
    "initially , it is analyzed whether @xmath16 is uniquely determined by @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath68    [ th : f_eps ] suppose that @xmath69 then , there is one and only one @xmath70 that corresponds to each @xmath71 .",
    "it holds that @xmath72    because of the complex dependence structure , i.e. , @xmath18 depends on @xmath73 for all @xmath74 and vice versa , it turns out that the components of @xmath75 are not necessarily nonnegative ; thus , the square root of @xmath40 might not exist . the choice of the weighting matrix @xmath1 affects whether all elements of the squared observations @xmath75 are greater than or equal to zero .",
    "moreover , this condition also depends on the realizations of the error vector @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , we further analyze the required condition such that the components of @xmath75 are nonnegative .",
    "[ th : sparch ] suppose that @xmath76 , @xmath77 for all @xmath78 , @xmath79 for all @xmath39 and that @xmath80 .",
    "if all elements of the matrix @xmath81 are nonnegative , then all components of @xmath75 are nonnegative ; i.e. , @xmath82 for @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , @xmath83 for @xmath39 .",
    "in general , it seems to be difficult to check whether the condition given in theorem [ th : sparch ] is fulfilled because it depends on both the weighting matrix @xmath1 and the error vector @xmath66 .",
    "however , in the important case in which @xmath1 is an upper or lower triangular matrix , the condition is always satisfied .",
    "[ lemma : triangular ] suppose that @xmath76 , @xmath77 for all @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "all elements of the matrix @xmath81 are then nonnegative .",
    "triangular matrices of spatial weights are of high practical relevance because the resulting spatial process can be observed as an oriented process .",
    "this means that the process evolves in a certain direction . in the case of a lower triangular matrix @xmath1 ,",
    "the location @xmath87 is regarded as the origin of the process . for the case of an arbitrary weighting matrix @xmath1 , we need a criterion that can be more easily checked than that of theorem [ th : sparch ] . another possibility is given in the next lemma .",
    "[ lemma : nontriangular ] suppose that @xmath76 , @xmath77 for all @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 then all elements of the matrix @xmath81 are nonnegative .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath90 denotes some induced matrix norm , then is fulfilled if @xmath91 ( cf .",
    "theorem 18.2.19 of @xcite ) .    to take a closer look at the condition in the above lemma [ lemma : nontriangular ]",
    ", we consider two simple examples .    [ bsp : n2 ] initially , the simple sparch process for @xmath92 is considered in more detail , which means that the process has exactly two observations @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the two locations @xmath87 and @xmath95 .",
    "simple calculations show that @xmath96 these quantities are nonnegative if and only if @xmath76 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 consequently , @xmath100 , and by analogy , @xmath101 .",
    "thus , all quantities are well defined .",
    "choosing in lemma [ lemma : nontriangular ] the norm @xmath102 , it can be observed that the aforementioned condition is equivalent to condition .",
    "this result shows that the support of @xmath103 must be bounded ; otherwise , there arise problems with the interpretation of the model quantities .",
    "hence , condition must also be understood in this manner .",
    "this means that the support of the error quantities must be bounded in a certain manner . in the general case , the condition on the induced norm is more difficult to check . therefore , we consider in the next example that the support of the error term is compact .",
    "[ bsp : finite_support ] suppose that @xmath104 is taking values on a finite support .",

    "we observe a tradeoff between the weighting coefficients and the parameter @xmath109 . to be precise , if the weighting coefficients increase , one would expect that the spatial autocorrelation of the squared observations would increase by the same magnitude .",
    "however , increasing values of the elements in @xmath1 imply smaller values of @xmath109 , which reduces the extent of the spatial autocorrelation .",
    "we focus on this issue in more detail in section [ sec : mc ] .",
