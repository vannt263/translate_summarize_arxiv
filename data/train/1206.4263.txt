    "we are already at a point where we have excellent constraints on the spatial distribution and properties of galaxies in the local universe from the largest surveys ever undertaken , namely the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",

    "over the past few years these surveys to study the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe , and how they trace the large - scale structure of the universe , have been complemented by deeper and narrower surveys at all wavelengths , carefully balancing depth and area to ensure that representative volumes of the universe are observed .",
    "most notably the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) is now taking the surveys carried out within ukidss one step further , with its larger field of view and improved sensitivity at the bluer ( @xmath23 ) wavelengths of the near - infrared window .",
    "vista is undertaking several near - infrared public surveys , one of which is the vista deep extragalactic observations ( video ) survey .",
    "the aim of the video survey is to gain a representative view of the universe at @xmath24 , allowing galaxy evolution to be traced over the majority of the history of the universe , from the richest clusters to the field .",
    "the video survey fields are chosen to incorporate current and future multi - wavelength data sets to facilitate the broadest exploitation of the new near - infrared survey data both within eso and across the globe .",
    "the main scientific aims of video are described below . throughout this paper",
    "we use the ab - magnitude system @xcite and adopt the concordance cosmology @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27kms@xmath28mpc@xmath28 .",
    "how and when were massive galaxies formed ? when did they assemble the bulk of their stellar mass and how ? where does this mass assembly occur ?",
    "these are crucial questions which video is designed to answer .",
    "the advent of deep multi - wavelength surveys has led to huge progress in this field .",
    "there are two ways to measure the build - up of stellar mass : by directly observing star formation , or by measuring the total stellar mass already formed by a given epoch .",
    "the first technique was revolutionised by the lyman break technique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which found large numbers of star - forming galaxies at @xmath29 and galex has stretched this to lower redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , these techniques are only sensitive to relatively unobscured systems , and are known to miss much of the luminosity density arising from galaxies at @xmath30(e.g . * ? ? ?",

    "herschel space observatory _ is now opening up our view of the universe with both wide- ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and deep - field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys , which together probe sufficient volume over a large fraction of cosmic time to determine the full spectral energy distribution of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also the evolution of dust and obscured star formation in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , mass estimates of distant galaxies require rest - frame near - infrared wavelength observations to study the parts of galaxy spectral energy distributions that are not dominated by young stars with low mass - to - light ratios .",
    "surveys with ground - based near - infrared observations have allowed substantial recent progress in this area ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particularly at the bright end of the luminosity function at @xmath31 where both area and moderately deep data are required .",
    "surveys such as the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) probe to much greater depths but only cover very small sky areas , resulting in studies concentrating on the faint galaxy populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galaxies at very high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these surveys have led the way in probing galaxy evolution from the earliest times up until the present day , but they are fundamentally limited by the fact that they can not probe scales larger than a few mpc , severely limiting investigations of the environmental dependence of galaxy formation and evolution .    the goal of video is to perform an in - depth study of the universe over the redshift range @xmath16 , linking the shallower surveys such as the ukidss - las @xcite , the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) and the vista kilo - degree survey ( viking ) with the deeper ultravista survey @xcite .",
    "the depths of the video survey have been chosen to detect galaxies at the knee in the galaxy luminosity function , @xmath32 at @xmath33 , and down to @xmath34 at @xmath35 , thereby enabling us to detect the bulk of the luminosity density arising from galaxies over 90 per cent of the history of the universe and the most massive galaxies at the highest redshifts .",
    "thus we will be able to investigate in exquisite detail which galaxies are in place first , and address the issue of downsizing in the mass function of forming galaxies , where the massive early type galaxies appear to be in place before the less massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also important to note that the epoch over which video is aimed is a crucial one in the history of the universe , as this is when the bulk of the star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) activity took place .",
    "this is thus the ideal survey with which to investigate the effects that star formation and accretion activity have on galaxy evolution in general .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic rarity of the most luminous agn , starburst and elliptical galaxies means that it is important to survey a large enough area from which the luminosity function and clustering of particular galaxy populations can be constrained , thereby enabling the evolution of bias to be determined , improving on previous area - limited surveys that have measured the clustering of various galaxy populations to only @xmath36degree scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "crucially , video will have sufficient area to carry out these investigations as a function of both redshift and environment .",
    "video will not only be able to detect the galaxies which contribute the bulk of the luminosity density at these redshifts , but the five near - infrared filters , along with ancillary data from optical surveys and the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", will provide photometric redshifts for galaxies as faint as @xmath32 all the way out to @xmath33 , and to @xmath37 for the most massive galaxies .",
    "in addition to probing the sub-@xmath32 population up to @xmath38 , video will be uniquely placed to quantify the density and spatial clustering of the most massive galaxies at the earliest epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "initial work on this topic by @xcite used the combined data from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls - d1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with the wircam infrared deep survey ( wirds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ultravista@xcite and video to show that the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath39 follows an exponential decline and that these massive galaxies appear to be both larger and more dusty than their fainter counterparts discovered in deep hst imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the full video survey area we will be able carry out the first statistically - significant clustering analysis of massive galaxies towards the epoch of reionization , providing a direct link between the underlying dark matter distribution and galaxy populations and how this evolves up to the highest redshifts .",
    "we note that the video survey will detect a factor of @xmath40 more @xmath41m@xmath42 galaxies than ultravista at @xmath43 , as the limiting factor is area rather than depth .",
    "however , we emphasise that the combination of video and ultravista will provide the premier data set for investigating the clustering properties of the highest redshift ( @xmath44 ) galaxies as a function of mass .",
    "video provides data over the area and depth with which to study the evolution of galaxy clusters from their formation epoch to the present day .",
    "galaxy clusters are essential tracers of cosmic evolution in the universe for two important reasons .",
    "first , clusters are the largest virialized objects whose masses we can measure .",
    "consequently , comparisons of the present - day cluster mass distribution with the distributions at earlier epochs can be used to determine the rate of structure formation , placing constraints on cosmological models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "second , the deep potential wells of clusters also mean that they act as closed astrophysical laboratories that retain their gaseous matter .",
    "therefore clusters possess a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation such as the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects which feedback processes have on galaxy formation .    between @xmath45 , clusters of galaxies appear to undergo little in the way of strong evolution , either in their gas phase properties or in the properties of the more massive galaxies within them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the epoch at @xmath46 is therefore a crucial one for studying their evolution , which must be dramatic in the 4  gyr between @xmath47 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the depth of video is such that it can trace the bright end of the cluster luminosity function to @xmath48 and look in detail at the less luminous cluster galaxies to @xmath49 , while its area should provide a sample of several tens of clusters with masses above @xmath50  m@xmath42 at @xmath51",
    ". once found , such galaxy clusters can be studied in great detail in terms of their galaxy populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and agn content ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to trace how galaxies form and evolve in _ closed _ and dense environments",
    ". furthermore , the shear number of clusters will allow the average properties of clusters to be studied in detail as a function of cosmic epoch @xcite .",
    "the sdss has revolutionised studies of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) at the highest redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing the first evidence that the epoch of reionization was coming to an end around @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "deeper optical surveys have since been pushing further down the qso luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but pushing to higher redshifts is impossible with optical surveys , regardless of depth , due to the fact that the gunn - peterson trough occupies all optical bands at @xmath53 .",
    "this work is being driven to higher redshift with near - infrared surveys such as the ukidss large area survey , which recently discovered a qso at @xmath54 @xcite and the next step for this work will be with the wide - area vista public surveys such as viking and the vista hemisphere survey , which will probe the bright end of the qso luminosity function at @xmath55 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the shape of the qso luminosity function at these redshifts can only be studied with much deeper near - infrared imaging over a significant survey area .",
    "this is the only direct way to determine the contribution of accreting black holes to the reionization of the universe and constrain the density of black - holes within the first gyr after the big bang , as just using the brightest quasars requires a huge extrapolation to fainter magnitudes .    using the current best constraints on the qso luminosity function",
    "@xcite we expect 1 - 2 qsos at @xmath56 in the full video survey ; we will therefore be able to provide constraints on the faint end of the qso luminosity function at @xmath57 , a factor of 10 improvement in the number density of qsos over narrower and deeper surveys such as ultravista and the ukidss - uds .      with the video survey data we can also find lower - redshift qsos which are faint and/or reddened .",
    "however , interesting constraints could also be made on the obscured agn population when the video survey data are combined with _ spitzer _",
    "( e.g. swire and servs ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the depth of video is crucial in determining the nature of distant obscured agn .",
    "although the central quasar is obscured in these objects , video will have the sensitivity to detect the host galaxies of such sources up to @xmath58 assuming that their host galaxies are @xmath59 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 12  degree@xmath60 covered by video will ensure that the rarest and most luminous agn are found and investigated in terms of their host galaxy properties and comoving space density .",
    "for example , adopting the study of heavily obscured agn from @xcite we expect to find @xmath61 heavily obscured qsos at @xmath62 in the video survey .",
    "this would then allow the study of the range of host galaxy masses and the environmental density of these objects , something that would be severely restricted with cosmos and ultravista , and almost impossible with candels , due to the rarity of these luminous agn .",
    "therefore , video is uniquely placed to probe the cosmic evolution of all agn , both obscured and unobscured and address the question of downsizing in the agn population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are several outstanding challenges to progress in type ia supernova",
    "( sn ia ) cosmology @xcite .",
    "the most important include : i ) improved precision in the photometric calibration , ii ) understanding sn ia physics , particularly the sn `` colour laws '' and the role of the progenitor system , iii ) constructing comprehensive low - redshift surveys to anchor cosmological analyses , and iv ) building the first homogeneous samples of sn  ia at @xmath51 .",
    "near - infrared observations are an essential tool to exploring these trends further ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as well as verifying the extinction corrections made in the optical , theoretical sn ia models suggest that the intrinsic peak brightness dispersion could be substantially smaller at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "observational studies using @xmath4 , @xmath5 photometry at @xmath63 show some evidence for this , indicating that sne ia are equally good standard candles at these wavelengths ( peak dispersion @xmath64mag ) and , have no apparent correlation with optical light curve post - peak decline rate @xcite .",
    "indeed , the combination of optical and near - ir data could provide the strongest constraints on the optical extinction , enabling a substantial improvement in sn ia extinction corrections at all wavelengths .",
    "further , as outlined by @xcite , near - ir light curves offer insight into several key aspects of sn ia physics .",
    "the distinctive light curve morphology is sensitive to both the amount and radial distribution of iron group elements ( radioactive and stable ) synthesised in the explosion .",
    "these in turn reflect the nature of the explosion process and the progenitor star system , including the white dwarf metallicity .",
    "studies at near - ir wavelengths thus offer an exciting opportunity to further understand and improve upon our dust corrections of sne ia and the near - infrared light curves .",
    "the video fields are key fields within the dark energy survey ( des ) supernova survey @xcite and will be able to provide near - infrared data points on the light curves of supernovae discovered in the des supernova survey . furthermore , the spectral energy distribution fitting and photometric redshift accuracy of the supernovae host galaxies , which now play a key role in the cosmological analyses @xcite , will improve substantially when the optical des data are used in conjunction with the deep video near - infrared data , and aid in the determination of host galaxy stellar masses @xcite .",
    "the video survey is being carried out over three of the most widely observed high - galactic - latitude fields , these are two vista tiles ( @xmath65  degree@xmath60 ) in the elais - s1 field , three vista ( @xmath66  degree@xmath60 ) tiles in the xmm - newton large scale structure field , and another three tiles in the extended chandra deep field south , covering a total area of @xmath67  degree@xmath60 .",

    "<S> in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) deep extragalactic observations ( video ) survey . </S>",
    "<S> video is a @xmath0  degree@xmath1 survey in the near - infrared @xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and large structures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from the present day out to z=4 , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the most massive galaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization . with its depth and area </S>",
    "<S> , video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn and starburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters were beginning to virialize . </S>",
    "<S> video therefore offers a unique data set with which to investigate the interplay between agn , starbursts and environment , and the role of feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide data over the video - xmm3 tile , which also covers the canada - france - hawaii - telescope legacy survey deep-1 field ( cfhtls - d1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the released video data reach a @xmath7 ab - magnitude depth of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 in 2  arcsec diameter apertures ( the full depth of @xmath13 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find good astrometric agreement with the two - micron all sky survey , and source counts in agreement with the recently released ultravista survey data . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the video data to the cfhtls - d1 optical data increases the accuracy of photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic outliers over the redshift range @xmath14 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absence of an @xmath15band luminosity prior . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect the main improvement in photometric redshifts will come in the redshift range @xmath16 due to the sensitivity to the balmer and 4000 breaks provided by the near - infrared vista filters . </S>",
    "<S> all images and catalogues presented in this paper are publicly available through eso s `` phase 3 '' archive and the vista science archive .    </S>",
    "<S> observations : galaxies - general - astronomical data bases : surveys : cosmology : large - scale structure of universe </S>"
