    ", it has been found that phase and amplitude wave engineering is of crucial importance for subwavelength focusing of waves@xcite . in the case of pulsed waves ,",
    "the situation is more complex , mainly due to the fact that the superposition of many spectral components in most cases tend to broaden the focal spot .",
    "theoretically , one may hope to be able to focus strongly confined pulses as in ref .",

    "well developed theories and numerical algorithms are available for studying monochromatic and polychromatic waves in focal regions@xcite , but they do not provide direct insight into the reverse engineering problem and may not provide a fast solution or be optimal with the minimal amount of information given . of particular interest here is the emerging field of evanescent wave focusing , where up to now mainly monochromatic waves have been studied@xcite",
    ". however , also for waves containing several frequency components it is necessary to have straightforward methods which allow backtracking of the signal in a manner such that the initial field resulting in a strong focus is found . in the present work we detail a method for finding the intensity distribution near the focal region using phase and amplitude compensation . in order to achieve this goal",
    ", we pinpoint a certain distribution at focus and then try to calculate the required aperture field .",
    "moreover , we show an analogy between our compensation method and the transformation of frequencies between inertial , relativistic coordinate systems .",
    "the method of phase and amplitude compensation has been described in a number of studies ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) , but was more recently re - introduced to study focusing of evanescent waves@xcite .",
    "the procedure is most easily demonstrated for scalar monochromatic waves satisfying the helmholtz equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wavenumber , @xmath2 is the angular frequency and @xmath3 is the velocity of light in the medium under consideration . using the angular spectrum representation ,",
    "the field can be written as @xmath4 where the angular spectrum is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 here @xmath7 represent the homogenous plane waves , whereas @xmath8 correspond to inhomogeneous or evanescent plane waves that propagate in the @xmath9 direction and decay in the z - direction .",
    "the trick is now to express the angular spectrum as @xmath10 where we must again require @xmath11 to be bandlimited ( i.e. nonzero only in a range @xmath12 ) and converges sufficiently quickly such that the solution for the field does not possess any unphysical divergency problem .",
    "the conditions for this was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the field at the focal point ( @xmath13 ) is now given by @xmath14 i.e. a fourier transform of the aperture function @xmath15 resulting in a finite resolution at the focal point .",
    "as an example , assume now that @xmath16 for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and zero elsewhere .",
    "then we have @xmath19 in order to find the field @xmath20 we must evaluate @xmath21 in ref.@xcite it was found that in the case of paraxial waves ( @xmath22 ) the field @xmath20 is approximately a quadratic phase function , which has been described in detail in standard textbooks on optics@xcite .",
    "thus , in the paraxial approximation the phase compensation method directly leads us to the well - known phase profile for a lens giving the most strongly focused profile@xcite .",
    "recently , the phase compensation method has been used to design evanescent waves in focal regions@xcite . the simplest wave profile exhibiting a focal region",
    "is found by letting @xmath23 if @xmath12 and zero elsewhere .",

    "\\label{perf}\\ ] ] the intensity at the focus is therefore just @xmath27 whereas the aperture field oscillates rapidly within an envelope such that the intensity is @xmath28 . notice that the aperture field is much stronger than the field in the focal region , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "however , we also see that the intensity distribution is more confined at the focal region than anywhere else . in fig . [",
    "f1](a ) the intensity of a monochromatic , evanescent wave is displayed with @xmath30 ( arbitrary units ) , @xmath31 ( arbitrary units ) and @xmath32 . the solid line shows the field in focus , whereas the dashed line shows the fields at @xmath33 .",
    "this illustrates our point , namely that we may obtain a more spatially confined intensity distribution ( although the magnitude is considerably smaller than that at the aperture ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath34 , a possible criterium for focusing could be obtained by requiring that the aperture intensity ( at @xmath13 ) envelope at @xmath35 , corresponding to the position with half the maximum intensity , should be wider than the focused intensity distribution of half - width @xmath36 .",
    "thus , by requiring @xmath37 , we ensure that the field is focused . at the same time",
    ", the field should not diverge at the aperture , and it is clear that @xmath38 can not be too large .",
    "interestingly , the compensation method described above is not limited to designing waves in focal regions described by the helmholtz equation .",
    "it can also be used to construct solutions to other differential equations , such as the diffusion equation , and we will here look at one example .",
    "imagine that we generate a spatial magnetic field distribution by positioning a system of co - aligned current - carrying wires in a homogeneous medium of frequency - independent conductivity @xmath39 and permittivity @xmath40 .",
    "each of the wires carry a low frequency current where the frequencies of any temporal waveform fulfills @xmath41 . in absence of sources",
    "the resulting electric ( or magnetic ) field can be described by the diffusion equation on the form@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "we now want to describe the field in the vicinity of the wires , but not including any sources such that eq .",
    "[ adiff ] is valid .",
    "the field can then be written on the following general form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fourier amplitude .",

    "[ hhh ] will represent a diffusion process where the field delocalizes with increasing time@xcite .",
    "however , we are here interested in finding a field @xmath20 with an optimally localized field @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . to see how one may design such an initial field ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath48 is a constant for @xmath49 and zero for @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the field is given by @xmath51 the real value of eq .",
    "[ hh1 ] at @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 whereas at @xmath54 it is @xmath55 by selecting @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , we see that the leading contribution to @xmath58 , which is an oscillatory function with period @xmath59 .",

    ", @xmath46 is strongly localized with a central lobe @xmath60 , but is a factor @xmath61 smaller than the field at @xmath52 . a sharp localization is therefore obtained at the expense of an exponential reduction in field amplitude .",
    "this is rather similar to the behavior we observe for monochromatic evanescent waves , although the details are different .",
    "in addition to describing electromagnetic fields , the diffusion equation may also describe concentration or temperature ( but now with a different diffusion coefficient ) . in those cases",
    "it should be mentioned that we do not consider absolute temperature or concentrations ( as required by our boundary conditions ) , but rather modulations about an equilibrium .",
    "thus , the negative values seen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] b ) do not mean absolute negative temperature and concentration , they are just signatures of the variations about the mean temperature or concentration seen when designing an initial profile required to bring the diffusive waves to a focus .",
    "an interesting question is whether the method above can be applied directly to polychromatic waves ( e.g. pulsed waves ) satisfying the wave equation @xmath62 in the angular spectrum representation , the field can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65    in order to bring the polychromatic waves to focus we require cross - compensation of the phase , which amounts to setting @xmath66 , i.e. the spatial part of the phase is compensated by the temporal part at @xmath67 .",
    "such a requirement can only be fulfilled if @xmath2 depends on the spatial frequencies ( i.e. direction of each plane wave ) , where the angular frequency is given by @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the fact that the frequency of the spatial wave vector depends on the direction was utilized in ref . @xcite to combine a rainbow spectrum to a single , focused spot .",
    "conceptually the idea presented here is somewhat similar , although we use an entirely different approach to achieve the goal .",
    "note that we must distinguish between the two cases @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the case @xmath71 results in superluminal , localized waveforms which have been discussed extensively in the literature@xcite . here",

[ e ] from an entirely different perspective based on requirement of specific field profile resulting from phase compensation .    of greater interest in the current study is the case @xmath72 , since that represents an evanescent wave solution similar to that seen in the previous section .",
    "now @xmath77 is purely imaginary , such that @xmath78 as an example , we may approximate the angular spectrum as @xmath79 for @xmath80 and zero elsewhere . here",
    "we also assume that @xmath24 , such that only evanescent waves are excited with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "[ evantime ] is identical to eq.[perf ] if we set @xmath85 , and is therefore just a translation of the evanescent wave along the optical axis with the intensity distribution similar to that of fig .",
    "since we require @xmath86 , which is fulfilled if we , as an example , set @xmath87 , the half - width of the intensity distribution at the traveling focal line is narrower than @xmath88 .",
    "the intensity at @xmath33 grows as @xmath89 .",
    "however , when @xmath90 our approximate theory for evanescent waves does not longer hold in the vicinity of @xmath33 ( this follows from the considerations above ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion about diverging solutions ) .",
    "the fact that the evanescent wave does not change at the focal line @xmath91 is surprising , given the condition @xmath92 above .",

    "the technical implementation of focusing of polychromatic waves is in effect similar to that of monochromatic waves , but with two new important features : a ) the focusing must take place in a spatially dispersive media , and b ) the field at the aperture must grow with time ( within the approximation given above ) .    an interesting analogy occurs if one compares the problem of designing an aperture field that generate optimal focus with that of transformation of frequencies between inertial , relativistic coordinate systems@xcite . to see this , consider a plane wave of the form @xmath94 .",
    "any wavepacket is a weighted sum over such plane waves in spatial and frequency coordinates . in order to bring the wave packet to focus",

    "this can be done by setting @xmath97 , such that the phase is exactly compensated at @xmath98 .",
    "it should be noted , as seen above , that such a requirement may give rise to strong localization at other positions as well . in any case , such a cross - compensation requirement can only be fulfilled if @xmath2 depends on the spatial frequencies ( i.e. direction of each plane wave ) , where the frequency is given by @xmath99 \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{k_x z_1 } { \\phi ( k_x ) } \\right ) ^{2 } -1 \\right ] } \\,\\,\\ , .",
