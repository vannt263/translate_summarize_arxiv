    "ferromagnetism and superconductivity are antagonistic to each other s orders , however their interplay can be realized when the two interactions are spatially separated . in this case",
    "the coexistence of the two orderings is due to the proximity effect @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "experimentally this situation can be realized in superconductor/ ferromagnet ( s / f ) hybrid structures .",
    "the role of the andreev reflection is central to the proximity effect since it provides the mechanism for converting single electron states from a normal ( n ) or ferromagnetic metal to cooper pairs in the superconducting condensate @xcite , @xcite . during the andreev reflection process",
    "the electron incoming to the n / s ( f / s ) interface is reflected as a hole and a charge @xmath4 is transferred across the interface . as a result",
    "a long - range electron - hole coherence is induced into the non - superconducting material .",
    "the andreev reflection manifests itself in the subgap conductance , i.e. the conductance for voltages smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath1 . in diffusive n / s systems",
    "the subgap conductance shows the zero bias anomaly peak due to the impurity confinement and the electron - hole interference at the fermi level @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    at a s / f interface the mechanism of andreev reflection",
    "is modified compared to the n / s hybrid structures since the incoming electron and reflected hole belong to different spin bands @xcite .",
    "thus , one expects a suppression of the andreev ( subgap ) current by increasing the exchange field @xmath0 , which is a measure of the spin - splitting at the fermi level .",
    "recently it was shown by the authors that this intuitive picture does not hold always @xcite . if the voltage exceeds some critical value the andreev current of a tunnel ferromagnet/ insulator/ superconductor ( fis ) structure is enhanced by a small exchange field @xmath5 reaching a maximum at @xmath6 at zero temperature .",
    "if one keeps the voltage low but now increase the temperature , the andreev current ( as well as the full current at this temperature ) shows a peak at @xmath2 .",
    "all these novel features were exhaustively discussed in @xcite . finally it was shown that the subgap conductance of a fis junction at low temperatures and small exchange fields @xmath5 has a peak at @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus its measurement can be used to determine the strength of a weak exchange or zeeman - like field in the hybrid structure .",
    "the latter can be not only the intrinsic exchange field of a ferromagnetic alloy @xcite but also a spin - splitting field created in the normal metal by a magnetic induction @xmath7 ( in which case @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bohr magneton ) or by a proximity to the ferromagnetic insulator material @xcite .",
    "all these predictions were made in @xcite for the mono - domain fis hybrid system .",
    "the purpose of this work is to consider hybrid structure with a multi - domain ferromagnetic metal .",
    "we present a quantitative analysis of the electron transport in fis tunnel structures where a ferromagnetic layer consist of two magnetic domains with arbitrary direction of magnetization ( so called `` superconducting spin - valve '' @xcite ) .",
    "we show that in this case the aforementioned features of the andreev current and subgap conductance occur at the value of the `` effective field '' , which is the field acting on the cooper pairs in the multi - domain ferromagnetic region , averaged over the decay length of the superconducting condensate into a ferromagnet @xcite .",

    "we consider the diffusive limit , i.e the elastic scattering length @xmath14 is much smaller than the decay length of the superconducting condensate into a ferromagnet @xmath15 and the superconducting coherence length @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath0 is the value of the exchange field ( we set @xmath18 and for simplicity we assume the same @xmath17 in the whole structure ) .",
    "we also assume that the f@xmath10f@xmath11 and f@xmath11n interfaces are transparent , while the sf@xmath10 is a tunnel barrier .",
    "thus , the two ferromagnetic layers are kept at the same potential as the voltage - biased normal reservoir .",

    "first we briefly review the novel features of the andreev current for a mono - domain sifn structure ( @xmath90 ) , discussed in @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "we observe the enhancement of the andreev current at high enough voltages above some critical value , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , solid black line . the andreev current first increases by increasing @xmath0 , reaches a maximum at @xmath6 , and then decays by further increase of the exchange field .",
    "the enhancement of the andreev current is due to the competition between two - particle tunneling processes and decoherence mechanisms .",
    "sharp suppression of the andreev current at @xmath6 occurs when the electron - hole coherence length @xmath91 is cut off by the decay length of superconducting condensate into a ferromagnet , @xmath15 .",
    "another feature of the andreev current , predicted in @xcite is the peak at @xmath2 which can be observed only at finite temperatures .",
    "the relative height of this peak increases with temperature and voltage , see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , solid black line . in case of large enough values of @xmath92 and @xmath62 ,",
    "we observe both the enhancement of the andreev current by increasing @xmath0 and the peak at @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) , solid black line .",

    "( [ ia ] ) is @xmath1 ( at zero temperature the upper limit is @xmath93 ) . then the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ ia ] ) has a `` dangerous point '' at @xmath94 .",
    "this peak can be observed by measuring the full electric current through the junction as the single particle current is almost independent on @xmath0 .",
    "note that for the values of temperature used in our calculations @xmath95 .",
    "now let us reconsider these features for the two - domain situation in case of @xmath96 ( dashed blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and @xmath97 ( dash - dotted red line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the thickness of the f layers is chosen to be @xmath98 and",
    "@xmath99 , @xmath100 short enough for the superconducting condensate penetrates both ferromagnetic layers and @xmath101 long enough for the full development of the proximity effect in f@xmath10f@xmath11 bilayer ( at small values of @xmath101 the andreev current is suppressed by the proximity of the normal reservoir at @xmath102 ) @xcite .",
    "firs of all , we see that increasing @xmath20 the features ( peaks at @xmath103 ) smear and their amplitude reduces .",
    "for @xmath97 we do not see any more the enhancement of the andreev current . secondly , we see shift of these peaks to the larger values of @xmath0 , which is explicitly seen for @xmath96 .",
    "the peak at @xmath6 is shifted to the right ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , dashed blue line ) as well as the peak at @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) , dashed blue line ) .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "the superconducting condensate penetrates both ferromagnetic layers and feel the `` effective exchange field '' @xmath104 acting on the cooper pairs , averaged over the length @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath106 is gradually reduced as @xmath20 increases from @xmath107 to @xmath24 . as before the andreev current peak is at @xmath108 which in the case of a finite @xmath20 corresponds to larger values of the bare @xmath0 , therefore we observe shift of the andreev current peak to the right .",
    "let us now calculate the subgap differential conductance @xmath109 at zero temperature .",
    "it is known that for a diffusive nis junction the differential conductance at low temperatures has a peak at @xmath110 and a zero bias anomaly ( zba ) peak due to the impurity confinement and the electron - hole interference at the fermi level @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it occurs at zero bias since for @xmath111 the electron is perfectly retro - reflected as a hole during the andreev reflection process .",
    "thus the electron and the reflected hole interfere along the same trajectory and the interference effect strongly enhance the subgap conductance at zero bias @xcite .    for the fis structures with @xmath5 the zba peak",
    "is now shifted to the finite voltage @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , solid black lines .",
    "this can be described as follows . upon entering of the cooper pair into the ferromagnetic metal the spin up electron in the pair lowers its potential energy by @xmath0 , while the spin down electron raises its potential energy by the same amount . in order for each electron to conserve its total energy , the spin up electron must increase its kinetic energy , while the spin down electron must decrease its kinetic energy , to make up for these additional potential energies in f @xcite .",
    "therefore the electron - hole pair in f has now the momentum mismatch , i.e. the electron is not perfectly retro - reflected .",
    "however , if @xmath3 there is a possibility for exact retro - reflection ( and interference along the trajectory ) of an electron to a hole with a same kinetic energy equal to the fermi energy .",
    "in case of the two - domain ferromagnetic metal we now have the zba shift to the `` effective exchange field '' @xmath112 .",
    "the `` effective field '' is smaller than the bare @xmath0 , @xmath113 , and therefore we observe the shift of the differential conductance peak to the left .",
    "we can explicitly see this for @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , dashed blue lines ) .",
    "for @xmath97 the situation is more complicated as the effective exchange field is rather small in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "for @xmath98 we observe a broad zba peak at @xmath111 for @xmath97 for both values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , dash - dotted red lines ) . for @xmath116",
    "the maximum is shifted from the zero bias , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , dash - dotted red lines .    in the end",
    "we notice that siffn structures with two - domain ferromagnetic interlayer show interesting behavior of the heat current through the structure @xcite .",
    "it is known that in nis tunnel junctions the flow of electric current is accompanied by a heat transfer from the normal metal into the superconductor @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this happens due to the selective tunneling of high - energy quasiparticles out of the normal metal in presence of the superconducting energy gap @xmath1 .",
    "the heat transfer through nis junctions can be used for the realization of a microcooler , and the important problem is to overcome possible limitations of its cooling performance .",
    "some of the limitations arise from the fact that nonequilibrium quasiparticles injected into the superconducting electrode accumulate near the tunneling interface @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved by imposing a local thermal equilibrium in the superconductor electrode by means of a `` quasiparticle trap '' , i.e. an additional normal metal layer covering the superconductor electrode @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another fundamental limitation arise from the andreev reflection processes : the andreev current @xmath117 does not transfer heat through the n / s interface but rather generates the joule heating @xmath118 which fully dissipates in the normal electrode and dominates quasiparticle cooling at low temperatures @xcite , @xcite . in order to reduce this factor it was proposed to add a ferromagnetic interlayer in the nis structure to suppress the andreev current and enhance the heat current and cooling performance @xcite .    from our studies we can conclude that the ferromagnetic interlayer with small enough exchange field will rather enhance the andreev current and suppress the heat current ( cooling power ) through the structure .",
    "one need ferromagnet with an exchange field ( bare or effective in multi - domain case ) larger than the superconductor gap @xmath1 to suppress the andreev reflection processes and enhance the cooling performance .",
    "the @xmath20-dependence of the heat current in siffn structures was discussed in @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the andreev current and the subgap conductance behavior in siffn hybrid structures with arbitrary direction of magnetization of the f layers .",
    "we have revisited all novel features predicted recently in the mono - domain sif system in the presence of a small spin - splitting field @xmath0 @xcite , namely the andreev current peaks at @xmath6 at @xmath119 and at @xmath2 for high enough temperature , and the differential conductance peak at @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown that in the two - domain case the aforementioned features occur at the value of the `` effective exchange field '' @xmath113 , which is the field acting on the cooper pairs in the multi - domain ferromagnetic region , averaged over the decay length of the superconducting condensate into a ferromagnet , @xmath105 .",
    "increasing @xmath20 from @xmath107 to @xmath24 one gradually reduce the effective field @xmath106 .",
