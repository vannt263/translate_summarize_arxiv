    "the measurement of [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios of globular clusters provides important information regarding relative ages .",
    "the @xmath3-elements ( c , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti ) are synthesized predominantly by massive stars , and ejected into the interstellar medium by type ii supernovae ( sne  ii ) explosions . on the other hand ,",
    "iron - peak elements are produced by both sne  ii and type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "enhanced values of [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios in globular clusters indicate the domination of sne  ii nucleosynthesis , while lower ratios indicate increasing contribution of sne  ia , which are thought to appear 10@xmath4 or more years later .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the behavior of [ @xmath3/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] tells us how rapidly chemical enrichment proceeded in our galaxy ( wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) .",
    "the [ @xmath3/fe ] ratio is also important in deriving accurate age from comparisons of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to model isochrones .",
    "[ @xmath3/fe ] ratios also provide a means of diagnosing the initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) parameters ( mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "an imf skewed to high - mass stars would have a higher @xmath3-element yield while a high sfr would give an enhanced [ @xmath3/fe ] at a higher [ fe / h ] since the interstellar medium will reach higher [ fe / h ] before the onset of sne  ia contributions .",
    "in the recent study of three metal - poor inner old halo globular clusters ( zinn 1993 , da costa & armandroff 1995 ) , ngc  6287 , ngc  6293 , and ngc  6541 , lee & carney ( 2002b ) claimed that [ si / ti ] ratios are anticorrelated with galactocentric distance of the  old \" halo globular clusters , in the sense that the silicon abundance increases and the titanium abundance decreases with galactocentric distances , and they proposed that the masses of sne  ii progenitors may have been responsible for this elemental abundance gradient .",
    "however , the impact of the skewed imf of sne  ii progenitors in metal - rich globular clusters @xmath3-element abundances appears to be unclear as yet mainly due to the lack of study of metal - rich clusters .",
    "thus more chemical abundance studies of metal - rich globular clusters near the galactic center are necessary , since the most metal - rich globular clusters are concentrated in the galaxy s central regions .    palomar  6 is known to be a metal - rich globular cluster located 0.9 kpc from the galactic center . as lee & carney ( 2002a ) discussed , the metallicity of palomar  6 has been in controversy for two decades . malkan ( 1981 )",
    "was the first to estimate the metallicity of palomar  6 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath21.30 , using a reddening - free metallicity index @xmath5 , ranking it a metal poor inner halo cluster .",
    "zinn ( 1985 ) derived [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.74 for palomar  6 by reanalyzing malkan s photometry .",

    "1995 ) estimated [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xmath20.4 based on the ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) - cmd . the results of minniti ( 1995b ) and bica et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are worth noting .",
    "minniti ( 1995b ) studied the metallicities of seven highly reddened clusters near the galactic center including palomar  6 .",
    "he obtained low s / n ratio spectra of six red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars with 2   resolution covering @xmath9 4700 - 5400  .",
    "he suggested that the sum of mg @xmath10 5175  , fe @xmath10 5270  , and fe @xmath10 5535   lines ( mg + 2fe ) is the optimal indicator of metallicity following faber et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and minniti derived [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 @xmath0 0.3 for palomar  6 based on the location of the giants in the ( mg + 2fe ) versus @xmath11 diagram ( see his figure  1 ) .",
    "more recently , bica et al .  ( 1998 ) undertook a metallicity study of the globular clusters near the galactic center with an expanded sample .",
    "they measured the ca  ii triplet @xmath9 8498 , 8542 , and 8662   using intermediate resolution ( 5.4   pixel@xmath1 ) integrated spectra and obtained [ @xmath12 = @xmath20.09 for palomar  6 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the result of bica et al .",
    "( 1998 ) may have a potential problem with field star contamination , since palomar  6 lies in the galactic center and the field star contamination is expected to be very high ( see , for example , figure  8 of lee & carney 2002a ) .",
    "the abundance study of galactic bulge giants showed that the mean [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.25 ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) , which is comparable to that of bica et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found for stars in or near palomar  6 .",
    "also the metallicity estimates relying on low resolution spectra can give erroneous results in the metal - rich rgb stars due to blending with some of the notorious molecular bands , such as tio ( see , for example , plez 1998 ) and cn ( see , for example , mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) .",
    "mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) have demonstrated the effect of the cn blending in the metal - rich bulge k giants in their figure  7 .",
    "they claimed that the cn blending may cause a discrepancy in metallicity by @xmath6 0.3 dex between the results of mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) , who employed high resolution spectroscopy , and those of rich ( 1988 ) , who employed a similar method as minniti ( 1995 ) .",
    "recently , stephens & frogel ( 2004 ) employed medium - resolution ( @xmath13 = 1380  1650 ) infrared ( ir ) @xmath14-band spectroscopy for 8 globular clusters near the galactic center .",
    "they measured na  i doublet ( @xmath9 21910 ",
    "21966 ) , ca  i triplet ( @xmath9 22450  22560 ) , co(2,0 ) band ( @xmath9 22915  23025 ) and obtained [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.52 @xmath0 0.11 for palomar  6 .",
    "comparisons of high resolution spectra of cool stars of wallace & hinkle ( 1996 ) with the spectral regions used by stephens & frogel ( 2004 ) show that their spectral regions are vulnerable to contamination from the cn blending and their results may have problems similar to those of rich ( 1988 ) .",

    "all of our observations were obtained with a 0.5 arcsec slit , providing a nominal resolution of 42,000 , or 7 km sec@xmath1 , using a  nodding \" mode , which moves the telescope between frames and stores each frame separately . because of the limited spectral coverage in a single grating setting , it was necessary to choose particular grating settings to cover spectral features of special interest .",
    "we chose two spectral regions based on the ir atlas of arcturus ( hinkle et al .",
    "one setting is for the two fe  i lines ( centered at @xmath6 @xmath10 22395  ) and the other is for the two si  i lines and a ti  i line ( centered at @xmath6 @xmath10 21815  ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that our spectral regions are free of molecular lines , such as cn or co. both spectral regions contain the neutral scandium lines , however , we do not derive the scandium abundance due to the lack of information of the hyperfine splitting of the sc  i lines .",
    "the basic photometric data for our targets using star ids of minniti ( 1995b ) are given in table  1 and the finding chart is given in figure  1 .",
    "note that we adopt @xmath18 photometry by lee & carney ( 2002a ) in the table .",
    "we also obtained spectra for the @xmath19co 2 - 0 bandhead for each target and for arcturus to measure the radial velocity .",
    "this was necessary , as noted above , since field contamination toward palomar  6 is expected to be high due to its low galactic latitude .",
    "once we confirmed probable cluster membership using the velocities for each target ( see section 3.1 ) , we obtained useful spectra for stars a , d , and g. we also obtained spectra of rapidly rotating early type stars in order to remove telluric absorption features .",
    "the journal of observations is summarized in table  2 .",
    "the raw data reductions were performed following the similar procedures described by carr , sellgren , & balachandran ( 2000 ) . in nodding mode ,",
    "the data are stored with  a \" or  b \" name extensions to indicate beam polarity . subtraction of these a - beam and b - beam images removed dark current , residual images on the array , and any thermal or night sky line emission .",
    "the beam images were combined together separately .",
    "the residuals of the cosmic ray hit events on these combined images were removed by eye using the iraf task imedit , and then the spectrum was extracted using the iraf task apall .",
    "separate dispersion solutions were determined for the two beams before combining them into one spectrum .",
    "the same procedures were done for hot star spectra and then the hot star spectra were divided into the target spectra to correct for telluric absorption lines and for fringing in the spectra .",
    "the target spectra were then continuum fitted and normalized .",
    "in figure  2 , we show spectra of arcturus and our targets in palomar  6 for the @xmath19co 2 - 0 bandhead centered at @xmath6 @xmath10 22945  . in order to derive the heliocentric radial velocities ,",

    "we believe that minniti ( 1995b ) misidentified star f as a cluster member since the radial velocity of this star is not consistent with cluster membership .",
    "an independent check of the radial velocity for palomar  6 remains desirable .",
    "however , in this paper we consider our velocity measurements are correct and stars a , c , d , and g are cluster members .",
    "our mean heliocentric velocity of palomar  6 is + 180.6 @xmath0 3.2 km sec@xmath1 and is 20 km sec@xmath1 smaller than that of minniti ( 1995b ) .",
    "( the error is that of the mean and is affected by both our measurement uncertainties and by the cluster s internal velocity dispersion . )",
    "laboratory measurements of the oscillator strengths for the lines in our spectral regions do not exist .",
    "therefore , we derived the oscillator strengths following the procedure described by carr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which exploits the known abundances and stellar atmospheric parameters for both the sun and for arcturus .",
    "we used kurucz s solar atmosphere model with @xmath21 = 1.0 km  s@xmath1 and adopted @xmath22 = 4300 k , @xmath23 = 1.5 , and @xmath21 = 1.7 km  s@xmath1 for arcturus ( peterson et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "we first measured the equivalent widths of the absorption lines from the solar intensity spectrum ( wallace et al .",

    "it is suspected that the collisional damping constant calculated using the unsld approximation is probably too small ( e.g. steffen 1985 ) , so we artificially increased the collisional damping constants by matching the synthetic spectrum to the solar intensity spectrum of wallace et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . to calculate the synthetic solar spectrum",
    ", we use the macroturbulent velocity of 3.0 km  s@xmath1 for the sun ( gray 1977 ) and the solar elemental abundances of anders & greevesse ( 1989 ) . the synthetic spectra with no enhancement in the collisional damping constant fail to match the line core depth and the line wing profile in particular for iron lines .",
    "thus we enhanced the collisional damping constant by a factor of 3.5 for the iron lines and by a factor of 2 for the silicon and titanium lines .",
    "we show the synthetic solar spectra in figure  3 and our solar oscillator strengths in table  4 .",
    "note that our fe  i oscillator strengths are slightly different from those of carr et al .",

    "our solar oscillator strength for ti  i @xmath10 21788.63 is rather uncertain , since it is on the wing profile of the nearby si  i @xmath10 21785.60  , which has a strong wing profile in the solar spectrum . in the figure , it is evident that the solar intensity spectrum shows subtle line asymmetries , in particular for iron lines , probably caused by the doppler shift due to the convective and oscillatory motions in the solar atmosphere , which can not be reproduced by the plane - parallel one dimensional model atmosphere ( asplund 2003 ) .",
    "a comparison with an arcturus spectrum provides a crucial opportunity to examine the reliability of our solar oscillator strengths , since the chemical composition and the stellar parameters of arcturus are closer to those of our target rgb stars than those of the sun and a high resolution , high s / n ratio spectrum is also available for arcturus ( hinkle et al .",

    "contrary to the recent results using low resolution spectroscopy , our results have shown that palomar  6 has an intermediate metallicity with [ fe / h ] = @xmath21.0 @xmath0 0.1 and is slightly more metal - poor than m71 .",
    "our estimated uncertainties in the surface temperatures , gravities , and microturbulent velocities for the three stars we have studied will not affect our derived [ fe / h ] value by more than 0.2 dex .",

    "<S> contrary to the previous metallicity estimates using low - resolution spectroscopy , our results show that palomar  6 has an intermediate metallicity with [ fe / h ] = @xmath21.0 @xmath0 0.1 and is slightly more metal - poor than m71 . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable changes in the surface temperature or the microturbulent velocity of the model atmospheres do not affect [ fe / h ] at more than @xmath0 0.2  dex . in spite of its high metallicity , based on the spectrum of a single cluster member the [ si / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ratios of palomar  6 appear to be enhanced by 0.4  dex and 0.5  dex , respectively , suggesting that the galactic inner halo may have experienced a very rapid chemical enrichment history . </S>"
