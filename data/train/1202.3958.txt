    "for convenience reasons , we write @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "we also write @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite .",
    "it is completely independent from the first , and also mostly independent from the second paper , apart from the ( @xcite , section 4 , steps i and iii ) , which are crucial for the current work .",
    "the main needed steps will be summarized here in the subsection [ sub - quadratic ] .",
    "the current paper is an introduction to the prospective paper @xcite where general plane vector fields are treated in the framework of quasi - rational flows ; see the subsection [ sub - qf ] .",
    "the general  affine \" translation equation is a functional equation of the type @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "note that this is not the most general form of the translation equation ; to get the feeling of the variety of structure and methods that underlies this equation , the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "our research concentrates on the special case of this equation , where @xmath15 is of the form @xmath16 ; this choice is not accidental , since it exhibits several fascinating features not encountered in the general affine solutions (  affine flows \" ) .",
    "this special case was first introduced in @xcite where we considered the @xmath1-dimensional equation from the topologic point of view in the simplest case of the sphere @xmath17 .",
    "+ in the paper @xcite we solved the following problem : find all rational solutions of the @xmath1-dimensional projective translation equation ( prte for short ) @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a pair of rational functions in two real or complex variables .",
    "it appears that , up to conjugation with a @xmath6-homogenic birational plane transformation ( @xmath6-bir in short , for the structure of these see the appendix in @xcite ) , all rational solutions of this equation are as follows : the zero flow @xmath20 , two singular flows @xmath21 and @xmath22 , an identity flow @xmath23 , and one non - singular flow for each non - negative integer @xmath5 , called _ the level _ of the flow ; this solution is given by @xmath24 below .",
    "the non - singular solution of this equation is called _ the projective flow_. _ non - singularity _ means that a flow satisfies the boundary condition @xmath25 thus , each rational projective flow @xmath26 is automatically a birational plane transformation whose inverse is given by @xmath27 .",
    "+ the main object associated with a solution is its _ vector field _",
    "given by @xmath28 vector field is necessarily a pair of @xmath1-homogenic functions . for smooth functions ,",
    "the functional equation ( [ funkk ] ) implies the pde @xmath29 and the same pde for @xmath30 , with boundary conditions @xmath31 in principle , the pde ( [ g - parteq ] ) with the above boundary conditions is equivalent to ( [ funkk ] ) ; but the proof of this equivalence is possible only in each case separately , since there arises the complication to determine the definition domain of the flow - for example , explore @xmath32 below .",
    "thus , not all functions in two complex variables can be iterated without restrictions - this restriction is explicitly present in ( [ funkk ] ) , but only implicitly present in ( [ g - parteq ] ) , and only _ a posteriori _ , after we have found the solution , whether in analytic form in terms of known special functions , or via an independent analysis .",
    "+ each point under a flow possesses the orbit , which is either a curve ( when we deal with flows over @xmath33 ) or a surface ( complex curve over @xmath34 ) , or a single point ; the orbit is defined by @xmath35 for rational flows of level @xmath5 , there exists an @xmath5th degree homogenic rational function @xmath36 such that the orbits are the curves @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "we will also refer to non - rational flows as also being of level @xmath5 if the orbits are given by @xmath5th degree homogeneous rational function .",
    "it appears that the vector field of a rational flow is a pair of @xmath1-homogenic rational functions .",
    "the main theorem in @xcite gives the first structural result for the rational flows ; many more properties of the flows which take into account not only the level but the birational conjugation itself will be treated in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the proof ( which is rather lengthy ) is that using conjugation with @xmath6-bir , the vector field can be reduced step by step , leading to rational @xmath1-homogenic functions with numerators of smaller degree , and eventually , provided we do not encounter an obstruction , to quadratic forms .",
    "the obstruction arises when we hit the vector field whose both coordinates are proportional .",
    "so , we are left to find all rational flows whose vector field is given by a pair of two quadratic forms in two variables , or whose one of the coordinates vanish ( this is equivalent , after a linear conjugation , to the obstruction ) .",
    "the first case is a rewarding part of the proof .",
    "for example , we find that some of these pairs of quadratic forms lead to rational solutions , while others should be discarded since they arise from non - rational flows . in this paper",
    "we take a closer look at non - rational solutions of ( [ funkk ] ) whose vector field is a pair of quadratic forms . in general , every vector field whose orbit is given by a homogeneous rational function of degree @xmath39 gives rise , generally , not to a rational flow but to a quasi - rational flow ; see the subsection [ sub - qf ] and @xcite .",
    "consider the following two - variable two - dimensional functions : @xmath40}{\\bullet}\\frac{y}{y+1}&&= \\frac{xy}{(y+1)[y+xf(y)]}{\\bullet}\\frac{y}{y+1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( here in each case @xmath41 stands for the corresponding function , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and so on ) .",
    "we can check directly that these functions satisfy the prte ( [ funkk ] ) .",
    "the vector fields and the equations for the orbits of these flows are given by       the symbols @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for example , obey the rules @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "so , the case @xmath48 corresponds a bijection of @xmath49 onto itself and thus to torus rather than a sphere . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of the flow @xmath50 leads to investigations of the arithmetic of genus @xmath51 cubic @xmath52 over @xmath53 .",
    "further , it is obvious that the number of projective flows over a finite field in any dimension is finite .",
    "finally , note that the exponential flow @xmath54 has no analogue in the finite field setting ; for example , the flow @xmath55 is not property defined on @xmath56 for @xmath57 odd .",
    "so , we formulate the following    let @xmath58 .",
    "describe all projective flows over @xmath59 .",
    "what is the total number of flows ?",
    "how they distribute among different completions of @xmath59 ?",
    "do all these flows arise as reductions mod @xmath57 of rational flows over @xmath60 ( like @xmath61 above ) ?                        , _ higher transcendental functions .",

    "<S> we are interested in all non - singular ( satisfying the boundary condition ) and unramified ( without branching points , i.e. single - valued functions in @xmath4 ) projective flows whose vector field is still rational . if an orbit of the flow is given by homogeneous rational function of degree @xmath5 , then @xmath5 is called the level of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , up to conjugation with @xmath6-homogenic birational plane transformation , these are of @xmath7 types : 1 ) the identity flow ; 2 ) one flow for each non - negative integer @xmath5 - these flows are rational of level @xmath5 ; 3 ) the level @xmath6 exponential flow , which is also conjugate to the level @xmath6 tangent flow ; 4 ) the level @xmath8 flow expressable in terms of dixonian ( equianharmonic ) elliptic functions ; 5 ) the level @xmath9 flow expressable in terms of lemniscatic elliptic functions ; 6 ) the level @xmath7 flow expressable in terms of dixonian elliptic functions again . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals another aspect of the prte : in the latter four cases this equation is equivalent and provides a uniform framework to addition formulas for exponential , tangent , or special elliptic functions ( also addition formulas for polynomials and the logarithm , though the latter appears only in branched flows ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the prte turns out to have a connection with plya - eggenberger urn models . </S>",
    "<S> another purpose of this study is expository , and we provide the list of open problems and directions in the theory of prte ; for example , we define the notion of quasi - rational projective flows which includes curves of arbitrary genus . </S>",
    "<S> this study , though seemingly analytic , is in fact algebraic and our method reduces to algebraic transformations in various quotient rings of rational function fields . </S>"
