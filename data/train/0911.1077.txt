    "for several decades , our only direct probes of the high - redshift universe were qsos and radio galaxies .",
    "while significant insight into the properties and evolution of these populations was obtained , almost nothing was known about the population of normal galaxies at high @xmath1 .",
    "this has changed radically over the last decade .",
    "deep imaging and spectroscopy from the ground and from space have revealed a rich and diverse population of high-@xmath1 galaxies , and enormous progress has been made in establishing a complete inventory of the high-@xmath1 universe , in terms of mass and metallicity budget , energy output and evolution over cosmic time .",
    "in addition , first investigations of the genesis of the fundamental scaling relations of galaxies ( e.g. , the fundamental plane and the tully - fisher relation ) are being undertaken , and will provide insight into the origin of the galaxy population itself .",
    "one of the most remarkable scaling relations is the @xmath2 relation , i.e. , the relation between the mass of a nuclear supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and the velocity dispersion of the spheroid ( elliptical or bulge ) hosting the black hole @xcite .",
    "the fact that the black hole mass and total galaxy mass are closely related is truly remarkable , given that there is a factor of @xmath3 between the au - size schwarzschild radius of the black hole and the kpc - size dimension of the galaxy .",
    "this is generally interpreted as evidence that the formation and growth of the smbh is directly related to the formation process of the stellar population , e.g. , in a violent burst of star formation .",
    "the picture of the simultaneous build - up of a smbh with an extreme burst of star formation provides a new context for the luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) , long suggested to be the birthplaces of smbhs powering active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "studies of local ulirgs demonstrate that they plausibly evolve into moderate mass field ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the giant ellipticals in the local universe would then be the result of similar but much more extreme events at higher redshifts .",
    "indeed , the population of submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) provides the more luminous high redshift counterpart of the local lirgs and ulirgs and may be responsible for the formation of local massive spheroids and for generating qso activity at high redshift @xcite .    .",
    "note that high-@xmath0 co emission is expected in both cases , but vastly more prominently in the xdr @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "theoretically , a number of mechanisms have been proposed for establishing the @xmath2 relation @xcite , but attempts at observational tests of these models are extremely challenging and have sometimes produced conflicting results @xcite .",
    "spica provides a new window on this problem with its sensitivity in the far - infrared region .",
    "this region contains the key cooling transitions of photon - dominated regions ( pdrs , heated by stellar uv radiation ) and x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs , heated by the x - ray radiation from an accreting smbh ) .",
    "advanced pdr / xdr models @xcite reveal the significantly different spectral patterns from xdrs and pdrs . in both cases cooling is provided by the principal fine - structure lines ( [ cii ] @xmath4 m , [ oi ] 63 and @xmath5 m with in some regions of parameter space contributions from [ siii ] and [ feii ] lines ) as well as rotational lines of co and rotational and vibrational lines of h@xmath6 .",
    "however , the flux distribution over the co rotational ladder is vastly different for pdrs and xdrs . in the uv",
    ", a 10ev photon penetrates a column of about @xmath7@xmath8 ( for solar metallicity ) before being absorbed by dust grains .",
    "uv photons also have the right energy to dissociate co between 11.2 en 13.6ev .",
    "in contrast , a 1kev x - ray photon traverses a column of @xmath9@xmath8 before absorption by hydrogen and metals occurs , since the absorption cross section scales as @xmath101/energy@xmath11 .",
    "because of their high energy , neither x - rays nor the induced secondary electrons destroy co efficiently . furthermore , uv photons cause photoelectric heating when electrons are liberated from ( small ) dust grains , with an efficiency of no more than 1% .",
    "x - rays on the other hand heat through ionization and ( mostly ) the subsequent coulomb interactions of liberated very fast electrons , with an efficiency of about @xmath12% ( depending on the electron abundance ) . consequently , pdrs , associated with star formation , contain co layers that are relatively cool ( @xmath13k ) , while xdrs , associated with black hole accretion , are characterized by deeper layers of much warmer co ( @xmath14k ) .    in fig .",
    "[ vanderwerfp_fig1 ] a comparison is presented between a pdr and an xdr for a density of @xmath15@xmath16 and an illuminating radiation field of @xmath17ergs@xmath18@xmath8 , representative of a region like the orion bar in the milky way ( in the uv ) or gas at a hundred parsecs from an accreting black hole powering a seyfert nucleus with a luminosity of @xmath19 erg s@xmath18 ( in x - rays ) .",
    "it should be noted that the pdr case included here pushes the most extreme range expected in starburst galaxies , while x - ray fluxes as low as 5ergs@xmath18@xmath8 , impinging on @xmath20@xmath16 gas are still capable of producing substantial co emission at very high @xmath0 co levels .",
    "the co ladder at high @xmath0 levels thus constitutes a unique diagnostic of smbh accretion activity in the spica / safari wavelength range .",
    "real galaxies will of course produce a mixture of pdr and xdr emission .",
    "separating these will require ( a ) a complete inventory of the cooling emission lines at high sensitivity ; ( b ) accurate modeling with state - of - the - art pdr and xdr codes , including radiative transfer in 3 dimensions ; ( c ) additional data for constraining local densities ( density - tracing molecules ) , column densities ( isotopomeric lines ) , sizes of emission regions ( high resolution alma imaging ) , as well as high - quality x - ray and infrared data .",
    "all of these will be in reach within the coming decade , and thus we may have some optimism that a reliable separation of star formation and agn as contributors to the total luminosity of galaxies ( which has been elusive problem for many years ) can indeed be achieved with spica .     and a well - constrained model for the higher lines .",
    "the co is modeled as a combination of a diffuse and a dense phase , with the dense phase containing most of the mass and emitting most of the cooling radiation , comparable in total luminosity to the [ cii ] line.,width=302 ]",
    "reasonably detailed co spectral line energy distributions are gradually becoming available , for instance for m82 @xcite and ngc253 @xcite , although for low-@xmath1 galaxies they still do not probe higher rotational levels than @xmath21 . the first high - quality co flux distribution for a ulirg was presented by @xcite for the nearby ulirg .",
    "these authors conclude that the co ladder requires a two - component model : one component of fairly diffuse gas dominating the low-@xmath0 lines and one component of dense gas dominating at @xmath22 .",
    "remarkably , it was found that the dense component dominates the molecular gas mass as well as the total cooling radiation from .",
    "the total cooling by this component approaches that by the [ cii ] line , implying a totally different thermal balance than in for instance the milky way .",
    "the derived cooling budget is shown in fig .",
    "[ vanderwerfp_fig2 ] .",
    "this result also sheds new light on the discovery with the iso satelite that in ulirgs the [ cii]/@xmath23 ratio is about a factor of 10 lower than in lower luminosity galaxies ( where the [ cii ] @xmath4 m line typically contains @xmath24% of @xmath23 ) .",
    "physically , this situation can arise in dense pdrs ( where the ionized carbon layer is thin and the molecular gas layer is close to the heating source ) , in xdrs , or in pdrs with an enhanced cosmic ray flux .",
    "these possibilities can be distinguished using the more comprehensive data that will be obtained by the herschel comprehensive ulirg emission survey ( hercules ) .",
    "this project will obtain full spectra of the co ladder from @xmath25 to 13 as well as the key cooling lines of [ cii ] ( @xmath4 m ) and [ oi ] ( 63 and @xmath5 m ) for a flux - limited sample of 29 local lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "this project will be an important pathfinder for future studies with spica / safari .     or",
    "co @xmath26 @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "to date , detections of co have been reported in about 50 objects at @xmath27 , 38 of which are mentioned in the review by @xcite . of these 38 , 22 are at redshifts @xmath28 , the time in cosmic evolution in which both the qso and the smg activity peak .",
    "multi - line co studies of the 12 brightest of these ( 8  qsos and 4  smgs with no signs of agn activity ) are being carried out using the iram and apex telescopes .",
    "these observations typically cover co rotational lines from @xmath29 to @xmath30 @xcite . a compilation , compared with the flux distribution of @xcite is shown in fig .  [ vanderwerfp_fig3 ] .",
    "the location of the peak of the co flux distribution reveals different excitation conditions within the sample . for qsos",
    "the peak typically occurs at the @xmath31 or @xmath32 transition , indicative of a gas density of @xmath33@xmath16 and a kinetic temperature of @xmath34k . for the co excitation",
    "is by higher by a large margin . here",
    "the flux distribution peaks at the @xmath35 transition .",
    "the smgs in the sample tend to have a lower gas excitation than the qsos with a peak of the co ladder typically at the @xmath36 line .",
    "these co ladders are similar to those observed in the central region of some local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , m82 and ngc253 , see references in section  [ vanderwerfp.seclowz ] ) .",
    "the lowest co excitation is observed toward the extremely red object where the turnover of the flux distribution already occurs at the co @xmath37 line @xcite .",
    "although this set of co lines constrains the properties of the bulk of the co emitting gas , surprising results are obtained when the co ladder is probed beyond the peak , as can be seen in the two qsos at @xmath38 ( and ) where the observations even include co lines up to @xmath39 , in the rest - frame thz regime @xcite .",
    "the co @xmath40 and @xmath41 lines in the qso host galaxy ( @xmath42 ) show a clear flux excess compared to the single excitation model which describes the peak of the co ladder and require a second gas component with even higher co excitation . this component may be related to a denser component ( also indicated by hcn observations ) , or alternatively to a hotter component heated by the agn such as in , and",
    "can be modeled using the co ladders shown in fig .",
    "[ vanderwerfp_fig1 ] .",
    "interestingly , a similar co ladder is observed towards the , but there the high - excitation component is energetically much less important .    in summary , observations of high-@xmath1 sources allow access to diagnostic lines of co which are very difficult to obtain from ground based observations for sources in the local universe .",
    "this leads to the somewhat paradoxical situation , that the gas properties for some high-@xmath1 redshift objects are currently better constrained than those of most nearby infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "the situation will be significantly improved by the hercules project , referred to in section  [ vanderwerfp.seclowz ] . expanding such observations to lower luminosity galaxies , larger distances and higher @xmath0 co lines , in order to fully exploit the diagnostic use of the co ladder , will be a major task for spica / safari .",
    "co , h@xmath6 s(0 ) and s(1 ) ( as well as lines from h@xmath43 and heh@xmath44 ) are shown as functions of metallicity and x - ray flux for a density of @xmath45@xmath16 .",
    "the impinging x - ray flux takes on values of 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100ergs@xmath18@xmath8 ; and the metallicity values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 of solar @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "a key question is what happens in galaxies of extremely low metallicity , where the [ cii ] , [ oi ] and co cooling channels are not available . in standard cosmological models , a significant population of dark matter halos collapses at redshifts larger than 5 , aided by atomic ( hi and",
    "heii lyman @xmath49 ) and molecular ( h@xmath6 and hd ) cooling , and hosts the first stars and accreting black holes @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath6 rotational and ro - vibrational lines are accessible to safari and cool the ( molecular ) medium in systems with metallicities @xmath50 solar . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , a number of these lines",
    "are expected to be detectable with jwst , alma and spica / safari , over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "h@xmath6 cooling emission from population  iii star forming regions at @xmath51 will be too faint for detection , but primordial star forming gas in @xmath52 galaxies should be detectable with safari due to the enhanced ionization and molecule formation caused by virialization shocks @xcite . furthermore , the presence of an accreting black hole leads to the copious production of x - rays .",
    "in such x - ray irradiated gas , typical line intensities can be of the order of @xmath53erg s@xmath18 @xmath8 sr@xmath18 for the pure rotational lines of h@xmath6 at 28 , 17 , etc .",
    "@xmath54 m , which is as much as @xmath55 of the black hole s accretion - driven x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "flux distributions for various parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ vanderwerfp_fig4 ] , which shows the dominant role of h@xmath6 at the lowest metallicities .",
    "given the tight relation between supermassive black holes and the stellar spheroids that host them , it seems reasonable to use the extended press - schechter formalism and assume that ( a ) the @xmath2 holds at high redshift too , so the black hole mass is @xmath56 of the total dark matter mass , that ( b ) black holes radiate at 10% of eddington , yielding an x - ray dominated zone of @xmath57 pc , and that ( c ) star formation and black hole growth are roughly simultaneous , with similar contributions to the luminosity .",
    "the latter implies star formation rates of @xmath58yr@xmath18 within the central 2kpc , quickly enriching the pristine gas , but the presence of a black hole alone is quite sufficient for safari detections .    for the @xmath59cdm concordance model",
    ", one then finds about 10 of such sources per @xmath60 field - of - view .",
    "the main contribution comes from @xmath61 halos with masses @xmath62 m@xmath63 that yield h@xmath6 line fluxes of @xmath64 w m@xmath65 , comfortably above the @xmath66 wm@xmath65 safari detection threshold . typically , at least two pure rotational h@xmath6 lines ( e.g. , s(0 ) , s(1 ) , s(2 ) , etc .",
    ") are detectable for a @xmath52 source , allowing line confusion due to redshifted mid - infrared lines from far - infrared sources to be dealt with .",
    "spica / safari targets will likely be provided by jwst , which will discover many @xmath67 galaxies .",
