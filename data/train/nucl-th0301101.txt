    "the appearance of spontaneous spin polarized states in nuclear matter is the topic of a great current interest due to relevance in astrophysics . according as nuclear matter",
    "is spin polarized or not , drastically different scenarios of supernova explosion and cooling of neutron stars can be realized . the possibility of a phase transition of normal nuclear matter to ferromagnetic state was studied by many authors . in ref .",
    "@xcite within a hard sphere gas model it was shown that neutron matter becomes ferromagnetic at @xmath1 . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was found that the inclusion of long  range attraction significantly increases the ferromagnetic transition density ( e.g. , up to @xmath2 in the brueckner theory with a simple central potential and hard core only for singlet spin states  @xcite ) . calculations of magnetic susceptibility in ref .",
    "@xcite with skyrme effective forces showed that a ferromagnetic transition occurs at @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "the fermi liquid criterion for the ferromagnetic instability in neutron matter with skyrme interaction is reached at @xmath5@xmath6  @xcite , @xmath7 being nuclear matter saturation density . in ref .",
    "@xcite there were formulated general conditions on the parameters of neutron ",
    "neutron interaction , which result in the magnetically ordered state of neutron matter .",
    "the spin correlations in dense neutron matter within the relativistic dirac  hartree  fock approach with the effective nucleon  meson lagrangian were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , predicting the ferromagnetic transition at several times nuclear matter saturation density . the importance of the fock exchange term in the relativistic mean  field approach for occurrence of ferromagnetism in nuclear matter was established in ref .",
    "the stability of strongly asymmetric nuclear matter with respect to spin fluctuations was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that even small proton admixture favors the ferromagnetic instability of the system .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed also by calculations within the relativistic dirac  hartree  fock approach to strongly asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "if to consider the models with realistic nucleon  nucleon ( nn ) interaction , the ferromagnetic phase transition seems to be suppressed up to densities well above @xmath7  @xcite@xcite .",

    "the antiferromagnetic spin polarization parameter will be determined as a function of density as well .",
