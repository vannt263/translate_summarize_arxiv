    "the standard textbook description of the cosmological models usually is limited to the description of the three friedmann models , describing a closed universe , and infinite topologically trivial flat and open universes .",
    "however , in his papers friedmann noted that even flat and open universes may be compact if they have nontrivial topology @xcite .",
    "he described how space could be finite and multi - connected by suitably identifying points , and predicted the possible existence of  ghost \" images of astronomical sources .",
    "the possibility that we may live in a compact universe with nontrivial topology was mentioned even earlier by schwarzschild @xcite . since that time",
    ", there were dozens of papers on the compact flat or open universes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this possibility is not mentioned even as a footnote in most of the textbooks on cosmology and general theory or relativity .",
    "this attitude is quite understandable .",
    "first of all , we still do not have a compelling observational evidence of the nontrivial topology of the universe @xcite , even though the situation may change with the further investigation of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "moreover , inflation typically makes the universe so large that it removes any hope for the observational study of its topological structure , unless one fine - tunes the total number of e - folds of inflation and bends the overall shape of the scalar potential in a rather peculiar way @xcite .",
    "so one may wonder why should we spend our time studying topology of the universe if it is not supported by experimental evidence and theoretical expectations ?    as we will argue in this paper , the models of a compact flat or open ( hyperbolic ) universe with nontrivial topology may play an important role in inflationary cosmology by providing proper initial conditions for low - scale inflation .",
    "most of our arguments will be based on results obtained in the papers on quantum creation of the compact universe with nontrivial topology @xcite and in the papers on chaotic mixing @xcite .",
    "however , we will look at these results from a slightly different perspective : we will try to find out how the probability of initial conditions for inflation depends on the effective potential of the inflaton field @xmath0 for various versions of topology of the universe .",
    "let us first remember some basic facts related to the problem of initial conditions for inflation @xcite .",
    "inflation appears in a patch of a closed universe or of an infinite flat or open universe if this patch is sufficiently homogeneous and its size is greater than the size of the horizon , @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is a flat inflationary potential .",
    "the simplest inflationary scenario is based on the theory of a scalar field with the potential @xmath2 .",
    "formally , inflation in this scenario can start at an arbitrarily large values of @xmath3 , i.e. close to the cosmological singularity . in this paper",
    "we will use the system of units @xmath4 .",
    "if we assume that the standard description of the universe in terms of the classical space - time becomes possible only below the planck density @xmath5 , then inflation may begin , for example , in a closed universe of the smallest possible size @xmath6 with the total entropy @xmath7 .",
    "these conditions seem quite natural and easy to satisfy ; see e.g. a discussion of this issue in @xcite .",
    "however , in all inflationary models where the effective potential does not change too much during the last stages of inflation one has a general constraint @xmath8 , which follows from the constraint on the amplitude of gravitational waves generated during inflation . in many inflationary models , such as new inflation , hybrid inflation , etc .",
    ", inflation occurs at @xmath9 . in these models ,",
    "the problem of initial conditions becomes more complicated .",
    "consider , for example , a closed universe filled with radiation . at the planck time , the energy density of radiation @xmath10 was completely dominated the total energy density @xmath11 .",
    "inflation begins only when the universe cools down and the energy density of radiation becomes much smaller than @xmath0 , which happens at @xmath12 .",
    "the problem is that a radiation dominated closed universe may die before this happens .    indeed , a closed universe with energy density dominated by radiation collapses within the time @xmath13 ( in planckian units ) , where @xmath14 is the total entropy of the universe @xcite .",
    "if we want the universe to survive until its energy density drops down to @xmath0 , its initial entropy should be greater than @xmath15 .",
    "this means , e.g. , that for the models where inflation may occur only at @xmath16 , the initial entropy of the universe must be @xmath17 . at the planck time",
    "the total mass of such universe would be greater than @xmath18 in planck units , and it would consist of @xmath18 causally disconnected regions of planck size . thus in order to explain why our universe is so large and homogeneous we would need to assume that it was very large and homogeneous from the very beginning @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the probability of such event for the universe initially dominated by relativistic matter suggests that it should be suppressed by a factor of @xmath19 , and the probability that not only the energy density but also the scalar field in such a universe will be sufficiently homogeneous may be even smaller @xcite .",
    "another way to look at the same problem is to assume that instead of being born in a singularity and passing through the radiation dominated stage , a closed universe was created `` from nothing '' ( i.e. from a state with a scale factor @xmath20 ) in an inflationary state dominated by the inflaton potential energy @xmath0 .",
    "however , the minimal size of a closed inflationary universe is given by @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the universe with @xmath22 can not classically evolve starting from the point @xmath23 .",
    "since this process is forbidden at the classical level , the universe must tunnel through a potential barrier .",
    "an investigation of this issue using euclidean approach to quantum cosmology suggested @xcite that the probability of quantum creation of a closed inflationary universe is exponentially suppressed by a factor of @xmath24    this result has an obvious interpretation .",
    "creation of the universe from nothing implies emergence of a universe with initial volume @xmath25 and with total energy of matter @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 ( planck density ) , uncertainty relations tell us that such fluctuations can readily occur within the planck time @xmath28 , but for @xmath29 these fluctuations should be extremely improbable , which is reflected in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in a particular example with @xmath30 , the probability of quantum creation of inflationary universe is suppressed . in this case , the probability of inflation is also exponentially suppressed , as compared with the probability of living in the deepest minimum of @xmath0 . in our opinion , this function , as well as its recent modifications @xcite , describe the probability of the _ final _ conditions in the universe , instead of the _ initial _ conditions ; see a discussion of this issue in @xcite .",
    "it is important that in either interpretation , the exponential suppression of probability is due to the tunneling , i.e. due to the classically forbidden evolution .",
    "] by the factor of @xmath31 .",
    "open and flat inflationary universes can classically evolve from @xmath32 without any tunneling .",
    "however , we do not know any way to create an infinite homogeneous flat universe .",
    "there are two different ways to create an infinite homogeneous open universe .",
    "the first one involves creating a closed inflationary universe of the old inflation type .",
    "then one must ensure that it decays by bubble formation and that the slow - roll inflation occurs inside each bubble @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to create an infinite open universe directly , using a different analytic continuation of the instanton of the same type as the one used for the description of creation of a closed universe @xcite .",
    "both cases involve tunneling and exponential suppression of the probability of creation of an inflationary universe with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we identified the root of the problem of initial conditions for creation of a closed or an infinitely large open inflationary universe : if the universe initially was matter dominated , it should contain a very large nearly homogeneous patch with large initial mass and entropy . if , on the other hand , we consider a possibility of a quantum creation of the universe , the probability of such an event is exponentially suppressed because a part of the trajectory describing creation of the universe is forbidden at the classical level .",
    "however , in a compact flat or open universe none of these problems exist , under certain conditions to be discussed below .",
    "consider for simplicity the flat compact universe having the topology of a torus , @xmath33 , @xmath34 with identification @xmath35 for each of the three dimensions .",
    "consider for simplicity the case @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the curvature of the universe and the einstein equations written in terms of @xmath37 will be the same as in the infinite flat friedmann universe with metric @xmath38 . in our notation ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath37 is equal to the size of the universe in planck units @xmath39 .",
    "let us assume , as we did in the beginning of the previous section , that at the planck time @xmath40 the universe was radiation dominated , @xmath41 .",
    "let us also assume that at the planck time the total size of the box was planckian , @xmath42 . in such case",
    "the whole universe initially contained only @xmath43 relativistic particles such as photons or gravitons , so that the total entropy of the whole universe was o(1 ) .    in general , in addition to the energy of relativistic particles one should also consider the casimir energy which appears due to the finiteness of the size of the box",
    "however , casimir energy is suppressed by supersymmetry . in the absence of supersymmetry , this energy is @xmath44 , so if @xmath45 is somewhat greater than @xmath46 at the planck density , this energy always remains smaller than the thermal energy .",
    "the size of the universe dominated by relativistic particles was growing as @xmath47 , whereas the mean free path of the gravitons was growing as @xmath48 .",
    "if the initial size of the universe was @xmath43 , then at the time @xmath49 each particle ( or a gravitational perturbation of metric ) within one cosmological time would run all over the torus many times , appearing in all of its parts with nearly equal probability .",
    "this effect , called `` chaotic mixing , '' should lead to a rapid homogenization of the universe @xcite .",
    "note , that to achieve a modest degree of homogeneity required for inflation to start when the density of ordinary matter drops down , we do not even need chaotic mixing . indeed",
    ", density perturbations do not grow in a universe dominated by ultrarelativistic particles if the size of the universe is smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "as we just mentioned , this is exactly what happens in our model .",
    "note that this homogenization applies to all light fields , including the inflaton field .",
    "consider , for example , an initial domain of a planckian size @xmath43 , containing the inhomogeneities of the scalar field with the energy density @xmath51 .",
    "since the mass squared of the inflaton field is much smaller than @xmath52 , and the size of the universe prior to inflation is smaller than @xmath50 , perturbations of this field behave as ultrarelativistic particles , the distribution of density of scalar perturbations becomes nearly homogeneous , and the energy density of the gradients of the scalar field will decrease as the energy of radiation ( as @xmath53 ) all the way until the beginning of inflation when @xmath0 begins to dominate .",
    "chaotic mixing can be very efficient in a compact hyperbolic universe ( i.e. in a compactified version of an open universe ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effective energy associated with the curvature of 3d space in the open universe case decreases as @xmath54 , i.e. much more slowly than the energy of ordinary matter .",
    "soon after the beginning of expansion , the curvature energy density becomes dominant , and the relative role of normal matter and of its density perturbations become insignificant .",
    "this is an additional reason to expect that the density perturbations in a compact hyperbolic universe will rapidly decrease @xcite .",
    "therefore the universe should remain relatively homogeneous until the thermal energy density drops below @xmath52 and inflation begins .",
    "one may wonder whether we need inflation at all if a compact universe can be efficiently homogenized .",
    "but the main reason why it becomes homogeneous is because we were able to start with a universe of a very small size . in a non - inflationary universe of the present size",
    ", chaotic mixing would not have enough time to occur since the present part of the universe only now becomes causally connected . if one starts with the universe with a typical 3d curvature @xmath43 , then in the absence of inflation our universe would have vanishingly small @xmath55 . finally , in the absence of inflation one would have no explanation to the large entropy of the observable part of the universe , @xmath56 , and we would have problems explaining the origin of the large scale structure of the universe , as well as the cmb anisotropy .    thus without the help of inflation",
    "the effects considered above can not solve the major cosmological problems .",
    "however , they can keep the universe sufficiently homogeneous until the onset of inflation .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite discussed conditions which could lead to damping of initial density perturbations down to @xmath57 , with the goal to have only a relatively short stage of inflation and obtain a model of a homogeneous universe with @xmath58 .",
    "our goals are much more modest : we only need the initial expanding domain of the universe to be sufficiently homogeneous ( @xmath59 ) for the onset of the subsequent stage of inflation .",
    "it seems rather easy to achieve such a damping of density perturbations at the radiation dominated stage in a domain of the horizon size , or of the size smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "one could not use this mechanism in the non - inflationary models of a closed or open universe because our universe previously consisted of many causally disconnected domains of horizon size , but one can do it during the pre - inflationary stage in our scenario .    similarly , it was shown long ago that particle production in the very early universe can make the universe locally isotropic @xcite .",
    "however , this process could not make the universe globally isotropic because in the hot big bang scenario the universe consisted of many causally disconnected domains .",
    "but such effects may play important role in our scenario by making the initial small patch of the universe isotropic , and then this isotropy will be further enhanced by the subsequent stage of inflation .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the size of a flat universe of initial planckian size at the moment when inflation begins .",
    "this happens when @xmath60 drops from @xmath43 to @xmath0 , i.e. at @xmath61 .",
    "note that in this case the size of the universe at the beginning of inflation is much smaller than the size of ds horizon @xmath62 .",
    "this is a counterexample to the common lore that the size of inflationary universe must be greater than @xmath50 .    the probability of creation of a small part of the universe of a size @xmath43 at the planck density is not expected to be exponentially suppressed .",
    "most importantly , since at that time the evolution of the universe is dominated by the relativistic matter , this probability practically does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "after that , inflation occurs in an expanding and cooling universe automatically , if the inflaton field did not strongly interact with matter and if from the very beginning it was staying at the flat ( inflationary ) region of the effective potential .",
    "of course , there will be some suppression of the probability of inflationary initial conditions if an inflationary regime occurs only for a narrow range of initial values of the inflaton field .",
    "however , this phase space suppression is much milder than the exponential suppression of the type described by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "one can argue that this suppression can be easily compensated by the exponential growth of volume of the inflationary domains .",
    "we conclude that in this class of cosmological models , unlike in the usual case of a closed or an infinite open universe , _ the probability of inflation is not exponentially suppressed for the theories with @xmath22_.      now we will study a possibility that the universe from the very beginning is dominated by the potential energy density of the scalar field .",
    "as we already discussed , in the closed universe case such solutions require tunneling from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "one way to see it is to study the well - known wheeler - dewitt equation for a closed de sitter ( ds ) universe @xcite : @xmath65\\psi(a ) = 0\\ ] ] in this equation we temporarily ignored the evolution of the scalar fields ( we will discuss it later , see eqs .",

    "meanwhile for a flat ds universe with a toroidal compactification the cosmological evolution can begin at an arbitrarily small @xmath45 , i.e. there is no need to tunnel through a classically forbidden region of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by zeldovich and starobinsky , in this case , unlike in the case of the topologically trivial flat ds universe , the flat compactified ds is geodesically complete @xcite .    in order to derive the wheeler - dewitt equation for the compact flat toroidal universe , one should first consider the gravitational action @xmath69 and take into account that the volume of the 3d box is equal to @xmath70 .",

    "one should note that here we ignored the casimir effect , which may give an important quantum contribution @xmath44 to the vacuum energy density @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "this contribution may be negative , which will again forbid the classical evolution at @xmath78 .",
    "however , this effect is suppressed by supersymmetry @xcite , it disappears in some anisotropic versions of toroidal compactification @xcite , and , as we mentioned in the previous section , it becomes unimportant if one takes into account the usual matter contribution , or the 3d curvature in the open universe case .    for large @xmath45 , the solution of eq .",

    "the meaning of this result , to be discussed below in a more detailed way , is that at @xmath81 the effective action corresponding to the expanding universe is very large , and the universe can be described in terms of classical space and time .",
    "meanwhile at @xmath80 , the effective action becomes small , the classical description breaks down , and quantum uncertainty becomes large .",
    "in other words , contrary to the usual expectations , at @xmath80 one can not describe the universe in terms of a classical space - time even though the size of the universe at @xmath82 is much greater than the planck size , and the density of matter as well as the curvature scalar in this regime remains small , @xmath83 .",

    "it may survive due to tunneling , but the probability of this event is suppressed by @xmath133 .    one can avoid the tunneling if the universe was created with kinetic energy @xmath134 , but in this case one would need to explain how could it happen that the universe at the planck density contained matter with a total mass greater than @xmath132 planck masses ( which was greater than @xmath135 for @xmath136 ) , and why it was homogeneous if it consisted of @xmath132 causally disconnected domains .",

    "this is an important consideration , because inflation in the string theory landscape scenario is eternal @xcite .",
    "however , evaluation of probabilities in eternal inflation scenario is a rather delicate issue , which requires investigation of measure in quantum cosmology .",
    "moreover , there are many inflationary models that do not lead to eternal inflation .",
    "therefore it is good to have an independent argument that in certain cosmological models there is no exponential suppression of the probability to have inflation with @xmath29 .    independently of the issues related to eternal inflation , our investigation leads us to a rather unexpected conclusion .",
    "if inflation is eternal , the universe should look like an eternally growing fractal @xcite .",
    "if inflation is not eternal , then our investigation suggests that most probably we live in a flat or open compact universe with nontrivial topology .",
    "none of these possibilities correspond to the standard textbook models of a closed universe or of an infinite flat or open universe .",
