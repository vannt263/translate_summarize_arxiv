    "throughout this paper we will adopt the notation and terminology on schur functions taken from the standard text by macdonald  @xcite .",
    "the schur functions @xmath0 , indexed by partitions @xmath1 , form a @xmath2-basis of the ring of symmetric functions .",
    "this basis is orthonormal , and the corresponding bilinear form enables one to define skew schur functions @xmath3 , indexed by pairs of partitions @xmath1 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "each such skew schur function @xmath3 can be expressed as a sum of schur functions @xmath6 with non - negative integer multiplicities given by the well - known littlewood - richardson coefficients , @xmath7 .",
    "these same coefficients govern the decomposition of the product @xmath8 of two schur functions as a sum of schur functions @xmath0 .    in @xcite , stembridge classified the products of schur functions that are multiplicity - free , that is those pairs of schur functions for which every coefficient in the schur function expansion of their product is @xmath9 or @xmath10 , as in the following theorem :    [ thm - stem ] the schur function product @xmath8 is multiplicity - free if and only if one or more of the following is true :    p0 : :    @xmath4 or @xmath11 is the zero partition    @xmath9 ; p1 : :    @xmath4 or @xmath11 is a one - line rectangle ; p2 : :    @xmath4 is a two - line rectangle and @xmath11 is a    fat hook ( or vice versa ) ; p3 : :    @xmath4 is a rectangle and @xmath11 is a    near - rectangle ( or vice versa ) ; p4 : :    @xmath4 and @xmath11 are rectangles .",
    "[ description - stemlist ]    here each partition @xmath1 is to be identified with the corresponding young diagram @xmath12 , and is said to be a rectangle if @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and a fat hook if @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a rectangle @xmath19 is a one - line rectangle if @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and a two - line rectangle if @xmath22 with @xmath23 or @xmath24 . a fat hook @xmath25 is a near rectangle if any one or more of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "stembridge  @xcite also gave a corresponding theorem applicable to the case where the lengths of the partitions satisfy @xmath30 and the schur function product is restricted to the ring , @xmath31 , of symmetric functions in a finite number of variables @xmath32 .",
    "to do this he invoked , in the particular case @xmath33 , the use of the partition @xmath34 , which may be said to be @xmath35-complementary to @xmath1 .",
    "more recently , thomas and yong  @xcite established a multiplicity - free result for the product of two schubert classes @xmath36 in the cohomolgy ring @xmath37 of the grasmannian @xmath38 of @xmath39-dimensional subspaces in @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficients in this product of schubert classes are just the usual littlewood - richardson coefficients , @xmath7 , but this time restricted to the case @xmath41 .",
    "this allows , thomas and yong s result to be recast in terms of skew schur functions .",
    "when this is done it coincides with the multiplicity - free result for skew schur functions derived independently by gutschwager  @xcite .",

    "it need not be connected . as will be seen ,",
    "every skew schur function is equal , in a rather trivial way , to some basic skew schur function . in stating the theorem it is also convenient to follow thomas and yong in letting the @xmath35-shortness of a partition @xmath41 be the length of the shortest straight line segment of the path of length @xmath43 from the southwest to northeast corner of @xmath44 that separates @xmath12 from the @xmath45-rotation of @xmath46 . with this definition , the result ,",
    "jointly attributable both to gutschwager and to thomas and yong , takes the form :    [ thm - main ] the basic skew schur function @xmath3 is multiplicity - free if and only if one or more of the following is true :    r0 : :    @xmath4 or @xmath47 is the zero partition    @xmath9 ; r1 : :    @xmath4 or @xmath47 is a rectangle of    @xmath35-shortness @xmath10 ; r2 : :    @xmath4 is a rectangle of @xmath35-shortness    @xmath48 and @xmath47 is a fat hook ( or vice    versa ) ; r3 : :    @xmath4 is a rectangle and @xmath47 is a    fat hook of @xmath35-shortness @xmath10 ( or vice    versa ) ;",

    "@xcite used the traditional model of littlewood - richardson coefficients  @xcite :    the littlewood - richardson coefficient @xmath50 is equal to the number of semistandard young tableaux of shape @xmath51 and content @xmath11 whose reverse reading word is a lattice permutation .",
    "[ thm - lrrule ]    here , our aim is to rederive both theorems  [ thm - stem ] and  [ thm - main ] by means of a different combinatorial model , namely the hive model  @xcite for these coefficients :    the littlewood - richardson coefficient @xmath50 is equal to the number of distinct integer lr - hives with boundary edge labels specified by the partitions @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath11 .",
    "[ thm - lrhives ]    the hive model introduced in  @xcite arose as a reformulation of a convex polytope model  @xcite .",

    "see also  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of advantages to the hive model approach , including the fact that it allows a direct proof that all the cases enumerated in both theorem  [ thm - stem ] and theorem  [ thm - main ] are indeed multiplicity - free .",
    "it also lends itself well to the uniform statement of theorem  [ thm - main ] , simultaneously covering both connected and disconnected cases .",
    "what is avoided in the hive model proof that all the indicated multiplicity - free cases are indeed multiplicity - free is any recourse to the non - trivial order filter , introduced by stembridge and generalised by gutschwager , that underlies two families of inequalities of the form @xmath52 that are also heavily used by thomas and yong in the form of what they call stembridge demolitions . although we can not avoid the use of such inequalities in dealing with all possible non - multiplicity - free cases ,",
    "the hive model does allow us to be completely explicit about the route from the most general cases to those for which a multiplicity of at least two occurs .",
    "in doing so the hive model offers some insight into the origin of the breakdown of multiplicity - freeness for both products of schur functions and expansions of skew schur functions .",
    "this lies in the fact that within the appropriate lr - hives there always exists an elementary hexagon whose interior edge labels are not fixed .",
    "the precise nature of the somewhat numerous conditions for the breakdown of multiplicity - freeness can then be exposed in each case through consideration of a single hive diagram .    in the next section",
    ", we make some necessary definitions regarding partitions , skew schur functions and littlewood - richardson coefficients . in section  [ sec - hive - model ] we define integer @xmath53-hives and the lr - hives whose enumeration for fixed boundary labels provides a model for evaluating littlewood - richardson coefficients .",
    "a sequence of lemmas regarding lr - hives and subhives are derived in section  [ sec - lrhives ] .",
    "these are used in sections  [ sec - stembridge ] and  [ sec - main - result ] , respectively , to prove that all the schur function products and skew schur functions listed in theorems  [ thm - stem ] and  [ thm - main ] are indeed multiplicty - free .",
    "the question of completeness of these lists is tackled in sections  [ sec - stembridge - completeness ] and  [ sec - main - completeness ] , thereby completing the proof of both theorems .",

    "this may be defined by noting first that there exists a symmetric bilinear form @xmath82 on the ring of symmetric functions @xmath83 such that @xmath84 , and then defining @xmath3 by the relations  @xcite @xmath85 for all partitions @xmath11 .    since the littlewood - richardson coefficients @xmath7",

    "this is clearly true on the boundary , since the labels are all parts of partitions .",
    "it is also true of all interior edge labels as may be seen from the following pair of diagrams of an arbitrary lr - hive :    in the first of these diagrams the hive conditions applied to the rhombi of type @xmath156 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 that constitute the corridors between the interior edges with labels @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and the boundary edges with labels @xmath91 , @xmath27 , @xmath92 , respectively , imply that @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",

    "the same hive conditions applied to rhombi of type @xmath156 and @xmath157 imply that @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so that @xmath181 .",

    "we have fixed one interior edge label of the hexagon and the remainder are then fixed as in case ( i ) .",

    "we have shown that the hive model is well suited to the derivation of the two theorems  [ thm - stem ] and  [ thm - main ] on multiplicity - free schur function products and skew schur functions , respectively .",
    "the use of lr - hives has allowed a direct proof that all the cases enumerated in both theorems are indeed multiplicity - free .",
    "in addition it has enabled us to demonstrate that the breakdown of multiplicity - freeness always has a common origin , in the sense that it can be traced back to the existence of a vertex in the relevant lr - hives that is surrounded by an elementary hexagon , none of whose interior edge labels is fixed either by the criteria of lemma  [ lem - hexagon ] or any other means .    the proof offered here of the skew schur function theorem , unlike that of gutschwager  @xcite , is quite independent of stembridge s product of schur functions theorem .",
    "in fact , since the hive model proof has covered simultaneously both connected and disconnected cases , it is possible to recover from theorem  [ thm - main ] not only theorem  [ thm - stem ] but also the following :      v1 : :    @xmath612 is a one - line rectangle and @xmath613    or @xmath614 is a partition ( or vice versa ) ; v2 : :    @xmath612 is a two - line rectangle and @xmath613    or @xmath614 is a fat hook ( or vice versa ) ; v3 : :    @xmath612 is a rectangle and @xmath613 or    @xmath614 is a near - rectangle ( or vice versa ) ; v4 : :    @xmath612 and @xmath613 are rectangles .",

    "then one applies theorem  [ thm - main ] to all those cases for which @xmath42 is of the required disconnected form .",
    "the cases * r0 * are always connected , while each multiplicity - free disconnected case of theorem  [ thm - main ] gives rise through the identity @xmath617 to a corresponding case in this corollary , and _",

    "using   where necessary , it follows that every multiplicity - free skew schur function product is of one or other of the types * v1**v4*. all other cases are not multiplicity - free .    by exactly the same argument",
    ", one can recover theorem  [ thm - stem ] as a further corollary by restricting attention to those cases for which both @xmath612 and @xmath613 are partitions . the correspondence between the multiplicity - free disconnected cases of theorem  [ thm - main ] of the required form and those of theorem  [ thm - stem ]",
    "is given by : @xmath630 ; @xmath631 ; @xmath632 and @xmath633 .",
    "all other cases are not multiplicity - free .",
    "it might , finally , be noted that the extension of these ideas to the determination of multiplicity - free products of schubert classes has already been carried out by gutschwager  @xcite , who reproduced the result of thomas and yong  @xcite . this can be done equally well from our statement of theorem  [ thm - main ] which is well suited to the case of the basic , but possibly disconnected skew diagrams that may arise .    * acknowledgement *  this article is based on work carried out by two of us , dqjd and rlt , in partial fulfilment of study for phd degrees .",
