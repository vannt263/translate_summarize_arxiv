    "in the pre-_swift _ era , only a few early optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were detected , while the observations of x - ray afterglows usually started at @xmath0 seconds after the prompt trigger . since early afterglows contain important information about grb central engines , understanding the early afterglows is therefore one of the most interesting scientific goals of the nasa s _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "after about one year of operations , a significant fraction of well localized grbs have not been detected with early optical emissions down to moderate limiting magnitudes , although the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) on board _ swift _ slewed to the error circle of position quickly after the burst ( roming et al .",
    "on the other hand , observations by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board _ swift _ have revealed several new features of x - ray emissions .",
    "first , steep declines in some x - ray light curves at the transition from prompt phase to afterglow phase have been discovered , which are interpreted as tail emissions of prompt grbs ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al .",
    "secondly , a portion of early x - ray afterglows have shallow - than - normal temporal decays before they enter `` normal '' decaying phase ( nousek et al .",
    "2005 ; zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "thirdly , late x - ray flares have been observed in several grbs ( burrows et al .",
    "2005a ; see also burrows et al .",
    "2005b for a review ) .",
    "piro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also reported that x - ray flares were discovered in a few grbs ( e.g. , grbs 011121 and 011211 ) by the italian - dutch _ beppo_sax satellite .",
    "grbs are usually divided into two main classes by their durations and spectral hardness ratios , i.e. , long grbs have durations larger than 2 seconds and softer spectra while short grbs have durations shorter than 2 seconds and harder spectra ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) . up to now ,",
    "both long grbs , including x - ray rich bursts and a high redshift burst ( grb 050904 ) , and short grbs have been found with late x - ray flares ( galli & piro 2005 ; watson et al .",

    "2005 ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "one leading explanation for the early shallow decaying x - ray afterglows is that the forward external shock has continuous energy injection from the long active central engine ( zhang et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al . 2005 ; dai & lu 1998a ; zhang & 2002 ; dai 2004 ; wei , yan & fan 2005 ) .",
    "another leading explanation is that the lorentz factor of the grb ejecta has a distribution shaped by the central engine so that the behind slower material catches up with the ahead faster material when the latter is decelerated in the circum - burst medium , acting as a continuous energy injection ( zhang et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al . 2005 ; rees & 1998 ; sari & 2000 ; zhang & 2002 ; granot & kumar 2005 ) . in this explanation the central engine",
    "does not need to be active for a long time ( granot & kumar 2005 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the early shallow decaying x - ray afterglows are caused by late continuous energy releases if the grb ejecta is initially dominated by poynting flux ( zhang & kobayashi 2004 ) .    as for x - ray flares , both late external shock model and late internal shock model",
    "have been proposed ( piro et al . 2005 ; burrows et al . 2005 ; fan & wei 2005 ; zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "piro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and galli & piro ( 2005 ) argued for the late external shock model because they found there is no obvious spectral evolution in some x - ray flares , while burrows et al .",
    "( 2005b ) preferred the late internal shock model based on several other x - ray flares which showed opposite features .",
    "these two conclusions are only based on their qualitative and empirical analysis . in this paper",
    "we quantitatively compare the x - ray flares with the predictions of the above two models . in section 2",
    "we describe the intrinsic x - ray light curves from the internal and external shocks .",
    "then we analyze four grbs with x - ray flares in section 3 by comparing with the `` delayed '' ( relative to the grb trigger ) intrinsic light curves of the late internal shock and late external shock . in section 4",
    "we establish four basic types of x - ray light curves , assuming that the central engine has two periods of activities .",
    "we also classify the four grbs by these types .",
    "our discussion and conclusions about x - ray flares are presented in section 5 .",
    "suppose that an intrinsic light curve of the internal / external shock emissions comprises an initial rise and a subsequent decay , which can approximately be described by the following broken power - law function of the observer s time , @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the temporal indices before and after the peak time @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the peak flux density correspondingly .",
    "the fwhm width of the rising and falling time scale of the light curve are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .    in the internal shock model , two shells with a difference in lorentz factor ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 and a time delay @xmath12 by the central engine collide at the radius @xmath13 ( paczynski & xu 1994 ) . during the interaction of these two shells ,",
    "the observed emission flux rises rapidly .",
    "the high time - resolution observations of single - pulse grbs ( e.g. grb 971208 , connaughton et al .",
    "1997 ) and main long pulses in usual grbs reveal that the emission rises linearly with time , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "one should keep in mind that this value is just empirical .",
    "the falling behavior of the light curve is mainly attributed to high - latitude emission ( also known as tail emission ) of the fireball , if the width of the fireball can be neglected ( fenimore , madras & nayakshin 1996 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "let the co - moving flux density @xmath15 be uniform in the fireball , the observed flux density is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the doppler factor and the surface area @xmath18 satisfies @xmath19 ( panaitescu et al .",

    "it should be noted that the observed @xmath34 is @xmath35 in prompt grbs ( norris et al .",

    "if the radial width of the grb ejecta is smaller than a critical value ( thin shell case ) , the peak time @xmath6 is regarded as the deceleration time @xmath42 of the external shock sweeping into the circum - burst medium , driven by the ejecta . on the other hand , if the width of the ejecta is larger than that critical value ( thick shell case ) , @xmath6 is the observed crossing time of the reverse shock through the original grb ejecta , which is about the width divided by the speed of light ( sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "since the typical lorentz factor of electrons in the forward shock is much larger than that in the reverse shock , the x - ray emission in most common cases is dominated by the forward shock ( sari & piran 1999 ; see , however , fan & wei 2005 and kobayashi et al .",
    "2005 , for opposite cases under some extreme assumptions ) .",
    "if the circum - burst environment is an interstellar medium ( ism ) , the reverse shock velocity is newtonian or relativistic depending on whether the initial lorentz factor @xmath43 is smaller or larger than the critical value @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xmath46 is the ism density , @xmath47 erg and @xmath48 cm are the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy and initial width of the ejecta ( zhang , kobayashi & 2003 ) . for the newtonian reverse shock ( nrs )",

    "( ii ) refreshed shock  _",
    "this happens when the time lag between the early and late ejecta by the central engine is quite large , @xmath268 , or the late ejecta has a lower lorentz factor relative to the early ejecta ( @xmath269 ) while the time lag is not large ( @xmath270 ) .",
    "therefore , the collision between these two ejecta happens after the deceleration of the early ejecta .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of the external shock driven by the early ejecta after its deceleration follows the blandford - mckee solution ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , @xmath271 the external shock , or blast wave , can be approximated as a thin shell with a width @xmath272 . when the late ejecta catches up with the tail of the thin shell at @xmath273 , the external shock reaches @xmath274 with a lorentz factor @xmath275 .",
    "in the rest frame of the central engine , the time elapsed since the first ejection by the central engine is @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the speed in units of @xmath278 .",
    "this time can also be estimated by the late ejecta , i.e. , @xmath279 .",
    "equaling these two elapsed times , we obtain @xmath280\\frac{r_{\\rm{col}}}{c}=\\big(t_{\\rm{lag}}-\\frac{3-k}{4-k}t_{{\\rm{dec}},e}\\big),\\ ] ] or @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the observed time since the detection of first photons emitted by the early ejecta and thus is larger than @xmath283 . for @xmath245 , since the second term on the left side of the above equation can always be neglected , the collision happens at @xmath284 which is almost independent on the ratio @xmath285 .",
    "this means that the time when the two ejecta begin to collide detected in the observer s frame directly measures the time lag @xmath228 of these two ejections by the central engine . on the other hand , for @xmath286",
    ", the collision happens at @xmath287 where the critical value of @xmath228 for a given ratio @xmath285 is @xmath288^{1/(3-k)}(\\gamma_{e0}/\\gamma_{l0})^{2(4-k)/(3-k)}t_{{\\rm{dec}},e}$ ] .",
    "therefore , if the late ejecta moves slower than the early ejecta , we can use the collision time @xmath289 to constrain the contrast between the lorentz factors of these two ejecta when @xmath228 is small , or to directly obtain @xmath228 when it is large .",
    "the strength of the collision is dependent on the ratio of @xmath290 to @xmath291 . for the cases of @xmath245 and of @xmath292 while @xmath293 , we obtain @xmath294^{(3-k)/2(4-k)}$ ] , which is larger than @xmath295^{1/2}$ ] . on the other hand , for the case of @xmath292 while @xmath296 , we get @xmath297^{1/2}$ ] . therefore , a violent collision requires the initial lorentz factor of the late ejecta much larger than that of the early ejecta , or the time interval between these ejecta by the central engine long enough ( see also zhang & 2002 ) . a forward shock propagating into the downstream fluid of the external shock and a reverse shock propagating into the late ejecta",
    "are developed during this collision .",
    "since the total energy of the external shock is increased after the two have merged as a whole , the collision is also known as the refreshed shock . to produce an obvious variability , flattening or bump in the afterglow light curve by the refreshed shock",
    "requires that the energy in the late ejecta must be comparable to or larger than that in the early ejecta , or equivalently , in the initial external shock ( kumar & piran 2000 ; zhang & 2002 ) . because the very complicated shock jump conditions arises when considering the forward shock sweeping into a relativistical hot medium , the duration of the whole collision must be calculated numerically , and it is often found to be much longer than @xmath289 in the observer s frame .",
    "typical signatures from refreshed shocks therefore can not be directly used to explain x - ray flares ( see figures in zhang & 2002 ) . however",
    ", these signatures are naturally expected to appear in afterglow light curves after x - ray flares are over and remnants of x - ray flares as late ejecta will collide with the ahead external shock .    _ ( iii ) inner external shock  _ above we take the approximation that the gas in the external shock driven by the early ejecta is compressed into a thin shell with a single bulk lorentz factor .",
    "in fact , according to blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) , the distributions of the lorentz factor @xmath298 and the number density @xmath299 ( in the observer s frame ) of shocked media can be described as simple functions of the self - similar variable @xmath300 , @xmath301 where @xmath302 , @xmath303 is the radial distance of the shocked media to the shock front , and @xmath304 is the circum - burst media density . far behind the shock front , say @xmath305 , a uniform cavity or bubble is shaped with the number density , @xmath306 note that this bubble is cool and quasi - static . the shocked media with @xmath307",
    "is located at @xmath308r_{e}$ ] .",
    "the total mass in the non - relativistic tail of the external shock is @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the mass of swept circum burst media , and the coefficient @xmath311 for @xmath239 and @xmath312 for @xmath240 .",
    "suppose that the late ejecta reaches @xmath313 while still not being decelerated in the non - relativistic tail of the external shock . in the rest frame of the central engine , the time elapsed since the first ejection by the central engine is @xmath276 .",
    "it is also equal to @xmath314 .",

    "this long lag challenges the most popular central engine models for grbs , however , it is supported by recent observations ( e.g. , fox et al . 2005 for an x - ray flare happened at 16 days after the short burst grb 050709 ) .",
    "now we turn to derive the critical value of @xmath290 , i.e. , @xmath323 .",
    "a late ejecta with this critical @xmath290 will be decelerated exactly at @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is the deceleration radius of the late ejecta . using @xmath326 and @xmath327",

    "late ejecta with same @xmath228 but @xmath330 will be decelerated before reaching @xmath313 , i.e. , @xmath331 .",

    "the distance between the outer external shock and the late ejecta when the latter reaches its deceleration radius is always @xmath340 .",
    "similar to the outer external shock , the x - ray emission from the inner external shock peaks at the moment of its deceleration .",
    "the time scale of the peak in the observer s frame is @xmath341 , which is much shorter than the lag time @xmath228 between the inner and outer shocks .",
    "therefore , the observed emission from the inner external shock behaves as a very short spike .",
    "the inner external shock will finally catches up with the main part of the outer external shock .",
    "because the gas just behind each external shock are both hot , strong forward and reverse shocks are hardly to be developed when they begin to collide .    in fig .",
    "3 we visualize the above three types of collision between the early and late ejecta . assuming the properties of the early ejecta are known , the type of collision depends mainly on the ratio of the initial lorentz factor of the late ejecta to that of the early ejecta , @xmath285 , and on the time lag @xmath228 between these two ejections by the central engine .",
    "more details can be found in the caption of fig .",
    "we note that for the refreshed shock , the relative speed of the late ejecta in the rest frame of the outer external shock must be supersonic , i.e. , larger than @xmath342 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to that the relative lorentz factor , which is equal to @xmath343/2 $ ] as long as @xmath290 and @xmath291 much larger than unity , must be greater than @xmath344 ( zhang & 2002 ) .",
    "therefore the criterion for forming a refreshed shock is @xmath345 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "3 that if the refreshed shock is strong , the observed beginning time of the collision directly scales to the time lag by @xmath346t_{\\rm{lag}}$ ] .",
    "this is especially important because only strong refreshed shocks can be easily detected by a brightening or flaring signature in the light curve . in the following",

    "now let us turn to discuss the entire x - ray light curve from the early and late ejecta .",
    "temporal variabilities in at least one of the two ejecta are required to produce the prompt grbs .",
    "there are four basic types of x - ray light curves , depending on the prompt grb emission originating from the early ejecta or from the late ejecta , as well as the collision between the two ejecta taking place earlier than the deceleration of the early ejecta or not .    _ type 1  _",

    "since the light curves of most of observed x - ray flares are less structured , the late ejecta is required to be composed of a few ( two or three ) mini - shells .",
    "a second x - ray flare is unavoidable because of the collision between the early and late ejecta .",

    "we also need a continuous energy injection from @xmath416 s to explain the flattening of the light curve .",
    "grb 050421 definitely belongs to the _ type 1 _ light curve , because the two x - ray flares reside on a @xmath169 emission background , which is the tail emission of the prompt gamma - ray burst .",
    "the first x - ray flare is naturally interpreted as from the internal shock within the late ejecta , while the second x - ray flare is from the subsequent internal shock between the late ejecta and the early ejecta .",

    "the first weaker x - ray flare can be either from the internal shock within the late ejecta , or from the internal shock between the early and late ejecta .",
    "the second large x - ray flare is interpreted as the late external shock emission . however , as discussed in section 3 , the main disadvantage of this late external shock explanation is the theoretical flare increasing factor @xmath428 is much smaller than the observed @xmath429 .",
    "in this paper we have quantitatively analyzed late x - ray flares in the frameworks of the late internal shock model and late external shock model . as we have shown above ,",
    "both the late internal shock model and late external shock model require late time activities of central engines .",
    "some of previous works suggested the late internal shock origin for x - ray flares ( burrows et al .",
    "2005a ; zhang et al .",
    "2005 ; fan & wei 2005 ) , while others suggested the late external shock origin ( piro et al .",
    "2005 ; galli & piro 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , these two kinds of late shocks can coexist within a certain gamma - ray burst .",
    "grb 050607 may be such a possible candidate .    here",
    "one caveat should be made for the late external shock model .",
    "an x - ray flare originating from the late external shock comes to being only if the prompt gamma - ray burst is produced by internal shocks within the early time ejecta , and the late time ejecta carries more energy than the early one and its initial lorentz factor @xmath290 must be larger than the initial lorentz factor of the early ejecta @xmath251 by a factor of @xmath430 , where @xmath228 is the time separation between the two ejecta by the central engine and @xmath243 is the deceleration time of the early ejecta in the circum - burst medium .",
    "the merger of the two ejecta is mainly dominated by the late ejecta with a much shorter deceleration time relative to @xmath243 .",
    "therefore the beginning of the afterglow from the merger happens much later than the prompt grb and the peak of afterglow behaves as an x - ray flare .",
    "note this description of the late internal shock model is different from that in piro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and galli & piro ( 2005 ) .",
    "they attributed the late external shock to arise from a thick shell which is ejected by the long active central engine . despite different descriptions ,",
    "this model requires the @xmath100 effect in the afterglow emission .",
    "given @xmath431 , the smaller the deceleration time of the merger @xmath432 , the more remarkable the afterglow as an x - ray flare .",
    "since @xmath433 , a large energy or especially a large lorentz factor will easily cause an x - ray flare .",
    "this result has also been obtained by galli & piro ( 2005 ) .",
    "theoretically , there are four basic types of x - ray light curves if the central engine has two periods of activities before it entirely ceases . according to our analysis",
    ", the observed x - ray light curves of grbs with x - ray flares all belong to _ type 1 _ or _",
    "type 2_. this means the prompt gamma - ray emissions of these grbs result from the early ejecta , while the late x - ray flares are produced by the internal shock within the late ejecta , by the internal shock between the early and late ejecta , or by the late external shock .",
    "the difference between _ type 1 _ and _ type 2 _ is that for the former the collision between the early and late ejecta happens before the deceleration of the early ejecta , while for the latter the situation is inverse .",
    "one may wonder where are _ type 3 _ and _ type 4 _ x - ray light curves ?",
    "in these two types , the prompt gamma - ray burst is produced from the late ejecta .",
    "there would be no internal shocks within the early ejecta , or these internal shock emission is too weak to be detected .",
    "it is also possible that the internal shock emission within the early ejecta is very weak and regarded as the precursor of the main burst .",
    "according to our classification , _ type 3 _ x - ray light curves correspond to the case that the collision between the early and late ejecta takes place before the deceleration of the early ejecta . the emission from the collision",
    "has a small time lag relative to the prompt gamma - ray emission and can be regarded as the last pulse of the prompt grb .",
    "the afterglow emission in _ type 3 _ hardly suffers the @xmath100 effect .",
    "therefore it is hard to distinguish _ type 3 _ x - ray light curves from the light curves in which the central engine has only one active period . however , _ type 4 _ x - ray light curves may have already been detected .",
    "some of recently discovered x - ray afterglows whose initial decay is extraordinarily slow may originate from this type .",
    "in this paper we also investigate a new kind of collision between the early and late ejecta , the _ inner external shock_. such a shock will be developed when the late ejecta is decelerated by the non - relativistic tail of the outer external shock , which is driven by the early ejecta . to develop the inner external shock",
    "requires the time lag @xmath228 between these two ejecta is very long , typically @xmath434 day , and the baryon loading of the late ejecta is very low , or equivalently , its initial lorentz factor must be larger than a critical value . since the required @xmath228 is not very extreme compared to recent discoveries and the low baryon loading is also plausible , the inner external shock maybe exist .",
    "because the time scale of emission from this shock in the observer s frame is equal to its deceleration time and therefore is much shorter than @xmath228 , the emission behaves as a short spike .",
    "detecting such a spike in the typical afterglow time scale ( @xmath435 day ) is quite difficult .",
    "we therefore just make a prediction of the inner external shock emission in this paper , and have not considered such kind of emission in the above four basic x - ray light curves .",
    "for simplicity we have only considered the central engine having two periods of activities . in reality",
    "the central engine may have more than two periods of activities .",
    "the multiple x - ray flares detected in the high redshift gamma ray burst grb 050904 indicate that the central engine of this burst has been active for many periods ( watson et al .",
    "2005 ; cusumano et al . 2005 ) .",
    "cusumano et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported that the hardness ratio for @xmath436 s is nearly a constant , @xmath437 , which corresponds to @xmath438 .",
    "the x - ray light curves from multiple ejections by the central engine are complicated and difficult to be classified . as for grb 050904 , zou ,",
    "xu & dai ( 2005 ) found that ordered late internal shocks formed by collisions between late ejecta and the earliest ejecta can reproduce the temporal evolution of peak luminosity of x - ray flares and the entire x - ray spectral evolution .",
    "at last we would like to point out other ways besides those developed in this paper ( see section 3 ) to distinguish an x - ray flare caused by a late external shock from other x - ray flares in the same grb by late internal shock(s ) .",
    "as we know in most pulses of grbs it is found that higher energy photons arrive to the observer earlier than lower energy photons ( e.g. , chen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is the spectral - lag phenomenon .",
    "fenimore et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the width @xmath439 of peaks in prompt grbs tends to be narrower at higher photon energy @xmath440 , i.e. , @xmath441 .",
    "this is called the spectral - width relationship .",
    "if these two phenomena have been detected in a particular x - ray flare , then the x - ray flare can be proved to originate from a late internal shock .",
    "statistics help us to understand x - ray flares . in prompt grbs ,",
    "several relationships have been found , such as the isotropic gamma - ray released energy @xmath442 and spectral peak photon energy @xmath443 relationship ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) , the peak luminosity @xmath444 and spectral peak photon energy @xmath443 relationship ( yonetoku et al . 2004 ) , the peak luminosity @xmath444 and spectral time lag @xmath445 relationship ( norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , liang , dai & wu ( 2004 ) found there exists a relationship between the flux and @xmath443 within a grb with time resolved spectra ( see also borgonovo & ryde 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , investigating the above relations in x - ray flares is urgent since it can provide direct evidence that whether late x - ray flares and prompt grbs have the same mechanism .",
