    "thermoelectric ( te ) materials have huge potential for power generation , heat pumping , and refrigeration . however , their practical application is restricted because of the low performance of the te devices compared to traditional fossil fuel power generators and compressor - based refrigerators @xcite .",

    "quantitatively the efficiency of te devices is expressed by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity and absolute temperature , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are phonon and electron contributions to the total thermal conductivity , respectively .",
    "bismuth and antimony tellurides , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , and the alloys based on these materials play a significant role for thermoelectric technology .",
    "already early studies of the ( bi@xmath11,sb@xmath12)te@xmath1 compounds in the late 1950s reported @xmath13 at room temperature @xcite , confirmed by further experiments @xcite .",
    "this value remains , even to date , the maximal one available at room temperature for bulk materials .",

    "these experimental advances motivated extensive theoretical studies of the electronic structure of the bulk bismuth and antimony telluride aimed to understand the possible origin of the increased thermoelectic performance in the multilayered structures .",
    "while in the previous years only few _ ab initio _ band - structure calculations of the bulk bismuth telluride @xcite could be mentioned , in the last decade various aspects of the electronic structure of both pure and doped bulk bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 as well as their transport properties were discussed in ref .",
    "_ ab initio _ studies of the electronic structure and the transport properties of bi@xmath0te@xmath1/sb@xmath0te@xmath1 superlattices were also reported@xcite .",
    "an explanation of directional anisotropy of the transport properties in bi@xmath0te@xmath1/sb@xmath0te@xmath1 superlattices could play a crucial role for the understanding of their increased figure of merit .",
    "et al._@xcite found a strong dependence of the anisotropy of the carrier mobility on both the superlattice period and the relative thickness of the constituents .",
    "the enhancement of the electrical conductivity parallel to the epitaxial growth direction , i.e. the trigonal axis of the rhombohedral lattice of bismuth and antimony tellurides , together with the possibility to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath9 along this direction could provide the desirable zt enhancement .",
    "in this study we concentrate on the anisotropy of the transport properties in the bulk bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 as a first step on a way of understanding the corresponding properties of the bi@xmath0te@xmath1/sb@xmath0te@xmath1 superlattices . since epitaxial growth always implies lattice distortions we included , as discussed below , the effect of the lattice relaxation in our study .",
    "both bismuth and antimony telluride possess the rhombohedral crystal structure with five atoms , i.e. one formula unit , per unit cell belonging to the space group @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "the hexagonal cell contains 15 atoms grouped in the 3 quintuple layers , te1-bi(sb)-te2-bi(sb)-te1 , where te1 and te2 are two different crystal kinds of tellurium atoms .",

    "the description of the realistic crystal structure of the multilayers is out of the scope of this study .",
    "nonetheless , we modeled bi@xmath0te@xmath1 with the experimental lattice parameters and interatomic distances of sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , and vice versa .",
    "since both materials have very similar lattice parameter @xmath28 along @xmath29-axis this variation is essentially compression and extension of the lattice in ( @xmath30 ) plane for bismuth and antimony telluride , respectively .",
