    "johansen s ( 1988 , 1991 ) likelihood ratio ( lr ) test for cointegration rank is a very popular econometric technique .",
    "however , it is rarely applied to systems of more than three or four variables . on the other hand",
    ", there exist many applications involving much larger systems .",
    "for example , davis ( 2003 ) discusses a possibility of applying the test to the data on seven aggregated and individual commodity prices to test lewbel s ( 1996 ) generalization of the hicks - leontief composite commodity theorem . in a recent study of exchange rate predictability , engel , mark , and west ( 2015 )",
    "contemplate a possibility of determining the cointegration rank of a system of seventeen oecd exchange rates .",
    "banerjee , marcellino , and osbat ( 2004 ) emphasize the importance of testing for no cross - sectional cointegration in panel cointegration analysis ( see breitung and pesaran ( 2008 ) and choi ( 2015 ) ) , and the cross - sectional dimension of modern macroeconomic panels can easily be as large as forty .",
    "the main reason why the lr test is rarely used in the analysis of relatively large systems is its poor finite sample performance . even for small systems ,",
    "the test based on the asymptotic critical values does not perform well ( see johansen ( 2002 ) ) . for large systems , the size distortions become overwhelming , leading to severe over - rejection of the null in favour of too much cointegration  as shown in many simulation studies , including ho and sorensen ( 1996 ) and gonzalo and pitarakis ( 1995 , 1999 ) .    in this paper , we study the asymptotic behavior of the sample canonical correlations that the lr statistic is based on , when the number of observations and the system s dimensionality go to infinity simultaneously and proportionally . we show that the empirical distribution of the squared sample canonical correlations almost surely converges to the so - called _",
    "wachter distribution _ which also arises , albeit with different parameters , as the limit of the empirical distribution of the squared sample canonical correlations between two independent high - dimensional white noises ( see wachter ( 1980 ) ) .",
    "our analytical findings explain the observed over - rejection of the null hypothesis by the lr test , shed new light on the workings and limitations of the bartlett - type correction approach to the problem ( see johansen ( 2002 ) ) , and lead us to propose a very simple graphical device , similar to the scree plot , for a preliminary analysis of the validity of cointegration hypotheses in large vector autoregressions .",
    "the basic framework for our analysis is standard . consider a @xmath0-dimensional var in the error correction form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are vectors of deterministic terms and zero - mean gaussian errors with unconstrained covariance matrix , respectively .",
    "the lr statistic for the test of the null hypothesis of no more than @xmath4 cointegrating relationships between the @xmath0 elements of @xmath5 against the alternative of more than @xmath4 such relationships is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sample size , and @xmath8 are the squared sample canonical correlation coefficients between residuals in the regressions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the lagged differences @xmath11 @xmath12 and the deterministic terms .    in the absence of the lagged differences and deterministic terms ,",
    "the @xmath13 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the sample covariance matrices of @xmath9 and @xmath17 respectively , while @xmath18 is the cross sample covariance matrix .",
    "more substantively , @xmath19 is the largest possible squared sample correlation coefficient between arbitrary linear combinations of the entries of @xmath9 and the entries of @xmath17 @xmath20 is the largest squared correlation among linear combinations restricted to be orthogonal to those yielding @xmath19 , and so on ( see muirhead ( 1982 ) , ch .",
    "johansen ( 1991 ) shows that the asymptotic distribution of @xmath21 under the asymptotic regime where @xmath22 while @xmath0 remains fixed , can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix whose entries are explicit functions of a @xmath23-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "unfortunately , for relatively large @xmath0 , this asymptotics does not produce good finite sample approximations , as evidenced by the over - rejection phenomenon mentioned above .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we consider a _ simultaneous _ asymptotic regime @xmath24 where both @xmath0 and @xmath7 diverge to infinity so that @xmath25   , \\label{asymptotic regime}\\ ] ] while @xmath0 remains no larger than @xmath7 .",
    "our monte carlo analysis shows that the corresponding asymptotic approximations are relatively accurate even for such small sample sizes as @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    the basic specification for the data generating process ( [ model ] ) that we consider has @xmath28 .",
    "in the next section , we discuss extensions to more general vars with low - rank @xmath29 matrices and additional common factor terms .",
    "we also explain there that our main results hold independently from whether a deterministic vector @xmath2 with fixed or slowly - growing dimension is present or absent from the var .",
    "our study focuses on the behavior of the empirical distribution function ( d.f . ) of the squared sample canonical correlations,@xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the indicator function .",
    "we find that , under the null of @xmath4 cointegrating relationships , as @xmath24 while @xmath32 almost surely ( a.s . ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the weak convergence of d.f.s ( see billingsley ( 1995 ) , p.191 ) , and @xmath35 denotes the _",
    "wachter _ d.f . with parameters",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the _ wachter distribution _ was derived by wachter ( 1980 ) as the limit of the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of the multivariate beta matrix of growing dimension and degrees of freedom .",
    "it has a simple density , which is introduced in the next section , and , for @xmath38 and/or @xmath39 point masses at zero and/or one , respectively .",
    "weak convergence ( [ convergence ] ) and the fact that the squared sample canonical correlations are no larger than unity imply the a.s . convergence of averages @xmath40 for any @xmath41 which is bounded and continuous on @xmath42   $ ] . by definition ,",
    "the likelihood ratio statistic scaled by @xmath43 has this form ( with omitted first @xmath4 summands ) , where @xmath44 is continuous but unbounded function .",
    "therefore , ( [ convergence ] ) can guarantee an a.s .",
    "asymptotic lower bound for the scaled lr statistic . for the lr statistic scaled by @xmath45 we have , almost surely,@xmath46    in contrast , we show that , under the ( standard ) asymptotic regime where@xmath22 while @xmath0 is held fixed@xmath47 @xmath48 concentrates around @xmath49 for relatively large @xmath0 . )",
    ", our weak convergence results only guarantee that @xmath50 is a lower bound , but we conjecture that it is also the limit of the scaled lr statistic as first @xmath22 and then @xmath51 .",
    "this conjecture is supported by monte carlo evidence . ]",
    "a direct calculation reveals that @xmath49 is smaller than the lower bound ( [ bound ] ) , for all @xmath52 , with the gap growing as @xmath53 increases .",
    "that is , the standard asymptotic distribution of the lr statistic is centered at a too low level , especially for relatively large @xmath0 .",
    "this explains the tendency of the asymptotic lr test to over - reject the null .",
    "the reason for the poor centering delivered by the standard asymptotic approximation is that it classifies terms @xmath54 in the asymptotic expansion of the likelihood ratio statistic as @xmath55 when @xmath0 is relatively large , such terms can substantially contribute to the finite sample distribution of the statistic , but will be ignored as asymptotically negligible .",
    "in contrast , the _ simultaneous _ _ asymptotics _ classifies all terms @xmath54 as @xmath56 they are not ignored asymptotically , which improves the centering of the simultaneous asymptotic approximation relative to the standard one .",
    "it is possible to use bound ( [ bound ] ) , with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath57 , to construct a bartlett - type correction factor for the standard lr test .",
    "as we show below , for @xmath58 the value of such a theoretical correction factor is very close to the simulation - based factor described in johansen , hansen and fachin ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , for larger @xmath57 , the values diverge , which may be caused by the fact that johansen , hansen and fachin s ( 2005 ) simulations do not consider combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath7 with @xmath59 and the functional form that they use to fit the simulated correction factors does not work well uniformly in @xmath57 .    the weak convergence result ( [ convergence ] )",
    "can be put to a more direct use by comparing the quantiles of the empirical distribution of the squared sample canonical correlations with the quantiles of the limiting wachter distribution . under the null",
    ", the former quantiles plotted against the latter ones should form a 45@xmath60 line , asymptotically .",
    "deviations of such a wachter quantile - quantile plot from the line indicate violations of the null .",
    "creating wachter plots requires practically no additional computations beyond those needed to compute the lr statistic , and we propose to use this simple graphical device for a preliminary analysis of cointegration in large vars .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our study is the first to derive the limit of the empirical d.f . of the squared sample canonical correlations between random walk @xmath10 and its innovations @xmath9 .",
    "wachter ( 1980 ) shows that @xmath35 is the weak limit of the empirical d.f . of the squared sample canonical correlations between @xmath61- and @xmath62-dimensional independent gaussian white noises with the size of the sample @xmath63",
    "when @xmath64 so that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "yang and pan ( 2012 ) show that wachter s ( 1980 ) result holds without the gaussianity assumption for i.i.d .",
    "data with finite second moments .",
    "our proofs do not rely on those previous results .",
    "the values of parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 in ( [ convergence ] ) imply that the limiting d.f .",
    "for the case of @xmath7 observations of @xmath0-dimensional random walk and its innovations , that we consider in this paper , is the same as the limiting d.f . for the case of @xmath67 observations of two independent white noises - one @xmath0-dimensional and the other @xmath68-dimensional .",
    "it is tempting to think that there exists a deep connection between the two cases , even though we were unable to uncover it so far .",
    "our paper opens up a new direction for the asymptotic analysis of panel var cointegration tests based on the sample canonical correlations .",
    "one such test is developed in larsson and lyhagen ( 2007 ) .",
    "it generalizes larsson , lyhagen , and lothgren ( 2001 ) and groen and kleibergen ( 2003 ) by allowing for cross - unit cointegration , which is important from the empirical perspective .",
    "larsson and lyhagen ( 2007 ) are reluctant to recommend their test for large vars and suggest that for the analysis of relatively large panels it may be better to rely on tighter parameterized models , such as that of bai and ng ( 2004 ) . in the recent review of the panel cointegration literature , choi ( 2015 )",
    "expresses a related concern that , with the large number of cross - sectional units , larsson and lyhagen s test may not work well even with the bartlett s correction .",
    "we speculate that the larsson - lyhagen test , as well as johansen s lr test , based on the _ simultaneous _ asymptotics would work well in panels with comparable cross - sectional and temporal dimensions .",
    "the results of this paper can be used to describe only the appropriate centering of the corresponding test statistics .",
    "the next step would be to derive the _ simultaneous _ asymptotic distribution of scaled deviations of such statistics from the centering values .",
    "we conjecture that the _ simultaneous _ asymptotic distribution of @xmath21 is gaussian , as is often the case for averages of regular functions of eigenvalues of large random matrices ( see bai and silverstein ( 2010 ) and paul and aue ( 2014 ) ) .",
    "we are currently undertaking work to validate this conjecture .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we prove the convergence of @xmath69 to the _ wachter _ d.f . and",
    "use this result to derive the asymptotic lower bound for @xmath70 section 3 derives the sequential limit of the empirical d.f . of the squared sample canonical correlations as , first @xmath22 and then @xmath51 .",
    "it then uses differences between the obtained sequential asymptotic limit and the simultaneous limit derived in section 2 to explain the over - rejection phenomenon , and to design a theoretical bartlett - type correction factor for the lr statistic in high - dimensional vars .",
    "section 4 contains a monte carlo study that confirms good finite sample properties of the wachter asymptotic approximation .",
    "it also illustrates the proposed wachter quantile - quantile plot technique using a relatively high - dimensional macroeconomic panel .",

    "we shall assume that model ( [ econometricians model ] ) may be misspecified in the sense that the true data generating process is described by the following generalization of ( [ model])@xmath84 where @xmath85 @xmath86 are still i.i.d .",
