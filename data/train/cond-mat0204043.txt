    "in the last several years , considerable theoretical progress has been made in understanding the possibility of fractional quantum numbers for the excitations of strongly interacting systems .",
    "a particular focus of attention has been on realizing such phases in quantum spin systems in two spatial dimensions@xcite . in conventional quantum phases of spin-@xmath1 magnets , such as an antiferromagnet or a spin - peierls phase ,",
    "the spin excitations carry quantum numbers @xmath2 or higher multiples .",
    "in contrast , in a fractionalized phase , there are excitations ( dubbed spinons ) that carry spin @xmath0 .",
    "various kinds of evidence for the presence of such fractionalized phases in spin models on a number of diverse lattices have been presented in ref .  .",
    "a detailed theoretical study@xcite of fractionalization in two dimensions has revealed that in the simplest cases such spinon excitations are necessarily accompanied by gapped `` vortex''-like excitations : visons .",
    "the visons carry no spin but have a long - range statistical interaction with the spinon : when a spinon is taken all the way around a vison , the wave function of the system changes sign .",
    "thus the visons have an ising - like character : two visons can annihilate each other and are equivalent to no vison at all . a concise mathematical description of this long ranged statistical interaction is given by assigning a @xmath3 gauge charge to the spinons and a corresponding @xmath3 gauge flux to the visons .",
    "a precise theoretical characterization@xcite of fractionalized phases serving to distinguish them from more conventional phases is provided by the notion of topological order  a concept elucidated by wen@xcite in his work on the quantum hall effect . when placed on a manifold with a non - trivial topology ,",
    "a fractionalized phase has a number of locally similar but globally distinct states that differ by whether or not a vison threads each hole of the manifold .",
    "if a spin model possesses a fractionalized phase , what does its wave function look like in terms of the original spins ? in this paper , we argue that the wave functions describing a fractionalized state may be obtained from the original rvb construction of anderson@xcite .",
    "we consider states obtained by projecting the wave function of a bcs superconductor ( on a lattice ) to the hilbert space of exactly one electron per site ( this procedure is also known as gutzwiller projection@xcite ) .",
    "different topological sectors are obtained by projecting states with / without superconducting vortices ( or , equivalently , with different boundary conditions ) .",
    "we motivate this construction from the field - theoretic description of fractionalized phases .",
    "projected wave functions have long been studied@xcite to gain insight into the properties of the cuprate materials .",
    "however , as we show below , it is not guaranteed that the resulting wave function describes any fractionalized phase .",
    "the state that has been the subject of most attention is the `` @xmath4-wave rvb state '' obtained by projecting a bcs @xmath5 superconductor with nearest neighbor hopping and nearest neighbor pairing interactions .",
    "we argue below that such a superconducting state has some special symmetry properties due to which it is _ not _ expected to lead to a fractionalized state after projection ( at half - filling ) .",
    "we confirm this by a direct numerical calculation on this state .",
    "it is not clear whether the nearest neighbor @xmath4-wave rvb state represents a good trial wave function for _ any _ stable phase of a spin system .",
    "addition of a number of perturbations , such as for instance next - nearest - neighbor hopping , to the nearest - neighbor @xmath4-wave superconductor removes the special symmetry properties  the resulting state is then expected to lead , after projection , to a fractionalized state .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly the topological order in such projected states . a closely related state",
    "was recently considered in ref .   at finite doping and was argued to provide a good description of cuprate phenomenology .",
    "we note that recent experiments@xcite place constraints on the applicability of fractionalization ideas to the cuprates . theoretical description of the cuprates with wave functions corresponding to fractionalized states must hence be performed with caution and examined for consistency with experiments .",
    "recently , a particular projected state has been argued to represent the ground state of the @xmath6 heisenberg model on the square lattice@xcite .",
    "we argue that such a state is also expected to have topological order , and hence be fractionalized .",
    "we explicitly construct four globally distinct states on the torus to demonstrate the topological order .",
    "if the projection does indeed lead to a fractionalized state , then we may construct wave functions for its excitations as follows .",
    "the distinct excitations of a superconductor are the bcs quasiparticles and the vortices .",
    "as originally suggested by anderson@xcite , projection of the bcs quasiparticles directly leads to the spinons .",
    "we argue that the visons may be obtained by projecting the wave function of the bcs @xmath7 vortex .",
    "this observation may be directly exploited to check for topological order in the projected wave functions .",
    "consider putting the system on a torus .",
    "we may project the four superconducting states obtained by threading or not threading a @xmath7 vortex through each hole of the torus .",
    "if the projected state is fractionalized , and hence topologically ordered , these four states must be ( after projection ) orthogonal to each other in the thermodynamic limit though they are locally similar .",
    "the original point of view on the gutzwiller projected wave function@xcite is that it describes a state obtained by quantum disordering a heisenberg neel antiferromagnet . however , as gutzwiller projection ( at half filling ) freezes out the charge fluctuations inherent in the unprojected superconducting state , it may equally well be viewed as describing a state obtained by quantum disordering a superconductor .",
    "recent theoretical work@xcite has sought to understand the properties of mott insulators by viewing them as quantum disordered superconductors . in this approach ,",
    "insulating phases are regarded as condensates of the vortices of the superconductor .",
    "a fractionalized mott insulator is obtained by pairing and condensing the bcs vortices while the unpaired @xmath7 vortex remains gapped . at energy scales well below the charge gap ,",
    "the excitations in such a mott insulator are the spinon and the vison .",
    "the spinons are precisely what become of the fermionic bcs quasiparticles once the @xmath8 vortices condense .",
    "the vison on the other hand is the remnant of the unpaired @xmath7 vortex - due to the @xmath8 condensate , this survives with only a @xmath3 character .",
    "it is clear that this point of view fits in nicely with the idea of gutzwiller projecting superconducting states to obtain wave functions for mott insulators .",
    "however not all choices of the unprojected superconducting state are guaranteed to lead to fractionalized states on projection ( see sections below ) . in this section",
    ", we discuss the nature of projected vortex states and their use in constructing the wave function of the vison .",
    "we begin by quickly reviewing the interpretation of the gutzwiller - projected superconducting state as a resonating valence bond wave function .",
    "consider the ground state of a bcs hamiltonian on a @xmath9 square lattice ( @xmath10 even ) : [ hamiltonian ] h = -_ij _ t_ij c^_ic_j + h.c .",
    "ij c^_i c^_j + h.c .",
    "its wave function has the form = _ k ( u_k + v_k c^_k c^_-k ) [ bcs - wavefunction ] in standard notation .",
    "we restrict attention to spin - singlet , time - reversal - invariant ground states that also preserve all the symmetries of the lattice . the vectors @xmath11 take values in the first brillouin zone .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in both spatial directions so that @xmath12 with @xmath13 integers ( the system may be thought of as residing on a torus ) .",
    "we may rewrite this wave function as ( _ k g(k ) c^_k c^_-k ) with @xmath14 .",
    "so long as @xmath15 , this state is guaranteed to be a spin singlet",
    ".    it will be useful to consider a first quantized version @xmath16 obtained by fixing the total number of particles to be @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 are the position and spin state of the @xmath19th electron .",
    "we have ( \\{x_i , _ i } ) ( _ k g_k c^_k c^_-k ) ^l^2/2 the wave function @xmath20 is single - valued on the torus .    the gutzwiller - projected state @xmath21 is obtained by projecting @xmath22 further onto a subspace where there is exactly one particle per lattice site .",
    "the resulting wave function may be written as a sum over various valence - bond configurations on the lattice : = p_g _ vbc a_vbc where @xmath23 denotes any particular valence bond covering .",
    "@xmath24 is the corresponding amplitude and is given by the product of @xmath25 over all valence bonds connecting sites @xmath26 appearing in the state @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath27 introduced above .",
    "if the ground state of a spin system is correctly described by gutzwiller projecting a bcs state , it is natural to construct excitations of the spin system by similarly projecting the excitations of the bcs superconductor . as argued by anderson ,",
    "projecting the bcs quasiparticle state leads to a wave function for neutral spin-@xmath1 spinons .",
    "the other distinct excitations of the superconductor are the vortices .",
    "what happens to these under the gutzwiller projection ? to answer this question , consider a wave function of a superconductor describing a state where a @xmath28 vortex threads the torus along the @xmath29-direction .",
    "if @xmath30 is even , the ( first - quantized ) wave function may be taken simply as _",
    "n_x = ( _ i ) where @xmath31 is the angular coordinate of the @xmath19th particle .",
    "thus , the vortex wave function for even @xmath30 may be simply obtained by multiplying the ground state wave function by a phase factor ( which depends on the configuration of the particles ) . upon gutzwiller projection , there is one particle at every site ; consequently the projected vortex state ( for @xmath30 even ) is _ trivially _ related to the projected ground state by an overall phase factor .",
    "thus the projected even vortex state does not lead to a distinct state of the spin system .",
    "for @xmath30 odd , the vortex wave function in the superconductor is not obtained by simply multiplying the ground state by a phase factor .",
    "consider @xmath32 . the naive guess ( _ i ) violates the physical requirement that all legitimate electron wave functions must be single - valued on the torus .",
    "the correct wave function is constructed by multiplying by the phase factor above , _ and _ replacing @xmath22 by a wave function that satisfies antiperiodic boundary conditions along the @xmath33-direction ( and periodic along the @xmath29-direction ) .",
    "such a replacement may be obtained by considering the ground state of @xmath34 with antiperiodic boundary conditions along the @xmath33-direction : = _ k ( u_k + v_kc^_k c^_-k ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 as before . multiplying by the phase factor above has the effect of shifting all the momenta by @xmath37 along the @xmath33-direction .",
    "a legitimate @xmath7 vortex state may therefore be constructed as = _ k ( u_k + v_kc^_k + c^_-k ) it is readily verified that this is a spin - singlet wave function . the first quantized @xmath7 vortex wave function ( with @xmath17 particles ) may now be obtained straightforwardly as  ( _ x , x g(x , x ) c^_(x)c^_(x ) ) ^l^2/2 with g(x , x ) & = & e^i ( y + y)g_a.p(x - x ) , + g_a.p(x -x ) & = & _ kg(k)e^ik. ( x - x ) + & = & _ kg(k ) ( k. ( x - x ) ) here , as before , @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath39 satisfies antiperiodic boundary conditions along the @xmath33 direction , and periodic along the @xmath29 direction : g_a.p(r + l ) & = & -g_a.p(r ) + g_a.p(r +",
    "l ) & = & g_a.p(r ) this vortex state may now be projected to obtain the new rvb wave function given by = p_g _ vbc a_vbc the amplitude @xmath40 is given by the product of @xmath41 over all valence bonds connecting sites @xmath19 and @xmath42 appearing in the state @xmath23 .",
    "this wave function can be further simplified by noting that the factor @xmath43 arises in every term on the right - hand side and is just a trivial multiplication by an overall phase factor , and hence may be dropped .",
    "( for an @xmath9 square lattice with @xmath10 even , this phase factor is simply equal to one ) .",
    "this then amounts to gutzwiller projecting the state @xmath44 obtained by changing the boundary conditions on the unprojected state .",
    "the resulting amplitude for a valence bond @xmath26 is given by @xmath45 .",
    "thus the projection of a @xmath7 vortex potentially survives as a non - trivial state in the spin system . in view of the discussion at the beginning of this section , it is clear that if the ground state described by @xmath21 is indeed fractionalized , then @xmath46 describes a state with a vison threaded through along the @xmath29-direction",
    ". we will exploit this observation below to check for topological order in the projected wave functions .",
    "it is instructive to make a short digression , and specialize to superconducting states which are fully gapped , and where the function @xmath47 has a very short range of order a few lattice spacings . in that case",
    ", the resulting rvb wave function describes a state with only short ranged valence bonds ( and presumably a full spin gap ) .",
    "for such a state , it is expected that the function @xmath27 is smooth in @xmath11-space so that we may approximate @xmath48 . in real space , this amounts to g_a.p(x - x ) g(x - x ) ( ( y - y ) ) in the limit of large @xmath10 , the cosine factor is one everywhere except for valence bonds that connect sites to the left of @xmath49 to sites to the right of @xmath50 for which it is @xmath51 .",
    "thus the difference between the projected ground state and the projected @xmath7 state may be summarized as follows : consider drawing a vertical line parallel to the @xmath29-direction that cuts all the links of the lattice between @xmath49 and @xmath52 . in the projected vortex state , the amplitude for any valence bond that cuts this line acquires a factor @xmath53 relative to the ground state . in other words , the amplitude for any valence bond configuration where an odd number of valence bonds intersect this line is @xmath53 relative to the ground state .",
    "we note that this construction of the projected vortex wave function reduces to the state considered by read and chakraborty in their pioneering early work@xcite on topological order in rvb wave functions . unfortunately ,",
    "as already recognized in that paper@xcite it is not clear that the particular rvb state discussed there describes any stable phase of a spin system .",
    "an approximate description of a short ranged rvb state is through a quantum dimer model@xcite .",
    "it is well - known@xcite that the quantum dimer model on a torus has four distinct topological sectors classified by whether the number of dimers intersecting particular lines similar to the one introduced above is even or odd .",
    "fractionalization in the original spin model is signalled by topological order in the quantum dimer model when the four topological sectors become degenerate in energy . in this case",
    ", these even / odd sectors clearly correspond to the symmetric / antisymmetric combination of the state with no vison and a threaded vison .",
    "this is completely consistent with our construction of the vison wave function by projecting the @xmath7 vortex .",
    "our primary interest in this paper will be long - ranged rvb states where the spinons are gapless .",
    "we will explore the properties of wave functions for such states by numerical calculations using the construction above .",
    "though the projected @xmath7 vortex survives as a non - trivial state of the spin system , it is still not necessary that the state @xmath21 has topological order .",
    "the presence or lack thereof of topological order may be established by examining the following two conditions :    * ( i ) * @xmath54 as the system size goes to infinity , and    * ( ii ) * the expectation values of all local physical operators be the same in both states @xmath21 and @xmath46 again in the thermodynamic limit .    the first condition is closely related to the presence of a vison gap in the bulk .",
    "indeed , the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 differ by one vison tunneled across the cylinder ( or torus ) , and therefore @xmath57 may be interpreted as the amplitude of such a tunneling event .",
    "the second condition guarantees that the distinction between the states is not in any local properties but rather in global ones . in this section",
    ", we will examine some simple arguments that motivate the choice of particular superconducting wave functions which will lead to fractionalized states on projection .",
    "consider the first condition .",
    "it is easy to check that the overlap @xmath58 goes to zero very rapidly as @xmath10 becomes large .",
    "this is expected physically as the vorticity is a good quantum number for the unprojected bcs state .",
    "however , this does _ not _ guarantee @xmath59 due to the projection . to get better insight into what is needed for condition ( i ) to be satisfied",
    ", we will employ the following useful characterization of the gutzwiller projection . in the unprojected hilbert space ,",
    "the states at each site are @xmath60 in obvious notation .",
    "projection keeps only the states @xmath61 at each site . at each site",
    "@xmath19 , introduce the physical spin operator @xmath62 and the pseudo - spin operator @xmath63 : s_i & = & c^_i c_i + t^z_i & = & + t^+_i & = & c^_ic^_i + t^-_i & = & c_ic_i here @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath63 satisfy @xmath65 commutation relations just like the physical spin operators @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , all components of @xmath63 commute with all components of @xmath66 .",
    "clearly the states @xmath61 are singlets under the pseudo - spin rotation generated by the @xmath63 , while the states @xmath67 form a doublet under the pseudospin rotation .",
    "thus the gutzwiller projection is equivalent to projection onto the singlet sector ( at each site ) of the pseudospin @xmath65 rotation .",
    "this has the general implication p_g = p_g u for an arbitrary @xmath65 rotation u = e^i_i _ i .",
    "t_i [ su2-rotation ] where the parameters @xmath68 may be chosen independently on each site .",
    "thus a local pseudospin @xmath65 rotation of the unprojected state does not change the state after projection .",
    "we will therefore call this a gauge rotation .    in view of the above ,",
    "a sufficient condition for the orthogonality of @xmath21 and @xmath46 is simply [ orcrt1 ] bcs|u|bcs = 0 for any arbitrary pseudospin @xmath65 rotation ( [ su2-rotation ] ) .",
    "( we note that this is not in general a _ necessary _ condition for the orthogonality ) .",
    "the discussion has so far been general .",
    "( [ orcrt1 ] ) imposes some conditions on the nature of the bcs state which could lead to a wave function for a fractionalized state after projection .",
    "however eqn .",
    "( [ orcrt1 ] ) is still not in a form which is directly useful in providing guidance in writing down such states . to get a more useful form , we specialize to a particular class of unprojected states . in general",
    ", the state @xmath69 will be a linear superposition of states with different total particle number .",
    "on the other hand , the projected state @xmath21 has exactly one particle per site , and hence an exact total of @xmath17 particles on a lattice with @xmath17 sites .",
    "now , for a general bcs state , if we plot the probability distribution of having a total of @xmath30 particles , it will have a sharp peak at some average value @xmath70 and will die rapidly for @xmath71 large . if @xmath70 is different from @xmath17 , then the gutzwiller projection picks out the tails of the original bcs wave function . in this case , the projected wave function may have very little to do with the unprojected one .",
    "for the projected state to retain the significant features of the spin physics of the unprojected state , it is clearly advantageous@xcite to require that the mean number of particles ( before projection ) is @xmath17 .",
    "if this is satisfied , the projection will have a gentler effect than if the mean number is different from one per site . to further soften the effect of the projection , it is clearly advantageous to require that the mean number be one for _ every _ unprojected state obtained from @xmath69 by a pseudospin @xmath65 gauge rotation .",
    "this ensures that the projection does not pick up the tails of the wave function in any gauge .",
    "the requirement that the average electron number on each site is one may be simply written as t_i^z = 0 on all sites @xmath19 .",
    "further the requirement that this be true for every gauge - rotated ground state is equivalent to requiring that [ mfcstr ] t_i = 0 , i.e.  the average values of the generators of the gauge rotations vanish .    from now on",
    ", we will specialize to unprojected states where the requirement eqn .",
    "( [ mfcstr ] ) is satisfied . in this case",
    ", we may hope that we can use our intuition about the unprojected state to infer the properties of the projected state . when do we expect that eqn .",
    "( [ orcrt1 ] ) will be satisfied for such a bcs state ?",
    "note that @xmath72 differs from @xmath69 in having a @xmath7 vortex threaded through the hole of the cylinder .",
    "if the ground state of a physical system is given by the superconducting state @xmath69 , we can label it s excitations by their total vorticity quantum number .",
    "the state @xmath72 has total vorticity @xmath73 compared to @xmath69 , and hence is orthogonal .",
    "however , so long as @xmath74 is also a superconducting state , it will also have a fixed vorticity which differs from that of @xmath72 by an odd number .",
    "consequently , in this case eqn .",
    "( [ orcrt1 ] ) will be satisfied . if however for some @xmath75 , the gauge rotated state @xmath74 is not a superconducting state , then it may be regarded as a coherent superposition of electron wave functions each of which carry a definite vorticity .",
    "( the vorticity is not a good quantum number in a non - superconducting state ) .",
    "it is then possible that @xmath72 is not orthogonal to that particular gauge rotated state , so that eqn .",
    "( [ orcrt1 ] ) is not satisfied . at the very least ,",
    "we lose the general reason requiring orthogonality .    based on the reasoning above",
    ", we make the following conjecture :    _ an unprojected state where the constraint _ ( [ mfcstr ] ) _ is satisfied , and which can not be rotated to a non - superconducting state by an @xmath65 gauge rotation , will lead to a topologically ordered state after projection_.    this conjecture provides strong motivation for choosing particular superconducting states that we may project to obtain topologically ordered states . on the other hand , we do not provide any formal proof of this conjecture in this paper .",
    "it is supported by the reasoning in this section , and by our numerical results .",
    "here we need to make a clear distinction between `` superconducting '' and `` non - superconducting '' states .",
    "formally , we call a state `` gauge - equivalent to non - superconducting '' if it is invariant under a global @xmath76 subgroup of the full group of gauge rotations ( [ su2-rotation ] ) .",
    "indeed , a non - superconducting state is characterized by a fixed number of electrons .",
    "then the @xmath76 group of _ global _ rotations by @xmath77 ( i.e. , the subgroup generated by the sets @xmath78 ) produces only trivial multiplications by phase factors leaving the state invariant .",
    "we call such a state a `` @xmath76 state '' [ or even a `` @xmath65 state '' in the case when the maximal subgroup leaving the unprojected state invariant is @xmath65 ] . in this terminology , a state that is superconducting in any gauge",
    "is called a `` @xmath3 state '' .",
    "this classification is a sub - classification of a more detailed one introduced by wen@xcite .",
    "a set of conditions for the @xmath76 invariance ( being gauge - equivalent to non - superconducting ) of a given state may be formally written in terms of projector operators onto occupied quasiparticle states .",
    "consider the set of bogoliubov  degennes doublets @xmath80 participating in the ground state ( [ bcs - wavefunction ] ) .",
    "we can define a projector onto the linear subspace spanned by those doublets . in real space , this projector may be thought of as a set of @xmath81 matrices @xmath82 labeled by the site indices @xmath19 and @xmath42 and defined as p_ij = _ k under the @xmath65 gauge transformation , these matrices transform as p_ij u_i p_iju^_j for a non - superconducting state , all matrices @xmath82 are simultaneously diagonal . to see when a given state can be gauge rotated to such a non - superconducting state",
    ", it is useful to consider the chain products of such matrices starting and ending at the same point @xmath19 : [ defac ] a_i[c ] = _ c ( p_ij p_jk ",

    ", one may perform a similar test for the _ hamiltonian _ ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can be rotated to a non - superconducting one ( _ i.e _ containing no pairing terms ) if and only if = 0 , [ b - condition ] for all @xmath19 and @xmath86 , where b_i[c ] = _ c ( h_ij h_jk ",
    "h_li ) , h_ij= [ hij ] this is a convenient _ sufficient _ condition for being a @xmath76 wave function , but not a necessary one : in certain cases , a superconducting hamiltonian may have a non - superconducting ground state ( with a definite particle number ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider some specific examples of superconducting states to see how these conditions work in practice .",
    "consider for instance a nearest neighbor @xmath4-wave superconductor where @xmath89 are non - zero only on nearest - neighbor bonds , and take the values t_ij & = & t + _ ij & = & .",
    "the plus sign in the second equation is for horizontal bonds , and the minus sign for vertical bonds .",
    "it is readily seen that the condition in eqn .",
    "( [ mfcstr ] ) is satisfied by this state .",
    "however , as is also easily seen , all the @xmath90 $ ] commute for this state .",
    "this is of course consistent with the well - known fact that this state can be gauge rotated to a pure hopping state ( known as the staggered flux state ) .",
    "we therefore expect that this state will not lead to a fractionalized state after projection .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical calculations below .",
    "now consider adding the next - near - neighbor diagonal hopping @xmath91 to this state .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian still describes a @xmath5 superconductor .",
    "however , a simple calculation shows that there are two non - commuting @xmath90 $ ] matrices so that this can no longer be rotated to pure hopping .",
    "addition of @xmath91 changes the mean density away from one particle per site .",
    "this can however be compensated by adding an on - site chemical potential term to the unprojected hamiltonian .",
    "the state thus constructed is therefore a good candidate for projecting to get a wave function for a fractionalized state .",
    "below , in section [ num ] we demonstrate this by a numerical calculation .",
    "surprisingly , the criteria obtained above for the superconducting state to describe a topologically ordered state after projection may also be motivated from a completely different point of view@xcite . consider any spin @xmath0 model in two dimensions . as is well - known , it is possible to use a representation of the spins in terms of fermionic spin-@xmath1 operators .",
    "this representation is exact so long as the constraint that the fermion occupation is one at each site is imposed on the hilbert space .",
    "a popular approach is to treat the resulting fermion hamiltonian in mean field theory . at the mean - field level ,",
    "the excitations are neutral spin-@xmath1 fermions described by a hamiltonian of the general form eqn .",

    "( [ b - condition ] ) .",
    "if the mean field state is indeed stable to fluctuations , then we expect that the candidate wave function for the physical state described by it is given by the gutzwiller projection of the mean field wave function to the physical hilbert space .",

    "we find that the nnd state after projection has no topological order .",

    "this wave function ( denoted further as dd ) has the nearest - neighbor form ( [ nnd - xi ] ) of @xmath109 , together with @xmath110 involving both nearest - neighbor pairing and pairing along the plaquette diagonals : @xmath111 one easily verifies that the projected dd wave function has all the symmetries of the square lattice , even though the unprojected wave function does not .",
    "this wave function obeys the mean - field constraint ( [ mfcstr ] ) without a chemical potential term .",
    "=    the first test for the topological order is the overlap of the two wave functions on a torus projected from the mean - field states with different boundary conditions .",
    "note that when nodes in the mean - field excitation spectrum fall on points of the momentum lattice , the wave function becomes ill - defined . for our choice of lattice on the tori",
    ", this happens for the nnd state where the nodes are fixed at ( @xmath112,@xmath112 ) points .",
    "therefore , not all four topological sectors are realized for the nnd state ( for our choice of the lattice placement ) .",
    "however , the sectors @xmath113 and @xmath114 are well - defined for any @xmath115 torus , and we take the overlap between these two wave functions as the first check of the topological order . alternatively , this overlap may be viewed as the overlap of the wave function with its reflection with respect to the @xmath29@xmath33 diagonal .",
    "we have calculated this overlap with the use of the variational monte carlo procedure@xcite .",
    "the results for the nnd wave function and for its three modifications d1 , d2 , and dd , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - overlap]a . in all cases ,",
    "we take @xmath116 ; for d1 wave functions we take @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) ; for d2 wave functions we take @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) and @xmath117 ( @xmath123 ) ; for dd wave functions we take @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we see that the overlap for the nnd wave function saturates at large system size ( which implies the absence of topological order ) , while for the three other wave functions it decreases to zero with increasing system size .",
    "this is the first signature of the topological order in those wave functions . as a side remark",
    ", we mention that if we force @xmath126 in the d2 wave function , the projected wave function has no topological order ( the overlap saturates at large @xmath10 ) , but such a wave function violates the mean - field - density constraint ( [ mfcstr ] ) , and we do not discuss it here .    for the wave functions deep in",
    "the `` topologically ordered '' phase , we can also verify the orthogonality of all the four topological sectors @xmath127 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath128 . the four corresponding overlaps are plotted for each of the wave functions d1 , d2 , and dd in fig .",
    "[ fig - overlap]b  d .",
    "all the overlaps for these wave functions decrease to zero with increasing system size , which indicates orthogonality of the four sectors .    the second test for the topologically ordered state is the equality of local expectation values between different topological sectors ( condition ( ii ) of section  [ to ] ) .",
    "we verify this condition for the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlations .",
    "in the four topological sectors on the torus , there are four different nearest - neighbor correlators : @xmath129 in a topologically ordered state , the difference between these four quantities must rapidly decay with increasing system size .",
    "we compute these correlators numerically for the same three wave functions used before in the overlap computations .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - spin]a  c demonstrating that the four correlations indeed converge to a single value in large systems .",
    "this supports the contention that the distinction between the states is in global properties and not in local ones .    to quantify the rate of this convergence , we consider the mean square deviation of the four quantities @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 . in fig",
    ".  [ fig - spin]d , we plot this mean square deviation multiplied by the number of lattice sites @xmath134^{1/2}\\ ] ] as a function of system size .",
    "the finite - size effects are very strong because of the nodes in the spectrum . to clarify the size dependence of @xmath135 , we take one more wave function in each of the three classes d1 , d2 , dd , with slightly different variational parameters ( in addition to the wave functions considered previously ) . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - spin]d indicate that @xmath135 remains approximately independent of system size .",
    "this corresponds to the difference in local correlations @xmath136 decaying as @xmath137 with system size .",
    "this slow convergence of correlations among different topological sectors can be explained already at the mean - field level from the nodal singularities in the spectrum . at the nodal points ,",
    "the vector @xmath80 has a strong singularity : as the wave vector @xmath11 goes around the nodal point , the vector @xmath138 rotates by half turn in the plane .",
    "this singularity translates into the @xmath137 dependence of local correlations on the boundary conditions ( changing the boundary conditions amounts to shifting the lattice of vectors @xmath11 ) . from our numerical results we see that this rate of convergence is preserved by the projection",
    "this may serve as an indication that in the @xmath3 states the projection preserves the nodal spinons , as suggested by wen@xcite .",
    "this @xmath137 law applies to the general case of local correlations .",
    "the energy expectation value is a very special local correlation which has a weaker singularity at the nodal point . at the mean - field level",
    ", the energy splitting between different topological sectors can be found to be @xmath139 ( per site ) .",
    "this translates into the splitting in _ total _ energy decaying as @xmath140 .",
    "we expect that this asymptotic law also holds after the projection . to verify this numerically , one needs to compute the expectation values of the actual `` energy '' , which is a correlation function _",
    "optimized _ for a particular hamiltonian by adjusting the variational parameters . in this paper",
    "we do not identify spin hamiltonians for which our wave functions are optimal , and thus are not able to verify our expectation for the energy splitting .",
    "note that the @xmath140 convergence in energy also means convergence of the energy of an individual vison , i.e. , deconfinement of visons which is necessary for the topological order .",
    "we have also tested all the above classes of wave functions for the valence - bond crystal ( `` spin - peierls '' ) ordering@xcite .",
    "we have computed the correlations of the @xmath141-component of the singlet order parameter @xmath142 in systems as large as 18@xmath14318 .",
    "we find this correlation function rapidly decaying with increasing the distance @xmath144 .",
    "the decay is slowest for the d2 wave function for which it appears to be close to @xmath145 ( for the @xmath117 , @xmath123 wave function ) or faster ( for the @xmath146 , @xmath147 wave function ) . for d1 and dd wave functions the decay of such correlations is much stronger than in the d2 wave function , which indicates the absence of the valence - bond ordering .",
    "note that the d2 wave functions for the values of parameters considered in this paper exhibit a relatively large correlation length for the overlaps between topological sectors ( see fig .  [ fig - overlap]c for the data on the @xmath117 , @xmath123 wave function ) . therefore one may expect that correlation functions have different behavior at larger and smaller length scale , and that our computations in relatively small systems are therefore not completely reliable for determining the correct long - distance behavior of the correlations .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the valence - bond crystal ordering and of its interplay with the topological order is left for future study .",
    "in this paper , we have formulated conditions for the presence of topological order in rvb systems and have verified them for several specific examples of gutzwiller - projected wave functions .",
    "our results suggest that appropriate gutzwiller - projected wave functions may represent ground states of fractionalized phases of spin systems .",
    "this work is only the first step towards describing the topologically ordered rvb states . for a better understanding of the properties of the topological order , a more extensive quantitative study is needed .",
    "it should include an analysis of correlation lengths involved in the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) for the topological order ( in particular , on cylinders / tori with different aspect ratios ) .",
    "variational wave functions may provide a useful tool for studying quantum phase transitions between states with and without topological order .",
    "an extremely interesting question in this respect is the possibility of the coexistence of the topological order simultaneously with the antiferromagnetic neel order or with the valence - bond crystal order .",
    "such a coexistence of a topological and a conventional ordering may be tested by projecting appropriate superconducting states with the spin or translational symmetry broken before projection .",
    "of course , the study of the variational wave functions have physical implications only when the hamiltonians are identified for which those wave functions are good trial states . our test for the topological order may provide a guidance in the search for microscopic spin hamiltonians that exhibit fractionalized ground states .",
