    "the spin quantum hall ( sqh ) electronic state was discovered experimentally in the hgte / cdte quantum wells being called two - dimensional topological insulator ( 2d ti ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this electronic phase was found in materials such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , named 3d ti @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and gapless metallic surface ( edge for 2d ti ) states which are protected by time reversal symmetry ( trs ) @xcite .",
    "these surface states remain robust against small non - magnetic perturbations and they are characterized by topological invariants that are preserved as long as hamiltonian varies smoothly @xcite .",
    "in addition to their fundamental interest , their special properties make these states useful for several applications , from spintronics to quantum computation and optics @xcite .",
    "the long wavelength regime of em wave of 3d ti may be described by a topological field theory ( tft ) whose coefficients are quantized in terms of the fine structure constant , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this tft describes the topological magnetoelectric effect ( tme ) on the surface of the material when the trs is broken at the surface @xcite .",
    "thus , in the presence of em fields , an electric field induces a magnetization whereas a magnetic field induce an electric polarization .",
    "this topological effect is caused by a quantized hall current induced on the surface of the ti in response to an electric field , in ( 3 + 1 ) d , the tft is given by the action below @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electric and magnetic fields respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the permeability and permissivity of the ti and @xmath8 is the relevant topological parameter accounting for the tme effect and assumes @xmath9 for an ordinary insulator and @xmath10 for ti .",
    "this effective theory is valid only if a surface gap is open on the ti , this can be done by covering its surface with a thin magnetic film or applying an external magnetic field perpendicular @xcite . among other consequences , when light is send to a ti border its behaviour is deeply modified , for example , the light polarization plane is rotated by a universal angle leading to changes in the usual kerr and faraday effects @xcite .",
    "here , we study the propagation of em radiation confined to a slab - type waveguide which walls are the surface borders of a 3d ti . the interior of the guide is filled with an usual dielectric ( vacuum , for simplicity ) , with this , there is a variation in @xmath8 at the interface of the ti and thus a contribution from topological term in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) .",
    "we consider an aperture @xmath11 along @xmath12 and an infinite extension along @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions . in addiction , an external magnetic field",
    "is applied perpendicularly to the walls , as schematically drawn in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the functional variation of eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) yields maxwell s equations in the presence of tme , that read : @xmath15 @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    most studies on tme consider the charge ( @xmath19 ) and hall current ( @xmath20 ) densities perfectly concentrated on ti surface using a dirac @xmath21 distribution .",
    "we take into account the penetration length , @xmath22 , of surface metallic states on ti bulk .",
    "thus , in our approach : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( few nanometers ) for usual 3d ti , like @xmath1 @xcite . while @xmath26 is a unitary vector perpendicular to the walls of the waveguide .",
    "once this slab waveguide confines waves only in @xmath12 direction , we assume the modes are propagating freely along @xmath14 , so it is necessary to solve the maxwell equations for planar solutions of em fields such : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "taking then into eqs .",
    "( [ faraday ] ) and ( [ ampere - maxwell ] ) we obtain the transverse fields : @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . for the slab waveguide is only necessary to analyze the dynamics over @xmath14 , so , from eqs .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) and ( [ no mon ] ) we obtain : @xmath35    @xmath36    to decouple these equations we must depart to higher orders .",
    "doing that for @xmath37 , we get : @xmath38 b_z(x ) = 0,\\ ] ] + where @xmath39 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ edo bz ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath40 , we recover the standard equations as expected .",
    "the solution has the form : @xmath41 , valid for the @xmath42 , for @xmath43 the exponential signals are inverted so that solution remains finite .",
    "the constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 are fixed field amplitudes within the ti , while : @xmath46 from the wave equation for em fields , @xmath47 must satisfy @xmath48 , so that we finally obtain : @xmath49^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\,\\ , \\omega_{\\theta}=\\frac{2c}{\\pi \\epsilon}\\frac{\\alpha \\theta}{l}.\\ ] ] waves with @xmath50 do not propagate in ti surface , since @xmath51 becomes imaginary resulting in attenuation of the em radiation .",
    "these frequencies propagate along @xmath14 direction inside the waveguide only , therefore , @xmath52 is the topological cutoff frequency , such behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath53 .",
    "since the cutoff frequency depends on @xmath22 , the system proposed here can be useful to estimate the penetration length of the surface states in 3d ti bulk by measuring @xmath52 .",
    "the topological nature of @xmath52 stems from the tme on the surface of ti and this frequency corresponds to the minimum energy required for em radiation through the surface of ti .",
    "thus , em waves with @xmath50 are reflected keeping @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the slab surface and propagate along the waveguide .",
    "these results are in agreement with experimental data reported in ref.@xcite , which were made measurements of the reflectivity and optical conductivity of four 3d ti ( including @xmath1 ) from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and from sub - thz to visible frequencies .",
    "the data show a sharp drop in reflectivity ( @xmath56 ) at @xmath57 hz and @xmath58 for @xmath50 , as provided in our approach .    along @xmath12",
    ", the wave vector in ti can be expressed as a function of @xmath59 and sweeping the same frequency values made for eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) , we found that eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) takes the form : @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the wave vector perpendicular to ti surface have real ( @xmath61 ) and imaginary ( @xmath62 ) values .",
    "typical behaviours of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) and [ fig3 ] ( b ) respectively . below the cutoff frequency , the em wave is strongly attenuated when it penetrates the ti , once @xmath65 , so when @xmath50 there is an efficient confinement of the radiation along @xmath12 , according to nontrivial boundary conditions on em fields ( obtained from [ gauss ] and [ ampere - maxwell ] ) : @xmath66 where subscript @xmath67 denote the em fields in vacuum . in addiction , the stationary wave condition require that inside the wavequide , the wave vector along @xmath12 ( @xmath68 ) is discretized and depends on the geometrical parameters of the waveguide , i.e. , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . due to the large attenuation of em radiation around @xmath52 ,",
    "the skin depth ( @xmath71 ) of em wave in ti decreases rapidly in @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    ", @xmath63 vanishes , while @xmath64 reverse signal abruptly resulting in transmission of em radiation through the walls .",
    "this is in accordance whit optical conductivity ( @xmath74 ) measurements performed in ref.@xcite , where it was observed large values for @xmath74 in this frequency regime .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us give a brief analysis of transverse polarization modes .",
    "the transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode , @xmath75 , so , from eqs .",
    "( [ edo ez ] ) and ( [ edo bz ] ) we get : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "adopting procedure previously applied , we have @xmath78 hz as em waves with generic polarization ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) . in the transverse electric ( te ) polarization , @xmath81 , then : @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "note that for waveguide operating in the te mode there is no contribution of topological parameter @xmath8 , the transverse components ( eqs .",
    "( [ ex])-([by ] ) ) of @xmath4 and @xmath5 fields vanish on the walls and inside the ti leading to @xmath84 , that is , te waves do not produce tme in the slab waveguide . with theses conditions , the cutoff frequencies along the slab are similar to a waveguide with perfectly conducting walls , i.e. , @xmath85 @xmath86 . for em waves in the te mode ,",
    "frequencies less than @xmath87 do not propagate along the slab waveguide similarly to the conventional waveguides described in refs .",
    "in summary , we find that waveguide made from 3d ti walls can propagate em radiation efficiently and have cutoff frequencies with topological stability , which value depends on @xmath22 of the metallic surface states .",
    "the value provided here for @xmath52 agrees with experimental results of optical reflectivity and conductivity of 3d ti reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "this slab waveguide can be useful as a prototype to determine a microscopic quantity , @xmath22 , by measuring a macroscopic one , @xmath52 . in the tm mode",
    ", the cutoff frequency has the same characteristics and value of the generic polarization . on the other hand",
    ", te mode has no topological properties due to tme not manifest for this polarization state , so the cutoff frequency depends only on the geometric parameter ( @xmath11 ) similar to waveguide with usual conductive walls .",
    "other geometries as cylindrical waveguide , coaxial cable , resonant cavities , etc . can reveal new and useful electrodynamics properties of 3d ti .",
