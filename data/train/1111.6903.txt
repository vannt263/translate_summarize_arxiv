    "the fast marching method ( fmm ) was introduced by sethian @xcite as an efficient method to solve general front propagation problems where the propagation speed is monotonic . since its introduction",

    "recent attention has been focused on increasing the accuracy of the level set method by including level set gradient information @xcite .",
    "results for situations where the velocity field does not depend on the current interface show that the accuracy can be increased with minimal additional computational effort .",
    "issues do arise when the velocity field depends on the current interface description .",

    "these forces are related to the curvature and the variation of the curvature along the vesicle membrane .",
    "mathematically this means that the bending forces are fourth order derivatives of the level set function",
    ". the level set function should be as smooth as possible for all time and still be able to describe small scale features of the vesicle .",
    "this can be accomplished by periodically reinitializing the level set . as of",
    "yet a numerical method to accurately reinitialize the level set function and its gradients has not yet been developed .    in this work",
    "the reinitialization of a arbitrary level set function is considered .",
    "in addition to obtaining the signed distance function of an interface the method will allow for the accurate calculation of up to second order derivatives of the signed distance function .",
    "this will result in the calculation of smooth curvature fields , which aids in the stability of numerical methods depending on this quantity and its derivatives . in sec .",
