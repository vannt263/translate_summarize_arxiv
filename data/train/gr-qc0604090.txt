    "usually , for cosmological phenomena over galactic scale or in the smaller scale , it is reasonable to consider inhomogeneous solutions to einstein equations .",
    "szekeres [ 1 ] in 1975 , gave a class of inhomogeneous solutions representing irrotational dust .",
    "the space - time represented by these solutions has no killing vectors and it has invariant family of spherical hypersurfaces .",
    "hence this space - time is referred as quasi - spherical space - time .",
    "recently , chakraborty et al [ 2 ] have extended the szekeres solution to @xmath0 dimensional space - time and generalized it for matter containing heat flux [ 3 ] .",
    "+ in classical general relativity , one of the challenging issues is gravitational collapse .",
    "this problem became important after the formulation of famous singularity theorems [ 4 ] and cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc)[5 ] .",
    "also in the perspective of black hole physics and its astrophysical implications , the end state of collapse ( black hole or naked singularity ) is interesting . as there exists no formal method to address this problem so it is natural to study various examples of collapsing system ( namely , tolman - bondi - lematre ( tbl ) spherically symmetric model [ 6 - 15 ] or quasi - spherical szekeres model [ 16 - 18 ] ) with a view to gain some insight . in general , these studies conclude that the local or global visibility of the central curvature singularity depends on the initial data .",
    "+ the above studies are mostly confined to the dust model , there are very few works on anisotropic stress [ 19 ] ( confined to tbl model ) . for the last few years",
    ", there are attempts to study collapse dynamics in tbl model with anisotropic pressure to address the question `` can non - zero pressures within a collapsing matter cloud avoid a naked singularity forming as the end state of a continual gravitational collapse ? '' but so far , the actual role the pressures play in determining the end state of collapse is not yet clearly understood . due to complicated nature of the space - time geometry there are no works on gravitational collapse with anisotropic stresses in quasi - spherical model except recently by chakraborty et al [ 20 ] where they have shown the role of pressure in 4 dimension .",
    "+ in this work , we extend this study to @xmath0 dimensional szekeres model and examine the role of the dimension on collapse dynamics . the paper is organized as follows : higher dimensional szekeres model is described in section ii , while collapse dynamics including the study of geodesic is presented in section iii . in section iv , there are discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "finally at the end there are two appendix dealing with detailed calculations .",
    "the metric ansatz for ( n+2)dimensional szekeres space - time is of the form    @xmath1    where the metric coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of all space - time co - ordinates i.e. , @xmath4    now considering both radial and transverse stresses the energy momentum tensor has the structure    @xmath5    and the compact form of the einstein equations are    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "+ further , the expressions for the metric functions are    @xmath9    and the evolution equation for r gives    @xmath10    also the function @xmath11 satisfies    @xmath12=n(f(r)-1)\\ ] ]    which has a solution of the form @xmath13 with the restriction , @xmath14    for the arbitrary functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and c(r ) .",
    "+ as we are considering quasi - spherical gravitational collapse so it is natural to assume the initial configuration ( from which the collapse has started ) to be smooth everywhere .",
    "thus @xmath17 should be regular initially at the center and blows up at the singularity .",
    "so a natural choice for @xmath17 is    @xmath18    where the arbitrary function @xmath19 has the form @xmath20 near @xmath21 to make initial @xmath17 finite ( non - zero ) at the centre @xmath21 and @xmath22 is any constant .",
    "hence , the expressions for matter density and tangential stress become    @xmath23    and @xmath24+\\frac{g'(r)}{nr^{l-1}(r'+r\\nu')}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , an arbitrary integration function .",
    "+ now , due to this choice of @xmath17 ( see eq ( 8) ) the evolution eq ( 4 ) for @xmath27 can be integrated once and the radial velocity of collapsing shell at a distance @xmath28 from the centre is given by    @xmath29    this is termed as the equation of the collapsing process .",
    "to characterize the nature of the singularity ( black hole or naked singularity ) , the event horizon of observers at infinity plays an important role . but formation of event horizon depends greatly on the computation of null geodesics whose computation are almost impracticable for the present space - time geometry . so a closely related concept of a trapped surface ( a space - like 2-surface whose normals on both sides are future pointing converging null geodesic families ) will be considered .",
    "thus , if the 2-surface @xmath30 ( @xmath31constant , @xmath32constant ) is a trapped surface then it and its entire future development lie behind the event horizon provided the density falls off fast enough at infinity . hence mathematically , if @xmath33 denotes the tangent vector field to the null geodesics which is normal to @xmath30 then we have @xmath34    now the null geodesics will converge ( or diverge ) if the invariant @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) on the surface @xmath37 . + as a consequence , it is easy to show that the inward geodesics converges initially and throughout the collapsing process while the outward geodesics diverges initially but becomes convergent after a time @xmath38 ( time of formation of apparent horizon ) given by @xmath39    now using equations ( 8) and ( 11 ) we have    @xmath40    from appendix ii , it is to be noted that the central singularity ( at @xmath21 ) forms at time @xmath41 while a trapped surface is formed at a distance @xmath28 at time @xmath38 and their difference is given by the equation ( 37 ) .",
    "thus if the trapped surface is formed at a later instant than @xmath41 then it is possible for light signals from the singularity to reach a distant observer .",
    "hence , @xmath42 is the necessary condition for formation of naked singularity and on the otherhand , @xmath43 is the sufficient condition for black hole formation .",
    "also it should be mentioned that this criterion for naked singularity is purely local .",
    "+ further , as the time difference equation ( 37 ) is complicated , so to make a comparative study between @xmath44 and @xmath41 one can choose for simplicity @xmath45 and equation ( 37 ) takes the form    @xmath46    the following table shows the possibility of naked singularity or a black hole under different conditions : + @xmath47 @xmath48    from the table , to make the initial density gradient to be negative at the centre ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) one must have @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) . for the first case ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) @xmath53 is negative definite and there is always naked singularity as in the dust model .",
    "similarly , @xmath53 is positive definite in the second case which leads to black hole solution same as dust model . for the third and fourth cases ( when @xmath54 and @xmath55 have same sign ) either ns or bh is possible depending on the restrictions given in the table i ( see also figs 1 - 6 ) .",
    "however , in the last two cases , for @xmath56 only black hole solution is possible but for @xmath49 , both ns and bh are possible .",
    "+ further , if we assume that @xmath57 then the time difference in eq ( 37 ) becomes @xmath58~d_{0}^{\\frac{1}{n-1}}~r^{\\frac{3n+3 - 2l}{n-1}}+ ... ... ... \\right]\\ ] ]    we see that if @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) then the first term on the right side will be dominating compare to other terms and hence we always have @xmath61 .",
    "thus in this case black hole is the only final state collapse for six and higher dimensional space - times .",
    "this distinctive result is similar to dust collapse [ 13 , 16 ] and we conclude that ccc is valid in this case for six and higher dimension with anisotropic pressure .",
    "+      + fig.1  fig.2 +      + fig.3  fig.4 +      + fig.5  fig.6 + figs",
    ". 1 - 6 show variation of @xmath62 of eq.(13 ) for the variation of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "figs.1 , 3 and 5 correspond to @xmath65 for @xmath66 and 25 respectively while figs.2 , 4 and 6 correspond to @xmath67 for @xmath66 and 25 respectively .      in this section , the nature of the singularity ( ns or bh )",
    "is examined by studying the geodesics from the singularity . in particular , it will be investigated whether there exist one or more radial outgoing null geodesics which terminate in the past at the central singularity . for simplicity of calculation",
    "only marginally bound case ( @xmath68 ) with @xmath45 will be considered ( as in the previous section ) . now choosing the initial time @xmath69 , the explicit solution for @xmath70 can be written as    @xmath71\\ ] ]    thus the expression for the singularity time for the shell of radius @xmath27 is given by ( @xmath72 )    @xmath73\\ ] ]    and consequently the time for central singularity is    @xmath74    here the polynomial form of @xmath26 and @xmath19 are taken in the form    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are constants and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the first non - vanishing term beyond @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . now using these expression for @xmath26 and @xmath19 the time of collapse of a typical shell of radius @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) becomes ( see eq ( 16 ) )",
    "@xmath82    now the equation of the outgoing radial null geodesic ( orng ) which passes through the central singularity , can be chosen to be ( near @xmath21 )    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants .",
    "+ in the polynomial form for @xmath26 and @xmath19 in the equation ( 18 ) one can choose two possibilities : @xmath86    * case i * :   @xmath87 : + here near @xmath21 , the expression for @xmath81 can be written as ( see eq.(19 ) ) @xmath88    in order that null geodesic passes through the shell of radius @xmath27 before the trapped surface is formed there , comparing ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) one gets ( @xmath89 ) @xmath90    when @xmath91 then near @xmath21 the solution for @xmath27 simplifies to    @xmath92^{2/n+1}\\ ] ]    further for the given metric an orng should satisfy    @xmath93    now using ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) in ( 24 ) one gets ( up to leading order in @xmath28 )      this gives @xmath95^{2/(n+1)}\\ ] ]    as @xmath91 , so from the above relations ( 26 )    @xmath96    on the other hand for @xmath97 , as before @xmath98 and    @xmath99^{(1-n)/(n+1)}~\\times\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath100\\ ] ]    thus for @xmath91 , @xmath101 has only one value ( namely @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 can take any value ( @xmath104 ) while for @xmath97 the only possible values of @xmath103 are 2 and 3 only .",
    "therefore , geodesic equations are possible in any dimension for @xmath91 but it is only possible up to five dimension for @xmath97 . in other words , for @xmath97 ,",
    "naked singularity is possible only up to five dimension which supports the results in the previous section .",
    "lastly , it should be mentioned that the other choice namely @xmath105 is similar to the above and hence not presented here .",
    "a detailed analysis of the central curvature singularity as the final state of collapse in the ( @xmath106)-dimensional quasi - spherical szekeres model has been done for matter with anisotropic pressure ( i.e. , both radial and tangential pressures are non - zero and distinct ) .",
    "the local visibility of the central singularity has been discussed by comparing the time of formation of trapped surface and the time of formation of central shell focusing singularity while global visibility is examined by considering only the radial null geodesics ( for simplicity ) .",
    "most of the results are very similar to that for four dimension in ref . [ 13 ] .",
    "it is to be noted that though we have considered quasi - spherical szekeres model but still these are valid for tbl model .",
    "in fact , in szekeres solution if we assume the function @xmath11 to be independent of @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) then szekeres model can be converted to tbl model by the following coordinate transformation : + @xmath108    further , the radial pressure is assumed to be a function of ` @xmath28 ' and ` @xmath109 ' only with the form @xmath110 . throughout the paper @xmath22",
    "is chosen to be less than @xmath111 ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) [ it is to be noted that for @xmath112 due to appearance of a logarithmic term the calculations become very much complicated while for @xmath113 the results are not of much interest ] . it has been shown that for @xmath114 i.e. , for @xmath115 , naked singularity is only possible up to five dimension  a result identical in dust collapse . the above choice ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) gives @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "hence for @xmath119 , if the initial density gradient falls off at the centre ( @xmath21 ) then one can say that six dimension plays as critical dimension for naked singularity , a distinct result in higher dimension .",
    "further with the choice @xmath45 , a detailed comparative study has been done between the time of formation of trapped surface and that of central singularity and table i shows all possibilities for the parameters involved in the expression .",
    "also in the figures 1 - 6 we have shown graphically the time difference @xmath62 for 6 , 14 and 27 dimensions for @xmath65 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "+ as in dust collapse , in this case we have definitely a black hole ( or naked singularity ) if the initial density gradient at the centre is positive definite ( or negative definite ) .",
    "but in the indefiniteness in the sign of @xmath53 one may note that if the initial density and radial pressure has identical behaviour ( i.e. , increase or decrease simultaneously ) then even with initial negative density gradient ( at the centre ) it is possible to have black hole as the end state of collapse , while if the initial density and pressure have opposite nature ( i.e. , one increase when other decreases and vice versa ) then the behaviour is identical to dust collapse .",
    "therefore one may conclude that pressure tries to resist the formation of naked singularity .",
    "* initial hypersurface and the physical parameters : * + suppose the collapsing process starts on the initial hypersurface @xmath121 and we have @xmath122 there .",
    "then the expressions for energy density , radial pressure and the tangential pressure , at the beginning of the collapse are          it is to be noted that in the above series expansions the coefficients @xmath128 s and @xmath129 s ( @xmath130 ) are purely constants while @xmath131 s , @xmath132 s and @xmath133 s are functions of @xmath134 s ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "also these coefficients are not independent but are related among themselves through the relations in eq ( 29 ) as follows : + for @xmath51 : @xmath136      * solution of the evolution equation ( 11 ) with @xmath68 : * + for the initial choice @xmath122 at @xmath141 , the explicit solution is @xmath142-\\frac{\\sqrt{2n}~r^{\\frac{n+1}{2}}}{(n+1)\\sqrt{d(r)}}~_{2}f_{1}[\\frac{1}{2},b , b+1 , \\frac{g(r)r^{n+1-l}}{d(r)(n+1-l)}]\\ ] ]            a comparison of equations ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) shows that the shell focusing singularity that appears at @xmath150 is in the future of the apparent horizon . however , the time of occurrence of central shell focusing singularity ( which is of main interest here ) is given by      where the series form of @xmath19 and @xmath26 ( from eq .",
    "( 30 ) ) have been used in evaluating the limit .",
