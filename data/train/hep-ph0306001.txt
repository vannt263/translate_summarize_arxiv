    "neutrino oscillations are entering in a new era in which the observations from underground experiments obtained with neutrino beams provided to us by nature  either from the sun or from the interactions of cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere are being confirmed by experiments using `` man - made '' neutrinos from accelerators and nuclear reactors .",
    "super  kamiokande ( sk ) high statistics data  @xcite clearly established that the observed deficit in the @xmath3-like atmospheric events is due to the neutrinos arriving in the detector at large zenith angles , strongly suggestive of the @xmath0 oscillation hypothesis .",
    "this evidence was also confirmed by other atmospheric experiments such as macro  @xcite and soudan 2  @xcite . similarly , the sno results  @xcite in combination with the sk data on the zenith angle dependence and recoil energy spectrum of solar neutrinos  @xcite and the homestake  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex+gno  @xcite and kamiokande  @xcite experiments , put on a firm observational basis the long  standing problem of solar neutrinos  @xcite , establishing the need for @xmath4 conversions .",
    "the kek to kamioka long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ( k2k ) uses an accelerator - produced neutrino beam mostly consisting of @xmath0 with a mean energy of 1.3  gev and a neutrino flight distance of 250  km to probe the same oscillations that were explored with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "their results  @xcite show that both the number of observed neutrino events and the observed energy spectrum are consistent with neutrino oscillations with oscillation parameters consistent with the ones suggested by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the kamland experiment measures the flux of @xmath5 s from nuclear reactors with a energy of @xmath6 mev located at typical distance of @xmath6 180  km with the aim of exploring with a terrestrial beam the region of neutrino parameters that is relevant for the oscillation interpretation of the solar data .",
    "their first published  @xcite results show that both the total number of events and their energy spectrum can be better interpreted in terms of @xmath1 oscillations with parameters consistent with the the lma solar neutrino solution  @xcite .    altogether",

    "in addition to the dirac - type phase , @xmath10 , analogous to that of the quark sector , there are two physical phases associated to the majorana character of neutrinos , which however are not relevant for neutrino oscillations @xcite and will be set to zero in what follows .    in this paper",

    "so the analysis of solar and kamland data depends on three of the five oscillation parameters : @xmath24 and @xmath11 .",
    "conversely for small @xmath2 the three - neutrino oscillation analysis of the atmospheric and k2k neutrino data can be performed in the one mass scale dominance approximation neglecting the effect of @xmath2 . in this approximation the angle @xmath25 can be rotated away and it follows that the atmospheric and k2k data analysis restricts three of the oscillation parameters , namely , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath11 and the cp phase @xmath10 becomes unobservable .",

    "<S> we analyze the impact of the data on long baseline @xmath0 disappearance from the k2k experiment and reactor @xmath1 disappearance from the kamland experiment on the determination of the leptonic three - generation mixing parameters . performing an up - to - date global analysis of solar , atmospheric , reactor and long baseline neutrino data in the context of three - neutrino oscillations , we determine the presently allowed ranges of masses and mixing and we consistently derive the allowed magnitude of the elements of the leptonic mixing matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we also quantify the maximum allowed contribution of @xmath2 oscillations to cp - odd and cp - even observables at future long baseline experiments . </S>"
