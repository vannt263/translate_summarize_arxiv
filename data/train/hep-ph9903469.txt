    "in this first chapter we want to list some examples which demonstrate how the light velocity @xmath0(=1 ) becomes changed when a light ray traverses a region which is disturbed by the presence of certain field configurations , finite temperature environment , or casimir plates .",
    "let us focus on a pure constant applied magnetic field @xmath1 which acts as a birefringent medium for the incoming photon beam .",
    "one can distinguish between two polarization modes where either the @xmath2-field ( @xmath3-mode ) or the @xmath4-field ( @xmath5-mode ) of the light wave points along the direction perpendicular to the plane containing the @xmath1-field and the wave propagation direction , @xmath6-plane .",
    "then we obtain two corresponding refractive indices @xmath7 which are given by @xcite : @xmath8 the change in the light velocity is correspondingly @xmath9 @xmath10 so , when we consider light of wavelength @xmath11 travelling a path of length @xmath12 normal to the @xmath1-field , the angular rotation of the plane of polarization is given by @xcite @xmath13 using the two phase velocities ( [ 1.2 ] ) ( to one - loop order only ) the average over polarization and direction is given by @xmath14      here the velocity of soft photons moving in a photon gas at low temperature @xmath15 is given by @xcite @xmath16      for a photon propagating perpendicular to casimir plates with distance @xmath17 one obtains @xcite @xmath18    further velocity shifts can be found for photons moving in a gravitational background @xcite .",
    "observe that all the examples are low - energy phenomena .",
    "covering all these aforementioned cases latorre , pascual and tarrach @xcite presented an intriguing general , so - called `` unified '' formula .",
    "they claimed that the polarization and direction - averaged velocity shift is related to the ( renormalized ) background energy density @xmath19 with a `` universal '' numerical coefficient @xmath20    that all these cases can only be of limited validity becomes clear when looking at the strong @xmath1-field regime @xmath21 where one finds @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "\\label{1.10}\\ ] ] also of limited value is shore s conjecture @xcite that the `` universal '' coefficient in ( [ 1.9 ] ) can be related to the trace anomaly of the energy momentum tensor : @xmath23 . \\label{1.11}\\ ] ] it is our goal to rederive some of the former results and generalize the `` unified formula '' of latorre , pascual and tarrach .",
    "we confine ourselves to the case of non - trivial vacua modified by qed phenomena .",
    "here are the essential assumptions that are needed for a description of light propagation in various perturbed vacua employing the effective action approach :    \\(1 ) the propagating photons with field strength @xmath24 are considered to be soft : @xmath25 .",
    "\\(2 ) the vacuum modification is homogeneous in space and time .",
    "\\(3 ) vacuum modifications caused by the propagating light itself are negligible .",
    "let us now turn to pure electromagnetic vacuum modifications where the dynamical building blocks of the effective action which respect lorentz and gauge invariance are given by @xmath26 the lowest - order linearly independent scalars ( pseudo - scalars ) are @xmath27 hence the maxwell lagrangian can be written as @xmath28 .",
    "the fundamental algebraic relations @xcite , @xmath29 help to verify ( i ) the vanishing of odd - order invariants and ( ii ) that invariants of arbitrary order can be reduced to expressions only involving @xmath30 ; @xmath31 . besides , note that parity invariance demands for @xmath32 to be even .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian becomes then simply a function of @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 from here we obtain the equations of motion by variation , @xmath36 or , after taking advantage of the bianchi identity while moving @xmath37 to the right , @xmath38 where @xmath39 what follows is a 5-step calculation consisting of    \\(1 ) @xmath40 : @xmath41    \\(2 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 in the lorentz gauge    \\(3 ) average over polarization states : @xmath44 .",
    "these intermediate steps yield instead of ( [ 2.7 ] ) @xmath45 equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) already represents a light cone condition and indicates that the familiar @xmath46 relation will in general not hold for arbitrary lagrangians .",
    "\\(4 ) using the fundamental relations ( [ 2.4 ] ) together with the maxwell energy - momentum tensor , @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 .\\label{2.11}\\ ] ]    \\(5 ) finally we need the vev of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the effective action .",
    "after these 5 steps we end up with the desired lcc : @xmath51 with @xmath52}}. \\label{2.14}\\ ] ] now we want to extend the lcc to arbitrary vacuum disturbances , not only of electromagnetic field type .",
    "let us therefore parametrize the additional vacuum modifications by the label @xmath53 and write instead of ( [ 2.13 ] ) @xmath54 in the sequel , we assume the vacuum to behave as a passive medium which leads to @xmath55 this equation states that the vacuum exhibits no back - reaction caused by the em fields while switching on @xmath53 .",
    "one can think of this approximation as a kind of adiabatic or born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "@xmath56 depends functionally on @xmath57 , which is , as usual , defined via the functional integral over the fluctuating fields : @xmath58\\ , \\exp\\bigl\\ { { \\text{i}}s_{\\text{qed } } \\bigl [ \\psi,\\bar{\\psi},a;a^{\\text{ext } } \\bigr ] \\bigr\\ } = z\\bigl[a^{\\text{ext}}\\bigr].\\ ] ] from here we obtain for the definition of @xmath59 @xmath60\\ , \\exp\\bigl\\ { { \\text{i}}s_{\\text{qed } } \\bigl [ \\psi,\\bar{\\psi},a;a^{\\text{ext } } \\bigr]\\bigr|_z \\bigr\\ } = z\\bigl[a^{\\text{ext}}\\bigr]\\bigr|_z.\\ ] ] e.g. , if the modification @xmath53 imposes boundary conditions on the fields , as is the case for the casimir effect or the thermalization of photons or fermions in loop graphs , the functional integral has to be taken over the fields which satisfy these boundary conditions . therefore , taking",
    "the vev of @xmath56 defines the new effective lagrangian characterizing the complete modified vacuum : @xmath61 here , then , is the lcc for arbitrary homogeneous modified vacua : @xmath62 if we choose a special lorentz frame , @xmath63 we obtain for eq .",
    "( [ 2.18 ] ) : @xmath64 this lcc is a generalization of the `` unified formula '' of latorre , pascual and tarrach @xcite .",
    "if we , furthermore , average over propagation directions , i.e. , integrate over @xmath65 and assume @xmath66 , we obtain : @xmath67 at this stage let us return to shore s conjecture @xcite which suggests a deeper connection between the velocity shift and the trace anomaly . from ( [ 2.12 ] ) , we can read off the relation @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{2.23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so there is a relation between the trace anomaly and the velocity shift for different polarization states .",
    "notice , however , that this result is tied to using the heisenberg - euler lagrangian in the weak field limit . in general",
    "it is the @xmath56-factor that is linked to @xmath69 , as can be seen by writing the numerator of ( [ 2.14 ] ) in the form @xmath70 and only for the special structure of the h.e .- lagrangian where @xmath71 is shore s conjecture true . referring to the right - hand side of ( [ 2.20 ] ) , the value and sign of the velocity shift result from the competition between the vev of the energy - momentum tensor and the @xmath56-factor . for small corrections to the maxwell lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath72 we have @xmath73 , which reduces eq .",
    "( [ 2.14 ] ) to @xmath74 because of the similarity to the ( 2d ) poisson equation , from now on we will call @xmath56 the effective action charge in field space .",
    "the classical vacuum @xmath75 is uncharged and hence @xmath76 .",
    "as we will soon demonstrate , the pure qed vacuum has a small positive charge at the origin in field space @xmath77 .",
    "let us start with the two - loop heisenberg - euler lagrangian @xcite , @xmath78 with @xmath79 then we obtain for the effective action charge @xmath80 so that eq .",
    "( [ 2.21 ] ) immediately yields : @xmath81.\\label{3.4}\\ ] ]      here we begin with schwinger s proper - time expression @xcite  still valid for arbitrary constant field strength ",
    "@xmath82 . \\label{3.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the complete formula for the effective action charge for a purely magnetic background field can be performed analytically and yields @xmath83 : @xmath84     .\\label{3.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for strong fields , the last term in ( [ 3.6 ] ) , @xmath85 , dominates the expression in the square brackets .",
    "hence , the effective action charge decreases with @xmath86 finally , the light cone condition ( [ 2.20 ] ) yields , for strong magnetic background fields for which @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\longrightarrow 1-\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi }   & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\sin^2 \\theta    \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{b}{{b_{\\text{cr } } } } \\qquad\\text{for } \\quad    b\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}{b_{\\text{cr } } } , \\label{3.9 } \\\\",
    "\\text{e.g.,}\\quad\\delta v\\simeq 9.58 .. \\cdot 10^{-5 } & & \\qquad\\qquad    \\quad\\,\\,\\text{at } \\quad b={b_{\\text{cr}}}=\\frac{m^2}{e } , \\label{3.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at least on a formal stage , even the @xmath89 limit can be taken .",
    "for this , the complete structure of the effective action charge @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.14 ] ) has to be taken into account as well as the phase velocity dependence of the product @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.21 ] ) .",
    "the result for the velocity square reads : @xmath91 in this limit , we find that a photon propagation perpendicular to the magnetic field is strongly suppressed , while a propagation along the magnetic field lines obtains no modifications",
    ". however , we must remember that we calculated the polarization - summed average velocity , and so the true modes of propagation might be different .",
    "nevertheless , this result shows similarities to the propagation of photons along the magnetic field lines in a plasma ( alfvn - mode propagation ) .      in accordance with experimental facilities , the plate separation @xmath17 is treated as a macroscopic parameter @xmath92 . in order not to violate the soft photon approximation @xmath93",
    ", the photon wavelength has to obey @xmath94 .",
    "only then can we treat the casimir region as a ( macroscopic ) medium .    accepting these assumptions ,",
    "@xmath56 is simply given by @xmath95 together with @xmath96 , as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath97 and eq .",
    "( [ 2.20 ] ) , we obtain for the propagation of light perpendicular to the plates the superluminal phase and group velocity : @xmath98 equation ( [ 3.13 ] ) represents the two - loop corrected version of scharnhorst s formula ..    taking the leading radiative correction to the casimir energy into account , bordag , robaschik and wieczorek @xcite obtained the result : @xmath99 at the two - loop level of eq .",
    "( [ 3.13 ] ) , this correction can nevertheless be neglected , since @xmath100 .",
    "we begin with the one - loop correction to the effective qed lagrangian at finite temperature which can be decomposed according to @xmath101 from which follows : @xmath102 for purely magnetic fields , @xmath103 was calculated by dittrich @xcite : @xmath104 . \\label{3.17}\\ ] ] notice that in @xmath105 , we have to differentiate with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "so we must first re - introduce @xmath33 and @xmath34 , differentiate and then put @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107\\cot\\bigl[es\\bigl (    \\sqrt{\\!x^2+\\!y^2}\\!-x\\bigr)\\!^{{{\\scriptstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}}\\bigr].\\ ] ] the temperature - dependent part of the effective action charge is then given by @xmath108 here are some limiting cases .",
    "for low temperature we obtain : @xmath109 hence , the effective action charge is perfectly described by @xmath110 in the high - temperature limit @xmath111 , the result turns out to be @xmath112 , \\qquad\\quad k_1=0.123749\\dots\\ , .\\label{3.21}\\ ] ] therefore the complete effective action charge decreases rapidly , @xmath113 : @xmath114 for the lcc we need the vev of the energy - momentum tensor which is given by @xcite @xmath115 for qed , we obtain : @xmath116 so we arrive at the velocity of soft photons moving in a photon ( or photon + @xmath117- ) gas : @xmath118      first we consider the low - temperature region . here the lcc yields : @xmath119 neglecting @xmath120 in the low - temperature limit we end up with scharnhorst s result .",
    "but we do not find an additional velocity shift @xmath121 , as could have been expected from eq .",
    "( [ 3.24 ] ) .",
    "this clearly arises from the fact that none of the ( quantized ) perpendicular modes can be excited at low temperature .",
    "the @xmath120-term in eq .",
    "( [ 3.26 ] ) will become important for @xmath122 , i.e. , @xmath123 k. this shows that the scharnhorst effect is stable for @xmath124 k.    for increasing temperature , we find an intermediate temperature region characterized by the condition @xmath125 which corresponds to @xmath126ev @xmath127mev .",
    "this implies that @xmath128 is a justified approximation .",
    "the velocity shift in this case is given by @xmath129 in this limit , only the modifications caused by the blackbody radiation become important .",
    "a term proportional to @xmath130 does not occur , since higher ( perpendicular ) modes have been excited .",
