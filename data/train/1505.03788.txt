    "while the discovery at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a higgs boson with a mass of 125 gev is an extraordinary outcome of the cern machine operations , one of the primary questions that we need to ask now is whether this particle corresponds to the higgs boson embedded in the standard model ( sm ) or else belongs to some beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenario .",
    "in fact , the sm suffers from a key theoretical drawback , the so - called  hierarchy \" problem , pointing out that it could be a low energy effective theory valid only up to some cut - off energy .",
    "the latter can well be at the tev scale , hence in an energy range accessible at the lhc , so that new physics ( np ) could be discovered at the cern machine in the coming years .",
    "for this reason many bsm scenarios , which could be revealed at the tev scale , were proposed in the last decades , the most popular being supersymmetry , which removes the hiearchy problem through the presence of new states with different spin statistics from the sm ones cancelling ( up to residual logarithmic effects ) the divergent growth of the sm higgs mass upon quantum effects .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that the higgs particle may be a composite state arising from some strongly interacting dynamics at a high scale .",
    "this will also solve the hierarchy problem owing to compositeness form factors taming such a divergent behaviour .",
    "furthermore , the now measured light higgs mass could be consistent with the fact that such a composite state arises as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) from a particular coset of a global symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "models with a pngb higgs generally predict modifications of its couplings to both bosons and fermions of the sm , hence the measurement of these quantities represents a powerful way to test the possible non - fundamental nature of the newly discovered state .",
    "moreover , the presence of additional particles in the spectrum of such composite higgs models ( chms ) leads to both mixing effects with sm states as well as new feynman diagram topologies both of which would represent a further source of deviations from the sm expectations .    in the near future , with the energy increase to 13  tev for run ii , the lhc will be able to test bsm scenarios more extensively , probing the existence of new particles predicted by bsm extensions to an unprecedented level",
    ". nevertheless the expected bounds , though severe , might not be conclusive enough to completely exclude such scenarios .",
    "as an example , new gauge bosons predicted by chms with mass larger than @xmath2 2  tev could escape the detection of the lhc for several reasons : they could sizable interfere with the sm gauge bosons and among themselves , so determining a reduction of the number of signal events , or they could have sufficiently large widths , due to the opening of extra - fermion decay channels , making their detection critical @xcite .",
    "furthermore , concerning the higgs properties , the lhc[high - luminosity lhc ( hl - lhc ) ] will not be able to measure the higgs couplings to better than 5[2]% @xcite thus leaving room to scenarios , like chms , which predict deviations within the foreseen experimental accuracy for natural choices of the compositeness scale @xmath3 in the tev range .    on account of this",
    ", we will assume here the case in which lhc will not discover a @xmath4 ( or not be able to clearly assess its properties ) and also will not discover any extra fermion ( or it will discover it with a mass around 700 gev , which is roughly the present bound , but without any other hint about the theory to which it belongs ) . in this situation , an @xmath0 collider could have a great power in enlightening indirect effects of bsm physics .",
    "the advantages of electron - positron colliders with respect to the hadron ones ( e.g. , the cleanliness of the environment , the precision of the measurements , the large number of higgs bosons produced , the rich top - quark physics program ) make an analysis of its prospects in disentangling the fundamental from the composite nature of the higgs boson and in testing the partial compositeness of the fermion sector of primary importance .    for these reasons , we will here assess the generic potential of @xmath0 colliders in testing a particular realisation of chms , the so - called 4-dimensional composite higgs model ( 4dchm ) of ref .",
    "the main higgs production channels of the 4dchm were already considered in @xcite for three possible energy stages and different luminosity options of the proposed @xmath0 machines and results were confronted with the expected experimental accuracies in various higgs decay channels . here , we want to stress also the potential of such colliders in discovering imprints of partial compositeness in the top - quark sector through an accurate determination of the top properties at the @xmath1 production threshold and in searching for new resonances with top quarks well above their production threshold .",
    "we will consider two processes where a linear collider is expected to crucially complement the lhc physics potential : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and use the 4dchm as a calculable prototype describing a pngb higgs boson emerging from the @xmath7 breaking .",
    "a pngb higgs state has non - standard couplings to both bosons and fermions of the sm , hence a precice measurement of these quantities at present hadronic and future leptonic machines will test the possible non - fundamental nature of the last discovered particle .",
    "chms generally describe also additional spin-1 and spin-1/2 particles though , both of which would represent a non - negligible source of further deviations from the sm expectations .",

    "the present bounds on @xmath10 masses depend on their decay branching fractions and are around 700 gev .",
    "the 13  tev run of the lhc is expected , if no such @xmath10 state is discovered , to impose stronger bounds , but , in cases , as the one at hand , of multiple quasi - degenerate new fermion states interfering among themselves and with the same - charge sm quarks , a detailed analysis is necessary to properly specialize the bounds extracted from the experiments .",
    "for this reason we have restricted our parameter scans by only allowing for @xmath10 masses larger than 700 gev . concerning the @xmath18 mass instead",

    "independent effective approaches , which are generally used for the phenomenological studies of chms , the new particle exchange effects are not captured ( this corresponds to a `` decoupling limit '' where the additional particles are made sufficiently heavy ) .",
    "however they can be crucial at both high and moderate center - of - mass energies , @xmath23 .",
    "in @xcite we have shown how quantitative studies of higgs boson phenomenology in chms at future @xmath0 colliders can not ignore effects from realistic mass spectra .",
    "the same conclusion holds true for the extraction of the top yukawa coupling from @xmath24 . at the running energy stages of 500 and 1000 gev",

    "the circles in the figure represent the `` decoupling limit '' obtained by simply rescaling the couplings of the pngb higgs to fermions and neglecting the contribution of the extra matter , as done in the aforementioned model independent approaches . in the right panel",

    "the biggest deviations of the signal stregths relative to the `` decoupling limit '' results ( mainly at @xmath30  tev ) are due to the exchange of @xmath10 states ( from the comparison of the center and right panels ) showing that the potential of a future @xmath0 collider in accessing realistic composite higgs scenarios is very significant also via top - quark processes , with a warning though : the extraction of the top - yukawa coupling in bsm schemes , like this one , can not simply rely on the rescaling of the coupling predicted by the model .",
