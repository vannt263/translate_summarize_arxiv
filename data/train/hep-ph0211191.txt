    "nucleon scattering provides one of the cleanest methods to test qcd by measuring the scaling violations of structure functions from which the qcd  scale @xmath2 , one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model , is derived with high precision .",
    "the qcd  analysis also delivers the various twist2 parton distributions as functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the detailed knowledge of which is necessary for the forthcoming experimental search for the higgs  boson and new , yet undiscovered states beyond the standard model , at tevatron and lhc .",
    "one of the major goals of the experiments h1 and zeus at the @xmath1collider hera at desy is to perform a qcd test at large space  like virtualities @xmath4 at high precision .",
    "this presumes to know the qed radiative corrections to the double  differential scattering cross sections of deeply inelastic @xmath1 corrections as precisely as possible .",
    "previous calculations of the radiative corrections for the unpolarized cross sections at leading order [ 15 ] , the leading  log level [ 712 ] to leading and higher orders , and qed  resummations of small@xmath3 terms  [ 11,13 ] orders revealed that these corrections are very large , particularly in the interesting regions of small @xmath3 and for almost all @xmath3 at large inelasticities @xmath5 . the corrections are , moreover , complicated by a new type of sizeable contributions as the compton ",
    "peak  @xcite .",
    "this makes it necessary to extend the calculations to higher orders .",
    "the higher order leading  logarithmic contributions @xmath6 $ ] to qed corrections are obtained as the leading order solution of the associated renormalization group equations  @xcite for mass factorization .",
    "these corrections are universal , process  independent w.r.t . their structure , and",
    "are given in terms of mellin  convolutions of leading order qed splitting functions .",
    "the next  to  leading order ( nlo ) corrections can be obtained along the same line . however , besides the splitting functions to nlo also the respective process ",
    "dependent wilson coefficients and operator matrix elements in the on - mass - shell ( oms ) scheme contribute . in the past",
    "this method was applied to a single differential distribution for the @xmath7 initial  state qed radiative corrections to @xmath8 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this letter we calculate the leptonic qed corrections to deeply inelastic @xmath1 scattering , where we define the double  differential scattering cross section choosing mixed variables  [ 8,2,5 ] , in @xmath9 .",
    "if compared to the case dealt with in @xcite to @xmath9 the present calculation is more complicated due to the emergence of final state radiation , the double  differential cross section and the relevant rescaling , which implies non  mellin type convolutions in general . after summarizing main kinematic aspects we present the different contributions to the leptonic nlo qed corrections .",
    "further details of the calculation and numerical results will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 collider experiments allow to measure the kinematic variables defining the inclusive deep ",
    "inelastic scattering cross sections in various ways since four kinematic variables are available in principle with the energies and angles of both the outgoing lepton and the struck ",
    "quark , see e.g.  @xcite . at the born level",
    "all methods are equivalent , however , resolution effects as a consequence of the detector s structure , differ in certain kinematic regions .",
    "the bremsstrahlung  effects of qed radiative corrections change this picture drastically and the qed correction factors depend on the way the kinematic variables , as e.g. bjorken@xmath10 and the virtuality @xmath4 are measured . for a comparison of a wide range of different choices of measurement . ] in the present paper we calculate the nlo radiative corrections in the case of neutral current deep ",
    "inelastic scattering for mixed variables , i.e. that @xmath11 is measured at the leptonic and @xmath12 is measured at the hadronic vertex , and @xmath13 .",
    "the born cross section for @xmath14exchange is given by contribution for a cross section being proportional to @xmath15 . ]  : @xmath16,\\ ] ] with @xmath17,\\\\ f_2(x , q^2 ) & = & 2x f_1(x , q^2 ) + f_l(x , q^2)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 denote the nucleon structure functions for photon exchange , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the quark and antiquark distribution functions . the sub ",
    "system variables obey the following rescaling relations for initial and final  state radiation  : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 are the initial and final  state jacobians @xmath23 , and @xmath24 marks the lower bound of the sub  system rescaling variable @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the rescaling in eqs .",
    "( [ eqresc1],[eqresc2 ] ) was chosen such that both the initial and final  state operator matrix elements can be expressed by a variable @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "@xmath27 is introduced as a scale to cut away contributions of the compton peak .",
    "although these terms do formally belong to the qed radiative corrections , they stem from a kinematic domain of low virtualities and are therefore not being associated to deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the scale @xmath28 or larger can be chosen by experiment accepting only those events in the sample to be analyzed for which the _ hadronic _ @xmath4 is larger than @xmath27 . by this measure",
    "the compton peak is cut away widely and the qed ",
    "correction factor is dominated by a deep  inelastic sub ",
    "process by far .",
    "finally we note that in the case of mixed variables the leptonic qed radiative corrections can be easily grouped into those for the initial and final state .",
    "the separation scale between the two kinematic regions is @xmath29 , i.e. we speak of initial state radiation for @xmath30 and of final state radiation for @xmath31 .",
    "in this paper we limit the consideration to the calculation of the nlo corrections to leptonic variables for one  photon exchange in electron  nucleon scattering .",
    "this approach is widely model independent and allows to refer to general non  perturbative parameterizations of the structure functions which describe the hadronic tensor . in this way",
    "a direct unfolding of the experimentally measured structure functions is possible down to the range in @xmath4 and @xmath3 in which partonic approaches fail to provide a description of structure functions .",
    "the radiative corrections are thus valid as well for inclusive _ diffractive _ @xmath1scattering , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the radiative corrections to be calculated concern a neutral  current process in which the lepton stays the same  : both an incoming electron ( positron ) results into an outgoing electron ( positron ) . as was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite changes of the fermion species are possible starting with 2loop order . to keep the qed @xmath32factor close to the basic process we limit the consideration of the present paper to those contributions in which the electron ",
    "type is preserved .",
    "the scattering cross section to @xmath7 reads  : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] corrections were calculated in ref .",
    "the term @xmath38 was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite completing the @xmath39 corrections .",
    "we re - calculated these corrections and agree with the previous results .",
    "correction @xmath40 can be obtained representing the scattering cross section using mass  factorization , see @xcite .",
    "although the differential scattering cross section does not contain any mass singularity , one may decompose it in terms of wilson coefficients and operator - matrix elements being convoluted with the born cross section . in this decomposition",
    "both the operator matrix elements and the wilson coefficients depend on the factorization scale @xmath41 .",
    "one writes the scattering cross section as @xmath42 with @xmath43 the initial and final state operator matrix elements and @xmath44 the respective wilson coefficients .",
    "@xmath45 denotes a convolution , which depends on specific rescalings of the chosen kinematic variables for the differential cross sections and is specified below .",
    "both the operator matrix elements and the wilson coefficients obey the representations @xmath46 the sequences @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the above do always denote @xmath49 for the incoming and @xmath50 the outgoing particle .",
    "as the differential cross section is @xmath51independent , the cross section is expressed by convolutions of the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that the @xmath41dependence cancels and a structure like eq .  ( [ eq2l ] ) is obtained .",
    "the treatment in the oms scheme assumes that the light fermion mass , @xmath54 , is kept everywhere it is giving a finite contribution to the scattering cross section if compared to the large scale @xmath4 , i.e. the only terms being neglected are power corrections which are of @xmath55,~k \\geq 1 $ ] and therefore small .",
    "the last step is necessary to maintain the anticipated convolution structure which , in parts , is of the mellin  type , as also in a massless approach .    in the subsequent relations we make frequent use of the rescaling ( [ eqresc1],[eqresc2 ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the following short  hand notation for the rescaling of a function @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 label the respective type of rescaling .",
    "corrections may be grouped into the following contributions  :    1 .",
    "lo initial and final state radiation off @xmath59 2 .   coupling constant renormalization of @xmath59 3 .",
    "lo initial state splitting of @xmath60 at @xmath61 4 .",
    "lo final state splitting of @xmath62 at @xmath63 5 .",
    "nlo initial and final state radiation off @xmath64    the function @xmath65 then is given by @xmath66 where @xmath12 , @xmath67 .",
    "the function @xmath68 is obtained by @xmath69 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\int_0 ^ 1 dz p_{ee}^0(z ) \\left[\\theta\\left(z - z_0^f\\right )   j^f(z ) \\widetilde{c}^{(1,1)}_f(y , q^2 ) -{c}^{(1,1)}(y , q^2 ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 denotes the non  logarithmic part of the @xmath39 correction  @xcite and @xmath71 is the lo fermion ",
    "fermion splitting function @xmath72 to illustrate the convolution structure in ( [ eqconv ] ) we note that @xmath73 \\otimes c^{(0,0)}(y , q^2)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] also the lo off - diagonal splitting functions @xmath74 occur in other contributions to @xmath75 .",
    "here both for lo and nlo splitting functions for equal particle transitions we write the contributions for @xmath76 and account for the + -functions in explicit form below .",
    "we calculated the @xmath9 leptonic qed corrections to deep inelastic @xmath1 scattering for the case of mixed variables .",
    "the corrections are given in terms of double  differential distributions to be compared to the double differential born cross section .",
    "the calculation was performed using the renormalization ",
    "group decomposition of the 2loop corrections to the differential cross section w.r.t .",
    "mass factorization in the oms scheme for the light fermion mass .",
    "mass factorization introduces an artificial factorization scale @xmath41 on which the physical cross section does not depend . by the elimination of this scale the structure of the differential cross section is re  organized in terms of pieces which can be calculated first individually and which are then composed to the desired correction term to be obtained .",
    "the nlo correction consists out of five terms , the lo isr and fsr radiation correction of the non  logarithmic @xmath39 contribution , a respective term due to charge renormalization , two new terms containing @xmath101 initial and final state transitions , and the isr and fsr oms  nlo radiation correction to the born term .",
