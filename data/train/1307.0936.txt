    "at present , qcd can not describe quantitatively the low - energy nucleon - antinucleon interaction , and various phenomenological approaches have been suggested in order to explain numerous experimental data , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and recent reviews @xcite .",
    "however , parameters of the models still can not be extracted with a good accuracy from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "very recently , renewed interest in low - energy nucleon - antinucleon physics has been stimulated by the experimental observation of a strong enhancement of decay probability at low invariant mass of @xmath1 in the processes @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "one of the most natural explanation of this enhancement is final state interaction of the proton and antiproton @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in the investigation of the proton ( antiproton ) electric , @xmath8 , and magnetic , @xmath9 , form factors in the process @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "namely , it was found that the ratio @xmath11 strongly depends on @xmath12 ( in the center - of - mass frame ) in the narrow region of the energy @xmath13 near the threshold of @xmath1 production .",
    "such strong dependence at small @xmath13 is related to the large - scale interaction of proton and antiproton .",
    "therefore , it is possible to apply the approaches of @xcite for an explanation of experimental data in the process @xmath0 . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the paris nucleon - antinucleon optical potential @xmath14 which has the form @xcite : @xmath15 where the real part @xmath16 is the @xmath17-parity transform of the well established paris @xmath18 potential for the long- and medium - range distances ( @xmath19 ) , and some phenomenological part for the short distances .",
    "the absorptive part @xmath20 of the optical potential takes into account the inelastic channels of @xmath21 interaction , i.e. annihilation into mesons .",
    "it is essential at short distances and depends on the kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "we perform calculations in the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "the coulomb interaction between proton and antiproton is important only for the kinetic energy @xmath22  mev , where @xmath23 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath24 is the proton mass .",
    "here we consider the process for kinetic energies @xmath25  mev , therefore we neglect the coulomb interaction .    taking into account that the difference of the cross sections @xmath0 and @xmath26 is small @xcite",
    ", we calculate the cross sections at a given isospin final states and compare them with the experimental data for @xmath27 . as a result we found that the amplitude with the isospin @xmath28 strongly dominates .",
    "besides , our prediction for the ratio @xmath11 depends on the parameters of the paris potential but independent of the form factor at threshold .",
    "the ratio is also in a qualitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "in the nonrelativistic approximation , the amplitude of @xmath29 pair production in a certain isospin channel @xmath30 near threshold can be presented as follows ( in units @xmath31 ) : @xmath32\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathcal g_s^i=\\mathcal f_1^i(q^2)+\\mathcal f_2^i(q^2)+\\frac{\\beta^2}{6}[\\mathcal f_2^i(q^2)-\\mathcal f_1^i(q^2)]\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mathcal g_d^i=\\mathcal f_1^i(q^2)-\\mathcal f_2^i(q^2)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is a virtual photon polarization vector , corresponding to the projection of spin @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the spin-1 function of @xmath29 pair , @xmath37 is the projection of spin on the vector @xmath38 .",
    "two tensor structures in eq.([2 ] ) correspond to the s - wave and d - wave production amplitudes .",
    "the total angular momentum of the @xmath29 pair is fixed by a production mechanism .",
    "the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the dirac form factors of the @xmath29 pair which include the effects of final state interaction and have a pronounced @xmath41 behavior near the threshold .",
    "summation over the polarization of nucleon pair and averaging over the polarization of virtual photon is performed using the equations , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the electron momentum .",
    "our aim is to single out the effects of final state interaction . in order to do that , we write the amplitude ( [ 2 ] ) in the form @xmath44\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath45 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath46 , the wave function of the @xmath29 pair in coordinate space .",
    "this wave function is the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the optical potential .",
    "note that @xmath49 is the left eigenfunction of the bi - orthogonal set of eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian operator @xmath50 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the wave function at large distances reads @xmath51 in eq.([3 ] ) the form factors @xmath52 and @xmath53 are @xmath54 where the `` bare '' dirac form factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not account for the effect of final state interaction .",
