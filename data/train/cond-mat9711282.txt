    "simulation results of the ca model for traffic flow introduced by nagel and schreckenberg @xcite ( nasch model , for a detailed explanation see @xcite ) show a reasonable agreement with experimental data , although the model definition includes only a few simple update rules . due to its simplicity",
    "it can be used very efficiently for computer simulations , but also an analytical treatment is possible @xcite .    one important experimental result @xcite which can not be gained from the nasch model is the occurance of metastable states near the density of maximum flow .",
    "very recently such states have been found in a modified version of the nasch model where a limited braking capacity of the cars and a continuous space is considered @xcite .",
    "the continuous space allows very small amplitudes of the fluctuations compared to the discrete nasch model .",
    "therefore one could ask if a continuous space is neccessary to obtain metastable states .    here",
    "we present the results of a numerical investigation of two variants on the nasch model with modified acceleration rules , which are still discrete in time and space .",
    "first , we assigned a larger braking probability to stopped cars and second , we analysed the modification suggested by takayasu and takayasu @xcite .",
    "it turns out that metastable states can be found in both cases .",
    "in this part of the investigation we consider the nasch model with maximum velocity @xmath0 and braking probability @xmath1 of the moving cars .",
    "in contrast to the original model , a higher value @xmath2 of the braking probability is assigned to stopped cars .",
    "we performed simulation runs for periodic systems containing @xmath3 lattice sites .",
    "this system size is sufficient to exclude finite size effects for the chosen set of parameters .",
    "[ fund_nasch ] shows the fundamental diagram of the modified model . obviously the average flow @xmath4 can take two values in the density interval between @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependent on the chosen initialisation .",
    "the larger values of the average flow can be obtained using a homogeneous initialisation of the system .",
    "the lower branch is obtained starting from a complete jammed state .",
    "moreover varying the particle number adiabatically , one can trace a hysteresis loop .",
    "one gets the upper branch by adding cars to the stationary state with @xmath7 and the lower one by removing cars from the stationary state with @xmath8 . for a fixed value of @xmath9",
    ", @xmath10 depends linearly on @xmath11 for wide a range of parameters .",
    "the microscopic structure of the jammed states in the modified model differs from those found in the nasch model .",
    "while jammed states in the nasch model contain with an exponential size - distribution @xcite , one can find phase separation in the modified model .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is the reduction of the outflow from a jam .",
    "therefore the density in the free flow regime is smaller than the density of maximum flow and cars can propagate freely in the low density part of the lattice . due to the reduction of the density in the free flow regime , no spontaneous formation of jams is observable in the stationary state , if fluctuations in the free flow regime are rare .",
    "this picture can be confirmed by a simple phenomenological approach .",
    "obviously the flow in the homogeneous branch is given by @xmath12 , because every car can move with its desired velocity @xmath13 .",
    "assuming that the high density states are phase separated , we can obtain the second branch of the fundamental diagram .",
    "the phase separated states consist of a large jam and a free flow regime , where each car moves with velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the density in the free flow regime @xmath15 is determined by the average waiting time @xmath16 of the first car in the jam and @xmath14 , because neglecting interactions between cars the average distance of two consecutive cars is given by @xmath17 . using the normalisation @xmath18 ( @xmath19 number of cars in the free flow regime ( jam ) ) we find that the flow is given by @xmath20 obviously @xmath15 is precisely the branching density @xmath21 , because for densities below @xmath15 the jamlength is zero .",
    "it should be noted that this approach is only valid if ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 holds .",
    "small values of @xmath9 have to be considered in order to avoid interaction between cars due to the velocity fluctuations and @xmath24 , because otherwise cars can stop spontaneous in the free flow regime and therefore initiate a jam .",
    "measurements of the average flow show that the lower branch of the fundamental diagram is not stable near the density @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we performed a more detailed stability analysis of the homogeneous and the jammed state near @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "near @xmath21 the large jam present in the initial configuration resolves , the average length decays exponentially in time ( fig .",
    "[ jam_length ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that this behaviour is not the consequence of a continuous `` melting '' of the large jam .",
    "in contrast , the jamlength is strongly fluctuating without any systematic time - dependence .",
    "once a homogeneous state without a jammed car is reached , no jam appears again .",
    "therefore the homogeneous state is stable near @xmath21 .",
    "analogous to the metastable jammed states near @xmath21 , homogeneous initialisations for densities slightly above @xmath25 lead to metastable homogeneous states with short lifetimes .",
    "[ st_diag ] shows the spontaneous formation of jams due to velocity fluctuations .",
    "the finite lifetimes of the homogeneous states are the qualitative difference between this model and the cruise - control limit @xcite , where the time evolution of homogeneous states at low densities is completely deterministic .",
    "takayasu and takayasu ( t@xmath26 ) @xcite suggested a cellular automaton model with another type of a slow - to - start rule , which is defined as follows : a standing car with exactly one empty cell in front of it accelerates with probability @xmath27 , while all other cars accelerate deterministicly .",
    "the other update rules of the nasch model are unchanged . due to this modification already for @xmath28",
    "the particle - hole symmetry is broken .    in fig .",
    "[ t2_fund ] we show the fundamental diagram for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , i.e. stopped cars can only move if there are at least two empty cells in front of it .",
    "obviously completely blocked states exist for densities @xmath31 , where the number of empty cells in front of each car is smaller than two .",
    "since fluctuations are absent in those states , they have an infinite lifetime .",
    "therefore the flow in the stationary state is zero .",
    "although the states with a finite flow are not stationary , typically one has to perform an extremely large number of update steps until the flow vanishes for large system sizes and densities slightly above @xmath32 , because the number of blocked configurations is very small compared to the total number of configurations . precisely at @xmath32 ,",
    "the blocked state is unique and the typical time to reach this state diverges exponentially with the system size .",
    "therefore we used very small systems in order to obtain the lower branch of the fundamental diagram .",
    "another interesting feature is the form of the fundamental diagram .",
    "there is some experimental evidence that in certain situations the shape of the fundamental diagram differs from the standard convex form .",
    "this behaviour of the average flow can be easily obtained tuning the parameter @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis of two modifications of the nasch model shows that metastable states can also be found in ca models for traffic flow .",
    "the nasch model with slow - to - start rule shows the coexistence of phase separated and homogeneous states in a density interval near the density @xmath25 of maximum flow . near @xmath25 interactions between cars become important and one can find spontaneous formation of jams .",
    "therefore the reduction of the density in the outflow regime of a jam leads to stable phase separated states .",
    "the reduction of interactions between cars in the free flow regime can be confirmed by a phenomenological approach , which gives very accurate results .",
    "in contrast to the cruise - control limit of the nasch model @xcite , where also metastable states can be found , fluctuations are present in both coexisting states .",
    "finally we mention that this modified version of the nasch model can reproduce the fundamental diagram of the spacecontinuous approach by krau et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath30 limit of the @xmath34 model we find metastable states for densities beyond @xmath35 . for @xmath36 states with a finite flow",
    "have very large lifetimes , but if the system reaches a blocked state these states are stable because of the absence of fluctuations",
    ". therefore the @xmath30 limit of the @xmath34 model is complementary to the cruise - control limit of the nasch model , where one finds the absence of fluctuations for homogeneous states at low densities .",
    "these modifications of the nasch model show that ca models for traffic can reproduce a broad spectrum of experimental results although the update rules oversimplify the individual behaviour of the drivers ."
