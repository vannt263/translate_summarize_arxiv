    "electromagnetic properties of heavy ion collisions , and in particular phenomena related to the presence of strong em fields in the course of the nucleus - nucleus reaction , attract an evident interest in the community . while a large number of inspiring papers could be cited here , only two will be addressed below , as two different but highly interesting examples .",
    "firstly , a proposal for the estimation of the electric conductivity of the quark gluon plasma , by using the electric field resulting from the charge difference between the colliding cu and au nuclei was made by hirono , hongo and hirano  @xcite . secondly , a study of electric currents acting in the qgp , and induced by the magnetic fields present in au+au and pb+pb reactions , recently became available from grsoy , kharzeev and rajagopal  @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the sensitivity of azimuthal asymmetries in particle emission , and in particular directed flow denotes the emitted particle s azimuthal angle while @xmath1 gives the orientation of the reaction plane . ] @xmath2 , to electromagnetic phenomena acting in heavy ion collisions was pointed out by the authors .",
    "this corroborates with the results of our recent work on peripheral pb+pb collisions  @xcite , where the influence of the electromagnetic interaction between the spectator systems and the charged final state pions was quantified .",
    "our work demonstrated that this interaction could induce sizeable values of directed flow , and could be used as a new source of information on the space - time evolution of pion production .",
    "this finding was quite similar to what we established earlier for @xmath3 ratios at high values of rapidity  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic effects on particle emission clearly imply the dependence of specific observables on particle charge , in particular also for particles of the same mass ( like e.g. @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons ) .",
    "such a charge dependence for specific components of pion directed flow was indeed predicted in  @xcite , as well as by us in  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the importance of experimental data on directed flow measured _ separately _ for positive and negative pion charges ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) becomes clearly evident .",
    "such data is still , at the present moment , rather scarce .",
    "the star collaboration  @xcite is , to the best of our knowledge , the first and unique experimental group in high energy heavy ion physics to provide such data simultaneously for positively and negatively charged pions and @xmath5 . ] .",
    "final data of the star collaboration on the directed flow of protons , antiprotons and pions in the au+au collision energy range from @xmath0 up to 200  gev have recently been published  @xcite .",
    "these include measurements of @xmath8 for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , made altogether for seven collision energies in the c.m.s .",
    "rapidity range of @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , at lower values of @xmath12 the comparison of positive and negative pion directed flow in intermediate centrality ( 10 - 40% ) au+au collisions displays a splitting of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath13 at positive rapidity . as remarked both in  @xcite and by us in  @xcite ,",
    "this is consistent with the expectation of a specific charge - dependent component of directed flow , induced by electromagnetic effects .",
    "while already in  @xcite , we stated our idea of this effect being caused by the spectator - induced em field , we feel that a more in - depth verification of this hypothesis is in place .",
    "it is indeed of importance to verify whether the electromagnetic interaction between spectator charges and _ final state _ pions can have the right magnitude to explain the observed splitting of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and , if this is indeed the case , to establish what conclusions can be drawn on that basis for the space - time evolution of the collision dynamics .",
    "this is even more important in view of the predictions made in  @xcite of the link between charged currents in the quark gluon plasma and the charge splitting of directed flow .",
    "the relatively straight - forward electromagnetic effect on final state pions studied by us can indeed be considered as a _",
    "baseline _ for these more untrivial phenomena related to the electric conductivity of the qgp .    in this context",
    ", the aim of the present paper is to estimate the effect of the spectator - induced electromagnetic field on the directed flow of charged final state pions .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the discussion of the charge splitting apparent in star data is made in section  [ stardata ] .",
    "the description of our numerical monte carlo tool , used to estimate the electromagnetic component of directed flow , is presented in section  [ model ] .",
    "the results of our monte carlo simulation , as well as their comparison to the star data , are discussed in section  [ results ] . in section  [ implications ] , we compare our results with these coming from our earlier studies , and comment on other effects that could induce charge - dependent pion directed flow .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the results of the star collaboration on charged pion directed flow in au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev are shown in fig .  [",

    "the numerical values from  @xcite are redrawn as a function of the scaled pion rapidity , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the rapidity of the incoming nucleus in the collision c.m .",

    "as specified in  @xcite , the presented experimental data are obtained within a lower cut on pion transverse momentum , @xmath16  gev / c , and an upper cut on pion total momentum , @xmath17  gev / c .",
    "three facts are immediately apparent from the figure :    1 .   at this relatively low collision energy ,",

    "3 .   a minor deviation from antisymmetry about mid - rapidity is visible for the data points , in particular at the edges of the covered kinematical range .",

    ", we assume that the total values of positive and negative pion @xmath8 can be approximated by the sum of two terms :    @xmath18    @xmath19    where the first , dominant , charge - independent term @xmath20 corresponds to the total directed flow imposed by the strong interaction ( e.g. , by the hydrodynamical evolution of the system ) , while the second , smaller and charge - dependent term @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is induced by electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the approximate additivity postulated in ( [ eq : v1pi+ ] ) and ( [ eq : v1pi- ] ) was verified by monte carlo calculations , somewhat simplified but similar to these described in section  [ model ] .    from our earlier studies",
    "@xcite , as well as from monte carlo simulations performed for the present work ( section  [ results ] ) , we know that in the range of rapidity considered here , the spectator - induced electromagnetic component of directed flow is , at least to a good approximation , opposite for opposite charges",
    ". thus we postulate :    @xmath23    by solving ( [ eq : v1pi+])-([eq : v1piem ] ) , we conclude that the electromagnetic component of the directed flow presented in fig .  [ fig : stardata ] can be obtained as :    @xmath24    @xmath25    this is shown in fig .",

    "the resulting values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 consistently reach up to about 0.002 , with the exception of one asymmetric outlier visible at the low edge of the covered kinematical range .",
    "this we regard as an experimental uncertainty as specified in point 3 .  above .",
    "we conclude that the overall precision of the star data is sufficient to identify the - relatively small - electromagnetic component of directed flow . as we will demonstrate in the subsequent parts of this paper , the magnitude of this electromagnetic component ( fig .",

    "pion emission_. as this will be shown in section  [ results ] , our maximal simplification of initial conditions determining pion emission ( i.e. , the reduction of the emission zone to a single point in space and in time ) gives a convenient way to estimate the sensitivity of the electromagnetic component of directed flow to the space - time evolution of the heavy ion reaction . in the present work , we will mostly focus on its sensitivity to the distance between the emitted pions and the spectator system as indicated in fig .",

    "indeed , our work suggests that the electromagnetic interaction between spectators and final state pions is , alone , sufficient to explain the charge splitting of directed flow present in the star data  @xcite , with no apparent necessity to involve phenomena related to the electric conductivity of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this was demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : allde ] and most of all in fig .",
    "[ fig : datamodel ] . as we take our electromagnetic effect on final state pions as a straight - forward and _",
    "unavoidable _ consequence of the presence of spectator charges in the collision , it seems to us that this effect must be considered as a baseline whenever postulating any more sophisticated phenomenon as the one discussed in  @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies , involving in particular also the energy dependence of our effect on final state pions , are necessary in order to get more insight into the possible interplay between these two effects as a function of collision centrality and energy .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the present work was the first analysis of the role played by the spectator - induced electromagnetic interaction in building up the directed flow of charged final state pions produced at central rapidities .",
    "this analysis was limited to the spectator - final state pion em interaction and did not include more sophisticated phenomena related to the electrical conductivity of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "on the basis of our numerical simulation , and assuming intermediate centrality au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev , we conclude that the spectator - induced electromagnetic interaction can result in a charge splitting of @xmath4 and @xmath5 directed flow which will come on top of phenomena resulting from the strong interactions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : v1pi+ ] ,  [ eq : v1pi- ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of this charge splitting appears to strongly depend on the actual distance between the pion emission site ( pion at freeze - out ) and the spectator system . as such , this effect brings new , independent information on the space - time evolution of pion production .    in the extreme case of `` immediate '' pion production ,",
    "the spectator - induced electromagnetic interaction would induce a maximal charge splitting of @xmath6 and @xmath7 which could reach up to @xmath87 in the considered range of rapidity ( as apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : allde ] ) . the charge - dependent component of directed flow , extracted from the experimental star data  @xcite and fairly well described by our simulation , suggests a much lower value for this charge splitting , up to about @xmath88 ( as apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : datamodel ] ) .    adjusting our simulation to fit the experimental star data , and from the comparison of the present analysis to our earlier studies made for pions at higher rapidity , we formulate conclusions on the evolution of the pion emission distance as a function of rapidity .",
    "the distance between the pion emission at freeze - out and the spectator system appears to decrease with increasing pion rapidity , reflecting the longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "thus for the first time , information on the space - time characteristics of the strongly - interacting system created in the collision is being provided by means of the spectator - induced electromagnetic interaction .    finally , we comment on the effects of electric currents induced in the qgp and studied in ref .",
    "the magnitude of our em effect on final state pions being largely sufficient to describe the charge splitting of directed flow apparent in the star data  @xcite , we think that this effect should be taken as a baseline whenever considering any more sophisticated phenomenon like the one discussed in  @xcite .",
    "further , more advanced studies are needed in order to differentiate between these two effects .",
