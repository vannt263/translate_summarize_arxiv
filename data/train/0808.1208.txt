    "phase mixing is a mechanism of enhanced dissipation of alfvn waves due to inhomogeneity of alfvn speed in a direction transverse to a local magnetic field .",
    "this mechanism originally was studied in the fusion and laboratory plasma context by a number of authors @xcite and subsequently applied to the solar corona .",
    "most of the large amount of work done in the field of phase mixing was in the resistive mhd ( magnetohydrodynamic ) regime .",
    "recently , a few works looked at the same mechanism in the collisionless regime in the context of earth magnetosphere @xcite and solar corona .",
    "the main findings of these works include the generation of electric field that is parallel to the ambient magnetic field in the regions of transverse density inhomogeneity , as well as associated electron acceleration .",
    "it should be mentioned that these studies considered circularly polarised ion cyclotron ( ic ) waves which in the low frequency regime become alfvn waves .",
    "we use terms alfvn or ic interchangeably , but reader should bear in mind we always refer to _ waves with frequencies @xmath0 _ ( with @xmath1 being ion cyclotron frequency ) .",
    "the exact mechanism of generation of the parallel electric field has stimulated a debate , and even mhd regime option was explored . continuing this investigation , here we apply technique used in the collisionless reconnection @xcite .",
    "namely , in section 3.1 we use generalised ohm s law to find out which term generates the parallel electric field .",
    "solar flare observations @xcite trigger one s interest in how effectively plasma particles are accelerated .",
    "hence , in section 3.2 we look into how the generated parallel electric field and the fraction of accelerated electrons depend on model parameters such as ic wave frequency , amplitude , and plasma beta .    ref . provides a simple analytical expression how alfvn wave amplitude should decay in space due to the phase mixing .",
    "despite the fact that their formula is derived in the resistive mhd regime , we still apply it to our collisionless , kinetic simulation and see what does the comparison yield ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "this is done in the light of previous results of who established that in the collisionless , kinetic regime alfvn wave amplitude in the density gradient regions decays with distance ( from where it is driven ) according to collisional mhd formula of . here",
    "we stretch the mhd - kinetic analogy further to test @xmath2 dependence under the exponent .    in sect 3.4",
    "we estimate the effective `` resistivity '' ( again the spirit of mhd - kinetic analogy ) .",
    "the quotation marks are needed to signify that pic ( particle - in - cell ) simulation code is collisionless and hence no resistive effects exist as such .",
    "however , scattering of particles by magnetic fields plays effective role of collisions .",
    "in our numerical simulations we use 2.5d , relativistic , fully electromagnetic pic code .",
    "the initial conditions , basic parameters and boundary conditions are exactly the same as in the previous work by .",
    "in particular , the uniform magnetic field is in @xmath3-direction , the transverse density inhomogeneity is across @xmath4-direction .",

    "@xmath34 is the onset time of the driver , which was fixed at @xmath35 i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the driver onset time is about 3 ion - cyclotron periods .",
    "imposing such a current on the system results in the generation of left circularly polarised ic ( alfvnic ) wave , which is driven at the left boundary of simulation box and has spatial driver width of @xmath37 .",
    "the wave propagates along @xmath3-coordinate and generates the parallel electric field in the density gradient regions ( for more details see ) .",

    "is to investigate the parameter space of the problem , the following range of physical parameters was used : we vary the frequency , amplitude of ic wave or the plasma beta .",
    "the driving wave frequency @xmath41 ranged from @xmath42 to @xmath43 with a step of @xmath42 .",
    "the wave amplitude @xmath40 was also set at @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "( 2)-(5 ) typically takes about 7 - 10 days on 64 parallel processors .",
    "in order to understand details of the parallel electric field generation process , we now focus on the question : which term in the generalised ohm s law is responsible for the generation of the parallel electric field ?",
    "the generalised ohm s law can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are electric and magnetic fields , @xmath56 is plasma velocity , @xmath57 is pressure tensor ( @xmath58 matrix ) , @xmath59 is plasma number density , @xmath60 is mass and @xmath61 is electric charge .",
    "the subscript @xmath61 refers to an electron . normalising space coordinate by @xmath10 , fluid velocity by alfvn speed ( at the lowest density region ) @xmath62 , time by alfvn transit time @xmath63 , magnetic field by @xmath64 , electric field by @xmath65 , number density by @xmath21 and pressure tensor by @xmath66 , a dimensionless version of eq .",
    "( [ g_ohms ] ) can be obtained @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the normalised ion skin depth ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "note that strictly speaking we should have used tildes in eq .",
    "( [ nd_g_ohms ] ) to denote dimensionless quantities , but we omit them for brevity .",
    "let us focus on the parallel electric field , @xmath70 , which is generated in the density gradient regions by phase mixing .",
    "it is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath6 is assumed because of spatially 2 dimensional model .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the different term profiles ( along the uniform magnetic field in @xmath3-direction ) in the generalised ohm s law ( eq .  ( [ g_ohms_ex ] ) ) : ( a ) @xmath70 , ( b ) @xmath72 , ( c ) @xmath73 , and ( d ) @xmath74 in the maximum density gradient region @xmath75 at @xmath76 for the case , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath19 . the time derivative term in fig .  [ fig1](d )",
    "is calculated from @xmath79 to @xmath80 ( time interval corresponds to the inverse of electron plasma frequency @xmath81 ) .",
    "the other terms in right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ g_ohms_ex ] ) are negligible . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the parallel electric field is clearly observed in the density gradient regions where phase mixing can occur .",
    "it should be noted that no parallel electric field is seen away from the density gradient regions . according to the generalised ohm s law",
    ", there has to be a term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ g_ohms_ex ] ) that supports this electric field .    by comparing fig .  [ fig1](a ) to fig .",
    "[ fig1](b - d ) it is clear that the parallel electric field ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) is supported mostly by the electron pressure tensor ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) , with a smaller contribution from the electron inertia term ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that previous results on collisionless reconnection both in tearing unstable harris current sheet @xcite and stressed x - point collapse @xcite have shown that the term in the generalised ohm s law that is responsible for breaking the frozen - in condition , i.e. that supports out - of - plane electric field is electron pressure tensor . here",
    "the electron pressure tensor supports ( generates ) the parallel electric field .",
    "thus , one should note a universal importance of the electron pressure tensor in relation to supporting the electric fields in collisionless plasmas .      to estimate how efficiently the parallel electric field is generated by phase mixing , as a function of model parameters , we introduce the average of the absolute value of the parallel electric field in the density gradient region : @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "note that in what follows the normalisation of the electric field is different from section 3.1 where , usual for the generalised ohm s law , `` fluid '' normalisation ( @xmath65 ) is used .",
    "normalisation @xmath83 is usually referred to as `` electrostatic '' . by using the definition given by eq.([e_star ] ) we can evaluate quantitatively the electric field generated in the density gradient region . although there are two density regions in our simulation box because of the periodic boundary condition , we focus on the lower one ( the physics of the upper and the lower regions is essentially the same ) .",
    "the range from @xmath84 to @xmath85 indicates the density gradient .",
    "see for details .    also , in order to investigate the fraction of accelerated electrons by the generated parallel electric field , we use particle data in the density gradient at lower side ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we count the number of electrons with velocities greater than the thermal velocity ( @xmath87 ) in the electron velocity distribution function , in the @xmath3-direction , at the final time snapshot @xmath88 , and divide this by the total number of particles ( with @xmath89 ) in the same domain : @xmath90 here it was to enough to integrate only positive region in this distribution because electron acceleration was symmetrical in the @xmath3-direction . note that the initial velocity distribution function is nearly maxwellian . to maintain the balance of the total kinetic pressure throughout the system ,",
    "the particle thermal velocity in the dense plasma region ( @xmath91 ) is lower than the outside region ( @xmath92 or @xmath93 ) ( see for details fig.(4 ) from ) .",
    "however , in order to use eq .",
    "( [ n_acc ] ) , we had to estimate an appropriate velocity corresponding to the thermal velocity in the maxwellian .",
    "fortunately , initial electron velocity distribution function did not deviate much from the exact maxwellian .",
    "therefore , we adopted the standard thermal velocity which was set to @xmath94% of @xmath95 .",
    "recall that @xmath96 , where @xmath21 is the peak number at @xmath97 in maxwellian .",
    "the choice of diagnostic for characterizing the degree of particle acceleration needs a further clarification .",
    "eq.(5 ) provides number of electrons with speed @xmath7 exceeding the thermal speed @xmath14 as a fraction of total distribution value .",
    "however , in a maxwellian plasma 16% of the electrons have @xmath98 ( for @xmath99 ) .",
    "thus , it may be tempting to either : ( i ) subtract this 16% from our diagnostic in eq.(5 ) or ( ii ) try to fit a maxwellian to the electron distribution at the final simulation time step ( after all the acceleration has taken place ) and then count the number of electrons that have speeds @xmath100 . our motivation to keep the definition given by eq.(5 )",
    "is two - fold : ( i ) in context of the solar flare observations in x - rays , one always infers the integrated spectrum averaged over some volume @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 ( where @xmath59 is electron number density ) and it is impossible to subtract the above mentioned 16% without introducing additional uncertainties due to the unknown density and poorly known emitting volume , due to a line of sight effect ( dr . e. kontar of university of glasgow , private communication ) , see also refs .",
    "hence the definition given by eq.(5 ) is more appropriate for comparison of theory with the observations .",
    "also , this is particularly timely because the acceleration of electrons by alfvnic waves in flares have been recently studied @xcite .",
    "( ii ) although the electron distribution function at the initial time step is nearly maxwellian ( despite density and temperature transverse inhomogeneities ) , at the final stages of the simulation the deviations from the maxwellian form are large and hence a fit to a maxwellian , in order to calculate @xmath14 , and in turn to count the super - thermal particles above that value ( @xmath100 ) , is impractical .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) shows the generated parallel electric field , @xmath103 , and the fraction of accelerated electrons , @xmath104 as function of driving frequency of the ic wave ( normalised to @xmath1 ) .",
    "the wave frequency @xmath41 was set at @xmath105 and @xmath43 .",
    "the wave amplitude and plasma beta were fixed at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we gather from fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) that the generated parallel electric field and the fraction of accelerated electrons are independent of the ic wave frequency remaining at a level of six orders of magnitude larger than the dreicer value and approximately 20 % respectively .",
    "this conclusion is based on the following estimate @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 v m@xmath39 ( note that here solar coronal number density of @xmath108 m@xmath109 was used ) . the dreicer electric field ( which is associated with the particle acceleration run - away regime @xcite ) , @xmath110 , for @xmath111 mk ( and hence @xmath112 ) is @xmath113 v m@xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath114 .",
    "this result should be taken with caution because it is obtained with the ion - electron mass ratio of 16 .",
    "as shown by @xcite ( see their figure 7 ) that attained amplitude of the generated parallel electric field scales strongly as @xmath115 .",
    "next , we explore how the generated parallel electric field and the fraction of accelerated electrons depend on driving ic wave amplitude .",
    "the latter , @xmath40 , was set at @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the wave frequency and plasma beta were fixed at @xmath77 and @xmath19 .",
    "we gather from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the generated parallel electric field and the fraction of accelerated electrons increase with the increase of ic wave amplitude .",
    "this seems as a reasonable result because larger amplitude waves have more energy to give to electrons .",
    "also , non - linear effects would be progressively important .",
    "we also explored the plasma beta dependence .",
    "the plasma beta was set at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the wave frequency and amplitude were fixed at @xmath77 and @xmath18 .",
    "the plasma beta is defined as @xmath116 .",
    "we altered the plasma beta by changing the electron thermal velocity , affecting the plasma kinetic pressure .",
    "therefore , in this simulation , magnetic pressure is kept constant while plasma kinetic pressure varies .",
    "[ fig4](a ) does not show any correlation between plasma beta and the parallel electric field generation .",
    "incidentally , investigated plasma beta dependence of the fast magnetosonic wave amplitude , which is generated in a transversely inhomogeneous medium when an alfvnic pulse is launched ( using mhd numerical simulation ) . according to fig .",
    "9(b ) in , the maximum fast magnetosonic wave amplitude also does not depend on plasma beta .",
    "alluded to the relation between the non - linear fast magnetosonic wave and parallel electric field generation .",
    "hence it is not surprising that in our fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we do not see plasma beta dependence .",
    "what is surprising , at the first glance , in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , is that the fraction of accelerated particles strongly depends on beta . in particular ,",
    "a decrease in beta ( for @xmath117 ) yields as large percentage as @xmath118% !",
    "one can conjecture that this is due to the fact the in the case of small plasma beta , magnetic effects dominate over thermal ones , and because ic wave is essentially a magnetic - type perturbation , electrons respond better to the wave influence and accelerate more efficiently .",
    "established that in the collisionless , kinetic regime alfvn ( ic ) wave amplitude in density gradient region decays with distance ( from where it is driven ) according to collisional mhd formula of @xmath119 ,    \\label{mhd_decay_law}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is resistivity ( divided by @xmath121 , i.e. by @xmath120 we mean @xmath122 , @xmath123 is ( driving ) wave frequency , @xmath124 is alfvn velocity and @xmath3 is the axis which aw propagates .",
    "recall that plasma density inhomogeneity is a function of @xmath4 and wave propagates in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "in particular , ( see for details left panel of fig.6 in ) it was shown that , at a fixed time instance corresponding to well - developed phase mixing , @xmath125 .",
    "in other words , one can define an empirical dissipation length , @xmath126 , according to collisional mhd formula ( eq.([mhd_decay_law ] ) ) in the collisionless , kinetic regime .",
    "applicability of the mhd formula in the kinetic regime was rather surprising .",
    "we now turn back to the previous results in order to see how far this mhd - kinetic analogy can be stretched . in particular , one can e.g. check the @xmath2 scaling in the eq.([mhd_decay_law ] ) . for this purpose , after simple algebra applied to @xmath127 $ ] , for fixed @xmath128 and @xmath124 , one can obtain the following scaling @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is some constant .",
    "hence the slope of a log - log graph of dissipation length @xmath126 versus @xmath123 is expected to be @xmath131 .",
    "[ fig5 ] presents the dissipation length ( distance over which the wave damps ) dependence on the ic wave frequency .",
    "the values in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] were obtained from line data of magnetic field @xmath132 in the maximum plasma gradient @xmath133 at @xmath134 for @xmath135 , @xmath136 for @xmath77 , @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "the reason for the different snapshot times is that we only consider well - developed phase mixing , i.e. when ic wave is fully damped . as in left panel of fig.6 in ) we fit @xmath141 to @xmath142 and obtain empirical dissipation length @xmath126 .",
    "we gather from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the slope is @xmath143 contrary to the above prediction of @xmath131 .    to address the inconsistency we conjecture that the resistivity might be variable .",
    "one can estimate the resistivity for each case of driving wave frequency considered , by calculating @xmath144 .",
    "we reiterate that strictly speaking pic simulation code is collisionless and hence no resistive effects exist .",
    "however , scattering of particles by magnetic fields plays effective role of collisions .",
    "when resistivity is mentioned we refer to `` effective '' resistivity . normalising the frequency by ic frequency @xmath1 , length by ion skin depth @xmath145 and velocity by speed of light @xmath52 , the dimensionless resistivity is given by , @xmath146 } \\nonumber \\\\    & &    \\exp \\left[2 \\left ( \\frac{y - y_c}{l } \\right)^6 \\right ]    \\left ( \\frac{y - y_c}{l } \\right)^{-10}.    \\label{eta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can now put in the known parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 into eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) . here",
    "@xmath150 and @xmath151 are the width and the centre of plasma density gradient , respectively .",
    "therefore the dimensionless resistivity can be estimated using @xmath152 as the driving wave frequency and the dissipation length for each case are given by choice and empirically , respectively , one can obtain the resistivity by substituting above values into eq .",
    "( [ eta_pic ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath153 ( for @xmath135 ) , @xmath154 ( for @xmath155 ) , @xmath156 ( for @xmath157 ) and @xmath158 ( for @xmath159 ) .",
    "thus our initial conjecture that the effective resistivity depends on the driving ic wave frequency turns out to be correct .",
    "but the main conclusion of this analysis is that despite collisional mhd scaling eq.([mhd_decay_law ] ) being applicable to the collisionless , kinetic regime of phase mixing , i.e. @xmath125 scaling holds , stretching the mhd - kinetic analogy further to @xmath2 dependence under the exponent is not valid ( due to the effective resistivity being a function of @xmath123 ) .",
    "issue of anomalous resistivity is central for many space and laboratory plasma applications",
    ". it can facilitate fast magnetic reconnection via petschek type mechanism ( if @xmath120 is not spatially uniform ) , or have significant implications for wave heating models of solar corona where normal spitzer resistivity is too small to produce any sizable effect .",
    "ref.@xcite presented plasma resistivity measurements in the reconnection current sheet of magnetic reconnection experiment ( mrx ) ( see ref.@xcite for details of the experimental setup ) .",
    "they established that in the collisionless regime measured resistivity values can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the spitzer value @xcite .",
    "let us apply our pic simulation results to see if there is any evidence for the anomalous effective resistivity .",
    "we fix physical parameters corresponding to solar coronal plasmas : @xmath160 and plasma number density @xmath161 , i.e. @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
