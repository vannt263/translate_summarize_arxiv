    "there is direct evidence that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by disk accretion onto supermassive black holes .",

    "sufficiently to actually see a @xmath0-scale disk of ionized gas in orbit about an unseen mass of @xmath1 , presumed to be a supermassive black hole ( ford et al , 1994 ; harms et al , 1994 ) .",
    "the fact that this gas disk is approximately normal to the famous relativistic jet displayed by this object is circumstantial evidence that it is , indeed , the outer regions of the accretion disk that powers this agn . in another important case , radio observations of megamasers in the spiral galaxy ngc  4258 ( m106 ) reveal an almost perfectly keplerian @xmath2 gas disk orbiting a compact object with mass @xmath3 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; greenhill et al .",
    "1995 ) .    even before the observational evidence for black hole accretion disks became compelling",
    ", the basic theory of such disks had been extensively developed .",
    "building upon the non - relativistic theory of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , novikov & thorne ( 1974 ) and page & thorne ( 1974 ) developed the `` standard '' model of a geometrically - thin , radiatively - efficient , steady - state , viscous accretion disk around an isolated kerr black hole .",
    "in addition to the assumptions already listed , it is assumed that the viscous torque operating within the disk becomes zero at the radius of marginal stability , @xmath4 .",
    "physically , this was justified by assuming that the accretion flow would pass through a sonic point close to @xmath4 and hence flow ballistically ( i.e. , `` plunge '' ) into the black hole .    even while setting up this boundary condition ,",
    "page & thorne ( 1974 ) noted that magnetic fields may allow this zero - torque boundary condition ( ztbc ) to be violated .",
    "given the modern viewpoint of accretion disks , that the very `` viscosity '' driving accretion is due to magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , the idea that the ztbc can be violated has been revived by recent theoretical work , starting with gammie ( 1999 ) and krolik ( 1999a ) . in independent treatments , these authors show that significant energy and angular momentum can be extracted from matter within the radius of marginal stability via magnetic connections with the main body of the accretion disk .",
    "agol & krolik ( 2000 ) have performed the formal extension of the standard model to include a torque at @xmath4 and show that the extra dissipation associated with this torque produces a very centrally concentrated dissipation profile .",
    "as shown by gammie ( 1999 ) , agol & krolik ( 2000 ) , and li ( 2002 ) , this process can lead to an extraction ( and subsequent dissipation ) of spin energy and angular momentum from the rotating black hole by the accretion disk . in these cases ,",
    "the magnetic forces might be capable of placing the innermost part of the flow on negative energy orbits , allowing a penrose process to be realized ( we note that williams [ 2003 ] has also argued for the importance of a non - magnetic , particle - particle and particle - photon scattering mediated penrose process ) .",
    "a second mechanism by which the central accretion disk can be torqued is via a direct magnetic connection between the inner accretion disk and the ( rotating ) event horizon of the black hole . in this case ,",
    "as long as the angular velocity of the event horizon exceeds that of the inner disk , energy and angular momentum of the spinning black hole can be extracted via the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "we note that field lines that directly connect the rotating event horizon with the body of the accretion disk through the plunging region _ are _ seen in recent general relativistic mhd simulations of black hole accretion ( e.g. , hirose et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "interest in these torqued relativistic disks has received a boost from recent x - ray observations .",
    "the x - ray spectra of many agn ( and , indeed , galactic black hole candidates ) reveal the signatures of `` x - ray reflection '' from optically - thick matter . in some cases ,",
    "examination of these features allows us to detect strong doppler and gravitational shifts indicative of circular motion close to a black hole ( fabian et al .",

    "2000 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the observed range of doppler and gravitational shifts can be used to map the x - ray emission / irradiation across the surface of the accretion disk . the _ xmm - newton _",

    "( 1996 ) , the x - ray reflection features were found to be extremely broad .",
    "the degree of gravitational redshifting required the majority of the x - ray emission to emerge within a radius of @xmath5 from a near - extremal kerr black hole ( i.e. , a black hole with a spin parameter of @xmath6 ) .",
    "as explicitly shown in reynolds et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , it is very problematic to explain these data within the framework of the standard accretion disk model .",
    "fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) and miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) suggest that gravitational focusing of the primary continuum x - rays might produce such a centrally - concentrated emissivity profile",
    ". alternatively , reynolds et al .",
    "( 2004 ) has shown that a torqued disk can readily explain the deep minimum spectrum provided the source is assumed to be in a torque - dominated state ( or , in the terminology of agol & krolik [ 2000 ] , an `` infinite - efficiency '' state ) whereby the power associated with the innermost torque is instantaneously dominating the accretion power .",
    "in other words , the x - ray data suggest that during this deep minimum state of mcg6 - 30 - 15 the power derived from the black hole spin greatly exceeds that derived from accretion .    of course",
    ", this state of affairs can not last forever or else the central black hole in mcg6 - 30 - 15 would spin down to a point where it could no longer provide this power . at some point in its history , the system must be in an accretion - dominated phase in which the black hole is spun up . however , even in its spin - dominated state , the spin - down timescale of the central black hole is of the order of 100 million years or more .",
    "thus we could envisage a situation in which the system shines via a quasi - steady - state , spin - dominated accretion disk .",
    "there are hints , though , that accretion disks may switch between spin - dominated and accretion - dominated on much shorter timescales . in its normal spectral state , the x - ray reflection features in mcg6 - 30 - 15 are much less centrally concentrated than in the deep minimum state , suggesting that the normal state might be accretion - dominated .",
    "it is also important to note that this system can switch between its normal state and the deep minimum state in as little as 510ksec ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , which corresponds to only a few dynamical timescales of the inner accretion disk .",
    "thus it is of interest to consider the physics of an accretion disk that undergoes a rapid torquing event .",

    "in section 2 we will begin our study of sporadically torqued accretion disks by investigating an analytic solution for a torqued newtonian disk . in section 3 ,",
    "we generalize to the fully relativistic equations and obtain numerical solutions . in section 4 , we relate our results with the observed properties of the `` deep minimum state '' of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , and consequently discuss the effect that a torquing event may have on the physics of the x - ray emitting disk corona .",
    "in particular , we suggest that the enhanced returning radiation associated with a torquing event might suppress 0.510kev coronal emission in all but the inner portion of the disk .",
    "section 5 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "we begin our investigation of sporadically torqued disks via the study of a simple case that lends itself to a straightforward analytic solution .",
    "we shall construct a model of a radiatively - efficient accretion disk following the usual approach of pringle ( 1981 ) .",
    "we shall assume that the accretion disk is axisymmetric , geometrically - thin and in keplerian motion about a point - mass @xmath7 .",
    "using a cylindrical polar coordinate system @xmath8 with the axis passing through the central mass normal to the disk plane , we shall denote the surface density of the disk by @xmath9 , the angular velocity of the disk about @xmath7 as @xmath10 and the radial velocity of the disk material as @xmath11 .",
    "the equations that determine the structure of the thin disk assuming radiative efficiency are mass and angular momentum conservation , @xmath12 @xmath13 respectively , where @xmath14 is the torque exerted by the disk _ outside _ of radius @xmath15 on the disk _ inside _ of that radius .    in standard disk models , the torque @xmath16 is the integrated value of the only stress tensor component ( @xmath17 ) that survives the condition of axisymmetry and geometric - thinness . from krolik ( 1999b )",

    "then , at @xmath27 , we engage an external torque ( possibly resulting from a magnetic connection to the plunging region or spinning event horizon ) that deposits angular momentum into a narrow annulus at @xmath28 . if the rate at which angular momentum is being deposited is @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 giving @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the heavyside step function . at this point",

    "suppose that the disk is in the untorqued steady state at @xmath26 .",
    "from eqn.[eqn : mod_diff ] , one can easily see that such a steady state is given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization constant and @xmath39 is the inner edge of the untorqued disk defined as the location where the `` viscous '' torques vanish .",
    "examination of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mod_diff ] shows that the time - dependent behavior of the torqued disk at times @xmath40 is given by the simple diffusion equation , @xmath41 with an initial condition set by integrating through the delta - function in time , @xmath42 .",
    "the appropriate boundary condition is @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "standard methods ( i.e. , separation of variables ) give the following solution : @xmath45\\exp\\left[-3k\\lambda^2t/4\\right]\\,d\\lambda.\\ ] ]    with this solution , we can compute the surface density of the disk at any given radius and time .",
    "armed with the surface density , we can then compute all other quantities of interest including the viscous dissipation rate per unit surface area of the disk : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "plots of the radial dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for various times are shown in figures  1[fig : newt2 ] . also shown",
    "is the time dependence of the total viscous dissipation obtained by integrating @xmath49 across the whole disk ( i.e. luminosity ) .",
    "we can see that the response of the disk to the onset of an external torque can be separated into two phases . in the first phase , the accretion flow is `` dammed '' at @xmath28 due to the inability of the accretion flow to transport the angular momentum deposited by the external torque .",
    "this leads to a build - up of mass ( i.e. , an increase in the surface density ) in the region @xmath50 .",
    "concurrently , matter in the region @xmath51 continues to accrete thereby partially draining away the surface density .",
    "the inevitable result is a growing discontinuity in the surface density at @xmath28 .",
    "the angular momentum transport associated with this discontinuity grows until mass can , once again , flow inwards across this radius .",
    "one then enters the second phase of evolution , whereby the surface density in the region @xmath51 is replenished back to its original level while the surface density discontinuity is maintained at approximately a constant level .",
    "eventually , one achieves the torqued steady - state solution ( e.g. , agol & krolik 2000 ) .",
    "the two sets of figures are for an external torque at @xmath52 and one closer to the inner edge at @xmath53 .",
    "note how , for a given injection rate of angular momentum , the effect on the disk structure is much more dramatic for smaller radius .",
    "since our disks are assumed to be radiatively - efficient , the instantaneous total luminosity of the accretion disk can be formally decomposed into two components , one due to the decrease in gravitational potential energy of the accreting gas , and a second due to the work done by the external torque , i.e. , @xmath54 as can be seen from fig .",
    "1(f ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : newt2](f ) , the luminosity dips before climbing up to a new elevated level that includes the work done by the external torque as well as the accretion energy .",
    "the temporary dip in luminosity is due to the damming of the accretion flow in the early evolution of the torquing event .",
    "[ one ]    [ fig : newt2 ]    now that we have explored a torquing event via the analytical solution of an extremely simplified accretion disk model , we move on to somewhat more realistic models . in the next section",
    ", we present a semi - analytic analysis of a geometrically - thin general relativistic accretion disk .",
    "relativity produces two complications to the analysis .",
    "firstly , the equations governing the structure of the accretion disk are rather more complex and drive us to use numerical rather than analytic techniques .",
    "secondly , the relationship between the emitted and observed fluxes becomes non - trivial , with gravitational light bending , relativistic aberration / beaming , and doppler / gravitational redshifting all becoming important .",
    "we shall deal with these issues in turn .",
    "the time - dependent equations describing the structure of a geometrically - thin accretion disk in the @xmath55 plane of a kerr spacetime are given in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath56 by eardley & lightman ( 1974 ) .",

    "thus , guided by the non - relativistic prescription , we set the vertically - integrated @xmath63 component of the stress tensor in the absence of an external torque to be @xmath66 where @xmath19 is the same effective viscosity that appeared in the non - relativistic expressions . noting that the total _",
    "torque _ is given by @xmath67 , we see that the appropriate relativistic diffusion equation describing a sporadically torqued disk ( i.e. , the counterpart to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : diffusion ] ) is @xmath68.\\ ] ] it is straightforward to verify that eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rel_diffusion ] reduces to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : basic_diffusion ] in the non - relativistic limit ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) .",
    "the complications introduced by the relativistic factors render this equation intractable to elementary solution methods .",
    "thus , we use a simple explicit scheme to numerically solve this diffusion equation following the treatment of press et al .",
    "figures  [ fig : relativistic ] and 4 show the temporal behavior of an accretion disk around schwarzschild ( @xmath70 ) and near maximal kerr ( @xmath6 ) black holes respectively . to facilitate comparison with the non - relativistic case",
    ", we have chosen the same viscosity law , @xmath71 ( i.e. @xmath19 scales with the radial boyer - lindquist coordinate and not the proper distance ) . as in the newtonian case ,",
    "this prescription does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "note that the behavior is similar to that found in the non - relativistic model .",
    "the two phases of evolution , the damming phase and the replenishing phase , are reproduced .",
    "the differences do not come from the dynamics but from the boundary conditions that are determined by the equilibrium conditions for circular geodesics .",
    "the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit for general relativistic potentials suggests placing the disk inner boundary at @xmath72 for schwarszchild spacetime and @xmath73 for the near - maximal kerr spacetime .",
    "relating the observed flux to the fundamental disk structure is substantially more complex in the relativistic case due to the complexities of general relativistic photon propagation . for a given value of the stress @xmath74",
    ", energy conservation gives that the total radiative flux from one side of the disk , measured in the locally orbiting frame , is ( novikov & thorne 1974 ) , @xmath75 suppose that the corresponding energy - integrated ( but angle - dependent ) intensity is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is measured from the normal to the disk plane ( in the locally orbiting frame of reference ) .",
    "following cunningham ( 1975 ) , an observer at infinity will see an integrated luminosity , @xmath78 where we have followed the notation of cunningham ( 1975 ) with the exception of @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath79 is the relativistic transfer function that results from ray - tracing null - geodesics through the kerr metric from the disk to the observer .",
    "we have used the code of r.speith ( speith , riffert & ruder 1995 ) to compute @xmath79 and hence perform this integral in order to examine how the observed luminosity changes through the torquing event .",
    "these calculations uncover a fundamental difference between the newtonian and relativistic cases . in the relativistic case ,",
    "the observed changes in luminosity are a function of the inclination angle of the observer due to the effects of light bending and relativistic beaming of the disk emission .",
    "figures  3f and 4f show the temporal behaviour of the observed flux ( normalized to the flux for the untorqued disk ) for various observing angles for our schwarzschild and near - extremal kerr cases , respectively .",
    "the final fractional increase in observed flux depends on the beaming pattern of the torque - energize region of the disk compared with that of the untorqued disk . for our schwarzschild case ( fig .",
    "3f ) , one can see that the final fractional increase in observed luminosity depends very weakly on the observing angle , implying that the untorqued disk and the torque - energerized region of the torqued disk have very similar beaming patterns .",
    "there is , however , a much more pronounced temporary decrease in observed flux at higher inclinations due to the temporary dimming of the ( more highly beamed ) inner regions of the disk . for our kerr case ,",
    "the final fractional increase in observed luminosity increases by almost a factor of two as one moves from almost face - on to almost edge - on disks , implying that the torque - energized region of the disk is significantly more beamed than the untorqued disk .",
    "a temporary decrease is only observed for the most edge - on cases , again due to a temporary dimming of the inner most regions of the disk .",
    "these features are all symptomatic of the fact that our black hole torques our accretion disk and deposits energy and angular momentum in the disk .",
    "this extra source of energy that is dumped into the disk and that tends to affect the disk outward of the external torque location constitutes the starting point for the analysis of section 4 where we attempt to explain the `` deep minimum state '' as the result of just such a sporadic torquing event .",
    "[ fig : relativistic ]    [ fig : relativistic ]",
    "in addition to exploring the general characteristics of sporadically - torqued disks , a central motivation for this study are the recent _ xmm - newton _ observations of the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "in particular , we would like to explore whether the enigmatic `` deep minimum state '' of this agn could correspond to a sporadic torquing event , possibly induced by the formation of a temporary magnetic connection between the inner accretion disk and either the plunging region of the disk or the rotating event horizon .",
    "there are two defining characteristics of the deep minimum state that must be reproduced by any successful model , the extremely broadened x - ray reflection features ( implying a very centrally concentrated x - ray irradiation pattern ) and the factor 23 drop in the observed x - ray continuum flux .",
    "a major uncertainty when relating disk models to x - ray observations is always the relation between the dissipation within the disk ( predicted by the models ) and the emission of the observed x - rays . if we suppose that a local disk - corona radiates a fixed fraction of the underlying dissipation into the x - ray band , the results of this paper quickly lead to a contradiction between the sporadically - torqued disk model and the observations . while the model does predict a temporary dip in observed luminosity for some observer inclinations ( that one might be tempted to identify with the continuum drop in the deep minimum ) , this dip is due to a dimming of the innermost regions of the accretion flow as a result of the damming of the mass flux .",
    "this is precisely the part of the flow that we wish to be enhanced in order to explain the simultaneous broadening of the x - ray reflection features .    with the ( standard )",
    "accretion disk corona framwork , the relation between the dissipation within the disk and the emission of the observed x - rays depends on the reprocessing of disk photons by the corona .",
    "we suggest this relation changes when the system departs from steady - state as the sporadic torque engages and will use this , in the next section , to model the deep minimum spectrum .",
    "the assumption that the x - ray emission from the disk corona locally tracks the dissipation in the underlying accretion disk is clearly an oversimplication .",
    "for example , krolik & hawley ( 2001 ) have used high - resolution pseudo - newtonian simulations to show that there is a rather extended transition ( occurring near but slightly outside of the radius of marginal stability ) from the pure mhd turbulent region characterizing the bulk of the disk to the more laminar flow present in the plunging region .",
    "since the heating of the corona is almost certainly due to reconnection and mhd wave heating from the underlying disk , the fraction of the dissipated energy transported to the corona will certainly change within this transition region , leading to a violation of the simple assumption employed in our toy models .",
    "a time - variable magnetic torque of the kind we envision in this paper might alter the mhd and thermodynamic properties of the gas and such a scenario might not be compatible with the one we describe in the thin - disk approximation .",
    "in other words , we can imagine that the external torque changes both the radiative efficiency of the gas as well as local mhd properties thereby invalidating the treatment of the magnetorotational instability as a local kinematic viscosity .",
    "this fact is most likely more important for thick disks where the degrees of freedom are greater .",
    "global disk simulations focusing on the formation and properties of the corona are required to address this issue and , hence , are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we do , however , note an important and mostly neglected physical effect that could substantially change the structure of a disk corona in a strongly torqued disk  compton cooling by flux emitted elsewhere in the accretion disk and , in particular , by `` returning radiation '' .",
    "consider a geometrically - thin accretion disk around a near - extremal kerr black hole , and suppose that it possesses a disk - hugging x - ray corona energized from the underlying disk .",
    "now suppose that the central regions of the disk are subjected to a significant torquing event .",
    "as shown above , the work done by the torque is rapidly radiated from the accretion disk in a very centrally concentrated manner .",
    "the torque - induced emission will be a combination of both thermal optical / uv radiation and hard x - ray emission produced by the corona associated with the torque - energized regions of the disk .",
    "now , some fraction of the torque - induced emission will strike the disk at larger radii  this will be particularly prevalent if the disk is flared or warped , but will occur even in flat disks due to relativistic light bending effects ( i.e. , returning radiation ; cunningham 1973 )",
    ". this extra irradiation will enhance the compton cooling of the corona at these larger radii . at the very least",
    ", the additional cooling will lead to a decrease in the compton amplification factor of the corona and a steepening of the coronal emission .",
    "one could envisage a situation , however , in which the compton cooling becomes so extreme that the corona completely collapses and local euv / x - ray emission ceases .",
    "some essential aspects of this scenario can be captured in a simple model based on energy conservation , following haardt & maraschi ( 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "consider the x - ray emitting corona above a unit - area patch of the disk at a radius @xmath15 .",
    "if a fraction @xmath80 of the energy dissipated in the underlying disk goes into heating the corona , the heating rate is @xmath81 by definition , the ( compton ) cooling rate of the corona is @xmath82 , where @xmath38 is the compton amplification factor and @xmath83 is the soft photon flux passing through the corona which will act as seed photons for the inverse compton scattering process that generates the x - rays . equating heating and cooling gives , @xmath84 we now determine @xmath83 by examining energy conservation of the colder disk underlying the corona .",
    "there are three contributions to that we must consider .",
    "firstly , the portion of the internal dissipation within the disk that does _ not _ get transported into the disk will become thermalized in the cold disk and contribute an amount @xmath85 to the disk heating .",
    "secondly , some fraction of the locally generated coronal flux @xmath86 will impinge on the disk and be reprocessed into soft flux .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 encapsulates possible anisotropies in the coronal flux and the albedo of the disk , but will typically be of the order of @xmath88 .",
    "finally , as noted above , irradiation of our coronal patch from other radii in the disk will contribute to the soft flux and hence the compton cooling .",
    "this will cool the corona due to both the direct action of the irradiating soft flux , and the reprocessing / thermalization of the soft and hard irradiating flux .",
    "suppose that the non - local irradiating flux is @xmath89 times the locally produced flux .",
    "the corresponding soft flux contributing to the compton cooling will be @xmath90 , where @xmath91 parameterizes the fraction of this non - local emission that ends up as soft flux .",
    "hence , the total soft flux at a particular location in the disk will be @xmath92 solving for @xmath38 , we get @xmath93    of course , within this simple model the total energy dissipated within the corona is a fixed fraction of the underlying dissipation irrespective of the ( cooling ) soft flux",
    ". however , the amplication factor is significantly reduced by returning radtion if @xmath94 $ ] which , for canonical values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , corresponds to @xmath97 . the resulting coronal spectrum from the affected regions of the disk",
    "would be expected to steepen significantly , possibly placing a large fraction of the emission into the unobservable euv band .    for a flat disk at large radii subjected to returning radiation",
    ", we have @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the enhancement in the efficiency of the disk due to the inner torque and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are dimensionless functions of the black hole spin parameter given by the fitting formulae of agol & krolik ( 2001 ) . for a near - extremal kerr black hole ( @xmath6 )",
    ", we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we can see that even in the absence of disk flaring or warping , returning radiation alone could significantly depress coronal x - ray activity at large radii if @xmath104}{\\xi_2}-0.2.\\ ] ] thus , although there is some dependence on the properties ( e.g. , isotropy and patchiness ) of the corona and the ability of the disk to reprocess and thermalize any incoming flux , the corona will be depressed if the disk is in a `` spin - dominated '' state ( @xmath105 ) , i.e. , a state in which the disk is shining via the release of black hole spin energy rather than gravitational potential energy .",
    "let us now return to mcg6 - 30 - 15 and the sporadic external torque model for its deep minimum state .",
    "we suppose that the normal state of this system is that of a standard untorqued accretion disk that might well be described by the standard accretion models of novikov & thorne ( 1974 ) and page & thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "we then suppose that some shift in magnetic configuration caused the accretion disk to become magnetically torqued by either the plunging region or the rotating black hole itself .",
    "we hypothesize that this event signals the onset of a deep minimum state .    on timescales shorter than the viscous timescale of the inner disk ( @xmath106 ) , we expect this torquing event to lead to a damming of the accretion flow and a true dimming of the disk interior to the location where the connection has occurred .",
    "however , on longer timescales , the disk will tend to the new torqued steady - state ( provided the torque is sufficiently long - lived ) .",
    "if the magnetic torquing occurs in the very centralmost regions of the disk ( which is likely in all of the scenarios that we are envisaging ) , the torqued steady - state will possess a much more centrally concentrated dissipation pattern .",
    "as described above , some fraction of this central flux will strike the disk further out ( the returning radiation phenomenon ) and possibly lead to a compton suppression of the x - ray emitting corona there .",
    "only the central portions of the x - ray emitting corona which are being vigorously energized will contributed significantly to the observed x - ray flux .",
    "it is simple to see that the _ overall x - ray luminosity _ escaping the system is unlikely to drop , and will probably rise , within this scenario  the non - local cooling is only important for @xmath107 , in which case the part of the disk directly energized by the torque will produce coronal luminosity in excess of @xmath108 . even accounting for the fact that half of this may strike the disk and be reprocessed into soft flux , the _ overall _ x - ray luminosity of the torqued disk will inevitably exceed that of the untorqued disk ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "however , the highly centrally concentrated nature of the torqued emission coupled with the suppression of the x - ray emission at larger radii means that this x - ray luminosity is highly beamed into the plane of the disk ( see fig .",
    "10 of dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the _ observed x - ray flux _ for an observer with an inclination of 30@xmath110 can readily drop . in other words",
    ", the observed coronal activity is supressed by cooling from a powerful photon source that goes largely unobserved due to beaming effects .",
    "both non - relativistic and fully - relativistic mhd simulations of black hole accretion suggest the ubiquity of weak torques across the radius of marginal stability ( hawley & krolik 2000 , 2001 ; de  villers , hawley & krolik 2003 ; gammie , shapiro & mckinney 2004 ) .",
    "however , it is still far from clear whether these torques can ever achieve the strength required to allow a decline of the overall mass - energy of the black hole , due to spin - down of the hole , a requirement for the kind of spin - dominated accretion disks that we have been discussing within the context of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "significantly more simulation work is needed to address this question .",
    "if one makes the assumption that such strongly torqued disks are possible , they provide a plausible and theoretically - attractive explanation for the extremely broadened x - ray reflection features seen in the deep minimum state of mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al . 2001 ;",
    "reynolds et al . 2004 ) as well as the galactic black hole binary xtej1650500 ( miller et al . 2002 ) . given this hypothesis",
    ", we can ask whether the onset of the deep minimum state corresponds to the occurrence of a strong torquing event .",
    "we address this question through analytic and semi - analytic time - dependent toy models of torqued accretion . using these models",
    ", we have shown that the simple model of a sporadically - torqued disk _ fails _ to explain the phenomenology of the deep minimum state transition",
    ". however , it would be premature to dismiss torqued - disk models on the basis of this failure .",
    "in particular , the real culprit may be the assumption that the local x - ray emission is a fixed fraction of the dissipation in the underlying disk .",
    "we discuss a particular scenario in which all but the innermost x - ray emitting corona is quenched by returning radiation when the torque is engaged .",
    "other possibilities include changes in the structure of the mhd turbulence as a result of the strong torquing event that , in turn , could readily change the fraction of the dissipated energy that is transported into the corona .",
    "an alternative paradigm is the gravitational light - bending model of fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) and miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) . here",
    ", the primary x - ray source is located on the black hole spin axis . a transition into the deep minimum state corresponds to a migration of the x - ray source down to 23@xmath111 , with the light bending producing both an enhancement in the central illumination of the accretion disk and a dimming of the observed x - ray continuum flux .",
    "while the physical nature of the axial x - ray source remains unclear , it is an appealing aspect of this model that it reproduces the long - term temporal behavior of the iron line strength ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "as is often the case , it is uncertainty in the geometry of the primary x - ray source that prevents us from distinguishing between the torqued - disk and light - bending models .",
    "the most promising observational approach is to search for a reverberation delay between short timescale flickering in the x - ray continuum and the corresponding response in the x - ray reflection signatures .",
    "if measurements of this time - delay demonstrate that the x - ray source in the deep minimum is indeed 23@xmath111 ( corresponding to @xmath112 light seconds ) above the central disk plane , strong light - bending must occur and the need for a torqued disk is removed .",
    "measurements of this time - delay will constrain the x - ray source geometry and allow the degeneracy between these two models to be resolved .",

    "<S> if the deep minimum state of mcg6 - 30 - 15 is indeed due to a sporadic torquing event , we show that the fraction of the dissipated energy going into x - rays must be smaller in the torqued state . </S>",
