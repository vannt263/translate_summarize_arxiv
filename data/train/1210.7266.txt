    "clarifying our understanding of @xmath0 physics is an increasingly important undertaking in the hunt for beyond the standard model ( bsm ) physics .",
    "the most recent round of experimental results from babar and the lhc have imposed strict bounds on possible bsm contributions to rare @xmath0 decays @xcite , whilst continued experimental and theoretical progress has lead to more exacting tests of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix unitarity @xcite .",
    "flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are forbidden at tree - level in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "such processes can only proceed through loop contributions , which are sensitive to much higher energy scales than the @xmath1 quark mass .",
    "fcnc decays therefore serve as a probe for bsm physics and can tightly constrain the nature and size of bsm interactions .",
    "in particular , precise measurements of the branching fractions of the rare @xmath2 decays offer two of the most promising avenues for the detection of bsm effects .",
    "these decays are strongly sensitive to the existence of bsm particles in a variety of bsm scenarios ( see , for example , the discussion and references in @xcite ) .",
    "semileptonic fcnc processes , such as @xmath3 , may provide bounds on classes of bsm physics that are not ruled out by purely leptonic modes @xcite .    taking a different tack",
    ", the @xmath0 sector also provides the opportunity for detecting bsm physics through precision tests of the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "this matrix , which is unitary in the standard model , relates the mass and weak - interaction eigenstates of down - type quarks and incorporates all the flavor - changing and cp - violating couplings in the standard model . a wide array of channels probe the ckm matrix , such as the semileptonic decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and neutral @xmath0 mixing .",
    "combining independent determinations of each ckm parameter over - constrains the elements of the ckm matrix and discrepancies or deviations from unitarity may indicate the breakdown of the ckm framework .",
    "currently a number of tensions at the @xmath6 level in unitarity fits hint at the exciting possibility of bsm physics @xcite .",
    "whether the hunt for bsm physics involves fcnc processes or ckm unitarity tests , one thing is clear : lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is an indispensable tool in the search .",
    "precision tests of the standard model require both precise experimental and theoretical inputs .",
    "quarks are confined to color - singlet states and the physics of the weak interactions underlying fcnc decays and ckm - probing processes must be teased out from the dominant nonperturbative dynamics of the strong force .",
    "lattice qcd is one of the most important tools presently available for precisely determining nonperturbative effects , but until recently has , in many cases , been playing catch - up with experimental precision . over the last five years , however , the era of precision lattice qcd has dawned , with many results now at the few percent level @xcite . with the convergence of experimental and theoretical precision , and with",
    "growing experimental datasets and advancing lattice computations , tests of the standard model have become ever more exacting .",
    "what is less clear , perhaps , is how lattice perturbation theory fits into the march toward high precision tests of the standard model .",
    "what is lattice perturbation theory ? and what exactly is the role of lattice perturbation theory in the hunt for bsm physics ?",
    "this review will answer these questions .",
    "viewed from the outside , lattice qcd calculations are often seen as black boxes , simply nonperturbative number - crunchers that spit out _ ab initio _ predictions .",
    "closer inspection reveals , not surprisingly , that this is not the whole story .",
    "i will attempt to lift the lid on heavy quark lattice qcd calculations  at least just a little  by examining the role of lattice perturbation theory in lattice b physics .",
    "i will frame this discussion in two ways : the first is the use of lattice perturbation theory in different formulations of heavy quarks on the lattice .",
    "viewed through this lens , we see that lattice perturbation theory is a tool that is used , to varying degrees , by all the major lattice collaborations working on @xmath0 physics .",
    "the second is the role of lattice perturbation theory in the calculation of specific physical processes , particularly key applications in the search for bsm physics .",
    "i focus on precision @xmath0 physics ; to this end i discuss not only processes currently in the headlights of bsm physics hunters , but also precision @xmath0 spectroscopy , which has proved to be a trustworthy testing ground for lattice",
    "qcd and provides firm evidence that lattice qcd is indeed becoming more precise and reliable .",
    "for brevity i concentrate on the impact of lattice perturbation theory in lattice @xmath0 physics , rather than discussing specific details of individual calculations .",
    "i start by motivating lattice perturbation theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : lpt ] and then briefly review recent methods for automating lattice perturbation theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : autlpt ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lptlimit ] i examine the ways in which lattice perturbation theory is used in various heavy quark formulations on the lattice .",
    "i briefly discuss relativistic formulations for heavy quarks on the lattice , but focus on the historically more prevalent effective field theory approach and use this discussion to limn the limits of lattice perturbation theory . in the second half of the review",
    "i highlight some applications of lattice perturbation theory to specific physical processes at the forefront of bsm searches and conclude with a short summary in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "lattice qcd is the preeminent approach for _ ab initio _ calculations of qcd processes and is conspicuously a tool for nonperturbative physics computations . in this view ,",
    "the phrase `` lattice perturbation theory '' has the air of a contradiction  the perturbation theory of nonperturbative physics .",
    "but the phrase is slightly misleading : lattice perturbation theory is better viewed as `` perturbation theory for lattice actions '' .",
    "this move is not just cosmetic ; the latter terminology is not only less outwardly troubling , but also generally more accurate and specific in scope .",
    "unfortunately the new nomenclature is cumbersome ; throughout this review i will continue to simply refer to lattice perturbation theory ( henceforth `` lpt '' ) , with the understanding that what is really at the heart of the discussion is `` perturbation theory for lattice actions '' .",
    "a glance at the lpt literature reveals a range of applications within lattice qcd : calculating the renormalization parameters of bare lattice actions ; matching regularization schemes and extracting continuum results from lattice data ; and improving lattice actions .",
    "these applications , however , are inter - related and can be broadly categorized as accounting for the physics of energy scales excluded by the lattice cutoff . in other words , each of these applications falls under the banner of renormalization .",
    "understanding these motivations for using lpt  that is , as a tool for renormalization  is also the key to understanding the justification for using lattice perturbation theory , laid out in @xcite .",
    "the lattice serves as an ultraviolet regulator discretizing spacetime and excluding all momenta greater than @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "as we would in any other regularization scheme , we must calculate the renormalization parameters of the regularized theory to correctly account for high energy effects . in this case",
    "the excluded scales are those above the lattice cutoff , which corresponds to approximately 5 gev for current lattice spacings . at these energy scales ,",
    "the coupling constant is relatively small , @xmath9 , and perturbative approximations ( and therefore lpt ) are likely to be valid .",
    "lpt thus provides the connection between the low and high energy regimes of qcd .",
    "moreover , this connection has been tested and validated in a wide range of qcd processes by comparing higher order perturbative calculations with nonperturbative computations in the weak coupling regime @xcite .",
    "there is , however , some subtlety to this story : we must choose our coupling constant carefully to ensure the perturbative series is well - behaved .",
    "early lpt calculations were plagued by slow convergence and inconsistent results @xcite .",
    "these issues were the product of a poor choice of expansion parameter : the bare lattice coupling .",
    "we can greatly improve the convergence of our perturbative series by introducing an improved coupling constant , often defined in the `` v - scheme '' @xcite , expressed at an appropriately chosen scale , the `` blm scale '' @xcite . in some cases",
    ", lpt is simply insufficient and nonperturbative renormalization is required ( see section [ sec : hqet ] for an example ) .    before turning to look at some of the uses of lpt in different lattice formulations",
    ", i will examine in a little more detail both renormalization and improvement in the context of lpt .",
    "[ [ renormalization - and - matching - calculations ] ] renormalization and matching calculations + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in general one has two choices for calculating renormalization parameters , matching parameters or improvement coefficients for lattice actions : nonperturbative tuning or perturbative calculation .",
    "there are a variety of nonperturbative tuning methods .",
    "a full review is beyond the scope of this report , but a partial list includes step - scaling methods , which may be applied to the schrdinger functional @xcite , off - shell green functions ( the `` rome - southampton method'')@xcite or physical quantities@xcite ; imposing ward identities or chiral symmetry relations @xcite ; and fixing to physical quantities , such as meson masses , or relations , such as relativistic dispersion relations @xcite .    although these approaches differ considerably in practice , they share two particular advantages .",
    "all nonperturbative methods enable the replacement of perturbative truncation errors , which can be hard to quantify , with statistical and systematic errors , which can usually be determined reliably . in general , with intensified computational effort , these uncertainties can be systematically reduced .",
    "secondly , a fully nonperturbative approach is the only truly _ ab initio _",
    "method for qcd calculations .",
    "nonperturbative methods share a number of disadvantages as well : step - scaling and iterative methods incur a greatly increased computational expense , whilst matching to physical quantities results in a loss of predictive power .",
    "lpt is an alternative to nonperturbative tuning . in this approach one",
    "calculates the renormalization constants or matching parameters perturbatively , carrying out the calculation in a spirit broadly similar to the standard perturbative calculations of continuum qcd .",
    "lpt is computationally much cheaper than nonperturbative tuning and there is no loss of predictive power .",
    "there are disadvantages , too , of course .",
    "most notably lpt introduces perturbative truncation errors .",
    "as lattice calculations become more precise , the concomitant perturbative error often become the largest source of uncertainty in the result , which will ultimately necessitate multi - loop calculations will eventually be necessary .",
    "this is no mean feat : lpt is usually more involved than the corresponding calculations in continuum qcd .",
    "the relatively recent advent of sophisticated automated perturbation routines for lattice actions , however , means that multi - loop calculations for improved actions have been carried out @xcite . despite the complications ,",
    "the computational cost of such calculations is invariably lower than that for nonperturbative tuning , ensuring lpt is an attractive alternative to nonperturbative renormalization .",
    "[ [ improvement ] ] improvement + + + + + + + + + + +    precise lattice qcd computations generally require lattices with two properties : small lattice spacings to reduce discretization errors and large lattice volumes to remove finite size effects .",
    "unfortunately lattice qcd calculations tend to be rather computationally expensive . and",
    "as the lattice spacing decreases and the lattice size increases , they grow ever more expensive .",
    "thankfully for precision @xmath0 physics there is an alternative to simply using ever finer lattice spacings .",
    "lattice actions can instead be `` improved '' to eliminate sources of error .",
    "the most common approach to improvement is the symanzik improvement programme @xcite , in which scaling violations are systematically removed by adding irrelevant operators to the lattice action , organized by mass dimension .",
    "this approach is frequently significantly cheaper than simulating at smaller lattice spacings .    determining the coefficients of the new terms in the improved action",
    "can usually be carried out quite simply at tree - level , but for precision studies , this is insufficient . by construction lattice actions",
    "exhibit the same long - range physics as continuum qcd , but their short - range behaviour is distorted by the lattice cutoff .",
    "radiative corrections to the new operators in the action renormalize the coefficients away from their tree - level values and this can lead to new sources of uncertainty in lattice predictions . by matching onshell quantities on the lattice and in the continuum , the resultant discrepancies can be removed order - by - order in perturbation theory .",
    "there is naturally a price to be paid for adding extra terms to the action ( radiatively improved or otherwise ) .",
    "the extra operators considerably complicate the feynman rules for the improved actions .",
    "highly improved actions , such as the hisq and nrqcd actions that i discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : lptlimit ] , generate feynman rules that can not feasibly be manipulated by hand .",
    "furthermore , the lack of lorentz symmetry complicates the evaluation of feynman integrals , which are no longer amenable to feynman parameter transformations or the other tricks of the continuum trade and must be handled numerically . to cope with",
    "these complications lpt has been automated .",
    "in recent years a number of automated lattice perturbation theory algorithms have been developed , many following the pioneering work of lscher and weisz@xcite .",
    "an early variant of the lscher - weisz ( lw ) algorithm was deployed in @xcite , but currently the most widely used descendant of the lw algorithm is implemented in the ` hippy `  @xmath10/`hpsrc `  software packages @xcite .",
    "more recently , the lw algorithm was adapted for gauge actions in the schrdinger functional scheme @xcite .",
    "a new software package , called ` pastor `  , has extended this work to include wilson - type relativistic quarks and hqet heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "initial calculations with ` pastor `  are underway @xcite . finally , following an altogether different approach , a computer algebra system has been constructed and optimized for lpt @xcite .",
    "although the use of this software has so far been restricted to a calculation using the relativistic heavy quark action in the columbia formulation @xcite , in principle the algorithm can be extended to any lattice quark action .",
    "the ` hippy `  @xmath10/`hpsrc `  software packages have now been used in a variety of perturbative calculations , for example in @xcite , and extensively tested against previous results . evaluating feynman integrals",
    "is a two stage process with the ` hippy `  @xmath10/`hpsrc `  routines : one first generates the feynman rules with ` hippy ` ,  a set of ` python `  routines that encode the feynman rules in `` vertex files '' .",
    "these vertex files are then read by the ` hpsrc `  ` fortran `  modules , which evaluate the corresponding integrals numerically via the ` vegas `  algorithm @xcite or exact mode summation over a finite lattice .",
    "any derivatives required in the calculation are implemented analytically using the derived ` taylor ` type , defined as part of the ` fortran `  ` taylur `  package @xcite .",
    "both ` hippy `  and ` hpsrc `  implement parallel processing using mpi ( message passing interface ) .",
    "the schrdinger functional scheme has been widely used over the last thirty years ( see the sec .  [",
    "sec : hqet ] for references ) .",
    "the advent of lpt for the schrdinger functional scheme is , however , much more recent .",
    "there are two reasons for this : the first is the additional complexity introduced by the schrdinger functional formalism and the second is that lpt has very limited application to hqet computations , as i discuss in more detail in the next section .",
    "lpt is nevertheless useful , because perturbative calculations can serve as a starting point for more precise nonperturbative methods .",
    "these nonperturbative methods are computationally expensive and there are a large number of renormalization parameters in the schrdinger functional scheme , many of which have only a small relative effect on the final result .",
    "perturbative investigations can guide where computational resources should be focussed to most improve the precision of lattice calculations .",
    "there are three complications that must be handled by automated routines for the schrdinger functional scheme .",
    "firstly , translational invariance , which is assumed in the ` hippy `  @xmath10/`hpsrc `  algorithm , is broken in the time direction .",
    "secondly , we must account for an induced abelian color background gauge field/`hpsrc `  packages have been extended to use background field gauge @xcite , but this implementation is not sufficient for the schrdinger functional scheme . ] .",
    "thirdly , at a given order in the coupling constant , there are extra diagrams generated by the boundary conditions of the schrdinger functional scheme that are not present in other lattice formulations .",
    "the ` pastor `  software package , written specifically to deal with these difficulties , is based on ` c++ ` routines that generate vertices and a ` python `  frontend wrapper that allows the user to specify the lattice actions in symbolic form in ` c++ ` .",
    "an ` xml ` input file specifies the desired observable in the schrdinger functional scheme , which the ` python `  frontend routine parses to generate all the relevant diagrams of order @xmath11 .",
    "these diagrams are then evaluated with a ` c++ ` program generated by the ` python `  wrapper @xcite .",
    "the most recent automated lpt framework , presented in @xcite , is based on a new ` c++ ` computer algebra library optimized for lattice perturbation theory .",
    "lattice actions are defined by ` c++ ` classes that allow the user to specify the action in text form .",
    "these classes extract the vertices , then further ` c++ ` classes perform wick contractions and convert the algebraic representation of the integrand into efficient ` c++ ` code that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "this framework also contains routines that can perform analytic differentiation with respect to the external momenta and undertake continuum calculations in dimensional regularization using the passarino - veltman reduction @xcite .",
    "the computational expense of lattice qcd has been a distinct problem for @xmath1 quarks , which are heavy and therefore `` fall through '' lattices that are too coarse to accurately resolve the compton wavelength of the @xmath1 quark .",
    "putting this more precisely : it is not currently computationally feasible to use lattices large enough and fine enough to simultaneously satisfy @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the mass of the lightest propagating particle in the theory ; @xmath15 is the side length of the lattice ; and @xmath16 is the mass of the @xmath1 quark .",
    "heavy - light systems , which feature heavily in bsm searches in the @xmath0 sector , represent the worst of all computational worlds ; they are characterized by both the mass of the light quark and the @xmath1 quark  scales separated by several orders of magnitude .",
    "lattice qcd has traditionally dealt with this problem using the technology of effective field theories . despite the considerable advances in computing infrastructure and simulation algorithms over the last thirty years , even state - of - the - art lattice computations require extrapolations up to the @xmath1 quark mass @xcite and effective field theories continue to play an important part in lattice simulations .",
    "historically , the application of effective field theoretic techniques to lattice qcd has elucidated the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative physics and has consequently helped advance the understanding of conceptual issues such as the operator product expansion and the role of renormalons .",
    "i will examine effective theories for heavy quarks more closely to highlight some of the limitations of lpt ,    there are two widely used approaches to heavy quarks on the lattice : nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) and heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "both take advantage of the large mass of the @xmath1 quark relative to other scales in qcd physics and both have the same infinite mass , or stationary quark , limit .",
    "there are , however , important differences . here",
    "i only briefly outline some of the important considerations for lpt for both lattice nrqcd and hqet . for a more complete pedagogical introduction to continuum nrqcd ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "reviews of hqet in the continuum appear in @xcite and in the textbooks @xcite , whilst lattice hqet is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "heavy quark bound states are typified by the small relative velocity of their constituent quarks . in heavy @xmath17 states , such as the @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons ,",
    "this relative velocity is approximately @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , @xmath21 induces three well - separated energy scales : the mass , @xmath22 ; the momentum , @xmath23 ; and the kinetic energy @xmath24 .",
    "nrqcd is also suitable for heavy - light systems , such as the @xmath0 and @xmath25 mesons , in which case the expansion parameter is @xmath26 and the power counting is that of hqet , but for simplicity i restrict my discussion to heavy - heavy systems .    to construct the nrqcd action we use the foldy - wouthuysen - tani transformation @xcite to decouple the quark and antiquark fields and",
    "undertake a nonrelativistic expansion .",
    "the result is an effective theory with nonrelativistic , low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "at lowest order , the continuum nrqcd action is just the nonrelativistic schrdinger action .    following the symanzik improvement scheme , we can then systematically include interactions and improve the nrqcd action to a given order in @xmath21 and @xmath26 by adding irrelevant higher order operators .",
    "finally , armed with an appropriately improved continuum nrqcd action , we then discretize it for lattice computations .",
    "we must choose the coefficients of the higher order operators to ensure the effective lattice theory replicates the correct behaviour for physical observables .",
    "as i discussed in the previous section , calculating the radiative corrections to the improvement coefficients is the role of lpt .",
    "one property of lattice nrqcd is a particular challenge : lattice nrqcd is a nonrenormalizable effective theory with no continuum limit .",
    "we can not take the limit of vanishing bare lattice mass , @xmath27 .",
    "even at leading order in the foldy - wouthuysen - tani transformation , the @xmath28 corrections are present in the heavy quark propagator .",
    "interaction and improvement terms in the nrqcd action are higher order in @xmath28 and consequently there are an infinite number of divergences that can not be absorbed into the renormalization parameters .    from a perturbative standpoint",
    ", this means the series that define the radiative corrections to the higher order operators in the action become ill - defined at small masses .",
    "lpt  and indeed nrqcd  fails in the region @xmath29 .",
    "this has been explicitly demonstrated for the case of the chromomagnetic correction to nrqcd by studying the mass dependence for a range of masses around @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we can safely use lpt to improve lattice nrqcd , provided we remain in the region for which @xmath31 .",
    "this ensures that nonperturbative computations using lattice nrqcd converge with those obtained from continuum qcd .",
    "although we can not take the continuum limit of lattice nrqcd  it does not exist  we can nevertheless extract continuum results from lattice nrqcd calculations . by carrying out computations at different values of the lattice spacing within the region of validity of nrqcd , _",
    "i.e. _  at different values of @xmath32 for @xmath33 , we may parameterize the lattice spacing dependence of our results and quote uncertainties appropriately . with sufficient improvement",
    ", we can reduce the lattice spacing dependence to , for example @xmath34 or higher , and obtain correspondingly precise results , often at the few percent level . without lpt , such precise nonperturbative results for many @xmath0 physics parameters would be a distant hope for the future .",
    "although hqet bears many similarities to nrqcd , the approach is both conceptually and practically distinct .",
    "the first conceptual difference is that , unlike nrqcd , hqet is an effective theory for singularly heavy hadrons ; mesons such as the @xmath19 or @xmath18 are off limits .",
    "the second crucial distinction is that hqet is believed to be renormalizable at leading order , _",
    "i.e. _  in the infinite heavy quark mass , or `` static '' , limit .",
    "the third contrast is that , even in the static limit , the renormalization and matching parameters of lattice hqet must be calculated nonperturbatively for precise @xmath0 physics results @xcite .",
    "lpt will not do .",
    "hqet is motivated by the intuition that singularly heavy hadrons are analogous to a hydrogen atom , with the @xmath1 quark playing the part of the proton and the light quark the electron .",
    "constructing hqet follows the same effective field theory approach to building nrqcd : we identify the relevant degrees of freedom , decouple the high and low energy modes via the fold - wouthuysen - tani transformation and include all terms consistent with the desired symmetries at a given order in the expansion .",
    "we start by building an effective field theory that describes the light degrees of freedom interacting with a static color source , the heavy quark .",
    "then , rather than including higher order operators directly in the hqet lagrangian , we expand the non - leading terms in the path integral weight factor , @xmath35 , so that the non - leading contributions appear as insertions in correlation functions .",
    "more explicitly , we write @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\ = { } & \\exp\\bigg[-a^4\\sum_x{\\cal l}^{\\text{static}}_{\\text{hqet}}(x)\\bigg]\\left(1-a^4\\sum_x{\\cal l}^{(1)}_{\\text{hqet}}(x)\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the leading order hqet lagrangian and @xmath38 contains higher order terms .",
    "this approach ensures that hqet remains renormalizable and the continuum limit of hqet correlation functions exists , provided all local operators at a given order in @xmath28 are included .",
    "the parameters of the effective theory are fixed at tree - level by the fwt transformation , but beyond tree - level these must be found by matching to a @xmath39 expansion of continuum qcd .",
    "perturbative matching is insufficient for precision @xmath0 physics .",
    "continuum hqet matching factors have been perturbatively studied in , for example , @xcite , where it was demonstrated that even at three - loops the convergence of the perturbative series is very slow .",
    "the matching coefficients are scale dependent , and their magnitude can be reduced by lowering the scale , but this does not help : at the scale at which the perturbative series converges quickly the coupling constant itself is rather large .",
    "there seems to be no escaping the conclusion that for reliable results at the precision of a few percent , nonperturbative matching is necessary @xcite .    beyond",
    "leading order , matrix elements of higher dimensional operators mix and their coefficients must be fine tuned .",
    "these operators diverge with inverse powers of the lattice spacing and attempting to remove these power divergences via perturbative matching introduces ambiguities associated with so - called `` renormalons '' .",
    "a full study of renormalons and their role in hqet would take us too far from our central topic ; for in - depth reviews with applications to @xmath0 physics and hqet , see for example , @xcite . in essence renormalons arise because perturbative qcd is an asymptotic approximation to qcd that fails to capture nonperturbative behavior .",
    "a common example is the pole mass , which is a long distance quantity that can be rigorously defined order - by - order in perturbation theory as the pole of the renormalized quark propagator , but is subject to inescapable renormalon ambiguities of @xmath40 when nonperturbative effects are included @xcite .    for our purposes ,",
    "though , the central point is that renormalization parameters of hqet must be calculated nonperturbatively .",
    "this is a non - trivial task to implement for precision @xmath0 physics , because one must ensure firstly that the hqet expansion is sufficiently accurate and secondly that the numerical precision is adequate .",
    "on top of this , the lattice simulations must be undertaken with physical volumes large enough to avoid significant finite volume corrections .",
    "currently the alpha collaboration is carrying out a programme of precision @xmath0 physics using hqet for the @xmath1 quark @xcite and implementing nonperturbative renormalization using the schrdinger functional scheme and a step - scaling method @xcite .",
    "all this does not mean , however , that lpt has no role to play in hqet computations .",
    "in fact , the alpha collaboration has recently developed automated lpt routines for the schrdinger functional scheme @xcite to serve as an exploratory guide to focus computational effort most efficiently in nonperturbative determinations .",
    "relativistic heavy quark actions combine aspects of effective theories and fully relativistic treatments and hence serve as a suitable framework for both light and heavy quarks @xcite . the basic idea of the relativistic heavy quark formalism is to extend the symanzik effective theory approach , on which nrqcd and hqet are based , to include interactions from both the small @xmath41 and large @xmath42 limits . as we take the limit of vanishing bare mass , @xmath43 , the relativistic heavy quark action reduces to the @xmath44-improved clover action @xcite .",
    "conversely , in the large bare mass limit , when @xmath45 , the action breaks the time - space axis interchange symmetry and can be interpreted nonrelativistically , with a universal static limit .",
    "both the fermilab lattice / milc collaboration and the rbc / ukqcd collaboration , currently employ relativistic heavy quarks for precision @xmath0 physics @xcite .",
    "these collaborations approaches to the relativistic heavy quark formalism differ primarily in the methods they use to tune their actions .",
    "the rbc / ukqcd method uses three physical conditions to tune their parameters , matching to the spin - averaged @xmath25 mass and hyperfine splitting and ensuring the continuum dispersion relation holds for the @xmath25 meson .",
    "this tuning process is nonperturbative , but there is nonetheless a role for lpt .",
    "perturbative calculations of the three tuning parameters at one - loop have been carried out to provide a consistency check for the nonperturbative tuning process @xcite . ultimately lpt will be used for parameters for which nonperturbative tuning is not available .    in the fermilab approach ,",
    "two of the parameters are fixed and the third tuned nonperturbatively , using the spin - averaged @xmath25 mass @xcite .",
    "lpt played its part in the original construction of the fermilab action @xcite , and remains an important component for matching lattice matrix elements to their continuum counterparts . for decays such as",
    "the semileptonic @xmath46 and @xmath47 decays , the fermilab lattice / milc collaboration use a mixed approach to matching .",
    "the bulk of the matching is carried out nonperturbatively , leaving a factor close to unity that can be calculated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "for other processes , such as neutral @xmath0 mixing , however , the fermilab lattice / milc collaboration uses a purely perturbative matching procedure @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that lpt played a critical role in the formulation of the relativistic heavy quark action used by the tsukuba group @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", there is an extra parameter in the action that can not be nonperturbatively determined @xcite .",
    "two lattice collaborations have recently begun to implement a programme of precision @xmath0 physics using purely relativistic actions : the hpqcd collaboration @xcite and the etm collaboration @xcite .",
    "these collaborations use different relativistic actions in their computations , but both presently require extrapolations up to the physical @xmath1 quark mass .",
    "the hpqcd collaboration uses the highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action @xcite , whilst the etm collaboration employs a twisted mass variant of the wilson action .",
    "the hisq action exhibits exact chiral symmetry in the massless limit and therefore the heavy - light axial - vector and vector currents are absolutely normalized and do not require operator matching .",
    "the role of lpt in hisq calculations is consequently somewhat reduced , but not completely absent .",
    "one loop calculations were required in the construction of the hisq action .",
    "furthremore , renormalization parameters for the tensor current and four quark operators are not absolutely normalized and therefore require matching to their continuum counterparts .",
    "the etm collaboration uses nonperturbative renormalization for the quark bilinear operators used in @xmath0 physics applications @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lpt is used to parameterize the discretization errors associated in the scale dependence of the nonperturbative renormalization factors in the ri - mom scheme @xcite . subtracting the one - loop perturbative behaviour significantly",
    "improves the size of discretization errors in the renormalization constants @xcite .",
    "the part that lpt plays here may be restricted , but it has still been important in improving the precision of twisted mass computations .    as above discussion makes clear , even as nonperturbative simulations move closer to the ideal of true _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of qcd processes , lpt retains a vital role in extracting precise results . to clarify this role further",
    ", i now turn to the application of lpt in specific @xmath0 physics processes .",
    "a handful of key @xmath0 processes have become the loci of considerable experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "effort has naturally focused on those processes that have , or are likely to soon have , small experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "i will concentrate on only those channels that lie at the heart of the searches for bsm physics and ckm matrix unitarity violation and restrict my discussion to exclusive channels .",
    "inclusive processes , whilst playing a vital role in bsm searches and contraining ckm matrix unitarity , fall outside the scope of this short review .",
    "i summarize the processes in which lpt has been an important ingredient in table [ tab : processes ] .",
    "i break the table into three sections : in the top third i tabulate the key processes currently in the headlights of the flavor physics community . in the second third i present other processes for which lpt has been necessary for precise nonperturbative results .",
    "these processes have yet to achieve the experimental or theoretical importance of the processes listed in the first third of the table ( usually because of larger experimental or theoretical uncertainties ) , but are nevertheless playing an increasingly important role in flavor physics in the heavy quark sector . in the final third",
    ", i present some more speculative approaches to uncovering new physics .",
    "such processes are either poorly understood theoretically or are yet to be observed experimentally .",
    "naturally this hierarchy is largely a difference of degree rather than difference in kind , but highlights the crucial processes at the center of current bsm searches . within table [ tab :",
    "processes ] i distinguish between processes that determine ckm matrix elements , and thereby constrain ckm matrix unitarity , and rare decays that offer hope for detection of bsm loop effects .",
    "i represent this distinction in the second column . in the third column",
    "i give the quantity determined by lattice qcd that characterizes the nonperturbative physics of the process . in column four",
    "i list the relevant renormalization parameters calculated using lpt .",
    "i use the shorthand @xmath48 to represent heavy - light currents , @xmath49 for heavy - heavy currents and @xmath50 to indicate four - fermion interactions .",
    "matrix elements of quark currents are the starting point for any lattice computation of nonperturbative qcd contributions to weak interaction processes .",
    "understanding quark current renormalization is consequently a critical component of precise lattice qcd predictions .",
    "the vector current mediates weak interactions between states of the same parity , such as the semileptonic decay @xmath51 , which is parameterized by @xmath52 + f_0(q^2)\\frac{m_b^2-m_\\pi^2}{q^2}q^\\mu,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the `` form factors '' . in the limit @xmath55 , a good approximation for electron and muon neutrinos",
    ", the decay rate reduces to @xmath56 this channel lies at the center of one of the main tensions in analyses of ckm matrix unitarity : currently , the values of @xmath57 from inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays exhibit a @xmath58 disagreement @xcite .",
    "other semileptonic @xmath0 modes , such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , represent rather more speculative possibilities for the extraction of @xmath57 .",
    "the study of such decays is currently in its infancy for lattice qcd ( see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of some of the challenges ) , but in principle any independent measurement offers the opportunity for greater understanding of the ckm mechanism .",
    "similarly , the @xmath62 provides another exclusive determination of @xmath57 and is currently being explored on the lattice @xcite , in advance of experiments proposed at lhcb @xcite and belle @xcite .",
    "purely leptonic decays of pseudoscalars , such as @xmath63 , are directly sensitive to @xmath57 and therefore offer further insight into this tension .",
    "such decays require a spin - flip , however , and the decay rate is helicity - suppressed by @xmath64 .",
    "only the @xmath65 mode has been observed @xcite .",
    "consequently the experimental uncertainty of the branching ratio prevents determinations of @xmath57 from reaching the precision achieved with the semileptonic modes .",
    "in addition , the leptonic decay @xmath65 is expected to be sensitive to the presence of a charged higgs boson , which is an exciting opportunity for experimentalists , but means that determinations of @xmath57 from this process may be difficult to interpret in terms of explicit unitarity violation . nevertheless , experimental uncertainties will decrease and precise lattice computations will ensure that leptonic decays can ultimately deepen our understanding of the @xmath57 discrepancy .    furthermore , the decay constants that parameterize leptonic decays are crucial ingredients in indirect searches for bsm physics .",
    "observation of the rare @xmath66 decays is one of the key aims of the lhc .",
    "the high sensitivity of these processes to bsm physics ensures that they are amongst the star contenders for `` likeliest channel for new physics results '' .",
    "the branching fractions of these rare decays are proportional to the square of the decay constants , @xmath67 , defined via the matrix elements of the leptonic decays @xmath68 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the temporal component of the axial - vector current and @xmath71 the mass of the @xmath72 meson . although the decay channel @xmath73 is not a physical process , it is nonetheless a process that can be computed within lattice qcd .",
    "in fact , the most precise values for the branching fraction of @xmath66 are obtained by taking a ratio with the @xmath74 mixing mass difference , @xmath75 @xcite . in this case , the dependence on @xmath76 drops out .",
    "determinations using both methods have been remarkably consistent , providing a strong check of the reliability of lattice computations , because the lattice calculations for @xmath25 decays and @xmath77 mixing are rather different .",
    "precise determinations of form factors and decay constants from lattice qcd are therefore of paramount importance in the hunt for bsm physics . and",
    "this is where lpt steps into the fray",
    ". the most up - to - date determinations of form factors and decay constants come from four lattice collaborations using four different formalisms .",
    "the etm collaboration employ twisted mass fermions with @xmath78 species of sea quarks ( with @xmath79 calculations underway ) @xcite , whilst early results from the alpha collaboration on @xmath78 ensembles with @xmath44-improved wilson fermions are now available @xcite .",
    "the fermilab lattice / milc group @xcite and the hpqcd collaboration both use staggered fermion ensembles generated by the milc collaboration , with different valence quark actions .",
    "the hpqcd collaboration has examined a wide range of flavored and unflavored meson decay constants .",
    "the current status of the decay constant `` spectrum '' from the hpqcd collaboration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fspec ] and demonstrates the excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "[ fig : fspec ]    all four collaborations use lpt , albeit to varying degrees .",
    "the hpqcd collaboration has made heavy use of lpt in recent computations , so i turn now to an example for the quark currents used by the hpqcd collaboration .",
    "the hpqcd collaboration has determined both the decay constants @xmath80 and @xmath76 @xcite and the form factors @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "these determinations fall into two classes : the more traditional calculations use nonrelativistic @xmath1 quarks paired with relativistic staggered light quarks whilst recent computations have pioneered a completely relativistic treatment of the @xmath1 quarks using the hisq action .",
    "this entirely relativistic approach has several advantages that significantly improve the precision of the computation ; the resulting value , @xmath81 gev @xcite , is the most precise currently available . using relativistic @xmath1 quarks avoids any need for effective actions and their associated systematic uncertainties , and the hisq action has an absolutely normalized axial - vector current , removing the requirement for renormalization parameter calculations .",
    "this approach does not make lpt redundant , however .",
    "simulations with relativistic @xmath1 quarks are yet to reach the physical point and a determination of @xmath80 is even more computationally demanding .",
    "lattice calculations with nrqcd remain the most competitive method for determining the ratio @xmath82 .",
    "systematic uncertainties associated with the perturbative matching or with neglecting higher order nrqcd terms are correlated between @xmath0 and @xmath25 simulations and therefore cancel in the ratio .",
    "the most precise result available for @xmath80 takes advantage of these cancellations by combining a precise determination of the ratio @xmath82 with the precise determination of @xmath76 using hisq @xmath1 quarks to obtain @xmath83 gev @xcite .",
    "this result would have not been possible without lpt .",
    "heavy - heavy currents are required as part of the extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath84 via exclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "the decay @xmath85 is currently the most important exclusive process for attempts to reconcile the discrepancies between determinations of @xmath84 from inclusive and exclusive channels , but @xmath84 can also be extracted from @xmath86 .",
    "the babar collaboration recently reported an excess of @xmath87 above the expected standard model ratio @xmath88 in both channels @xcite , although a very recent lattice determination has reduced the tension to less than @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "direct access to the ckm matrix element @xmath84 is possible through the leptonic decay @xmath90 , which has decay rate @xmath91 where the decay constant is defined through @xmath92 the experimental difficulties associated with reconstructing the @xmath93 lepton from its decay products are considerable @xcite and this decay is yet to be observed experimentally .",
    "this , however , offers a unique possibility for lattice theorists : the prediction of the leptonic decay rate from lattice computations .",
    "successful predictions lend significantly more weight to our belief in the validity of lattice results than postdictions and are an important aspect of testing lattice qcd .",
    "lattice determinations of the semileptonic @xmath94 decays have so far been dominated by calculations from the fermilab lattice / milc collaboration , which has studied various semileptonic @xmath0 decays , including @xmath95 @xcite , @xmath96 @xcite and the ratio of @xmath97 to @xmath98 @xcite .",

    "the phenomenon of meson - antimeson oscillation is of particular interest to bsm physics hunters .",
    "meson - antimeson mixing is a fcnc process and so , in the standard model , proceeds through one - loop box diagrams .",
    "this makes meson - antimeson mixing a particularly powerful contraint on both ckm unitarity and possible bsm physics .",
    "meson - antimeson mixing occurs in both the @xmath101 and @xmath102 systems and is primarily mediated by top quarks .",
    "determinations of the oscillation frequencies , @xmath103 and @xmath75 respectively , directly constrain the ckm unitarity triangle through the standard model relations @xmath104 where @xmath105 may be either a @xmath106 or @xmath107 quark . here",
    "the @xmath108 are the decay constants discussed in the previous section and the @xmath109 are the renormalization group invariant bag parameters , the decay constants and bag parameters parameterize the nonperturbative matrix elements defined by @xmath110 which are expressed in terms of the scale dependent bag parameters @xmath111 .",
    "the relation between @xmath111 and @xmath109 is known perturbatively to next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "although both @xmath103 and @xmath75 directly constrain the apex of the ckm unitarity triangle , the su(3 ) breaking ratio @xmath112 provides a more stringent bound on ckm matrix unitarity because many systematic uncertainties cancel in this ratio .",
    "new physics may couple to the @xmath113 and @xmath102 systems differently and so separate constraints from both @xmath103 and @xmath75 are required .",
    "precise determinations of the matrix elements in eq .   require lattice qcd . and",
    "extracting continuum results from these lattice computations is once again a job for lpt .",
    "an exploratory study by the rbc / ukqcd collaboration found @xmath114 using a single lattice spacing on @xmath115 dynamical domain wall configurations with static @xmath1 quarks @xcite .",
    "lpt was used to improve the axial - vector current and match the results to the continuum @xcite . a more precise calculation by the hpqcd collaboration employed asqtad light valence quarks and nrqcd @xmath1 quarks on ensembles with @xmath115 asqtad sea quarks @xcite .",
    "using the perturbative matching results of @xcite , the hpqcd collaboration obtained @xmath116 .",

    "most recently , the fermilab lattice / milc collaboration found @xmath117 using the same @xmath118 asqtad configurations , with asqtad light valence quarks and @xmath1 quarks implemented with the fermilab action .",
    "details of the perturbative calculation required for this result are forthcoming .      although not directly measurable , the mass of the @xmath1 quark is nevertheless an important object of study , both as a free parameter of the standard model and as an input into searches for bsm physics .",
    "the most precise nonperturbative result currently available for the @xmath1 quark mass ( expressed in the modified minimal subtraction , or @xmath119 , scheme ) is @xmath120 gev , from a relativistic hisq calculation by the hpqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "two different determinations using @xmath121 ensembles from the alpha and etm collaborations are in agreement with the results from heavy hisq simulations . using nonperturbatively tuned hqet , the alpha collaboration obtained a preliminary result of @xmath122 gev @xcite , where the first error includes statistical and systematic uncertainties and the second arises from the quark mass renormalization .",
    "an alternative approach was taken by the etm collaboration , using two different methods to find a ( preliminary ) average result of @xmath123 gev @xcite . here",
    "the first uncertainty is statistical and the second the total systematic uncertainty .",

    "an early calculation obtained @xmath124 gev @xcite , where the uncertainty was dominated by the one - loop matching calculation needed to extract the continuum result .",
    "in recently completed work @xcite , the one - loop calculation was extended to two loops using a mixed approach combining automated lpt and weak coupling simulations to extract the heavy quark energy shift .",
    "preliminary indications suggest that this will reduce the uncertainties to the sub percent level : a real vindication of the power of lpt for precision lattice nrqcd .",
    "my focus has so far been the application of lpt to precision tests of the standard model in the hunt for bsm physics .",
    "these efforts require precise theoretical calculations , which , for nonperturbative qcd , often means lattice computations . but how can we be sure that the precision of our computations really is improving and that we are not missing sources of systematic uncertainty ?    to assuage these worries and to ensure that we really are improving the precision of our lattice calculations we need a proven testing ground for our results . in the @xmath0 sector , this testing ground is heavy meson spectroscopy .",
    "the heavy meson spectrum is an excellent arena for testing and quantifying uncertainties associated with lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "there are three reasons for this : firstly there are a number of gold - plated states that are experimentally and theoretically well defined ; secondly there are multiple states that can be used as parameter - free tests of the current status of lattice calculations and their associated uncertainties ; and thirdly and most importantly , there remain a number of experimentally undiscovered states that allow lattice qcd predictions to be tested .",

    "although this mass was reconstructed with a precision of about 400 mev by the cdf collaboration in 1998 @xcite , the resolution was sufficiently poor that a later lattice calculation could claim a `` prediction '' of @xmath125 mev @xcite .",
