    "clusters of galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath1 often exhibit an overabundance , relative to present - day clusters , of blue galaxies ( butcher , oemler 1978 , 1984 ) .",
    "this star - formation activity is often called the butcher  oemler effect , and subsequent studies have confirmed this trend @xcite . at the same time , various studies have reported a morphological evolution in cluster galaxies ; they have shown that the fractions of s0 galaxies in clusters decrease toward a higher redshift ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; couch et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; fasano et al .",
    "2000 ) . for many clusters",
    ", it has been found that their galaxy population gradually changes from a red , evolved , early type population in the inner part of the clusters to a progressively blue , later type population in the extensive outer envelope of the clusters @xcite .",
    "these are often interpreted as being the result that star - forming field disk galaxies infalling to a cluster are transformed to passively evolving cluster members .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed for the transformation . in general ,",
    "galaxies in the inner region of a cluster have lower star - formation rates both at @xmath2 @xcite and at higher redshift ( couch , sharples 1987 ; balogh et al .",

    "ram - pressure stripping of cold gas in the disk of a galaxy is a possible candidate for the suppression of star formation in clusters because the removal of cold gas leads to the exhaustion of an ingredient of stars @xcite , although ram - pressure may cause a mild increase of star formation of a galaxy @xcite or a starburst with a short - time scale @xcite .",
    "ram - pressure stripping is likely to take place in the central regions of clusters because the density of intracluster medium ( icm ) is high there .",
    "in fact , disk galaxies with a deficit of cold gas or a morphological sign of gas removal are often observed near cluster centers ( cayatte et al . 1990 ; vollmer et al . 2000 ; bravo - alfaro et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; solanes et al . 2001",
    "; bureau , carignan 2002 ; vollmer 2003 ; sofue et al .",
    "2003 ; yoshida et al .",
    "moreover , it is more effective in richer clusters because the typical velocity of galaxies is larger .",
    "several authors actually indicated that the fractions of blue galaxies are systematically lower for rich clusters than for poor clusters at a given redshift @xcite , which is consistent with a suppression of the star - formation activities by ram - pressure stripping . on the other hand , @xcite investigated clusters with small masses at @xmath3 , and indicated that the striking similarity between the spectral and morphological properties of galaxies in these clusters and those of galaxies in more massive systems at similar redshifts implies that the physical processes responsible for truncating star formation in galaxies are not restricted to the rare , rich cluster environment , but are viable in much more common environments .",
    "thus , they concluded that ram - pressure stripping can not be solely responsible for the low star - formation rates in these systems .",
    "moreover , several authors indicated that ram - pressure stripping can not account for the suppression of star formation observed @xmath4mpc away from the center of a cluster @xcite , although we will show that it is not obvious .",
    "@xcite suggested that an infall from gaseous galactic halos might be important for sustaining star formation in spiral galaxies and that the gas in these halos might be stripped in the cluster environment , leading to the formation of passively evolving s0 galaxies .",
    "although the gas in galactic halos , which we call ` warm gas ' , has not been detected in nearby spiral galaxies @xcite , models of galaxy formation based on the hierarchical clustering scenario have often assumed such an infall , and have been very successful in accounting for the properties of galaxies at optical and infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "if only warm gas is stripped , star formation may be allowed to continue by consuming the remaining cold disk gas , but without the infall to replenish this supply , star formation will die out on timescales of a few gyr @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with observations that indicate a slow decline of the star - formation rates of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we call this scenario ` strangulation ' from now on . in this paper",
    ", we also consider the evaporation of cold gas in disk galaxies by energy transfer via thermal conduction from the surrounding hot icm as another mechanism for the slow decline of the star - formation rates .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time that the redshift evolution of the evaporation effect has been studied .",
    "the above mechanisms , that is , ram - pressure stripping , strangulation , and evaporation , mainly have an influence on the star - formation activities of galaxies .",
    "contrary to them , galaxy mergers are expected to significantly affect the morphology of galaxies .",
    "thus , mergers may have played an important role in the observed morphological transformation in clusters .",
    "mergers between galaxies with comparable masses ( major mergers ) could create elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , major mergers alone can not account for the observed fractions of galaxies with intermediate bulge - to - disk luminosity ratios such as s0 galaxies in clusters @xcite .",
    "okamoto and nagashima ( 2003 ) indicated that mergers between galaxies with significantly different masses ( minor mergers ) may produce the galaxies with intermediate bulge - to - disk luminosity ratios because these mergers do not disrupt galactic disks completely .    in this paper",
    ", we consider possible mechanisms responsible for the truncation of star formation and morphological transformation of disk galaxies in clusters .",
    "in particular , we investigate the evolution of disk galaxies in subclusters .",
    "recent observations show that galaxies have already been affected by some environmental effects in subclusters @xcite .",
    "we define subclusters as clusters located around a larger cluster ( main cluster ) at relatively high redshift ; these subclusters are to be merged with the main cluster until @xmath5 .",
    "thus , at high redshift , we can say that these subclusters are progenitors of the main cluster at @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , at low redshift , they become subhalos included in the main cluster .",
    "since high - resolution @xmath6-body simulations showed that a subcluster that has been included in the main cluster as a subhalo is not completely destroyed @xcite , we do not explicitly discriminate a subcluster from a subhalo .",
    "however , we can estimate the time when subclusters are included by the main cluster ( see section [ sec : result ] ) .",
    "we consider the effect of cosmological evolution of clusters since the inner structure of clusters at high redshift is not the same as that at low redshifts , which makes differences of environmental effects on cluster galaxies at between high and low redshift .",
    "we take an analytical approach to study the environmental effects because at the moment it is difficult to study their redshift evolutions by genuine numerical simulations . for example",
    ", it is virtually impossible to study ram - pressure stripping of galaxies in clusters by cosmological numerical simulations including both dark matter and gas with a resolution that is sufficient to treat the interaction between icm and interstellar gas in each galaxy correctly .",
    "even if we introduce some assumptions about the stripping of the interstellar gas and the distribution of the icm , as is done by okamoto and nagashima ( 2003 ) , we need to find the average cluster and galaxy evolutions at least in terms of their dark halos .",
    "however , it is time - consuming to create many clusters by performing high - resolution @xmath6-body simulations to follow the average cluster and galaxy evolutions .",
    "moreover , there is another merit for analytical approaches . even in the future , when full numerical simulations are enabled",
    ", the simulations must include many physical processes , and it would be difficult to divide them when the results are analyzed . the division is easier for analytical studies , and the results of analytical studies would be very useful to be compared with those of numerical simulations .",
    "we also emphasize that our model is different from previous semi - analytic models .",
    "our model takes account of spatial correlations among initial density fluctuations , and can specifically predict the evolution of subclusters around the main cluster . on the other hand , previous models can not discriminate between subclusters and the main cluster .",
    "we mainly consider massive disk galaxies since they can be observed in detail even at high redshift .",
    "thus , we do not consider the cumulative effect of high - speed encounters between galaxies ( ` galaxy harassment ' ) because it influences disk galaxies with small masses @xcite .",
    "we mostly study the redshift evolution of each environmental effect and discuss the relative strength of the effect at high and low redshift .",
    "we also compare results with observations qualitatively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we summarize our models . in section  [ sec :",
    "result ] we give the results of our calculations , and compare them with observations in section  [ sec : disc ] .",

    "in this study , the average mass of progenitors of a cluster is derived from the extend press  schechter model ( eps ) @xcite and its further extention @xcite .",
    "the latter is a press  schechter model including the effect of spatial correlations among initial density fluctuations ( sps ) .",

    "moreover , the results of numerical simulations show that the mass distribution in the outer region of clusters is approximately given by equation ( [ eq : rho_m ] ) with @xmath70 ( navarro et al .",

    "thus , the morphological transformation may be due to a change of q - parameter after strangulation @xcite or tidal acceleration from a cluster potential on galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that early - type spirals in cluster cores appear to be more perturbed than their counterparts in the cluster peripheries by a factor of 2 .",
    "this result suggests that early - type spiral galaxies in clusters likely experienced gravitationally induced disturbances as they pass near the cluster cores , in a massive main cluster , cold gas of a disk galaxy may have to be removed or consumed until the galaxy is affected by the tidal acceleration in the central region of the cluster ; otherwise the kinetic pressure on the cold gas and the star - formation rate of the galaxy would increase there , which is inconsistent with observations of massive clusters @xcite .",
    "a galaxy may have to pass the cluster ( or subcluster ) center several times until the morphology is significantly changed .",
    "numerical simulations done by @xcite showed that in a cluster , galaxies follow almost radial orbits rather than circular ones even after their first infalls to the cluster .",
    "it is to be noted that @xcite indicated that the morphological transformation by tidal force may occur even in the outer region of a hierarchically growing cluster .",
    "thus , some of observed s0 galaxies were formed outside the core of a cluster .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the morphology - density relation of galaxies holds even the outside of a cluster .",
    "this suggests that the morphological change does not take place in field regions but in subclusters .",
    "finally , we point out that some of blue disk galaxies observed in clusters may be galaxies that restart star formation after they have passed the central regions of the clusters . although the cold gas of these galaxies was once removed by ram - pressure stripping , the galaxies could accumulate cold gas again from the gas ejected from their stars if ram - pressure drops enough .",
    "the condition that cold gas is accumulated again is given by @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the gas ejection rate from stars @xcite . comparing equation  ( [ eq : strip ] ) with equation  ( [ eq : ret ] )",
    ", one finds that the threshold values are very similar for a massive disk galaxy we study .",
    "thus , the gas accumulation and star formation would resume at @xmath288 after the galaxy passed the central region of a cluster .",
    "a detailed discussion of the resumed star formation is beyond the scope of this paper , because the orbit of a galaxy that has passed the center of a cluster is gradually affected by gravity from other galaxies and changing potential well of the host cluster .",
    "numerical simulations are needed to follow the orbits of galaxies for a long time .",
    "we note that using a numerical simulation , @xcite showed that the star formation of galaxies is suppressed during a cluster merger , because the ram - pressure on galaxies increases and ram - pressure stripping becomes effective .",
    "however , they also showed that after a smaller cluster passed the center of a larger cluster , star formation resumes because of the decrease of ram - pressure and the accumulation of cold gas in the galaxies .",
    "moreover , from @xmath6-body numerical simulations of cluster formation , @xcite indicated that a significant fraction of galaxies beyond the virial radius of a cluster may have been within the main body of the cluster in the past .",
    "these galaxies would resume the star - formation activities .",
    "using analytical models based on a hierarchical clustering scenario , we have investigated the evolution of massive disk galaxies in clusters .",
    "we have considered the effects of cosmological evolution of clusters on galaxy evolution . in particular , we have explored the galaxy evolution in subclusters located around the main cluster .",
    "the main conclusions from this work may be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) as long as the spatial distribution of intracluster medium ( icm ) follows that of dark matter in a cluster or a subcluster , galaxies are influenced by ram - pressure stripping of the cold disk gas . for a given massive cluster at @xmath5 ,",
    "ram - pressure stripping in the cluster progenitors is more effective at higher redshift although the masses of the cluster progenitors decrease with redshift .",
    "this is because the typical mass density of the progenitors increases with the redshift . even in subclusters , ram - pressure stripping is effective .",
    "\\(ii ) if field galaxies directly fall into a main cluster , the exhaustion of the cold disk gas via star formation , after stripping of the warm diffuse gas in their galactic halos ( ` strangulation ' ) , would not be completed before ram - pressure stripping of the cold disk gas becomes effective .",
    "this limits the time scale in which star - formation rates of the galaxies decline .",
    "the maximum time scale is @xmath289  gyr , which is inconsistent with some observations .",
    "\\(iii ) the conflict between the theoretical prediction and the observations may be avoided if the star - formation rates of galaxies had already dropped in subclusters before the subclusters plunged into the main cluster ( ` pre - processing ' ) .",
    "this is consistent with recent observations indicating that the star - formation rates of galaxies are decreased at radii well larger than the virial radii of main clusters .",
    "\\(iv ) the star - formation rates of galaxies in subclusters might have gradually decreased via strangulation and/or evaporation of the cold gas by the surrounding hot icm , if non - gravitational heating of icm ( ` preheating ' ) had changed the icm distributions of the subclusters , and tidal force from the main cluster prevents the galaxies from being affected by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "these may be the mechanism of the pre - processing .",
    "in particular , the evaporation scenario is free from the problem that warm gas in galactic halos has not been detected .",
    "\\(v ) it is not obvious whether ram - pressure stripping takes place in subclusters ( or main clusters at high redshift ) or not . even if future observations show that ram - pressure stripping does not occur in subclusters ( or main clusters at high redshift ) , their small masses can not be the only reason .",
    "it requires additional reasons , such as the preheating and/or the tidal acceleration .",
    "\\(vi ) mergers between a galaxy at the center of a cluster progenitor and that not at the center had mostly finished at @xmath272@xmath290 because the velocities of galaxies increase as the host clusters grow .",
    "thus , galaxy mergers do not appear to be the main cause of the observed morphological transformation from spiral galaxies to s0 galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "\\(vii ) the star - formation activity of a galaxy may resume after the galaxy has passed the central region of a cluster and the ram - pressure from the icm has dropped .",
    "this may affect the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters .",
