    "dispersion measures ( dms ) towards pulsars with known distance @xmath7 can be used to derive the mean electron density in the galaxy through the relation @xmath8 . for pulsars located at @xmath9 the derived mean electron density in the galactic plane",
    "is @xmath10 @xmath5 , and @xmath11 @xmath5 in the spiral arms and inter - arm regions , respectively ( ferrire 2001 ; gaensler et al . 2008 ) .",
    "berkhuijsen & fletcher ( 2008 ) , using the dms towards 34 pulsars , mostly outside the galactic plane , showed that the @xmath12 follows a gaussian distribution , relating it to the nature of the interstellar turbulence ( see e.g. reviews by elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "so far , numerical ( magnetized and unmagnetized ) 3d simulations have assumed collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) conditions for the ism .",
    "in fact the thermal evolution of the ism is determined by heating and cooling processes , which in general are not synchronized with ionization and recombination processes , respectively ( e.g. , kafatos 1973 ; shapiro & moore 1976 ) .",
    "hence , below @xmath13 k , deviations from cie conditions occur , thereby affecting the ionization structure of the interstellar gas , and thus the local electron density . in particular ,",
    "if delayed recombination plays a role , the number of free electrons may be severely underestimated ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ) .    here",
    "we study the electron density , @xmath0 , and it s mean , @xmath14 , in the galactic disk ( up to 200 pc on either side of the midplane ) using the first to date global hydrodynamical simulation of the interstellar gas , evolving under nei conditions .",
    "furthermore , we compare simulation results with estimates of @xmath14 obtained from available pulsar dms . in forthcoming papers we explore the @xmath0 distribution and it s topology in the thick disk and halo of the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 deals with the model setup ; sections 3 and 4 present the observational data , and simulation results , respectively .",
    "a discussion and final remarks in section 5 close the paper .",
    "we simulate hydrodynamically the supernova - driven ism in a patch of the galaxy centered at the solar circle with an area of 1 kpc@xmath15 and extending to 15 kpc on either side of the galactic midplane following de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 , 2007 ; ab0507 ) .",
    "the simulations are carried out with the eaf - parallel adaptive mesh refinement code coupled to the newly developed e(a+m)pec code ; avillez & breitschwerdt 2012 ) featuring the time - dependent calculation on the spot ( at each grid cell ) of the ionization structure of h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s and fe and emissivities .    the physical model includes supernovae ( sne ) types ia , ib+c , and ii , a gravitational field provided by the stars in the disk , local self - gravity ( excluding the contribution from the newly formed stars ) , heat conduction ( dalton & balbus 1993 ) , uniform heating due to a uv radiation field normalized to the galactic value and varying with @xmath16 , and photoelectric heating of grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "e(a+m)pec uses the recommended abundances of asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and calculates electron impact ionization , inner - shell excitation auto - ionization , radiative and dielectronic recombination , charge - exchange reactions ( recombination with hi  and hei ,  and ionization with hiiand heii ) , continuum ( bremsstrahlung , free - bound , two - photon ) and line ( permitted , semi - forbidden and forbidden ) emission in the range 1  -610@xmath17 .",
    "the code also includes ionization of hiby lyman continuum photons emitted during the recombination of helium .",
    "the internal energy of the plasma includes the contributions due to the thermal translational energy plus the energy stored in ( or delivered ) from high ionization stages .",
    "electron impact ionization rates are taken from dere ( 2007 ) , while radiative and dielectronic recombination rates are based on autostructure calculations ( badnell et al .",
    "2003 , badnell 2006a ) including the latest corrections to fe ions by badnell ( 2006b ) , nikolic et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and schmidt et al .",
    "radiative and dielectronic recombination rates for siiand feviiare from mazzotta el al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for the remaining ions we adopt the total recombination rates derived with the unified electron - ion recombination method ( nahar & pradhan 1994 ) and available at norad - atomic - datanahar and references therein . ] .",
    "a coarse grid resolution of 8 pc is used , while the finest amr resolution is @xmath18pc ( 4 levels of refinement ) for @xmath19 kpc , 4 pc for @xmath20 kpc , and 1 pc elsewhere .",
    "periodic and outflow boundary conditions are set along the vertical faces and top / bottom ( @xmath21 kpc ) of the grid , respectively .",
    "distribution as obtained with a series of 24 pulsars located at @xmath22  pc from the sun , with @xmath23 pc .",
    "the mean value is @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "red solid and dashed lines refer , respectively , to the histogram and gaussian fit ( centered at @xmath26 @xmath5 and having a dispersion @xmath3 ) of the @xmath27 (  4 ) . ]",
    "to make a detailed comparison between simulation results ( discussed below ) and the electron density distribution derived from dms towards pulsars , we reassessed the existing data to select pulsars with best possible distance estimates .",
    "density pdfs were created using pulsars located up to 8 kpc away from the sun and with @xmath28 pc from the galaxy s midplane .",
    "for our analysis we chose pulsars from the atnf catalog @xcite with independent distance estimates , i.e. , estimates without using ne2001 model ( cordes & lazio 2003 ; cl03 ) .",
    "these estimates resulted from parallax measurements , absorption - line ( hi21-cm or oh line ) studies , physical associations or timing towards pulsars in the galactic disk ( @xmath29 pc ) .",
    "most parallax estimates were obtained from @xcite , which are updated by chatterjee , s ..    for our study we augmented the atnf catalog by including distance estimates from absorption studies wherever available from the literature , including two measurements from associations ( frail et al , 1996 ; saravanan et al . 1996",
    "; johnston et al . 2003 ; minter et al 2008 ; weisberg et al 2008 ; see references therein ) . to quantify errors in distance estimates , we compute the fractional error involved in parallax and absorption studies from the difference between the upper and lower estimates .",
    "firm error estimates are not available for several pulsars in the atnf catalog , whereby the fractional error was computed from the difference between the distance estimate and the best estimate available from ne2001 model ( parameter dist1 in atnf catalog ) .",
    "errors in distance estimates using parallax measurements range between @xmath30 . the median error in distance estimate in our overall sample",
    "is @xmath31 , a significant improvement over estimates using ne2001 model ( cl03 ) .",
    "a total of 122 pulsars with reliable distance estimates were thus selected , @xmath32 of which have @xmath29  pc .",
    "nine pulsars were removed from this sample as they are located within the vicinity of the sun , and measurements of electron density towards those sightlines are significantly affected by local structures , such as the local bubble , gum nebula and loop  i ( e.g. , cl03 ) .",
    "the histogram of the computed @xmath33 derived from the sample dms and the best - fit gaussian curve are shown in figure  [ observ ] ( black lines ) .",
    "the fit is centered at @xmath34 and has a dispersion of @xmath35 , with a @xmath36 .",
    "these values compare well with those derived directly from our pulsar sample data : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the simulated supernova - driven interstellar medium is characterized by several evolutionary phases that have already been described in previous works : ( i ) domination of initial conditions being only wiped out after some 80 myr of evolution , ( ii ) the full establishment of the continuous disk - halo - disk circulation ( also known as the galactic fountain ) , and ( iii ) the dynamical equilibrium ( occurring at 200 - 220 myr of evolution ) in a statistical sense that determines the dynamics of the interstellar medium in the galactic disk and its interaction with the halo . as a result of this evolutionary path driven mainly by supervovae , the ism becomes frothy and turbulent with a mean mach number of 3 ( ab0507 ) .",
    "low temperature gas ( high density ) is concentrated into filamentary structures and molecular clouds ( black regions in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , showing the galactic midplane density at 400 myr of evolution ) , while hot gas ( low density regions in the same panel ) is concentrated into bubbles and superbubbles that dominate the landscape .",
    "+     +     the turbulent nature of the simulated ism , the ongoing physical processes and driving mechanisms ( e.g. , sne and stellar winds ) affect the electron distribution , which follows the topology of the medium .",
    "most of the electrons are distributed into the thermally unstable regime ( @xmath6 k ) with a volume ( @xmath39 ) and mass ( @xmath40 ) filling fractions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ( figure  [ avepdf ] : top panel ) ; @xmath43 of the electron mass is locked in filamentary structures and shells , having @xmath44 .",
    "the electron distribution in warm ionized medium has @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these are time - dependent variations whose time average ( over a period of 100 myr using 1001 disk snapshots taken at every 0.1 myr ) histogram of @xmath47 ( figure  [ avepdf ] : bottom panel ) , is fitted with a composition of two gaussians centered at @xmath48 ( for t@xmath49 k gas ) and @xmath50 ( for t@xmath51 k gas ) , respectively , with the latter representing mostly photoionized regions .",
    "further insight into the simulated electron distribution can be obtained directly from dms along los , with length @xmath7 , crossing the simulated ism , allowing the determination of the mean electron density .",
    "the los have increasing lengths ( with a step length of 10 pc ) up to 1 kpc from a vantage point located at @xmath52 ( left bottom corner of the electron density maps in figure  [ fig1 ] ) for @xmath23 pc and spanning @xmath53 ( with a @xmath54 separation ) when projected onto the galactic midplane .",
    "+   +    figure  [ dmangle ] shows the dm along the los with lengths varying between 100 and 1000 pc , with a step length of 100 pc at 350 and 400 myr ( top two panels ) and its time average ( bottom panel ) over 501 disk snapshots taken every 0.1 myr for @xmath55 myr of evolution . due to the ongoing turbulent processes in the galactic disk the dm has variability along and between the lines of sight ( figure  [ dmangle ] : top two panels ) .",
    "the longitudinal variation is due to the inhomogeineity of the ism ( e.g. , bubbles and superbubbles ) as well as due to the turbulent nature of the regions crossed by the los .",
    "these variations with distance and among los are still present in the time averaged dm , although the longitudinal variations are smoothed in the averaging process . however , a record of any event that prevailed over a large period of time ( e.g. , a superbubble whose contribution to the dm is small as in the case of the observed hump in the dm between 48and 65 ) is kept .",
    "( bottom panel ) for all los crossing the disk up to 4 kpc from the sun at 310 myr ( @xmath56 ; red lines ) , 360 myr ( @xmath57 ; green lines ) , and over the period 350 - 400 myr ( @xmath58 ; black lines ) .",
    "the blue circles represent the dms ( top ) and @xmath59 ( bottom ) derived from pulsars observations . ]",
    "we further compare the dms and @xmath59 derived from pulsars observations (  3 ) , with those resulting from averaging over all the los crossing the simulated disk ( @xmath28 pc ) and up to 4 kpc from the sun at specific times ( e.g. , 310 and 360 myr ) and over the period 350 - 400 myr .",
    "top panel of figure  [ taver ] displays the observationally derived dms and the averaged dms at 310 myr ( @xmath60 ; red lines ) , 360 myr ( @xmath61 ; green lines ) , and over the period 350 - 400 myr ( @xmath62 ; black lines ) .    due to the limitation of the box size in our simulation",
    ", we calculated the dms for distance @xmath63 kpc taking advantage of the periodic boundary conditions used in the simulations .",
    "the dms were calculated from different vantage points in the midplane ( including @xmath64 and between 500 and 1400 pc from it ) using los crossing the disk volume at different angles , up to 4 kpc from the vantage point and up to @xmath65 pc .",
    "this procedure , although inevitable here , may introduce artefacts in the simulation results , but we do not expect that our results are strongly affected though , because the simulation shows a certain pattern repetition in the ism density and temperature distributions on scales of the order of a few correlation lengths ( that is , a few times 75 pc , according to ab0507 ) .",
    "the averaged @xmath62 , after a steep growth in the first 100 pc , reaches a smooth increase for @xmath66 pc , with the deviations of the minimum and maximum regarding the mean becoming constant over distance - consistent with the dms variations in @xmath7 observed in figure  [ dmangle ] .",
    "the averaged dms at 310 and 360 myr vary widely , but with values within the pulsar derived dms .",
    "therefore , the terms minimum and maximum of the @xmath62 should not be taken as strict upper and lower values for all times , as they only represent an average over a specific time window of the simulation .    after the large variation in the first few hundred parsecs , the mean of the simulated @xmath67 , for the cases shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ taver ] , reach a constant value ( @xmath68 @xmath5 ) and dispersion over large distances .",
    "this reflects the clumpy nature of the electrons in the turbulent ism as would be expected if they are predominantly found in filaments and shells ( berkhuijsen & mller 2008 ) .",
    "the histogram of the @xmath69 and it s best gaussian fit are displayed in figure  [ observ ] by solid and dashed red lines , respectively .",
    "the fit is centered at @xmath70 with @xmath71 . in the simulated disk ,",
    "the clumpy material dominates the los and volume averaged pdfs which explains the similar means between the electron density of the t@xmath49 k regime ( figure  [ avepdf ] ) and the time averaged @xmath72 ( figure  [ observ ] ; red lines ) .",
    "these fit parameters are similar to those displayed in figure  [ observ ] ( black lines ) for observationally derived @xmath67 .",
    "this similarity is indicative of the smoothing out of low and high density regions along the lines of sight , thus , not appearing in the pdfs , and leading to reduced gaussian dispersion .",
    "in this letter we discuss the electron density distribution in the galactic disk using the first to date 3d high resolution nei simulations of the ism .",
    "the simulations trace the dynamical and thermal evolution of the interstellar gas , calculating on - the - spot the ionization structure , electron distribution and cooling function of the gas at each cell of the grid into which the computational domain is discretized .",
    "we did not take into account stellar ionizing photons and their transport , but an averaged diffuse photon field , which should be a reasonable approximation , when describing the mesoscale ism .",
    "the nei structure modifies the cooling function , which in turn enhances the number of free electrons .",
    "both the simulated dms and electron density are consistent with the observations : ( i)nmost dms lie within the maximum and minimum observed values ,",
    "( ii ) @xmath33 is consistent with a gaussian distribution , ( iii ) the mean electron density is @xmath73 @xmath5 , and ( iv ) the volume filling fraction of the wim is bracketed between 4.9 and 6% .",
    "these results lye in between the estimates by gaensler et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and berkuijsen & mller ( 2008 ) for the electron density in the disk and wim .",
    "furthermore , the observed gaussian distribution is present , irrespective of whether the ism is isothermal ( see discussion in berkuijsen & fletcher ( 2008 ) and refereces therein ) or not .",
    "this can be explained in two complementary ways : a fully developed turbulent system can be considered as a large number of independent random variables , with the logarithm of each having a certain distribution approaching a gaussian as the number of variables goes to infinity ( central limit theorem ) , being the case of supernova - driven ism simulations reaching a statistical equilibrium ( see , e.g. , vzquez - semadeni & garcia 2001 ) . or , alternatively , we can use the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "the information entropy of a continuous random variable @xmath74 with probability density function @xmath75 is defined as @xmath76 .",
    "the lognormal distribution of @xmath74 maximizes @xmath77 , implying the least prior knowledge of the system ( sveshnikov , 1968 ) .",
    "this is exactly what is expected in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with a large number of independent random variables .",
    "we study deviations from lognormal distributions in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for the detailed report and valuable suggestions that allowed us to improved this letter .",
    "the milipeia supercomputer ( univ . of coimbra ) and the ism - cluster ( univ . of vora ) were heavily used for the calculations .",
