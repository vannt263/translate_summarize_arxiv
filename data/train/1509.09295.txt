    "during the advancement of quantum information science , search for correlations having truly quantum nature has been in focus .",
    "quantum entanglement @xcite , a manifestation of quantum correlation , has emerged as the key ingredient in several protocols related to quantum communication @xcite and computation @xcite . over time , exciting results such as non - zero non - classical efficiency of quantum states having vanishing entanglement , and locally indistinguishable orthogonal product states @xcite have resulted in the development of quantum correlations beyond the `` entanglement - separability '' paradigm , broadly known as the quantum information - theoretic measures @xcite . this has led to a large set of _ bona fide _ measures of quantum correlations ( see @xcite , and the references therein ) , each of which , belonging usually to either of the two paradigms , has its own degree of importance , applicability , and computability .",
    "the measures of quantum correlations , belonging to the entanglement - separability domain , are significantly different from those of the quantum information - theoretic origin , as indicated by their several properties ( see @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "for example , entanglement measures are monotone under local operations and classical communication , whereas information - theoretic ones are not .",
    "besides , a quantum state with vanishing entanglement can have a non - zero value of a chosen quantum information - theoretic measure , thereby putting the two of them on a different footing . also , recent studies have shown that , under different types of environmental noise , entanglement exhibits a `` sudden death '' and vanishes at a finite time @xcite , while a quantum information - theoretic measures decays asymptotically with time @xcite , showing a more robust behavior against decoherence .",
    "it is also noteworthy that under specific initial conditions , quantum information theoretic measures may remain invariant over time @xcite , while the entanglement measures exhibit no such property ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , despite such differences , measures from the two domains show some similar behavior in a variety of physical scenarios . in the case of pure states , all the bipartite measures belonging to the two classes",
    "behave quite similarly @xcite .",
    "also , quantum correlation measures , irrespective of their origin , can be made monogamous by a suitable choice of monotonically increasing function of the measure @xcite .",
    "moreover , measures from both the areas can be used to detect cooperative phenomena such as quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite , and the `` order - from - disorder '' phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether an interlink exists between the values obtained from the different measures of quantum correlations having drastically different origins .",
    "there has been efforts to relate the measures of quantum correlations belonging to the two different paradigms @xcite , although no conclusive result , as yet , exists .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the statistical properties of the different measures of quantum correlation , belonging to either of the paradigms , exhibit a universal behavior . towards this aim ,",
    "we analyze the frequency distribution of first - significant digits of quantum correlations of both the classes obtained in different situations .",
    "an empirical law , known as the benford s law , has been studied in varied fields including biology , geology , finance models , etc .",
    "@xcite , and states , in particular , that the first significant digit in any data is more often @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown that the law is satisfied by several data sets obtained from various natural phenomena , while it can be violated in different physical systems including quantum spin models @xcite .",
    "we show that the frequency distribution of the first significant digits occurring in a dataset corresponding to a measure of quantum correlation shows a decaying profile .",
    "we claim that a universal feature for all quantum correlation measures .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the observed frequency distributions obtained from all the quantum correlations , in the case of arbitrary two - qubit states , tend to follow the benford s law @xcite , and the violation parameter with respect to the benford s law decreases with the increase of the rank of the quantum state",
    ". moreover , we observe that if deviation of benford s law is quantified by distance measures like the mean and standard deviations , and the bhattacharya metric , the benford violation parameter computed with respect to the bhattacharya metric always possesses a lower value compared to the other distance metrics , irrespective of the quantum correlation measure and rank of the states .",
    "we also consider the set of arbitrary two - qubit states in the parametric space , up to local unitary transformations , and verify the universal behavior of the first significant digits .",
    "the universality is found to be a low value of violation of the benford s law , to be quantified below , is retained even when specific subsets of the set of two - qubit states are considered as the sample space for determining the first - digit distributions corresponding to the quantum correlations .",
    "the universality may be hindered due to the constraints that are put to the quantum states when the physical system is governed by a specific hamiltonian .",
    "we investigate this by considering the well - known @xmath1 model in a transverse external magnetic field @xcite , defined on a system of @xmath2 spin-@xmath3 particles .",
    "we find that although the first - digit distribution does not mimic benford s law , both in the case of entanglement and quantum information - theoretic measures except quantum work deficit , the benford violation parameter can detect quantum phase transitions present in this model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we observe that quantum discord changes its features of first - digit distribution qualitatively , by changing specifically from having a decreasing to an increasing trend , when the system changes from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phases . to observe the effect of increasing the number of parties and the dimensions of the systems , we also investigate the digit - distributions of distance - based entanglement and monogamy - based quantum correlation measures for three - qubit pure states , and computable quantum correlation measures for bipartite systems in higher dimensions .",
    "specifically , we show that the observed frequency distribution of first significant digits obtained from the geometric measure of entanglement in the case of three - qubit systems can distinguish between two inequivalent classes of pure states , namely , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) class and the w class @xcite .",

    "the study of the statistics of leading digits started in 1881 @xcite , when astronomer simon newcomb observed that the occurrence of the digits @xmath0 to @xmath4 as the first significant digit of the numbers in a given set of data is not randomly distributed .",
    "specifically , it was noticed that there exists many data sets for which the digit `` @xmath0 '' occurs almost @xmath5 of the times , the digit `` @xmath6 '' almost @xmath7 , and the decreasing trend continues up to the digit `` @xmath4 '' , which appears almost @xmath8 of the times . the frequency distribution , @xmath9 , of the first significant digits , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ,",

    "are multiplied with a factor @xmath18 in the case of all the measures of quantum correlation .",
    "all quantities are dimensionless . ]",
    "interestingly , not all naturally occurring datasets obey benford s law .",
    "the deviation of the observed frequency distribution , @xmath19 , can be quantified by computing the distance of @xmath19 from @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity , known as the `` _ _ benford violation parameter _ _ '' ( bvp ) , @xmath20 @xcite , depends on the two distributions as well as the distance - metric used to quantify the separation between them . for the present study , we consider three specific metrics , namely , the mean deviation ( md ) , the standard deviation ( sd ) , and the bhattacharya metric ( bm ) , in terms of which the corresponding bvp are given by @xcite @xmath21 ^ 2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\\\ \\nu_{bm}&=&-\\ln\\sum_{d=1}^{9}\\left[p_{o}(d)p_{b}(d)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{bvp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 correspond to md , sd , and bm respectively . the concept of violation of benford s law has been used in several scenarios as diverse as economics , election processes , digital image manipulation , seismology , and quantum phase transition @xcite .    in the case of a data collected from a specific physical phenomenon",
    ", the measured quantity , @xmath22 , usually has its own range of values , which might lead to a trivial violation of the benford s law .",
    "for example , in a data corresponding to @xmath22 having values @xmath23 , the first significant digit will always be @xmath24 .",
    "such triviality can be avoided by suitable shifting and scaling of @xmath22 , achieved by the `` benford s quantity '' ( bq ) , @xmath25 , defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the minimum and the maximum values of @xmath22 in the dataset .",
    "( [ bquant ] ) implies a mapping of the actual range of @xmath22 onto the range @xmath29 $ ] of @xmath30 .",
    "such a scaling also allows one to compare the different first - digit distributions obtained from quantities having different physical origins .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      in all the qubit systems considered so far in this paper , we have generated quantum states uniformly in either the state space , or the parameter space of the corresponding states . in all these cases , we have seen that quantum correlation measures almost follow the benford s law and can not detect the generation process of the states .",
    "however , there exist physical systems in which the allowed quantum states are governed by the hamiltonian describing the system .",
    "it is , thus , natural to ask what happens to such unifying features of @xmath19 , corresponding to different quantum correlations , if it is constrained by the system hamiltonian . to address this question",
    ", we consider a well - known quantum spin model , namely , the @xmath1 model in a transverse external field , given by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath35 ,    \\label{xyham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the strengths of the coupling constant and the transverse field , @xmath38 is the anisotropy parameter , @xmath2 is the number of spin-@xmath3 particles in the system . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the model undergoes a qpt from a quantum paramagnetic phase to an antiferromagntic phase @xcite , which is detected by several quantum correlation measures @xcite , as well as bvp corresponding to the transverse magnetization of the ground state @xcite .",
    "it is of course also detected by standard condensed matter physics techniques @xcite .    in the present study , we are interested to look at the profile of @xmath19 of the zero - temperature state in the different phases of the model .",
    "note here that the present case is an example where the observable , @xmath22 , may have an allowed range of values in the corresponding phase , and thus may result in a trivial violation of the benford s law , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ blaw ] . to avoid such trivial violations , we employ the following procedure @xcite .",
    "let us assume that in a particular phase , @xmath22 is bounded in the range @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we consider a fixed value of the system parameter , @xmath41 , in the given phase , and choose a small interval around @xmath42 , of width @xmath43 , given by @xmath44 . in this interval , we sample @xmath45 values of @xmath46 . corresponding to those @xmath45 values of @xmath47",
    ", we create a data of @xmath45 values of @xmath22 , in which the range of @xmath22 is given by @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "next , we scale the observable , @xmath22 , so that all of the @xmath45 data points in @xmath48 $ ] now lie in the range @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "this is achieved by a scaling similar to that described in eq .",
    "( [ bquant ] ) , where @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , and the scaled data now belongs to the corresponding bq , @xmath30 .",
    "the next step is to determine the frequency distribution of first significant digits from the data of @xmath30 , which provides the @xmath19 corresponding to the system parameter @xmath51 .",
    "we choose two specific values of the system parameter @xmath46 , given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in two separate phases of the transverse - field @xmath1 model , and determine @xmath19 corresponding to different bipartite measures of quantum correlations for the zero - temperature case of the model . in each case , @xmath19 is computed from a sample of @xmath54 data points in the vicinity of the fixed value of @xmath46 , with a small fixed interval @xmath55 .",
    "curiously , we observe that although the profile of @xmath19 , in the case of entanglement measures , show a complementary behavior to that of @xmath9 , the universality in the behavior of @xmath19 , in the sense that the bvp being small throughout , remains invariant across the qpt . on the other hand , the behavior of @xmath19 corresponding to qd changes across the qpt , similar to the transverse magnetization @xcite , while that corresponding to qwd remains unchanged .",
    "although bvp for entanglement measures can detect qpt , the analysis of @xmath19 reveals that the distribution trend of digits for qd clearly differentiates the two phases , which is not possible by considering entanglement measures .",
    "moreover , the benford satisfying nature of the digit distribution , @xmath19 , in the sense that both @xmath19 and @xmath9 have decaying profiles with respect to the first significant digits , for any quantum correlation measure , showing universality among quantum correlation measures , observed for arbitrary two - qubit states as well as restricted classes of states , is washed out when the two - qubit state is generated from a given hamiltonian .",
    "the profiles of @xmath19 against @xmath10 , for @xmath32 as the entanglement measure and qd as the quantum information theoretic measure in the different phases of the transverse - field @xmath1 model , are shown in fig .",
    "one must note here that even a finite sized system , with size as small as @xmath56 , is sufficient to mimic the system in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "an important point to note is that among all the entanglement as well as information theoretic measures , the frequency distribution corresponding to qwd , originated from the ground state of the model , satisfies benford s law most closely .",
    "this is clearly visible from the values of @xmath14 computed from @xmath19 obtained from different measures of quantum correlations in the two different phases of the model ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "it is now natural to ask whether the universal behavior of @xmath19 is generic when systems with higher number of parties , or in higher dimensions are considered .",
    "however , generating multipartite quantum states as well as states in higher dimensions having all possible ranks is itself a non - trivial problem . for the sake of completeness , in our study , we comment on the nature of @xmath19 in the cases of certain paradigmatic classes of states .",
    "more specifically , we consider pure states in three - qubit systems , the complete set of which is constructed by the union of two independent classes of states , namely , the ghz class , and the w class @xcite . in the case of higher - dimensional systems ,",
    "we simulate rank-@xmath6 states in @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    to check for unifying features as in the case of two - qubit systems , we haar uniformly generate sets of @xmath60 states in each of the cases including tripartite pure states of ghz and the w classes , and higher dimensional states in @xmath58 and @xmath59 systems , and determine the relevant quantum correlations .",
    "see appendix for brief descriptions of the ghz class , the w class , and different quantum correlation measures considered .",
    "it is important to note that the measures that we consider for two - qubit systems do not have a direct generalization for three - qubit systems , and hence we choose a distance - based entanglement measure , namely , ggm @xcite , and monogamy based measures @xcite originated from bipartite quantum correlations .    the profiles of @xmath19 and the corresponding values of @xmath20 for different quantum correlations , in all the mentioned cases , are found to be inconclusive in determining whether such universality exists .",
    "note that the multiparty states considered here are pure ( rank-@xmath0 ) states , while all the higher - dimensional bipartite states have rank-@xmath6 , and in the case of qubit systems , the universal feature becomes prominent in the case of states with higher rank .",
    "hence it is reasonable to infer that conclusive result on the universality of the behavior of @xmath19 in the case of multipartite systems as well as systems in higher dimensions can only be obtained once the corresponding states up to their full rank can be considered .",

    "in this paper , we showed that statistics of the first significant digits occurring in the data corresponding to different measures of quantum correlations , belonging to both entanglement - separability as well as the information - theoretic paradigms , exhibit a universal feature . more specifically , according to our data - analysis , the frequency distribution of the first significant digits in the numbers corresponding to any _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlation tend to obey benford s law , when states with higher ranks are considered , irrespective of their origin and nature , in general .",
    "this feature becomes prominent when quantum states with full rank are considered .",
    "we also discuss the effect of a specific hamiltonian governing the quantum system on such universality , which shows that the entanglement measures for bipartite states generated from the @xmath1 hamiltonian in a transverse field do not follow benford s law .",
    "such investigation revealed that the first - digit distribution of qd in the paramagnetic phase follow the benford s law more closely than in the antiferromagnetic phase , and therefore digit distributions of qd clearly identifies the quantum phases . on the contrary , concurrence and logarithmic negativity",
    "almost equally violate the benford s law in both the phases , although bvp can still detect the qpt present in the model .",
    "we finally analyze first significant digit distribution of different computable quantum correlation measures for multipartite as well as higher - dimensional systems .",
    "specifically , in a tripartite domain , the first - digit distribution of geometric measure of entanglement for the w - class states closely follow benford s law , while it is not the case for the ghz class , indicating another quantity of completely different root that can identify these two classes .",

    "<S> we show that the frequency distribution of the first significant digits of the numbers in the data sets generated from a large class of measures of quantum correlations , which are either entanglement measures , or belong to the information - theoretic paradigm , exhibit a universal behavior . in particular , for haar uniformly simulated arbitrary two - qubit states , we find that the first - digit distribution corresponding to a collection of chosen computable quantum correlation quantifiers tend to follow the first - digit law , known as the benford s law , when rank of the states increases . considering a two - qubit state which is obtained from a system governed by a specific hamiltonian  the anisotropic xy model with a transverse magnetic field  </S>",
    "<S> we see that entanglement as well as information theoretic measures violate the benford s law . </S>",
    "<S> however , interestingly , we find that among all the quantum correlation measures , quantum discord is the only measure which , like the transverse magnetization of the system , changes the pattern of the first - digit distribution depending on the quantum phases present in this model </S>",
    "<S> . we also comment on the universality of the statistics of first significant digits corresponding to appropriate measures of quantum correlations in the case of multipartite systems as well as systems in higher dimensions . </S>"
