    "there are four types of interactions in nature : gravitational , weak , electromagnetic and strong . in the study of elementary particles at high energy ,",
    "the gravitational interaction plays no known role .",
    "the other three interactions all proceed through the exchange of gauge particles .",
    "the gauge particle for the electromagnetic interaction is the best - known one : the photon , as first pointed out in one of the famous 1905 papers of einstein@xcite .",
    "while the photon does not interact with itself , all the other gauge particles have self - interactions , i.e.  they are all yang  mills particles@xcite .    the gauge particle for strong interactions  the gluon  is the second gauge particle , and the first yang ",
    "mills particle , to be observed experimentally anddirectly@xcite .",
    "this first observation was carried out in 1979 at desy , germany .",
    "four years later , the gauge particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 for weak interactions were observed at cern@xcite .",
    "some properties of these gauge particles are listed in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "all gauge particles have spin  1 .",
    "atoms and molecules are composed of protons , neutrons and electrons ; protons and neutrons are made of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 quarks of gell - mann@xcite and zweig@xcite.the @xmath2 , the @xmath3 , and the electron are all members of the first generation of quarks and leptons .",
    "there are three known generations of quarks and leptons ; some of their properties are listed in table  [ tab : quarks ] .",
    "thus there are six quarks and six leptons together with their antiparticles .",
    "all these quarks and leptons have spin  @xmath4 .",
    "the masses of the neutrinos are much smaller than that of the electron , which is the lightest lepton besides the neutrinos .",
    "experimentally , it is known that at least two of the three neutrinos ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) have nonzero mass ; it is generally accepted that all three neutrinos have nonzero masses .",
    "the interactions of these quarks and leptons are described by the standard model of glashow , weinberg and salam@xcite , which is a gauge theory with the group @xmath8 , where the gauge particles are those listed in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "it is an important feature of the standard model that the left - handed and the right - handed components of the quarks and leptons interact differently , according to the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 parts of the gauge group , respectively .",
    "this has far - reaching consequences .",
    "if a quark or a lepton has nonzero mass ( which is indeed the case as seen from table  [ tab : quarks ] ) , then the right - handed and the left - handed components can be transformed into each other through a lorentz transform .",
    "this important point can be seen more explicitly as follows .",
    "expressed in terms of the left - handed and the right - handed components , the mass term of an electron , for example , is @xmath11 & = & m_{e}\\bar{\\psi}_{el}\\psi_{er}+m_{e}\\bar{\\psi}_{er}\\psi_{el}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , in order to get a mass term for the electron , it is necessary to couple the left - handed and the right - handed components .",
    "but such a coupling is not allowed because these left - handed and right - handed components transform differently under a gauge transform .",
    "the basic idea proposed in 1964 is to introduce a new particle or field that has a nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "some of the early papers on this idea are listed as ref .  .",
    "in the context of the standard model , this new particle is commonly called the higgs particle .    for many years",
    ", this higgs particle had remained the only particle in the standard model not observed experimentally .",
    "it was finally discovered in the summer of 2012 by the atlas collaboration@xcite and the cms collaboration@xcite at cern using the proton ",
    "proton accelerator called the large hadron collider .",
    "it is the purpose of this review to give a brief history of the search and the discovery of this higgs particle .",
    "as already noted above , all the quarks and the leptons are spin-@xmath4 particles , while all the gauge particles have spin one .",
    "therefore , this newly discovered higgs particle not only completes the list of particles in the standard model , but is also the first elementary particle of spin zero .",
    "if one takes the view that this new class of spin-0 elementary particles consists not just of this higgs particle , then it is possible that this experimental discovery of the higgs particle may lead to an entirely new era of high - energy physics .        in particle physics , there is very little understanding of the masses of the various elementary particles .",
    "for example , even though the masses of the electron and the muon have both been measured to the accuracy of eight digits , there is no understanding why the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron . as another example",
    ", the mass of the top quark was not known until it was observed in fermilab@xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that there was no guess on the mass of the higgs particle even many years after it was proposed theoretically.@xcite        limited by the accelerators available at that time , the early searches , i.e.  the searches carried out in the 80s , are for the case of relatively low masses .",
    "the first excitement came from the crystal ball collaboration using the doris electron ",
    "positron collider at desy .",
    "they studied the decay @xmath12 and found a peak in the @xmath13 spectrum , corresponding to a higgs mass of 8.32  gev/@xmath14.@xcite this peak , reported at the 1984 international conference of high - energy physics in leipzig and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , has a high statistical significance of above @xmath15 .",
    "( a )  the cusb collaboration at cesr of cornell university continued to look for higgs particle in the upsilon decay @xmath16 , the same channel used by the crystal ball collaboration , but did not find a signal.@xcite                shortly after taking a leading role in the discovery of the gluon at desy , i decided to join the aleph collaboration at lep .",
    "my wisconsin group was the first us group invited to join the aleph experiment .",
    "the main reason for this move to cern was my desire to concentrate on discovering experimentally the higgs particle , but i did not realize at that time this quest was going to take 32  years , from 1980 to 2012 !      the operation of lep can be described in terms of two periods , designated as lep1 and lep2 . the strategies to search for the higgs particle are quite different , and are to be described in secs .",

    "thus the event rate was very high .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath1 mass is much larger than those of the particles used to search for the higgs particle as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : earlysearch ] , lep1 provided a significantly larger range for the higgs mass .      at this @xmath1 peak , the most useful decay channels for the search of the higgs particle are through @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 means as usual either the electron or the muon , as shown in fig .",

''",
    "reference   gives a partial list of the publications for the search for the higgs particle on the basis of the data from lep1 .",
    "due to the difficulties of combining the searches from four experiments , very roughly the data from lep1 excludes the mass of the higgs particle to be below 65  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "for lep2 , the center - of - mass energy went beyond the @xmath1 peak , much beyond .",

    "this lhc is a remarkable accelerator : since the previous highest energy of 1.96  tev was from the tevatron collider of fermilab , the initial energy of the lhc was an increase of more than 3.5 times .",

    "[ lep1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the corresponding situation at the large hadron collider is more complicated .    in an event at lep , almost all the particles in the final state",
    "are seen in the detector , the major exception being the neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , in almost any event at lhc with particle production , most of the particles in the final state are not seen in the detector . in particular , many of them go down the beam pipes and are not detected . as an example",
    ", the exclusive production process @xmath50 has a tiny detectable cross section .",
    "for this reason , at the large hadron collider , initially only inclusive production cross sections are of interest , at least for the higgs particle .    to a good approximation ,",
    "a proton consists of two @xmath2 quarks , one @xmath3 quark , and a number of gluons , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "since the coupling of the higgs particle to an elementary particle is proportional to its mass , there is little coupling between the higgs particle and these constituents of the proton .",
    "instead , some heavy particle first needs to be produced in a proton ",
    "proton collision at the lhc , and then is used to couple to the higgs .    from tables  [ tab : properties ] and [ tab : quarks ] , the heaviest known elementary particles are @xmath51 in descending order according to their masses . in this section ,",
    "we consider the case of the @xmath52 , the top quark .",

    "as discussed in the preceding paragraph , there is no photon , or @xmath1 , or @xmath0 as a constituent of the proton .",
    "since , on the other hand , there are gluons in the proton , ( d ) is by far the most important production process for the top quark , the heaviest known elementary particle .    because of color conservation  the gluon has color but not the higgs particle",
    " the top and anti - top pair produced by a gluon can not annihilate into a higgs particle . in order for this annihilation into a higgs particle to occur , it is necessary for the top or the anti - top quark to interact with a second gluon to change its color content .",
    "it is therefore necessary to involve two gluons , one each from the protons of the two opposing beams , and we are led to the following diagram for higgs production :        this production process is called `` gluon gluon fusion '' ( also called `` gluon fusion '' ) .",
    "as expected from the large mass of the top quark , this gluon gluon fusion is by far the most important higgs production process , and shows the central role played by the gluon@xcite in the discovery of the higgs particle in 2012 .",
    "it is desirable to make this statement more quantitative .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ ver2 ] the various higgs production cross sections from calculation as functions of the higgs mass.@xcite the top curve is for gluon gluon fusion , and next one is for vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ; note that the vertical scale is logarithmic .",
    "the other three curves are for associated production processes to be described in the next section .        in order to show even more clearly the importance of gluon gluon fusion , fig .",
    "[ ver3 ] shows the ratio of the second most important production process vbf to gluon gluon fusion .",
    "it is seen that , for the relatively low masses of the higgs particle , vbf cross section is less than 10% of that of gluon gluon fusion .",
    "it will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discovery ] that the higgs particle discovered experimentally indeed has a mass in this range .",
    "thus , through gluon gluon fusion , the gluon contributes about 90% of higgs production at the large hadron collider . a more dramatic way of saying the same thing is that , if there were no gluon , the higgs particle could not have been discovered for many years !          as discussed in the preceding section , there is essentially only one way , the gluon gluon fusion , to produce the higgs particle through its coupling to the top quark , the other contributions being much smaller .",
    "[ see , however , the comments on associated production below . ]",
    "let us consider here the alternative possibilities through the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 instead of the top quark .",
    "note , from tables  [ tab : properties ] and [ tab : quarks ] , that the mass of the @xmath1 is slightly more than , while that of the @xmath0 slightly less than , half of the top - quark mass .    neither the @xmath1 nor the @xmath0 has color , meaning that they do not couple to the gluon .",
    "thus the production of the higgs particle through @xmath60 is quite different from the case of sec .",
    "[ sec : gluon ] . instead , a major process is the so - called `` vector boson fusion '' ( vbf ) where a quark from one of the incoming protons emits a @xmath1 or a @xmath61 while another quark from the other incoming protons provides a @xmath1 or a @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 pair or the @xmath64 pair then `` fuses '' to produce the higgs particle .",
    "the diagram for vbf is shown in fig .",
    "[ ver4 ] .        as shown in figs .",
    "[ ver2 ] and [ ver3 ] , the total cross section for vbf is significantly smaller than that for gluon gluon fusion , which is the major production process for the higgs particle .",
    "if it is desired to determine experimentally the contribution from vbf , use is made of the presence of the two quarks in the final state : each quark is seen in the detector as a _",
    "jet_. therefore , the higgs particle from vbf can be seen in the detector as together with no _ jet _ , one _ jet _ , or two _",
    "jets_.    a higgs particle produced together with one _ jet _ or two _ jets _ is an example of associated production .",
    "three other examples of associated production are shown in fig .",
    "[ ver5 ] . that of fig .",
    "[ ver5](a ) shows higgs production in association with a @xmath0 or a @xmath1 ; these processes are very similar to that of lep in fig .",

    "antiquark pair .",
    "similarly , that of fig .",
    "[ ver5](b ) shows higgs production in association with a top ",
    "antitop pair .",
    "this is similar to gluon gluon fusion except that top loop is opened up ; since the top quark is heavy ( which is the original reason why it is desirable to use the top to produce the higgs ) the presence of one top quark and one anti - top quark in the final state reduces the production cross section for that of fig .",
    "[ ver5](b ) .",
    "all these production processes shown in figs .  [ ver4 ] and  [ ver5 ] lead to higgs production cross sections significantly smaller than that of gluon gluon fusion of fig .",
    "[ ver1 ] , the reason having already been given in the preceding section .",
    "for the higgs search , there are several important and potentially useful decay modes .",
    "it has turned out that the most important decay mode is @xmath65 .",
    "this decay mode was fundamental in the design of the atlas and cms detectors.@xcite in the standard model , this decay @xmath65 proceeds predominantly through one - loop diagrams in the @xmath0 and the top quark , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for the @xmath0",
    ", there is an additional diagram with a @xmath66 vertex .",
    "experimentally , this decay process has the advantage of relatively less background since the final state contains only photons .",
    "furthermore , because of the good energy measurement for photons with the atlas and the cms detectors , this decay gives a good mass determination for the higgs particle .",
    "this is shorthand for the decay sequence @xmath68 followed by@xmath69for both @xmath1 s , where @xmath26 denotes either an electron or a muon .",
    "thus the final state consists of four charged leptons : @xmath70 , @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "when the higgs mass is less than twice the @xmath1 mass , one or both of the @xmath1 s must be virtual . this channel is often referred to as the golden channel , because the final state consists of four charged leptons .",
    "not only the momentum of each of the particles in the final state is easy to measure accurately , but also the background is under control .",
    "the two processes @xmath65 and @xmath74 @xmath75 , described in secs .",
    "[ sec : htogg ] and [ sec : htozz ] above , are referred to as decay processes with high mass resolution .",
    "this designation means that every one of the decay products can be measured accurately , and hence the mass of the higgs particle can be well determined event by event .",
    "in contrast , the decay mode to be considered here is : @xmath76 followed by either : + both @xmath0 s decay leptonically , + orone of the @xmath0 s decay leptonically while the other decays hadronically .",
    "it has not been possible to analyze the channel where both @xmath0 s decay hadronically , the reason being that the qcd background is too high .",
    "when at least one of the two @xmath0 s decays leptonically as indicated above , there is either one or two neutrinos in the decay product , making it impossible to determine the mass of the higgs particle event by event .",
    "for this reason , this decay mode being considered here is referred to as a decay process with low mass resolution .    for some time",
    ", it was believed that this @xmath77 decay mode gave the best chance of discovering the higgs particle because of its relatively large branching ratio .",
