    "one of the most intriguing astrophysical objects are the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) discovered around nearby galaxies by the x - ray satellites _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ and _ xmm ",
    "newton_. assuming that they are at the same distance as the galaxies that are apparently close to them on the sky , their luminosities in the 0.12.4 kev x - ray band are in the range @xmath0@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , so that they are too luminous to be x - ray cataclysmic binary stars ( pakull & mirioni 2002 ) and too faint to be compared with the typical luminosities of active galactic nuclei .",
    "although much remains to be clarified , several explanations concerning the nature of these objects in terms of globular clusters , hii regions , etc .",
    "( pakull & mirioni 2002 ; angelini , loewenstein & mushotzky 2001 ; gao et al .",
    "2003 ; roberts , goad , & warwick 2003 ; wang 2002 ) , or of hypothetical supermassive stars or beamed emission ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; krding , falcke , & markoff 2002 ) have been proposed .",
    "studies with _ xmm  newton _ ( jenkins et al .",
    "2004 ) point to a heterogeneus class of objects whose spectral properties are similar to those of objects with lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "a catalogue of ulxs around bright nearby galaxies has been compiled ( colbert & ptak 2002 , cp02 hereafter ) by cross - correlating public archive _ rosat _ hri images with a selection of nearby ( @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ) galaxies taken from the rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the catalogue of ulxs ( or ixos , intermediate x - ray objects , in the notation of cp02 ) comprises 87 objects around 54 bright nearby galaxies . according to the analysis of the cp02 catalogue made by irwin , bregman & athey ( 2004 ) ulxs with luminosities below @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 can be explained naturally by accretion on to black holes with masses @xmath520@xmath6 .",
    "the analysis of objects with higher x - ray luminosities has revealed that only for parent galaxies of late types is the distribution of objects concentrated towards the galactic centre . also , according to the analysis of these authors , the number of ulxs is smaller in early type parent galaxies and compatible with the expected number of foreground / background sources , while the number of ulxs around late - type galaxies is larger and requires the existence of a new class of objects within the parent galaxy .",
    "the contamination of background objects obviously increases with distance to the parent galaxy ; in fact ptak & colbert ( 2004 ) have claimed that most of the ulxs listed in the cp02 catalogue at distances from the assumed parent galaxy @xmath7 are probably background objects .",
    "these considerations on the nature of ulxs are based on indirect statistical evidence .",
    "the confirmation of this evidence with the identification of counterparts in other bands is essential .",
    "the number of such optical identifications is still small ( e.g.  roberts et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al .  2002 ; maseti et al .  2003",
    "; liu , bregman & seitzer 2004 ) and is usually restricted to single galaxies , making statistical studies very difficult .",
    "the study presented here includes sources in several galaxies and allows one of the first identifications based on unambiguous spectral features in the optical .",
    "we have looked for these counterparts of the ulx sources listed in the cp02 catalogue in the digital sky survey ( dss ) images and in the digitalized usno catalogues .",
    "the typical magnitudes of such objects are 1820 mag in the @xmath8 band and are therefore bright enough targets for spectroscopic observations with 2 to 4 m telescopes . previously we have presented ( arp , gutirrez & lpez - corredoira 2004 ) an analysis of the first three objects observed ; two of them ( ixo  1 and 2 ) , close to the galaxy ngc  720 , resulted in quasars at much higher redshift ( 0.959 and 2.216 respectively ) than the parent galaxy . given the paucity of quasars in the sky , a misidentification is unlikely .",
    "the third one ( ixo  5 ) was associated with an hii region at the redshift of the parent galaxy ( ngc  1073 ) .",
    "this last object was at the edge of a spiral arm of the parent galaxy , where there are many hii regions .",
    "if the identification is correct , these would confirm previous findings ( gao et al .",
    "2003 ) claiming that many of the x - ray sources around the cartwheel galaxy are associated with hii regions . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of new observations of six other cases , all of which also turn out to be quasars at higher redshift than their parent galaxies .",
    "we took spectroscopy in january 2004 for the optical counterparts of sources ( following the notation of the cp02 catalogue ) ixo  33 , 45 , 58 , 69 , 71 and 84 .",
    "the observations were conducted at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) .",
    "we used the red arm of the isis spectrograph with the r158r grism .",
    "the slit width was between 1.20 and 1.45 arcsec .",
    "we used cu  ar and cu  ne lamps for wavelength calibration .",
    "this provides a sampling of 1.62  pixel@xmath2 and an effective resolution of 810   ( depending on the slit width used and atmospheric seeing ) .",
    "a single image with an exposure time of 1800 s was taken for each object .",
    "the spectra were analysed following a standard procedure using iraf that comprises bias subtraction , extraction of the spectra and wavelength calibration .",
    "we used the standard spectroscopic stars feige  67 ( oke 1990 ) , and bd+26 2606 ( oke & gunn 1983 ) to correct approximately for the response of the configuration to different wavelengths . given the prohibitive time needed to obtain flat - field images ( especially in the blue part of the spectrum ) , we did not correct for that effect .",
    "however , we have checked that this correction would have been very small ( @xmath9 % ) and would not have affected any of the identifications of the main spectral features reported here .",
    "figure  1 shows the dss images with the identification of the optical counterpart .",
    "figure  2 presents the spectra taken for these objects .",
    "spectra of four of the objects ( ixo  45 , 58 , 69 and 71 ) are rather flat while the other two ( ixo  33 and 84 ) rise slightly towards red wavelengths .",
    "the main lines in the spectra of objects ixo  33 and 71 are wide balmer lines ( h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 ) and narrow forbidden oii ( @xmath12  ) and oiii ( @xmath13  ) lines , while the spectra of the other four ( objects ixo  45 , 58 , 69 and 84 ) are dominated by the wide emission line of mg ii ( 2798  ) .",
    "all these features are characteristic of quasar spectra .",
    "the position of the main emission lines allows unambigous determination of the redshifts of the objects .",
    "the uncertainties in the determination of redshift are @xmath140.001 for objects in which we detect the mgii lines and @xmath140.0002 for the rest .",
    "table  1 presents a summary of the main properties of the objects and the estimated redshifts .    * other objects in the slit *    in three of the cases ( ixo  33 , 58 and 84 ) there is more than one object in the dss very close to the main object and whose position is marginally compatible with that of the x - ray source .",
    "in all these cases we positioned the slit crossing these objects also .",
    "these are :    * second object near ixo  33 : this object , not listed in the usno catalogue , is nevertheless visible in the dss plates .",
    "it is at a distance @xmath15 arcsec from the main object .",
    "the spectra has absorption features typical of a local cold star . *",
    "second object near ixo  58 : according to the usno catalogue , this object has 18.8 and 18.5 mag in @xmath8 and @xmath16 bands respectively and is at a distance of @xmath1414 arcsec from the main object .",
    "we have identified weak balmer h@xmath17 , h@xmath18 , h@xmath11 and h@xmath10 lines at z=0.317 in its continuum , which has no strong features .",
    "we tentatively identify the spectra as a bl lac type object .",
    "* objects near ixo  84 : an object at @xmath1418 arcsec from the main one has a very weak continuum in which we detect a narrow emission line at 6843  , which we were unable to identify . by chance , the slit also crosses another object at a distance of @xmath1464 arcsec from the main object .",
    "it has a spectum typical of an hii region resulting a redshift of @xmath19 .",
    "the object is extended and , given its redshift and its location near an arm of the galaxy ngc  5774 , it seems to be an hii region of this galaxy .",
    "in the following analysis we also include the three objects ixo  1 , 2 and 5 that were observed with the same set - up and presented in arp et al .",
    "the ulxs analysed here have x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath1416@xmath20 erg s@xmath2 ( assuming that the x - ray sources are at the distance of the putative parent galaxy ) and are at projected distances in the range @xmath140.71.9@xmath21 from the centre of such galaxiex , six of them in elliptical galaxies and three in spirals .",
    "all except for one ( ixo  5 ) turn out to be quasars at higher redshift than the assumed parent galaxy .",
    "these results extend the findings of foschini et al .  ( 2002 ) and maseti et al .  ( 2003 ) , who also found optical counterparts of ulxs at a higher redshift than that of the assigned host galaxy , and that other objects obeying the observational criteria used to define ulxs were not included in the cp02 compilation because they were previously known high redshift quasars ( see the discussion on this in arp et al .",
    "because our targets were selected among those visible in the dss , it should be reasonable to deduce that an important fraction ( the majority in the case of early - type parent galaxies ) of the ulx sources with optical counterparts in the range @xmath141820 mag must also be quasars .",
    "the only object that has a redshift similar to that of the assigned parent galaxy is ixo  5 , which is in a star forming region of the spiral galaxy ngc  1073 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with the statistics of quasars in the field .",
    "this analysis is difficult because of the characteristics in terms of completeness , coverage , etc .",
    ", of the cp02 catalogue and the small size of our sample",
    ". a simplistic and rough calculation can be made by considering the optical magnitudes of the quasars detected , and the area surveyed by cp02 .",
    "the total area enclosed in a circle centred on the parent galaxy and enclosing the ulxs found in our sample is @xmath14500 square arcmin . according to the study by ptak & colbert ( 2004 ) only @xmath1410 % of the rc3 galaxies observed with hri have at least one ulx , so that the total area surveyed in which the quasars have been found is @xmath141.5 square degrees . from the 2df quasar survey ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) and the fit presented by lpez - corredoira & gutirrez ( 2004 ) to the boyle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) data , there are about 0.2 , 3 , and 17 quasars per square degree brighter than 18 , 19 and 20 mag , respectively , in the @xmath8 band .",
    "so , in principle , the inferred distribution of quasars from our measurements is roughly in agreement with expectations for a purely random distribution of background quasars .",
    "this would confirm the statistical analysis by irwin et al.(2004 ) and ptak & colbert ( 2004 ) , who claimed that the distribution of ulxs around early - type galaxies is compatible with expectations from the background population of objects .",
    "however , an accurate assesment of this would require a direct comparison with the density of x - ray selected background quasars . in any case",
    ", searching for optical counterparts of ulxs and taking their spectra seems to be one of the most promising and unambiguous methods of unravelling the true nature of such objects .",
