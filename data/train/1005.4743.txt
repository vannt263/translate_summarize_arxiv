    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theories ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite has provided a theoretical framework to describe the strongly coupled conformal field theories through a weakly coupled dual gravitational description . recently stimulated from this correspondence , a remarkable connection between the condensed matter and the gravitational physics has been discovered , for reviews see @xcite .",

    "they found that a generalized stckelberg mechanism of symmetry breaking allows for a description of a wider class of phase transitions .",
    "this framework allows tuning the order of the phase transition which can accommodate the first order phase transition to occur , and for the second order phase transition it allows tuning the values of critical exponents @xcite .",
    "an interesting extension was done in @xcite by constructing general models for holographic superconductivity .",
    "it was found that except some universal model independent features , some important aspects of the quantum critical behavior strongly depend on the choice of couplings , such as the order of the phase transition and critical exponents of second - order phase transitions .",

    "it is of great interest to generalize the investigation on the phase transition in the holographic superconductor to the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
