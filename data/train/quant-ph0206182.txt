    "the rabi hamiltonian ( rh ) , introduced by rabi in 1937 @xcite , has long served as a popular and successful model of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the hamiltonian provides a description of an atom approximated by a two - level system interacting via a dipole interaction with a single mode of radiation @xcite .",
    "typically , this hamiltonian is studied within the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , which results in the well - known jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite .",
    "the jcm is exactly integrable , whereas the full rh is not .",
    "the two - photon rabi hamiltonian ( tprh ) is an obvious extension of the original rh , where the atomic transitions are induced by the absorption and emission of two photons rather than one .",
    "such non - linear optical processes have been of considerable interest [ 4 ] , with applications including two - photon lasers and two - photon optical bistability [ 5 ] .",
    "the tprh is not known to be integrable , whereas its rwa counterpart is , as has been demonstrated by sukumar and buck [ 6 ] and compagno and persico [ 7 ] .",
    "it should be noted from the outset that the tprh , and its rwa variant , are phenomenological hamiltonians , in that they neglect the effects of intensity - dependent stark shifts of the atomic levels @xcite .",
    "nevertheless they do provide useful prototypes of two - photon interactions @xcite , and their similarity with the rh and its rwa variant allows fruitful comparisons to be made @xcite .",
    "the tprh has been of considerable theoretical interest due to the connection of the two - photon interaction to the group @xmath0 and to the squeezed states @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the observation of two - photon rabi oscillations in experiments with rydberg atoms @xcite has also contributed to the interest in this type of model .",
    "comparatively little attention has focused on the tprh without the rwa .",
    "a notable exception to this is the work of ng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who have used numerical diagonalisation in a truncated basis to investigate the spectrum and simple dynamics of the system .",
    "their analysis indicates that the spectrum of the full hamiltonian is significantly different to the rwa spectrum , and that making the rwa also alters appreciably the dynamics .",
    "these results fit in well with other work regarding the rwa , which suggest that the consequences of making this approximation may be greater than usually thought @xcite . here",
    "we shall exclusively consider the full hamiltonian without the rwa .    in this communication",
    "we discuss a number of exact results for the tprh without the rwa .",
    "after introducing the hamiltonian and examining its connection to the group @xmath0 , we consider the limit of the hamiltonian in which the atomic levels become degenerate . in",
    "so doing we obtain a condition on the range of atom - field couplings for which this model remains mathematically valid .",
    "we then proceed to obtain a set of isolated , exact solutions for the hamiltonian .",
    "their counterparts are well known for the single - photon rh , where they are referred to as juddian solutions @xcite .",
    "such solutions tell us a great deal about the structure and symmetries of this type of non - adiabatic model .",
    "they may also serve as benchmarks for numerical techniques and as foundations for perturbative treatments .",
    "furthermore , the existence of isolated exact solutions in non - integrable quantum models is also of interest from the perspective of studying possible quantum chaos in such systems @xcite . in determining these solutions for the tprh we shall utilise an appropriate bogoliubov transformation of the field mode , an approach outlined by the present authors in a previous publication @xcite , to be referred to as * i * hereafter .",
    "the tprh describes the interaction of a two - level atom with a single bosonic field mode via a two - photon interaction .",
    "the field is described by the annihilation and creation operators , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , which obey the usual commutation relation , @xmath3 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the two - level atom is described by the pauli pseudo - spin operators @xmath4 , which satisfy the @xmath5 commutation relations , @xmath6=   2 i\\sigma_z$ ] , plus cyclic permutations .",
    "we define the raising and lowering operators as @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    in terms of these operators ,",
    "the tprh is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic level splitting , @xmath11 is the frequency of the boson mode and @xmath12 is the coupling strength of the atom to the field . note that here we have the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 inducing atomic transitions , instead of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , as we would have in the single - photon rh .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the hamiltonian as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the tprh is not known to be integrable .",
    "like the single - photon rh , the tprh possesses a conserved quantum number , which in the present case is @xmath19 , namely an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath20 \\\\               & = & - \\sigma_z \\exp\\left [ \\frac{i\\pi}{2 } b^\\dagger b \\right ] .",
    "\\label{tppi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is simple to show that @xmath21=0 $ ] .",
    "the operator @xmath22 is the square root of the elementary parity operator @xmath23 , and has been denoted as the fourier operator .",
    "its role in squeezing has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .    as the level - flip in the tprh",
    "is induced by two photons , the condition for the system to be on resonance is @xmath24 , or alternatively that @xmath25 .",
    "the tprh contains only quadratic combinations of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "consequently , we may write the hamiltonian in terms of the three operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are defined as @xmath29 these operators form a closed lie algebra @xmath30 , defined by the commutator relations @xmath31=\\pm k_\\pm,~~\\left[k_-,k_+\\right]=2k_0.\\ ] ] the corresponding invariant casimir operator @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 which commutes with all three generators . for our purposes here , we shall use a unitary irreducible representation of this algebra known as the positive discrete series @xmath34 @xcite . in this representation",

    "the action of the casimir operator in this representation is @xmath39 the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 are hermitian conjugate to each other and act as raising and lowering operators respectively within @xmath34 , @xmath40 for the single - mode bosonic realisation of @xmath0 that we require here , the bargmann index @xmath41 is equal to either @xmath42 or @xmath43 . in terms of the original bose operators the states @xmath44",
    "are given equivalently as @xmath45 so by switching to a @xmath0 representation we explicitly acknowledge that we are splitting the hilbert space of the boson field into two independent subspaces .",
    "each subspace is labeled by the bargmann index @xmath46 and only contains either all even ( @xmath47 ) or all odd ( @xmath48 ) number states .",
    "it is interesting to note in passing that the algebra @xmath0 may also be used to describe a system of two bosonic modes , which interact in such a way as to preserve the total particle number @xcite    in terms of the @xmath0 generators , the tprh can be written @xmath49 with the rescaled hamiltonian being given by @xmath50      the relationship between the group @xmath0 and squeezing has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite and the use of squeezed states in finding exact isolated solutions has been previously discussed in * i*. here we simply note that the general squeezing operator @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are squeezing parameters , with @xmath54 real and @xmath53 a complex number with modulus @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath51 is a unitary operator , @xmath56 , and provides a representation of the group @xmath0 . with it",
    "we may make unitary transformations of the bosonic annihilation and creation operators , such that @xmath57 the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath60=1 $ ] , and are henceforth referred to as squeezed boson operators .",
    "for degenerate atomic levels , @xmath61 , the ( rescaled ) tprh takes the form @xmath62 consequently eigenstates of @xmath63 are also eigenstates of @xmath64 , and we are led to consider the bosonic hamiltonian , @xmath65 where the two signs correspond to the two eigenvalues of @xmath64 .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ tpmhom0 ] ) has the form of a squeezed harmonic oscillator . in seeking its eigen - solutions , it is convenient to use the squeezed bosons discussed above .    inverting the relations ( [ sqcdefn ] ) , setting @xmath54 to zero and constraining @xmath53 to be real , we obtain the following forms for the squeezed bosonic operators @xmath66 where the subscript on these operators corresponds to the sign in eq .",

    "the eigenfunctions of the bosonic part of the @xmath76 hamiltonian are number states of the squeezed bosons . the squeezed vacuum , @xmath77 , is proportional to @xmath78 and this state is only normalisable for @xmath79 , which corresponds to the conditions @xmath80 above this value of @xmath81 the @xmath76 hamiltonian does not possess normalisable eigenfunctions and is thus unphysical . as has been discussed by ng _",
    "@xcite , and as is borne out by numerical diagonalisation @xcite , this analysis still holds for the @xmath82 case as the remaining operator in the hamiltonian , @xmath83 , is clearly a bounded operator @xcite , and thus presents no problems .",
    "thus we see that the tprh is only well defined for values of @xmath84 .",
    "this restriction on the coupling is not a severe restriction as , at higher couplings , effects not included in this model , such as the contributions of off - resonant , one - photon processes , will come into play , thereby compromising the physical relevance of the model .",
    "we now demonstrate the existence of a class of isolated , exact solutions for the tprh , similar to the juddian solutions found for the one - photon rh .",
    "following * i * we seek solutions by first performing a bogoliubov transformation of the field mode .",

    "[ 2pjuddfig1 ] , the juddian solutions found by this method occur at level - crossings in the energy schema , but that they do not cover every crossing , as is the case with the one - photon hamiltonian . considering the quantum numbers @xmath19 of the two intersecting lines at each crossing , we see that the above type of solution can only describe the crossings of states having @xmath148 with ones having @xmath149 , and of crossings of states having @xmath150 with ones having @xmath151",
    ". the remaining four types of possible crossings are not described .",
    "this situation is summarised in table [ 2pjxings ] .",
    "this series of crossings can be understood by considering the parity operator @xmath152 @xmath153 which obviously commutes with the hamiltonian . from considering the eigenvalues of this operator",
    "we see that the juddian solutions we have described occur between levels which have the same value of @xmath152 . thus although the anstze of the juddian solutions above are not eigenstates of the fourier - like operator @xmath154 , they are eigenstates of parity .    these crossings can be viewed in another way .",
    "ng _ et al . _ have introduced a unitary transformation which decouples the spin and bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "after the application of this transformation , the bosonic part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath155 where the numbers @xmath156 , corresponding to the spin degree of freedom , and @xmath157 , corresponding to the bargmann index , serve to characterize the four independent sub - spaces into which the full hilbert space of the hamiltonian decomposes under this transformation .",
    "we thus see that the crossings detailed above occur between states with the same bargmann @xmath41 index , but with different @xmath158 indices .",
    "by contrast the missing crossings occur between states with different values of @xmath41 .",
    "the reason why the above anstze can describe these solutions and not the others is as follows .",
    "the solutions that we have been able to find occur at crossings between energy eigenfunctions that both have the same bargmann index @xmath41 , which means that both states are composed of either all even or all odd number states . at",
    "the juddian points these two eigenstates become degenerate in energy and thus , to find the energy at the level - crossing we may form a linear superposition of the two eigenstates , which will , in general , not be an eigen - state of @xmath152 . because the degenerate energy eigenstates belong to the same @xmath41-sector , the formation of the superposition allows the individual terms in one wavefunction to add to the terms in the other .",
    "if we form the superposition correctly , the resultant wavefunction may have a form much simpler than the constituent wavefunctions .",
    "this is exactly the case when we choose the ansatz ( [ 2pjsansatz ] ) .",
    "the solutions that we have been unable to find with the above method occur at the level - crossings between energy eigenstates that have different bargmann indices .",
    "this means that one eigenstate is composed of odd number states , whilst the other is composed only of even number states .",
    "consequently , no superposition of these states will lead to a reduction in the complexity of either wavefunction and we have been unable to find simple anstze at these level - crossings .",
    "although the above method is not directly extensible to the remaining crossings , it may still be the case that exact solutions can be found .",
    "although there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that these exact solutions exist , by looking at the energy schema generated numerically , we observe that the remaining level - crossings appear to lie along base - lines described by @xmath159 where , as previously , @xmath160 .",
    "these baselines are so similar to the baselines for the juddian solutions found above that it would seem likely that juddian solutions could also be found at these remaining crossings .",
    "we have shown that a set of isolated , exact solutions exists for the two - photon rabi hamiltonian .",
    "these are seen to occur at a sub  set of the level - crossings in the energy schema and although we have not described every level crossing , we have been able to explain this in terms of the symmetry properties of the crossing states .",
    "this type of isolated solution also occurs in the single - photon rabi hamiltonian , where they are referred to as juddian solutions .",
    "several methods have been proposed for finding these solutions @xcite . in * i * we have given a method for finding these solutions that is directly analogous to the one used here , except that for the one - photon case we have used displaced , rather than squeezed , bosons . in this case , the ansatz does provide solutions at every level - crossing in the spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that the single - photon hamiltonian is a simpler model than the tprh , as the conserved quantum number analogous to @xmath19 only has two eigenvalues , and thus there is only one type of level crossing , whereas in the current model @xmath161 has four eigenvalues and there are six different types of crossing .",
    "it is hoped that the results presented here , in conjunction with those in * i * , will be of use in the analysis of this kind of non - adiabatic model .",
    "these isolated solutions seem an ideal starting point for the analysis of this kind of situation , since they provide exact results which may be used as bench - marks for further methods .",
    "they also provide crucial insight into the symmetries of the model .",

    "<S> the two - photon rabi hamiltonian is a simple model describing the interaction of light with matter , with the interaction being mediated by the exchange of two photons . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that , despite this non - integrability , there exist isolated , exact solutions for this model analogous to the so - called juddian solutions found for the single - photon rabi hamiltonian . in so doing we use a bogoliubov transformation of the field mode , as described by the present authors in an earlier publication .    </S>",
