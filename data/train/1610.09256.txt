    "dense small cell networks ( scns ) hold the promise to rapidly increase the network capacity for the fifth generation ( 5 g ) of cellular communications  @xcite by deploying base stations ( bss ) much closer to user equipments ( ues ) and reusing the spectrum intensively  @xcite .",
    "however , the small distances between transmitters and receivers also bring a change in the channel characteristics , which in turn may significantly impact the network performance .",
    "for example , the channel may become line - of - sight ( los ) dominated with the smaller distances between bss and ues , with the subsequent loss of channel diversity .",
    "unfortunately , most of the previous theoretical studies on dense scns have neglected these facts , and do not capture these important channel properties .",
    "some works for instance do not consider the probability of line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "instead , they use path loss models that do not differentiate between los and non - los ( nlos ) transmissions , and other simplifications , which may have led to misleading conclusions , or conclusions that do not apply to the full spectrum of bs densities , e.g. , the coverage probability is independent of the number of deployed small cell bss in interference - limited fully - loaded cellular networks , and/or the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) will linearly increase with network densification  @xcite .",
    "the question now is whether such simplifications have a significant impact on network performance , and whether those conclusions still hold and when . to address the question with regard to the probability of los ,",
    "the authors in  @xcite have studied the impact of the aforementioned issue using a path loss model that incorporates both los and nlos transmissions in dense scns . however ,",
    "rayleigh fading was used for both components , which is not accurate , as the fading in los transmissions are well known to be non - rayleigh distributed . despite of such simplification , the authors showed that , as the density of small cells increases , the ase will initially increase .",
    "however , as the density of small cells exceeds a specific threshold , the coverage probability will decrease due to the transition of a large number of interfering signals from nlos transmission to los transmission , and as a consequent the ase may either continue to grow but at a much slower pace or even decrease .",
    "in other words , due to such transition , the interference power will increase faster than the signal power for some bs densities , which negatively affects the user s signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) , and verifies that the density of small cell bss may have a key impact on network performance .",
    "however , in terms of multi - path fading and as mentioned before , it is important to note that the authors in  @xcite oversimplified the los link assuming rayleigh fading .",
    "an interesting question is whether a more accurate multi - path fading channel model will change the conclusions in  @xcite , which already changed the conclusions in  @xcite , and whether the multi - path fading can mitigate or exacerbate the issues brought by the nlos to los transition .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a rician fading based channel model , which is a more appropriate fading model for dense scns , especially for los paths .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    * we derive the analytical results for the coverage probability as well as the ase of a dense scn under a rician fading channel using a general path loss model incorporating both los and nlos transmissions .",
    "* moreover , we obtain integral - form expressions for the coverage probability and the ase using a 3gpp path loss model with a _ linear _ los probability function .",
    "note that studying the linear los probability function not only allows us to obtain more tractable results , but also help us to deal with more complicated path loss models in practice , as they can be approximated by piece - wise linear functions . *",
    "our theoretical analysis reveals an important finding , i.e. , due to the dominance of paths loss in dense scns , the impact of the multi - path fading is negligible and thus when the density of small cell bss exceeds a certain threshold , the network coverage probability will decrease as small cells become denser , the rician multi - path fading does not help to mitigate this phenomena .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : system - model ] , the system model is presented . in section  [ sec : general - results ] , the main analytical results on the coverage probability and the ase taking into account the rician fading channel are discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : simulation - and - discussion ] , the numerical results are presented .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , the conclusions are drawn .",

    "we assume that small cell bss form a homogeneous poisson point process ( hppp ) @xmath0 of intensity @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that ues form another stationary hppp with an intensity of @xmath3 @xmath4 , which is independent from the small cell bss distribution .",
    "note that @xmath3 is considered to be sufficiently larger than @xmath1 so that each bs has at least one associated ue in its coverage .",
    "we also assume that a typical ue is located at the origin , which is a common assumption in the analysis using stochastic geometry .",
    "we denote the distance between an arbitrary bs and the typical ue by @xmath5 in km . considering practical los / nlos transmissions ,",
    "we propose to model the path loss with respect to distance @xmath5 as shown in ( [ eq : prop_pl_model ] ) .",

    "first , it is important to note that the theoretical analysis results match well with the simulation results , and hence we only show theoretical results in the sequel . fig .",
    "[ fig : p_cov ] shows that the probability of coverage in the case of ricean fading follows the same trend as in the case of rayleigh fading presented in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the probability of coverage initially increases as the bs density increases .",
    "however , once the bs density exceeds a certain threshold , i.e. , @xmath120 @xmath121 , the probability of coverage starts to decline .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "when the bs density is lower than @xmath122 , the network behaviour is noise limited and thus there is a rapid increase in coverage probability with the bs density .",
    "however , once the network becomes denser and the density of bss is larger than @xmath122 , then a large number of interfering signals transit from nlos to los , and hence the increase in interference power can not be counterbalanced by the increase in signal power , which was already los .",
    "note that further densification beyond @xmath122 results in slower decline rate in coverage probability , since both signals corresponding to interfering and serving bss are los dominated .    comparing the probability of coverage results in this paper with rician fading with those in  @xcite with rayleigh fading as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_cov_comp ] , it can be concluded that the impact of rician fading on the probability of coverage is negligible .",
    "the difference in coverage probability is less than 0.02 for all bs densities .",
    "this is because the nlos to los transition is in the order of 15 - 20 db according to the 3gpp path loss functions @xcite , while that of rayleigh to rician is in the order of @xmath123 3 db .",
    "hence , rayleigh or rician fading makes little difference against this abrupt change of interference strength .",
    "[ fig : ase ] shows the ase for different sinr thresholds of @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "note that the ase results are derived based on the results from the probability of coverage presented in ( [ eq : ase_def ] ) .",
    "similar to the observed trend for the probability of coverage , the ase trend also shows three phases . in the first phase , when the bs density is lower than @xmath122 , the ase increases with the bs density as coverage holes are mitigated . in the second phase , when the bs density exceeds @xmath122 , the ase suffers from a slower growth pace or even a decrease due to the decline in probability of coverage originated by the transition of a large number of interfering signals transit from nlos to los . in the third phase ,",
    "when all interfering signals has transited to los , the ase starts to linearly increase with bs density since the network has become statistically stable with all interfering and serving bss being los dominated .    comparing the ase results in this paper with rician fading with those in  @xcite with rayleigh fading as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ase ] , it can be concluded that the impact of rician fading on the ase is negligible with a peak rician to rayleigh gain of about 1.02x at a bs density of 15.85 @xmath124 .",
    "the reason of this conclusion has been explained before , i.e. , the power variation of the nlos to los transition is in the order of 15 - 20 db according to the 3gpp path loss functions @xcite , while that of rayleigh to rician is in the order of @xmath123 3 db .",
    "hence , rayleigh or rician fading makes little difference against this abrupt change of interference strength .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the rician fading channel in a path loss model that incorporates both los and nlos transmissions in a dense scn .",
    "results show that rician fading has a negligible impact compared to rayleigh one on the system performance , indicating that the los and nlos path loss characteristics and not the multi - path fading ones dominate the scn performance in a single input single output scenario .",
    "similar to the previous observations under the rayleigh fading model , our results show that , when the density of bss exceeds a threshold , the ase starts to suffer from a slow growth or even a decrease for a given bs density range .",
    "the intuition is as follows .",
    "network densification causes a transition from nlos to los for a large number of interference signals as well as a channel diversity loss as los dominates .",
