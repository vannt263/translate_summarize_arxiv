    "in multiview geometry , the fundamental matrix and the trifocal tensor describe the relative orientation of two and three ( uncalibrated ) images respectively .",
    "if the cameras are pre - calibrated , i.e. we are given the calibration matrices for each view , the fundamental matrix is transformed to the so - called essential matrix .",
    "it was first introduced by longuet - higgins in  @xcite .",
    "the essential matrix has fewer degrees of freedom and additional algebraic properties , compared to the fundamental matrix .",
    "a detailed investigation of these properties is given by demazure , faugeras , maybank and other researchers in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the trifocal tensor for calibrated cameras ( we call this entity the calibrated trifocal tensor ) was first appeared in the papers by spetsakis and aloimonos  @xcite and weng , huang and ahuja  @xcite .",
    "later , hartley  @xcite generalized the trifocal tensor for the case of uncalibrated cameras .",
    "the properties of the ( uncalibrated ) trifocal tensors and their characterizations have been investigated by hartley , shashua , triggs and other researchers in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    as well as the essential matrix , the calibrated trifocal tensor has fewer degrees of freedom and additional algebraic properties , compared to the uncalibrated case .",
    "the investigation of these properties is the main purpose of the present paper . in particular , we show that the calibrated trifocal tensor must satisfy a number of low degree homogeneous polynomial equations .",
    "these equations arise from the characterization constraints on a certain complex matrix associated with a calibrated trifocal tensor .",
    "the results of the paper can be applied to different computer vision problems , such as metric scene reconstruction , camera self - calibration , bundle adjustment , etc .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prel ] , we recall some definitions and results from multiview geometry . in section  [ sec : character ] , we introduce a new notion  the trifocal essential matrix . on the one hand , it is a generalization of the ordinary ( bifocal ) essential matrix , and , on the other hand , it is closely related to the calibrated trifocal tensor .",
    "we prove the two necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize the set of trifocal essential matrices . in section",
    "[ sec : conds ] , we define the trifocal essential matrix associated with a calibrated trifocal tensor and give its geometric interpretation . based on the characterizations from section  [ sec : character ] , we propose our three necessary conditions .",
