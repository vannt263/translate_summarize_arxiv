    "<S> we present a simple supersymmetric model where the dominant decay mode of the lightest higgs boson is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a light pseudoscalar and @xmath2 is the charm quark . for </S>",
    "<S> such decays the higgs mass can be smaller than 100 gev without conflict with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> together with the fact that both the higgs and the pseudoscalar @xmath1 are pseudo - goldstone bosons , this resolves the little hierarchy problem .      </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry is probably the most appealing idea for solving the hierarchy problem of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> large corrections to the higgs mass are eliminated due to a symmetry between fermions and bosons which becomes manifest at energies of order the weak scale @xmath3 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that many supersymmetric models , in particular the mssm , imply that some superpartners and the higgs boson should have already been discovered at lep . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of such discoveries pushes these models into corners with a relatively large tuning among its basic parameters , of order 1% or worse . </S>",
    "<S> naturalness suggests that supersymmetry , if present at the weak scale , should be combined with additional ingredients .    </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to make the higgs a pseudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) of a global symmetry broken at the scale @xmath4  @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier applications of goldstone bosons in supersymmetric theories ) . </S>",
    "<S> this idea is usually referred to as _ double protection _ or the _ super - little _ higgs . in this class of models , the higgs and the fermionic sectors </S>",
    "<S> are realized in a similar vein as in the little higgs models @xcite , in particular collective breaking of the global symmetry is implemented .    combining supersymmetry with the little higgs mechanism further softens quantum corrections to the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the one - loop corrections to the higgs mass are completely finite , making electroweak symmetry breaking technically natural and alleviating the fine - tuning problem of minimal supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the downside of softening quantum corrections are the reduced one - loop contributions to the physical higgs mass  @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> it is very difficult to make the higgs mass larger than the lep bound of 114 gev without reintroducing fine - tuning or complicating the models by additional structures . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have recently showed  @xcite that in this class of models the higgs mass can be below 114 gev without conflicting the experimental constraints from lep . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible because the model predicts non - standard decays for the higgs . </S>",
    "<S> as advocated for example in  @xcite , the lep bounds can be relaxed if the higgs boson decays to a final state with four light standard model ( sm ) states .    in the model of  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the global symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath5 which , in addition to the higgs doublet , implies the existence of the fifth pseudo - goldstone boson @xmath1 who is a singlet under the sm gauge symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath1 is naturally light , lighter than the higgs boson , and has tree - level derivative couplings to the higgs suppressed by @xmath6-suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 is not much larger than the electroweak scale then the decay @xmath8 dominates , while the branching ratio for the standard @xmath9 channel can be suppressed below 20% which is consistent with lep bounds for a higgs mass of order @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case then the dominant higgs decay channel involves at least four sm states . </S>",
    "<S> the composition of the final state crucially depends on the mass and couplings of the intermediate state @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 is heavier than twice the bottom quark mass then higgs decays into a 4b final state which is excluded by lep for higgs masses below 110 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but when @xmath1 is lighter than @xmath11 it decays into 2 gluons via a loop of off - shell bottom quarks </S>",
    "<S> . then the dominant higgs decay channel is @xmath12 , which allows us to evade all existing lep bounds with the higgs as light as 80 - 90 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , such a 4 gluon jet final state is difficult to see not only at lep but also at hadron colliders such as tevatron and the lhc where it is _ buried _ under the overwhelming qcd background .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider an alternative implementation of the doubly protected higgs which leads to a different phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the present model has the same gauge symmetry @xmath13 and the global symmetry breaking @xmath5 that leads to 5 pseudo - goldstone bosons : the higgs doublet and a light pseudoscalar @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the main new feature is the embedding of the sm fermions into representations of the gauge group ; roughly , the representations of the up- and down - type quarks and leptons are interchanged with respect to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the striking consequence of that assignment is that the couplings of @xmath1 to the down type quarks and charged leptons can be very suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> if that is the case , @xmath1 does not decay to bottom quarks or tau leptons even if it is kinematically allowed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , unlike in all previous models of the light hidden higgs , the pseudoscalar mass does not have to be squeezed into a small window ( _ few _ gev @xmath14 ) in order to avoid the stringent lep bounds on the 4b final state ; instead , all the parameter space up to half the higgs mass is available .    as the decay modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 are suppressed , the branching ratio for @xmath1 decaying into two _ </S>",
    "<S> charm quarks _ is by far the largest . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant higgs decay channel is then @xmath17 for which the lep bounds are very similar as for the 4 g final state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio for @xmath18 ( where @xmath1 decay to gluons now proceeds mainly via a loop of charm quarks and its symmetry partners ) is at the level @xmath19 , while the branching ratio for decays with two photons in the final state is even more suppressed , at the level of @xmath20 . since charm tagging is difficult in hadron colliders such as the lhc and the tevatron , the _ charming higgs _ </S>",
    "<S> may well be _ buried _ under the qcd background unless dedicated search strategies are devised .      </S>",
    "<S> we consider a supersymmetric model with the higgs arising as a pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate @xmath21 global symmetry spontaneously broken to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the global @xmath21 is a residue of an extended gauge symmetry broken at higher energies of order 10 tev . in our model , the sm gauge symmetry </S>",
    "<S> is extended to @xmath23 which is then broken by two pairs of triplet higgses @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the following charges : [ e.pgb ]    c|c|c|c| & su(3)_c & su(3)_w & u(1)_x + _ u,_u & 1 & |3 & 1/3 + _ d,_d & 1 & 3 & -1/3    . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s do not mix in the superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an enlarged su(3)@xmath28 @xmath29su(3)@xmath30 approximate global symmetry where the two group factors independently rotate the respective triplet pair . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath26 s are assumed to have a supersymmetric vev : _ u = _ d ^t = ( 0,0,f/ ) with @xmath31 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this breaks the gauge group down to @xmath32 with the hypercharge realized as @xmath33 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> su(3)@xmath30 survives down to lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , loops involving the top quark and its symmetry partners generate a negative mass squared for @xmath34 ( and also the quartic term ) which induces a vev of @xmath34 of order @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then the approximate global su(3)@xmath36 symmetry is spontaneously broken to su(2 ) and produces 5 pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> four of them corresponds to the higgs doublet whose 3 components are non - physical and eaten by the w and z bosons . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves two physical pgbs . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to use the following embedding of these two pgbs into the higgs triplets : @xmath37 in the above @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the analogue of the mssm @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath41 is the pgb higgs whose vev will break the electroweak symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the other physical pgb @xmath42 is a singlet under the sm gauge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs boson field @xmath43 is obtained by the shift @xmath44 , while the canonically normalized singlet is @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> once the fermions are introduced ( see the next section ) the non - linear sigma model scale @xmath7 is generated dynamically by loops of the top quark and its symmetry partners , in close analogy to generation of the higgs vev in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the case where @xmath7 is not too large , of order @xmath46 gev which requires some mild tuning among the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the radial mode corresponding to the oscillations of @xmath7 ( which is not a pgb ) has a mass of order 200 - 300 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the top / stop loops also generate the vev @xmath47 of the higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak scale is related to the higgs vev by v_ew = f ( v / f ) , and the higgs mass ends up in the range 80 - 90 gev for a generic point in the parameter space .      </S>",
    "<S> the third generation quarks and leptons are embedded into the following anomaly free representations : @xmath48 the third generation quark sector is fairly simple , in fact it coincides with the extended quark sector of common little higgs models . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the sm , only one heavy vector - like top quark is added . </S>",
    "<S> this matter content can be obtained from an underlying @xmath49 symmetry , see the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the masses for all quarks can be obtained from the superpotential [ e.yc ] y_1 t_c^1 _ u q + y_2 t_c^2 _ </S>",
    "<S> u q + y_b _ v b_c^1 q _ d _ d. the sm top mass follows @xmath50 while the mass of the heavy top partner is m_t = . </S>",
    "<S> note that the couplings in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e.yc ] ) are non - generic , as the gauge symmetry also allows for [ e.ync ] y_1 t_c^1 _ u </S>",
    "<S> q + y_2 t_c^2 _ u q. we assume that the tilded yukawas are absent or small ( which in practice means @xmath51 or less ) . in this case the approximate global @xmath52 symmetry acting on @xmath34 is only _ collectively _ broken by the renormalizable couplings . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , su(3)@xmath36 would be unbroken by ( [ e.yc ] ) if @xmath53 , and also if @xmath54 ( in which case the global rotation of @xmath55 could be compensated by a global rotation of @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the order parameter for the explicit breaking of the global @xmath57 symmetry is proportional to @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> when the collective breaking is implemented the top loop contributions to the pgb higgs mass are finite at one loop in a supersymmetric theory because they have to be proportional to @xmath59 and there is simply no room for another mass parameter . in order to keep the size of loop corrections under control both @xmath60 and @xmath61 have to be below 1 tev ( since @xmath62 tev the latter requires @xmath63 ) . given these assumptions , electroweak symmetry breaking has no fine - tuning at all .    </S>",
    "<S> the present choice of the quark content is somewhat more appealing than that in @xcite . while the bottom quark mass originates from non - renormalizable couplings , </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily cured by integrating in a vector - like pair of @xmath64 and color triplets @xmath65 , @xmath66 with zero @xmath67 charge , and adding the couplings @xmath68 to the superpotential . for large @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the effective non - renormalizable interaction in ( [ e.yc ] ) with @xmath70 and the resulting bottom mass is @xmath71 . due to the fact that the bottom quark is much lighter than the electroweak scale we are free to choose large @xmath69 , as large as @xmath72 tev . without including @xmath73 the 1-loop @xmath74-function for qcd vanishes , while with these fields added it is positive which leads to a landau pole below the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> typically , there is also a landau pole for the @xmath75 yukawa coupling which should be large in order to minimize fine tuning . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the landau pole @xmath76 $ ] varies between @xmath77 and @xmath78 tev .    </S>",
    "<S> for the second generation quarks we assume that the same matter structure is repeated , just replacing the yukawa couplings @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the charm mass is given by m_c = s_b y_c1 y_c2 f v_ew . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that there are two ways to make the charm quark mass hierarchically smaller than @xmath80 : either @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 gev to make the charm partner heavy enough ) or the other way around . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we choose the former possibility ; the latter leads to very suppressed couplings of @xmath1 to the charm quarks and similar phenomenology as in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the charged lepton sector is somewhat more complicated , which is the price we have to pay for canceling the anomalies . in particular , the sm tau lepton has three heavy partner states , while in the neutrino sector we have one heavy partner state ; note that majorana masses are not allowed by this representation assignment . in the lepton sector we have multiple options for writing the yukawa couplings consistent with the collective symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> here we concentrate on the following set of yukawas : @xmath83 this is a collective yukawa , since a global su(3 ) emerges if one sets either @xmath84 or @xmath85 to zero . in the absence of the @xmath84 term </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath86-partners pick up a mass proportional to @xmath87 and are pushed into the tev range . </S>",
    "<S> including @xmath84 provides the mass for the sm @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> at this point the neutrino mass matrix has one zero eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> this can be taken care of by adding the coupling @xmath88 with @xmath89 .      </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss the higgs decay modes , and argue that the @xmath92 mode dominates if the global symmetry scale @xmath7 is not much larger than the electroweak scale . even though @xmath1 is a complete su(2 ) singlet , it does have a tree - level derivative coupling to the higgs field @xmath43 due to @xmath43 partly living in the third component of @xmath93 . the symmetry preserving derivative coupling </S>",

    "<S> the relevant quantity for lep searches , customarily denoted as @xmath99 , is the branching ratio for a decay into @xmath100 quarks multiplied by the suppression of the higgs production cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is also relevant here because the coupling of the pgb higgs to the z boson is multiplied , much as the higgs - fermion coupling , by the factor @xmath101 as compared to the sm coupling . </S>",
