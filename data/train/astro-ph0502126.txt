    "the popular @xmath4 cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) cosmological concordance model has been very successful in describing the properties of the universe on large and intermediate scales , but has encountered numerous difficulties on smaller , galactic and sub - galactic scales ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . among the most obvious discrepancies is the prediction that there should be a factor of 50 more satellites orbiting in the milky way halo , with the masses comparable and larger than the conventional estimates for galactic dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , than is actually observed  the so - called `` missing satellites '' problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite gave a possible solution to this problem .",
    "they argued that the properties of galactic dsphs are consistent with them being embedded in very extended dark matter ( dm ) halos , with total masses comparable to the masses of the largest substructure predicted to populate the milky way halo by @xmath4cdm cosmologies .",
    "there have also been cosmology - independent arguments in favor of much more massive dsphs than the conventional @xmath5  m@xmath1 estimates based on the `` mass follows light '' assumption @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles for fornax and draco under the assumption that the anisotropy parameter @xmath6 is a constant , and derived the total masses for these galaxies of @xmath7  m@xmath1 .",
    "( here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the tangential and radial velocity dispersion , respectively . ) from fitting a two parameter family of spherical models of @xcite to the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile in draco , @xcite concluded that the mass - to - light ratio in this dwarf increases outwards .",
    "@xcite used large - field multicolor photometry of an area of 27 square degrees in the vicinity of draco to show that this galaxy has very regular stellar isodensity contours down to their sensitivity limit ( 0.003 of the central surface brightness ) , with no signs of tidal interaction with the milky way .",
    "this implies that draco has more dm in its outskirts than in its center and a practically unconstrained upper limit on total mass . @xcite and @xcite",
    "proposed two different models ( supernovae ia heating of the ism and radiation harassment by the ionizing photons from the host galaxy , respectively ) to explain complex star formation history of some dsphs .",
    "the important ingredient of both scenarios is the requirement for dsphs to be very massive ( @xmath10  m@xmath11 ) so that the fully ionized ism would not escape to intergalactic space .",
    "if it is indeed the case that many galactic dsphs have massive , @xmath12  m@xmath1 dm halos ( which would translate into their apparent tidal radii being @xmath13 angular degrees in the sky ) , then the observed distribution of stars in these galaxies should have been entirely shaped by internal processes , and not by the tidal field of the milky way .",
    "the current stellar density in galactic dsphs is extremely low ( they are dm dominated even at the center ) , with the estimated dynamical relaxation time for stars being much larger than the hubble time ( assuming that the dm halo is sufficiently smooth at the center ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume then that the distribution of stars in dsphs has stayed unchanged since the initial star formation epoch .",
    "@xcite noted that the core line - of - sight velocity dispersion in draco and ursa minor ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 ) is of the same order as the sound speed in a diffuse cooling cloud of primordial composition .",
    "he argued that a simple model of stars forming from isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a dm halo with the plummer density profile provides a reasonably good description of the observed properties of these two dsphs .",
    "his conclusion was that the apparent cutoff radius in the distribution of stars in draco and ursa minor has nothing to do with galactic tides .",
    "here we propose a simple star formation model for dsphs .",
    "we assume that stars formed from isothermal self - gravitating gas in hydrostatic equilibrium inside an extended dm halo .",
    "we simulate the relaxation of the stellar cluster after the leftover gas is expelled using an @xmath16-body code .",
    "we significantly improve upon the model of @xcite by ( 1 ) considering self - gravity of gas and stars , ( 2 ) allowing for dynamical relaxation of stars after expelling the leftover gas , ( 3 ) introducing a lower density cutoff for star formation , and ( 4 ) using properly normalized @xmath4cdm dm halos .",
    "we show that our models are consistent with the existing observations on three out of four dsphs studied in this paper , if one assumes that these dwarfs have very massive ( @xmath0  m@xmath1 ) dm halos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe our model . in section  [ comparison ]",
    "we present our algorithm for finding best fitting models .",
    "we present our results for four dsphs in section  [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the results in section  [ discussion ] , and give our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we assume that initially gas was isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium in the static potential of the dm halo .",
    "stars are assumed to have formed from gas instantaneously with a certain efficiency @xmath17 out to a radius where the gas density drops below some critical value .",
    "the velocity dispersion of newly born stars is assumed to be equal to the sound speed in the gas .",
    "after the leftover gas is expelled instantaneously by the combined action of ionizing radiation , stellar winds , and supernova explosions , the stellar cluster is relaxed over a few crossing times through violent relaxation and/or phase mixing .",
    "we simulate this process numerically using an @xmath16-body code .",
    "as we will show in this paper , in our model the stellar cluster does not expand much after the star burst , resulting in the final central velocity dispersion being only @xmath18% smaller than the initial value .",
    "the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion for dsphs is in the narrow interval @xmath19  km  s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that this parameter is almost constant for all galactic dsphs .",
    "it is also comparable to the sound speed in the warm neutral medium , @xmath20  km  s@xmath15 , in the ism of the milky way ( @xcite ; we used their `` standard '' model and assumed that the mean molecular weight is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the proton ) , and ism velocity dispersion of @xmath23  km  s@xmath15 in dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion of young stars in the galactic disk , @xmath24  km  s@xmath15 @xcite , is also in the same range , giving support to our model assumption that the velocity dispersion of newly born stars is comparable to the sound speed in the star - forming gas .    to justify our assumption of the gas being isothermal , we should mention that in all of our models the relaxed stellar clusters are almost isothermal ( in terms of total stellar velocity dispersion ) .",
    "galactic dsphs are known to have roughly isothermal line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles in their central regions @xcite .",
    "we can also reproduce the observed decline in the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the outskirts of some dsphs @xcite , which in our model is caused by a fraction of stars which move beyond the initial stellar cluster radius during the dynamical relaxation phase , and as a result have strong radial anisotropy .    because the dm halo potential in our model is static ,",
    "neither adiabatic contraction of the central part of dm halo due to presence of baryons nor adiabatic expansion after the removal of the remaining gas in a post - starburst system are modeled .",
    "static potential models presented in this paper took around 500 cpu - days to compute ; live dm halo simulations would take orders of magnitude longer to run , which is obviously not feasible . from both observational and theoretical points of view , the situation with inner density profiles of dm halos is less than clear .",
    "observations produce less steep inner density slopes for galactic dm halos ( @xmath25 ) than the predictions of cosmological cdm models ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "though a few mechanisms [ such as warm dm @xcite , recoiling black holes @xcite , and dynamic heating due to presence of dense gas clumps @xcite ] were proposed to bring theory in agreement with observations , none of these explanations has received yet wide acceptance . given the uncertainty in the inner density slope for galactic dm halos",
    ", we believe that by considering two different types of static dm halos , with flat core ( @xmath27 ) and with @xmath28 cusp , we alleviated some inadequacies resulting from the use of static dm potential .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium of self - gravitating gas inside the static potential of a spherical dm halo can be described using the following expression :    @xmath29    here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the pressure and the density of gas , and @xmath32 is the total gravitational potential with contributions from both gas and dm .",
    "the radial gradient of gravitational potential in equation  ( [ hydstat ] ) can be calculated as @xmath33/r^2 $ ] , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the enclosed masses of dm and gas , respectively , and @xmath36 is the gravitational constant . to close equation  ( [ hydstat ] ) , one has to write poisson equation for the gas component :    @xmath37    here @xmath38 is the gas contribution to the total potential .",
    "we consider two types of dm halo density profiles : flat - core @xcite halos and navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halos which have a central density cusp with @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the density profiles for these halos are as follows :    @xmath39}\\quad\\mbox{(burkert),}\\\\ \\rho(r ) & = & \\frac{\\rho_{0}}{r / r_s\\ , ( 1+r / r_s)^2}\\quad\\mbox{(nfw).}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the scaling radius and density for dm halos . ( in burkert halos , @xmath41 corresponds to the central dm density ; in nfw halos , which have divergent central density , @xmath42 at @xmath43 . )    for the following analysis , it is convenient to switch to new dimensionless variables : @xmath44 for radial distance , @xmath45 for density , @xmath46 for mass , @xmath47 for velocity , and @xmath48 for time . in these new variables ,",
    "the enclosed dm mass for the two types of halos can be written as follows :    @xmath49 & \\mbox{(burkert),}\\cr \\ln(1+x)-x/(1+x ) & \\mbox{(nfw)}.\\cr } \\ ] ]    we assume that gas is isothermal : @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 is the sound speed in gas , which is assumed to be constant ) . equations  ( [ hydstat ] ) and ( [ poi ] ) then can be rewritten as    @xmath52,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath53    equations  ( [ ms][ode2 ] ) form a system of two ordinary differential equations for two variables , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which has to be solved numerically .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath56 ( a free parameter ) and @xmath57 .",
    "we adopt a simple star formation model .",
    "we assume that a certain mass fraction @xmath17 of gas is turned instantaneously into stars everywhere inside the halo where the dimensionless gas density is above a certain threshold value @xmath58 ( in units of the central gas density @xmath59 ) .",
    "in other words , star formation efficiency is assumed to be @xmath17 ( a constant ) for @xmath60 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 was introduced to avoid the star formation occuring at unphysically low densities .",
    "the newly born stars are assumed to have an isotropic distribution of velocity vectors , with the one - dimensional velocity dispersion equal to the sound speed in gas @xmath61 .    after the starburst",
    ", all the remaining gas is assumed to be removed from the system instantaneously by the combined action of ionizing radiation , stellar winds , and supernovae explosions . in reality",
    ", a fraction of this gas can be later reaccreted by the halo leading to subsequent episodes of star formation . for simplicity",
    ", here we consider all stars in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy to be formed in a single starburst .",
    "it is easy to see that models with @xmath62 and @xmath63 will remain in equilibrium after all gas is turned into stars .",
    "indeed , our hydrostatic gas equilibrium equation  ( [ hydstat ] ) is identical to the isotropic stellar jeans equation if @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "( here @xmath66 and @xmath67 are density and one - dimensional velocity dispersion of stars . )    for the cases with @xmath68 and/or @xmath69 , the initial configuration of stars after the gas removal is not an equilibrium one : stars are dynamically hot , and will expand before reaching an equilibrium state .",
    "this highly non - linear process involves phase mixing and/or violent relaxation .",
    "consequently , we had to resort to numerical @xmath16-body simulations to derive the final equilibrium configuration of our stellar clusters .",
    "to run the simulations , we used the parallel version of the popular multistepping tree code gadget @xcite .",
    "overall , there are four free parameters in our model which can influence properties of relaxed stellar clusters : the sound speed in gas in units of the halo scaling velocity @xmath61 , the central density of gas in units of the halo scaling density @xmath70 , the star formation efficiency @xmath17 , and the minimum gas density @xmath58 for star formation to take place in units of the central gas density .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 can be considered as a measure of how hot gas is in relation to the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "the nuance is that in our model the gas temperature is measured in terms of `` scaling temperature '' which can be defined as @xmath71 , whereas the usual definition for the virial temperature of a halo is @xmath72 .",
    "( here @xmath73 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , @xmath74 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the halo circular speed at the scaling radius @xmath40 and the virial radius @xmath77 , respectively . )",
    "the connection between @xmath78 and @xmath79 depends on halo density profile ( burkert or nfw ) and concentration @xmath80 .",
    "for example , for both burkert and nfw halos with @xmath81 , gas in our models is at the virial temperature when @xmath82 .",
    "we consider three values of the parameter @xmath58 : 0 ( no star formation cutoff ) , 0.1 , and 0.3 .",
    "we cover a wide range of values for the remaining three parameters : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "to generate an initial particle distribution for the @xmath16-body simulations , we use the enclosed gas mass function @xmath55 which is derived numerically by solving equations  ( [ ms][ode2 ] ) .",
    "first , we find the star formation cutoff radius @xmath86 such as @xmath87 .",
    "( for the case of @xmath63 , @xmath86 is set to be equal to the largest considered radius @xmath88 ) .",
    "next , the integral probability function @xmath89 is constructed as @xmath90 . for each @xmath16-body particle , the radial distance @xmath91 is obtained by generating a uniform random number @xmath92 $ ] and then solving numerically the equation @xmath93 .",
    "finally , to obtain three components of the radius and velocity vectors we assume that they are randomly oriented in space , which is true for a spherically symmetric system with isotropic distribution of velocity vectors .",
    "we assumed maxwellian distribution of velocities , with the one - dimensional velocity dispersion equal to the sound speed in the gas @xmath61 .",
    "all our models were simulated with @xmath94 equal mass stellar particles .",
    "this number is large enough to allow for accurate surface brightness profile calculations over a large range of radial distances and to avoid significant spurious dynamical evolution caused by close encounters between particles . at the same time",
    ", @xmath16 is small enough to make it feasible to simulate hundreds of models .",
    "the masses of individual particles are equal to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the total stellar mass .",
    "the value of the gravitational softening length @xmath97 was calculated as @xmath98 @xcite , where the initial stellar half - mass radius @xmath99 was derived by solving the equation @xmath100 .",
    "the values of the gadget parameters which control accuracy of integration were the same as in @xcite , where a total energy conservation of better than 2% was achieved when simulating a globular cluster for 6000 crossing times at the half - mass radius .",
    "in particular , the individual time steps in the simulations were equal to @xmath101 , with the accuracy parameter @xmath102 .",
    "( here @xmath103 is the acceleration of a particle . )",
    "the parameter controlling the force calculation accuracy ( errtolforceacc in gadget notation ) was set to 0.01 .    in the @xmath16-body simulations ,",
    "the dm halo is represented by a static gravitational potential , which is identical to the one used for solving equations  ( [ ms][ode2 ] ) .",
    "the important point to make is that our dm halos are not truncated at the virial radius  neither in solving equations  ( [ ms][ode2 ] ) nor in @xmath16-body simulations .",
    "we did the consistency check ( that the observed size of the galaxy is smaller than the inferred virial and tidal radii ) after fitting the models to observations .",
    "we ran our @xmath16-body models for the interval of time @xmath104 ( in dimensionless units ) , with 200 intermediate snapshots per model .",
    "this time interval is much larger than the crossing time @xmath105 at the scaling radius @xmath40 , which is @xmath106 for all our models .",
    "to cover well the 4-dimensional free parameter space , we had to run a significant number of models ( around 700 ) . to facilitate the process",
    ", we designed a pipeline for automatic generation of observable properties of the models for given dm halo profile ( burkert or nfw ) and given values of the four initial free parameters @xmath61 , @xmath70 , @xmath17 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the pipeline consists of the following steps .    1 .",
    "system of differential equations  ( [ ms][ode2 ] ) is solved numerically , producing isothermal hydrostatic gas distribution in the potential of the dm halo .",
    "2 .   using the procedure described above in this section , the initial distribution of stellar particles is generated .",
    "an @xmath16-body code is run to simulate the stellar cluster relaxation in the static dm halo potential .",
    "4 .   for last @xmath107 snapshots ( corresponding to @xmath108 ) , both time - averaged values and standard deviations from mean are calculated for surface brightness @xmath109 in different radial bins . to calculate @xmath109 ,",
    "we use the projection method described in appendix  b of @xcite . the noisier innermost and outermost parts of the surface brightness profile are cut off at the radii where the standard deviation from mean becomes larger than @xmath110  dex . in this fashion , we ensure that the inner part of the @xmath109 profile has converged to better than @xmath111  dex ( because of very short crossing time near the halo center resulting in virtually uncorrelated surface brightness values in different snapshots ) , and that the outer part of the profile ( where a strong correlation is expected ) has converged to @xmath112  dex .",
    "we repeat this procedure for a smaller number of snapshots @xmath113 ( corresponding to @xmath114 ) , and choose the profile which has converged over a larger range of radial distances .",
    "we calculate a line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath115 [ using a procedure delineated in appendix  b of @xcite ] averaged over the core region of the galaxy ( within the half - brightness radius ) and time - averaged over the last @xmath116 snapshots .    as a test , we compared the radial stellar density profiles in our evolved models with @xmath62 and @xmath63 with the corresponding initial gas density profiles ( they should be identical  see   [ sfdr ] ) . in most of the models ,",
    "the profiles are found to be identical within the measurements errors . in a few high density models , with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we see spurious flattening of the inner stellar density profile due to interaction between stellar particles .",
    "this effect is found to be negligible at the radii larger than the softening length @xmath97 .",
    "surface brightness profiles in our relaxed models exhibit a variety of shapes  from simple cases of monotonously increasing slope , to profiles with one or more inflection points .",
    "the important fact is that in most cases we observe a flat core plus extended halo ( with different slopes ) in the surface brightness profiles for both burkert and nfw static halos  somewhat like profiles of dsphs .",
    "an obvious central stellar cusp is seen only in the models with strongly self - gravitating gas : @xmath119 ( for both burkert and nfw halos ) .",
    "our relaxed stellar models are approximately isothermal ( in terms of total three - dimensional velocity dispersion ) . for models with non - zero star formation",
    "lower density cutoff , @xmath58 , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles are often sharply declining at large radii .",
    "for such models , the outer stellar halo is strongly radially anisotropic .    on average , our relaxing stellar clusters do not expand much , and as a consequence do not cool down much adiabatically . for all our models ,",
    "the ratio of initial ( non - equilibrium ) core line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath120 to its final , relaxed value @xmath115 varies between @xmath121 and 0.43  dex , with a small average value of @xmath122  dex . to explain this model property ,",
    "let us consider the extreme case of @xmath123 resulting in the largest possible expansion factor .",
    "initially , stars are born on equilibrium orbits ( due to the fact that our hydrostatic equilibrium equation is identical to the isotropic stellar jeans equation ",
    "see section  [ sfdr ] ) .",
    "an instantaneous removal of virtually all baryons after the starburst does not change individual orbital angular momenta of the stars , resulting in the following adiabatic law :    @xmath124    here @xmath91 is the baryonic half - mass radius and @xmath125 is stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "suffix `` ini '' stands for the initial , non - equilibrium values .",
    "the virial equation for the relaxed cluster in case of @xmath126 is    @xmath127    where the gravitational radius is assumed to be equal to the half - mass radius .",
    "we estimate the largest expansion factor @xmath128 by combining equations  ( [ adiabata ] ) and ( [ virial ] ) :    @xmath129    assuming that most of the gas is concentrated within the scaling radius of the dm halo ( which is the case for almost all of our models ) , @xmath130 can be approximated as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 for nfw and 3 for burkert halos . in this case",
    ", the expansion factor can be written as    @xmath133^{1/(\\alpha+1)}.\\ ] ]    it happens , that for isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium inside a static dm halo , the estimated expansion factor @xmath128 is never larger than @xmath134 for the whole range of considered @xmath61 and @xmath70 , and for both nfw and burkert halo density profiles ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . for less extreme cases ( with larger @xmath17 )",
    "we expect the expansion factor to be even closer to unity .    to illustrate the impact of a lower density cutoff for star formation @xmath58 on our models , we show in figure  [ fig2 ] a few radial profiles for burkert models with @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "from the panel ( a ) of this figure one can see that non - zero values of @xmath58 both change global properties of the relaxed stellar clusters ( such as central density and size ) and modify the shape of the density profile . in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig2 ]",

    "the authors use single - color photometry to identify stars belonging to these galaxies . as a result , the star count profiles for these three dsphs are of much lower quality than the draco data of @xcite , who employed a multicolor mask filtering technique to improve the sensitivity to draco stars by a factor of @xmath270 .",
    "one has to keep in mind that simple single - color techniques [ such as used by @xcite ] can produce very unreliable results at surface brightness levels below the foreground / background contamination level .",

    "properties of three models with @xmath273 are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] . with such small statistics",
    "it is hard to draw any conclusions on the range of model parameters , but it appears that all the main parameters for sculptor are comparable to those for draco .",

    "as in the cases of draco and sculptor , the surface brightness profiles of our carina models are identical to the best fitting theoretical king model in the inner part of the galaxy , and become less steep in its outskirts .    unlike draco and sculptor , all `` good '' carina models have burkert dm density profile .",

    "the second - to - best model has @xmath296 .",
    "one could try to argue that the failure to find a model with @xmath297 is due to the fact that the king model already provides an almost perfect fit to the data ( see figure  [ fig8]a ) .",
    "it is conceivable that with unlimited computing resources we would be able to fine - tune our initial parameters to find a model which would fit the observed surface brightness profile slightly better than the king model .",
    "however , king - like profiles are not natural for our models ( which typically have less steep outer density profiles ) , and it would be very unlikely that it is a mere accident that fornax happened to have an almost perfect king profile .",
    "the tidal stripping process , on the other hand , drives naturally an isothermal stellar system toward a king - like state , which makes it a more attractive explanation for the fornax observed properties .",
    "the inferred parameters for our best fitting model ( table  [ tab2 ] ) make even more questionable the applicability of our model to fornax .",
    "in particular , the inferred central gas density @xmath298  cm@xmath223 is much lower than for the other three dsphs .",
    "furthermore , all models with @xmath299 have @xmath63 .",
    "it seems unphysical for star formation to take place with almost 100% efficiency ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) at densities @xmath300  cm@xmath223 .",
    "all of the above leads us to conclude that our model ( at least in its present , simplest form ) is not applicable to the fornax dsph .",
    "it remains to be seen if some other non - tidal mechanism could produce naturally a king - like surface brightness profile in a dsph . for",
    "now , fornax being a tidally limited system seems to be the most likely explanation .",
    "it is interesting to note that even in the tidally limited scenario , fornax appears to have a quite large mass , with the `` mass follows light '' estimate of @xmath301  m@xmath1 @xcite , and potentially even larger value if fornax is more dm dominated in its outskirts .",
    "the observational data on three galaxies ( draco , sculptor , and carina ) out of four dsphs studied in this paper appear to be consistent with our simple model of star formation in extended dm halos , and as a consequence are consistent with them having very massive dm halos .",
    "the galaxy with the best quality star count profiles ( draco ) is also the one which makes the most convincing case for having an extended halo  both in the analysis of @xcite who showed that the outer stellar isophotes for draco are not tidally distorted , and in the analysis carried out in this paper .",
    "the data for fornax appear not to be consistent with the predictions of our model .",
    "the surface brightness profile for this galaxy is almost perfectly described by a theoretical king model , which was derived for an isothermal system exposed to external tidal field .",
    "this type of profile does not come naturally in our model .",
    "in addition , the best fitting model for fornax predicts that the star formation in this dwarf should have taken place at unphysically low densities of @xmath302  cm@xmath223 .",
    "the results of our simulations are thus suggestive of the cutoff in the outer surface brightness profile of fornax being caused by the tidal field of the milky way .",
    "the situation is significantly different with the three other dsphs we studied in this paper ( draco , sculptor , and carina ) , which appear to have extended dm halos .",
    "this difference can be explained if ( 1 ) the orbit of fornax has a significantly smaller pericenter distance than the orbits of the other three galaxies [ but this seems to be inconsistent with the available proper motion measurements @xcite , which imply that fornax is on a low eccentricity orbit and is currently near its pericenter ] , and/or ( 2 ) the average dm density within the stellar extent of fornax ( radius of @xmath303  kpc ) is significantly smaller than the average dm density within the same radius of the three other dsphs .",
    "( the latter would be the case if fornax was formed more recently than the three other galaxies . )",
    "the conclusion we reach here is quite contrary to the conventional argument that the presence of `` extratidal '' stars ( those which populate the outer halo of the dwarf galaxy beyond the tidal radius of the best - fitting king model ) around milky way satellites is a good evidence for the dwarf galaxy to have undergone a tidal disruption process , with the observed `` extratidal '' stars being part of the halo of tidally stripped stars . in our model , star formation in extended dm halos naturally produces surface brightness profiles which are identical to king profiles out to a few core radii , and are less steep in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "the example of fornax suggests that actually the absence of `` extratidal '' halo , with the galactic surface brightness profile being described almost perfectly by theoretical king profile , could be an evidence for the galaxy to be observed all the way to its tidal radius . in such tidally limited systems a small number of stars do have to populate an extratidal halo , forming leading and trailing tidal tails , but for stable satellite galaxies the surface brightness of such tails can be very low ( especially if dsphs have more dm in their outskirts than at the center , which appears to be the case for draco ) , potentially below the sensitivity of existing observations .",
    "the systems where tidal tails have been reliably detected ( such as sagittarius dsph and palomar  5 ) are at the last stage of being tidally disrupted , which can not be the case for most galactic dsphs .",
    "we argue that to rule out our alternative , non - tidal explanation for the presence of `` extratidal '' stars around some galactic dsphs , unambiguous observational evidence for these stars forming leading and trailing tidal tails has to be obtained .",
    "recent observations suggest that in some galactic dsphs ( draco , ursa minor , and sextans ) the very outskirts of the galaxies have lower values of line - of - sight velocity dispersion than the bulk of the galaxy @xcite . in our models , this is the case for all models with sufficiently large lower density cutoffs for star formation : @xmath304 ( see figures  [ fig4]b-[fig6]b ) . for such models , we observe the line - of - sight velocity dispersion to decline by a factor of two in the outer parts of the galaxy , which is caused by strong radial anisotropy of stars which were born within the initial stellar cluster radius @xmath305 and then later populated the @xmath306 parts of the galaxy",
    ".    the fornax @xcite , draco @xcite , and sextans @xcite observations suggest that these galaxies are kinematically colder at the center than in the intermediate regions .",
    "such behavior can not be explained in terms of our single star burst model .",
    "many dsphs however have complex ancient ( @xmath307  gyr old ) star formation histories , with slightly younger and/or more metal rich stars being more concentrated toward the center @xcite . a natural extension of our model then would be to assume that a fraction of gas , which was somewhat metal - enriched and expelled to large radii during the first star burst , was later reaccreted , leading to the second episode of star formation .",
    "the reaccretion of the gas and the second star burst can be delayed by up to a few gyrs by supernovae type ia occurring in the original stellar population @xcite .",

    "the exponent in equation  ( [ sound ] ) is positive for both burkert and nfw halos ( the exponent values are @xmath320 and @xmath321 , respectively ) . due to gas consumption by star formation , and potentially some additional gas losses into intergalactic space ,",
    "the total gas mass in the second star burst is smaller than in the original star burst : @xmath322 . from equation  ( [ sound ] ) , this results in the sound speed ( and hence the temperature ) of the gas in the second star burst being lower than in the first one : @xmath323 .",
    "both lower temperature and lower total gas mass will also result in the gas cloud being more compact in the second star burst . as a result , a kinematically colder stellar core ,",
    "slightly younger and slightly more metal rich than the bulk of the galaxy , could be formed .",
    "a multiple star bursts scenario can explain the radial population gradients observed in many local group dsphs @xcite , and possibly the kink observed in the surface brightness profile of draco at the radius of @xmath324  arcmin @xcite .",
    "[ note that no kink is observed in the draco profile of @xcite . ]    for the three galaxies , which appear to be consistent with our model ( draco , sculptor , and carina ) , the values of the inferred model parameters presented in table  [ tab2 ] do not differ much from one galaxy to another .",
    "the `` good '' models for these galaxies have a shallow inner dm density profile ( with the slope @xmath325 ) , which is consistent with the observations of dwarf spiral galaxies @xcite , dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite , and low surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the typical virial masses for the dm halos are of order of @xmath0  m@xmath1 , with the total range spanning from @xmath326  m@xmath1 .",
    "these masses are much larger than those obtained under assumption of constant mass - to - light ratio , and are consistent with the idea that dsphs represent the largest subhalos expected to populate the milky way halo in cosmological @xmath4cdm simulations @xcite , alleviating the `` missing satellites '' problem of such cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the inferred formation redshifts for these galaxies are @xmath327 ( lookback time @xmath328  gyr ) , which is consistent with the age of the oldest stars in these galaxies @xcite .",
    "the virial radii for the dm halos at the time of their formation range from @xmath329  kpc , whereas the tidal radii at their current distance from the milky way center are @xmath330  kpc ( typically @xmath14  kpc , which would correspond to @xmath331 angular degrees in the sky for these three dsphs ) .",
    "both virial and tidal radii are significantly larger than the observed extent of these galaxies .",
    "the star forming gas in the `` good '' models has a temperature of @xmath332  k if it is neutral ( @xmath333  k if it is ionized ) , a central density of @xmath14  cm@xmath223 , and a central pressure of @xmath334  k  cm@xmath223 . the temperature of the gas is a factor of @xmath335 lower than the virial temperature of the dm halo ( defined in   [ numer ] ) , suggesting that the gas accreted by the dm halo experienced only modest level of radiative cooling globally prior to the starburst .",
    "the lower density cutoff for star formation is of order of @xmath336  cm@xmath223 .",
    "the inferred star formation efficiency in the star - forming central part of ism is @xmath14% .",
    "we argue that our results are not very sensitive to the model assumption that the dm potential is static . during the formation of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy , gradual collapse of the gas cloud due to radiative",
    "cooling and gravitational instability will lead to the adiabatic contraction of the dm halo in the central region of the galaxy , where the enclosed gas mass becomes larger than that of dm .",
    "proper modeling of this process requires adding many physical processes ( live dm halo , non - equilibrium chemistry , radiative heating and cooling ) with many associated free parameters , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we argue that our main results should not be significantly affected by the above effect by noting that ( 1 ) in our best fitting models , gas does not significantly dominate dm at the center of the galaxy ( with the maximum ratio of the enclosed gas mass to that of dm of 10 for the sculptor best fitting model ; in case of the draco1 dataset , this ratio is less than @xmath320 at any radius ) , and ( 2 ) the initial adiabatic contraction of the dm halo will be compensated by the adiabatic expansion caused by the removal of @xmath337% of baryons from the central part of the galaxy by stellar feedback mechanisms after the starburst .    another potential pitfall is our assumption that the tidal field of milky way played no role in shaping the stellar outskirts of the dsphs we studied .",
    "judging from the data presented in table  [ tab2 ] , this assumption appears to be justified . in particular , the inferred tidal radii are significantly larger than the observed extent of these dwarfs ( by a factor of @xmath338 ) .",
    "we do not expect many dsph stars to be tidally stripped under these circumstances .",
    "more accurate analysis of this effect is complicated as it would involve high resolution @xmath16-body simulations of a two - component ( dm @xmath339 stars ) dwarf satellite in the potential of the host galaxy with some prescription for dynamical friction to describe the orbital decay , and with many poorly known orbital and milky way halo parameters .",
    "this task is beyond the scope of our paper , where our main goal is to sample well the initial model parameter space , with the only practical way of achieving this being in keeping the number of free parameters as small as possible .",
    "the selective nature of the tidal disruption of satellites in the halo of the host galaxy could make our method of finding the most likely dm halo progenitors for galactic dsphs (   [ par3 ] ) invalid . however , this effect would be important only if the dm halos in our best fitting models were relatively easy to disrupt over the hubble time in the tidal field of milky way . in the case of the draco1 dataset",
    ", the best fitting model has an nfw dm density profile and the inferred tidal radius of @xmath340 ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations of @xcite demonstrated that nfw subhalos orbiting in the host halo potential stay relatively intact after @xmath341 orbits if @xmath342 . in this respect",
    ", the draco1 model appears to be stable . in the three remaining datasets ( draco2 , sculptor , and carina ; we exclude fornax from this analysis ) , the dm halos of the best fitting models have burkert profiles , with the tidal radii @xmath343 .",
    "burkert satellites are easier to disrupt tidally than nfw satellites , as their binding radius is @xmath344 times larger @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the large inferred value of the tidal radius ( @xmath345 ) makes it very unlikely that the burkert dm halos corresponding to our best fitting models would be completely destroyed by the tidal field of milky way in a hubble time .",
    "we believe that our model is consistent with the observed metallicities of galactic dsphs . as can be seen in fig .  7 of @xcite and fig .  1 of @xcite , the low - luminosity objects we are interested in show a relatively large spread in metallicity ( with a typical value of [ fe / h]@xmath346 ) and no statistically significant correlation between metallicity and luminosity or ( conventionally derived ) virial mass .",
    "the only exception among the galactic dsphs is fornax , which is both the brightest and the most metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath347 , @xcite ) .",
    "as we discussed above , fornax is not well described by our model .",
    "if we relax the single starburst assumption , more massive galaxies can become more metal - rich over time , as they have deeper gravitational potential wells and larger tidal radii , enabling them to reaccrete more metal - enriched gas expelled in the previous episode of star formation .",
    "our model is consistent with the data if the galactic dsphs were formed from a pre - enriched intergalactic medium , with [ fe / h]@xmath348 .",
    "our simple model of stars forming in an extended dm halo from isothermal gas , and later dynamically relaxing after expelling the leftover gas , is consistent with the observed properties of three out of four dsphs studied in this paper .",
    "the results of our simulations suggest that there is an alternative , non - tidal explanation for the observed presence of halos of `` extratidal '' stars around some galactic dsphs . in our model ,",
    "such halos are formed when a freshly formed stellar cluster is relaxed dynamically inside the extended dm halo .",
    "the virial masses of dm halos , inferred from fitting our models to the three dsphs ( draco , sculptor , and carina ) , are in the right range ( @xmath349  m@xmath1 ) to give support to the idea that the galactic dsphs represent the most massive subhalos predicted to orbit in the milky way halo by cosmological @xmath16-body @xmath4cdm simulations , alleviating in this way the `` missing satellites '' problem .",
    "the masses are also large enough to keep a fully ionized ism gravitationally bound , which is an essential ingredient of some models @xcite proposed to explain the complex star formation history of some galactic dsphs .",
    "we would like to thank mark wilkinson and carl walcher for providing the star count profiles for the dsphs , and dean mclaughlin for making his set of theoretical king models available to us .",
    "the @xmath16-body simulations reported in this paper were carried out at the canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics .",
