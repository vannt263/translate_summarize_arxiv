    "the self - similar solutions of relativistic blast waves are of much interest because of their recent applications to the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . a sudden release of a large amount of energy within a small volume results in a strong explosion that drives a relativistic shock into the surrounding medium . at late times",
    "the blast wave approaches a self - similar phase whereby its speed and the distribution of the pressure , density , and velocity of the gas behind the shock front do not depend on the length and time scales of the initial explosion , but only on the explosion energy and the properties of the unshocked external medium .",
    "the self - similar solutions describing this phase have been first studied by blandford and mckee @xcite ( hereafter , bmk ) .",
    "we list their central results , which are relevant to this paper , in section  ii.a .",
    "note that in the bmk solution the total energy released in the explosion @xmath2 is the only relevant parameter .",
    "the bmk solution is only valid for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the power - law index of the radial density profile of the external medium , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 , the similarity variable defined by blandford and mckee @xcite is no longer appropriate . even in the range @xmath7 , the validity of the bmk solution",
    "is not justified , because the mass contained behind the shock front diverges if the density profile of the shocked fluid is described by the bmk solution .",
    "the self - similar solutions for steep density profiles with a power - law index @xmath6 were derived recently by best & sari @xcite .",
    "the derivation of these solutions is similar to that in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "the self - similar solutions to a non - relativistic blast wave were discovered independently by sedov @xcite , von neumann @xcite , and taylor @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` sedov - von neumann - taylor blast wave '' solutions exist only for @xmath8 , but waxman & shvarts @xcite showed that in the range @xmath9 these solutions fail to describe the asymptotic flow because the energy diverges ; instead they found second - type self - similar solutions for @xmath10 as well as for @xmath11 . the new class of non - relativistic , self - similar solutions describe the flow in a limited spatial region @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the shock radius and @xmath14 coincides with a @xmath15 characteristic so that the flow inside the region @xmath16 does not affect the flow in the outer self - similar region .",
    "the self - similar solution has to cross the sonic line into the region where the @xmath15 characteristic can not catch - up with the shock front .",
    "the solution describes a shock accelerating with a temporal dependence whose power - law index is uniquely determined by requiring that the self - similar solution cross the sonic line at a singular point .",
    "note that in these second - type self - similar solutions the total energy released in the explosion @xmath2 is not a relevant parameter .",
    "although the energy in the self - similar part of the flow approaches a constant as time diverges , the fraction of the explosion energy @xmath2 carried by the self - similar component depends on the details of the initial conditions .",
    "thus , contrary to the bmk case , dimensional arguments can not be used to determine the power - law index of the temporal dependence .",
    "instead , the singular point determines the temporal power - law index . in the ultra - relativistic regime , the second - type self - similar solutions for @xmath6",
    "can similarly be obtained by requiring that they cross the sonic line at a singular point .",
    "best & sari @xcite found that these self - similar solutions exist for @xmath17 and describe accelerating shock waves .",
    "however , the properties of the flow in the self - similar region , such as the energy and mass contained in the region , were not discussed .    in this paper",
    ", we rederive the self - similar solutions of ultra - relativistic blast waves for @xmath18 using a different self - similar variable and discuss the properties of the flow in the self - similar regime .",
    "our main goal is to study the _ stability _ of these self - similar solutions .",
    "the stability of the waxman - shvarts self - similar solutions in the non - relativistic regime was studied by sari , waxman & shvarts @xcite .",
    "they found that shocks accelerating at a rate larger than a critical value and corresponding to solutions that diverge in finite time , are unstable for small and intermediate wavenumbers .",
    "shocks that accelerate at a rate smaller than the critical rate are stable for most wavenumbers .",
    "the acceleration rate can be quantified by the measure @xmath19 , where the dots denote time derivatives and @xmath13 is the radius of the shock front .",
    "this measure provides the fractional change of the velocity over a characteristic time scale for evolution ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "solutions that diverge in finite time have @xmath21 while others have @xmath22 .",
    "thus , when shocks accelerate sufficiently fast they become unstable .    in the following sections we study the stability of the self - similar solutions of ultra - relativistic blast waves for steep density profiles with a power - law index @xmath18 . the self - similar solutions",
    "are described in  ii .",
    "we list the bmk solutions for @xmath3 in  ii.a and derive the self - similar solutions for @xmath18 in  ii.b . in  iii , we discuss the properties of the self - similar flow and calculate the energy and mass contained in the self - similar regime . in ",
    "iv and  v , we study the stability of the self - similar solutions .",
    "finally , we summarize our main results in  vi .",
    "for pedagogical reasons , we first briefly outline the derivation of the self - similar solutions of relativistic blast waves for @xmath3 by blandford & mckee . for a complete derivation",

    "assuming an ultra - relativistic equation of state , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pressure and energy density measured in the fluid frame , the equations describing a relativistic , spherically - symmetric , perfect fluid can be written as , @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density as measured in the laboratory frame , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the lorentz factor and velocity of the fluid , and @xmath32 is the convective derivative . throughout this paper",
    "we set the speed of light @xmath33 to unity . assuming that the blast wave is ultra - relativistic so that the lorentz factor of the shock front @xmath34 and the shocked fluid @xmath30 are much larger than unity",

    "the effective thickness of the blast wave is approximately @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius of the shock front .",
    "thus an appropriate choice of similarity variable is @xmath39 next we assume that the external medium has a scale - free , power - law density profile @xmath5 .",
    "ignoring radiative losses , the total energy contained in the shocked fluid remains constant and so the lorentz factor of the shock front evolves adiabatically as a power law , @xmath40 keeping only terms up to order @xmath41 , the shock radius is then given by @xmath42 .",

    "we assume that the unskocked external medium is cold , so that @xmath49 equals the energy density @xmath51 .",
    "the jump conditions for a strong ultra - relativistic shock are satisfied by the boundary conditions @xmath52 for an adiabatic impulsive blast wave , equations ( [ eq : fluideqn1])([eq : fluideqn3 ] ) admit a simple analytical solution , first derived by bmk @xcite",

    "when @xmath58 , the similarity variable @xmath44 defined in equation ( [ eq : defchi ] ) ( and used by best & sari @xcite ) could be negative .",

    "this equation for @xmath38 with @xmath58 differs from equation ( [ eq : rbmk ] ) by a constant @xmath65 .",
    "however , we can choose the initial time @xmath60 such that @xmath65 is equal to zero .",
    "this is appropriate because of two reasons .",
    "first , the self - similar solutions are valid at much later times @xmath66 , thus the effect of the special choice of @xmath60 can be ignored .",
    "second , what matters in the derivation of the self - similar solutions is the derivative of @xmath38 , instead of @xmath38 itself . when @xmath67 , the similarity variable becomes @xmath68 .",

    "similarly to equations ( [ eq : p_defbmk])([eq : n_defbmk ] ) , we write the pressure , velocity , and density in the shocked fluid as @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the boundary conditions , @xmath73 correspond to the jump conditions for a strong ultra - relativistic shock .",
