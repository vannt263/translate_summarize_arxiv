    "reaction - diffusion systems have attracted considerable interest in the past few years @xcite . while at sufficiently high spatial dimensions their critical behaviour is correctly described by mean field rate equations , at dimensions below the upper critical dimension , where the effect of fluctuations becomes important this approach is not valid anymore . in this case one",
    "has to resort to other methods as , for instance , field theory @xcite , exact calculations via bethe ansatz @xcite , monte carlo and cellular automaton simulations ( see @xcite and references therein ) or exact diagonalization techniques @xcite .",
    "recently other types of approaches have been proposed as the density matrix renormalization group @xcite and the standard real - space renormalization group @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the critical properties of a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion model where the local dynamics is given by the following rules .",
    "consider a single species of particles ( @xmath4 ) on an one - dimensional lattice .",
    "each lattice site can be either occupied by a single particle or be empty .",
    "a single particle may hop to an empty neighbouring site ( diffusion ) .",
    "two particles on neighbouring sites can either annihilate ( @xmath5 ) or give birth to a new particle ( @xmath6 ) in the case that one of the sites next to the couple is empty .",
    "the reaction rates for these processes are defined in equations ( [ 2ato3a],[2ato0],[a0to0a ] ) below .",
    "recently , howard and tuber @xcite discussed a generalized version of the above model where @xmath7 particles may be created through the reaction @xmath8 , and with an arbitrary number of particles per site .",
    "they employed a field - theoretical approach and found that the theory is not renormalizable .",
    "they argued , however , that for all @xmath7 the model should not be in the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "their conjecture is based on the analysis of the associated master equation and on the massless nature of the field theory which is at odds with a phase transition of dp type .",
    "however , the critical behaviour of the system , i.e. its universality class , remained unknown . in absence of diffusion , with at most one particle per site , the @xmath9 case is the pair contact process ( pcp ) , where the steady - state phase transition belongs to the dp universality class @xcite .    here",
    "we present a non - perturbative study of the model corresponding to the @xmath9 case of @xcite : the pcp model with additional single - particle diffusion , as obtained from density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations .",
    "the dmrg was introduced by white @xcite in 1992 to investigate numerically ground state properties of quantum spin chains .",
    "because of its great accuracy , reliability and the possibility of treating large systems with a limited computational effort , the dmrg  has since been applied to an ever increasing set of problems , as reviewed in @xcite . in particular",
    ", some recent studies were devoted to the application of the dmrg  to non - hermitian problems @xcite which appear frequently in many domains of physics , for example in low - temperature thermodynamics of spin chains and ladders , for models of the non - integer quantum hall effect and in one - dimensional non - equilibrium systems .",
    "reaction - diffusion systems belong to the latter class of models .",
    "new insight should be expected from the application of the dmrg   to them @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : mod ] we define the model and recall some facts about reaction  diffusion systems . in section [ sec : shf ] we introduce a shift strategy to project out a trivial ground state from the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "this improves the convergence of the dmrg .",
    "the method works if an exact expression for the eigenstate is available . in section [ sec : pd ] we discuss the calculation of the critical points and exponents for the model and show that the model does not belong to the dp universality class .",
    "section [ sec : dis ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath10 with open boundary conditions , as usual in dmrg   calculations @xcite .",
    "the reactions occur with the following rates @xmath11 and are parametrized by the diffusion constant @xmath12 and the pair annihilation rate @xmath13 .",
    "this defines the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) model .    for a first qualitative overview , we consider the mean field kinetic equations . to discuss the effects of diffusion we need the kinetic equations in the _ pair approximation _ , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "if @xmath14 is the spatially averaged single particle density and @xmath15 the spatially averaged pair density , we find @xmath16    in the @xmath17 limit , non - trivial steady states only occur for @xmath18 and one recovers the single - site kinetic equation ( rescaling time by a factor @xmath19 ) @xmath20 which expresses that particles may only be created on empty sites .",
    "the time - dependence of @xmath21 for @xmath22 large is @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a constant which depends on the initial conditions . at small @xmath13 , where the creation process ( [ 2ato3a ] ) dominates , the system is in the _ active _ phase with a non - vanishing particle density in the steady state . on the other hand , for @xmath13 large ,",
    "the pair annihilation process ( [ 2ato0 ] ) dominates , the steady state particle density is zero and the system is in the _ inactive _ phase . in the entire inactive phase , and not only at the critical point , the approach towards the steady state is algebraic , rather than exponential as found in most systems .",
    "the same kind of result also holds in the pair approximation with @xmath28 . in the steady state",
    ", we have @xmath29 .",
    "the particle density vanishes along the curve @xmath30 close to the criticality , the particle density @xmath31 , which is the same found from @xmath32 in the @xmath33 limit above .",
    "however , the pair density @xmath34 there should thus be different universality classes on both sides of the meeting ( `` tricritical '' ) point @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 imply modified critical exponents .",
    "the leading long - time behaviour along the critical line @xmath39 is as follows @xmath40 while @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the entire inactive phase @xmath43 . in the active phase",
    ", the steady state is approached exponentially .",
    "although generally believed to be qualitatively correct in sufficiently high dimensions @xcite , kinetic equations can not provide correct values of the exponents ( and often not even the order of the transition ) in low dimensions . in one dimension ,",
    "the exact decay in the inactive phase is @xmath44 @xcite , where the exponent @xmath45 is that of the process @xmath46 model @xcite , which is recovered taking the limit @xmath47 in the rates ( [ 2ato3a ] ) and ( [ 2ato0 ] ) .",
    "however , the pair approximation suggests the presence of distinct universality classes for @xmath12 large and @xmath12 small .",
    "in addition , the exponent of the time - dependence of @xmath21 for @xmath12 large equals @xmath45 as found exactly for one - dimensional diffusion .",
    "this suggests that the upper critical dimension @xmath48 for that transition should be unity , see @xcite , but the value of @xmath48 in the pcpd is not yet known .",
    "to what extent are the predictions of the pair approximation , in particular the existence of several distinct universality classes along the transition line , borne out ?    an active state with a finite density of particles can be maintained only in the limit @xmath49 . on a finite lattice",
    "any configuration of particles will decay towards an absorbing configuration in a finite time .",
    "there are _ two _ possible absorbing configurations which the system can not leave : ( i ) the empty lattice and ( ii ) a lattice occupied by one single diffusing particle .",
    "if we take @xmath50 , we recover the pair contact process ( pcp ) introduced by jensen @xcite . in that case , any particle configuration without nearest - neighbour pairs is absorbing .",
    "the number of absorbing states grows exponentially with the chain length @xmath10 and it is given by the fibonacci number ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the steady - state properties of the @xmath50 phase transition between the active and inactive phases are described by the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical properties of this transition are more subtle and still under active investigation @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the presence of single - particle diffusion changes the universality class of the transition between the active and inactive phases : for any finite values of @xmath12 it does not fall in the dp universality class anymore .",
    "long ago , janssen and grassberger @xcite conjectured that a model with a continuous phase transition from a fluctuating active phase into a phase with a single absorbing state and without additional symmetries is in the dp universality class . while it is widely believed that in the presence of local symmetries in the reaction rates there should be a different universality class ( normally the pc if the particle number is locally conserved modulo 2 ) , park and park @xcite provided a counterexample which shows that even in the presence of local symmetries the steady - state transition can be in the dp universality class",
    "this already indicates that the universality classification might be more subtle than previously thought .",
    "the exponents we want to compare with are ( see @xcite ) @xmath51 and are defined as usual from the density @xmath52 and the spatial and temporal correlation lengths @xmath53 , see also section iv .",
    "the stochastic time evolution of the system is determined by the master equation , cast into the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 a state vector and @xmath56 is referred to as `` quantum '' hamiltonian . for a chain with @xmath10 sites , @xmath56 is a stochastic @xmath57 matrix with elements @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the state vectors of the particle configurations @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the transition rates .",
    "since @xmath56 is non - hermitian , it has distinct left and right eigenvectors .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath63 , @xmath64 , ",
    ", @xmath65 ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ,  , @xmath68 ) for the right ( left ) eigenvectors of @xmath56 corresponding to energy levels @xmath69 , @xmath70 ,  , @xmath71 ordered according to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the real part .",
    "one has @xmath74 if @xmath75 and we normalize the states in such a way that @xmath76 .",
    "steady states are right eigenvectors of @xmath56 with zero eigenvalue .",
    "the two absorbing configurations mentioned above are steady states and given by @xmath77 thus , @xmath56 has two zero eigenvalues @xmath78 , while @xmath79 is the inverse relaxation time towards the steady state .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath56 is stochastic , @xmath80 is a left eigenvector of @xmath56 with zero eigenvalue .    the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath56 , from which we will derive the critical properties of the model ,",
    "is performed by the dmrg   algorithm @xcite adapted to non - hermitian matrices , as described in detail in @xcite . in section",
    "iii we present a further improvement to deal with systems with degenerate ground states .",
    "a severe numerical problem is generated by the fact that the physically relevant eigenstate , the first excited state , is only the third state in the spectrum due to the double degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "asymmetric diagonalization algorithms for large sparse matrices are much less robust than their counterparts for symmetric matrices , making a precise determination of eigenvalues not at the extreme ends of the spectrum much more demanding . in particular , the precision of the eigenstates suffers .",
    "this in turn leads to a lower quality truncation of the state space in the dmrg   algorithm and subsequently to further deterioration of the results for longer chains . in the present case ,",
    "the dmrg   becomes unstable for rather short chain lengths ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we alleviate this problem successfully by projecting out one of the two ground states , for which both the left and right eigenstate are known , as given in eqs .",
    "( [ def0l],[def0r ] ) .",
    "all _ non - degenerate _ eigenstates of the asymmetric hamiltonian @xmath56 obey a biorthogonality condition .",
    "this leaves us with two options to eliminate one ground state : ( i ) each diagonalization algorithm for large matrices ( arnoldi or lanczs ) generates a sequence of ( bi)orthogonal trial vectors , such that the requested eigenstate can be written as a linear combination of those . during the generation",
    ", one may enforce orthogonality of all these trial vectors with respect to the ground state .",
    "this option does not exist if one uses a black box routine .",
    "( ii ) one may directly modify the hamiltonian shifting the ground state to an arbitrarily high energy , i.e. working with @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a positive number larger than the energy gap of @xmath56 .",
    "this new hamiltonian is not stochastic , however it has the same spectrum as @xmath56 apart from one of the ground states which is shifted to an energy level @xmath83 .",
    "the gap can now be obtained from the first excited state of @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure can also be implemented for a stochastic hamiltonian with a single ground state .",
    "the gap is then obtained from the ground state energy of @xmath84 .",
    "this option can always be used independently of the diagonalization method employed , see @xcite in relation with the power method .    to implement both options , one has to write down the left and right ground states in the transformed block bases generated by the dmrg  .",
    "let us denote for a block of length @xmath10 by @xmath85 the state with no particles and by @xmath86 the sum over all states of a block ( i.e.  in the complete , unreduced hilbert space of the block ) . in the reduced block basis @xmath87 produced by the dmrg   we have approximately @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the right and left ground eigenstates then read @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 run over single site states .    at the beginning of the dmrg   application , the matrix elements @xmath93 and @xmath94 are trivially constructed for a sufficiently small @xmath10 such that the hilbert space has less then @xmath95 states , the number of states kept .    using @xmath96 and @xmath97 and @xmath98 one finds as recursive relation @xmath99 the matrix elements @xmath100 are from the incomplete basis transformation @xmath101 .",
    "numerical implementation of both approaches reveals that the second approach is numerically very stable , while the first one is not , at least not if one carries out an unsophisticated gram - schmidt orthogonalisation .",
    "we suppose that this is due to the fact that global orthogonality of the trial vectors is numerically not exactly conserved by the diagonalization algorithms , while gram - schmidt assumes this when a new trial vector is added and made orthogonal to the ground state .",
    "to find @xmath102 , we have chosen as density matrix @xmath103 denotes the partial trace on the states of the left or right side of the chain .",
    "it is essential to target also the ground state @xmath104 projected out to maintain a good description of the ground state via ( [ eq : trafo1 ] ) and ( [ eq : trafo2 ] ) after some dmrg   steps .",
    "otherwise , the hamiltonian still contains a small perturbing contribution from the zero - energy ground state , which might destroy the stability of the procedure .",
    "we are interested in the lowest energy gap @xmath105 whose finite - size scaling behaviour contains the desired information about the critical properties of the pcpd model ( [ 2ato3a],[2ato0],[a0to0a ] ) . while in principle",
    "the eigenvalues of the ( non - symmetric ) matrix @xmath56 may have a non - zero imaginary part , we always found that @xmath106 is real .",
    "generically , we expect the following finite - size behaviour of @xmath107 @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 the spatial correlation length . at a continuous transition",
    "this diverges as @xmath111 , while in the time direction @xmath112 .    the first line in ( [ eq : gapskal ] )",
    "indicates that on a finite lattice , the relaxation towards the absorbing configurations is very slow .",
    "indeed , for @xmath113 the relaxation time @xmath114 becomes infinite and a state with a finite density of particles becomes a steady state of the system . from the third line in ( [ eq : gapskal ] ) we see that in the entire inactive phase the scaling behaviour of the energy gap is algebraic , with an exponent equal to @xmath115 , as for the pair - annihilation model @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in addition of the obvious double degeneracy of the ground state , we find that our model is gapless in the large - system limit , @xmath116 , for _ all _ values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 ( in most systems the gap is finite in the inactive phase ) .",

    "we point out , however , that the value of @xmath121 at its maximum _ can not _ be used to infer the value of the exponent @xmath125 . only after @xmath126",
    "is determined for the @xmath127 lattice , we can use ( [ eq : ymaxval ] ) to find @xmath125 .",

    "we also recall that the relaxation in the inactive phase is algebraic : all known models @xcite in the pc class are characterized by an algebraic relaxation in the inactive phase with exponents @xmath140 and @xmath173 , as for the pcpd model .",
    "therefore , it might be tempting to speculate that the active - inactive transition of the pcpd model were in the pc universality class .    on the other side",
    "all known models in the pc universality class are characterized by some conservation laws either on the parity of the number of particles or by an exact symmetry between the absorbing states @xcite .",
    "such local consevation laws are however lacking for the pcpd model , which suggests that the pcpd model should not be in the pc class .",
    "it should be also stressed that the unambigous identification of a steady - state universality class requires the determination of _ four _ independent exponents , see @xcite , while our techniques provided values for only two .    in summary , we have used the dmrg method to find the steady - state phase diagram of the pcpd model .",
    "single particle diffusion is a relevant perturbation for the system since the model does not show a dp behaviour as in the limit of vanishing diffusion constant .",
    "some exponent values along the active - inactive transition line are surprisingly close to those of the pc universality class . however , it is conceivable that the near coincidence of the exponents with those of the pc class might be accidental . in that case",
    "the transition(s ) would belong to a universality class distinct form both dp and pc .",
    "it is not yet clear whether in the @xmath199 pcpd there are two distinct transitions , as suggested by pair mean field theory , or merely a single one .",
    "all in all , complementary studies would be needed to fully understand the remarkably subtle behaviour of this so simple - looking model . + * note added : * after this paper was submitted , hinrichsen @xcite performed a monte carlo study of the pcpd for @xmath200 .",
    "the time - dependent density @xmath201 is characterized by the exponent @xmath202 .",
    "he finds @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "this agrees with our table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "after this paper was accepted , we also received a paper by dor @xcite which studies the pcpd through monte carlo simulations and the coherent anomaly method .",
    "in particular , for @xmath205 , dor finds @xmath206 and for @xmath128 and @xmath207 , @xmath208 .",
    "the first result compares well with our results from table [ tab : param ] , which gives @xmath206 and agrees with the result of hinrichsen @xcite .",
    "however , dor also finds @xmath209 for @xmath210 , consistent with the upper bound @xmath211 reported in @xcite .",

    "for @xmath50 , the model reduces to the pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite . in this case , all configurations of the type @xmath213 , without nearest neighbour particles are absorbing and stationary states .",
    "we find the number @xmath214 of absorbing states in the pcp for a chain of length @xmath10 with free ( periodic ) boundary conditions .    for _ free _ boundary conditions , one has the recursion @xmath215 to see this , concentrate on the leftmost site .",

    "if it is empty , one considers the open chain of the remaining @xmath217 sites .",

    "the number @xmath230 of absorbing states for a chain of @xmath10 sites is @xmath231 for @xmath10 large the asymptotic behaviour is @xmath232 .",
    "another example of a kinetic model with exponentially many absorbing states is an adsorption - desorption model of @xmath233-mers ( @xmath234 ) on a @xmath199 lattice where the number of absorbing states is described by generalised fibonacci numbers @xcite .",
    "we discuss the finite - size scaling of the lowest gap @xmath235 and how to localize the critical point . for simplicity",
    ", we suppress the dependence on @xmath12 and write the scaling form @xmath236 where @xmath237 is assumed to be continously differentiable . for the gap , one expects the behaviour @xmath238 where @xmath239 are constants independent of @xmath10 . here , case n refers to the `` normal '' case of non - critical phases on both sides of the transition at @xmath240 and case c alludes to the case of a critical phase on one side and we have already set the exponent equal to 2 in view eq .",
    "( [ eq : gapskal ] ) valid for our model .",
    "this implies for the scaling function @xmath165 @xmath241 where @xmath4 is a positive constant .",
    "since @xmath165 is positive , it follows that in the case c with @xmath242 , @xmath165 must have a maximum at some finite value @xmath243 . for the case",
