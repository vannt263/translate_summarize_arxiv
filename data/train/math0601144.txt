    "a contact structure @xmath0 on a 3-manifold @xmath1 is a ( maximally ) nonintegrable 2-plane field distribution . in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is oriented and @xmath0 is the kernel of a global 1-form @xmath2 which satisfies @xmath3 .",
    "( such a contact structure is often called _",
    "coorientable_. ) although @xmath0 is locally @xmath4 by a classical theorem of pfaff - darboux and hence has _ no local geometry _ , the global study of contact structures is rather complicated , in a way that echoes the intricacies of symplectic geometry .",
    "one of the fundamental questions is to determine @xmath5 of the space @xmath6 of contact 2-plane fields on @xmath1  this is often called the `` classification '' of contact structures on @xmath1 .",
    "the work of bennequin  @xcite ( later clarified by eliashberg  @xcite ) indicated that contact structures , in dimension three , come in two flavors : _ tight _ and _ overtwisted_. we define an _ overtwisted disk _ to be an embedded disk @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 .",
    "an overtwisted contact structure is one which admits an _ overtwisted disk _ , whereas a tight contact structure is one which does not .",
    "what bennequin showed is that the local model @xmath10 is tight  hence locally every contact structure is tight , although globally it may not be .",
    "( showing that a contact structure is tight is highly nontrivial , because one must show that _ no _ overtwisted disk exists , no matter how complicated the embedding ! ) let @xmath11 be the space of overtwisted contact 2-plane fields on @xmath1 and @xmath12 be the space of tight contact 2-plane fields on @xmath1 .",
    "eliashberg showed in @xcite that @xmath13 is the same as the homotopy classes of 2-plane fields on @xmath1 .",
    "the space of tight contact structures , on the other hand , is more intimately related to the topology of @xmath1 .",
    "eliashberg @xcite gave the first classification result for tight contact structures , namely that @xmath14 is connected .",
    "the analysis of tight contact structures on various 3-manifolds has become more manageable in recent years , with the introduction of _ convex surfaces _ by giroux  @xcite and _ bypasses _ by the author  @xcite .",
    "the world of tight contact structures , as we understand it now , is a veritable zoo !",
    "two important subcategories of tight contact structures are the _ weakly symplectically fillable _ ones and the _ stein fillable _ ones . in the former case",
    ", @xmath15 bounds a symplectic 4-manifold @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the latter",
    ", @xmath15 bounds a stein domain @xmath18 and @xmath19 on @xmath1 for a contact 1-form @xmath2 that defines @xmath0 .",
    "fillable contact structures ( of either type ) are tight by a theorem of gromov  @xcite and eliashberg  @xcite ; this was proved using gromov s theory of @xmath20-holomorphic curves .",
    "prototypical examples of weakly symplectically fillable contact structures are the perturbations of taut codimension 1 foliations , as explained in eliashberg - thurston  @xcite .",
    "etnyre and author  @xcite showed that there exist tight contact structures which are not weakly symplectically fillable .",
    "other examples were later obtained by lisca - stipsicz  @xcite .",
    "eliashberg  @xcite showed that there are weakly symplectically fillable contact structures on the 3-torus @xmath21 which are not stein fillable .",
    "further examples were given on torus bundles by ding - geiges  @xcite .",
    "@xmath22    it is known that not every 3-manifold admits a tight contact structure .",
    "etnyre and the author  @xcite showed that the poincar homology sphere with orientation opposite to the one induced on the link of an algebraic singularity has no tight contact structure .",
    "lisca and stipsicz  @xcite have since shown that the poincar homology sphere can be incorporated into a larger class of small seifert fibered spaces which do not admit tight contact structures .",
    "since all these examples of 3-manifolds without tight contact structures are seifert fibered , it is natural to ask whether tight contact structures exist on all hyperbolic 3-manifolds .",
    "it turns out that _ universally tight _",
    "contact structures , i.e. , contact structures @xmath0 on @xmath1 that pull back to tight contact structures on the universal cover of @xmath1 , do not always exist on hyperbolic 3-manifolds  @xcite .",
    "compare this to foliation theory where roberts - shareshian - stein  @xcite have shown that there are infinitely many hyperbolic 3-manifolds which do not admit reebless codimension 1 foliations .",
    "there is related work of calegari - dunfield  @xcite and fenley  @xcite , as well as a different approach using seiberg - witten floer homology , due to kronheimer - mrowka - ozsvth - szab  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still conceivable that every hyperbolic 3-manifold has a tight contact structure .",
    "( the weeks manifold  the closed hyperbolic 3-manifold with the smallest known volume  _ does _ have stein fillable contact structures with either orientation .",
    "this can be easily seen by appealing to surgery on the borromean rings as in gompf  @xcite . )",
    "next we turn our attention to the question of classification . for simplicity , assume that @xmath1 is irreducible .",
    "colin  @xcite and kazez , mati and the author  @xcite , independently , have shown that @xmath23 is infinite for a _ toroidal _",
    "3-manifold @xmath1 , namely one which admits an embedded torus for which @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath1 is not toroidal , then @xmath23 is finite by a theorem of colin , giroux and the author  @xcite .",
    "the latter generalizes an earlier theorem , due to kronheimer - mrowka  @xcite , which states that there are finitely many homotopy classes of 2-plane fields which carry symplectically fillable contact structures .",
    "a fundamental advance in contact geometry is the work of giroux  @xcite ( building on earlier work of thurston - winkelnkemper @xcite , bennequin @xcite , eliashberg - gromov @xcite , and torisu @xcite ) , which relates contact structures and open book decompositions .",
    "we briefly summarize this work , and then describe the developments that have taken place since giroux s icm 2002 article  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be a pair consisting of a compact oriented surface @xmath26 with nonempty boundary and a diffeomorphism @xmath27 which restricts to the identity on @xmath28 , and let @xmath29 be a link in a closed oriented 3-manifold @xmath1 .",

    "there is a slight difference  if we do not specify @xmath41 , we are referring to isomorphism classes of open books instead of isotopy classes .",
    "every closed 3-manifold has an open book decomposition , but it is not unique .",
    "one way of obtaining a different open book decomposition of the same manifold is to perform a positive stabilization .",
    "@xmath42 is a _ positive stabilization _ of @xmath25 if @xmath43 is the union of the surface @xmath26 and a band @xmath44 attached along the boundary of @xmath26 ( i.e. , @xmath43 is obtained from @xmath26 by attaching a 1-handle along @xmath28 ) , and @xmath45 is defined as follows .",

    "a contact structure @xmath0 is said to be _ supported _ by the open book decomposition @xmath40 if there is a contact 1-form @xmath2 satisfying the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath53 restricts to a symplectic form on each fiber @xmath54 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath29 is transverse to @xmath0 , and the orientation on @xmath29 given by @xmath2 is the same as the boundary orientation induced from @xmath26 coming from the symplectic structure .",
    "thurston and winkelnkemper @xcite showed that any open book decomposition @xmath40 of @xmath1 supports a contact structure @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the contact planes can be made arbitrarily close to the tangent planes of the pages ( away from the binding ) .",
    "the following result provides a converse ( and more ) , due to giroux  @xcite .",
    "every contact structure @xmath15 on a closed 3-manifold @xmath1 is supported by some open book decomposition @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , two open book decompositions @xmath40 and @xmath55 which support the same contact structure @xmath15 become equivalent after applying a sequence of positive stabilizations to each .",
    "consider a closed 2-form @xmath56 on the contact 3-manifold @xmath15 for which @xmath57 .",

    "the use of open book decompositions enabled eliashberg  @xcite and etnyre  @xcite to construct concave symplectic fillings for any contact 3-manifold @xmath15 together with a dominating 2-form @xmath56 .",

    "@xcite proved that @xmath66 admits a taut foliation @xmath67 ( @xmath68 the foliation of @xmath69 by @xmath70 ) if @xmath29 is not the unknot . by eliashberg - thurston",

    "( we no longer have the need to use the `` semi '' terminology , thanks to eliashberg and etnyre . )",
    "the work of eliashberg and etnyre enabled one to fill both of the components of @xmath80 so that @xmath79 was now embedded in a closed symplectic manifold @xmath81 .",
    "kronheimer and mrowka were then able to appeal to : ( i ) the work by taubes  @xcite on the nontriviality of seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath81 ; ( ii ) the work by feehan and leness ( see  @xcite , for example ) relating the seiberg - witten and donaldson invariants ; ( iii ) a stretching argument in instanton floer homology ; and ( iv ) floer s exact triangle  @xcite for instanton floer homology .",
    "another application of the existence of concave symplectic fillings is progress by etnyre  @xcite on the following problem : given a contact manifold @xmath15 , what is the minimum genus amongst all the pages of open books corresponding to @xmath0 ?",
    "etnyre has shown that many interesting classes of tight contact structures ( among them perturbations of taut foliations ) do not admit planar open book decompositions .",
    "another important application of the open book framework is the definition of the _ contact class _ @xmath82 in the heegaard floer homology of ozsvth - szab @xcite . using open book decompositions , ozsvth and",

    "this area is currently an active area of research , with contributions from ghiggini  @xcite , plamenevskaya  @xcite , etc .",
    "we will now seek to explain the roles of tightness , weak symplectic fillability , and stein fillability in the open book context . except for theorem  [ lpg ] , this is joint work with w.  kazez and g.  mati and further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be a compact oriented surface with nonempty boundary .",

    "we remark that the theorem does not say that _ every _ open book @xmath25 for @xmath15 stein fillable satisfies @xmath91 .",
