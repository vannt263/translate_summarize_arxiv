    "[ fig:4 ] we report the isotherms of the two solutions in the @xmath5 plane as given by our simulations . in both cases we display only the curves that show minima and thus contribute to the calculation of the lms line .",

    "we show the isotherms in the range @xmath39 and the corresponding lms line .",

    "the lms line gradually shifts toward higher densities upon decreasing the temperature . in this case",
    "the only isotherm showing an inflection is the one at @xmath43  k. this inflection spans the density range @xmath47 .    upon comparing the isotherms planes of the two solutions we note that , at high densities , the isotherms of the higher concentration solution are shifted by about 50 mpa toward lower pressures , with respect to the isotherms of the lower concentration solution .",
    "this shift decreases at densities close to the minima of the isotherms and it almost disappears for very low densities .",
    "this behavior of the isotherms is analogous to what found in the comparison between bulk water and the @xmath7 solution .",
    "@xcite a similar pressure shift can be seen also when comparing the @xmath48 and the @xmath7 solutions ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore upon increasing ions concentration the isotherms progressively shift toward lower pressures .    for the @xmath0 solution the lms line in the isotherms plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) is monotonic as already found for bulk water  @xcite , confined water  @xcite and @xmath7 nacl(aq ) .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath1 solution ( fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) it does not decrease on going from the @xmath49  k to the @xmath42  k isotherm .    an important feature of the isotherms planes of the two solutions is the presence of inflections of the low temperature isotherms .",
    "it has been previously shown for bulk water that those inflections in the isotherms are a signature of the approach of the systems to liquid - liquid ( ll ) coexistence .",
    "@xcite as already noted for the @xmath7 solution  @xcite , this behavior is maintained in the nacl(aq ) .",
    "therefore we can infer that the hdl / ldl coexistence , possibly terminating in a second critical point , is present in the nacl(aq ) solutions , at least up to @xmath1 concentration .",
    "nonetheless the shrinkage of the density range of inflections in the isotherms seems to indicate a gradual disappearance of the coexistence upon increasing salt content .",
    "these findings are consistent with what found by archer and carter  @xcite in their experimental paper .",
    "they found that the anomalous behavior of supercooled water , and in particular the divergence of isobaric specific heat and the existence of a tmd line are maintained in nacl(aq ) up to concentrations of about @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in the framework of the second critical point scenario , it could be proposed that those anomalies are a consequence of a second critical point in the nacl(aq ) system , shifted toward lower pressures with respect to bulk water .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] the isochores planes of the two solutions are reported .",
    "the isochores are presented along with the lms lines and the tmd lines . for both systems",

    "the minima are obtained by fitting the isochores with fourth degree polynomial functions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we show the isochores in the range @xmath51 , the lms line and the tmd line for the @xmath0 solution .",
    "the range of temperatures spanned is @xmath52 .",
    "all the isochores above @xmath41 display a minimum , while the @xmath41 isochore is almost completely coincident with the lms line .",
    "such lms line is entirely in the region of negative pressure and it is nonre - entrant down to the lowest temperature we simulated .",
    "this behavior has been already found in bulk water  @xcite , confined water  @xcite and @xmath7 nacl(aq ) .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] the isochores in the range @xmath53 , the lms line and the tmd line for the @xmath54 solution are displayed .",

    "the isochores above the @xmath55 show a minimum . at this concentration",
    "some oscillations can be found in the lms line at low temperatures .",
    "this line approximately follows the trend found for the @xmath41 isochore .",
    "the comparison of the two isochores planes shows that also the isochores of the @xmath1 solution are shifted toward lower pressures by roughly 50 mpa , with respect to the @xmath0 solution , as already noted for the isotherms of the systems .",
    "this pressure shift decreases at low densities and at @xmath56 it almost vanishes .    in order to have a direct comparison of the two aqueous solutions studied here with both bulk water and the @xmath7 solution",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] the isochores for bulk water , @xmath7 , @xmath48 and @xmath1 solutions in the temperature range @xmath57 and for densities @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this picture",
    "it is more evident that the increase in concentration leads to a downward pressure shift of the corresponding isochores .",
    "this shift is quite consistent at high densities while it tends to reduce at low densities , close to the lms line .",
    "to best show the overall packing of the isochores upon increasing salt content in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we show the blow - up of the @xmath6 plane in the temperature range @xmath60 for all systems in the same density range . on going from bulk water to the @xmath1 solution we observe a decrease by about 50% of the spanned range of pressures .",
    "it has been previously observed in the literature that at constant pressure , ions have an effect on the structure of liquid water equivalent to the application of an external pressure .",
    "@xcite this effect is consistent with our findings since we see that the bulk isochores at a certain density coincide with higher density isochores of the aqueous solution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we show the comparison of tmd and lms lines in the @xmath6 plane among different systems : the two solutions studied in the present paper , the @xmath7 nacl(aq ) and bulk water  @xcite and tip4p water confined in a hydrophobic environment of soft spheres .",
    "@xcite the temperature range spanned here is @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the lms line appears not to be significantly affected by the presence of ions . for the @xmath7 and the @xmath48 solutions the lms line is almost identical to the bulk lms . only at the highest concentration , @xmath1",
    ", it shows minor differences . in the case of water in hydrophobic matrix , which behaves similarly to a solution of small apolar solutes  @xcite , the lms line is similar in shape to that of bulk water and nacl(aq ) solutions but presents a significant shift , circa 200 mpa , in the direction of higher pressures due to excluded volume effects caused by the strong solute solvent repulsive strength .    at variance with the lms line",
    ", the tmd line is markedly influenced by the presence of ions . upon increasing concentration , in fact",
    ", it shifts to lower temperatures and pressures .",
    "moreover in all our solutions the tmd line extends to lower densities with respect to bulk water .",
    "also the shape is modified by the ions and this effect appears to be influenced by concentration .",
    "for the @xmath7 solution the tmd line is much broader than for bulk water . for the @xmath48 and the @xmath1 solutions , the tmd narrows , remaining broader than that of bulk water . in the case of the hydrophobic solute",
    ", the tmd line is broadened with respect to bulk water in a way similar to the case of @xmath7 nacl(aq ) , but it is shifted by roughly 200 mpa ( upwards ) in pressure and 40  k ( to the left ) in temperature with respect to the bulk .",
    "a similar shift in temperature was found also by kumar _",
    "_ in tip5p water confined between hydrophobic plates",
    ".  @xcite    now we further inquire on the possibility of a ll coexistence in our solutions . in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] we show the potential ( or configurational ) energy per molecule of the two solutions , @xmath61 , at @xmath43  k , as a function of the density . for both solutions",
    ", @xmath61 shows two minima . for the @xmath48 solution ,",
    "these minima are in correspondence with densities @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for the @xmath1 solution , minima can be found in correspondence with densities @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the existence of minima in the potential energy as a function of the density , at low temperatures , can be related to the presence of ldl / hdl coexistence , as shown by kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for water in hydrophobic confinement at @xmath42  k. therefore the presence of two minima in the potential energy , at low temperature , in our solutions confirms the indication of the existence of a ll coexistence inferred from the inflections of low temperatures isotherms that we observed .    we can thus infer that , up to the highest concentration we studied , the anomalous behavior of supercooled water is maintained in the nacl(aq ) solutions .",
    "the presence of the ions does not seem to hinder the mechanism of emergence of this anomalous behavior . on the other hand",
    "the shift and the packing in the thermodynamic plane and the gradual weakening of the inflection in the isotherms , upon increasing salt content , are signatures of a progressive disappearance of the anomalies for higher concentrations of ions .",
    "we performed md simulations on two sodium chloride aqueous solutions in tip4p water , with concentrations @xmath0 and @xmath1 , extending our previous work on bulk water and @xmath7 nacl(aq ) .",
    "@xcite using the simulated state points , we drew the isotherms and the isochores planes of the systems .",
    "the analysis of those planes allowed the determination of the lms line and of the tmd line , respectively .    by comparing the results obtained for the solutions studied here and in previous work",
    ", we can observe that the presence of minima in the isotherms , determining the presence of a lms line , is preserved in all the nacl(aq ) solutions analyzed .",
    "importantly , also the inflections for low temperatures isotherms , at high densities , are maintained in the solutions .",
    "nonetheless , they become less pronounced upon increasing concentration .",
    "as previously shown for bulk water  @xcite , those inflections signal the presence of phase coexistence between ldl and hdl in the systems .",
    "being the ll coexistence still present up to the highest concentration we studied , we can hypothesize that whether a second critical point exists for bulk water , it is preserved in the nacl(aq ) solution .",
    "also the existence of a tmd line , determined by the presence of minima in the isochores plane , is maintained in the nacl(aq ) solutions .",
    "experimental results have shown that the tmd at ambient pressure is still present for a @xmath66 solution and disappears for @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite in our results we note that the minima of the isochores become less pronounced for the @xmath1 solution and correspondingly the tmd narrows .",
    "although the overall thermodynamic behavior of the nacl(aq ) solution is similar to that of bulk water , some differences can be noted .",
    "in fact , for densities high with respect to the lms line , both the isotherms and the isochores shift to lower pressures upon increasing concentration .",
    "this behavior results in a significant packing of the curves , as it is particularly evident in the isochores plane .",
    "the difference of pressure between the highest density isochore and the lms line is in fact much broader in bulk water than in solutions and it is reduced upon increasing concentration . the lms line is not influenced by the presence of ions .",
    "in fact both the position in the @xmath6 plane and the shape remains similar to bulk water , with some minor differences appearing for the highest concentration studied .",
    "the tmd line is instead modified in shape and shifted toward lower pressures and temperatures upon increasing concentration .    the results for the lms line and tmd line were also compared to those for water confined in a hydrophobic environment of soft spheres .",
    "@xcite for this system the lms line is similar in shape to that of bulk water but it is shifted to higher pressures .",
    "the tmd line is instead similar to that of @xmath7 nacl(aq ) in shape but it is shifted to higher pressures and lower temperatures .",
    "the existence of two minima in the curves of the potential energy as function of density indicates that ll coexistence is present in the the nacl(aq ) solutions studied here , in analogy with what found for water confined between two hydrophobic plates .",
    "@xcite this result strengthen the hypothesis of a ll coexistence deduced from the observation of inflections in the low temperature isotherms .",
    "we note on passing that signatures of ll coexistence have been experimentally found in licl(aq ) solutions .",
    "@xcite    we have shown that various anomalous features of supercooled water are preserved in aqueous solutions of sodium chloride up to the highest concentration investigated .",
    "interestingly the tmd can be even followed down to lower densities with respect to bulk . from the thermodynamic",
    "features investigated we hypothesize that the ll critical point would be slightly shifted in temperature and more markedly shifted in pressure with respect to bulk water .",
    "therefore an experimental observation of the ll critical point in aqueous solutions , for which crystallization is more easily avoided than in the bulk phase  @xcite , could be possible .",
