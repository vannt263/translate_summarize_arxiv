    "the study of hadron showers ( jets ) started at the lep and tevatron experiments and have been continued at rhic ( bnl ) and lhc ( cern ) . during the last two decades these experiments focused on electron - positron ( @xmath2 ) and proton-(anti)proton ( @xmath0 , @xmath3 ) collisions .",
    "various methods of jet - identification have been tested successfully .",
    "investigating jets in high energy hadron - hadron collisions can provide an understanding of the complex physics of strong interaction and even theories beyond the standard model .",
    "recent state - of - the - art analysis techniques  @xcite reached the point to able to analyze the inner structure of jets , surrounding area of hadron showers , off - jet directions in nucleon - nucleon , and jet - matter interaction in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "these latter studies are connected to the research of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which strongly requires the  separation of hard ( perturbative ) and soft ( background ) component of the reactions .",
    "the underlying event ( ue ) was introduced by the cdf collaboration at tevatron energies  @xcite to separate and identify soft ( or semi - hard ) contributions of a high - energy collision .",
    "since multiple jet events were very rare , then ue could represent the remaining hadrons of a @xmath4 collisions , after the leading jet was identified and extracted .",
    "the cdf - definition corresponds to jet identification in one - jet events , where the second jet is assumed to move automatically into the away side .",
    "an improved version of the cdf definition can be applied for multi - jet events , namely introducing surrounding belts ( sb ) around identified jets  @xcite .",
    "the cdf definition of the underlying event is a simple and practical tool , since opens the jet angle acceptances to the maximum : @xmath5 to the near , @xmath5 to the away , and finally @xmath5 for the two transverse regimes called the ue .",
    "moreover , the cdf event geometry can be fixed easily , since the position of the leading jet defines the _ toward region _ , and the _ away region _",
    "will be chosen respectively  @xcite .",
    "thus , hadrons moving to the _ transverse directions _ are assigned to be off - jet , background particles .",
    "the weakness of the cdf - based ue definition is that it assumes a single or back - to - back jet - event situation , which is not always the case at higher energies . in case of multiple jets or jet - matter interaction with secondary collisions the hadron content of the cdf - regions",
    "would mix up .",
    "the question is : how can we identify and separate the proper regions ?",
    "our idea was to improve and develop a new ue definition , which is strongly connected to the identified jets ( excluding all charged particles from all identified jets ) , independent of the number of jets .",
    "moreover , jet - matter - interaction secondaries can be also separated and investigated within the surrounding areas around identified jets . by this method",
    "the study of @xmath0 and @xmath6 collisions can be done in the same framework without major changes in jet - finding parameters .",
    "we introduced a new definition in refs .",
    "@xcite in agreement with the layout of fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf - sb - ue ] , where the left side displays the cdf - based definition , and sb - based ue is plotted on the right side . as it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf - sb - ue ] , the main difference between the two definitions is the multiple application of jet identification with jet - cone angle @xmath7 , and setting an approximate dial - like area , around which concentric bands ( or rings ) are the surrounding belts , denoted by ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath9 ' .",
    "the thickness of @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "one of the aims of sb - based definition is to separate the jet - like particles from the soft ( or semi - hard ) ones .",
    "this can be carried out via a comparison of physical quantities e.g. : ( i ) the average number of hadrons within the defined areas relative to the total event multiplicities , and ( ii ) the transverse momentum distributions of hadrons in the discussed regions .",
    "below we recall the original cdf - based and our new sb - based definitions in order to test the validity of the sb - based definition .",
    "we performed an extended study of an sb - based analysis of a simulated data set for @xmath0 collisions at 7 tev ",
    "similar to which was published in refs .",
    "we have analyzed a data set of 739 500 @xmath0 events generated by pythia  6  @xcite , perugia-0  tune  @xcite .",
    "this sample is similar to the lhc10e14 sample calculated within the alice framework .",
    "the sample was generated with constrained @xmath12 interval @xmath13 $ ] jets are identified by the ua1 method  @xcite , setting @xmath14 . applying the cuts we got 174 452 two - jet events .",
    "for summing up hadron numbers correctly within the selected specific regions , proper determination of the areas is needed . in parallel ,",
    "selected jets identified in the alice tpc s acceptance ( @xmath15 ) must be counted properly as well .",
    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] compares the cdf - based ( _ left _ ) and sb - based ( _ right _ ) definitions applied on @xmath0 collisions at 7 tev center of mass energy . _ upper panels _ present the area averaged charged hadron multiplicities , @xmath16 vs. the number of total multiplicity , @xmath17 . _",
    "lower panels _ display the @xmath18 distribution of selected hadrons in the given regions .    _",
    "upper panels _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] show that area averaged charged hadron multiplicities are quite similar in both definitions . the jet - content areas ( _ blue full squares for near and disks for away sides _ ) clearly characterized by larger average values .",
    "away side ( _ purple full dots _ ) , surrounding belts ( _ open circles and triangles _ ) , and underlying event ( _ pink dots for cdf and orange open crosses for sb _ ) give similar values in both cases in decreasing order . in both cases",
    "the ue has the smallest value proportional to the @xmath17 . in this way",
    "the two definitions give the same result .",
    "the @xmath18 distributions of fluxes for the selected areas are given on the _ lower panels _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : n - vs - ntot ] using the same notations and colors as above . similarly to the _ upper panels _ the distributions are higher for the jet - content areas and getting smaller to the direction of away side , surrounding belts , and underlying event .",
    "it is interesting to see , that for the sb - based case all spectra are almost the same , but the separation of jet - content , sbs , and ue are well defined .",
    "moreover , the shapes of the curves clearly reflect the origin of the hadrons : jet - content distributions are power - law like , but the sbs and ue areas are exponential at lower @xmath18s , indicating the bulk origin of the hadrons found in these areas",
    ".    in summary , the sb - method , especially the @xmath18 distributions of fluxes , gives good separation of the charged hadron yields from different regions and its general use is supporting the of study the properties of ue and any jet - matter interactions inside the sbs .",
