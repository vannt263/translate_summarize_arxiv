    "on the one hand , comprehending the relevance of the mechanisms of ion dynamics will allow the prediction of ionic mobilities , and , on the other hand , the underlying polymer dynamics attains significance due to the coupled nature of the motion of ions and polymer segments .",
    "computer simulations have provided precious insights on the structural aspects as well as the dynamical processes in polymer electrolytes .",
    "the cations of the salt are solvated by atoms or groups located on the polymer host by means of complexation .",
    "this results in a local increase of the friction coefficient of the complexed monomers whereas the uncomplexed monomers are relatively free .",
    "the difference in the dynamics of the complexed and the uncomplexed monomers lead to dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of lithium salt in poly(ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) have shown that the dynamics of oxygen atoms which are bound to a lithium cation ( li@xmath1 ) are slower than those which are free .",

    "the widely studied rouse theory , known to approximately describe the dynamics of linear , unentangled polymers under melt conditions , capture the essence of the dynamical behavior of the segments .",
    "the study of polymer dynamics can be broken down into several dynamical modes with characteristic time and length scales . within the framework of the rouse theory",
    ", each mode corresponds to an eigenvector ( also called normal coordinate ) .",
    "the eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other , i.e. , the different modes are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "knowledge of modes can be employed to calculate the segmental dynamics .",
    "the rouse theory predicts for the segmental msd a dependence of @xmath4 for times @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the rouse time or the longest relaxation time of the polymer .",
    "very recently , it has been shown for peo / libf@xmath0 that it is possible to predict the cationic diffusivity as a function of the microscopic time scales characterising the cation transport mechanisms by considering the coupling of the cationic motion to the segmental dynamics of the polymer .",
    "an important delineation was the description of the ether oxygen ( eo ) dynamics according to the rouse theory , which was verified by comparison against the msd of eo atoms , and particularly to account for the retardation of those monomers which are bound to the li@xmath1 ions .    in this paper",
    "we elucidate the polymer dynamics from microscopic simulations of amorphous peo and peo / libf@xmath0 and check the extent to which the dynamics can indeed be characterized by the rouse model .",
    "furthermore , we present brownian dynamics simulation of a bead - spring model with heterogeneous friction and some stiffness to closely resemble our chemically realistic polymer electrolyte . in this way",
    "we analyze to which degree the dynamic properties of the microscopically complex peo / libf@xmath0 system can be understood from an appropriately chosen bead - spring model .",

    "the two - body effective polarizable force fields employed have been adopted from ref . which were derived from quantum chemistry based techniques .",
    "the simulation methodology and details of the force fields used in this work closely follows that of ref .",
    "coulomb interactions between the partial charges ( ions as well as polymers ) were calculated via the particle - mesh ewald method with a distance cut - off of 10  .",
    "overall charge neutrality of the systems were also maintained .",
    "the simulation box contained 16 chains of peo , with the sequence h-(ch@xmath8-o - ch@xmath8)@xmath9-h , each comprising @xmath10 number of monomers .",
    "all bond lengths were constrained to their equilibrium values by the lincs algorithm .",
    "however , the bend and the dihedral angles of the polymer chains were kept flexible .",
    "the simulations were propagated at a constant temperature of in the canonical ensemble and under the application of periodic boundary condition .",
    "temperature coupling was accomplished using the nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "the average pressure during the runs were of the order of 1 mpa .",
    "equilibration times of the order of @xmath11 had been considered for each of the systems prior to the analysis of the trajectories .",
    "apart from the realistic systems described above , we have also simulated a toy model of a single chain consisting of only beads and springs , characterized by the standard harmonic potential .",
    "we attempt to capture the essential dynamics of the monomers of our realistic polymers through the toy model . to incorporate correlations between the bond vectors",
    "we impose a bending potential such that the total hamiltonian is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the position vector of bead @xmath14 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the force constant of the harmonic springs and the bending constant between the adjacent bond vectors , respectively .",
    "the forces arising from the bending potential essentially model a freely rotating chain ( also see ) .",
    "a value of @xmath17 is chosen , where @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant in reduced units and @xmath19 is the temperature , also in reduced units , used for coupling between the viscous drag and the gaussian white noise , that entails the mean square bond length @xmath20 .",
    "we fix @xmath21 to maintain consistency with the stiffness of the peo chains in the atomistic peo / libf@xmath0 system , yielding a similar value of the characteristic ratio @xmath22 for both the models ; see table 1 .",
    "we construct three different toy systems with system size @xmath10 : ( i ) bd1 : the chain is homogeneous , i.e. all the beads have the same friction coefficient of @xmath23 , and akin to the characteristics of neat peo .",

    "the correlation between adjacent bond vectors measured as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle included between the two adjacent bond vectors , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is consistent between the atomistic systems and the toy models .",
    "for peo , @xmath31 is the angle between the link vectors formed by connecting the ether oxygen atoms consecutively .",
    "the stiffness of the peo chains as measured by @xmath32 is slightly higher in the neat system when compared to peo / libf@xmath0 .",
    "this implies the chains are expanded more for the neat peo than those in the peo / libf@xmath0 system .",
    "alternatively , this is also apparent from the values of the characteristic ratio , @xmath33=@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mean square end to end distance of the polymer chain , @xmath36 is the mean square bond length and @xmath37 is the number of bonds .",
    "note , that in ref .",
    "@xmath38 , for the case of neat peo , because @xmath36 was defined as the mean square length of a skeletal bond .",
    "we consider @xmath36 to be the mean square @xmath39 distance between the adjacent monomers .",
    "the characteristic ratio is not sufficient to describe the chain stiffness because it takes into account only the large scale chain conformations . even though @xmath33 is higher for neat peo when compared to the chains in peo / libf@xmath0 , the chains in the former display faster relaxation ( @xmath40 10 ns ) than those in the electrolyte ( @xmath40 19 ns ) .",
    "this underscores the importance of local stiffness effects arising from dynamic heterogeneities which are difficult to incorporate in analytical models .",
    "structurally , as evident from the @xmath39 radial distribution function ( not shown ) and also from the mean square distance between adjacent oxygen atoms , @xmath36 , there will be slight differences between the peo chains in the two systems in terms of the distribution of the conformational states of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 dihedrals .",

    "similar violations have been reported before for 1,4-polybutadiene and n - c@xmath59h@xmath60 .",

    "the self - similarity of the gaussian coil over a broad length scale is no longer fulfilled .",

    "the presence of cations in the proximity of some monomers leads to a localised shrinking of the affected subparts of the chains .",
    "precisely , the cations enforce a helical like arrangement of the ether oxygen atoms around themselves and thereby further reducing the extent of spatial occupation of a contiguous group of bound monomers .",
    "this is consistent with the reduction in @xmath35 and also supported by the absence of such observations for the highest modes in the bd1 system where there is no torsional potential and non - bonded interactions",

    "an ether oxygen atom is considered to be bound to a li@xmath1 if their separation is less than 3.0 .",
    "we attempt to elucidate the difference in dynamics observed for bound and average ( i.e. both free and bound ) oxygen atoms ( figure 4 ) through the simplified brownian chain models bdra and bdco .",
    "( see text for details ) .",
    "inset : msd of ether oxygen ( eo ) of neat peo ( dots ) ; all eo atoms of peo / libf@xmath0 ( solid ) and eo atoms bound by li@xmath1 during time @xmath83 ( dash ) ; x and y axes are scaled for the sake of comparison against the toy models.[fig4 ] ]    the msd of the average segments and the defects with respect to the center of mass of the polymer chains are shown in figure 4 .",
    "for the bdra as well as the bdco , at short times , when the particles are yet to feel the topological constraints , the difference in the dynamics can be expressed by the statistical factor : g(all segments)/g(defect ) = @xmath84 .",
    "this is in agreement with the data ; see figure 4 .    at intermediate times , the average segment of bdra is seen to lag behind that of the bdco whereas the defect dynamics is slightly faster in case of bdra compared to bdco .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of the average segment and the defects merge with each other , corresponding to the value of @xmath85 , earlier for the bdra than their counterparts for the bdco .",
    "the reason is that for bdra the dynamics of the small-@xmath51 rouse modes quickly gets averaged over the fast and slow monomers .",
    "slow and fast segments exchange their dynamics leading to retardation of the fast ones and acceleration of the slow beads until all segments share the same dynamics .",
    "this process occurs at a faster rate for bdra as the possibility of each defect , on an average , to interact with non - defects is considerably higher than if the defects are spatially correlated .",
    "in contrast , for bdco there exist extended regions of slow monomers which even at intermediate times can continue to move slower than the rest of the chain .",
    "because of slower exchange of dynamics between the slow and fast segments , the process of averaging the segmental motion takes a longer time compared to the bdra .",
    "additionally , we plot the msd of the beads from the homogeneous chain ( bd1 ) .",
    "as expected , these show faster motion compared to the heterogeneous chains . at intermediate times , a time scaling of the msd of the bd1 segments by a factor corresponding to the average friction coefficient of the heterogeneous chain @xmath86 ( 2.8 in figure 4 ) is found to describe the defect dynamics of the bdra chain fairly well .",
    "the dynamics of the eo atoms in the neat peo is displayed in the inset of figure 4 .",
    "also shown for the peo / libf@xmath0 system are the msd of the average eo atoms and a subset of eo atoms that are bound to a li@xmath1 ion during time @xmath83 .",
    "note that the x and the y axes of all the peo - based curves are scaled to match the units of the bd systems to facilitate a comparison .",
    "the oxygen dynamics in the neat peo is significantly faster when compared to the average oxygen and the bound oxygen atoms of the polymer electrolyte .",
    "it can be observed that between @xmath87 and @xmath88 both the curves from the peo / libf@xmath0 system basically agree except for a time scaling with a factor of 2 ( see inset of figure 4 ) .",
    "this time scaling signifies the relative immobilization of the bound oxygen atoms in the electrolyte .",
    "a similar factor of @xmath89 is observed in the bdco toy system between the dynamics of the average segment and the defects in the time range of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus , a representation of the dynamics of the complexed monomers ( or defects ) necessitates an enhancement of the friction coefficients by one order of magnitude ( @xmath92=8 ) to generate a right - shift of the dynamics of the average segments by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "this is also the reason behind choosing a value of @xmath24 as the friction coefficient for the defects in our toy systems .    at intermediate times a time scaling by a factor of 3 relates the eo dynamics in the neat peo to the peo / libf@xmath0 system .",
    "in contrast , a comparison of the average segmental dynamics of the bd1 and bdco yields a factor of 1.4 .",
    "this indicates that a rigorous comparison of eo dynamics in the neat peo and the peo / libf@xmath0 is somewhat hampered owing to the differences in structure as well as the mean square end to end distance ( of @xmath93 ) between the two systems . nevertheless , the dynamics observed in bdco is in qualitative agreement to the dynamics exhibited in the polymer electrolyte system",
    "the polymer dynamics from all - atom simulations of peo and peo / libf@xmath0 are expressed in terms of its normal coordinates or modes .",
    "the orthogonality of the modes holds and is supported by the accurate reproduction of the segmental dynamics of the monomers by taking into account only the autocorrelation functions of the modes and ignoring the presence of cross correlations .",
    "we have compared the findings to the predictions from the rouse theory .",
    "the theoretical segmental dynamics considering only the exponential relaxation of the mode - autocorrelation function agrees with the monomer dynamics in case of peo / libf@xmath0 except for the first 20 ps where the displacements are shorter than the statistical segment length .",
    "the agreement between theory and simulation holds for peo only beyond 100 ps .",
    "this is surprising because one would have expected stronger deviations in case of polymer electrolytes than for neat peo due to additional generation of heterogeneities in the former by the complexed cations . for both peo and",
    "the peo / libf@xmath0 the mode amplitudes show a dependence of @xmath50 only for the first few modes before crossing over to a steeper dependence for high modes where local chemical details start to play , overriding the gaussian self - similarity seen over larger length scales . furthermore ,",
    "both the systems suffer from rising non - exponentiality with increasing mode numbers due to diversity in local environments and arrangement of conformational states .",
    "the violations of both @xmath74 and @xmath65 from the @xmath50 dependence is the cause of the steeper time exponents at intermediate times of the segmental dynamics compared to that predicted from rouse theory .",
    "finally , the effect of the presence of cations in the vicinity of segments augments the friction coefficients of the affected subparts of chain by an order of magnitude .",
    "specifically , the dynamical effects of the heterogeneities when they are confined along the chain in the form of contiguous units is more drastic than when they are distributed over the chain .",
    "nevertheless , the rouse model captures the average behavior of the segmental dynamics in peo / libf@xmath0 quite well .",
    "the dynamics of the bound segments can be obtained via simple time - scaling in the time regime which is relevant for the understanding of the ion dynamics in polymer electrolytes .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge j. baschnagel , o. borodin and m. vogel for helpful and valuable discussions . furthermore , one of the authors ( a.h . ) would like to thank h. w. spiess for sharing his insights into polymer dynamics and dynamic heterogeneities ."
