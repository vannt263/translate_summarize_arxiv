    "the dynamic behavior of granular / porous reactive materials has attracted significant attention due to its possible practical applications : reactive structural components , reactive fragments , etc.@xcite the performance requirements introduce challenging fundamental problems such as combining high strength with ability to undergo controlled bulk disintegration producing small sized reactive fragments .    the material structure which can meet this and other requirements should be tailored and optimized at the mesoscale to produce the desirable mechanical properties while still facilitating the release of chemical energy .",

    "[ fig:12 ] have very different shear band locations and modes of fracture , there are a number of similar characteristics that the samples exhibit .",

    "the same effect can be seen in all areas of the samples in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] where the w particles group in very close proximity to each other .    finally , due to the random nature of the sample , some of the w particles form angular chains with channels of al between them facilitating the growth of shear instabilities and shear bands along the channel . the sample in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] ( b ) exemplifies this with w particles creating a channel structure spanning the entire sample going diagonally from the lower left corner to the upper right corner .",

    "the results showed that a significant reduction of the initial yield stress from al 6061-t6 ( 324 mpa ) to a softer al ( 20 mpa ) increased the amount of bulk distributed damage and plastic strain in the sample in addition to altering the shear band location .",

    "<S> two - dimensional numerical modeling was used to explore the mesomechanics of the large strain dynamic deformation in al - w granular / porous composites and explain the experimentally observed differences in shear localization between composites with various mesostructures . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the bonding between the al particles , the porosity , the roles of the relative particle sizes of al and w , the arrangements of the w particles , and the material properties of al were investigated using numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated in simulations that the bonding between the `` soft '' al particles facilitated shear localization as seen in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations and experiments revealed that the mechanism of the shear localization in granular composites is mainly due to the local high strain flow of `` soft '' al around the `` rigid '' w particles causing localized damage accumulation and subsequent growth of the meso / macro shear bands / cracks . </S>",
    "<S> the `` rigid '' w particles were the major geometrical factor determining the initiation and propagation of `` kinked '' shear bands in the matrix of `` soft '' al particles , leaving some areas free of extensive plastic deformation as observed in experiments and numerical calculations . </S>"
