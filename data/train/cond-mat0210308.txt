    "<S> the equation of state of dense deuterium has been the topic of intense discussions since nova laser shock wave experiments  @xcite measured the hugoniot curve up to megabar pressures in 1997 and predicted an unexpectedly high compressibility . </S>",
    "<S> four years later , knudson _ et@xmath2al . </S>",
    "<S> _ measured a significantly smaller compressibility using magnetically driven flyer plates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this controversy continues to initiate new efforts to determine the eos in different regions of the high temperature phase diagram . in a new approach to reach higher densities , g.w .  </S>",
    "<S> collins and p.  cellier use a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) to precompress samples of liquid deuterium and then launch laser shock into them . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this article is to use path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) results to determine hugoniot curves for precompressed samples in order to make a prediction for comparison with current and future experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the two series of shock wave experiments using the nova laser  @xcite reached pressures of up to 340@xmath2gpa and predicted a 50% higher compressibility than previously estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the results provided the first experimental data in a regime of extreme pressure and temperature , in which our understanding had so far been primarily based on analytical models and computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental findings suggested that standard eos models such as sesame  @xcite were too _ stiff _ , predicting a maximum compression of about 4-fold the initial density . </S>",
    "<S> instead the measured eos was found to be closer to _ softer _ models like  @xcite that predicts a maximum compression ratio of about 6 . </S>",
    "<S> such a difference in the eos of dense hydrogen and deuterium would have significant consequences for our understanding of jovian planets , brown dwarfs , and low mass stars as well as for the design of the inertial confinement fusion strategies .    as a consequence of the publication of the nova measurements , a number of chemical models were developed which incorporated the experimental information directly or indirectly to fit unknown model parameters and then predicted an eos closer to nova experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this is a common strategy used to improve such a complex function as the deuterium eos , which must describe different phases and regimes and spans many orders of magnitude in temperature and pressure . </S>",
    "<S> typically the eos is pieced together from different analytically known limits , experimental data , and computer simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high compressions seen in the predictions of chemical models were not confirmed by first principles simulation techniques such as density functional molecular dynamics  @xcite and pimc  @xcite . both results are in relatively good agreement with each other , predicting a lower compressibility and a hugoniot curve close to that of the sesame model .    in a different series of laser shock wave experiments , mostovych </S>",
    "<S> _ et@xmath2al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite used a reshock technique to probe the eos at higher compressions . </S>",
    "<S> the results were also in better agreement with the soft eos models and differed significantly from _ ab initio _ simulations  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the error bars were larger than those of the nova results .    the controversial discussion of different results changed dramatically with the publication by knudson _ et@xmath2al . _ @xcite . instead of a laser , </S>",
    "<S> the z pulse power machine was used as magnetic drive to accelerate a flyer plate launching a shock into deuterium . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved pressures have not yet exceeded 100 gpa but a different trend in the hugoniot curve can already be identified . </S>",
    "<S> the results clearly predict a significantly lower compressibility , which is in good agreement with _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ simulations and with other stiff eos models . given two different experimental results , </S>",
    "<S> it can be expected that efforts to resolve this discrepancy will intensify . </S>",
    "<S> so far , no satisfactory explanation has been given despite many different attempts to interpret the data . </S>",
    "<S> this also included suggestions for the existence of nonequilibrium states with different temperatures for ions and electrons . </S>",

    "<S> _ @xcite suggested @xmath4 while gygi _ et@xmath2al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite proposed @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the later prediction resulted from a remarkable computational effort involving the first dynamic simulation of shock propagation using the car - parinello method .    </S>",
    "<S> chemical models have been constructed to predict hugoniot curves ranging from 4 and 6-fold compression while _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> simulations , with the exception of wave packet molecular dynamics  @xcite , predict a stiffer hugoniot . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is generally assumed that the final determination of the eos will result from further experimental work . </S>",
    "<S> new efforts are on the way and novel techniques are being developed . </S>",
    "<S> while the principle hugoniot represents only one line in the phase diagram , other methods can probe different densities . </S>",
    "<S> double and multiple shock reverberation measurements can access higher density regimes . </S>",
    "<S> also , a pulse shaping technique is being tested by knudson _ et@xmath2al . _ to generate compression states on an isentrope rather than hugoniot states . </S>",
    "<S> one new way to access higher densities is to use a dac to precompress deuterium before launching a single shock through the diamond into the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows one to choose a different initial state characterized by @xmath6 leading to shock states @xmath7 given by  @xcite , @xmath8 for a given eos , shock velocity @xmath9 and particle velocity @xmath10 can be derived from , @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we use @xmath15 per atom and @xmath16 as used in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that there will be small corrections to the initial state based on the initial pressure and temperature , which can be applied to our results when the initial state of a specific experiment is known . </S>",
    "<S> different initial conditions like @xmath17 , caused primarily by a higher initial temperature , and @xmath18 , from the precompression , shift a particular hugoniot curve characterized by a fixed @xmath19 from density @xmath20 to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the density correction @xmath22 to first order is given by , @xmath23 we expect these corrections to be relatively small compared to the difference between the nova and z - pinch results , which correspond approximately to a difference of 3  ev per atom in the internal energy or to an eos change of @xmath24ev in @xmath25 per atom ( see  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this article is to make a prediction based on pimc simulations for the hugoniot curves in current and future experiments using samples of precompressed liquid deuterium . due to the length restriction for this article </S>",
    "<S> , we can not describe any details of the pimc method , which can be found in  @xcite . also for the eos efforts using pimc simulations , we refer the reader to the literature  @xcite . for this particular calculation , we used eos data published in  @xcite and results from a number of additional simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the precompression in a dac allows one to probe regions of higher density as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase ] and  [ prho ] . </S>",
    "<S> the different curves show predictions based on pimc simulations for different initial compressions . </S>",
    "<S> the densities @xmath26 and 0.30@xmath27 were chosen to approximately represent conditions in a first set of experiments using laser driven shocks in samples precompressed in a dac  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the range of initial pressures and densities is limited by the currently available laser power , which limits the size of diamonds being used and therefore the maximum achievable precompression .     deuterium temperature density phase diagram with principle hugoniot curves calculated from pimc simulations for different initial densities @xmath19 given in the legend in units of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the thin solid lines represent isobars , dash - dotted lines indicate the approximate boundaries of the molecular , the atomic , and the plasma regime.,width=517 ]     pressure density diagram showing hugoniot measurements @xcite and results from chemical model calculations  @xcite starting from the uncompressed liquid deuterium state @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the triangles indicate hugoniot curves from pimc simulations for different initial densities @xmath19 given in the legend in units of g@xmath2@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the thin solid lines are isotherms , the dash - dotted lines represent final shock states generated with the same shock velocity ( @xmath29 and 30 km / s ) starting from different initial compressions.,width=517 ]    the equation of state from our pimc simulations has been used to derive the different hugoniot curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ prho ] . even a relatively small initial compression to @xmath30 yields a maximum final density of 1@xmath27 , which is about 6 times the uncompressed initial density of @xmath31 and also close to the densities predicted by the nova experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is expected that the maximum in compression will be at much higher pressures of about 1500 gpa , which is one order of magnitude higher than the maximum in the uncompressed case , which is estimated to be at 100 to 200 gpa .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase ] shows different hugoniot curves for initial density up to @xmath32 predicting final shock densities of up to @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum compression was always close to 4-fold the initial density . </S>",
    "<S> an unexpected increase in compression similar to the predictions of the nova experiments has not been observed for any initial compression . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the maximum compression ratio actually decreased slightly from 4.3-fold in the uncompressed case to about 4.1-fold for @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen which of the characterized conditions of dense deuterium will be realized in future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the experimental limitation such as the power of the shock drive and the pressures that can be reached in the dac . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the sustainable shock velocity is limited to 30@xmath34 , only pressures up to about 200 gpa can be reached if @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure - density points obtainable at constant shock velocity are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ prho ] . </S>",
    "<S> the locus of those points is very similar to the isotherm of @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> much higher temperatures and pressures can be reached in a shock reverberation measurement using the same initial shock velocity . comparing the precompressed single shock experiment with the double shock experiment using an aluminum back plate </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that an initial compression to @xmath37 leads to a primary hugoniot curve very similar to the secondary hugoniot curve in the double shock experiment ( compare fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase ] and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a fixed primary shock velocity , the states reached in the double shock experiment are at about twice the temperature and 1.8 times the pressure compared to the compressed single shock experiment with @xmath37 using the same primary shock velocity . a more detailed discussion of these curves is expected to follow when the first experimental data become available .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the eos from pimc simulations of dense deuterium has been used to compute shock hugoniot curves for different initial precompressions . </S>",
    "<S> the study makes precise predictions solely based first principles calculations to compare with shock experiments using deuterium samples , which have been precompressed in dacs . </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this work is to provide these curves as a _ reference _ for the interpretation of future experiments as the precompression techniques is further advanced .    </S>",
