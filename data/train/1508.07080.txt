    "after the discovery of higgs particle by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite at lhc , detailed measurements of its property become very important and urgent .",
    "these precision measurements will open up a new opportunity to search for physics beyond standard model .",
    "in particular , heavy particles which can decay into higgs boson are under active experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "scalar top quark ( stop ) , the supersymmetric partner of top quark and the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , is one of such possibilities .",
    "then , stoponia , bound states ( binding through @xmath6 color gauge interaction ) of stop and anti  stop may become interesting provided that stop is long - lived enough to form a bound state .",
    "they can serve as a probe to stop , and decay of stoponium via the stop ",
    "anti stop pair annihilation into diboson states may be observed due to its distinct signature @xcite .    with regard to the production cross section calculation of stoponium , a next - to - leading order computation of perturbative part of",
    "the production cross section is available @xcite and a resummed next - to - next - to - leading logarithm calculation is performed @xcite . turning these perturbative calculations into phenomenological comparisons",
    "requires matrix elements for stoponium . with the observation that heavy quark moves slowly in the rest frame of quarkonium ( @xmath7 in bottomonium and @xmath8 in charmonium where @xmath9 is the heavy quark velocity in the rest frame of quarkonium ) , nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )",
    "is developed and the quarkonium production cross section is given in terms of perturbative parts and nonperturbative matrix elements @xcite .",
    "similarly , the parton - level differential cross section for the stoponium ( @xmath10 ) production in a collider can be given as @xmath11 + x ) \\langle { \\cal",

    ", one can relate the production matrix elements to decay matrix elements by crossing relation in leading order of @xmath17 .",
    "the decay matrix elements then can be related to nonrelativistic wavefunctions in the vacuum saturation approximation upto @xmath20 . for the @xmath2 state stoponium , @xmath21 when the leading @xmath17-order term in the factorization expansion is considered and a stoponium state is assumed to dominate in the intermediate states @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath22 denotes nonrelativistic stop , @xmath23 denotes nonrelativistic anti stop .",
    "this matrix element is related to the wavefunction at the origin @xcite as @xmath24 and has been calculated on lattice for charmonium and bottomonium decays instead of @xmath25 , due to the spin - less nature of stop ] @xcite ( see @xcite for an improved lattice calculation for bottomonium system ) .",
    "so far , potential model estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been used for the stoponium masses and the stoponium wavefunctions where typical bound states properties are summarized in @xmath26 with the mass of the s - wave stoponium state , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the value of stoponium radial wavefunction at the origin . in @xmath29 , uncertainty from the wavefunction at the origin , @xmath28 , is more dominant than that from the mass .",
    "the mass of stoponium will be mostly from twice of the `` free '' stop mass and the `` binding energy '' will be just a few percent in stoponium mass and the uncertainty in binding energy will lead to sub - percent level uncertainty in stoponium mass . on the other hand , @xmath28 depends very much on the functional form of potential models @xcite .",
    "clearly , using potential model estimates for the binding interaction of stoponium is unsatisfactory since it introduces model - dependence which can not be systematically improved , and makes the stoponium cross section calculation unsystematic as a whole , despite the improved perturbative calculations .",
    "furthermore , potential models have a difficulty in obtaining right decay widths for a given state although they do better for relative ratios for different states @xcite .",
    "employing different functional forms for potential models can lead to a large differences .",
    "for example , a potential model estimate for @xmath30 defies a naive expectation that large stop mass ( @xmath31 gev ) would result in coulombic behavior of the wavefunction , and exhibits substantial departure from the coulombic value of @xmath28 even at @xmath32 tev @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there can be sizeable non - perturbative contribution to the bound state properties .",
    "indeed , next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order calculation together with a scheme choice which is less sensitive to the long distance effect of qcd is necessary to understand the threshold behavior of the top anti - top s - wave pair production cross section @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we use lattice formulation of @xmath17 nreft for stoponium and calculate the stoponium mass and a stoponium matrix element , @xmath33 . unlike a potential model calculation , lattice nreft is based on the first principles of quantum field theory and allows systematic study of errors associated with a given result .",
    "this effective lattice theory is similar to the lattice version of nrqcd @xcite which allows highly successful understanding of nonperturbative quarkonium physics ( see e.g. , @xcite ) except for the fact that stop is a spin - less particle .",
    "our calculation for the stoponium property is performed on @xmath34 lattices generated with `` quenched approximation '' and the lattice spacing , @xmath35 gev for the stop mass range @xmath36 ( i.e , @xmath37 gev ) .",
    "a large @xmath38 is necessary to avoid deconfining effects . in the rest frame of stoponium , stop is expected to move slowly with velocity @xmath39 and the size of stoponium should be smaller than those of typical quarkonia ( rough estimate for the size of stoponium may be given by the self - consistency relation , @xmath40 with the size of @xmath41 and the stop mass @xmath42 ) and thus small @xmath43 does not cause a significant finite volume effect .",
    "since the momentum scale larger than the heavy particle mass is `` integrated out '' in nreft and @xmath44 is chosen to be @xmath45 , we need to consider only the lattice spacing scale in lattice nreft for stoponium .",
    "we find that with @xmath46 nreft lagrangian , the lattice result for @xmath3 is factor @xmath4 larger than a potential model estimate in @xcite for @xmath47 .",
    "although further study is necessary ( in particular in view of the difficulty associated with quantifying the systematic uncertainty from the quenched approximation ) , this implies that the stoponium production rate at lhc may be larger than the current estimates based on potential model . in the following ,",
    "we briefly summarize the lattice method used in the calculation of stoponium properties ( section [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "then , we present our main result in sec . [ sec : result ] and conclude with sec . [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the effective lagrangian for nonrelativistic stop in leading order of @xmath17 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath22 is a complex scalar field for stop which transforms as a @xmath6 vector and @xmath49 is that for anti - stop and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are gauge covariant temporal ( spatial ) derivative under the strong interaction , @xmath6 .",
    "note that this leading order nreft lagrangian does not differ from that for nrqcd .",
    "the difference between stoponium nreft lagrangian and nrqcd lagrangian occurs only when next - to - leading order nreft lagrangian is considered since the spin interaction ( e.g. , @xmath52 ) in nrqcd is @xmath20 .",
    "additional terms for nreft lagrangian in @xmath53 can be systematically studied by including    @xmath54 + c_2 \\frac{ig}{8m^2}\\left[\\psi^\\dagger \\left({\\mathbf d}\\cdot{\\mathbf e } -    { \\mathbf e}\\cdot{\\mathbf d}\\right ) \\psi + \\chi^\\dagger \\left({\\mathbf      d}\\cdot { \\mathbf e } - { \\mathbf e}\\cdot{\\mathbf d } \\right ) \\chi \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as for the monte carlo data of @xmath6 lattice gauge fields which are used in the calculation , they are generated on @xmath0 lattice in `` quenched approximation '' at lattice bare coupling @xmath55 using a single plaquette wilson action .",
    "multi - hit metropolis algorithm together with interleaving over - relaxation algorithm @xcite is used for the gauge field update .",
    "each configuration is separated by 1000 monte carlo sweeps . to convert a lattice result into a quantity in a physical unit",
    ", one needs a lattice spacing as a function of the bare coupling constant . in the scaling limit",
    "( @xmath56 due to quenched approximation ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we use the light hadron spectrum calculation in @xcite to set the lattice scale since the experimental value for @xmath60 level splitting used in usual quenched lattice quarkonium calculations is not available for stoponium . in @xcite , at @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 gev ( @xmath64 mev ) from the lattice @xmath65 and @xmath66 mev .",
    "this scale setting introduces @xmath67 systematic error and the ambiguity due to the quenched approximation in the scale setting is far larger .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for the question of the scale setting in bottomonium system ) ] .",
    "thus , the scale for @xmath68 is set as @xmath69 .    under the background of these lattice gauge field configurations , nonrelativistic stop correlators for @xmath46",
    "are calculated using the evolution equation , @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes an appropriate complex valued random point source , diagonal in @xmath6 color ( random source improves the signal to noise ratio ) , and @xmath72 is the lattice hamiltonian corresponding to eq . and @xmath73 is the time directional gauge field .",
    "the parameter , @xmath74 is introduced to stabilize large momentum behavior of the lattice discretized evolution equation ( see table [ tab : meanfield ] for the choice of @xmath74 ) .",
    "the gauge link variables are divided by `` tadpole factor '' , @xmath75 , which is chosen to be @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a plaquette . for @xmath20 lagrangian , a modified evolution equation which includes the hamiltonian for eq .",
    "together with the improvement term for finite lattice spacing @xcite can be used such as @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the lattice @xmath53 hamiltonian mentioned in the above .    the zero - momentum stoponium correlators are then formed by combining the green function for stop and that for anti stop and are summed over the spatial lattice sites . from the stoponium correlators ,",
    "matrix elements are obtained by fitting @xmath80 for the lattice determination of the wave - function at the origin , @xmath81 , the matrix element obtained from fitting eq .",
    "is related to the nonrelativistic coulomb - gauge fixed wave - function @xmath82 in the leading order of @xmath17 with the normalization convention for the radial wavefunction , @xmath83 @xcite .    in nreft formulation ,",
    "the energy scale in the spectrum is not known . in order to determine the mass of a state from the energy of state for a given channel from eq .",
    ", `` energy shift '' needs to be determined , @xmath84 where the mass of state , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 denotes the quantum number of the state ) , is given in term of the energy of the state ( @xmath87 ) , `` zero point energy ( @xmath88 ) '' , and the mass renormalization ( @xmath89 ) @xcite ( or one can use the kinetic mass of nonrelativistic dispersion relation to determine the mass of a state @xcite ) . in lattice nrqcd study of charmonium and bottomonium , this energy shift is determined either by the well measured experimental mass for one of the states ( such as @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) or by lattice perturbation theory computation @xcite .",
    "stoponium is not discovered yet and the perturbative estimate for the energy shift using the lattice action used in this work is not calculated .",
    "thus , we use tadpole improved mean field estimate for the energy shift in leading order @xcite , where @xmath92 , \\;\\;\\ ;",
    "z_m = u_0^{-1 } \\left(1 - \\frac{a h_0}{2k } \\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath93 @xmath14 is the integer parameter which is introduced in eq .",
    "to prevent the high momentum instability of the evolution equation . at @xmath94 ,",
    "monte carlo simulation gives @xmath95 .",
    "perturbatively , @xmath96 @xcite and @xmath97 at @xmath68 .",
    ".mean field estimates of the zero energy shift [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as discussed , in this work stop mass is not tuned and a mean field estimate of the zero energy shift is used . these two aspects are related to each other since tuning amounts to changing lattice stop mass until the kinetic mass in the nonrelativistic dispersion relation is equal to the mass of the a given state where part of the `` correct mass '' is from the zero energy shift , @xmath98 . however",
    ", tuning stop mass imprecisely is not a big source of systematic error .",
    "for example , in a bottomonium study @xcite , the difference between a properly tuned bottom quark mass , @xmath99 and a rough estimate , @xmath100 ( using @xmath101 gev @xcite and the lattice spacing @xmath102 fm ) is consistent compared with the accuracy of our calculation . from table [ tab : meanfield ] , one observes that the mean field estimate for the mass renormalization effect is small ( @xmath103 ) at @xmath104 and the variation in @xmath105 due to change of @xmath106 is @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore the difference between the leading order perturbative estimate for the tadpole factor @xmath75 and the monte carlo estimate is @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the mean field estimates themselves must be close to the perturbative estimates for each quantity .",
    "nreft lagrangian is an infinite series expansion in @xmath17 which upto @xmath20 is given in eq .",
    "each term other than the kinetic term ( eq . ) comes with effective couplings and radiative corrections to these coefficients gives series expansions of @xmath112 as @xmath113 for @xmath114 and are expected to be less than @xmath115 since @xmath116 for @xmath117",
    "similarly , the discretization error due to the finite lattice spacing must be small since the magnitude of the improvement terms which correct for the finite lattice spacing effect of the spatial derivative ( @xmath118 ) and the temporal derivative ( @xmath119 ) are small .",
    "estimating effects of the quenched approximation on the matrix element is difficult . in the bottomonium case , the comparison of s - wave function at the origin from the dynamical simulation @xcite and that from the quenched simulation @xcite using leading order nrqcd lagrangian found that the matrix element from the quenched approximation underestimates by @xmath120 since the distance scale associated with the bottomonium bound state ( @xmath121 ) is larger than the scale at which the matrix elements sample the wave function ( @xmath122 ) .    in the lattice calculation of the matrix elements ,",
    "the factorization scale is related to the lattice cutoff and the effective cutoff is affected by the specific form of the lattice action and the evolution equation of lattice green s functions @xcite .",
    "such an effect needs to be studied if we are interested in the lattice matrix elements beyond the leading order of nonrelativistic expansion .",
    "also , since the matrix element in table [ tab : lattice_result_v2 ] is actually a lattice matrix element , one needs to calculate perturbative matching coefficients between the lattice regularization scheme and a continuum regularization scheme which is used for the parton level cross section ( e.g. , @xmath123 ) to obtain continuum matrix elements . in this leading order nreft",
    "lagrangian study , the matching is not performed .",
    "however , since @xmath112 is small , we expect that renormalization effect will be small .",
    "under the assumption that stop is long - lived enough to form bound states , stoponium plays an important role in the study of stop and offers an interesting probe to stop searches @xcite . in this case ,",
    "nonperturbative quantity , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the mass of @xmath2 state of stoponium and @xmath126 is the radial part of the wavefunction at the origin , naturally appear in the study of productions and decays of stoponium .",
    "thus far , a potential model estimate for @xmath127 is used in phenomenological investigations of stoponium , which is unsuitable for improved perturbative calculations .    in this work , using lattice nonrelativistic formulation for heavy stop which is interacting through the strong interaction , we calculate the mass of s - wave stoponium and the stoponium matrix element relevant for stop ",
    "anti stop annihilation decay , where this matrix element is related to @xmath128 in nreft scheme .",
    "compared to potential model studies , lattice study of stoponium is advantageous in that a particular functional form of the potential between stop and anti stop needs not be assumed and errors associated with a lattice calculation can be systematically studied and improved .",
    "monte carlo samples of @xmath6 color gauge field at @xmath68 ( @xmath129 ) on @xmath0 lattices ( which is generated in quenched approximation with multi - hit metropolis / over - relaxation algorithm ) is used for lattice calculation .",
    "table [ tab : lattice_result_v2 ] and fig .",
    "[ matrix ] summarizes the lattice result for the @xmath2 stoponium mass and the lattice matrix element for @xmath127 with @xmath130 nreft lagrangian . in general , the lattice @xmath127 is factor @xmath4 larger than a potential model estimate of @xcite for @xmath131 .",
    "the difference between the lattice result and the potential model result is larger at lighter @xmath125 and becomes smaller at heavier @xmath125 .",
    "according to this trend , the lattice result may approach coulombic behavior of the wavefunction at heavier @xmath132 although upto @xmath133 gev the lattice result is still far from reaching coulombic limit .",
    "@xmath134 , the energy of @xmath2 state of stoponium ranges from @xmath135 gev ( @xmath136 ) to @xmath137 gev ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "upto @xmath17 order , toponium is equivalent to stoponium except the spin degeneracy and the result in table [ tab : lattice_result_v2 ] is equally applicable to toponium since the spin - flip term in nrqcd is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "although further studies on systematic effects in our lattice result is necessary , factor @xmath4 larger @xmath127 implies an enhanced stoponium production cross section in hadron colliders such as lhc and can have interesting consequences for stop search in hadron colliders .",
    "therefore , we hope to study stoponium using @xmath6 lattice gauge fields which includes vacuum polarization effect of light dynamical quark and improve the above result using @xmath20 nreft lagrangian in the future . for a next - to - leading order nreft lagrangian study , other matrix elements",
    "which are higher order in @xmath17 is also needed and the perturbative matching mentioned in the above needs to be performed . since excited states of s - wave stoponium will contribute to the production cross section",
