    "measuring the evolution of the sfr density of the universe as a function of look - back time is essential to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath1 luminosity is one of the best optical estimators of the current sfr , modulo the initial mass function ( e.g. , kennicutt 1992 , 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath1 can only be observed with optical ccds out to @xmath7 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the @xmath03727 line is frequently used as a sfr estimator due to its availability in optical spectroscopic samples . however , the transformation between the number of ionising photons ( which is a direct consequence of the current sfr ) and the intensity or equivalent width ( @xmath8 ) of this line is strongly dependent on the excitation conditions and metallicity .",
    "previous empirical calibrations of the sfr in terms of the line ( e.g. , gallagher , bushouse , & hunter 1989 ; kennicutt 1992 ; guzmn et al .",
    "1997 ) vary within a factor of a few . among other problems",
    ", these calibrations may suffer from small number statistics , incompleteness in luminosities , starburst ages and/or physical conditions of their samples , and uncertain extinction corrections .",
    "we have analysed the emission line properties of a local sample of h@xmath1-selected star forming galaxies ( the ucm sample ) and derived reasonably precise empirical calibrations between the and h@xmath1 luminosities as a function of the galaxy population properties . in a recent paper , jansen ,",
    "franx & fabricant ( 2001 ) carried out a similar study for the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs , jansen et al .",
    "2000a , b ) and found , among other things , that the observed /h@xmath1 ratio varies by a factor of  7 at luminosities near @xmath9 , and that the /h@xmath1 ratio is inversely correlated with luminosity .",
    "our study is , in many ways , complementary of that of jansen et al . , but we use an h@xmath1-selected ( thus sfr - selected ) sample of galaxies instead of a @xmath3-band selected one .",
    "we confirm most of the findings of jansen et al . , but we also demonstrate that using an extra piece of information , namely the @xmath8 of , much of the scatter in the /h@xmath1 ratio can be removed , allowing a much more accurate calibration of vs.sfr .",
    "our basic dataset comes from universidad complutense de madrid ( ucm ) survey of h@xmath1 selected galaxies .",
    "optical spectroscopy ( gallego et al .  1996 ; 1997 ) and optical and near - infrared photometry ( prez - gonzlez et al . 2000 , 2002 ; gil de paz et al .",
    "2000 ) are available for this sample . based on their spectroscopic properties ,",
    "the ucm galaxies have been roughly divided into two main classes : hii - like and disk - like galaxies ( see gil de paz et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we will compare the properties of the ucm galaxies with those of the nfgs galaxies of jansen et al .",
    "a detailed description of our study can be found in aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "we assume @xmath10km@xmath11s@xmath12mpc@xmath13 throughout .",
    "in figure  1 we plot the @xmath14}}/{\\rm h}\\alpha$ ] ratio ( both observed and corrected from extinction using the balmer decrement}}^0 $ ] and @xmath15 indicate extinction - corrected emission - line fluxes . ] ) for the ucm and nfgs galaxies as a function of absolute @xmath3- and @xmath4-band magnitudes and @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "there is a large scatter in the @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha}$ ] and @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratios for all the galaxies , but the scatter in the extinction - corrected @xmath2}}^0/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratio is considerably smaller , indicating that much of this scatter is due to differences in extinction .",
    "figure  1 also reveals significant difference in the median @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha}$ ] and @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratios for the ucm and nfgs galaxies .",
    "these ratios are considerably smaller for the ucm galaxies . however , the extinction - corrected @xmath2}^0}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratios for both samples agree quite well , indicating that the line ratio differences between both samples are mainly due to a difference in the mean extinction .",
    "this is readily explained by the fact that the nfgs sample has been selected in the @xmath3-band , while the ucm sample was selected in the red ( h@xmath1 ) , and thus it is not surprising that galaxies with higher extinction are underrepresented in the blue selected sample .",
    "therefore , differences in sample selection can yield very large differences in the line emission properties .",
    "the third conclusion from these plots is that the @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha}$ ] and @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratios for disk - like and hii - like galaxies are very different .",
    "however , the average @xmath6}^0}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratio is the same for both classes of galaxies .",
    "again , the mixture of galaxy types in a given sample can have large effects in the line ratios .",
    "we also find that , although with significant scatter , the @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha}$ ] and @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratios are reasonably well correlated with the absolute @xmath3- and @xmath4-band magnitudes and with @xmath18}})$ ] .",
    "however , the extinction - corrected @xmath2}^0}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha^0}$ ] ratio is largely independent of these quantities , indicating that extinction is the main driver of these correlations .",
    "this is supported by figure  2 , which shows quite reasonable correlations between the extinction and the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies .",
    "the extinction is also correlated with @xmath5}})$ ] .",
    "this figure also shows that the typical extinction for the nfgs galaxies is significantly smaller than for the ucm galaxies .",
    "these correlations could allow us to statistically predict  with varying degrees of accuracy  the observed and even extinction - corrected h@xmath1 fluxes from the observed flux using the information contained in the @xmath5}})$ ] and/or the absolute magnitudes , provided that the sample selection effects are correctly taken into account .",
    "indeed , it is very important to stress that these correlations apply , strictly speaking , to samples with similar properties to the ones presented here .",
    "if the selection of the sample is different , significant systematics could be present , as shown by the differences in behavior between the ucm and the nfgs galaxies .",
    "moreover , there is no guarantee that high redshift galaxy samples would not show significant evolution in their line ratios ( e.g. , due to chemical evolution ) which could , in principle , invalidate any locally - derived calibration .",
    "any calibration derived from these empirical correlations would have a significant intrinsic scatter , and thus the predictions for individual galaxies will be quite uncertain",
    ". however , if one is only interested in statistical properties of large samples ( e.g. , determining the star - formation rate density of large regions of the universe ) , the problem of the large scatter would be alleviated .",
    "but it is crucial to take into account the properties of the sample , in particular the selection criteria , luminosity range and mixture of galaxy types , since important systematic effects are also present on top of the large scatter .",
    "obviously , just using large samples would not solve the systematic problems .",
    "finally , there is another problem we have not discussed and needs to be considered : the effect of galaxies with no emission on the statistical determination of sfrs and sfr densities .",
    "a significant fraction of the ucm galaxies ( 20% ) have h@xmath1 emission but no detectable emission ( @xmath5}}>-5\\,$] ) .",
    "this means that by only counting the emitting ucm galaxies , we would miss @xmath19% of the extinction - corrected h@xmath1 flux , i.e. , @xmath19% of the sfr .",
    "this problem becomes negligible for a blue - selected sample such as the nfgs since , due mainly to its lower average extinction , virtually all nfgs galaxies with h@xmath1 emission have detectable .",

    "_ kennicutt : _ i was surprised by the large shift in @xmath2}}/{{\\rm h}\\alpha}$ ] ratio between your ucm disk galaxy sample and the nfgs objects because my impression was that the types of galaxies were similar ( despite the different selection methods ) .",
