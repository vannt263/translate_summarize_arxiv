    "the impressive development of nanoscience places the detailed understanding of quantum transport in mesoscopic systems among the main challenges of condensed matter physics .",
    "a rich variety of devices and structures , including simple metallic wires , as well as complex molecules , where electrons are driven by some external force , are the subject of experimental and theoretical investigation",
    ". the driving field can be established by attached leads at different chemical potentials , a magnetic flux when the system is bended into a ring or time - dependent fields .",
    "transport properties , like the conductance of the system , depend strongly on its microscopic details but they may also depend on the underlying driving mechanism .",
    "a simple quasi one - dimensional annular system threaded by a magnetic flux is one of the paradigmatic devices to discuss the fundamentals of quantum effects dominating the electron transport .",
    "several outstanding experiments @xcite and theoretical works @xcite have been devoted to the investigation of phenomena related to the aharanov - bohm effect in rings enclosing a static magnetic field .",
    "there is , however , relatively less literature related to the case where the field changes in time . among the latter category of problems",
    ", a very interesting example corresponds to that of a magnetic flux with a linear dependence on time : @xmath0 , which induces a constant electric field along the ring .",
    "this problem was discussed by bttiker , imry and landauer in the early times of the theory of quantum transport @xcite . their motivation was to search alternative schemes to calculate the conductance of a system to that proposed by landauer @xcite , where the sample is placed between two reservoirs at different chemical potentials . as first discussed in that seminal work , such device isolated from the external world ,",
    "is not appropriate to observe a dc - current since the electrons inside move coherently displaying bloch oscillations and producing a pure ac - response . in a subsequent work landauer and bttiker",
    "@xcite showed that when a dissipative mechanism is added to that system a dc - current is established .",
    "bttiker also showed that a concrete element to introduce inelastic scattering events and dissipation is a lead connecting the loop to a particle reservoir @xcite .",
    "soon later , lenstra and van haeringen suggested that a dc - current can be generated in that device by elastic scattering introduced by weak disorder @xcite . the possibility of `` resistive '' behavior originated in pure elastic scattering processes generated a series of interesting discussions and criticisms @xcite .",
    "most of the ideas of these works are based on adiabatic descriptions where the energy levels of the ring define minibands in a parametric representation as periodic functions of the flux .",
    "within that adiabatic framework , scattering processes form small gaps between the so defined minibands while the time dependence of the field gives rise to zener tunneling across them . in refs .",
    "@xcite interesting arguments emphasizing the concept of localization in the energy space as a consequence of disorder have been proposed against the possibility of dc - response without dissipation .",
    "the discussion of the role of dissipative effects in the driven ring was introduced on the basis of a phenomenological equation of motion that describes the relaxation via inelastic scattering processes ( isp ) of the time - dependent occupation of a miniband @xcite .",
    "the main argument was that the dc - response should vanish in the limit of vanishing and strong relaxation , while it should peak at some intermediate regime . for small electric fields , the behavior of the current",
    "is also found to follow a linear , ie .",
    "ohmic - like , dependence as a function of the induced electromotive force ( emf ) .",
    "these notable predictions have not been examined in more detail during many years .",
    "quite recently , the effect of inelastic scattering in the dc - behavior of that system has been studied @xcite . in that work a pure `` clean '' system",
    "is considered , ( ie without any kind of elastic scattering ) .",
    "non - ohmic behavior has been found in the dc - current vs emf characteristic curve within the limit of small isp , while the dc - current is found to decrease continuously as the strength of the isp increases .",
    "the fact that no tendency towards a vanishing component of the dc - current is observed as the dissipation tends to be suppressed is rather surprising , since the limit of pure bloch oscillations in the isolated system seems not to be recovered .    in this work",
    "we consider a ring threaded by a flux with a linear time dependence and we analyze in detail the role of dissipation in that system .",
    "we study the clean one - band system as well as the effect of two different kinds of elastic scattering processes : a periodic potential with a two - sublattice profile and a random potential .",
    "the effect of inelastic scattering is modeled by means of the coupling to a particle reservoir through an external lead .",
    "we use a recently proposed theoretical treatment based on baym - kadanoff - keldysh green functions @xcite which enables a full out - of - equilibrium description of the time - dependent problem , without introducing any kind of adiabatic assumptions or approximations . as far as no many - body interactions are considered",
    ", that treatment leads to the exact solution of this problem .",
    "thus , one of the aims of this work is to analyze the case of the disordered driven ring in the limit of weak isp , which has focused several efforts but has never been tackled with an exact method .",
    "the formalism based on green functions is particularly appealing to deal with the coupling to external leads and reservoirs .",
    "these elements can be introduced by means of physical models and they can be concisely represented by self - energies , avoiding further assumptions about the boundary conditions .",
    "we consider two different electronic models for the lead : one is described by a constant density of states and a very wide band , while the other is represented by a semi - infinite tight - binding chain .",
    "we show that the dc - response does not depend qualitatively on the latter details . in all the cases ,",
    "our results indicate that the dc - current tends to a vanishing value as the coupling to the reservoir goes to zero , displays a maximum and then decreases as that coupling becomes stronger . for clean systems ,",
    "the position of the maximum shifts towards very low isp strengths as the emf decreases and as the length of the ring increases .",
    "the system considered here , actually lies in the category of the so called _ ratchet _ problems , since the induced electric field by itself is not able to produce a dc - response , needing the aid of some additional rectification mechanism .",
    "this motivates the analysis of the transport properties of this system in the framework of recent symmetry arguments proposed to examine rectification processes in ratchet systems in the presence of time - periodic fields @xcite .",
    "such arguments provide further support to the idea that dissipation is an essential ingredient for this system to have a dc - current irrespectively the particular nature of the elastic scattering along its circumference .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and the theoretical approach to analyze the behavior of the current . in section",
    "iii we present the results .",
    "section iv is devoted to summary and conclusions .",

    "the full system is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 where the first term , representing the ring , depends explicitly on time due to the presence of the time - dependent flux .",
    "we consider noninteracting spinless electrons described by a tight binding model with @xmath3 sites and lattice constant @xmath4 .",

    "the term @xmath12 describes the reservoir .",

    "the last term of @xmath16 , @xmath17 represents the connection between the ring and the reservoir .      in refs .",
    "@xcite an interesting connection has been suggested between the rectification properties of the system and the underlying symmetries of the equations of motion in several ratchet problems .",
    "the main idea is that the symmetries of the equation of motion that change the sign of the velocity would lead to a vanishing dc - component of the current .",
    "we now turn to follow the lines suggested in those works to carry out a similar symmetry analysis in our problem .",

    "this section is devoted to analyze the behavior of the dc - current ( [ curdc ] ) as a function of the induced emf @xmath68 , the strength of isp and the chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "the strength of isp is related to the degree of coupling between the ring and the reservoir . in the case of the wide band model , the parameter @xmath78 sets that measure . in the model with a semicircular density of states ,",
    "that measure is given by @xmath79 .",

    "a wide band model was assumed for the reservoir in these calculations .",
    "the dc - current displays a maximum which shifts to lower values of @xmath78 as @xmath68 decreases . at low @xmath78 ,",

    ", the dc - current remains linear within a wide range of @xmath68 while for weak coupling , the departure from linear response takes place at small @xmath68 .    to study the origin of this peculiar behavior we must analyze the structure of the equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) . at each time",
    "@xmath59 , the green function @xmath91 contains a combination of a large number of @xmath92-components ( separated in @xmath96 ) of the green function ( [ a3 ] ) . in the weak coupling limit",
    ", @xmath60 is sizable only within a neighborhood of the @xmath3 frequencies @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , a _",
    "resonant _ combination of components at different frequencies is achieved when @xmath97 , the latter being the mean energy separation between two eigenenergies , @xmath98 .",
    "whether such interference will be constructive or destructive and give rise to a large or a small component of the dc - current is a question without obvious answer , particularly in the case of small @xmath68 , where the number of coupled frequencies is very large . on general grounds ,",
    "one expects that such an effect would strongly depend on the underlying symmetries of the model .",
    "related discussions have been recently presented in problems of pumping introduced by microwave fields @xcite where the floquet representation of the wave function is used , leading to a structure of the solution containing a mixing of frequencies that differ in the frequency of the pumping field . in our problem , it becomes apparent that such interference is constructive regarding the magnitude of @xmath95 and for this reason , in the weak coupling limit , the current grows linearly as a function of @xmath68 , reaching a maximum at @xmath99 .",
    "the decrease for @xmath100 can be understood by noting that the number of resonances is approximately @xmath101 , becoming smaller as @xmath68 increases .",
    "the maximum of @xmath95 as function of @xmath78 can be also interpreted in terms of combination of components of the green function from different frequencies .",
    "in fact , the effect of increasing isp is to spread the spectral weight of the peaks of @xmath102 .",
    "thus , for strong coupling the interference involves a large number of frequencies but with a low ( approximately constant ) weight . for lower isp , the amplitudes can be large for frequencies close to @xmath63 but tend to be vanishingly small in between .",
    "the result is that there is a maximum in @xmath95 at some strength of isp that seems to scale as @xmath103 , at least , within the regime @xmath104 . on the side of strong coupling , where the resonant effects are highly smoothed ,",
    "the resulting dc - current is relatively smaller ( consistent with the idea that resistance increases with isp ) and behaves linearly within a larger range of @xmath68 .",
    "the effect of the length of the chain is also analyzed in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the first issue to note is that in the @xmath105 sites ring ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "1 , the dc - current for @xmath106 remains growing for the smallest @xmath78 considered . instead , for @xmath107 and the same parameters , the current decreases down from its maximum ( cf upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the picture of constructive resonances : the condition @xmath108 is achieved in this case at lower @xmath68 , while the larger number of peaks increases the probability of resonances and the current remains large , within a larger range of @xmath68 . for larger fields and for larger",
    "@xmath78 , the qualitative and quantitative behavior is essentially the same as that observed in the smaller ring .",
    "regarding the effect of the model for the reservoir , it becomes clear from the results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that it does not play any relevant qualitative role since we can identify in these plots the same features observed in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] corresponding to the two highest emfs ( @xmath111 ) , where the decrease to a vanishing @xmath109 can be cleanly captured wihin the shown range of @xmath109 , suggest a @xmath112 behavior as @xmath110 .",
    "this is even more clear in the plot of @xmath113 vs @xmath109 shown in the inset .",
    "this dependence can be understood by noting that when @xmath114 , the retarded green functions entering the evaluation of @xmath115 ( see eq .",
    "[ curt ] ) , can be replaced by the ones for the uncoupled ring ( corresponding to @xmath116 ) .",
    "hence , for small enough @xmath109 , the time - dependent current and also the dc - component @xmath95 become linear in @xmath109 .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite for a linear device pumped with a laser in configurations with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the behavior of @xmath95 as a function of the chemical potential is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that a semicircular shape can be identified in the envelope of these functions . as mentioned before , the density of states of a semi - infinite tight - binding chain of bandwidth @xmath13 , is proportional to a semicircle of radius @xmath14 .",

    "the details of the model used for the reservoir do not influence the final behavior of @xmath129 .",
    "in fact , all the features in the weak coupling regime observed within the wide band model for the reservoir are also obtained with a reservoir with a semicircular density of states ( cf plot in dashed lines of fig .",

    "the effective parameters @xmath129 and @xmath117 do not have any straightforward significance in the context of our original model and the parallel between the driven ring and the dot connected to semi - infinite chains is purely heuristic .",
    "however , it is remarkable the similar behavior of the conductance of the two devices .",
    "it suggests that although the chain that forms the ring is made up by a discrete chain with a finite number of sites , the dressing due to the mixing of a large number of frequencies tend to produce a structure such that any site along the ring would feel as if placed between two semi - infinite leads . in spite of this resemblance ,",
    "the quantitative properties of the conductance are different from the one which would be measured in a landauer device with the chain forming the ring stretched and placed between two reservoirs , as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , neither the effective density of states at the site between the two effective leads nor the hopping element @xmath117 correspond to the configuration of a non - interacting site coupled to two leads through @xmath82 as in the original chain .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of our motivations is to analyze the behavior of the dc - current in a disordered system in order to explore the possibility of ` resistive ' behavior in the limit of vanishing dissipation .",

    "different plots correspond to different fields @xmath144 .",
    "the ones corresponding to the lowest and the highest fields are plotted in thick black and violet lines , respectively.,width=241 ]    as a function of the chemical potential , the dc - current displays fluctuations that become stronger in the strong coupling limit ( see fig .",

    "the fluctuations bear a close resemblance with those observed in the behavior of the conductance of disordered quantum wires @xcite .",
    "a systematic analysis of the probability distribution of conductance @xmath145 defined in ( [ cong ] ) over several disorder realizations as well as the behavior of @xmath145 as a function of the system length is left for the future .",
    "we have studied the transport properties of a dissipative tight - binding ring driven by means of a magnetic flux with a linear dependence in time .",
    "dissipation is introduced by coupling the mesoscopic ring to an external macroscopic system that plays the role of a reservoir of particles and energy .",
    "we have extensively analyzed the behavior of the dc - component of the current along the ring as a function of the strength of dissipation and of the chemical potential of the reservoir for clean chains , chains with a two - band structure and an energy gap and disordered chains .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of the specific model assumed for the reservoir and we conclude that this does not play any relevant role . in the weak coupling regime , the structure of the energy levels of the hamiltonian describing the ring , seems to play a relevant role .",
    "such structure determines the way in which contributions from different frequencies of the green function couple through the pumping term in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) .    in all the cases",
    "we expect a vanishing dc - current in the hamiltonian limit ( vanishing isp ) . for the case of the clean ring , we find that the current exhibits a maximum as a function of the isp strength that seems to scale with @xmath68 .",
    "for small enough @xmath68 this maximum can lye very close to the limit of vanishing isp .",
    "the range of fields where a linear behavior of the dc - current as a function of @xmath68 is observed depends on the strength of isp .",
    "it is wide for strongly coupled systems and very narrow for weakly coupled ones .",
    "remarkably , the behavior of the conductance of the system as a function of the chemical potential can be reproduced with a device consisting in a quantum dot with a constant density of states and two semi - infinite tight - binding chains with the same hopping parameter as the original one , attached to its left and right sides through a very large hopping element .    in the ring with a two - band structure ,",
    "the behavior of the dc - current within each of the two conducting bands is similar to that observed in the one - band case .",
    "however , its magnitude is smaller and at fixed chemical potential and emf , the position of its maximum as a function of the isp strength has a softer dependence with the emf .",
    "an important asymmetry is observed between the behavior of the current within the upper and lower bands , while inelastic scattering is essential to obtain a sizable magnitude of the current through the gap , irrespectively the intensity of the induced emf .",
    "the disordered ring can be seen as the n - band extension of the two - band case .",
    "we have examined some typical realizations of the random potential and observed that as a function of inelastic scattering , the maximum in the dc - current takes place within the intermediate regime , becoming vanishingly small in the limit of weak coupling . as a function of the chemical potential , the current displays fluctuations following patterns that depend on the degree of inelastic scattering .",
    "our results are in agreement with the criteria based on symmetry arguments suggested for ratchet problems @xcite , according to which a dc - component of the current is possible provided that the equations of motion of the system are not invariant under symmetry operations that change the sign of the time - dependent current . in the case of the present problem the only possible symmetry that may introduce such an inversion , is time - reversal .",
    "this symmetry is an exact one in the pure hamiltonian limit where the ring is isolated from the reservoir but it is immediately broken when the coupling to the reservoir is considered . furthermore , we have found that the current grows linearly with the parameter that characterizes the strength of the inelastic scattering .",
    "this behavior has also been found in other pumped systems with broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the dc - current in the case of the two - band and n - band ( disordered ) ring is also in agreement with the conclusions of refs . @xcite which have been devoted to argue against the possibility of resistive behavior caused by zener tunneling alone . in our case we were able to solve the problem exactly and to examine details of the behavior of the current for different strengths of inelastic scattering . for this reason",
    ", we think that our results provide a robust support to the idea that dissipation is an essential ingredient to obtain resistive behavior in this system .",
    "this work was in good part motivated by stimulating conversations with sergej flach , whom the author thanks very specially , as well as yuval gefen and victor gopar for useful correspondence and discussions .",
