    "recent discovery of a universal upper bound of a lyapunov exponent defined in quantum field theories , provided by maldacena , shenker and stanford @xcite , attracts much attention , as it can bridge physics of black holes and quantum information .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 of so - called out - of - time - ordered correlators @xcite of the theories is expected by the temperature @xmath2 , @xmath3 the characteristic @xmath2-dependence was originally derived by thought - experiments of shock waves near black hole horizons @xcite ( and subsequent papers @xcite ) and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the bound is saturated by the sachdev - ye - kitaev model @xcite , which ignited interesting development ( see for example @xcite , and also @xcite ) .",
    "one of the important questions is , among various physics associated with black hole horizons , what provides the bound , other than the shock waves .    in history , chaos of motion of a relativistic particle has been extensively studied .",
    "classic examples include various motion of a particle orbiting around black holes ( for example , see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , it would leave an imprint on gravitational wave emitted from it  @xcite .",
    "observation of gravitational wave , which was recently realized by ligo experiment @xcite , might be able to detect such chaotic behavior around black holes .",
    "there were also an attempt to relate unstable circular geodesics of null rays and their lyapunov exponents to quasi - normal mode frequencies  @xcite .",
    "however , the universal feature of the lyapunov exponent is yet to be uncovered .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to relate these two subjects which have developed independently .",
    "we consider a relativistic particle moving near a black hole horizon .",
    "it is not orbiting around the black hole , but pulled outward by some external forces such as electromagnetic or scalar forces .",
    "the force is so strong that the particle can come very close to the horizon without falling into it . as a result",
    ", we find a local maximum of the total effective potential at which a lyapunov exponent @xmath1 for particle trajectories can be evaluated .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the exponent is independent of the strength and the species of the external force , and also of the particle mass .",
    "it is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the surface gravity of the black hole horizon .",
    "the maximum of the potential works as a separatrix of the phase space motion of the particle , therefore , unless there are some other sources of the chaos , the evaluated lyapunov exponent is an upper bound of lyapunov exponents of chaotic motion of the particle : the horizon is a nest of the chaos . since the surface gravity is equal to @xmath6 where @xmath2 is the hawking temperature of the black hole , our universal upper bound is identical to .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in section [ sec : pm ] , we derive effective lagrangian of a particle pulled by electromagnetic or scalar force , near a black hole horizon . in section [ sec : nest ] , we evaluate the lyapunov exponent at the separatrix and describe the universality . in section [ sec : num ] , we perform numerical simulation of the particle motion and demonstrate the existence of the chaos , with a brief evaluation of the lyapunov exponent . in section [ sec : ang ] , we revisit a model of orbiting neutral particle and find that it can not come closer to the horizon to realize . in section [ app : generic ] , we analyze generic potentials and show that higher spin forces violate the bound . the final section is for our conclusion . in appendices , after reviewing the surface gravity and temperature of a black hole horizon in appendix  [ app : surfacegravity ] , we provide a simplified model with a chaos , to discuss a relation between the chaos and redshift in appendix  [ sec : red ] .",
    "we also examine the particle motion with scalar force taking the gravitational backreaction into account in appendix  [ app : scalar ] .",
    "the theme of the study is to show a universal behavior appearing in the motion of a relativistic particle near black hole horizons . in this section",
    "we derive effective lagrangians of a particle which can come very close to the horizon .",
    "let us consider a relativistic particle with mass @xmath7 in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we are particularly interested in it moving near a black hole horizon .",
    "let us consider a black hole with a metric given by @xmath9 at the horizon , the factor @xmath10 diverges , and the surface gravity @xmath5 of this black hole ( see appendix a ) is given by @xmath11 we consider spherically symmetric and static black holes given by @xmath12 at the horizon , the function @xmath13 and @xmath14 are expanded as @xmath15 a non - extreme regular black hole satisfies @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corresponds to a usual extreme black hole . in these cases ,",
    "the surface gravity is calculated as @xmath18 these expressions are valid also for spherically symmetric black holes in asymptotically ads spaces and for large black holes .",
    "the lagrangian of a particle with mass @xmath7 moving in an external potential @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the metric with @xmath22 .",
    "we take a static gauge @xmath23 , then in the given metric , the lagrangian is @xmath24 this expression assumes that the particle moves only in the @xmath25 directions .",
    "the dependence on other angular variables can be incorporated trivially .",
    "our focus is on the near - horizon region of the black holes with @xmath16 , the standard case . using the expansion with the distance from the horizon denoted by @xmath26 , the particle lagrangian is written as @xmath27 where we introduced a coordinate @xmath28 . to focus on slow motion of the particle",
    ", we take the non - relativistic limit by assuming the time - derivative terms are sufficiently smaller than the other part .",
    "if the potential @xmath29 in these coordinates is regular at the horizon , we may generically be able to approximate the external potential as a linear one along the radial @xmath30 direction , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is some negative coefficient , for which the lagrangian reduces to @xmath33    - c x   \\ , .",
    "\\label{lm}\\ ] ] the angular dependence ( @xmath34-dependence ) is not important and we omit it here .",
    "the potential @xmath35 for the @xmath34 direction can be flat or even harmonic @xmath36 , and we assume that the @xmath34 motion does not contribute much to the following argument . the angular motion of a particle will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ang ] independently .     given in .",
    "the origin of the plot is the horizon @xmath37 .",
    "the potential has a maximum near the horizon , due to the competition between the gravitational potential and the external force.,width=226 ]    from eq .  , we can define the effective potential @xmath38 by @xmath39 the first term is the gravitational potential which behaves as @xmath40 near the horizon @xmath37 .",
    "the second term is the external potential which we introduced in order to control the particle probing the horizon .",
    "since we need the information back , the particle should not fall into the horizon , so the coefficient @xmath32 is taken to be negative . with this combination one can easily find that the potential has an unstable extremum near the horizon .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] .",
    "the position of the extremum is given by @xmath41 if we increase the energy of the particle , at some energy the particle can reach the extremum .",
    "the particle motion around the extremum is slow enough , and the non - relativistic approximation is valid around there . around the top of the potential , we can expand the effective potential as @xmath42 then , around @xmath43 , the @xmath30 part of the lagrangian is approximated by @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{lag}\\ ] ] this is an inverse harmonic oscillator with a specific background dependence .",
    "a notable feature of this lagrangian is that the slope of the potential @xmath32 contributes only to the overall factor , and so does the mass @xmath7 and the ratio of the metric components @xmath45  the particle dynamics is sorely characterized by @xmath5 . in the next section , we study how this action can characterize the chaos around the black hole horizon .    in deriving the particle motion given by the lagrangian",
    ", we have assumed that the potential @xmath35 can be approximated by a linear function .",
    "we can validate this assumption by adopting a standard electric force to generate the potential @xmath35 .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath46 in the vacuum near the horizon is governed by a field equation @xmath47 this particular metric dependence is important for us , since the factor @xmath48 does not have any singular behavior at the horizon .",
    "in fact it is merely a nonzero constant at the leading order of the near - horizon expansion .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic potential @xmath46 is solved by a linear function of @xmath49 near the horizon .",
    "supposing that the point particle has a charge @xmath50 , the potential term in the action can be written simply in the present coordinate system , in a reparameterization - invariant and gauge - invariant manner , as @xmath51 which is equal to @xmath52 with our gauge fixing @xmath23 .",
    "so , the potential term @xmath35 in the lagrangian is equal to the electrostatic potential which is a linear function .",
    "this validates our assumption to derive the particle action .",
    "if the electric field is created by the black hole itself , the spherically symmetric black hole is a reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "it has spherically symmetric coulomb potential @xmath46 , which is linear in @xmath30 if it is expanded around any point on the horizon .",
    "so , the reissner - nordstrm black hole is one example to realize our set - up . in general , the electric field",
    "could be prepared by any other sources .",
    "other candidate for the potential is a scalar force .",
    "here we show that even with the scalar force the resultant particle action near the extremum of the potential has the same form as .. ] in the presence of the scalar potential @xmath53 , a reparameterization - invariant lagrangian of a particle is @xmath54 a scalar field equation near the horizon , which is analogous to the electromagnetic case , is @xmath55 near the horizon this has a generic solution which is a logarithmic function @xmath56 with an arbitrary constant @xmath32 and a positive constant @xmath57 . using this scalar field solution ,",
    "the effective potential is written as @xmath58 for negative @xmath32 , the scalar force can overcome the gravitational force and the particle can escape from the horizon . thus the effective potential has a maximum , at @xmath59 we can repeat the analysis to derive the effective lagrangian near the local maximum @xmath60 of the effective potential .",
    "the result is @xmath61 \\ , .",
    "\\label{lag2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this effective action turns out to be of the same form as except for the overall coefficient .",
    "so , we conclude that the near - horizon particle motion around the maximum of the potential is universally given by the surface gravity @xmath5 .",
    "it is independent of the species of the forces and their strengths characterized by the slopes @xmath32 of the potentials , and also of the particle mass @xmath7 and the ratio of the metric components @xmath45 .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the relativistic particle near the horizon , pulled by scalar or electromagnetic forces toward outside , has an effective action ( or equivalently ) at the potential maximum near the horizon .",
    "the particle follows the equation of motion with the inverse harmonic potential , @xmath62 solving the equation of motion , we find the particle trajectory in the @xmath30 direction as @xmath63    the exponentially growing behavior shows a support of a chaos .",
    "once a coupling to the other coordinates such as @xmath34 is restored , the integrability of the one - dimensional system is lost , and generically a chaos appears . if the potential @xmath29 is minimized along @xmath34 at some value of @xmath34 , that position together with @xmath60 is a separatrix of the phase space .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 of the particle motion is generally bounded from above by the behavior about the separatrix with no perturbation by @xmath34 , because of the following reasons : first , the particle motion experiences regions of the configuration space other than the separatrices , and the lyapunov exponent is given by an average throughout the motion , thus the averaging reduces the lyapunov exponent .",
    "second , when the energy is not large enough to get closer to the separatrices , the lyapunov exponent can not reach the value at the separatrices .",
    "so we obtain a bound for the lyapunov exponent of the chaos caused by this separatrix as @xmath64    remarkably , the bound is purely given by the surface gravity of the black hole horizon .",
    "this is because the lagrangian of the particle near the horizon does not depend on the parameters of the system @xmath32 , @xmath7 and @xmath45 , since they appears just in the overall factor .",
    "the motion of the particle is governed only by the surface gravity @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the upper bound of the lyapunov exponent is given solely by the surface gravity .",
    "using the hawking temperature of the black hole @xmath65 , we can express this bound as @xmath66 this inequality coincides with the conjectured chaos bound by maldacena , shenker and stanford @xcite .",
    "let us briefly discuss explicit examples .",
    "a typical case is a schwarzschild black hole in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions , whose metric is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the horizon radius .",
    "the mass @xmath69 and the surface gravity @xmath5 of this black hole are given by @xmath70 when we derive the lagrangian , first we make an approximation of the near - horizon , which is ensured if @xmath71 we look at the region around @xmath72 , thus we need to require @xmath73 , which amounts to @xmath74 this means that the external potential @xmath29 is set rather strong compared to the gravitational force .",
    "this is natural since we want to extract the behavior of the particle near the horizon , while the particle needs to be kept outside of the horizon by being pulled by the external force .",
    "let us examine the case of an extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath75 the near - horizon metric is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the curvature scale of the ads@xmath78 spacetime in the @xmath79 part of the metric . for this metric",
    ", the lagrangian of a point particle is written as @xmath80 - v(x ) \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence the effective potential in this case is given by @xmath81 the electrostatic potential @xmath35 is again a linear function near the horizon due to , thus , there is no stationary point for @xmath82 .",
    "this means that there is no extremum which could form a separatrix , thus there is no origin of the chaos .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is expected to vanish @xmath83 unless there exists some other source of a chaos .",
    "one could say that @xmath83 is consistent with the bound through the fact the the extreme black hole has zero temperature .",
    "to illustrate that the black hole horizon is a nest of chaos , in this section we perform numerical analyses of the particle motion , to evaluate poincar sections and lyapunov exponents .",
    "it will be shown that as the motion approaches the horizon , in other words , the separatrix , a chaos emerges .",
    "our particle motion near the horizon does not refer to any concrete form of the potential @xmath29 .",
    "so it is instructive to work with the simplest example , a harmonic oscillator in @xmath30 and @xmath34 space .",
    "this example is particularly intriguing since without the gravitational effect the system is completely integrable and regular , thus it is easier to detect the effect of the black hole horizon .",
    "the lagrangian of the model we consider is given by @xmath84 with @xmath85 , where @xmath5 is the surface gravity .",
    "the horizon is located at @xmath37 , while the center of the harmonic potential is off the horizon and located at @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the harmonic potential has a parameter @xmath88 , but the chaos bound is expected not to depend on this @xmath88 .",
    "we present two kinds of chaos analyses , one is the poincar section and the other is the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the results for the poincar sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath30 while the vertical axis is @xmath89 , the conjugate momentum for @xmath30 .",
    "the sections are the slice defined by @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "three figures are for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and we have chosen @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for this numerical simulation .",
    "colors correspond to different initial conditions at the fixed energy .",
    "note that the energy has an upper bound because a particle with too much energy will fall into the black hole horizon and thus chaos is not well - defined .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] that the poincar section consists of regular tori for small energy .",
    "but for a larger energy , the motion approaches the horizon @xmath37 and the tori are broken to be transformed to scattered plots which indicate a chaos .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : model2-l ] , we show a numerical calculation of a lyapunov exponent using the numerical method of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the initial condition is chosen as @xmath98 and @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "the value of the energy is chosen such that the particle can come close enough to the horizon .",
    "there are four lyapunov exponents as the phase space is four - dimensional , and because this is a hamiltonian system , two of the lyapunov exponents vanish .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that the four lyapunov exponents approach @xmath101 respectively . the largest lyapunov exponent , whose numerical value is @xmath102 in this case , is found to be smaller than the conjectured upper bound given by the value @xmath94 .    in general , lyapunov exponent depends on the initial condition .",
    "so , our choice of the initial condition is not generic , and is not expected to saturate the bound @xmath94 . since we observed that the obtained value of the lyapunov exponent is lower than the bound ,",
    "it is consistent with our conjectured bound .    .",

    "in this paper , we so far described motion of a relativistic particle near a black hole horizon , pulled by external forces such as an electromagnetic force or a scalar force . on the other hand , common force which have been studied in many literature",
    "is a centrifugal force of a neutral particle , that is , an angular momentum .",

    ", we consider a schwarzschild black hole as the background , for which @xmath114 .",
    "we substitute this to , and consider a limit @xmath115 to make the effect of the angular momentum largest .",
    "then @xmath116 this potential has an unstable maximum at @xmath117 on the other hand the horizon is located at @xmath112 , so , the unstable orbit is not close to the horizon , whatever the value of the angular momentum is .",
    "we can show that the same conclusion follows when the background is a reissner - nordstrm black hole , for which @xmath118 and the position of the unstable maximum is at @xmath119 .    in our previous examples with the electromagnetic force or the scalar force ,",
    "the near - horizon condition @xmath120 was met .",
    "this time , for any large angular momentum , we can not reach this region of the near horizon geometry .",
    "therefore , angular motion of a relativistic particle around the black hole does not have the universal upper bound for the lyapunov exponent @xmath121 .",
    "so far we considered the electromagnetic or the scalar forces .",

    "supposing on the other hand that the particle is an approximation of a d - particle or a wrapped d - brane , our model may be mapped naturally to string theory . in any case ,",
    "extension to include larger worldvolume for the chaos analysis is important ( see @xcite for a chaotic d7-brane motion ) .",
    "since our bound is dictated by the surface gravity , we may argue that our universal chaos originates in redshift near the black hole horizon .",
    "in fact , the redshift means a very slow motion of a particle as measured from an observer at the spatial infinity . in appendix [ sec : red ] , we analyzed a simple model with redshift and found that a chaos emerges even in this case , although this result itself may not be enough to assure that the origin of the chaos is the redshift .",
    "for the case of the shock waves @xcite the redshift is in fact the origin of the universal chaos .",
    "furthermore , as shown in section [ sec : ang ] , simply orbiting particles do not come closer to the horizon , but it has a separatrix .",
    "it is consistent with an observation by polchinski @xcite concerning ruelle resonances . in summary",
    ", the relation between the separatrix and the redshift could be not so simple , and further analysis of various separatrices will be necessary to reveal the reason of the universality .    finally ,",
    "in view of the ads / cft correspondence , a gauge - theory interpretation of our separatrix is important and needs to be studied .",
    "some weak - coupling analysis of chaotic d0-brane motion @xcite ( yang - mills models were originally investigated in @xcite ) will show the separatrix of our type , if exists .",
    "then the mystery of the black hole horizons , such as the information loss problem @xcite , may be revealed , since the interpretation of the infinite redshift of a classical gravity in terms of strongly coupled gauge theories or quantum information could be provided there .",

    "we have worked on the motion of a relativistic particle , and found a separatrix which provides a nest of chaos .",
    "the separatrix is an inverted harmonic oscillator , and its existence is based on the black hole horizon . at the separatrix ,",
    "the motion of the particle becomes extremely slow , and this is the physical reason of the emergent chaos : exponentially slow motion enlarges the difference in phase space motion at later time . around the black hole horizon",
    ", there is a physical reason to expect the slow motion . near the horizon ,",
    "the factor @xmath10 diverges , and the motion is infinitely redshifted , to realize the slow motion .",
    "so , it is quite natural to expect that a chaos always appear at black hole horizons .    in this appendix",
    ", we present a simple model and discuss a possible relation between the redshift and the separatrix .",
    "let us consider the following non - relativistic model with a `` horizon '' , @xmath169 here @xmath170 and @xmath171 specify the location of a particle in a two - dimensional plane , and we put a harmonic oscillator potential centered at @xmath86 for illustrating the originally - regular system , as before .",
    "the presence of a black hole `` horizon '' is given by the `` metric '' @xmath172 which diverges at @xmath37 .",
    "the `` horizon '' is located at a line @xmath37 , and the motion is restricted to the region @xmath173 .",
    "as expected , a numerical analysis of this simple model exhibits a chaos when the trajectory approaches the horizon . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we show poincar sections @xmath174 defined by the condition @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath97 and @xmath95 for our numerical simulations . from left to right in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we have chosen @xmath177 and @xmath100 respectively . when the energy @xmath178 approaches @xmath179 , the trajectory approaches the horizon . from the figures , we find that some kam tori collapse and we have a chaos .",
    "the collapsed trajectories show up only for values of the energy close to @xmath179 , that is , only for trajectories getting close to the `` horizon '' @xmath37 . of course",
    ", if we took @xmath180 instead , this model would be integrable and there is no chaos .",
    "therefore , the origin of the chaos of this model is the `` horizon '' .",
    "it can also be seen from the poincar sections , because a particle which feels the redshift at the horizon is shown to have a scattered section and so is subject to a chaos .    to discuss a relationship between the simple redshift model here and the separatrix which we have studied in this paper , let us expand the model around the `` horizon '' @xmath37 .",
    "we obtain @xmath181 the potential term is regular , while the kinetic term has the divergence at @xmath37 .",
    "now , we make a coordinate redefinition for @xmath182 , @xmath183 then the lagrangian is brought to the form @xmath184 this is nothing but a model with an inverted harmonic oscillator potential , and is a typical situation near the separatrix .",
    "the slow motion was realized by the redshift in the original model , but after the coordinate redefinition , the physics is shown to be identical to an inverted harmonic potential for @xmath185 . in this manner",
    ", the redshift can be understood as an origin of a chaos .",
    "note that in this model the separatrix is on top of the `` horizon '' @xmath37 , while in the particle model studied in section [ sec : pm ] the separatrix is a little bit separated from the horizon .",
    "so in general these two models are not equivalent to each other",
    ". it would be interesting if some more concrete physical origin of the universal chaos found in this paper can be discussed from the viewpoint of the redshift .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : pm ] , we analyzed the motion of a point particle with scalar interaction , and found that its motion is governed by the surface gravity of the background black hole .",
    "one of caveats in this analysis was that such a static scalar field diverges at the horizon and the spacetime becomes singular once the gravitational backreaction is taken into account . in this appendix , we repeat the analysis taking an exact solution of einstein equations with scalar field as the background and observe how it changes the conclusion derived in the main text .    the background solution we take in this appendix is the exact solution of a spherically - symmetric static object with scalar charge , the wyman solution given by  @xcite @xmath186 where @xmath187 this solution is known to be equivalent to the janis - newman - winicour solution  @xcite , and the relationship between them is addressed in , e.g. , ref .",
    "the equalities in eq .",
    "( [ wdef ] ) hold when the scalar field vanishes ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "this is a solution of the einstein equation with a massless scalar field : @xmath189 this spacetime has a naked singularity at @xmath190 , where the circumferential radius @xmath191 becomes zero .",
    "since the horizon is absent in this spacetime , it does not make sense to calculate the surface gravity .",
    "for example , the quantity corresponding to the surface gravity  ( [ surfacegravity ] ) at @xmath192 is evaluated as @xmath193 where we introduced @xmath194 .",
    "because @xmath195 , it diverges unless @xmath196 , that is , when the scalar field vanishes",
    ". instead of this @xmath5 , in the following we will focus on the quantity defined by @xmath197 which may be regarded as the proper acceleration generated by the background geometry at @xmath43 measured by an observer at infinity . also , we assume that the scalar potential felt by a point particle is given by @xmath198 it is different from @xmath199 in eq .",
    "( [ wscalar ] ) by a constant shift , which is free to add since eq .",
    "( [ eeqw ] ) depend only on derivatives of @xmath199 , and also by an overall coefficient , which corresponds to the coupling constant between the scalar field and the particle .",
    "the lagrangian for the radial motion in this case is given by @xmath200 \\notag \\\\   & \\simeq   m \\left ( 1 + c \\log \\frac{x}{\\tilde c } \\right )   \\left [    f^{-\\frac{3\\gamma}{2 } } \\dot x^2 - f^{\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } } \\right ] , \\label{lscalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we define the effective potential by @xmath201 the approximations used at `` @xmath202 '' is valid when @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 is sufficiently small .",
    "one of the characterization of this regime is that @xmath206 and @xmath207 becomes sufficiently small : @xmath208    assuming @xmath209 , we find that the maximum of @xmath38 is located at @xmath210 we find that the lagrangian is approximated around @xmath211 as @xmath212\\ , .",
    "\\label{lwyman}\\ ] ] this equation implies that the lyapunov exponent in this case is given by @xmath213 , which is independent of @xmath32 . in this sense ,",
    "the lyapunov exponent of the particle trajectory shows the universality similar to that found in sec .",
    "[ sec : pm ] even in this case , if we focus on the local acceleration @xmath122 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pm ] , we assumed that the background geometry is fixed to that of a spherically - symmetric static black hole , and the scalar hair is treated as a probe field on it .",
    "relationship of this case and that addressed in this appendix is subtle , but it may be fair to suppose that the case of sec .  [",
    "sec : pm ] is reproduced from the above derivation if the background geometry at @xmath60 is sufficiently close to a usual black hole geometry . to realize such a situation , @xmath214 of eq .",
