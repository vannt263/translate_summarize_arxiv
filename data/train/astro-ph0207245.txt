    "it is known that the chemical composition of the interstellar medium is oxygen - rich .",
    "hence , the overwhelming majority of the stars are formed with a carbon to oxygen ratio lower than unity , and most of them do not change this property during their evolution . however , there are exceptions : several classes of stars are known , whose carbon to oxygen ratio in the envelope is larger than unity ( by number of atoms ) .",
    "these stars are named carbon ( c ) stars .",
    "the existence of carbon stars must be related to some specific mechanism , acting on a limited population of objects .",
    "there are basically three possibilities : i ) the carbon enrichment is the result of a deep mixing process suitable to pollute the photosphere with the carbon synthesized by shell he - burning in the stellar interior ; ii ) it is due to mass transfer of carbon - rich material after the stellar birth ; iii ) it dates back to the star s birth , due to an anomalous composition of the parental cloud , more enriched in carbon than in oxygen . concerning the last hypothesis , so far no such interstellar clouds have been detected in galactic disk environments , though the hypothesis is not completely ruled out for certain low metallicity stars ( beveridge & sneden 1994 ) . in the second case ,",
    "the origin of the carbon - rich material is simply moved to another place , i.e. the carbon - rich primary component of a binary system .",
    "for instance , the stars of the ch spectral type ( luck & bond 1991 ; vanture 1992a , b , c ) most likely owe their carbon enhancement to the transfer of carbon - rich material from a companion ( now a white dwarf ) .",
    "these stars are usually named _ extrinsic _",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars to distinguish them from those deriving their carbon enhancement from nuclear processing in their interiors ( hypothesis i ) , which are called _",
    "intrinsic_. here , we shall deal with a specific subclass of carbon stars , those of spectral type n. we shall see later that most probably all of them can be classified as intrinsic c - rich objects .",
    "they are formed through the mixing into the envelope of newly produced @xmath5c from he burning .",
    "stellar evolution then limits the candidates to evolved stars with masses @xmath6 , in particular those ascending agb .",
    "the structure of an agb giant is characterized by a degenerate co core , by two shells ( of h and he ) burning alternatively , and by an extended convective envelope . in the hr diagram , these stars lay close to the brightest part of the hayashi line .",
    "they become long period variable of the irregular , semiregular or mira types , presenting large mass - loss rates : @xmath7 to @xmath8 m@xmath9yr ( wallerstein & knapp 1998 ) . as a consequence , a thick circumstellar envelope eventually forms , sometimes developing detached shells . depending on its chemical composition and optical thickness , this circumstellar material can obscure partially or completely the central star at optical wavelengths ( knapp & morris 1985 ; olofsson et al . 1993 ; marengo et al .",
    "schwarzschild & hrm ( 1965 ) early showed that thermal instabilities in the he - shell ( thermal pulses , tp ) occur periodically during the advanced phases of agb evolution . during a tp the whole region between the h shell and the he shell",
    "( called `` the he intershell '' ) becomes convective . after each tp ,",
    "the convective envelope penetrates downward dredging - up material previously exposed to incomplete he - burning conditions .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ third dredge up _ ( tdu ) , and its main consequence is the increase of the carbon content in the envelope so that , eventually , the c / o ratio can exceed unity and the star becomes a carbon star .",
    "in such a way , the carbon content in the envelope is expected to increase along the spectral sequence m@xmath1ms@xmath1s@xmath1sc@xmath1c , stars of spectral class c showing c / o@xmath10 ( see e.g. iben & renzini 1983 ; smith & lambert 1990 ) .",
    "another important consequence of tdu is the enrichment of the envelope in",
    "_ s_-elements .",
    "the necessary neutrons for the @xmath0-process are released by two reactions : @xmath3c@xmath11o , which provides the bulk of the neutron flux at low neutron densities ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14ne@xmath15 mg , which is activated at temperatures @xmath16 k , providing a high peak neutron density ( @xmath17 @xmath13 ) and is responsible of the production of @xmath0-nuclei controlled by reaction branchings ( see wallerstein et al .",
    "1997 ; busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the abundances of @xmath0-nuclei are known to increase along the above mentioned spectral sequence , as the star gradually ascends the agb .",
    "evidence of this was provided during the last few decades by several studies on agb stars of different spectral types : ms and s stars ( c / o@xmath18 ) ( smith & lambert 1985 , 1986 , 1990 ) ; sc stars ( c / o@xmath19 ) ( lloyd - evans 1983 ; abia & wallerstein 1998 , hereafter paper i ) and even post - agb supergiants of spectral types a and f ( van winckel & reyniers 2000 ; reddy , bakker , & hrivnak 1999 ) .",
    "the above studies found consistent enhancements of @xmath0-elements with respect to `` normal '' red giants assumed as comparisons ( or with respect to the sun ) : from [ s / fe]@xmath20 in ms giants to [ s / fe]@xmath21 in s stars@xmath22 log ( x / y)@xmath23 log ( x / y)@xmath24 for the stellar value of any element ratio x / y . ] . the enrichment seems to continue along the agb phase until the planetary nebula ejection .",
    "indeed , post - agb supergiants show high enhancements , [ s / fe]@xmath25 . in this scenario , however , normal carbon stars ( n - type)-elements ( dominy 1985 ; abia & isern 2000 ) ] have still to find a place .",
    "this is so because of the complex spectra of n stars , which are so crowded with molecular and atomic absorption features ( many of which unidentified ) that abundance analysis has been strongly limited .",
    "the situation has not improved much with the advent of spectrum synthesis techniques .",
    "indeed , the only abundance studies available to date are those by kilston ( 1975 ) and utsumi ( 1970 , 1985 ) , still based on abundance indexes and on low - resolution photographic spectra , respectively .",
    "these works suggested that n stars were @xmath0-element rich , showing overabundances by a factor of ten with respect to the sun .",
    "as far as the agb phase is concerned , this figure is not in direct contradiction with the accepted general scenario of @xmath0-nuclei enhancement ( see e.g. busso et al .",
    "more likely , such high production factors might be difficult to reconcile with the enrichment in post - agb supergiants showing similar , or even smaller , abundances .",
    "however , the large observational uncertainties for c - rich red giants , and the lack of adequate model atmospheres has so far prevented a solid theoretical interpretation .    in a previous work ( abia et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter paper ii ) we presented high - resolution spectroscopic observations for a sample of n stars focusing our attention on light @xmath0-elements ( ls ) , sited at the abundance peak near the neutron - magic number @xmath26 , around the @xmath27kr branching point of the @xmath0-process path .",
    "we showed how the analysis of the abundance ratios of rb ( a neutron - density sensitive element , see e.g. beer & macklin 1989 ) relative to its neighbors ( sr , y and zr ) yields information on important details of the @xmath0-process mechanism operating , and on the initial stellar mass .",
    "we concluded that @xmath0-processing suggests low mass stars ( lms , @xmath2 ) as the likely parents of c(n ) giants .    in lms",
    "the major neutron source is @xmath3c , which burns radiatively in a tiny layer during the interpulse phase ( straniero et al .",
    "1995 ) at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath28 8 kev ) , as a consequence of the formations of a @xmath3c - rich _ pocket _ in the intershell region . in the rarer agb stars of intermediate mass ( ims ) ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath14ne would instead be favored as a neutron source , by the higher temperature in thermal pulses .",
    "because of the very different neutron density provided by the two neutron - producing reactions , different compositions are expected from them , especially for the ls mixture .",
    "it is on this basis that in paper ii we drew our conclusions for the initial masses .    in paper",
    "ii we also discussed the @xmath5c/@xmath3c ratios measured in the sample stars , showing that most of them can not be explained by canonical stellar models on the agb phase , requiring probably the operation of an ad - hoc mixing mechanism .",
    "this mechanism is often indicated with the term cool bottom process ( cbp ) .",
    "it is expected to occur in low - mass stars during the red giant branch and perhaps , also during the agb phase ( wasserburg , boothroyd , & sackmann 1995 ; nollett , busso , & wasserburg 2002 ) .",
    "in the present work we have extended our study of @xmath0-element nucleosynthesis in n stars to the nuclei belonging to the second @xmath0-process peak : ba , la , ce , nd , and sm . we also re - analyzed the @xmath0-element abundances already derived in paper ii , by applying the spectral synthesis method .",
    "together , these data are compared with recent models for @xmath0-processing in agb stars at the metallicities relevant for our sample stars .",
    "furthermore , using the infrared properties and tc content , we discuss the possibility that our stars be extrinsic carbon stars , concluding that this is unlikely for several reasons .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "in @xmath30 we present the characteristics of the stars and the spectroscopic observations .",
    "section @xmath31 describes the method of analysis and the sources of error .",
    "our abundance results are reported in @xmath32 together with a comparison with similar studies in other agb stars and with models of agb nucleosynthesis .",
    "finally , in @xmath33 we summarize the main conclusions that can be drawn from this work .",
    "the spectra of our n star sample were collected at the roque de los muchachos ( orm ) and calar alto ( caha ) observatories in several observational runs between the years 1998 and 2001 . in the former case we used the 4.2 m william herschel telescope and the 2.5 m nordic telescope with the ues and sofin spectrographs , respectively .",
    "the ues gives a maximum resolution of about 50000 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 nm , with some gaps between orders .",
    "sofin , working with the third camera configuration , reaches a maximum resolution of 180000 in 28 orders , covering about the same spectral range but with larger gaps between orders . at the caha observatory we used the 2.2 m telescope with the foces spectrograph which provides a resolution of about 35000 between @xmath36 and @xmath37 nm . in this case ,",
    "an almost complete spectral coverage is obtained .",
    "table 1 shows the sample stars and the epoch of the observations .",
    "data reduction was performed following the standard procedures using the iraf software package .",
    "details on this are quoted in abia & isern ( 2000 ) and in paper ii . in the present work",
    "we add new n stars to the sample studied in paper ii , namely : rv cyg , s aur , ss vir , t dra , tt cyg , u hya , u lyr , vy uma , v429 cyg and w cma .",
    "the main parameters of the stars were derived in a way similar to the one of paper ii ; they will not be discussed again here ( see that paper for details ) .",
    "for all the stars we adopted a typical gravity of log @xmath38 and a microturbulence of @xmath39 km s@xmath40 . as in previous works , we used the grid of model atmospheres for carbon stars computed by the uppsala group ( see eriksson et al .",
    "1984 for details ) .",
    "the absolute abundances of cno , the c / o ratio ( which mainly determines the global shape of the spectrum in carbon stars ) and the @xmath5c/@xmath3c ratios were derived as discussed in paper ii .",
    "table 2 shows the final parameters adopted for each star .    in order to estimate the absolute bolometric magnitudes m@xmath41 of our stars ( table 1 ) we used the empirical relationships between m@xmath41 and m@xmath42 for carbon stars obtained by @xcite .",
    "the average k - magnitude values ( the stars studied are variable ! ) were taken from the _ two micron sky survey _",
    "( neugebauer & leigthon 1969 ) , available at the simbad data base . actually ,",
    "though recent catalogs of near infrared images and point sources have become available ( namely : 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 , and denis , epchtein et al . 1999 ) , our sources are too bright for them , and are saturated .",
    "recent observations at infrared wavelengths have been collected by the recent fifth edition of the catalog of infrared observations , ( gezari et al .",
    "1999 ) ; a few of our stars are present in the compilation , and the colors derived are compatible with those used here within the uncertainties .",
    "k magnitudes were corrected for interstellar extinction according to the galactic extinction model by @xcite with @xmath43 ( cardelli et al .",
    "distances were calculated from the _ hipparcos intermediate astrometric data _",
    "( van leeuwen & evans 1998 ) .",
    "the hipparcos parallaxes for carbon stars generally show much lower precision than those calculated for hotter main sequence stars .",
    "parallaxes for carbon stars of different spectral types have been partially reprocessed ( knapp , pourbaix , & jorissen 2001 ; pourbaix , knapp , & jorissen 2002 ; bergeat et al .",
    "2001 , bergeat , knapik , & rutily 2002a , b ) . however , the bolometric magnitudes showed in table 1 have still to be taken with some caution . in any case ,",
    "it is remarkable that the overwhelming majority of the stars have m@xmath44 , the maximum theoretical luminosity of an agb star when its core mass reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit , according to core - luminosity relation by paczyski ( 1970 ) .",
    "our sample stars have in average m@xmath45 , but a considerable number have lower luminosity .",
    "this figure coincides with recent luminosity studies of carbon stars in the galaxy ( bergeat , knapik , & rutily 2002a ) and in the nearby stellar systems ( westerlund et al . 1991 , 1995 )",
    "utsumi ( 1970 ) first noted that in n stars the blend effect of molecular bands is not very serious in the spectral regions @xmath46 and @xmath47  .",
    "he also found that many lines of @xmath0-process and rare - earth elements present in these spectral regions are of moderate intensity , and therefore they are useful for abundance analysis . here",
    ", however , we have concentrated our analysis in the @xmath48  spectral range since the radiation flux received from many carbon stars below 4500  is very limited , because of the presence of strong c@xmath49 molecular absorption features below that wavelength limit . in papers i and",
    "ii we used the equivalent width versus curve of growth technique to derive heavy element abundances trough a careful identification and selection of the lines ( see these papers for details ) . in the present study",
    "however , we decided to use the spectral synthesis technique because most of the lines from @xmath0-elements with high atomic mass ( ba , la , ce , nd and sm , i.e. hs elements ) present in this spectral range are heavily blended .",
    "this also allows us to verify the results of paper ii for the ls elements ( sr , y , zr ) , re - deriving their abundances independently .",
    "this check confirmed the abundances deduced in paper ii ( within the error bars , with the exception of a few cases , for reasons that are discussed below ) .",
    "this gives an important confirmation of the previous analysis technique .",
    "the spectral window studied , while being less affected by molecular blends than others , is nevertheless not free from such problems .",
    "lines from the c@xmath50 , ch and cn molecules have therefore to be considered .",
    "transitions from the @xmath5c@xmath50 , @xmath5c@xmath3c and @xmath3c@xmath50 ( a - x ) , ( b - a ) , ( d - a ) and ( e - a ) systems were found in the kurucz database ( cfaku5.harvard.edu/linelists.html ) . from the work of @xcite and kurucz data , no c@xmath50 lines from the phillips red system were predicted to be of importance in the studied spectral ranges .",
    "@xmath5c@xmath51n , @xmath3c@xmath51n , @xmath5c@xmath52n and @xmath3c@xmath52n lines were included .",
    "the cn line lists were prepared along the same lines as the tio line list of @xcite , using data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "programs by kotlar were used to compute wavenumbers of transitions in the red bands studied by @xcite .",
    "lines from the violet system were found to be very weak but were nevertheless considered .",
    "the absorption by the c@xmath50 , @xmath3c@xmath52n , @xmath5c@xmath52n and @xmath3c@xmath51n lines are found to slightly decrease the theoretical continuum by a few percent without affecting the line depths . in that spectral range ,",
    "the main contributor from these two molecules is @xmath5c@xmath51n .",
    "we adopted a solar @xmath52n/@xmath51n in all the spectral synthesis .",
    "several ch lines also play a role in the @xmath53  spectral range .",
    "the lifbase program of @xcite was used to compute these line positions and @xmath54-values .",
    "excitation energies and isotopic shifts ( lifbase provides only line positions for @xmath5ch ) were taken from the line list of @xcite . in this way , a very good fit of ch lines in the solar spectrum could be obtained , with the exception of very few lines which we removed from the list .",
    "obviously , the line list also comprises atomic line data found in the vald database @xcite and in kurucz s data ( cd - rom no . 23 ) although , for the more intense atomic lines ( mostly metals ) , we derived solar @xmath54-values using the holweger & mller ( 1974 ) model atmosphere and solar abundances by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the @xmath54-values derived in such a way showed an excellent agreement with the solar values derived by thvenin ( 1989 , 1990 ) . for a sample of about 100 lines in common we found a mean difference of @xmath55 dex . our final line list includes more than 20000 atomic and molecular lines . despite of this ,",
    "only a few lines were selected as indicators of the hs element abundances in our stars .",
    "these lines are shown in table 3 .",
    "the metallicity [ m / h ] of our sample stars was derived from selected metallic lines , `` m '' indicating an average value of ca , ti , v , fe and co abundances ( see table 3 in paper ii ) . using this average changes only slightly the values [ ls / fe ] and [ hs / fe ] derived .",
    "the hs element abundances were derived from spectrum synthesis fits to the observed spectra .",
    "the theoretical spectra were computed in lte and the abundance analysis was done line - by - line relative to the star wz cas ( c9,2j;sc7/10 ) which was used , as in paper ii , as the reference star .",
    "wz cas is a carbon star with a c / o ratio very close to unity with near solar metallicity and with very small or no @xmath0-element enhancement : [ h / fe]@xmath56 , where h ( heavies ) includes sr , y , zr , nb , ba , la , ce and pr ( see lambert et al .",
    "1986 ; abia & isern 2000 ) .",
    "this comparative analysis might reduce systematic errors due to wrong @xmath54-values and possible departures from lte @xcite .",
    "all the abundance ratios derived ( see below ) are relative to this star .",
    "the final abundance derived for each element is the mean of the abundances derived from each line , except for ba whose abundance is derived from only one line . in deriving these means ,",
    "we consider twice the abundances derived from particular lines which we believe are better abundance indicators for a given element because of their larger sensitivity to abundance variations and/or because they are placed in a less crowded region .",
    "these lines are : the @xmath57 laii , @xmath58 ceii and @xmath59 ndii lines ( see table 3 ) .    figure 1 shows an example of a theoretical fit to the observed spectrum of the star z psc in the region between @xmath60  , where most of the available @xmath0-element lines are located .",
    "figure 2 is a similar example in the region around the 4934  baii line .",
    "it can be seen in both figures that the observed spectra are generally well fitted by spectral synthesis , despite the many features still not accounted for .",
    "this last fact is a clear evidence of the remaining incompleteness of the line list used , despite the several thousands of lines included .",
    "as noted above , in the present work we have re - derived with the spectral synthesis technique the abundances of sr , y and zr obtained in paper ii ; this was permitted by the fact that most of the available lines for these elements are located in the same spectral range 4750 - 4950  studied here ( see table 3 in paper ii ) .",
    "we find a good agreement ( within typical error bars ) with the values found for these elements in paper ii ; hence , our conclusions are not modified by the present analysis . only for one star , v460 cyg ,",
    "the abundances of sr , y and zr are significantly modified .",
    "the reason of this lays in a bad interpolation done in paper ii over the grid of model atmosphere parameters for this star .",
    "there is also a modification of the rb and zr abundances in z psc with respect to paper ii .",
    "the rb abundance shown there ( table 2 ) is just a misprint , the correct value being [ rb / m]@xmath61 instead of 0.9 .",
    "the revised [ zr / m ] ratio here is @xmath621.0 dex , which is , nevertheless , in agreement within error bars with the previous value in paper ii ( @xmath620.8 dex ) . in the present work we have also been able to estimate the sr abundance in this star using the sr i line at 4811.88 ",
    ": we recall that the sr abundance in z psc was not derived in paper ii .    in paper",
    "ii we also discussed the increased difficulties found in the analysis of certain n stars , in particular iy hya , vx gem and v crb ( see that paper for details ) .",
    "in fact , the abundance results in such stars were considered with a lower weight in comparing with theoretical models .",
    "unfortunately , here the list of _ difficult _ stars has to be extended .",
    "indeed , t dra , u lyr ( both mira variables ) , s aur and v429 cyg show spectra so smeared out that we had no choice but decide to give up their analysis . for ss vir and v oph ( also mira variable ) ,",
    "the spectra are also smeared out , and in fact they provide an insufficient agreement between observed and theoretical spectra . in particular , all miras in our sample show difficult spectra .",
    "it is not clear why spectral lines in the mira variables look in this way .",
    "mira variables have generally thick circumstellar dust shells , whose contamination due to thermal emission by dust might be responsible for this problem .",
    "the gas motions due to pulsation might contribute to the broadening of spectral lines .",
    "finally , the star v781 sgr shows a weak central emission at the core of the na d lines .",
    "this is usually interpreted as due to the presence of a chromosphere .",
    "the influence of a chromosphere in the derivation of abundances in carbon stars is uncertain and is beyond the scope of this work ; therefore , we have included also this star in the group of _ difficult _ n stars .",
    "summing up , the abundances derived for iy hya , vx gem , v crb , ss vir , v oph and v781 sgr have to be considered with considerable caution . to emphasize this , in the figures below ,",
    "we have plotted with smaller symbols the abundance ratios derived for them .    the stellar atmosphere parameters ( @xmath63 , gravity , etc ) for n stars are difficult to determine with accuracy ( bergeat , knapik , & rutily 2001 , 2002a ) .",
    "note for instance that they are variable stars , therefore the effective temperature changes during the pulsation .",
    "the microturbulence in variable stars depends on the wavelength in the spectrum ( due to differences in depth of formation ) , and changes with the pulsational phase .",
    "furthermore , the existence of strong waves , shock fronts , and inhomogeneities is the rule rather than the exception in their atmosphere ( see gustafsson & jrgensen 1994 for discussion ) . in table 4",
    "we show the sensitivity of the abundances derived to typical uncertainties in the atmosphere parameters .",
    "since most of the lines used in the present work correspond to singly ionized elements ( see table 3 ) , an important source of uncertainty is the error in the gravity .",
    "the abundances derived are rather sensitive to the microturbulence parameter , indicating some saturation of the lines used in the analysis . however , the hs element abundances are mostly insensitive to uncertainties in metallicity , cno absolute abundances and the @xmath5c/@xmath3c ratio . certainly , deviations from lte might play a significant role , although they are reduced in a differential analysis as is done here . if we consider the uncertainty due to the placement of the spectral continuum ( @xmath64 ) , adding quadratically all the sources ( non systematic ) of error , we found a typical uncertainty in the absolute abundances of about @xmath65 dex for ba , @xmath66 dex for la , nd , and sm and @xmath67 dex for ce .",
    "furthermore , we have to consider the random error in the abundances of elements represented only by few lines , as in our case .",
    "we can estimate this random error only in stars where we derived individual element abundances from more than three lines . in this case",
    "we found a dispersion in the range 0.1 @xmath68 0.3 dex .",
    "nevertheless , when computing the [ hs / m ] ratios , errors are lower because some sources of error affect in the same way the metallicity ( see table 4 in paper ii ) . adding up all these contributions , we estimate a typical total error ( non systematic ) in the [ hs / m ] ratios ranging from @xmath69 ( ba ) to @xmath67 dex ( ce ) .",
    "a similar discussion can be done concerning the uncertainties in the derivation of the ls element abundances and metallicity ( see paper ii for details ) . considering this , we estimate a typical error of about @xmath70 dex in the [ hs / ls ] ratios . in table 5",
    "we show the abundance ratios with respect to the metallicity derived in our stars , referred to the comparison star wz cas .",
    "the abundances in table 5 represent the first detailed analysis of the @xmath0-element composition in n stars . in this table",
    "we show the previous results ( revised ) obtained in paper ii for the ls elements , together with the new values derived here for the hs elements , including some additional stars ( see @xmath71 ) .",
    "we confirm our previous finding that n stars are of near solar metallicity : @xmath72[m / h]@xmath73 .",
    "only two stars seem to be of low metal content ( iy hya and v crb ) ; however , we remind the difficulties found in the analysis of these objects ( see above ) . considering the abundances of y and zr as the only good tracers of the ls element enhancement - element abundances ls ( see discussion in paper ii ) . ] , our objects have @xmath72[ls / m]@xmath74 . in the same way , considering ba , la and nd as representative of the hs element enhancement ( ce and sm are derived only in a few stars ; in many of them we set just upper limits ) , the mean is @xmath72[hs / m ] @xmath750.52@xmath76 .",
    "this figure represents moderate , but significant @xmath0-element enhancement , which is clearly smaller than that obtained previously by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to paper ii for the detailed discussion made there about the explanation of this difference .",
    "the radioactive nucleus @xmath77tc ( @xmath78 yr ) is produced along the @xmath0-process path . because the agb phase spans only a few half - lives of this element , once dredged - up into the envelope",
    ", it should remain present in a certain percentage throughout the agb lifetime .    therefore , the detection of tc in the atmosphere of an agb star ( merill 1952 ) is an undeniable evidence of the @xmath0-process working _ in situ _ ( _ intrinsic _ agb ) .",
    "when , on the contrary , tc presence can be excluded , the star most probably owes its carbon enrichment to a mass transfer episode from an agb companion , _ extrinsic _ agb .",
    "unfortunately , the detection of tc in agb stars is a difficult task .",
    "the most interesting tc lines are located around @xmath79  , where agb stars are not very bright .    indeed , in most n stars this spectral region",
    "is not accessible to observations because of the strong flux depression at these wavelengths .",
    "there are , however , a couple of inter - combination tc lines that may be used for the analysis .",
    "one of them is the tci line at @xmath80  , which is however weak and not free from blends .",
    "we have extended the analysis of tc in n stars made in paper ii using this line in the additional stars included in this work .",
    "we have followed the same technique as described in abia & wallerstein ( 1998 ) . in table 5",
    "we show the results of this search . as in paper ii",
    ", a `` yes '' entry in this table means that the best fit to the 5924  blend is obtained with a non - zero tc abundance .",
    "a `` no '' entry means that a synthetic spectrum with no tc does not significantly differ from another one with a small tc abundance and , finally , a `` doubtful '' entry means that the 5924  blend can be fitted better with a small abundance of tc , but the tc absorption in the blend is not so clearly appreciated as in the case of the tc `` yes '' stars .",
    "if we consider the `` doubtful '' stars as yielding a detection , which is probably the case , table 5 shows that about @xmath81 of our targets are tc - yes n stars and thus , can be considered as _ bona fide _ intrinsic carbon stars .",
    "however , because of the difficulty in the analysis of this tc line ( weak , and in a very crowded zone ) , a non - detection does not necessarily mean that tc is absent : we do not have , unfortunately , a clear - cut possibility of excluding it .",
    "probably , a study of the resonance lines at @xmath82  , when feasible , could yield more secure conclusions .",
    "thus , additional tests are necessary to establish the extrinsic or intrinsic nature for the rest of the sample .",
    "a further help can luckily come from an analysis of infrared colors . this idea ( jura 1986 ; little - marenin & little 1988 ) arises from the fact that intrinsic agb stars ( in our case n stars ) are high mass losers and show excess infrared radiation from circumstellar dust , whereas extrinsic n stars would be first - ascent red giants with mass loss rates smaller by two orders of magnitudes at least .",
    "this was already used by jorissen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic s stars .",
    "these authors showed that the overwhelming majority of tc - deficient s stars have a ratio @xmath83 , where @xmath84 m ) and @xmath85 m ) are the 12 @xmath86 m and 2.2 @xmath86 m fluxes from the iras point source catalog and from the two - micron sky survey , respectively . on the contrary , most tc - rich s stars ( intrinsic ) have @xmath87 .",
    "we have performed a similar study in our sample of carbon stars and the result can be seen in the histogram of figure 3 .",
    "we have considered in this plot the doubtful stars as showing tc in their spectra , because of the reasons commented above . from this figure",
    "it is obvious that most of our stars have infrared excess @xmath87 and only a few show lower values ( in fact in the very narrow range @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is clear that , contrary to what happens for the s stars ( see jorissen et al .",
    "1993 ) , there is no distinction in the distribution between tc - yes and tc - no carbon stars .",
    "we might then conclude that probably all carbon stars in our sample are in fact of intrinsic nature and the quoted tc - no carbon stars are just a consequence of the difficult and uncertain analysis of the tc i @xmath89  blend on which this study is based  .",
    "in all the stars where this was possible , we confirmed the detection found from the 5924  blend . ] .",
    "similarly to what happens in s stars , a difference between tc - yes and tc - no carbon stars might be also apparent in their temperature class . the large uncertainty in the derivation of the effective temperature in carbon stars does not allow us to address this question directly from the estimated @xmath63 values .",
    "the point is that tc - yes carbon stars should be cooler and more evolved and hence should ( on average ) have more circumstellar matter to account for the infrared excess .",
    "this question can be addressed by studying the k@xmath90 $ ] vs. k@xmath91 $ ] color - color diagram .",
    "the color index k@xmath92 $ ] is defined as k@xmath93  log@xmath94 , @xmath95 being the ( non color corrected ) flux in the @xmath96 band taken from the iras point catalog source .",
    "again , we do not find a distinction between tc - yes and tc - no stars ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "all the stars are located in the region of black bodies with @xmath97 k. these temperatures are indeed expected in evolved stars during the agb phase of evolution ( note than some stars have black body temperatures lower than 2000 k ) .",
    "higher black body temperatures would instead be expected in extrinsic ( rgb ) carbon stars .",
    "a better discrimination will be possible in this field , when extensive colors for c - rich and o - rich agb stars from modern infrared cameras will become available , providing data with a higher precision than possible from iras ( see preliminary results by marengo et al .",
    "1999 ; busso et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "finally , we can also address the problem of the nature of our sample stars ( i.e. those being extrinsic or intrinsic agbs ) through a comparison with theoretical models of element enrichment in the two classes of objects , to look for parameters helping in the discrimination .",
    "there are several questions for which we can , in this way , find useful answers .",
    "is it possible , at nearly solar metallicity , to produce an extrinsic carbon star ( c / o@xmath10 ) from the transfer of carbon - rich material in a binary system ( most probably through the wind accretion mechanism , jorissen & mayor 1988 )",
    "? what should be the c / o ratio in the transferred material so that the mass - receiving companion remains c - rich ?",
    "how much these requirements depend on the stellar mass and on the metallicity of the accreting star and of the donor ?",
    "we shall come again on these problems in the next section , where we present a comparison of our observations with the results of nucleosynthesis and mixing models for intrinsic and extrinsic agb stars .",
    "in order to understand the way in which the observed abundances were created and subsequently mixed into the stellar convective envelopes , we made use of the same stellar and nucleosynthesis models already described in paper ii .",
    "they start from full stellar evolution calculations , computed with the franec evolutionary code , spanning the metallicity range from solar to 1/20 solar , and the mass range from 1.5 to 7 @xmath98 ( straniero et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .    for our purposes",
    ", we adopt the 1.5 @xmath98 model as representative of lms , since in paper ii we already concluded that most n stars are of low mass ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "notice that the theoretical expectations for a 3 @xmath98 stellar model mimic quite closely the 1.5 @xmath98 model : differences in @xmath0-element logarithmic abundances are found to be below 0.1 dex .",
    "we have computed models without mass loss , from which an asymptotic value of the parameter @xmath100 has been derived , namely 0.24 for the 1.5 @xmath98 model . on this basis",
    "a post - processing has been performed to derive the detailed nucleosynthesis products in the he intershell and the chemical modifications of the envelope ( gallino et al .",
    "the duration of the thermally pulsing agb phase is mainly determined by the assumed mass loss rate .",
    "hence , mass loss was included in the nucleosynthesis calculations trough the reimers s ( 1975 ) phenomenological law , choosing the value 0.7 for the free parameter @xmath101 . in each interpulse / pulse cycle",
    "we compute the detailed nucleosynthesis pattern that is established in the intershell zone , induced first by the neutron release from radiative @xmath3c burning in the interpulse phase , and then by the activation of the @xmath14ne neutron source in the convective instability of the he shell .",
    "one cycle after the other , we follow the penetration of envelope convection through tdu that mixes part of the processed material to the envelope ; the whole sequence is repeated till our models experience the end of tdu .",
    "the procedure assumes that some form of proton penetration below the convective border can occur at dredge up , polluting the radiative he- and c - rich layers , so that at the restart of h - shell burning the main neutron source @xmath3c can be formed . for the problems and the uncertainties involved in this assumption , as well as for the techniques used in the computations of neutron captures and the nuclear parameters used , see paper ii and gallino et al .",
    "there , in particular , we described the way in which our model sequences are created , and the efficiency of @xmath3c burning assumed . as in paper ii , we shall refer with the term st ( _ standard _ ) to models in which the mass of @xmath3c burned per cycle is 4@xmath10210@xmath103 @xmath98 in lms .",
    "then this reference abundance is scaled upward and downward to span a wide range of possibilities in the nucleosynthesis efficiency .",
    "figures 5 to 7 show a synthesis of our predictions : they present , as a function of the initial metallicity [ m / h ] , the average photospheric abundance ratios [ hs / m ] , [ ls / m ] , [ hs / ls ] at c / o = 1 , in our 1.5 @xmath98 model , assumed as representative of the lms class .    inspection of figures 5 , 6 and 7 provides a quite satisfactory agreement between observations and theoretical models , inside the wide spread of neutron release efficiency considered and taking into account the observational uncertainties of n stars .",
    "this is in agreement with previous findings on the average @xmath0-process efficiency by busso et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , derived by other classes of agb stars and their descendants at various metallicities .    a rather comprehensive picture of the @xmath0-enrichment in n stars is provided by plots in which observations and theory are compared using the @xmath0-element enhancement ( indicated by e.g. ls ) and a parameter sensitive to the neutron exposure ( e.g [ hs / ls ] , as shown in busso et al . 1995 , 2001a ) .",
    "this kind of comparison is performed in figure 8 , where n stars are shown together with other known classes of intrinsic and extrinsic agb stars . as the figure shows",
    ", the spread in the @xmath0-process efficiency ( as monitored by the n(@xmath3c)/n(@xmath104fe ) ratio in the pocket ) , is in this way constrained better , being rather limited .",
    "another result is that n stars are very close to s stars for what concerns the efficiency of mixing into the envelope . in the models ,",
    "it is indeed often sufficient to make one extra pulse to change the composition of an s star into that of a n giant , establishing a c / o ratio larger than unity .",
    "this has large consequences on the appearance of the atmosphere and of the circumstellar envelope ( chemistry , colors , type of dust formed all change considerably ) , but the corresponding change in the @xmath0-process enhancement may be rather limited .",
    "since post - agb stars usually show larger @xmath0-element enhancements than those derived here in n - stars ( see @xmath105 ) , and because our sample stars show a c / o ratio very close to one , we might speculate the stars analyzed here have just become carbon stars . as the star evolves in the agb phase and tps and tdus continue operating , more carbon and @xmath0-elements are dredged - up into the envelope",
    ". eventually the c / o ratio exceeds unity by a such large amount that the star becomes obscure at optical wavelengths due to the formation of dust .",
    "this scenario might explain the apparent _ gap _ in the level of @xmath0-element enhancement and c / o ratio observed between c(n ) stars and post - agb stars : we can not `` see '' carbon stars with a c / o ratio largely exceeding unity .",
    "we have to outline once again that our conclusions are for the moment somewhat hampered by the still large observational uncertainties for n stars , whereas typical error bars for the other classes of @xmath0-enriched stars in the galactic disc are of in general lower ( 0.20 to 0.25 dex , see e.g. busso et al .",
    ".    the interpretation of the n star abundances presented so far in the framework of lms evolution along the agb is confirmed , and even strengthened , by an analysis of the detailed element distributions in the observed stars , from the data of table 5 . in order to show this",
    "we have plotted in figure 9 a sample of fits to individual stars , obtained by comparing their observed composition with that yielded by the models in the photosphere , at c / o = 1 .",
    "the plots show a complete agreement , and we believe this provides a full confirmation that most , if not all , n stars of the galactic disk are indeed of low initial mass .",
    "in fact , from the discussion presented in paper ii we know a priori that plots made similarly to figure 9 , but using models from ims , would be often incapable of reproducing at least the `` ls '' zone , yielding in general a too high rb / sr ratio . this conclusion for the mass of carbon stars",
    "is in line with the present independent understanding of the different classes of carbon stars , provided by astrometric , kinematic , and photometric criteria ( bergeat , knapik , & rutily 2002a , b ) .      using the models outlined in the previous subsection",
    ", we can add something to the discussion of the nature of our sources .",
    "this can be done on an independent basis with respect to the ( already analyzed ) presence of tc and infrared properties .",
    "having in mind the model compositions discussed above , we can ask ourselves which predictions for @xmath0-element and carbon abundances would be derived in case some of our sample stars were extrinsic agbs . in order to study this possibility , we have first to consider that the resulting c / o ratio after mass transfer is constrained by the observed c / o value , which is very close to 1 .",
    "then we must take into account the original c and o content in the companion .",
    "this depends on metallicity , and at the moment of mass transfer it has probably not changed from the original cno composition .",
    "indeed , the long duration of core h burning ( that precedes any significant abundance change at the surface ) makes this phase the most likely for the occurrence of mass accretion .",
    "subsequently , partial @xmath5c dilution is produced by the first dredge up ( fdu ) , during the rgb phase ; this also increases the abundance of @xmath3c ( @xmath106o is only slightly reduced by fdu ) .    for a star reaching the rgb with a solar mixture of cno isotopes ,",
    "fdu would change cn abundances by a significant fraction ( e.g. @xmath5c would decrease by 13% to 40% in solar metallicity models spanning the range 1 - 5 @xmath107 ) .",
    "its impact is however marginal when the star has a high carbon enhancement at the surface .",
    "furthermore , in case of a lower - than - solar metallicity , one must take into account that the initial carbon abundance decreases with fe , whereas [ o / fe ] shows a concomitant enhancement .",
    "one can adopt general rules for this enhancement , deducing it from observations of large databases of dwarf stars at different metallicities , e.g. as described in israelian et al .",
    "note that while [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] still remains controversial at [ fe / h]@xmath108 , this does not affect our discussion , because the typical metallicity of our sample stars is much higher .",
    "we then modeled mass transfer by diluting the agb envelope composition , allowing for different `` mixing histories '' , which take into account the different possibilities described above . in all our attempts we found that , for metallicities not far from solar , it is impossible to produce an extrinsic carbon star",
    "this gives a strong support to the indications already obtained from the observational criteria .    to make this result easily understood",
    ", we can express the mass transferred by means of a semi - analytic formula .",
    "if mass transfer occurs while the secondary component is on the main sequence , the material accumulates onto a thin radiative region , whose chemical composition becomes that of the accreted material from the agb companion and is therefore characterized by a c / o ratio in excess of unity . at fdu , a homogeneous composition is established by mixing the accreted material over more internal layers , where the original chemical composition , partly modified by h burning , has been preserved .",
    "then , we can define a dilution factor @xmath109 as the ratio of the transferred mass ( @xmath110 ) to the fraction of the envelope having the original composition ( @xmath111 ) . by imposing that ,",
    "in the photosphere of the secondary star , the c / o ratio remains equal to 1 even after fdu , one can see that :    @xmath112 } ) ( ( \\rm{c / o})^{lasttdu}_{agb}-1)^{-1}\\ ] ]    here we have assumed that mass transfer occurs at the last tdu episode , in order to allow the maximum possible carbon enhancement of the secondary component , thus favoring the formation of an extrinsic carbon star . according to the franec models , tdu ceases when the envelope mass drops below a critical limit , namely @xmath1130.5 @xmath107 ; from then on , while mass loss can further decrease the envelope mass , its c / o ratio remains frozen . in table 6",
    "we report , for the 1.5 @xmath107 model at different metallicities ( column 1 ) , the final c / o ratio of the intrinsic agb star ( primary component ) at the last thermal pulse that experienced tdu ( ( c / o)@xmath114 ) and the corresponding dilution ratio @xmath109 , as derived by means of the formula reported above .",
    "obviously , there is a maximum limit in the transferred mass , which corresponds to the accretion of the whole residual mass of the agb envelope ( i.e. @xmath1130.5 @xmath107 ) .",
    "in order to give an estimate for such a limit , we further assumed that the mass of the companion star , after the mass accretion , is the lowest compatible with the age of the galactic disk , let us say @xmath1131 @xmath107 .",
    "again , this is intended to favor carbon enrichment , as it roughly corresponds to the minimum mass of the convective envelope at the fdu .",
    "correspondingly , in the most favorable conditions , we obtain an upper limit for the dilution factor @xmath109 of 1.5 .",
    "we emphasize that this limit corresponds to a very extreme case and we expect that a substantially lower value of the @xmath109 parameter should be more realistic",
    ". for example , if the mass of the secondary component after the mass accretion episode were 1.5 @xmath107 ( corresponding to an initial mass of about 1 @xmath107 ) , the limiting value of the @xmath109 parameter would become 0.7 . in any case",
    ", from a comparison with the calculated @xmath109 values reported in table 6 , it is clear that it would be practically impossible to form extrinsic carbon stars for solar metallicities .",
    "we suggest that the maximum metallicity of an extrinsic carbon star should be of the order of [ fe / h ] @xmath1150.4 to @xmath680.3 .",
    "thus , even considering the uncertainty in the metallicity of the stars considered in the present work ( @xmath70 dex ) , this simple result prevents the vast majority of them from being considered as extrinsic carbon stars .",
    "note that if a carbon star is formed as a consequence of the mass transfer process , as is indeed the case at lower metallicities , then the behavior of [ ls / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] would not be distinguishable from the trend seen for intrinsic agbs .",
    "this is related to the fact that mass transfer and the following fdu behave much like a form of dilution , as in the case of tdu , and we have no way to distinguish which of the two possible forms of dilution the @xmath0-enriched material has undergone ( see busso et al .",
    "2001a , and in particular figures 11 and 12 there , for a discussion of this in the case of ba and ch stars ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "both the observational and theoretical analysis lead us to conclude that the objects studied here are most probably intrinsic carbon stars , presently evolving along the tp - agb .",
    "exceptions may exists , but this should be tested with more direct methods , like radial velocity variations and their effects on the spectra . at the moment , for none of the n stars studied here there is any evidence of such variations .",
    "in this paper we have presented for the first time a rather complete sample of @xmath0-process abundance measurements in n - type carbon stars , extended to light and heavy species , across the @xmath0-process peaks with neutron numbers @xmath26 and @xmath116 . making use of a large line list , and of up - to - date model atmospheres for carbon rich giants ,",
    "we have deduced the @xmath0-element abundances through spectrum synthesis technique . in doing so",
    ", we have also verified previous results ( paper ii ) for the light @xmath0-elements across the @xmath27kr branching point of the @xmath0-path .",
    "n stars turn out to be characterized by s - element abundances very close to , or slightly higher than , those found for s stars . compared with the only analysis performed before ( utsumi 1985 ) , our abundances are clearly smaller ; they are smaller also with respect to those of post - agb supergiants ( reddy , bakker , & hrivnak 1999 ; van winckel & reyniers 2000 ) , and this gives rise to a general picture in which the surface enrichment continuously increases along the evolutionary sequence producing ms , s , and n stars , and subsequently yellow post - agb supergiants ( reddy et al .",
    "we have compared our data with model envelope compositions obtained from previously published calculations of agb nucleosynthesis and mixing .",
    "good agreement is obtained between low mass star models and @xmath0-element observations .",
    "several pieces of evidence ( from the detection of tc lines and infrared colors , to the theoretical relations between the initial metallicity , the mass , and the final c / o ratio ) lead us to conclude that most ( or perhaps all ) our sample stars are intrinsic tp - agb stars , so that their abundances are locally produced by the occurrence of third dredge - up during the tp - agb phases , and not generated by mass transfer in binary systems",

    "<S> abundances of sr , y , zr ( low - mass @xmath0-elements , or ls ) and of ba , la , nd , sm and ce ( high - mass @xmath0-elements , hs ) are derived using the spectral synthesis technique from high - resolution spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the n - stars analyzed are of nearly solar metallicity and show moderate @xmath0-element enhancements , similar to those found in s stars , but smaller than those found in the only previous similar study ( utsumi 1985 ) , and also smaller than those found in supergiant post - agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the present understanding of the envelope @xmath0-element enrichment in giant stars , which is increasing along the spectral sequence m@xmath1ms@xmath1s@xmath1sc@xmath1c during the agb phase . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observational data with recent @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis models for different metallicities and stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is obtained between low mass agb star models ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath0-elements observations . in low mass agb stars , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3c(@xmath4o reaction is the main source of neutrons for the @xmath0-process ; a moderate spread , however , must exist in the abundance of @xmath3c that is burnt in different stars . by combining information deriving from the detection of tc , the infrared colours and the theoretical relations between stellar mass , metallicity and the final c / o ratio </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that most ( or maybe all ) of the n - stars studied in this work are intrinsic , thermally - pulsing agb stars ; their abundances are the consequence of the operation of third dredge - up and are not to be ascribed to mass transfer in binary systems . </S>"
