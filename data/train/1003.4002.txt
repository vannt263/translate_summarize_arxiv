    "[ 1.historical account ] in 1866 , fr angelo secchi a jesuit astronomer working in italy observed prismatic spectra of about 4000 stars visually and divided stars in four broad spectral classes using common absorption features of hydrogen . during 1886 - 97 ,",
    "henry draper memorial survey at harvard carried out a systematic photographic spectroscopy of stars brighter than 9th magnitude covering entire sky using telescopes at harvard and arequipa , peru under the leadership of e.c.pickering .",
    "the henry draper catalog was published in 9 volumes of the annals of harvard college observatory between 1918 and 1924 .",
    "it contains rough positions , magnitudes , spectral classifications for 225,300 stars .",
    "earlier work by w. fleming essentially subdivided the previously used secchi classes ( i to iv ) into more specific classes , by giving letters from a to n. the strength of hydrogen lines being the main classifier , the spectral type a was assigned to stars with strongest hydrogen lines followed by b , c with weaker hydrogen lines .",
    "this system was found to be unsatisfactory since the line strengths of other lines varied irregularly and so did the b - v color .",
    "this system was improvised by a.maury , a.j.cannon and e.pickering who re - arranged the spectral sequence taking into consideration the changes in other lines and this new spectral sequence was also a sequence according to the color of the stars .",
    "but well - known stars had been already assigned the older spectral classes for long hence it was not possible to change them .",
    "we , therefore , have a spectral sequence essentially temperature dependent but goes like obafgkm . at the cool end",
    "the classification becomes more complex with parallel branches of r , n , s stars .",
    "while the m stars have tio bands , s stars display zro bands , while r and n are carbon stars showing strong bands of various molecules with carbon .",
    "these have more recently been merged into a unified carbon classifier c scheme of c1 , c2 etc with the old n0 starting at roughly c6 .",
    "another subset of cool carbon stars are the j - type stars , which are characterized by the strong @xmath0cn molecules in addition to those of @xmath1cn .",
    "each of the above mentioned spectral classes obafgkm have been subdivided into ten subclasses e.g a0 , a1 ... a9 .",
    "e. hertzsprung suggested in 1905 that spectral line widths were related to the luminosity of the stars .",
    "he pointed out that at a given apparent magnitude , the low proper motion stars would be at larger distance from us than the high proper motion stars of the same apparent magnitude and hence of higher intrinsic luminosity .",
    "these low proper motion stars were found to be exhibit narrower spectral lines so hertzsprung concluded that these narrow line stars have larger intrinsic luminosity than the broad line stars .    in 1943 , w.morgan , p.c .",
    "keenan and e.kellman introduced luminosity as second classification parameter .",
    "morgan noticed the near constancy of the gravity along the main sequence in hr diagram and luminosity class parameter was an attempt to identify stars of different gravities and hence radii at nearly constant temperature .",
    "the above mentioned system also known as yerkes spectral classification . within the system , six luminosity classes are defined on the basis of standard stars over the observed luminosity range .",
    "the six classes are :    ia : most luminous supergiants    ib : less luminous supergiants    ii : luminous giants    iii : normal giants    iv : subgiants    v : main sequence stars    the main sequence class ( dwarfs ) are the stars at the main sequence , sustaining themselves through the conversion of hydrogen to helium by nuclear fusion in the stellar core , giant is a post main sequence star which is no longer burning hydrogen at the core but has h - burning shell outside the core .",
    "giants as well as supergiant have comparable mass to dwarfs but have expanded to a much larger radii resulting in a decrease in their surface gravities .",
    "the spectral lines appear broad in the dense atmospheres of dwarfs primarily due to pressure broadening and stark broadening while the same line would appear narrow in the low gravity atmospheres of supergiants .",
    "the luminosity effects are not restricted to the narrowing of strong lines .",
    "the line strengths and ratios of line strengths of neutral and ionized species also show remarkable variations over spectral classes and luminosity types and have been used for defining the subclasses and luminosity types .",
    "in addition , there are well - known luminosity indicators such as the emission components in the lines of caii h and k in late type stars which are related to the luminosity ( absolute magnitude ) of the stars and the calibration of this relationship has been carried out by o. wilison and m.k.v.bappu in 1957 .",
    "the strength of near ir oi triplet at 7771 - 75@xmath2 has been used by osmer ( 1972 ) , arellano ferro , giridhar and goswami ( 1991 ) arellano ferro , giridhar and rojo arellano ( 2003 ) for absolute magnitude calibration of a - g stars . in the next section",
    ", we will describe the line strengths and their ratios which are used to define the spectral classes and luminosity types .",
    "[ 2.classification criteria for various spectral types ] beginning from o stars which are hottest , we will briefly describe the spectral characteristic for each spectral class and also list the spectral type and luminosity class indicators .",
    "most of the information for this tutorial section is taken from jascheck and jascheck ( 1987 ) .",
    "the figures used in this section illustrating the different spectral types and also the luminosity effects at various spectral types are taken from `` a digital spectral classification atlas v1.02 '' by r.o.gray with his permission .",

    "a more detailed study by shane(1928 ) revealed that temperature variations over the subclasses are not large and branching of these stars r and n stars is caused by abundance difference in c and o. if oxygen is more abundant than carbon then the spectrum is dominated by oxides like tio ( m stars ) . keenan and morgan ( 1941 ) used the term `` carbon stars '' instead of r and n wherein the overabundance of carbon varied from the star to star .",
