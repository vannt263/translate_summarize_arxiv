    "in hybrid mesons the gluon string between the @xmath4 pair is excited and contributes to the quantum numbers of the particle . these mesons are predictions of qcd which are not yet confirmed in experiment .",
    "more difficult to discriminate from quark model states than glueballs , it is particularly important to provide accurate predictions from lattice studies .",
    "most experimental candidates are for hybrids containing light quarks ; however , the best system for a hybrid search may be @xmath5 or @xmath6 , where there is a large gap between the lowest state and the @xmath7 and @xmath8 thresholds respectively .",
    "theoretically , heavy hybrids are easier to study ; on the lattice , nrqcd can be used to simulate heavy quarks and the results can be compared with those from hybrid potentials .    here , we present results for @xmath2 hybrids .",
    "the lattice hybrid operators are constructed from staples of gauge links , @xmath9 , in combinations corresponding to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 representations of the cubic symmetry goup , as described in lacock et al .",
    "@xcite . in early potential studies  @xcite",
    "it was found that this gluon excitation , corresponding to one unit of angular momentum about the @xmath4 axis , gives rise to the lowest hybrid meson states .",
    "combined with @xmath12 in a spin singlet  ( @xmath13 ) and triplet  ( @xmath14 ) the hybrid meson states @xmath15 are accessible , where the exotic states are shown in bold . in the static limit these states are all degenerate ; introduction of quark motion , using the lowest order nrqcd action , will create a splitting between the sets of states arising from the @xmath10 and @xmath11 gauge paths .",
    "spin - spin and spin - orbit interactions are needed in order to obtain splittings between the individual states .",
    "these spin splittings , eg between the @xmath16 , @xmath1 and @xmath17 , will be ordered in the same way as for the non - hybrid @xmath18 states and are likely to be of order @xmath19  mev .",
    "since the statistical errors in our calculation are still at approximately @xmath20  mev we ignore the fine structure and use the lowest order nrqcd action including only the kinetic energy term . in this case there is no mixing between the hybrid and normal @xmath6 states .",
    "the correlators corresponding to the hybrid operators were computed on 500 quenched @xmath21 configurations at @xmath3 .",
    "a bare @xmath22 quark mass , from @xmath6 spectroscopy , of @xmath23 was used in the nrqcd action .",
    "the hybrid signal is dominated by noise after only a few timeslices , and multiple spatial and temporal sources are required .",
    "it is essential to optimise the operators in terms of the @xmath4 separation , @xmath24 , depth of the staple , @xmath25 , and the coefficient , @xmath26 , and level , @xmath27 , of the fuzzing of the gauge links .",
    "we use the results of a study of the hybrid potential  @xcite on the same configurations to choose the optimal values of these parameters .",
    "the hybrid potential corresponding to the @xmath28 representation , @xmath29 , was calculated in the standard way using operators of the form @xmath9 . in order to find the optimal operator ,",
    "the depth @xmath25 was varied at each @xmath24 and the maximal overlap of the operator with the ground state , @xmath30 , was sought .",
    "table  [ overlaps ] presents the results as a function of @xmath25 for the example of @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath30 is not very sensitive to @xmath25 as long as @xmath25 is small .",
    "a fairly uniform optimal overlap was found for a wide range of @xmath24 , where we investigated up to @xmath32 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ potlevel ]    -0.5 cm -1 cm    the wavefunctions are broad , as expected . for a @xmath33  fm lattice",
    "we can expect large finite volume errors for a ground state hybrid meson with @xmath34  fm .",
    "figure  [ hybwave ] suggests a lattice hybrid operator with a @xmath4 separation of @xmath35  fm or @xmath36 lattice units at @xmath3 would minimise the overlap with the first excited state since the corresponding wavefunction has a node at this point .",
    "however , a more reliable method to extract the ground state energy is to perform multiple exponential fits to a matrix of correlation functions obtained from different @xmath4 separations , where the different values of @xmath24 give rise to very different overlaps with the hybrid excited states in the off - diagonal elements of the matrix .",
    "for example , from figure  [ hybwave ] we see a suitable @xmath37 matrix can be formed from @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "considering the potential results we performed an initial calculation of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 hybrids using a staple size of @xmath38 and @xmath40 at both the source and the sink .",
    "figure  [ eff ] presents the results for the effective mass of the @xmath10 hybrid obtained from @xmath41 sources .",
    "there is a large contribution from excited states for this operator .",
    "however , a plateau seems to begin from timeslice @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "one - exponential fits in the region @xmath44 are in agreement with two - exponential fits with @xmath45 . considering all these fits",
    ", we find the ground state simulation energy to be consistent with @xmath46 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "this corresponds to a splitting with the @xmath47 @xmath6 state of @xmath48 in lattice units .",
    "we also find a splitting of @xmath49 with the @xmath11 states , which confirms that the @xmath1 is the lowest exotic hybrid .",
    "= 5.9 cm -1 cm    converting our results into physical units we obtain @xmath50  gev for the @xmath10 hybrid state .",
    "this is compared with the lower lying @xmath6 spectrum obtained from an @xmath51 nrqcd action  @xcite and also from a potential study , accurate to the same order in @xmath52  @xcite in figure  [ expt ] .",
    "our prediction lies @xmath53 above the threshold for @xmath8 production but @xmath53 below that for @xmath54 , which is predicted by flux tube models to be the dominant hybrid decay mode .",
    "a study by manke et al ..  @xcite using different operators on the same configurations finds consistent results with the @xmath10 hybrid lying @xmath53 higher .",
    "our results are also consistent with the predictions from the potential .",
    "the position of the hybrid state with respect to the two thresholds is not settled .",
    "an improved determination of the hybrid state is needed and we propose to do this by computing a matrix of correlators between different @xmath4 separations . at the moment",
    "the large statistical errors dominate the uncertainty in the prediction .",
    "however , the central value may be shifted significantly by finite volume effects and to a lesser extent quenching and the systematic errors associated with nrqcd .",
    "the computations were performed on the j90 at epcc in edinburgh as part of hpci under epserc grant no .",
