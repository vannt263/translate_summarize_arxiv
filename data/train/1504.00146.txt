    "intracellular calcium plays a major role in many signaling pathways , and regulates enzymatic activity , gene expression  @xcite , and neural activity @xcite . in order to control a variety of cell functions , cells control the local cytoplasmic calcium concentration via the exchange of ca@xmath0 ions with the extracellular space and the release of ca@xmath0 ions through channels situated on the membrane of reservoirs , such as the endoplasmic and the sarcoplasmic reticulum .",
    "modulation of the ca@xmath0 release regulates muscle contraction , pathway cross - talk and mitochondrial activity , and disruption of these processes is associated with various diseases such as early - onset alzheimer s  @xcite , heart failure  @xcite as well as psychological conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  @xcite .",
    "hence , detailed knowledge about the underlying processes governing this signaling mechanism is required to allow progress in our understanding of these diseases .    in this paper , we focus on the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) via inositol-4,5-triphosphate receptor ( ip@xmath1r ) channels . upon binding of ca@xmath0 to binding sites on its cytosolic part",
    ", a channel opens and calcium ions flow from the er into the cytoplasm .",
    "channels occur in clusters of 10 to 20 channels  @xcite .",
    "the opening of a single channel usually triggers the release of ca@xmath0 from other channels in the same cluster due to the increased ca@xmath0 concentration in their vicinity  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism results in a highly localized increase of the cytosolic calcium concentration .",
    "these `` puffs '' of calcium ions have been detected and analyzed in experiments by using fluorescent calcium buffers  @xcite .",
    "traditional modeling approaches of intracellular calcium dynamics are based on deterministic macroscopic rate equations  @xcite , however the intrinsically random , erratic nature of calcium signals in many cells or cell domains necessitates an approach going beyond the deterministic regime @xcite .",
    "progress has been made by recognizing the importance of number fluctuations in the binding to the channels  @xcite and using hybrid models , where the deterministic calcium concentration is coupled to stochastic channel binding models  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was found that local fluctuations stemming from diffusive noise ( i.e. noise originating from the random movement of ions ) have a crucial influence in calcium dynamics for clusters of intracellular channels , particularly in the inter - puff waiting time  @xcite but also on single - channel equilibrium behavior  @xcite .",
    "stochastic effects were also investigated for l - type calcium channels and ryr channels in the dyadic cleft  @xcite .",
    "other studies consider a langevin equation governing the fraction of open channels in a cluster  @xcite .",
    "however , tracking the exact diffusion of individual ions in the complete computational domain is computationally intensive .    here ,",
    "for the first time , we apply spatial stochastic multiscale methods to model the dynamics of calcium puffs including the release of ca@xmath0 from ip@xmath1r channels and track individual ion positions in order to accurately incorporate diffusive noise .",
    "we take into account both activating and inhibitory channel properties .",
    "we study the dynamics of the calcium concentration as a function of the ion binding affinities and explore the regime where there exist puffs , as well as the regime in which channels do not close after their first opening .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section  [ sec : model ] we discuss the spatial stochastic model for diffusion and channel gating used throughout this study .",
    "section  [ sec : multiscale ] discusses the multiscale approach we employ in order to reduce the computational effort required to track single ions and hence make this study feasible . in section  [ sec : results ] we present results on the statistics of puffs extracted from simulated time series data , and study the transition between perpetually - open channel clusters and the parameter regime in which puffs can be observed .",
    "in addition , we develop a mean - field model for channel dynamics and use it to extract the boundary between the regimes .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the spatial extent of our computational model consists of the three - dimensional domain @xmath2 which models a part of the intracellular space .",

    "free ca@xmath0 ions can bind to the activating and inhibitory sites , while bound ions can dissociate from occupied sites .",

    "ions become binding candidates as soon as they enter a half - sphere of radius @xmath21 around a binding site ( the channels are positioned on the er membrane , hence only the half - sphere above them is available for ion binding ) .",

    ", a deep inhibitory state is achieved owing to the large local nano - domain around each open channel displayed in the solution of deterministic calcium equations  @xcite .",

    "this effect has been termed self - inhibition @xcite .    in our simulations at large @xmath208",
    ", however , there is insufficient inhibition to the channels during the early phase of a puff .",
    "this means that no or perhaps only one subunit per channel binds inhibitory calcium , while reliable inhibition requires binding of three or four calcium ions .",
    "our results suggest that diffusive noise mixes calcium in the cluster domain and diminishes the localized domains around open channels and self - inhibition .",
    "thus we are led to a model of ca@xmath0 puffs that is very different from the previous hybrid model .",
    "our diffusive model allows inhibition only from a much less localized concentration profile and can therefore only be achieved at a much smaller dissociation constant of inhibitory binding sites .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the the mean - field ode model that we have devised and that captures the average binding state of the cluster s activating and inhibitory sites as well as the resulting ca@xmath0 concentration in a shared and well - mixed micro - domain . this model displays a sharp phase boundary between the two regimes , which agrees well with the data from our spatial simulations .    evidence for an inhomogeneous or homogeneous calcium distribution in the cluster is hard to obtain directly from our simulations because of the short lifetime of nano domains . in any case",
