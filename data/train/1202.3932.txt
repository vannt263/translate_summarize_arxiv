    "the microscopic study of nuclear many - body problem and the understanding of the nuclear interactions that reproduce the observed structure and reaction properties are the underlying challenges of low energy nuclear physics . in this context ,",
    "detailed investigations of the fusion process will lead to a better understanding of the interplay among the strong , coulomb , and weak interactions as well as the enhanced correlations present in these many - body systems .",
    "recently , particular experimental attention has been given to fusion reactions involving ca isotopes  @xcite .",
    "these new experiments supplemented the older fusion data  @xcite and extended it to lower sub - barrier energies .",
    "comparison of the sub - barrier cross - sections with those calculated using standard coupled - channel calculations suggested a hindrance of the fusion cross - sections at deep sub - barrier energies  @xcite .",
    "one of the underlying reasons for the failure of standard coupled - channel approach is the use of frozen densities in the calculation of double - folding potentials , resulting in potentials that behave in a completely unphysical manner for deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "while the outer part of the barrier is largely determined by the early entrance channel properties of the collision , the inner part of the potential barrier is strongly sensitive to dynamical effects such as particle transfer and neck formation .",
    "this has been remedied in part by extensions of the coupled - channel approach to include a repulsive core  @xcite or the incorporation of neck degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "more recent calculations  @xcite using the coupled - channel approach with a repulsive core have provided much improved fits to the data . a detailed microscopic study of the fusion process for ca based reactions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 could provide further insight into the reaction dynamics as well as a good testing ground for the theory since these isotopes are commonly used in fitting the parameters of the effective nuclear interactions , such as the skyrme force .",
    "during the past several years , we have developed a microscopic approach for calculating heavy - ion interaction potentials that incorporates all of the dynamical entrance channel effects included in the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) description of the collision process  @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the tdhf evolution of the nuclear system coupled with density - constrained hartree - fock calculations ( dc - tdhf ) to obtain the ion - ion interaction potential .",
    "the formalism was applied to study fusion cross - sections for the systems @xmath4sn+@xmath5ni  @xcite , @xmath5ni+@xmath5ni  @xcite , @xmath6o+@xmath7pb  @xcite , @xmath8sn+@xmath9zr  @xcite , as well as to the study of the entrance channel dynamics of hot and cold fusion reactions leading to superheavy element @xmath10  @xcite , and dynamical excitation energies  @xcite . in all cases",
    ", we have found good agreement between the measured fusion cross sections and the dc - tdhf results .",
    "this is rather remarkable given the fact that the only input in dc - tdhf is the skyrme effective n - n interaction , and there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "in section  [ sec : formalism ] we outline the main features of our microscopic approach , the dc - tdhf method . in section  [ sec : formalism ] we also discuss the calculation of ion - ion separation distance , coordinate - dependent mass , calculation of fusion cross - sections , and giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) formalism . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we present interesting aspects of the reaction dynamics and compare our results with experiment and other calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in the dc - tdhf approach  @xcite the tdhf time - evolution takes place with no restrictions . at certain times during the evolution the instantaneous density is used to perform a static hartree - fock minimization while holding the neutron and proton densities constrained to be the corresponding instantaneous tdhf densities  @xcite .",
    "in essence , this provides us with the tdhf dynamical path in relation to the multi - dimensional static energy surface of the combined nuclear system . the advantages of this method in comparison to other mean - field based microscopic methods such as the constrained hartree - fock ( chf ) method are obvious .",
    "first , there is no need to introduce artificial constraining operators which assume that the collective motion is confined to the constrained phase space : second , the static adiabatic approximation is replaced by the dynamical analogue where the most energetically favorable state is obtained by including sudden rearrangements and the dynamical system does not have to move along the valley of the potential energy surface . in short",
    "we have a self - organizing system which selects its evolutionary path by itself following the microscopic dynamics .",
    "all of the dynamical features included in tdhf are naturally included in the dc - tdhf calculations .",
    "these effects include neck formation , mass exchange , internal excitations , deformation effects to all order , as well as the effect of nuclear alignment for deformed systems . in the dc - tdhf method the ion - ion interaction potential",
    "is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density - constrained energy at the instantaneous separation @xmath13 , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the binding energies of the two nuclei obtained with the same effective interaction .",
    "in writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : vr ] ) we have introduced the concept of an adiabatic reference state for a given tdhf state . the difference between these two energies represents the internal energy .",
    "the adiabatic reference state is the one obtained via the density constraint calculation , which is the slater determinant with lowest energy for the given density with vanishing current and approximates the collective potential energy  @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that this procedure does not affect the tdhf time - evolution and contains no free parameters or normalization .",
    "in addition to the ion - ion potential it is also possible to obtain coordinate dependent mass parameters .",
    "one can compute the `` effective mass '' @xmath16 using the conservation of energy @xmath17}{\\dot{r}^{2}}\\ ; , \\label{eq : mr}\\ ] ] where the collective velocity @xmath18 is directly obtained from the tdhf evolution and the potential @xmath19 from the density constraint calculations . in calculating fusion cross - sections this coordinate - dependent mass",
    "is used to obtain a transformed ion - ion potential as described below .",
    "the calculation of the excitation energy is achieved by dividing the tdhf motion into a collective and intrinsic part .",
    "the major assumption in achieving this goal is to assume that the collective part is primarily determined by the density @xmath20 and the current @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , the excitation energy can be formally written as  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total energy of the dynamical system , which is a conserved quantity , and @xmath24 represents the collective energy of the system . in the next step",
    "we break up the collective energy into two parts @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the kinetic part and is given by @xmath27 which is asymptotically equivalent to the kinetic energy of the relative motion , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the reduced mass and @xmath13 is the ion - ion separation distance .",
    "the dynamics of the ion - ion separation @xmath13 is provided by an unrestricted tdhf run thus allowing us to deduce the excitation energy as a function of the distance parameter , @xmath30 .      in practice",
    ", tdhf runs are initialized with energies above the coulomb barrier at some large but finite separation .",
    "the two ions are boosted with velocities obtained by assuming that the two nuclei arrive at this initial separation on a coulomb trajectory .",
    "initially the nuclei are placed such that the point @xmath32 in the @xmath33 plane is the center of mass . during the tdhf dynamics the ion - ion separation distance is obtained by constructing a dividing plane between the two centers and calculating the center of the densities on the left and right halves of this dividing plane .",
    "the coordinate @xmath31 is the difference between the two centers . the dividing plane is determined by finding the point at which the tails of the two densities intersect each other along the @xmath34-axis . since the actual mesh used in the tdhf calculations is relatively coarse we use a cubic - spline interpolation to interpolate the profile in the x - direction and search for a more precise intersection value . this procedure has been recently described in ref .",
    "@xcite in great detail .",
    "the standard procedure for calculating @xmath31 as described above starts to fail after a substantial overlap is reached ( for @xmath31 values smaller than the ones studied in this manuscript ) .",
    "we have observed that if one defines the ion - ion separation as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass quadrupole moment for the entire system , calculated by using the collision axis as the symmetry axis , and @xmath37 is a scale factor determined to give the correct initial separation distance at the start of the calculations . calculating @xmath31 this way yields almost identical results to the previous procedure until that procedure begins to fail and continues smoothly after that point .",
    "of course the minimum value of @xmath31 calculated this way is never zero but is determined by the quadrupole moment of the composite system .",
    "we now outline the calculation of the total fusion cross section using an arbitrary coordinate - dependent mass @xmath16 . starting from the classical lagrange function @xmath38",
    "we obtain the corresponding hamilton function @xmath39 where the canonical momentum is given by @xmath40 . following the standard quantization procedure for the kinetic energy in curvilinear",

    "this approach was used to calculate excitation energies for various systems , including the excitation energy of the heavy systems leading to superheavy formations  @xcite . here",
    ", we have shown that what is also important is the excitation of the system at the point of capture , which is a deciding factor for forming a composite system or fusion - fission .",
    "this is different than excitation of the compound nucleus , which determines the survival of the system from quasi - fission .",
    "the dynamical excitation energies calculated from dc - tdhf are relative to an unequilibrated composite system rather than a true compound nucleus .",
    "( color online ) excitation energy , @xmath121 , as a function of the ion - ion separation distance , @xmath31 , for the three systems studied here.,width=325 ]    the systems studied in this manuscript present interesting target - projectile combinations for studying excitations .",
    "for example , the non - symmetric @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system will have a pre - equilibrium gdr excitation in comparison to the other two symmetric systems , as well as particle transfer .",
    "naturally , some of these effects are included in the fusion barriers obtained via the dc - tdhf method , as they influence the change in the tdhf density used in the density constraint calculation .",
    "the quantity @xmath122 calculated from via tdhf and dc - tdhf represents the average of dynamical excitations present in the mean - field theory , with the exception of excitations not determined by the nuclear density and current ( such as the spin currents ) .",
    "another point to consider is the pairing interaction .",
    "it has been a general consensus that during a heavy - ion collision the effects of pairing are washed away due to the high excitations . in this particular case paring effects are minimal for the initial ca nuclei studied . however , even if the pairing can be ignored during the collision process , in many cases it plays an important role for obtaining good initial hf states as well as obtaining realistic density constraint solutions when a single composite is formed .",
    "fortunately , the latter case corresponds to the region of barrier minimum and not the region around the barrier peak where most fusion cross - sections are measured .",

    "[ fig : fig10 ] we plot the average number of neutrons and protons transferred during the early stages of the tdhf collision of the @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system at @xmath125  mev .",
    "the solid lines denote the neutrons and protons asymptotically belonging to the @xmath91ca nucleus and dashed lines to the @xmath74ca nucleus .",
    "a number of interesting things can be observed from the plot ; first is the fact that most of the transfer seems to start after we pass the potential barrier peak .",
    "this indicates that particle transfer primarily modifies the inner part of the barrier and not so much the barrier height .",
    "the other observation is that on average about three neutrons are transferred from @xmath91ca to @xmath74ca but there is also a small amount of proton transfer in the opposite direction .",
    "( color online ) power spectrum of the isovector dipole amplitude @xmath124 for the @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system is shown for various time - intervals , width=325 ]    figure  [ fig : fig11 ] shows the excitation energy , @xmath121 , for the three systems studies here .",
    "the excitation energy was calculated for the same value of @xmath126  mev for all systems , which corresponds to collision energies of @xmath101 , @xmath88 , and @xmath127  mev , respectively .",
    "all curves initially behave in a similar manner , at large distances the excitation is zero , as the nuclei approach the barrier peak the excitations start and monotonically rise for larger overlaps .",
    "the interesting observation is that the excitations for the intermediary @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system start at a slightly earlier time and rise above the other two systems . this may be largely due to the fact that an asymmetric system has some additional modes of excitation in comparison to the other two symmetric systems",
    ". it may be plausible to consider the direct influence of the excitation energy , @xmath121 , on the fusion barriers by making an analogy with the coupled - channel approach and construct a new potential @xmath128 , which has all the excitations added to the ion - ion potential @xmath19 that should be calculated at higher energies to minimize the nuclear rearrangements ( frozen - density limit ) .",
    "the resulting potentials somewhat resemble the repulsive - core coupled - channel potentials of ref .",
    "this approach does lead to improvements in cases where most of the excitation energy is in the form of collective excitations rather than irreversible stochastic dissipation ( true especially for lighter systems ) .",
    "for the cases studied here we do see a small improvement for the fusion cross - sections of the @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system .",
    "the viability of this approach requires further examination and will be studied in the future .",
    "one of the excitation modes for the @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system , namely the particle transfer , was already discussed above .",
    "the others are various isovector modes such as the pre - equilibrium gdr excitation . in fig .",

    "the time - evolution of the deformation @xmath123 is very similar for all three systems except at larger times the @xmath74ca+@xmath91ca system moves toward smaller deformation in comparison to the other two systems .",
    "this is again most likely due to increased excitations that drive the system toward a more compact shape .",
    "the evolution of the dipole operator @xmath124 shows little damping over a long time interval . the power spectrum associated with this time time - evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] .",
    "we have evaluated the spectrum for different time - intervals .",
    "the broadest curve corresponds to a very early stage of the collision , @xmath132  fm/@xmath131 , but has the lowest amplitude ( multiplied by @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] ) . in the second interval , @xmath134  fm/@xmath131",
    ", we see the development of various peaks and an increase in amplitude .",
    "the spectrum for the entire time interval , @xmath135  fm/@xmath131 , is dominated by a sharp peak around @xmath136  mev , which is primarily originating from the later stages of the collision which is evident if one compares it to the spectrum from the interval @xmath137  fm/@xmath131 .",
    "in this manuscript we have provided a microscopic study of ca@xmath138ca fusion using the dc - tdhf approach .",
    "these reactions have recently been of considerable interest for the fusion community with a flurry of phenomenological analyses of the fusion data . here , we have provided a microscopic alternative to this analysis .",
    "we have shown that microscopically obtained ion - ion potentials do give a reasonably good description of the fusion cross - sections .    the fully microscopic tdhf theory has shown itself to be rich in nuclear phenomena and continues to stimulate our understanding of nuclear dynamics .",
    "the time - dependent mean - field studies seem to show that the dynamic evolution builds up correlations that are not present in the static theory . while modern skyrme forces provide a much better description of static nuclear properties in comparison to the earlier parametrizations",
