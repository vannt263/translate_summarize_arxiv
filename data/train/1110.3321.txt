    "several groups have conducted systematic searches of mgii absorption features in sdss qso spectra , producing a large sample of these absorbers for constraining their statistical properties ( e.g.  bouch et al .",

    "mgii absorbers are routinely found in the vicinities ( @xmath9 kpc ) of distant galaxies and provide a convenient probe of galactic halos at high redshifts ( e.g.  bergeron 1986 ; steidel et al .",

    "2008 ; chen & tinker 2008 ; gauthier & chen 2011 ) .",
    "however , their physical origin , whether the absorbers arise in infalling clouds , outflows from nearby star - forming regions , or a combination thereof , is unclear .",
    "the ubiquitous presence of blueshifted mgii absorption features along the sightlines into the star - forming regions of @xmath10 galaxies indicates that starburst driven outflows are common in distant galaxies and that outflows contribute to some fraction of mgii absorbers uncovered along random qso sightlines ( e.g.  weiner et al .",
    "2009 ; rubin et al .",
    "although the extent of galactic - scale winds around these galaxies is unknown , the observed self - absorption of mgii doublets in distant star - forming galaxies has motivated recent works that attribute all strong mgii absorbers ( rest - frame absorption equivalent width @xmath11  ) along qso sightlines to outflows ( e.g.  mnard & chelouche 2009 ; chelouche & bowen 2010 ; mnard et al .",

    "in addition , m11 showed that the frequency distribution function of mgii absorbers and the [ oii ] luminosity function share similar shape and amplitude , and that the number density evolution of mgii absorbers follows the cosmic star formation history . combining these empirical correlations",
    ", the authors argue that outflows are the mechanism responsible for the observed mgii absorption in qso spectra .",
    "the conclusion of outflows being responsible for the observed mgii absorbers appears to be discrepant from previous findings that correlates more strongly with galaxy mass and weakly with galaxy colors or recent star formation history ( e.g.  steidel et al .",
    "1994 ; chen et al .",

    "emission features in the qso spectrum .",
    "galaxies with gaseous halos intercepting the qso sightline are expected to imprint mgii absorption features in the qso spectrum . in this picture , the optical disks of galaxies @xmath26 and @xmath27 are covered by the fiber ( in part or in full ) , galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not . only @xmath26 and @xmath27",

    "because models which do not require outflows can also reproduce the empirical correlations between absorber abundances and star formation properties , we caution drawing conclusions in favor of an outflow origin for qso absorbers based on these simple correlations . throughout this paper , we adopt a @xmath33cdm cosmology with @xmath34 and @xmath35 and a dimensionless hubble constant of @xmath36 .",
