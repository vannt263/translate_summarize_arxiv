    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary systems which contain a white dwarf primary star that accretes material from a roche lobe - filling late - type main sequence secondary star . the secondary star s surface contacts its roche lobe through angular momentum loss and initiates ballistic mass transfer to the white dwarf through the inner lagrange point @xmath2 .",
    "the mass transfer that occurs at this point is mostly stable and causes the ` _ cataclysmic _ ' phenomenon .",
    "if the white dwarf retains enough of the accreted material , it can exceed the chandrasekhar limit and become a type ia supernova .",
    "thus , cvs have a broad importance for studying the physics of the accretion process in detail , in constraining models of stellar evolution , binary evolution , and the chemical enrichment of the galaxy .",
    "although cvs have been observed for more than 100 years ( e.g. cannizzo 2012 ) , _ kepler _ provided essentially uninterrupted observations of sources for months or years which allowed the outburst properties of cvs to be studied in a way not previously possible . since the launch of _ kepler _",
    ", we have pursued a programme to study a range of cvs in the _ kepler _ field of view ( there are several dozen , see howell et al .",
    "2013 and scaringi et al .",

    "one source in the _ kepler _ field , boks 45906 ( kic 9778689 , @xmath3 @xmath4 j2000.0 , taken from the kepler int survey ) , was identified as a blue source in the burrell - optical - kepler - survey ( boks ) which was a pre - launch survey of the central region of the _ kepler _ field of view .",
    "boks 45906 was seen to undergo what appeared to be a typical dwarf nova outburst , rising from a quiescent magnitude of @xmath5=20 to 16.5 and lasting for about 5 d. a subsequent study by howell ( unpublished ) over the past few years has shown boks 45906 to reside near @xmath6=22.5 and no further outbursts such as detected by feldmeier et al .",

    "1999 ) which is 3.5@xmath7 distant from the optical position of boks 45906 .    as part of a broader programme to study cvs ( and accreting objects in general ) in nasa s _ kepler _ field of view , we added boks 45906 to our _ kepler _ programme . in this paper",
    "we present the _ kepler _ data of boks 45906 with additional data obtained using the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , _ swift _ , and the hale 200@xmath7 telescope , and discuss its likely nature .",
    "the _ kepler int survey _ ( kis , greiss et al .",
    "2012a , b ) obtained @xmath8h@xmath9 photometry of the vast majority of sources in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "the photometry and colours of boks 45906 are @xmath10=19.85 , @xmath11=1.24 , @xmath12=0.44 , @xmath13=0.42 and @xmath14h@xmath9=1.22 indicating it has colours consistent with those of cvs ( figure [ kiscolours ] ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ data imply that these kis observations took place when the source was in a high optical state (  3 ) . although the kis multi - colour observations took place within 8 min of each other , our int observations ( cf  [ int - phot ] ) indicate that some degree of caution should be taken since it can change brightness by up to 0.4 mag on this timescale .",

    "it is sensitive over the range 0.2 - 10 kev and has an effective area of @xmath070 @xmath16 at 1 kev ( for comparison the _ rosat _ xrt had an effective area of @xmath0400 @xmath16 at 1 kev ) .",
    "we examined data taken in ` photon counting ' mode and used the products derived from the standard xrt pipeline .",
    "since the count rate of boks 45906 was low we created an image using all the xrt data in photon counting mode .",
    "this image was input to the heasoft tool ximage and the routine sosta ( which takes into account effects such as vignetting , exposure and the point spread function ) to determine the count rate and error at the optical position of boks 45906 .",
    "the total exposure was 14.1ks and the count rate was 6.2@xmath17 cts / s giving a signal to noise of 2.0 .",
    "it was therefore detected at a low significance .      the ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot ) on board the _ swift _ satellite has a 30 cm primary mirror and 6 optical / uv filters ( roming et al .",
    "2005 ) . since _ swift",
    "_ operates a ` filter of the day ' , we were not able to pre - define the filter , but images were obtained in the u ( central wavelength 347 nm , and a full width half maximum of 79 nm ) , uvw1 ( 251 nm , 70 nm ) , uvm2 filter ( 225 nm , 50 nm ) , and the uvw2 ( 188 nm , 76 nm ) filters .",
    "boks 45906 was detected only in the uvw2 filter ( the filter with the bluest response ) and then at a very low count rate : 0.020@xmath10.003 ct / s which corresponds to a flux of 1.23@xmath18 ergs s@xmath19 @xmath20@xmath19 .",
    "the _ kepler _ observations of boks 45906 cover a time interval of nearly 3 years during which its optical flux varies by a factor of @xmath06 .",
    "this together with the fact that it is detected as a very weak x - ray and uv source , and shows balmer emission lines , all point to the fact that boks 45906 is an accreting source . during the low optical state",
    "there is a strong peak in the power spectrum corresponding to a period of 56.56 min .",
    "given that we can phase all of the _ kepler _ sc data on a common ephemeris , this strongly suggests that 56.56 min is the orbital period of an accreting binary system ( other periods which may be expected , such as a super - hump period , would not be expected to be as stable ) .    as cvs evolve over time their orbital period decreases due to the loss of orbital angular momentum from the system .",
    "however , at some point , the mass of the secondary star becomes so small that hydrogen burning in the core stops and it becomes semi - degenerate .",
    "the radius of the secondary will thereafter start to increase and the orbital period starts to increase again . this period",
    "` bounce ' is predicted to occur at @xmath065-70 min ( rappaport et al .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "there are , however , two groups of helium rich accreting binary systems which have orbital periods shorter than 70 min .",
    "the ` am cvn ' binaries , have orbital periods between @xmath0570 min and spectra devoid of hydrogen . given we",
    "detect balmer lines in its spectrum , boks 45906 can not be an am cvn system",
    ". a much smaller group of accreting binaries are also known which show strong helium and hydrogen lines and also show outbursts ( e.g. breedt et al .",
    "2012 , carter et al .",
    "it is thought that these ` helium rich ' binaries may evolve to become am cvn systems over time .",
    "although our optical spectra are low signal - to - noise we do not see any clear evidence for helium lines . however , other cvs below the period minimum such as ei psc which has an orbital period of 64 min ( thorstensen et al 2002 ) show relatively weak helium emission lines , which could well be hidden in low signal - to - noise spectra",
    ".    breedt et al . (",
    "2012 ) give an overview of the accreting binaries with an orbital period less than 76 min .",
    "of the 42 then known systems , 36 of these are am cvn binaries and 3 are confirmed ( and another 3 candidate ) hydrogen accreting systems . finding another candidate hydrogen accreting binary with an orbital period less than 76",
    "min is clearly of great interest from a binary evolutionary point of view .",
    "the next step is to obtain time resolved spectra of boks 45906 when it is in a bright optical state to confirm that 56.56 min is indeed the binary orbital period .",
    "we have identified one object in the _ kepler _ field , boks 45906 , which shows a series of outbursts which can reach @xmath02 mag in amplitude .",
    "using sc data when the source is in a low state , we find evidence for a flux variation on a period of 56.56 min .",
    "although this period is close to twice the exposure time of the lc data , we consider it unlikely that this period is an artifact in the data . since we can phase the sc data on a common ephemeris it strongly points to the fact that the 56.56 min period is a signature of the orbital period . as this period is below the short period minimum of hydrogen",
    "accreting cvs , boks 45906 may be a helium - rich cataclysmic variable .",
    "the _ kepler _ light curve of boks 45906 provides a unique insight to the accretion history of a helium - rich cv over a 3 year timescale .",
    "phase resolved spectroscopic observations of boks 45906 are required when the system is in a bright optical state to verify that the 56.56 min period is the orbital period .",
