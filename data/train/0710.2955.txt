    "most pulsar surveys have been carried out with single dish telescopes where there is a trade - off between the collecting area and the beam - width , and consequently the rate of the survey . in a multi - element telescope such as the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt )",
    ", a large number of smaller antennas can be combined to provide a high sensitivity and yet retain a relatively large beam - width . in this paper",
    ", we report on the discovery of three new pulsars in the first blind survey of the north galactic plane ( 45@xmath1 < l < 135@xmath1 ; |b| <",
    "1@xmath1 ) with the gmrt at an intermediate frequency of 610 mhz , which represents the best trade - off between the increased flux density at low frequency for pulsars , interstellar scattering and dispersion and beam - width .",
    "the gmrt s multi - element nature was also exploited to determine the positions of the pulsars to an accuracy of 5 arcminutes and this technique is also described .",
    "the survey consists of 300 fields .",
    "the observations were conducted using typically 20 to 25 45-m gmrt antennas combined in an incoherent array mode at a frequency of 610 mhz .",
    "each 43 by 43 field in this mode was observed for 35 minutes with a bandwidth of 16 mhz with 256 spectral channel across the band .",
    "the data in each channel were acquired with 16-bit precision every 256 @xmath2s after summing the two polarizations and recorded to sdlt tapes for off - line processing .",
    "the 8 sigma threshold for detecting a pulsed signal with a duty cycle of 10 percent for the configuration used is 0.5 mjy , which is comparable to the sensitivity of the parkes multibeam survey ( manchester et al .",
    "the pulsar candidates were confirmed in the follow - up observations with the gmrt using the same observing configuration as used for the survey .",
    "the pulsar position was localized exploiting the multi - element nature of the gmrt .",
    "the range of baselines available for the gmrt antennas allows forming beams with a range of beam - widths when appropriate antennas are combined as a phased array to form an equivalent single dish with similar sensitivity as a 20 antenna incoherent array .",
    "three combinations of the nearest 3 , 5 and 6 antennas respectively were used in this mode to observe the candidate field and four fields offset in right ascension and declination by half of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for the respective array .",
    "the respective fwhm in the above configurations were 20 , 10 and 5 arcminutes .",
    "the detected signal - to - noise ratio of each new pulsar in these gridding observations was used to refine the position successively to 5 arcminutes accuracy .",
    "the refined position was used for timing observations at 1420 mhz with the lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory .",
    "this allowed follow - up confirmation and timing studies with high sensitivity with the lovell telescope and a rapid determination of pulsar parameters .",
    "the data were analyzed using the pulsar searching package sigproc ( http://sigproc.sourceforge.net ) .",
    "the data were dedispersed using 145 trial dispersion measures ( dm ) ranging from 0 to 2000 pc @xmath3 , with spacing determined by the dispersion smearing across each individual frequency channel .",
    "periodicities were searched for using both a fast fourier transform and a fast folding algorithm .",
    "known interference frequencies were eliminated and new pulsar candidates were identified through inspection of diagnostic plots . a single - pulse search was also performed ; due to the large amount of impulsive interference in our data , the results of this search are still under analysis .",
    "out of 300 fields observed so far , we have processed 214 fields , covering about 100 square degrees of sky and redetected 11 known pulsars .",
    "three new pulsars , psrs j0026 + 6320 , j2208 + 5500 and j2218 + 5729 , have been discovered so far .",
    "the discovery plots of the new pulsars alongwith their average profiles observed at the gmrt and lovell telescope are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the observed parameters of the new pulsars are given in table 1 .",
    "the entire data is being reprocessed with better radio frequency interference excision to look for sources similar to recently reported rotating radio transient ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) , for which the parameters of this survey are particularly suitable .",
    "we are also extending the survey area to ( 45@xmath1 < l < 165@xmath1 ; |b| < 3@xmath1 ) and plan to complete these observations in the coming months ."
