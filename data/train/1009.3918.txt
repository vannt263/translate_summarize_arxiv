    "a fundamental question in the study of strongly correlated systems concerns how a quantum many - particle system prepared in an initial state which is not an exact eigenstate of the hamiltonian evolves in time , and under what conditions the system at long times thermalizes as opposed to reaching a novel athermal state .",
    "@xcite this question is particularly relevant now due to experiments in cold - atomic gases which provide practical realizations of almost ideal many - particle systems where the interaction between particles and the external potentials acting on them can be changed rapidly in time .",
    "@xcite    motivated by this , there has been considerable theoretical interest in studying the time - evolution of one - dimensional systems which are initially prepared in a spatially inhomogeneous state by the application of external confining potentials .",
    "nonequilibrium time - evolution is triggered when the external potentials are rapidly turned off which may be accompanied with a rapid change in the interaction between particles . for example , the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) has been used to study the time - evolution of a domain wall in the xxz spin - chain ,  @xcite the conformal field theory approach to study domain wall time evolution in the transverse - field ising chain at the gapless point ,  @xcite and the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba ) to study loschmidt echos for the xxz chain for an initial domain wall state .",
    "@xcite aba has also been used to study geometric quenches i.e. , the time - evolution arising after two spatially separated regions have been coupled together .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of hard - core bosons after an initial confining potential was switched off was studied in ref .  .",
    "here it was found that the initial energy of confinement resulted in the appearance of quasi - condensates at finite momentum .",
    "time - evolution of an initial density inhomogeneity after an interaction quench at the luther - emery point was studied in ref .   where a power - law amplification of the initial density profile was found .",
    "in this paper we study how a one - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) system prepared initially in a domain wall state corresponding to a density @xmath1 , ( where @xmath2 is the coordinate along the chain , and @xmath3 is a constant ) evolves in time after a sudden interaction and potential quench .",
    "the @xmath0d system is modeled using the quantum sine - gordon ( qsg ) model which captures the low energy physics of a variety of one - dimensional systems such as the spin-1/2 chain , interacting fermions with back - scattering interactions arising due to umpklapp processes , and interacting bosons in an optical lattice .",
    "@xcite    the qsg model is integrable , its exact solution can be obtained using bethe - ansatz .",
    "@xcite while this property has been exploited to a great extent to understand equilibrium properties of many @xmath0d systems , extending bethe - ansatz to study dynamics is a daunting task , especially for the time - evolution of two - point correlation functions .",
    "thus there is a necessity to develop approximate methods to study this model .",
    "here we investigate the time - evolution of the qsg model semiclassically using the truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) to which quantum corrections are added in order to set limits on its applicability .",
    "@xcite moreover our parameter regime corresponds to an interacting bose gas whose density is initially in the form of a domain wall . we study how this initial state evolves in time as a result of a sudden switching on of an optical lattice , which may or may not be accompanied by an interaction quench .",
    "an optical lattice is a source of back - scattering interactions or umpklapp processes , that tends to localize the bosons .",
    "our aim is to understand how this physics affects the time - evolution of the domain wall state .",
    "note that domain walls like the one we study here have been created experimentally by subjecting equal mixtures of @xmath4 atoms in two different hyperfine states to an external magnetic field gradient .",
    "@xcite studying quantum dynamics in such systems may soon be experimentally feasible .",
    "one consequence of quenched dynamics in integrable models is that the system often does not thermalize , with the long time behavior depending non - trivially on the initial state .",
    "here we find that an initial state in the form of a domain wall evolves at long times into a current carrying state even in the presence of a back - scattering interaction of moderate strength .",
    "moreover , this net current flow has interesting consequences for the behavior of two - point correlation functions .",
    "the lack of decay of current found here is consistent with the fact that the dc conductivity of a 1d system is infinite even in the presence of back - scattering or umpklapp processes .",
    "@xcite the origin of the infinite conductivity is the large number of conserved quantities in a 1d system , where some of them have a nonzero overlap with the current ,  @xcite thus preventing an initial current carrying state from decaying to zero .",
    "we also justify the steady state current obtained from twa by studying the qsg model at the luther - emery point .",
    "the luther - emery point is an exactly solvable point in the gapped phase of the model .",
    "in particular we study how an initial current carrying state evolves with time and find that a steady state current ( albeit of reduced magnitude ) persists at long times .",
    "we also study how this current affects two - point correlation functions .    since the qsg model is a simplified model that neglects band - curvature and higher - order back - scattering or umpklapp processes , an important question concerns to what extent it can capture quenched dynamics in realistic systems .",
    "the nonequilibrium time - evolution of the above domain wall initial state was studied both for the exactly - solvable lattice model of the @xmath5 spin chain , and its continuum counterpart , the luttinger model .",
    "@xcite the study of the density and various two - point correlation functions revealed that both the lattice and the continuum model reached the same nonequilibrium steady state , but differed in the details of the time - evolution .",
    "continuum theories are far easier to handle both numerically and analytically than their lattice counterparts . therefore to what extent they can capture the steady state behavior after a quench for general parameters is an open and important question which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ twa ]",
    "we study the time evolution of an initial domain wall state after a quench employing twa .",
    "results for the density , current and two - point correlation functions are presented . in section  [ twaqc ]",
    "we present results for the first quantum corrections to twa for some representative cases and discuss the general applicability of the twa results . in section  [ le ]",
    "we present results for a quench at the exactly solvable luther - emery point for an initial current carrying state .",
    "here results for the steady - state current as well as two - point correlation functions are presented .",
    "section  [ conc ] contains our conclusions .",

    "we study the case where at time @xmath22=@xmath23 the external field @xmath14 is switched off . at the same time",
    "an optical - lattice is suddenly switched on which may be accompanied by an change in the interaction between bosons . thus the time evolution for @xmath24 is due to the quantum sine - gordon model , @xmath25 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - g\\int dx \\cos\\left(\\gamma \\phi(x)\\right)\\label{hf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath26=@xmath27 , @xmath28 being the luttinger parameter and @xmath29 the strength of the back - scattering interaction arising due to a periodic potential .",
    "the ground state of @xmath30 has two well known phases ,  @xcite the localized ( gapped ) phase characterized by @xmath31 , and a delocalized ( gapless ) phase .",
    "the periodic potential is a relevant parameter for @xmath32 , implying that the ground state has a gap for infinitesimally small @xmath29 . on the other hand for @xmath33 ,",
    "a localized phase arises only for back - scattering strengths larger than a critical value ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we will study quenched dynamics for parameters that are such that @xmath29 is a relevant perturbation in equilibrium .",
    "note that the initial domain wall state is not an exact eigen - state of @xmath30 .",
    "neither is it related to the classical solitonic solution of the qsg model since the latter is a domain wall in the @xmath35 field ,  @xcite while our initial state is a domain wall in @xmath36 .    when @xmath29=@xmath23 , the time evolution of the system can be solved exactly .",
    "@xcite for this case an initial density inhomogeneity shows typical light - cone dynamics  @xcite by spreading out ballistically in either direction with the velocity @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37=@xmath38 $ ] .",
    "since the system is closed , the energy is conserved .",
    "however during the course of the time - evolution , the energy density is transferred from the density to the current , the latter having the form @xmath39\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular for @xmath14=@xmath40 , the energy density at @xmath22=@xmath23 is @xmath41=@xmath42 , while at long times , and for positions within the light - cone ( @xmath43 ) the energy density is @xmath41=@xmath44 where @xmath45=@xmath46 .",
    "note that while any initial density profile will give rise to transient currents , the special feature of a domain wall density profile is that for a system of infinite length , the steady state behavior is characterized by a net current flow .",
    "in particular for any finite time the current flows across a length @xmath47 of the wire connecting the regions of high and low densities @xmath48 at the two ends .",
    "we now explore how the time - evolution of the density , and the long time behavior of the current and two - point correlation functions is influenced by a back - scattering interaction ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the results are obtained using twa which involves solving the classical equations of motion with initial conditions weighted by the wigner distribution function of the initial state .",

    "there is a clear appearance of a current carrying steady state whose magnitude decreases with @xmath29 .",

    "note that when @xmath70 , the current does not commute with @xmath30 .",
    "yet the system reaches a current carrying steady state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the qsg model has a large number of other conserved quantities , some of which have a nonzero overlap with the current operator , thus preventing the current to decay to zero .",
    "the lack of decay of an initial current carrying state is also the origin of an infinite conductivity in many integrable systems .  @xcite it was argued in ref .   that at least two different non - commuting umpklapp processes are needed to violate conservation laws sufficiently so as to render the conductivity finite and thus cause the current to decay to zero .",
    "in this subsection we will study the following two equal time two - point correlation functions , @xmath71 these are found to reach a nonequilibrium steady state for a time @xmath72 , _ i.e. _ for observation points that are within the light - cone .",

    "the physical reason for the spatial oscillations when @xmath82 is the dephasing of the variable canonically conjugate to the density as the domain wall broadens .",
    "this implies a dephasing of transverse spin components in the @xmath5 spin chain resulting in a spin - wave pattern at wavelength @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite for a system of hard - core bosons , oscillations in @xmath73 has the physical interpretation of the appearance of quasi - condensates at wave - vector @xmath84=@xmath85 .",
    "@xcite    the twa results presented here show that these effects can persist even in the presence of a back - scattering interaction , at least within the continuum model .",
    "in particular fig .",
    "[ cxxg ] shows that when @xmath49 , @xmath73 retains the spatially oscillating form albeit at a wavelength that increases with increasing @xmath29 . just as for @xmath29=@xmath23 ,",

    "further unlike @xmath73 , @xmath90 has no memory of the initial spatial inhomogeneity for @xmath65 .",
    "however this is no longer the case for nonzero @xmath29 .",
    "[ czzg ] shows that for small @xmath29 , @xmath90 can also show spatial oscillations .",
    "moreover , there is no appearance of long - range order until @xmath29 is @xmath95 , where the appearance of the ising gap corresponds to a nonzero asymptotic behavior of the two - point correlation function .",
    "it is also consistent that the appearance of the gap in @xmath90 coincides with the value of @xmath29 for which the domain wall is almost static in fig .",

    "@xcite thus the @xmath30 parameters considered here are those for which the ground state is the gapped ising phase for @xmath29 of any strength .",
    "yet there is no signature of the gap in the quenched dynamics for @xmath69 . for this case",
    "the domain wall motion is ballistic , and the @xmath73 correlations persist over longer distances than in the gapped ising phase .",
    "similar observations have also been made in the study of an interaction quench both in the bose - hubbard model  @xcite and for a system of interacting fermions  @xcite where it was found that the system continued to show light - cone dynamics and gapless behavior for parameters that correspond to the equilibrium gapped phase .",
    "the time - evolution of the density and current in the xxz chain for an initial domain wall state was studied in ref .",
    "employing tdmrg .",
    "there it was found that while a current persists within the gapless phase , it decayed to zero in the gapped phase .",
    "this result is different from what we find here where the current persists in the gapped phase as long as @xmath29 is not too large .",
    "there could be two reasons for this difference .",
    "firstly the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 that we use here , do not correspond to the parameters of the xxz chain .",
    "secondly , it is possible that the irrelevant operators that are not retained in the continuum model modify the long - time behavior , even though this was not found to be the case at the exactly solvable xx point ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) .",
    "an important question concerns the validity of twa .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that in writing the time - evolution of an interacting system as a keldysh path integral , twa is the leading correction in powers of @xmath50 .",
    "one may therefore check its validity by expanding the path integral in higher powers of @xmath50 , and identify when these contributions become significant .",
    "we evaluate the first quantum correction along the lines of ref .  .",
    "below we briefly outline the approach .",
    "the expectation value of an observable @xmath100 to leading order beyond twa is  @xcite @xmath101 o_{w}({\\bf x } , { \\bf p},t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the initial wigner distribution , and @xmath103 . in the qsg model , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . in ref .",
    "the author implemented this correction by allowing a stochastic quantum jump in the momentum variable during the time evolution .",
    "this is done as follows : for each monte carlo step , we choose a set of initial conditions , weighted by the initial wigner distribution , in accordance with twa . for each set of initial conditions",

    "the quantum correction is found to enhance the current .",
    "this is expected on the grounds that twa underestimates the quantum fluctuations , and therefore underestimates the extent of gapless behavior in the dynamics .",
    "the main result of twa was that a current carrying state can persist even in the gapped phase of a model . in this section",

    "using the above it is straightforward to work out the current at long times after the quench .",
