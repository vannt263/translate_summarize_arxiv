    "as described in the paper , we consider a general probability distribution obtained by @xmath0 parties , having @xmath1 measurements with @xmath2 outcomes each .",
    "let @xmath137 denote one local measurement outcome , @xmath138 one setting and @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) denote the @xmath0-element strings of outcomes ( measurements ) for all parties .",
    "we define a probability distribution @xmath8 to be quantum and thus lying in @xmath4 , if there exists a hilbert space @xmath13 together with a state @xmath12 and positive operator valued measures @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , such that @xmath144 = 0 $ ] for every @xmath145 , and it holds that @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "the goal is to show that for any such @xmath8 one can find a quantum representation in standard form , that is , a representation which consists of projective measurements and a pure cyclic state for @xmath22 . the proof is given by an explicit construction .",
    "first , we recapitulate the definition of @xmath22 and what it means that a vector is cyclic for @xmath22 . the algebra generated by the operators @xmath148 , @xmath22 ,",
    "is defined as the closure of the set of all linear combinations of products of @xmath148 , i.e. @xmath149 with respect to taking expectation values ( i.e. , the weak * closure ) .",
    "this means that we add every @xmath150 for which a sequence @xmath151 in @xmath152 exists , such that @xmath153 for every state @xmath12 in @xmath13 . in mathematical terminology",
    "this is called a von neumann algebra @xcite .",
    "we call now a pure state @xmath154 cyclic for @xmath22 , if the closure of @xmath155 is the entire hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "we begin by turning the measurement operators @xmath18 into projective ones , by applying a version of the naimark dilation successively to each observable @xmath156 .",
    "it suffices to do this for one of the observables , provided we verify that in this construction not only the required commutativity conditions are preserved , but also the projection valuedness of any of the other measurements .",
    "so in order to turn the observable @xmath156 in to a projective measurement , we define the hilbert space @xmath157 , where each of the @xmath158 is a copy of the given hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "we denote by @xmath159 the projection onto the summand with label @xmath160 , and introduce the isometry @xmath161 then we will set @xmath162 , so that @xmath163 . for other observables at the same site ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath164 with @xmath165 , we set @xmath166 because @xmath167 is an isometry , we again have @xmath168 for all @xmath160 .",
    "with @xmath169 we denote the adjoint operator of @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , @xmath170 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , so that a projective measurement remains projective .",
    "for observables at all other sites @xmath173 we take @xmath174 , i.e. , as the original observable acting the same on each of the summands . once again",
    ", this preserves projective valuedness , and not only satisfies @xmath175 , but even the stronger relation @xmath176 . with this relation",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath177 for different @xmath178 ( possibly @xmath179 ) commute , so we can form the product @xmath180 unambiguously , and that @xmath181 .",
    "hence if we define the state @xmath182 , we obtain a quantum representation of the same point @xmath25 , with @xmath183 projective measurements .    in order to turn @xmath12 into a pure and cyclic state",
    "we can do the gelfand - naimark - segal ( gns ) construction ( theorem 2.3.16 in @xcite ) of the algbra @xmath22 with respect to the state @xmath12 .",
    "we consider @xmath22 together with the positive semidefinite sesquilinear form defined by @xmath184 as a pre - hilbert space . to get a hilbert space",
    "we first take the quotient with respect to the left ideal @xmath185 and then the completion with respect to the scalar product @xmath186 .",
    "we denote the obtained hilbert space by @xmath187 and its elements ( in the densely defined subspace ) are given by the equivalence classes @xmath188 for @xmath189 .",
    "we define the representation @xmath190 of @xmath22 on @xmath187 by the equation @xmath191 for @xmath192 .",
    "this representation is a * -homomorphism , that is , it respects products and the adjoint operation .",
    "hence , the operators @xmath193 satisfy the same commutation relation as @xmath18 and furthermore , projections are mapped onto projections .",
    "if we set @xmath194 , we have that @xmath195 .",
    "we therefore found a quantum representation of @xmath8 given by @xmath196 and a pure state @xmath21 which is by definition cyclic .",
    "the goal is to check extremality for a given @xmath8 in the ( 2,2,2)-case . we use the same notation as introduced in the example 2 in the paper .",
    "since we are only interested in extremal @xmath8 in @xmath4 , we can restrict to the ones which belong to an irreducible quantum representation ( see example 1 in the paper ) .",
    "they are described in a hilbert space @xmath197 and parameterized by a state @xmath68 and angles @xmath198 $ ] , which specify the @xmath199-valued observables @xmath92 and @xmath93 on alices and bobs side .",
    "the concrete form of the observables are given by @xmath200 and @xmath201 with @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204    because the observables are all real , an extremal @xmath8 always allows a representation with a real @xmath77 . to see this , we can write @xmath205 with @xmath206 real vectors in @xmath13 .",
    "note that if @xmath207 generates @xmath8 so does @xmath208 , with @xmath209 the complex conjugate of @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the state @xmath210 together with @xmath211 generates the same @xmath8 .",
    "but if @xmath8 is extremal then also @xmath212 and @xmath213 generates @xmath8 , thus , the state can be chosen to be real .",
    "moreover , the case @xmath214 corresponds to the case where the observables at alices or bobs side commute , which corresponds to @xmath8 which can be generated by a lhv model .",
    "hence , we restrict our attention to representations with a real @xmath77 and @xmath215 .          the restricted form of @xmath227 limits the possible irreducible representation for which the method applies , which means that it is not always possible to find coefficients @xmath228 such that condition ( i ) and ( ii ) are satisfied . the goal is to determine for",
    "which representations this can be done and derive the corresponding tsirelson inequality .",
    "we start by analyzing condition ( i ) . using the particular form of the observables @xmath102 and @xmath103 expressed through @xmath229 , we find that @xmath230 , @xmath222 , results in @xmath231 \\psi = \\sum_j \\eta_{ij}[\\idty\\otimes x_j ] \\psi   \\;\\ ; ( i=1,2)\\ ] ] where @xmath232 .",
    "we assumed here that @xmath218 is invertible .",
    "however , this is not a restriction since otherwise the state @xmath77 is of product form .    in the following it",
    "is convenient to use the isomorphism between @xmath13 and the hilbert space @xmath220 with the hilbert - schmidt inner product .",
    "states @xmath233 in @xmath13 are identified with matrices @xmath234 and @xmath235\\phi$ ] ( resp .",
    "@xmath236 \\phi$ ] ) can be written as @xmath237 ( resp .",
    "@xmath238 ) .",
    "moreover , we have that @xmath239 is a purification of the density matrix @xmath240 on @xmath241 . equation ( [ cond1 ] ) is then equivalent to @xmath242    the following assertion characterizes condition ( i ) : _ @xmath77 admits an @xmath243 such that ( [ cond1 ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath244 .",
    "then , it holds that @xmath245 _ the proof goes as follows .",
    "first , we note that @xmath246 must be invertible .",
    "this is due to the fact that otherwise the reduced state of @xmath77 given by @xmath247 has determinant @xmath106 and is therefore a pure state .",
    "we then multiply equation ( [ cond1x ] ) with @xmath248 from the left to find @xmath249 .",
    "recalling that @xmath250 , we can take the trace and obtain ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the first part of the statement .",
    "multiplication from the right of ( [ cond1x ] ) with @xmath251 shows that @xmath252 .",
    "thus , we obtain that @xmath253 from which follows that @xmath254 . on",
    "the other hand one can check that the set @xmath255 of all @xmath246 for which there exists a @xmath243 such that ( [ cond1 ] ) holds and @xmath256 , describes a group together with the usual matrix multiplication .",
    "moreover , the map @xmath257 induced by ( [ eta ] ) is a group homomorphism such that @xmath258 . from this",
    "we can then conclude that @xmath259 is the necessary and sufficient condition to solve ( [ cond1 ] ) .    because condition ( i ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath260 is an orthogonal matrix , the possible states @xmath77 are parameterized by @xmath261 where @xmath112 .",
    "the state @xmath77 determines the corresponding @xmath243 uniquely through equation ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "since the reduced state of @xmath77 is equal to @xmath262 , it follows directly that @xmath263 is maximally entangled . from this follows also that the expectation values of all local observables @xmath264 and @xmath116 vanish .",
    "the plot shows the ratio @xmath130 between the maximal quantum and classical violation of the tsirelson inequality ( [ tsirelsoninequ ] ) corresponding to @xmath265 for @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "the domain is restricted due to condition ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "the quotient @xmath130 exhibits a @xmath268-periodic behavior in @xmath160 and the peak of @xmath269 at @xmath270 and @xmath271 corresponds to a chsh inequality.,width=264 ]    we turn now to condition ( ii ) and compute the expectation value of @xmath105 with respect to @xmath272 , @xmath273 thus , condition ( ii ) requires that the matrices @xmath274 and @xmath275 are diagonal . in this case",
    "the tsirelson inequality reads @xmath276 the coefficients @xmath121 in condition ( ii ) are therefore @xmath277 for @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and the others @xmath106 .",
    "since the expectation value of @xmath105 is invariant under scaling and simultaneous unitary transformation of @xmath218 and @xmath219 , we can without loss of generality assume that @xmath280 with @xmath281 .",
    "this can always be achieved by the polar decomposition .",
    "using now that @xmath232 we can write @xmath282 with @xmath283 . the condition that @xmath275 is diagonal is then equivalent to @xmath284 which completely characterizes condition ( ii ) .",
    "let us now summarize the results from the discussions of the two conditions . condition ( i ) says that the only states @xmath77 for which the method applies are of the form ( [ eq , parstates ] ) .",
    "hence , we can constrain to representations @xmath285 with @xmath286 . for these states",
    "we can compute @xmath243 via equation ( [ eta ] ) , and insert it into @xmath283 to find that @xmath287 condition ( [ cond2 ] ) can then be computed to be @xmath288    provided that the inequality is satisfied , the method applies and we can compute @xmath289 and @xmath282 from which the tsirelson inequality ( [ tsirelsoninequ ] ) can be determined . expressed in @xmath290 , one finds that @xmath291 and @xmath292    among the possible @xmath8 for which the method applies are the probability distributions which lead to maximal violation of a chsh inequality .",
    "the corresponding representations are given by @xmath293 and @xmath294 with @xmath295 @xmath296 .",

    "<S> we investigate a fundamental property of device independent security in quantum cryptography by characterizing probability distributions which are necessarily independent of the measurement results of any eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> we show that probability distributions that are secure in this sense are exactly the extremal quantum probability distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to give a characterization of security in algebraic terms . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the method to common examples for two - party as well as multi - party setups and present a scheme for verifying security of probability distributions with two parties , two measurement settings , and two outcomes .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of using quantum systems for secure communication has been around for more than 25 years now . </S>",
    "<S> but still the boundaries of quantum cryptography have not been fully understood . only recently </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable feature of quantum systems has been realized , namely that observed violations of a bell inequality may imply cryptographic security , even if the measurements that lead to the violation are unknown to legitimate parties . </S>",
    "<S> this principle goes under the name `` device independent security '' and has been proven against collective attacks @xcite , and recently against arbitrary attacks for memoryless measurement devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but still no proof for the most general situation is known . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the question , when measurement outcomes obtained by the legitimate parties are independent of measurements performed by an eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> we give a necessary and sufficient condition for this under the assumption that the probability distributions are known without error .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a quantum correlation experiment with @xmath0 separated parties , each performing one of @xmath1 different local measurements with @xmath2 outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> we denote this situation by the triple @xmath3 . in a device </S>",
    "<S> independent scenario the parties ( usually @xmath0=2 ) want to extract a secret key from the observed correlations in which the security estimation is solely based on the measured probability distributions . </S>",
    "<S> there are no assumption on the proper functioning of the measurement devices or the measured system , e.g. , on their dimension . </S>",
    "<S> probability distributions that are useful for cryptography have to feature certain properties . </S>",
    "<S> first , the obtained correlations should not permit a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model as in this case a potential adversary can have full knowledge about the correlations . </S>",
    "<S> second , the correlations should only be weakly correlated to any possible measurement of an adversary . </S>",
    "<S> the first property is well known to be equivalent to violate a bell inequality ( see below ) , but the latter still lacks a concrete characterization .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address this problem by specifying all probability distributions which do not allow a lhv model and are provably statistically independent of the knowledge of any eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these probability distributions , which we call secure , can completely be characterized in geometric terms . indeed in the convex body @xmath4 of all quantum probability distributions </S>",
    "<S> the secure points are precisely the non - classical extremal points , i.e. , those which are not deterministic and can not be obtained as proper convex combination of other points in @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of extremal points in @xmath4 is of general interest and numerical approaches to determine them are known @xcite . in our examples , </S>",
    "<S> we provide and discuss different tools to certify , respectively , find extremal probability distributions for particular @xmath3-cases . in many situations </S>",
    "<S> it turns out to be easier to establish a stronger property , i.e. , that the algebraic structure of the measurement operators is completely determined by the probability distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this also leads to a stronger notion of security . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent example ( see example 3 ) are correlations which maximally violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh)-inequality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results have links to previous results obtained in the framework of non - signaling correlations , i.e. , theories that are more general than quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> one direction of our result , namely that extremality implies security was proven in @xcite for non - signalling theories in the bipartite case . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> these numbers are assumed to be known exactly , i.e. , we do not consider the uncertainties involved in estimating such probabilities from a finite sample .    the set of probability distributions @xmath8 conform to a lhv model , i.e. , which can be realized by assuming the measurements reveal outcomes whose probabilities are predetermined , is called the set @xmath9 of classical correlations . </S>",
