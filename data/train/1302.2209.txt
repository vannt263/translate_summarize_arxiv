    "blazars are a prominent class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . based on their optical properties",
    ", they are traditionally divided into bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) .",
    "bl lacs have no strong emission features in their optical spectra , while fsrqs show strong , broad emission lines .",
    "blazars are all compact radio sources with flat radio spectra ( with spectral index @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 , defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the flux density and @xmath8 the frequency ) , rapid variability , high polarization , and radio structure dominated by a compact `` core '' . according to the unified picture of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of their antiparallel jets points close to the observer s direction .",
    "the jets are nearly perpendicular to the accretion disk which supplies the central supermassive ( up to @xmath1@xmath9  m@xmath10 ) black hole with fresh material .",
    "the radiation of the relativistic outflow in the approaching jet is beamed towards us , while the receding jet becomes too faint to be detected . with the high angular resolution provided by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , characteristic signatures of low - inclination relativistic jets , such as apparent superluminal motion and high brightness temperatures , even in excess of the inverse - compton limit ( @xmath1@xmath11  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be detected .    since",
    "their jets are oriented close to the line of sight , the emission of blazars is believed to be greatly enhanced by the effect of doppler boosting .",
    "the non - thermal emission of the jet dominates the entire spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , apart from the thermal contribution from the accretion disk , the broad - line region and the host galaxy , significant in the near - infrared , optical and ultraviolet bands ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the non - thermal emission shows two humps in the sed , one at lower frequencies ( synchrotron peak ) , and another one at higher energies , in the x - rays or @xmath12-rays . the high - energy emission is thought to be a result of inverse - compton scattering of the photons by interacting with the electrons accelerated in the jet .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission varies considerably within the blazar class , from below @xmath13  hz for low - synchrorton peaked ( lsp ) objects to above @xmath14  hz for high - synchrotron peaked ( hsp ) sources , with an intermediate subclass in between .",
    "the radio - loud agn sdss  j102623.61 + 254259.5 ( j1026 + 2542 hereafter ) has recently been claimed as the second most distant blazar by @xcite .",
    "its redshift is @xmath0=5.266 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 9 ( dr9 , * ? ? ?",
    "j1026 + 2542 is a prominent radio source , with several flux density measurements available in the literature between 151  mhz and 8.4  ghz frequencies .",
    "the catalogue compiled by @xcite gives @xmath3=@xmath15 for the fitted spectral index .",
    "the source is unresolved ( @xmath16 ) at 1.4  ghz in the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite , with @xmath17=239  mjy integrated flux density .",
    "its total ( single - dish ) flux density at 4.85  ghz is @xmath18=142  mjy in the gb6 catalogue @xcite . at this latter frequency",
    ", the source has been imaged with the us national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very long baseline array ( vlba ) , as part of the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips ) sample @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of potential high - redshift blazars selected from the sdss , and followed up their best candidate , j1026 + 2542 , at different wavebands to construct a sed from the radio up to the @xmath12-rays .",
    "the syncrotron peak is located above @xmath14  hz in the rest frame of the source .",
    "the blazar nature of the object is supported by its strong and hard x - ray emission and a comparison with the remarkably similar sed of the highest - redshift known blazar j0906 + 6930 at @xmath0=5.47 @xcite .",
    "they fitted a one - zone synchrotron and inverse - compton model , together with an accretion disk , a dusty torus and a hot thermal corona to the observed sed , and concluded that it is consistent with what is usually applied for other powerful blazars . in particular",
    ", they obtained @xmath19=14 for the bulk lorentz factor in the outflow . from the thermal near infrared and optical emission",
    ", they deduced that the mass of the central black hole is between 2 and 5 billion solar masses @xcite .",
    "the number of radio agn at very high redshifts ( @xmath0@xmath204.5 ) that are presently known and studied in some details , like j1026 + 2542 , barely exceeds 10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these rare objects are therefore valuable targets for observational astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "they provide important constraints on the growth of the earliest supermassive black holes and the onset of agn activity period in the radio .",
    "intriguingly , this small highest - redshift radio agn sample is dominated by objects different from the highly doppler - boosted , compact , flat - spectrum blazars .",
    "while there are several weaker ( mjy - level ) , compact steep - spectrum radio quasars known at @xmath0@xmath205.7 , the redshift of the most distant blazar , j0906 + 6930 @xcite , is only @xmath0=5.47 .",
    "this is in contrast with the expectation that the most luminous ( i.e. doppler - boosted ) sources are to be discovered first in a flux - limited sample at the highest redshifts .",
    "however , the very small sample we know at present is in fact not radio - selected and not flux - limited , but rather determined by the availability of optical spectroscopic data used to derive the redshift .",
    "it is therefore too early to conclude that blazars are `` missing '' at @xmath0@xmath216 .    in this paper , we re - analyse the vips data @xcite taken in 2006 , present an image of j1026 + 2542 and model its brightness distribution",
    "this allows us to estimate the brightness temperature and the inferred doppler - boosting factor for the inner radio jet .",

    "the observations of j1026 + 2542 were made on 2006 january 28 in 10 separate @xmath11-min scans with the ten 25-m antennas of the vlba .",
    "the details of the observing and the initial data calibration in the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips , * ? ? ?",

    "we downloaded the calibrated visibility data and made a total intensity image of the source .",

    "our aim was to characterise the brightness distribution of j1026 + 2542 with a set of simple gaussian model components .",
    "we used difmap for fitting a model directly to the self - calibrated visibility data .",

    "the major axis of this elliptical points to the jet direction .",
    "to quantitatively classify the morphology of their large sample of vips sources , @xcite used an automated gaussian model fitting procedure within aips , but in the image plane .",
    "we chose visibility - plane model fitting because it is thought to be more reliable @xcite . @xcite also found five model components to describe j1026 + 2542 , but listed only their mean radius ( 6.8  mas ) and maximum separation ( 20.8  mas ) .",
    "it is obvious from table  [ modelfit ] that our model components fitted directly to the visibility data are smaller .    to investigate the possibility that the central elliptical gaussian model component represents a barely resolved blend of a weaker , more compact `` core '' and more extended blob further along the jet , we fitted and alternative model in difmap .",
    "the elliptical gaussian component was replaced with a point source plus a circular gaussian component .",
    "as the model - fitting solutions are not unique @xcite , it is not surprising that the resulting 6-component model leads to a similarly good fit to the visibility data , and a restored image practically indistinguishable from the one in fig .",
    "[ vlbi - model ] . in this representation ,",
    "the first component in table  [ modelfit ] splits into a central point source with ( 15.1@xmath280.8 )  mjy flux density , and a circular gaussian component of ( 17.9@xmath281.0 )  mjy flux density and ( 0.52@xmath280.02 )  mas angular size . owing to the finite resolution of the vlbi array",
    ", there is a minimum resolvable angular size ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in this experiment , which gives an upper limit for the angular extent of the central point source , @xmath29=0.29  mas and @xmath30=0.18  mas .    in the discussion which follows in sect",
    ".  [ discussion ] , we apply both the 5-component model ( table  [ modelfit ] ) and the 6-component version , with the unresolved central source , to estimate the parameters of the radio jet . in any case , according to the vlbi image and model(s ) , the radio structure of j1026 + 2542 is clearly resolved at mas scale and has a prominent one - sided core  jet structure .",
    "the jet extends up to @xmath120  mas in the w - nw direction ( position angle about @xmath31 ) .",
    "the sum of the flux densities in the vlbi components ( 70  mjy ) is the half of the total gb6 flux density measured at the same frequency , although at a different epoch .",
    "therefore the effect of any flux density variablity , if present in the source , can not be excluded .      at lower resolution ,",
    "vla data of the quasar j1026 + 2542 are available from the nrao archive[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "the catalogue of the crates 8.4-ghz survey of flat - spectrum radio sources @xcite describes j1026 + 2542 as a point source with @xmath32=105.7  mjy but presents no image . we obtained archival data taken on 1991 june 19 with the vla in its most extended a configuration ( experiment code ap204 ) . as a part of a large sample , j1026 + 2542 was observed for a short scan of 1.5-min duration with a total bandwidth of 100  mhz . phases and amplitudes were calibrated in a standard way in aips , using the source 3c  286 as the absolute flux density calibrator .",
    "the data were then exported to difmap for imaging . the 8.4-ghz image ( fig .",
    "[ vla - image ] ) indeed shows a source practically unresolved , with no significant radio emission beyond @xmath33 above the brightness limit of @xmath10.6  mjy  beam@xmath23 ( 5@xmath34 ) , although from the slight asymmetry of the contours ( i.e. the shallower gradient of the brightness distribution ) , there is a hint on an extension towards the west",

    "[ vlbi - image ] ) .",
    "a circular gaussian model component fitted to the 8.4-ghz vla visibility data in difmap gives ( 104@xmath285 ) mjy flux density , similar to the value presented by @xcite .",
    "another archival vla a - array experiment ( project code tc001 , observing date 2002 june 19 , bandwidth 100  mhz , on - source time 2 min , angular resolution @xmath150  mas ) allowed us to measure the flux density of j1026 + 2542 at 43  ghz as well . with an analysis similar to that of the experiment ap204 above",
    ", we obtained @xmath35=(55@xmath284 )  mjy .",

    "[ radio - spectrum ] ) . due to the high redshift",
    ", these frequencies correspond to @xmath11  ghz and 270  ghz , respectively , in the rest frame of the source .",
    "the fitted gaussian model parameters of the vlbi `` core '' allow us to determine the brightness temperature of the source , in the units of k : @xmath36 where @xmath7 is the flux density ( jy ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the major and minor axes of the fitted gaussian model component ( fwhm , mas ) .",
    "the observing frequency , @xmath8 , is expressed in ghz .",
    "the parameters of our resolved elliptical gaussian `` core '' component ( the first line in table  [ modelfit ] ) lead to @xmath39=@xmath40  k. on the other hand , if we use our point - source model from the 6-component modelfit , we obtain @xmath41  k. this latter value is a lower limit to the brightness temperature due to the finite resolution of the radio interferometer .",
    "let us first investigate the case of the resolved vlbi `` core '' , resulting from our first model fitting ( table  [ modelfit ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic brightness temperature ( @xmath42 ) of the source is close to the equipartition value , @xmath43  k @xcite , we can derive the doppler factor @xmath44 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "we note that @xcite derived @xmath19=14 for j1026 + 2542 form their sed modelling .",
    "however , following the model of @xcite , they assumed that the jet viewing angle is @xmath51@xmath1@xmath53 , therefore their proposed small viewing angle and the estimated lorentz factor are not independent quantities .",
    "the doppler factor is related to the bulk lorentz factor and the bulk speed of the jet material ( @xmath54@xmath461 , expressed in the unit of the speed of light ) as follows : @xmath55 the lorentz factor is @xmath56 consequently , @xmath57    for @xmath45=0.34 and @xmath19=15 , we obtain @xmath51@xmath52@xmath58 .",
    "the jet inclination angle corresponding to @xmath45=1 is @xmath51@xmath52@xmath59 . as it is apparent from fig .",

    "vlbi imaging observations at multiple epochs are potentially useful to measure the apparent proper motion of the components in agn radio jets .",
    "once the doppler - boosting factor and the apparent transverse speeed @xmath62 are measured , both @xmath19 and @xmath51 can be determined from the radio interferometric data alone . the blazar j1026 +",
    "2542 is unique in the distant universe at @xmath0@xmath205 with its prominent mas - scale jet structure ( fig .",
    "[ vlbi - image ] ) , for which the proper motions with respect to the existing first - epoch data @xcite could be measured now . based on the suspected lorentz factor and viewing angle , the expected displacement over a @xmath17-yr interval exceeds 1  mas , reliably detectable with a second - epoch 5-ghz vlbi imaging observation .",
    "the source therefore offers the first - time possibility to directly measure agn radio jet parameters at @xmath0@xmath205 , to compare them with known samples of lower - redshift agn , and to supplement the data available for a classical cosmological test , the apparent proper motion  redshift relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with measurements at the extreme tail of the redshift distribution .",
    "it is possible , however , that in the calculations above , we underestimate the brightness tempearture of the vlbi `` core '' because its emission is blended with a recently ejected , more extended jet component .",
    "follow - up vlbi imaging observations , possibly revealing a moving inner jet component , would be essential to decide if it was indeed the case in 2006 . to investigate the consequences of a higher brightness temperature",
    ", we can apply the lower limit , @xmath41  k , implied by the parameters of the central unresolved source in our 6-component model fit .",
    "the comparison with the equipartition brightness temperature leads to a doppler factor of at least 2 , and a jet viewing angle smaller than about @xmath61 ( eq .  [ angle ] ) .",
    "an alternative way to estimate the doppler factor is to assume that the observed x - ray emission is of inverse - compton origin . then the measured x - ray flux and the radio properties ( optically thin spectral index , core flux density and diameter ) of the source give the doppler factor , @xmath63 @xcite . taking the _ swift _ x - ray data from @xcite and the radio parameters obtained in this paper into account , and using the assumptions by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath64 for j1026 + 2542 . for this calculation",
    ", we considered the resolved elliptical gaussian component for the core ( table  [ modelfit ] ) .",

    ", @xcite also found that @xmath63@xmath52@xmath66 , typically within a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "although the @xmath63 estimate is that uncertain , the initial assumptions ( in particular that the vlbi observations are taken at the turnover frequency ) do not necessarily hold , and the value we obtained is rather a lower limit to the doppler factor if there is some additional source of the x - ray flux in the object , this also suggests that the doppler factor for j1026 + 2542 is likely below unity .",
    "applying the upper angular size limit from our alternative point - source model , the calculation gives @xmath67 .",
    "( the doppler factor obtained this way would increase by a factor of @xmath13 if the size is halved with respect to the upper limit we could derive from the vlbi data . )",
    "by analysing archival vlbi imaging data , we estimated the brightness tempearture of the high - redshift flat - spectrum radio quasar j1026 + 2542 ( @xmath0=5.266 ) and concluded that its emission is not necessarily strongly doppler - boosted .",
    "somewhat contrary to the common notion , blazar jets do not always point _ very _ close ( @xmath51@xmath11@xmath2 ) to the line of sight . in the case of the j1026 + 2542 jet ,",
    "we have shown that @xmath51 may exceed @xmath12040@xmath2 , if we accept a typical value of 15 for the bulk lorentz factor , and a resolved vlbi `` core '' component .",
    "even an extremely high value of the lorentz factor ( e.g @xmath19=30 ) does not change qualitatively our conclusion about the jet inclination .",
    "if a similarly viable point - source model is used instead , the brightness temperature , and thus the doppler factor becomes higher , and the viewing angle can be below @xmath61 .    as the only agn with a prominent mas- to 10-mas - scale radio jet structure at @xmath0@xmath205 known to date , j1026",
