    "it was shown by gauntlett et al @xcite that low energy string theory admits supersymmetric solutions of the gdel type @xcite .",
    "these homogeneous spaces have closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) and closed null curves ( cncs ) which are homotopic to a point .",
    "it was then pointed out that these closed causal curves ( cccs ) are not present in certain dimensional upliftings and certain t - dual versions of the gdel spaces @xcite . the reason was understood in @xcite : the uplifted or t - dual spacetime is a standard pp - wave , of the type that has been recently studied as the penrose limit of certain near horizon brane geometries @xcite .",
    "such realization raised the hope that string theory could shed light on one of the most important open problems in general relativity , or more generally , in gravitational theories : are geometries with cccs intrinsically inconsistent ? or is propagation of matter in geometries with cccs intrinsically inconsistent ?",
    "the reason for this optimistic expectation concerning string theory and this problem is two - folded .",
    "on the one hand there are the hints left by the incomplete attempts to tackle this problem at the classical and semi - classical level .",
    "classically there is a great number of solutions which obey all important energy conditions and have cccs which are homotopic to a point .",
    "lorentzian taub - nut is a striking example , since it is a completely non - singular vacuum solution .",
    "thus such solutions can not be ruled out by requirements on the matter content .",
    "can we at least rule out classically _ creating _ such solutions ?",
    "tipler claimed to have answered affirmatively to this question @xcite .",
    "however , he assumes the weak energy condition which might be violated in quantum processes .",
    "this led to several suggestions of ` time machines ' sourced by quantum effects , most notoriously the morris - thorne wormholes @xcite and to the proposal by hawking that the spacetime ` chronology protection ' relies on quantum rather than classical effects @xcite .",
    "several works tried to establish that studying quantum field theory in spacetimes with cccs leads to inconsistencies , most importantly the violation of unitarity verified through the breakdown of the optical theorem .",
    "examples include @xcite .",
    "all these attempts are semi - classical .    on the other hand string theory",
    "is quantum gravity and we can quantize strings in the pp - waves dual to the gdel universe . thus , these supersymmetric gdel solutions provide an ideal lab to test possible inconsistencies of quantum gravity in the presence of cccs .",
    "this is the topic of this paper .",
    "recent discussions of ctc s in string theory can be found in @xcite .",
    "an immediate observation concerns the choice of coordinates for the pp - wave .",
    "one can choose coordinates for which the pp - wave takes the canonical form , and the only non - trivial coefficient is @xmath0 . then string quantization is equivalent to that of a set of massive scalar fields @xcite",
    "however , since quantization is in general performed in the light cone gauge , it is difficult to impose in these coordinates the identification that creates the non - trivial causal structure and gives the spacetime u - dual to gdel . by changing coordinates ,",
    "string quantization becomes a landau type problem @xcite ( see some other related work @xcite ) .",
    "then , the necessary identifications can be easily implemented .",
    "the price to pay is that the definition of quantum operators becomes dependent on the light cone momentum and the hilbert space is naturally divided in a set of subspaces related by spectral flow @xcite , which introduces some subtleties in the interpretation of some states and in the calculation of the partition function .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the results herein along the lines of some of the aforementioned semi - classical computations and other results in string theory : we discuss a possible signal of ghost states and thus unitarity violation .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , this example parallels the case of some supersymmetric rotating black holes .",
    "the bmpv black hole @xcite has a cft description in terms of the d1-d5 system . on the spacetime side",
    "there is a bound between angular momentum and mass ; when the former exceeds the latter the event horizon disappears and the spacetime has ctcs through every point . on the cft side , the states that one could associate to this over - rotating case are ghosts @xcite .",
    "note the contrast with the dynamical violations of unitarity mentioned above for qft in curved spacetimes with ctcs .",
    "violating the unitarity at the level of the spectrum is more fundamental .",
    "it means that these spacetimes with closed timelike curves , albeit bps states of supergravity , should not be states of string theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly review the basics of the compactified pp - wave and gdel type solutions in string theory .",
    "we then summarize the classical string solutions and their correspondence to quantum string states in section 3 .",
    "the classical string solutions will be discussed in detail in section 4 , first by using the nambu - goto string and then by the polyakov string .",
    "section 5 is devoted to quantum strings , where we discuss the correspondence between classical and quantum states in detail , and then analyze the partition function carefully . in section 6 we discuss some of our results ; in particular we elaborate on the possible imprint of cccs in the partition function . in appendix",
