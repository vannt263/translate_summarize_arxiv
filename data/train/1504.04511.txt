    "the invariance of the spectrum under discrete scale transformations with the preferred scaling factor squared @xmath5 can be understood as the consequence of a three - body interaction @xmath6 governed by a renormalization group ( rg ) limit cycle @xcite .",

    "more generally , the limit cycle will be manifest in observables through their log - periodic dependence on the scattering length or other control parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "the period of this log - periodic behavior is again determined by the discrete scaling factor which is the key quantity determining the properties of the limit cycle .",

    "such heteronuclear efimov states have recently been observed in experiment and the prediction of the scaling factor was confirmed @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the efimov effect also provides a universal binding mechanism for s - wave states in weakly - bound nuclei . however , an observation of the discrete scaling relation between different states in one nucleus has proven elusive to date since the known s - wave halo nuclei have no excited states .",

    "the emphasis of this work is on formulating criteria for detecting a limit cycle in the evolved interaction . in particular",

    "a long term goal of our work is the derivation of the limit cycle in the pionless eft for the nuclear three - body system .",
    "while it is generally assumed that the pionless eft in which the efimov effect and corresponding limit cycle are manifest appears as the low - energy limit of a more fundamental chiral eft with explicit pions , no explicit derivation has ever been given .",

    "one can recognize a major characteristic of the srg with the @xmath23 generator .",
