    "recently a new global next - to - leading order ( nlo ) analysis @xcite of spin - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) was performed by the jam ( jefferson lab angular momentum ) collaboration @xcite , in which particular attention was paid to the valence quark - dominated region at high parton momentum fractions @xmath0 and low four - momentum transfers @xmath2 .",
    "this region requires careful treatment of the potentially important @xmath3 power corrections associated with target mass and higher twist contributions to the inelastic cross sections , as well as nuclear smearing effects when using deuterium and @xmath4he data .",
    "the analysis @xcite indeed found significant effects on the polarized leading twist pdfs when twist-3 and twist-4 power corrections in both the spin - dependent @xmath5 and @xmath6 structure functions were taken into account .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7 distribution ( defined as @xmath8 ) was found to have a significantly larger magnitude at @xmath9 than in previous global analyses , driven partly by a large and positive twist-4 correction to the neutron @xmath5 structure function .",
    "analyses such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite that systematically incorporate subleading effects in an effort to accommodate data over a broad range of kinematics can therefore provide a more solid basis for extracting reliable information on pdfs and their uncertainties , especially in regions such as at large @xmath0 where data are relatively scarce @xcite .",
    "in fact , the absence of high - precision polarization data at high @xmath0 , particularly for the neutron ( or @xmath4he ) , has meant that spin - dependent pdfs are essentially unconstrained for @xmath10 .",
    "this is rather unfortunate , given that polarized pdfs , and ratios of polarized to unpolarized pdfs , are quite sensitive to the details of nonperturbative quark - gluon dynamics in the nucleon at high @xmath0 , with theoretical predictions differing in some cases even in sign @xcite .",
    "in the simplest quark models , for example , spin - flavor symmetry implies constant ratios of pdfs , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "symmetry breaking effects , which typically generate a larger energy for axial vector spectator diquark configurations compared to scalar diquarks , generally raise the @xmath14 ratio to unity in the @xmath1 limit , while keeping @xmath15 unchanged from the su(6 ) value @xcite .",
    "calculations of one - gluon exchange in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , on the other hand , predict that @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spin - averaged distribution , for all quark flavors @xmath18 .",

    "this found that a reasonably good fit to the available data was indeed possible , with the feature of a steep rise in the @xmath15 ratio at intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "later high - precision data from the e99 - 117 experimental at jefferson lab @xcite observed the first evidence of a turn over in the @xmath19 neutron polarization asymmetry from negative to positive values , although at somewhat larger values of @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) than those in the fit of ref .",

    "an exception is the kinematic region at large @xmath0 , where hard gluon exchange between the quarks in the leading three - quark fock state component of the nucleon can be used to determine the dominant contributions to the @xmath0 dependence of the pdfs in the @xmath1 limit @xcite .",
    "typically one finds that the quark pdfs in the nucleon behave as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the minimum number of partons that are spectators to the hard collision @xcite , so that for @xmath47 the leading exponent is equal to 3 .",
    "more generally , the exponent on @xmath48 also depends logarithmically on @xmath2 @xcite , although the scale from which this should evolve is _ a priori _ unknown .",

    "of course , the additional polynomial terms in ( [ eq : jam ] ) with coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 obscure the direct connection between the @xmath0 dependence of the fitted distributions and the predicted pqcd behavior . to make the connection more explicit , we consider a fit based on a simplified functional form , with parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq .",

    "the @xmath58 polarization asymmetries in dis are therefore expected to approach unity for both the proton and neutron .",
    "unfortunately , current data can not definitively confirm the pqcd expectations . while the proton @xmath59 asymmetries , which have been measured to @xmath60 in the dis region , are consistent with an approach towards unity in the @xmath1 limit , the neutron ( or @xmath4he ) data extend only to @xmath61 and are generally consistent with a zero or negative asymmetry .",
    "the dearth of high-@xmath0 data means that the spin - dependent pdfs , and particularly the @xmath7 distributions , are essentially unconstrained above this region . consequently the spin - dependent pdfs obtained from global analyses often violate the positivity condition @xmath62 at large @xmath0 (",

    "this is significantly higher than the turn - over found in the earlier lss analysis @xcite at @xmath68 , which was subsequently found to be in conflict with the neutron asymmetry data from the e99 - 117 experiment at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "indeed , the existing data tend to disfavor fits with positive @xmath69 quark polarization over the measured @xmath0 range .",
