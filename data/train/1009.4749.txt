    "in 2008 the cdf collaboration published an analysis of events containing at least two muons , and found a large excess of so  called ghost events , which supposedly can not be explained by the known qcd production with the current understanding of the cdf detector @xcite .",
    "the two muons with the highest transverse momenta in a sample event , the so - called initial muons , each were required to have transverse momentum @xmath5{gev}$ ] , a pseudorapidity @xmath6 and a combined invariant mass in the range @xmath7{gev } < m_{\\mu\\mu } \\leq \\unit[80]{gev}$ ] . in the following these cuts are called two  muon cuts .    in defining these muon tracks ,",
    "no information from the silicon microvertex detector ( svx ) is used . according to cdf ,",
    "some of muon pairs passing the above cuts should have been detected by the svx if they come from known sources .",
    "these are called qcd background events by cdf , and chiefly originate from drell  yan pairs , semileptonic decays of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks , and misidentified charged hadrons .",
    "however , only in about of the observed di  muon events both muons were also detected by the svx .",
    "cdf therefore concludes that there is a large number of ghost events where at least one initial muon is produced outside of the beam pipe ( more exactly , outside the first layer of the svx , which is adjacent to the beam pipe ) with a radius of @xmath10{mm}$ ] .",
    "indeed , many of the primary muons were found to have a large impact parameter .",
    "moreover , nearly of these events contained one or several additional muons with @xmath11{gev}$ ] and @xmath12 , many of which again have a high impact parameter ; this fraction is about four times higher than one expects for qcd events .",
    "furthermore , the ghost sample contains approximately equally many same  sign ( ss ) and opposite  sign ( os ) initial muon pairs .    after correcting for events from ordinary sources , i.e. qcd production",
    ", cdf finds @xmath13 ghost events within a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath14{pb^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "the ghost cross section @xmath15{pb } \\approx \\unit[(114.4 \\pm 6.5)]{pb}\\ ] ] is comparable in size to the @xmath16 contribution to the di  muon sample : @xmath17{pb } \\approx \\unit[(298.6 \\pm 15.7)]{pb}.\\ ] ] considering this high cross section and the remarkable properties of the ghost events it is natural to ask whether such events could ( and hence presumably should ) have been observed in earlier experiments .",
    "this question can be answered only in the framework of concrete particle physics models . in the following section",
    "we therefore first describe properties of the ghost particles ( whose decays produce the detected muons ) that can be derived almost model  independently from the cdf data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm_results ] we describe a simple model that reproduces most of the features of most ghost events @xcite .",
    "this model indeed predicts that experiments at lower energies should have observed dozens to thousands of ghost events .",
    "we then construct a somewhat more complicated model , which improves the description of the subset of ghost events containing at least three muons ; this model is much more difficult to probe at fixed ",
    "target experiments . finally , we conclude .",
    "as described above , muons in ghost events seem to originate at a large distance from the primary interaction vertex .",
    "this indicates that the muons are produced in the decays of rather long  lived @xmath0 particles .",
    "many properties of the @xmath0 particle follow from the properties of the ghost events .",
    "first , the @xmath0 particles should be electrically neutral .",
    "otherwise they would have escaped detection by lep experiments only if their mass exceeded , which would have put their cross section closer to that for @xmath18 production than that for @xmath19 production . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath0 particles themselves would then have produced a track which in many cases should have been easier to detect by the svx than a muon track , since such heavy @xmath0 particles would often have had smaller velocity , and hence larger energy loss @xmath20 , than ultra  relativistic muons .",
    "the @xmath0 particles should have an average decay length @xmath21{mm}$ ] , in order to account for the high impact parameters of the ghost muons and in particular for the fact that at least one initial muon appears to be created outside of the beam pipe . on the other hand",
    ", the decay length can not be very much larger than 15 mm , since both muons originate well within the cdf tracker .",
    "the fact that approximately equally many ss and os ghost di  muon events are observed indicates that the @xmath0 particle should be a majorana particle , i.e. identical to its cp conjugate .",
    "finally , the fact that a significant fraction of ghost di  muon events contains additional `` secondary '' muon indicates that all @xmath0 particles decay into a final state with relatively high multiplicity . otherwise the branching ratio into multiple muons",
    "would be expected to be very small . on the other hand , the higher the decay multiplicity , the more complicated a full ( renormalizable ) quantum field theory reproducing our phenomenological model would have to be . in our simulations",
    "we therefore assume that all @xmath0 particles decay into four elementary fermions , at least one of which is a muon .",
    "we model these decays using pure phase space , i.e. assuming constant decay matrix elements .",
    "in order to proceed further , we have to make assumptions regarding the production mechanism of @xmath0 pairs . in our simple model",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 particles are pair  produced directly in either gluon  gluon fusion or quark  antiquark annihilation , with differential @xmath22wave cross section @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the squared partonic center of mass energy , @xmath25 is the mass of the @xmath0 particle , @xmath26 is the velocity of the @xmath0 particles in the partonic center of mass frame , and @xmath27 are constants which are fixed by the requirement that we reproduce the ghost cross section measured by cdf .",
    "we want to use the simple model to estimate the number of ghost di  muon events that should have been detected by earlier experiments operating at lower center of mass energies . using the fact that about half of these events contain like  sign muons , as well as the large impact parameters of these muons , should suppress physics backgrounds to negligible levels .",
    "possible instrumental backgrounds can only be evaluated by the experiments themselves .",
    "the free parameters of this simple model are the decay modes and corresponding branching ratios of the @xmath0 particle , its mass and lifetime .",
    "we set the lifetime as @xmath28{mm}\\,;\\ ] ] this choice only affects the impact parameter distribution of the ghost muons , but no other results .",
    "we include the following decay modes :    * 1muon : @xmath29  or @xmath30 * 2muon : @xmath31  or  @xmath32 * 4muon : @xmath33    our assumption the @xmath0 is a majorana particle implies that charge conjugate modes contribute with equal branching ratio .",
    "these decays conserve electric charge and all lepton numbers .",
    "spin conservation then implies that @xmath0 is a boson .    in order to simulate @xmath34 events",
    ", we implemented the production cross sections ( [ e1 ] ) into herwig++ @xcite , using default parameters for parton showering and the underlying event .",
    "recall that we model @xmath0 decays assuming constant decay matrix elements .",
    "fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the di  muon excess occurs at rather small invariant mass of the primary muon pair , @xmath35 $ \\sim$}}~}\\unit[40]{gev}$ ] .",
    "together with the large cross section for ghost events this argues for a relatively light @xmath0 particle .",
    "unfortunately no @xmath36 spectrum of the primary muons in ghost events is provided , which might have allowed to estimate @xmath25 from the bulk of events that do not contain additional muons .",
    "we therefore use the invariant mass distribution of all muons contained in the 27,990 @xmath37 cones ( corresponding to @xmath38 ) around initial muons which contain at least one additional muon ( see fig .",
    "34a in @xcite).{pb^{-1}}$ ] ) than that used for the determination of the ghost cross section described in the introduction .",
    "the number of cones given here is consistent with our earlier statement that a little under of all ghost events contain at least one additional muon .",
    "] this distribution matches the invariant mass distribution in each cone for the events , in which both cones contain at least one additional muon ( fig .",
    "34b in @xcite ) .",
    "this agrees with our model , in which both @xmath0 particles contribute one initial muon each with identical cone properties . in most cases only additional muons from the decay of the same @xmath0 particle that produced the initial muon",
    "are contained in the @xmath37 cone around the initial muon .",
    "the reason is that in the partonic center of mass system the @xmath0 particles propagate in opposite directions .",
    "the measured invariant mass distribution of all muons in these cones is shown in the left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig34a ] ; it peaks around @xmath39{gev}$ ] , and becomes very small beyond @xmath40{gev}$ ] .",

    "coded muon multiplicity distribution of additional muons found in @xmath37 cones around the initial muons . here",
    "each additional muon with the _ same charge _ as the primary muon increases the count by ten , whereas each additional muon with the _ opposite charge _ as the primary muon counts as one . in case of @xmath0 pair production from quark ",
    "antiquark annihilation our fit for the branching ratios is for the 1muon , for the 2muon , and for the 4muon decay .",

    "[ fig : fig22b ] compares the original cdf result ( fig .",
    "22b in @xcite ) with our simulation .",
    "clearly our model produces fewer entries at high muon multiplicities .",
    "furthermore , the ratio between cones with one os additional muon , i.e. the number of entries in `` 1 '' , and with one ss additional muon , i.e. the number of entries in `` 10 '' , is too high .",
    "the higher number of entries in `` 1 '' follows from the construction of the decay modes .",
    "since all muons inside a cone usually result from the decay of the same @xmath0 particle , the 2muon decay only contributes to `` 1 '' and the 4muon decay gives two times more entries in `` 1 '' than in `` 10 '' . in order to reproduce this ratio correctly , we need a 2muon decay with ss muons .",
    "the conservation of electric charge , all single lepton numbers and spin then requires a decay into at least eight elementary fermions , e.g. @xmath45 .",
    "one would obviously need a very contrived model to reproduce this in a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "another possibility is to allow violation of separate lepton numbers , insisting only that the _ total _ lepton number remains conserved ; we will pursue this in our more complicated model .",
    "furthermore , our simple model almost never generates events with more than three additional muons in a @xmath37 cone around a primary muon .",
    "this discrepancy with the data may be considered less problematic , since it concerns only a small fraction of all ghost events .",
    "in addition these multi  muon events are presumably more prone to experimental errors .",
    "for example , an underestimated fake muon rate would affect the extracted rate of events with multiple muons more than that of events with fewer muons ; note that the fake muon contribution has been subtracted by cdf in the result reproduced in the left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig22b ] .",
    "we emphasize that we want to use our model only to estimate di  muon rates . while the multi ",
    "muon events are indeed spectacular , they have substantially reduced cross sections .",
    "recall also that there is very little physics background to di  muon events where the muons originate a few cm from the primary interaction vertex . or @xmath9 flavored hadrons ) , or typically have much longer decay lengths ( e.g. @xmath46{m}~[\\unit[3.7]{m}]$ ] for charged pions [ kaons ] , which needs to be multiplied with a large @xmath47 factor to produce sufficiently hard muons ) . ]    having fixed the parameters of the model , we are ready to make predictions for the number of expected ghost events in various experiments .",
    "we focus on experiments that had the possibility to identify muons , and accumulated large data samples .",
    "these include the experiment ua1 at the cern @xmath2 collider @xcite , and the fermilab fixed ",
    "target experiments e605 @xcite , e772 @xcite , e789 @xcite and e866 @xcite .",
    "e789 is especially interesting for our purposes since it featured a vertex detector , which should have had no trouble detecting the long flight path of @xmath0 particles if some of them had been produced .",
    "we also considered the hera experiments zeus and h1 , where @xmath0 pairs could have been produced in `` resolved '' photoproduction processes involving the parton distribution functions inside the photon ; however , we found that they are not sensitive to our model , since the cross section is suppressed by a factor @xmath48 and the integrated luminosity is not very high .",
    "table  [ tab : datasets ] shows the cuts which we use for the simulations . since we focus on di  muon events , we only cut on the momenta of these muons . in case of the ua1 experiment ,",
    "the cuts can be taken directly from their analyses of di  muon data @xcite .",
    "the fixed  target experiments are more difficult to simulate , since not enough information is provided in their analyses of di  muon data to completely determine their acceptance region .",
    "it should be noted that these analyses were optimized for drell  yan muon pairs , which to leading order emerge back  to  back in the partonic center of mass system .",
    "this is usually not the case for the muon pairs from @xmath0 decays .",

    "as in the previous subsection we need @xmath51{gev}$ ] to reproduce the in  cone multi  muon invariant mass distribution .",

    "hence , a fixed  target experiment with good spatial coverage can test even this most difficult model decisively , if the vertex resolution is sufficient to detect the decay length of the @xmath0 particles .",
    "in this paper we investigated the question whether cdf `` ghost '' events could have been detected by experiments operating at lower energies .",
    "the answer to this question depends on the model chosen to describe the cdf data .",
    "we started by constructing a simple model , in which two light @xmath0 particles are produced in an s  wave , and decay into four  body final states containing at least one muon , with a decay length of 20 mm . as far as we can tell",
    ", this model describes the di  muon ghost sample fairly well ; recall that this accounts for more than 90% of all ghost events . since",
    "the @xmath0 particles are light , they could be produced not only at the cern sps collider , but also in fixed ",
    "target collisions at fermilab .",
    "the latter should have accumulated hundreds to thousands of such events in their data , depending on whether @xmath0 pair production is dominated by gluon fusion or by @xmath42 annihilation . in half of these events both muons",
    "should have the same charge ; there is very little physics background for such like  sign pairs at fixed ",
    "target energies , where @xmath19 production is suppressed ( which can lead to like  sign pairs via @xmath62 oscillations ) .",
    "unfortunately the published analyses of di  muon data from these experiments are based on triggers that require the presence of two opposite  sign muons in the event .",
    "some experiments evidently also recorded same  sign pairs , but the effective luminosities and efficiencies for these are not stated . on the other hand ,",
    "at least one of the experiments , fermilab e789 , should have had no trouble detecting the typical @xmath0 decay length of several cm .",
    "however , this simple model does not reproduce the ghost events with more than two muons very well .",
    "it does not predict sufficiently many secondary muons with the same charge as the primary one , and it predicts a too steep fall  off of the multi ",
    "muon invariant mass distribution .",
    "the first problem can be cured by allowing @xmath0 decays to violate @xmath50 and @xmath49 number , still respecting the overall lepton number , while the second problem can be solved by assuming that @xmath0 pair production proceeds via a very broad resonance @xmath1 .",
    "this more complicated model still predicts that the ua1 di ",
    "muon sample should contain an appreciable number of ghost events ; however , these would be overwhelmed by di ",
    "muon events from conventional sources , in particular from @xmath19 production , unless the long decay length of the @xmath0 particles could be detected .",
    "moreover , this model predicts that few or no ghost events should be contained in the fermilab fixed  target di  muon data .",
    "however , these data were subjected to angular cuts that isolate drell  yan events , but are very inefficient for ghost events .",
    "we saw that a fixed ",
    "target experiment with good angular coverage and sufficient tracking resolution to detect the finite @xmath0 decay length should be able to decisively probe even this more complex model .    given the spectacular nature of the ghost events , it seems unlikely to us that they would have escaped detection , had they been produced at rates similar to those predicted by our simple model .",
    "however , a proper analysis can only be performed by the experimental groups themselves ; this is true in particular in view of the apparently quite complicated acceptances of these experiments .",
    "we hope that this paper , and the ghost models we constructed and embedded into herwig++ , will facilitate such analyses ."
