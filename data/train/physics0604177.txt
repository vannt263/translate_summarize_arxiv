    "electron transfer lies at heart of all bioenergetic processes .",
    "the energy of photoexcited electronic states , or one released in the oxidative breakdown of food molecules is used in a chain of electron - transfer reactions to create the transmembrane proton gradient storing ultimately the free energy ready to use in such `` energetic '' organels of biological cells as mitochondria and chloroplasts @xcite .",
    "this electrochemical proton gradient is used there by the atp - syntase molecular complexes to synthesise the molecules of adenosintriphosphate ( atp )  a free - energy `` currency '' utilised in the most biochemical cellular processes which occur far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium under the living cell conditions .",
    "it is well known that the atp - syntase can work also in reverse using the energy of atp hydrolysis to restore the proton gradient @xcite .",
    "the existence of the reverse electron transfer , where the energy of atp hydrolysis , or the free energy derived from electrochemical transmembrane gradient of a sort of ions is used to energise the electrons , is coming gradually in the focus of attention @xcite .",
    "the proton pumping molecular complexes driven normally by the energy released in the downhill electron transfer can work in reverse , pumping the electrons uphill on the time scale of seconds and minutes @xcite .",
    "it might even be the case that such reverse electron transfer evolutionary emerged earlier in archaebacteria existing at extremal environmental conditions ( i.e. , during the most earliest steps of the biological evolution ) .",
    "moreover , the nitrogen fixation , which is realized by the nitrogenase protein complexes , utilises apparently the energy released in atp hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "these natural molecular nanomachines produce ammonia routinely , at normal conditions , while the standard industrial technological process requires large pressures of about 150 atmospheres and temperatures in the range of 650 - 720 k.    the electron transfer in nitrogenase provides one of the key steps in the overall reaction of ammonia synthesis .",
    "it is realized through a long - distance ( about 14  ) nonadiabatic electron tunnelling between two different metalloclusters situated in two different protein subunits .",
    "this process is gated by nonequilibrium conformational transitions of the whole protein complex due to atp binding and hydrolysis , with two atp molecules hydrolysed per one electron transferred .",
    "how nitrogenase works remains still a mystery , but a proper physical understanding gradually emerges @xcite .",
    "such understanding is crucial not only for uncovering the working principles of biological nanomachinery in general , but also for the molecular design of such and similar molecular machines for a future nanobiotechnological use .",
    "it would allow for an intelligent parameter optimisation , performing ultimately better than nature .",

    "it is necessary to block the reverse acceptor - to - donor electron transfer in the conformation 1 .",
    "temporal lifting of the electron energy is possible , e.g. due to binding a negatively charged atp molecule nearby the corresponding site of localisation .",

    "this presents one of the basic theories of electron transfer in molecular systems @xcite .",
    "of course , it is not truly universal , but it does provide a milestone and the simplest theoretical framework of practical relevance .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that the electron - transferring protein complex ( or its corresponding molecular subunit ) can be in either of two conformations depending on binding a ligand , say atp molecule ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this assumption is quite in spirit of the monod - wyman - changeux model of allosteric enzymes @xcite .",
    "these two conformations possess very different @xmath5 ( distance between the donor and acceptor sites is changed , or some bridging molecular group changes its orientation interrupting , or vice versa , establishing thereby the electron - tunnelling pathway ) .",
    "these conformations can correspond also to very different energy differences between the localised electron levels , e.g. the energy of the donor or acceptor state is changed ( atp and the hydrolysis products , adp and the phosphate group @xmath35 , are all charged and the electrostatic effects are of utmost importance here @xcite ) .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) become stochastic functions of time . alternatively , a strong two - state stochastic electric field can be externally applied to drive the electron transfer process .",
    "this is the starting point of the stochastically driven spin - boson model of refs .",
    "it must be noted that modelling of the equilibrium conformational fluctuations in such a way should be considered with a great care @xcite ( see also below ) , but the approach suits well to model non - equilibrium fluctuations like those considered @xcite . within the approximations leading to eqs .",
    "( [ pauli])-([q - fun ] ) , the quantum rates entering equations ( [ pauli ] ) become stochastic _ functionals _ of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "if @xmath38 and @xmath37 fluctuate slow on the time scale of @xmath43 , one can use an _ adiabatic driving _",
    "approximation resulting in fluctuating rates following to the instantaneous values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "this approximation is reasonable as a simple starting point for modelling and it can be justified in many cases . for these reasons , it is used below .",
    "the discussed adiabatic assumption means that after every conformational jump the _ vibrational _ relaxation to the new equilibrium of the vibrational degrees of freedom occurs very fast as compare with the mean duration of time spent in the corresponding conformation .",
    "otherwise , the adiabatic driving approximation can not be justified and the theory becomes essentially more intricate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that the conformational fluctuations are markovian and occur with the rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 which do not depend on where the electron is localised , but are controlled by thermodynamically nonequilibrium concentrations of atp , adp , @xmath35 in the solution ( i.e. atp is continuously supplied @xcite ) . to be more concrete , let us assume that the conformational transition `` 1@xmath46 2 '' is caused by the atp binding to the electron - transferring molecular complex ( scheme i ) .",
    "then , the transition rate @xmath44 should obviously be proportional to the atp concentration , [ atp ] , in the solution , i.e. @xmath47 $ ] , since the binding frequency is proportional to [ atp ] .",
    "on the contrary , the rate @xmath45 of the conformational transition `` 2@xmath461 '' caused by the atp hydrolysis and the products dissociation should not depend on [ atp ] , but be rather determined by the activation barrier between two conformations and the energy released by breaking the phosphate bond .",
    "such nonequilibrium fluctuations fuelled by this , or another source of chemical energy can drive electron transfer ( et ) uphill . alternatively , they can be induced by an externally applied stochastic electric field @xcite .",
    "it can either be directly coupled to the electron transfer @xcite , or modulate the electron levels indirectly , via the electroconformational coupling @xcite .",
    "then , within the discussed approximations , the et transfer kinetics is described by the kinetic equations ( [ pauli ] ) with time - dependent rates undergoing two - state markovian fluctuations .",
    "formally , this is a typical problem of dynamical disorder @xcite .",
    "it can equivalently be described by the four - state markovian kinetic scheme depicted in fig .",

    "they obviously satisfy the master equations @xmath51 these equations describe the process at thermodynamical equilibrium if the overall stationary flux is absent , i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise fluxes are mutually compensated .",
    "this requires that the product of forward rates along the cycle is equal to the product of backward rates , see e.g. in @xcite .",
    "otherwise , a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) emerges with a persistent flux present .",
    "in such a case , one either requires a free energy supply to produce the corresponding stochastic cyclic motion ( uphill motion on an effective free energy landscape ) , or this energy will be released ( in the downhill motion ) .",
    "let us consider the situation where the averaged free energy bias @xmath52 is negative , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the stationary probabilities of the corresponding conformations ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] is required to pump the electrons against the averaged free energy bias @xmath53  the case of our interest here .",
    "if ness corresponds to the clockwise total probability flux in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the roles of donor and acceptor states are interchanged and the conformational fluctuations can be driven by the energy released in the downhill electron transfer .",
    "these conformational fluctuations can in turn be coupled to an ion flux to produce the uphill ion flow against the corresponding electrochemical gradient .",
    "this is the operating principle of the electron - driven proton pumps @xcite .",
    "the details are , of course , much more involved ( a more complex , extended kinetic scheme is required to describe these processes in a consistent manner ) and still not completely understood .",
    "the operating principle is , however , rather clear due to ( nonlinear ) nonequilibrium thermodynamics considerations . in the present context ,",
    "we combine them with a quantum treatment of the electron transfer kinetics .",

    "this energy can be delivered , e.g. , due to the atp hydrolysis ( breaking the energy rich phosphate bond ) , or derived from any other free energy source ( the proton gradient , for example , via protonation / deprotonation of the molecular pump ) . obviously , if only the tunnelling matrix element is modulated by the conformational transitions , then no pumping is possible and the described scheme agrees with the thermodynamic equilibrium , since no overall flux is present .",
    "we return back to the well - known problem of dynamical disorder in equilibrium systems and no more .",

    "it is worth to notice that the very existence of the inverted et regime presents a profoundly quantum - mechanical feature of nonadiabatic et .",
    "therefore , such an electron pump would be essentially quantum - mechanical",
    ". however , such a pumping scenario based on the sole modulation of @xmath38 would be rather inefficient and too demanding for the system parameters in practice .",
    "therefore , it is not likely to be used by nature . on the contrary ,",

    "[ fig1 ] . in the reality",
    ", a combination of both possibilities can take place .",
    "for example , in the case of nitrogenase the donor level is lifted by 300 mev and the acceptor level increases simultaneously by 100 mev , with the total increase of the driving energy bias by 200 mev @xcite .",
    "this compares well with the energy release from the hydrolysis of one atp molecule which is about @xmath61 ev under the living cell conditions .",

    "however , for the scheme i it might be the case that the electron affinity to d2 state is much smaller than to d1 , i.e. the protein binds the transferring electron with a much higher probability in the first conformation ( when no negatively charged atp is bound nearby the donor state ) .",

    "the profound physical difference between the ionic and electronic pumps is , however , that the electron is essentially a quantum particle and it tunnels over a large distance between metalloclusters in nitrogenase ( also in other electron transfer complexes , like cytochrome @xmath174 ) using virtually protein bridging states .",
    "this is why the _ details _ here are definitely very different from ionic pumps .",

    "<S> the simplest mechanism for molecular electron pumps is discussed which is based on nonadiabatic electron tunnelling and nonequilibrium conformational fluctuations . </S>",
