    "during the last decades there has been great interest in the model of a harmonic oscillator confined to boxes of different shapes and sizes@xcite .",
    "such model has been suitable for the study of several physical problems ranging from dynamical friction in star clusters@xcite to magnetic properties of solids@xcite and impurities in quantum dots@xcite .",
    "one of the most widely studied model is given by a particle confined to a box with impenetrable walls at @xmath0 and @xmath1 bound by a linear force that produces a parabolic potential  energy function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath4 the problem is symmetric and the eigenfunctions are either even or odd ; such symmetry is broken when @xmath5 . although interesting in itself , this model is rather artificial because the cause of the force is not specified .",
    "it may , for example , arise from an infinitely heavy particle clamped at @xmath6 .",
    "in such a case we think that it is more interesting to consider that the other particle also moves within the box .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the discussion of the model of two particles confined to a one  dimensional box with impenetrable walls . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the force between them is linear . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model and discuss some of its general mathematical properties . in sec .",

    "we clearly appreciate that the separation just outlined is not possible in the confined model .    when @xmath28 the transformations that leave the hamiltonian operator ( including boundary conditions ) invariant are : identity @xmath29 and inversion @xmath30 .",

    "the simple variational functions developed some time ago @xcite and adapted to present problem in sec .  [ sec : large_l ] provide remarkably accurate energies for all values of the box size and are , for that reason , most useful to show the connection between both regimes and to verify the accuracy of more elaborate numerical calculations ."
