    "the current interest for dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( hereafter dsphs ) as satellites of the milky way is raised by two fundamental questions concerning their evolution : the real content of dark matter ( dm ) in these objects ( see , for example , mateo @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; piatek & pryor @xcite ; burkert @xcite and references therein ) and their implication in the hierarchical formation of the galactic halo ( e.g. , johnston et al .",

    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy is the closest known satellite galaxy to the center of the milky way , @xmath0 kpc ( ibata et al .",

    "important problems concerning this system are : 1 ) its possible lifetime before dissolution , 2 ) the possible presence of dm in it .",
    "a critical point in the studies mentioned above is the question whether sgr is in virial equilibrium or not .",
    ".observational parameters of sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al .",
    "@xcite ) [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the second case , according to cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation , satellite systems are produced around massive galaxies .",
    "these satellites could contain dm halos ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "tidal forces could be negligible in the outer regions of the galaxy where the satellite is formed .",
    "however , if we assume that the satellite does not go through the denser and central regions of the main galaxy in the first perigalacticon , we could expect that an initially massive satellite falls slowly on the center of the galaxy by dynamical friction , loses part of its mass and reaches a central orbit . in this way , the satellite has time to modify its internal structure and to reach the equilibrium with the environment .",
    "dsphs described in the two last scenarios have to be in equilibrium with the tidal forces of the environment . in the paper by gmez - flechoso & domnguez - tenreiro ( @xcite ) , the structural parameters ( total mass , @xmath1 , velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , core radius , @xmath3 , etc . ) of a satellite in the tidal field of the primary galaxy have been estimated .",
    "those authors have proved that , in general , a galaxy in a tidal field can be described by a two parameter distribution function .",
    "they have solved altogether the poisson equation and the collisionless boltzmann equation for a galaxy , taking into account the potential of the galaxy and the tidal potential of the environment . only spherical terms of the tidal field",
    "were considered in this theory . however , the obtained _ equilibrium _ solutions are better representations of the system than _ isolated _ models .",
    "this result suggests that in our problem we could represent a dsph in equilibrium with the tidal field of the primary galaxy as a _ modified king s sphere _ ( see gmez - flechoso & domnguez - tenreiro @xcite ) with two free parameters . we have chosen the central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , and the core radius , @xmath3 , as input parameters , because both can be determined from observations . in our simulations ,",
    "the values for these two parameters are @xmath4  kpc and @xmath5  km / s , which reproduce the characteristics of the milky way satellites .",
    "thus , we will try to explain the sagittarius satellite as a typical dsph which has evolved orbiting for a long time in the galaxy potential .",
    "the other parameters of the model ( total mass , tidal radius and dimensionless central potential ) are automatically determined by the tidal potential at each position of the orbit .",
    "the satellite parameters of the models which have been performed are listed in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the second column is the core radius , @xmath3 , and the third column is the central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , which are input parameters of the modified king s spheres .",
    "the total mass , @xmath1 , the dimensionless central potential , @xmath6 , and the tidal radius , @xmath7 , ( columns 4 , 5 and 6 ) are output parameters obtained by solving the collisionless boltzmann equation with the tidal potential at the averaged distance of the orbit to the galaxy center ( parameter @xmath8 in table [ tbl2 - 2 ] ) .    as it can be seen in table [ tbl2 ] , the dimensionless central potential and the mass of the satellite decrease for inner positions of the equilibrium satellite for models with the same @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the models is smaller than the mass inferred from observations using kinematic arguments ( ibata et al .",
    "@xcite , mateo @xcite ) and it is in agreement with the observed luminous mass , assuming @xmath9 m@xmath10l@xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we have assumed @xmath12 m@xmath10l@xmath11 for all the s - models , that is a typical value for the stellar population of a dsph .",
    "the low value of the mass - to - luminosity ratio is in agreement with satellites either formed in tidal tails of major accretion events or tidally modified by orbiting for a long time in a tidal potential .",
    "the apocenter , @xmath13 , the pericenter , @xmath14 , and the period of the orbits are listed in table [ tbl2 - 2 ] .",
    "the s - a orbit is an orbit of low eccentricity in the inner region of the galaxy and s - b1 and s - b2 orbits have higher eccentricity .",
    "the models have been evolved using the treecode algorithm kindly provided by barnes & hut ( @xcite ) with a tolerance parameter @xmath15 and a time - step @xmath16 myr .",
    "the number of particles of the luminous and dark halo components of the primary galaxy are 15671 and 29648 , respectively , and the mass of the dark matter particles is 3 times larger that for the luminous particles .",
    "all the satellite models have 4000 equal - mass particles , except s - b2a and s - b2c which have 8000 particles .",
    "we use a softening length varying proportionally to the cubic root of the particle mass of the component , in order to avoid well - known usual numerical effects in the simulations ( e.g. merritt @xcite ; theis & spurzem @xcite ) . for the luminous particles of the galaxy it is @xmath17 kpc and for the dark matter halo @xmath18 kpc .",
    "the f - models have @xmath19 kpc , but this value is changed to @xmath20 kpc for the s - a , s - b1 and s - b2b satellites and @xmath21 kpc for the s - b2a and s - b2c satellites .",
    "the main galaxy develops a bar - like structure , described by fux ( @xcite ) for an isolated model of our galaxy .",
    "the global effects of the satellite on the primary galaxy are weak , since the mass ratio of both objects is huge .",
    "besides , the poor resolution of the galaxy model prevents a detailed description of the local effects of the sagittarius accretion on the milky way .",
    "therefore , we only deal with dynamical effects felt by the satellite galaxy .      for our f - models , we begin the simulations when the satellite has already reached the inner regions of the primary galaxy .",
    "a dsph galaxy on a low eccentricity orbit in these inner dense regions of the galaxy undergoes stronger disruptions than on more eccentric orbits , because the tidal forces are stronger at all positions on the trajectory .      in fig .",
    "[ f2]a ( b ) , we plot the angular distribution of the f - a satellite along ( perpendicular to ) the orbit ( which has eccentricity @xmath22 ) as seen from 24 kpc away ( it corresponds to the solar neighbourhood viewpoint ) , for four snapshots . in this case , the lifetime of the dwarf galaxy , before significant disruption , is nearly 0.4 gyrs ( fig . [",
    "f3]a ) .    the material from the satellite galaxy is tidally stripped , forming a long stream and then , after 1.2 gyrs , an almost close great circle in an aitoff projection , which survives for a long time ( fig .",

    "[ f2]b , the mean width perpendicular to the orbit on the sky is @xmath23 ( it was only @xmath24 at the initial time ) and the projected surface brightness ( fig . [",

    "for both f - b1 and f - b2 orbits ( @xmath25 and 0.75 , respectively ) , disruption mainly occurs at perigalacticon , because tidal forces are more efficient at small galactocentric radii .",
    "the lifetime of a satellite depends strongly on the orbit shape .",
    "the f - b1 satellite is destroyed after 0.5 gyr ( fig .",
    "[ f3]b ) whereas the f - b2 satellite survives for 1 gyr ( fig .",
    "[ f3]c ) due to the longer period of its orbit , at this time the f - b2 satellite undergoes a close _ interaction _",
    "( @xmath26 kpc ) with the center of the primary galaxy and it is tidally destroyed .",
    "the final destruction of dwarf galaxies is more efficient in our more eccentric orbits and they present fainter surface brightness at the end of the simulation than the satellite on a low eccentric orbit ( fig .",
    "the satellite particles of f - b models are spread over all directions and no predominant streams are formed , as it can be seen in fig .",

    "[ f2]d and [ f2]f , we have represented the width ( perpendicular to the orbit ) of the stream . at the end of the simulations ,",
    "the f - b2 models do not have any predominant peak in the mass distribution perpendicularly to the initial orbit .    as a general result , due to the tidal field on the satellite we observe : i ) a modification of the internal structure of the satellite for both cases of orbits ( eccentric and quasi - circular ) , with increase of the projected velocity dispersion , and ii ) a continuous loss of satellite mass and luminosity .",
    "anyone tempted to infer a @xmath27 ratio from such experiments by assuming virial conditions would find values @xmath28 times higher than the true ones at the disruption time ( fig .",

    ", we analyze the interaction effects on a dsph in equilibrium with the galaxy potential .",
    "either it could have fallen down slowly from an intermediate region in the denser parts of the primary galaxy , loosing part of its mass and becoming a low dm satellite , or it could have been formed in a tidal tail of a major accretion event .",
    "dsphs which are theoretical equilibrium solutions to sgr at a circular inner orbit are small and low mass galaxies .",
    "the tidal field is almost constant along this quasi - circular orbit and , therefore , interaction effects on the satellites in equilibrium are not important . for the s - a orbit , there is a continuous loss of mass , but the satellite has still @xmath29 of the initial mass ( fig .",

    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion grows in the outer parts of the satellite in agreement with findings by k97 , remaining almost constant in average in the inner parts ( @xmath31 kpc ) ( fig .",
    "we have calculated the mass inferred from the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , measured inside a radius of 0.5 kpc from the satellite center , using eq .",
    "( [ ml ] ) . since the central velocity dispersion and the projected density ( fig .",

    "however , as we have explained above , the real mass of the satellite decreases and it is only @xmath29 of the initial value after 2 gyrs .",
    "the structural evolution is slow ( fig .",

    "this effect could be dramatically increased if the velocity dispersion is measured inside a larger radius , because of the velocity dispersion increase in the outer region of the satellite , leading to a calculated @xmath27 ratio up to 10 times larger than the real one .",
    "very faint tidal streams are formed , which are spread along @xmath32 of the orbit with a spatial width @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) .",

    "we have selected three different satellite models for orbiting on this trajectory ( s - b2a , s - b2b and s - b2c ) .",
    "the concentration ( defined as @xmath34 ) varies from 1.28 ( s - b2a ) to 0.83 ( s - b2c ) .",

    "summing up the results obtained in our simulations and comparing them with other published works , we agree with other authors ( velzquez & white @xcite ; ibata & lewis @xcite ) that sgr dsph has a short period orbit ( @xmath80 gyr ) .",
    "this constraint comes from measurement of the position and the radial velocity of sgr dsph in a realistic model of the galaxy .",
    "however , we disagree about the dm content .",
    "these previous works claim that sgr dsph is a dm dominated satellite , because , contrary to us , they could not obtain a low mass satellite which survives by orbiting in the potential of the galaxy . therefore , they can not explain the complex evolutionary pattern inferred for the sagittarius dsph , which has suffered a chemical enrichment and evolution and the age interval of its globular clusters which suggests a long life orbiting in the galaxy .",
    "ibata & lewis ( @xcite ) have tested low massive models in order to reproduce the sgr dsph characteristics , reaching an unsuccessful result on the matter and concluding that sgr dsph must have a large dm content .",
    "there are two differences between their study and ours .",
    "firstly , they use a rigid potential to model the galaxy , so no energy interchange is allowed between the satellite and the galaxy .",
    "this restriction could eventually prevent a readjusting of the internal energy of the satellite in order to reach an equilibrium with the environment .",
    "even if the energy transfer from the satellite to the halo is not important in all cases , we emphasize that our treatment is _ a priori _ adaptable to satellites of various masses . secondly ( and mainly )",
    ", ibata & lewis ( @xcite ) do not take into account the tidal potential of the galaxy as they build their satellite model .",
    "we have confirmed that the fate of such satellites is different from that of the satellites in equilibrium with the tidal potential as considered here .",
    "consequently , a more accurate model of the initial satellite , that reflects the true dynamical situation of the dsph , is required in order to avoid spurious effects in the simulations .",
    "these differences in the models are responsible for the opposite conclusions reached by ibata & lewis , compared with ours concerning dm .",
    "furthermore , the recent observations of sgr by mateo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) prove the existence of a long trailing tail , which supports the hypothesis that sgr dsph has suffered strong tidal forces , it is close to disruption and , therefore , it is not in virial equilibrium .",
    "the existence of this tail also reduces the inferred @xmath27 ratio .",
    "our low dm satellites ( _ modified king s models _ ) establish important restrictions on the satellite formation theory .",
    "thus , the satellite galaxies grow either in a quasi - isolated region ( falling slowly on the center of the primary galaxy and having time for readjusting their internal structure to the tidal forces ) , or inside the main galaxy , in the tidal tails of a major accretion event , which automatically implies equilibrium with the tidal forces at the satellite formation epoch .",
    "furthermore , the survival time of the _ equilibrium _ satellites in the potential of the galaxy depend on the initial concentration of the dsph ( the larger concentration , the longer the life - time ) .",
    "we have obtain models ( i.e. , s - b2a ) which survive more than 10 gyr .",
    "the evolution of these satellites gives rise to tidal streams and modifications on the outer velocity dispersion of the satellite and it leads to high observed mass - to - light ratios if dynamical equilibrium is assumed .",
    "we have obtained a rather good qualitative agreement with the observational constraints for the model s - b2c in a time interval ( from @xmath81 to @xmath82 gyr ) , although this agreement is not achieved simultaneously on all the constraints .",
    "we remind that the simulation time does not necessarily correspond with the age of the oldest globular cluster of sgr and , therefore , the s - b2c model is not necessarily in disagreement with the observations . in this case ,",
    "two possibilities could be invoked to explain the age of the oldest sgr globular clusters : ( i ) either the satellite has been orbiting for a long time in a more external region ( where tidal forces are smaller ) , it suffers dynamical friction or / and a deflection with a dense structure of the mw and it reaches the present orbit where , eventually , it is disrupted , or ( ii ) it has formed in a tidal tail which contained an old stellar population ( kroupa @xcite ) .",
    "the tidal tail models illustrate that a dsph without dm orbiting through central regions of the galactic potential could preserve its structural parameters for a long time .",
    "later on , the dsph could show high inferred @xmath27 values as it becomes disrupted .",
    "the only restriction of the model is that the satellite must reach the central regions of the galaxy in equilibrium with the tidal forces . that could be possible whether the satellite has been formed in a tidal tail of an accretion event or it has been slowly accreted from the external parts of the galaxy",
    ". the latter possibility could increased the estimated life - time of the satellite before destruction .",
    "recently , k98 has discussed the parameter space of the dsphs which could survive in a tidal field . in spite of the different initial distribution functions , our s - models seem to be located in the available region of the ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) space for surviving satellites . however , the main difference between the approaches to the problem is that we build the model of the satellite initially in equilibrium with the tidal forces by solving the boltzmann equation ( gmez - flechoso & domnguez - tenreiro @xcite ) and that assures _ a priori _ the survival of the satellite for a long time .",
    "we have performed simulations of sagittarius - like satellites to follow the evolution of these systems .",
    "the satellite and the primary galaxy are modelled as n - body systems , that prevents possible purely numerical effects which could appear in a non - selfgraviting scheme ( i.e. if one of the interacting system is represented by a rigid potential ) .",
    "two satellite models have been tested :    1 .   first of all , we have used _ isolated king s models _ ( three free parameter models ) for the satellite , but they are tidally stripped and destroyed in a short interval of time , undergoing a fast evolution .",
    "2 .   in order to correctly model the observed situation we had to introduce the _ modified king s models _ ( two free parameters - models ) , which allow us to build up the distribution function of the satellite , taking into account the tidal force of the environment . these s - models could correspond to no dm dominated satellites . in this framework ,",
    "the initial concentration of the satellite and the trajectory determine its life - time .",
    "central circular orbits lead to more effective tidal destruction events than highly eccentric orbits . for a given kind of orbit , the most concentrated satellites live longer .",
    "the model which better reproduces the observations is the s - b2c model after orbiting 5.38 - 5.6 gyr in the potential of the milky way .",
    "for the same orbits , the s - models survive a longer time orbiting in the galactic potential than the f - models , despite the s - models having smaller masses ( smaller binding energies ) .      1 .   sagittarius may not be a dominated dm satellite .",
    "2 .   it follows an eccentric orbit ( perigalacticon and apogalacticon are approximately 15 and 70 kpc ) .",
    "it was more concentrated in the past than at the present epoch .",
    "it could have been orbiting in the galactic halo for a long time ( minimum 5 gyr ) .      1 .",
    "high values of @xmath27 found in the literature ( ibata et al .",
    "@xcite ; irwin & hatzidimitriou @xcite ; mateo @xcite for a review of the galactic satellites ) could be due to an erroneous use of the virial theorem and not to the presence of dm ( as already suggested by k97 ; kk98 ) .",
    "2 .   the progenitor of these satellite could be either lumps formed in a major accretion event or other dwarf galaxies ( maybe dwarf irregulars or dwarf spirals ) which fall in the potential well of the galaxy , lose their gas content and evolve to the equilibrium configuration in the tidal field of the milky way , giving rise to the population of dsphs .",
    "the finding of intermediate states of this evolution could be a support to the proposed scenario .",
    "3 .   according to some of the present results , some dsphs are able to survive for long times orbiting in the galactic halo .",
    "that should be taken into account for the calculations of the dissolution rate of dwarf galaxies in the halo of the primary galaxy .",
    "we would like to thank d. pfenniger and d. friedli for critically reading the paper , as well as the referee for remarks which have led to clarify various points of the paper .",
