    "that is , @xmath700 expand this in taylor series with the help of maple , and this yields exactly the series ( [ v - specc ] ) .",
    "so we can be double - sure that formula in theorem [ thm - spec ] is correct . + on the other hand , if we use ( [ expl - taylor ] ) for the point @xmath701 , we get @xmath702 this is exactly what the series ( [ v - specc ] ) and the last identity in ( [ v - inv ] ) would give .",
