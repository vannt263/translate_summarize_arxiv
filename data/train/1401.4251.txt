    "graphical models , such as factor graphs and normal factor graphs @xcite @xcite , can provide a concise description of the probabilistic assumption of an inference problem and they are indispensable for analyzing message passing inference algorithms such as bp ( belief propagation ) .",
    "for example , the relationship between `` codes and graphs '' is one of key concepts of modern coding theory .",
    "al - bashabsheh and mao @xcite recently shed a new light to normal factor graphs .",
    "they clearly showed that _ holographic transformations _ to normal factor graphs are versatile tools for deriving non - trivial identities on the partition function of a normal factor graph @xcite .",
    "a holographic transformation is a local graphical transformation that preserves the partition function .",
    "it should be remarked that the holographic transformation has been used in many research fields .",
    "the prominent example is the class of holographic algorithms invented by valiant @xcite .",
    "he showed that several combinatorial enumeration problems defined on planer graphs can be transformed into perfect matching problems via appropriate holographic transformations .",
    "such a planar perfect matching problem is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "another example is duality theorems @xcite @xcite @xcite for codes defined on graphs .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a non - trivial expression , that is called _ dual expression _ , of the posterior values for a non - adaptive group testing problem .",
    "the derivation is based on a holographic transformation to the normal factor graph representing a group testing inference problem .",
    "the derivation process has similarities to the proof of macwilliams identity @xcite and a bitwise map decoding algorithm by hartmann and rudolph @xcite for binary linear codes .",
    "however , in our case , we can not rely on the standard fourier ( _ i.e. , _ hadamard ) transformation because we need to treat or constraints instead of even parity constraints . a local linear transformation matched to or constraints plays a key role for the following discussion .",
    "the research of group testing started from the celebrated work by dorfman @xcite and has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "we here suppose the following simplest setting for a non - adaptive group testing .",
    "assume that we have @xmath0-_objects _ and some groups of these objects .",
    "each object can take value 1 ( positive ) or 0 ( negative ) according to the prior probability for each object .",
    "test _ can be applied for each predetermined group .",
    "the result of a test is positive if the group contains a positive object ; otherwise the test result becomes negative .",
    "our inference problem is to evaluate the posterior probabilities for objects from @xmath1-disjunctive test results and from our knowledge on the prior probabilities .",
    "development of fast inference algorithms evaluating posterior probabilities ( or their estimates ) is an active area of research ; for example , see approximate inference algorithms based on bp @xcite @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5)$ ] be a binary ( zero or one ) independent random variable representing the state of the @xmath6-th object ( _ i.e. , _ negative or positive ) .",
    "the notation @xmath7 $ ] represents consecutive integers from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the vector of the random variables @xmath10 is thus distributed according to the joint distribution : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "we suppose that an inference algorithm perfectly knows these prior probabilities @xmath13 .",
    "assume that an undirected bipartite graph @xmath14 , called a _ pooling graph _",

    "our goal is to evaluate the log posterior probability ratio defined by @xmath39.\\ ] ] the probability @xmath40 is the posterior probability on @xmath41-th object . from @xmath42",
    ", we can obtain an estimate vector @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 ( \\ell \\in [ 1,n ] ) $ ] where this estimation rule can be seen as the bitwise map estimation rule .",
    "it may be reasonable to consider the bitwise map estimation for this group testing problem because bitwise map estimation minimizes the bitwise estimation error probability . by using bayes theorem ,",
    "the posterior probability can be rewritten as @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is just a normalization constant and @xmath47 . as a simplified notation ,",
    "if the domain of the variable is missing in a summation , all the possible values in the domain is taken to evaluate the sum .",
    "as in many similar bitwise map estimation problems , naive evaluation according to ( [ exponential ] ) requires exponential time with the number of variables @xmath0 to marginalize all the variables @xmath48 ; namely computation time is @xmath2 if the maximum size of @xmath21 is bounded by a constant .",
    "this prohibitive time complexity is the high burden to exploit the bitwise map estimation on this problem .",
    "although it is still exponential time , the exponent of computation time can be greatly reduced if we are aware of the following simple fact .    if @xmath49 , then we have @xmath50 for any @xmath51 .    proof : if @xmath49 , then @xmath52 should be 0 for any @xmath51 because of the relation @xmath53 .",
    "this means that @xmath54 is exactly one .    in other words ,",
    "the lemma states that all the objects in the group @xmath21 have the value zero only if @xmath6-th test result @xmath55 is zero .",
    "this trivial but useful lemma can significantly reduce the problem size if the number of negative objects are small .",
    "therefore , it might be better to redefine the reduced size problem for a given observation vector @xmath56 as follows .",
    "let @xmath57 be the induced subgraph of @xmath58 where the vertices of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 : t_i = 0}\\ { v_k^{(1 ) } \\in v_1   \\mid k \\in \\sigma(i ) \\ }",
