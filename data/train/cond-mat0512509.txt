    "the discovery of superconductivity in plutonium based systems such as pucoga@xmath0@xcite and purhga@xmath0@xcite has stimulated the study of unconventional superconductivity and the pairing symmetry and mechanism in these materials .",
    "the symmetry of an unconventional superconductor is reduced compared to the symmetry of its normal state , thus resulting in many novel properties of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum .",
    "it is believed that the superconducting action in pu-115 [ pu_m_ga@xmath0 with _ m_=co and rh ] derives itself from the unique character of the 5f electrons of plutonium @xcite .",
    "the tetragonal crystal structure of pu_m_ga@xmath0 is isostructural to that of the ce-115 series [ ce_m_in@xmath0 ] .",
    "the purpose of this study is to shed light on the superconducting pairing symmetry and possible pairing mechanism in the pu-115 compounds .",
    "very recently , curro and coworkers @xcite proposed , based on their measurements of the knight shift and spin - lattice relaxation rates , that the pu-115 compounds are bridging the superconducting and normal - state properties of the heavy - fermion ce-115 and high - temperature copper - oxide superconductors . therefore providing a means for tuning the interaction strength of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations to intermediate values between both extreme limits @xcite .",
    "the experimental techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupolar resonance ( nqr ) have been used successfully in the past to distinguish between the spin states of cooper pairs ( spin singlet vs. spin triplet pairing ) and provide indirect information on the symmetry of the gap function  fully gapped vs. nodal lines or nodal points in the gap function on the fermi surface . both techniques probe",
    "directly the quasiparticle density of states and reveal indirect information about the pairing symmetry .",
    "the standard explanation of power vs. exponential laws in the low - temperature behavior of thermodynamic and transport properties , for example , the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath3 , comes from the difference of nodal and fully gapped excitation spectra in the superconducting state .    in clean nodal superconductors @xmath3 exhibits a nearly @xmath4 behavior far below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 , while it is exponential for gapped superconductors . on the other side , deviations from this behavior , like the @xmath6-linear temperature dependence of @xmath3 at low temperatures ,",
    "are explained by impurity effects in an unconventional superconductor ( sc ) with lines of nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "very recently , sakai and coworkers @xcite reported such a result for the spin - lattice relaxation rate of purhga@xmath0  in the superconducting phase .",
    "this behavior closely resembles the spin - lattice relaxation rates measured by curro and coworkers for pucoga@xmath0 , which belongs to the same family of pu-115 compounds , albeit with a @xmath7 nearly twice as high @xcite .",
    "here we give a detailed theoretical description of the spin - lattice relaxation rate and predict what should be observed for the knight shift if measured on the same sample .",
    "our self - consistent treatment of impurity scattering in the superconducting state goes beyond the two - fluid approach used by sakai et al .",
    "@xcite , which was used to explain the large residual density of states in purhga@xmath0 .",
    "simultaneous measurements of spin - lattice relaxation rate and knight shift will place stringent constraints on the symmetry and magnitude of the superconducting gap function , as well as on the concentration and scattering strength of impurities at low temperatures .",
    "the effect of impurity scattering is included within the self - consistent @xmath6-matrix approximation @xcite , which is the standard formulation for pointlike defects in a superconducting dilute alloy @xcite . for the case of particle - hole symmetry of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum the nambu component @xmath8 of the @xmath6 matrix vanishes , and for a d - wave order parameter ( op ) with isotropic scattering @xmath9 ( also without loss of generality we can choose @xmath10 by general u(1 ) gauge symmetry ) , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12th component of the @xmath13 nambu matrix expanded in pauli matrices .",

    "the following gap equation is solved self - consistently , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angular parametrization of the pairing interaction , and @xmath29 is a typical cutoff energy .",
    "we assume the canonical d - wave gap function of the form @xmath30 or @xmath31 for a cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "the pairing potential @xmath32 induces a gap with d - wave symmetry .",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is similarly extrapolated : @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the normal state @xmath65 . in our numerical calculations we chose @xmath66 , because our final results are not very sensitive with respect to this parameter , while the ratio @xmath67 is an important parameter to simulate strong - coupling effects .",

    ", we estimate the superconducting transition temperature of the pristine sample to be @xmath90 k or @xmath91 k , depending on the value of @xmath73 k or @xmath92 k.    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the normalized @xmath3 is plotted for an enhanced strong - coupling d - wave gap value @xmath93 , as was recently found for pucoga@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "due to the larger gap value , the calculated @xmath3 is always less than the measured spin - lattice relaxation rate .",

    "again a modest impurity scattering rate of @xmath97 results in a large residual susceptibility at zero temperature , equivalent to roughly @xmath98 of the normal state dos or spin susceptibility @xmath99 .",

    "the nqr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath3 in purhga@xmath0  is consistent with a strong - coupling d - wave gap function and unitary impurity scattering similar to the observed behavior in its sister compound pucoga@xmath0 .",
    "inspite of many similarities between pucoga@xmath0  and purhga@xmath0 , we also find marked differences : ( 1 ) the maximum superconducting gap value of purhga@xmath0  is smaller than for pucoga@xmath0 , i.e. , it is @xmath102 for purhga@xmath0  versus @xmath103 for pucoga@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the fluctuations of the pairing bosons are weaker for purhga@xmath0 , possibly hinting at a progressive trend for the strength of the spin - fluctuations in this class of materials .",
    "( 2 ) although the purhga@xmath0  sample was of similar age as pucoga@xmath0  when measured , it had a three times larger relative scattering rate @xmath97 compared to pucoga@xmath0  with @xmath104 , which could be due to variations of the isotope mix of plutonium between both samples .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath3 exhibits a rounded behavior between @xmath105 k and @xmath106 k resembling the pseudogap phenomenon in yba@xmath75cu@xmath76o@xmath77 , while no such rounding is observed for pucoga@xmath0 .",
