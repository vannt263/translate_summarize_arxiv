    "quantum simulation of physical systems on a qc has acquired importance during the last years since it is believed that qcs can simulate quantum physics problems more efficiently than their classical analogues @xcite : the number of operations needed for deterministically solving a quantum many - body problem on a classical computer ( cc ) increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom of the system .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "each physical system has associated a language of operators and an algebra realizing this language , and can be considered as a possible model of quantum computation @xcite . as we discussed in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", the existence of one - to - one mappings between different languages ( e.g. , the jordan - wigner transformation that maps fermionic operators onto spin-1/2 operators ) and between quantum states of different hilbert spaces , allows the quantum simulation of one physical system by any other one .",
    "for example , a liquid nuclear magnetic resonance qc ( nmr ) can simulate a system of @xmath0he atoms ( hard - core bosons ) because an isomorphic mapping between both algebras of observables exists .",
    "the existence of mappings between operators allows us to construct quantum network models from sets of elementary gates , to which we map the operators of our physical system .",
    "an important remark is that these mappings can be performed efficiently : we need a number of steps that scales polynomially with the system size .",
    "however , this fact alone is not sufficient to establish that any quantum problem can be solved efficiently .",
    "one needs to show that all steps involved in the simulation ( i.e. , preparation of the initial state , evolution , measurement , and measurement control ) can be performed with polynomial complexity .",
    "for example , the number of different eigenvalues in the two - dimensional hubbard model scales exponentially with the system size , so qc algorithms for obtaining its energy spectrum will also require a number of operations that scales exponentially with the system size @xcite .",
    "typically , the degrees of freedom of the physical system over which we have quantum control constitute the model of computation . in this paper",
    ", we consider the simulation of any physical system by the standard model of quantum computation ( spin-1/2 system ) , since this might be the language needed for the practical implementation of the quantum algorithms ( e.g. , nmr ) .",
    "therefore , the complexity of the quantum algorithms is analyzed from the point of view of the number of resources ( elementary gates ) needed for their implementation in the language of the standard model . had another model of computation being used , one should follow the same qualitative steps although the mappings and network structure would be different .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to show how to simulate any physical process and system using the least possible number of resources .",
    "we organized the paper in the following way : in section [ section2 ] we describe the standard model of quantum computation ( spin-1/2 system )",
    ". section [ section3 ] shows the mappings between physical systems governed by a generalized pauli s exclusion principle ( fermions , etc . ) and the standard model , giving examples of algorithms for the first two steps ( preparation of the initial state and evolution ) of the quantum simulation . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we develop similar steps for the simulation of quantum systems whose language has an infinite - dimensional representation , thus , there is no exclusion principle ( e.g. , canonical bosons ) . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we explain the measurement process used to extract information of some relevant and generic physical properties , such as correlation functions and energy spectra .",
    "we conclude with a discussion about efficiency and quantum errors ( section [ section6 ] ) , and a summary about the general statements ( section [ section7 ] ) .",
    "in the standard model of quantum computation , the fundamental unit is the _ qubit _ , represented by a two level quantum system @xmath1 . for a spin-1/2 particle , for example ,",
    "the two `` levels '' are the two different orientations of the spin , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this model , the algebra assigned to a system of @xmath4-qubits is built upon the pauli spin-1/2 operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 acting on the @xmath8-th qubit ( individual qubit ) .",

    "any unitary operation ( evolution ) @xmath14 applied to a system of @xmath4 qubits can be decomposed into either single qubit rotations @xmath16 by an angle @xmath17 about the @xmath18 axis or two qubits ising interactions @xmath19 .",
    "this is an important result of quantum information , since with these operations one can perform universal quantum computation .",
    "it is important to mention that we could also perform universal quantum computation with single qubit rotations and c - not gates @xcite or even with different control hamiltonians .",
    "the crucial point is that we need to have quantum control over those elementary operations in the real physical system .    in the following",
