    "the investigation of the isovector giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is one of the fundamental problems in nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "these collective excitations can be studied experimentally by photoabsorption processes and provide essential nuclear inputs for the understanding of reaction mechanisms taking place during the synthesis of chemical elements in stars .    despite new successes of recent large accelerator facilities , the information we get on the gdr properties is still limited to about hundred nuclei in the valley of @xmath1 stability .",
    "all the remaining few thousands exotic proton- or neutron - rich nuclei can be accessed by nuclear theory only .",
    "the aim is therefore to provide the necessary theoretical tools towards a universal description of the nuclear structure phenomena , up to the limit of the nuclear stability .    over the years",
    ", a lot of effort has been devoted to improve the theoretical description of the main collective properties , such as the @xmath2-ray strength function .",
    "in particular , the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory , has proven to be a robust theory @xcite . pairing correlations for the study of open - shell nuclei as well as the self - consistent description of the residual interaction @xcite",
    "have also been included over the years .",
    "however , a complete and coherent description of the dynamical properties of the nuclei over the entire nuclear chart remains an open problem and additional corrections beyond the conventional rpa problem are necessary , as discussed the present work .",
    "at first , the coupling to the positive - energy continuum has to be taken into account explicitly .",
    "this is important , because the alternative approach , namely the discretization of the continuum , though simpler , requires a basis truncation , which eventually leads to a mixing between spurious and physical states of the excitation spectrum .",
    "in addition , this discretized rpa includes a large amount of states which increases considerably the numerical effort .",
    "in fact , the exact treatment of the continuum using the green s function representation not only can solve these two problems simultaneously , but also allows for a direct calculation of the escape width of the giant resonance .",
    "although this so - called continuum rpa ( crpa ) is known to be a powerful approach , it has been rarely applied in the past @xcite .",
    "only recently has a continuum qrpa approach been successfully developed within a relativistic framework to study giant multipole resonances for spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many applications , such as nuclear astrophysics , require the estimate of the @xmath2-ray strength function for deformed nuclei . recently , microscopic calculations with axially deformed rpa approaches @xcite have been able to study medium and heavy deformed nuclei showing a considerable success in the prediction of the gdr properties .",
    "in particular they confirm an important effect , namely the splitting of the resonance peak into two components .",
    "unfortunately , the axially deformed rpa faces several difficulties , mostly related to the numerical effort and the isolation of the spurious state . for this reason the deformation effect is still treated in all large - scale calculations in a phenomenological way .",
    "a similar approach is followed in the present work .    the crpa approach @xcite is developed in such a way that only one - particle one - hole ( 1p1h ) configurations are taken into account , so that the coupling to more complex configurations , such as 2p2h , is not described in an explicit way .",
    "these couplings can be taken into account in the framework of the relativistic or nonrelativistic time - blocking approximation @xcite .",
    "however , such a method can not be applied to large - scale calculations yet , essentially due to the numerical effort it represents , so that alternative phenomenological approximations need to be considered @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is followed in the present work , as described in sec .",
    "[ correct ] .    regarding calculations of astrophysical interest , it is of importance to describe not only the photoabsorption processes , but also the reverse radiative particle - capture processes .",
    "reaction theory relates the @xmath2-transmission coefficient for excited states to the ground state photoabsorption assuming the giant resonance to be built on each excited state .",
    "the description of the photo - deexcitation requires however the introduction of a temperature dependence due to collisions between quasiparticles .",
    "as traditionally done , a temperature - dependent gdr width can be applied and has been shown to improve the predictions @xcite .    finally , as far as pairing correlations",
    "are concerned , it has been extensively discussed in the past that the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite or the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) approximation @xcite give a reliable description of both the ground state and the collective excitations of open shell nuclei .",
    "a proper treatment of the pairing correlations is even more important in nuclei close to the drip lines where the pairing gap becomes of the order of the particle emission threshold .",
    "however , this approach is not yet available within the relativistic crpa @xcite , so that open shell nuclei are still treated within the bcs model applied in the mean field as well as the dynamical system .",
    "until an rhb plus crpa is developed , the bcs model can be regarded as a useful approximation of the pairing effect on the @xmath2-ray strength function .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to determine systematically the crpa @xmath0 strength function for the entire nuclear chart within the relativistic mean field approach . for practical applications , all the above mentioned corrections ( correct description of the continuum , spreading width , deformation effects , temperature effects ) are included for a proper prediction of the reaction cross section .",

    "[ crpa ] we briefly describe the relativistic quasiparticle rpa , where the continuum is explicitly included . in sec .",

    "as in all the relativistic models , the nucleons are described as point like dirac particles , which move inside a nuclear mean field .",
    "this mean field is phenomenological and can be described by the exchange of effective mesons , as is done in the walecka model  @xcite or by using the zero range or point coupling terms .",
    "this latter description of the rmf introduced in the early 1990s @xcite has since been improved substantially and is used in our work to describe the ground state and collective properties .",
    "this approach has the main advantage of simplifying considerably the numerical calculations without loosing in predictive power as compared to the meson exchange mean field .    in this work ,",

    ", there is no distinction between e.g. states @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in this way",
    ", the sum over a large number of unbound states is reduced to a sum of only a few @xmath39 states .",
    "in addition , the excitations to the dirac sea ( which includes the antiparticle states ) are taken into account automatically and thus their calculation is redundant .",
    "both these characteristics can lead not only to a substantial reduction of the numerical effort but also to the absence of a corresponding cut - off parameter , as required in the discrete rpa approach @xcite .    as discussed before , for open - shell nuclei ,",

    "although the escape width @xmath43 is estimated microscopically within the crpa , its value remains small , especially for heavy nuclei .",

    "for that same reason , in light nuclei , where the coulomb and centrifugal barriers are smaller , the escape width @xmath43 dominates the total width @xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the total width corresponds to the coupling of the resonance to more complex configurations ( 2p-2h , 3p-3h , etc . ) and its contribution to heavy nuclei is large .",

    "this can be explained by the presence of a strong low - lying crpa strength for neutron - rich nuclei , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] .    a similar , though less pronounced ,",
    "pattern is observed with respect to the nonrelativistic hfb+qrpa approach @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the region between @xmath127sn and @xmath128sn , reaction rates larger by a a ratio of about 5 is found with our crpa approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that the neutron threshold for these nuclei lies at energies close to the pygmy resonance , which is generally more pronounced in the relativistic model .",
    "in contrast , heavier isotopes , i.e. @xmath129sn or above have a neutron threshold below 3 mev and are less affected by the pdr , which , although stronger , lies at higher energies . for this reason ,",
    "both models tend to give rise to similar reaction rates for the most exotic neutron - rich sn isotopes .",
    "calculations based on a relativistic @xcite or nonrelativistic @xcite qtba description of the sn isotopes show a similar behavior when compared to the hfb+qrpa approach @xcite , although the low - lying strength obtained within the time - blocking approximation appears to be more fragmented @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the crpa neutron capture rates to those calculated with the nonrelativistic hfb+qrpa are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for all nuclei with @xmath125 .",
    "globally , the crpa calculation tends to predict larger @xmath0 strength at low energies mainly due to the lower energies at which the pdr dominates . in some very neutron - rich nuclei",
    "the rates calculated with the crpa strength can be about 10 times larger .",
    "finally note that the @xmath78-dependence introduced on the crpa strength in eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) plays a minor role on the neutron capture rates of exotic neutron - rich nuclei since their low neutron separation energy implies a low temperature of the deexciting levels .",
    "starting from a point coupling lagrangian with the parameter set pcf1 @xcite , we have used the relativistic continuum qrpa approach to study the @xmath0 collective excitation spectra of all nuclei between the neutron and proton drip lines .",
    "the rmf equations are solved in the coordinate space self - consistently . for open - shell nuclei ,",
    "the bcs model is applied to treat the pairing correlations .",
    "the residual particle - hole interaction used in the rpa calculations is derived from the same lagrangian in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "a set of two interference factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 is additionally introduced in order to adjust systematically the damping width and the centroid energy of the gdr energy on all photoabsorption data .",
    "in addition , the deformation and temperature effects are included to account for a complete description of the nuclear dynamical problem .",
    "this extended crpa model has been tested for nuclei for which experimental information is available and a satisfactory quantitative agreement is found . in particular , the predicted gdr peak energies globally reproduce experimental data within only a few hundred kevs .    on this basis",
    ", the extended crpa model is used to perform a large - scale calculation of the @xmath0 strength for all nuclei with @xmath95 lying between the proton and neutron drip lines . as far as the collective dipole excitation is concerned ,",
    "a clear pattern around magic numbers is observed on the gdr width and the pdr strength , both being affected by the shell effects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the width also appears to affect the strength in the low - energy region .    for neutron - rich as well as light neutron - deficient nuclei ,",
    "a low - lying pdr strength is found systematically in the 510  mev region .",
    "the corresponding strength can reach 10% of the gdr strength in the neutron - rich region and about 5% in the neutron - deficient region , and is found to be significantly reduced in the vicinity of the shell closures .",
    "finally , the neutron capture reaction rates of neutron - rich nuclei determined with the crpa strength can be about 25 times larger than those predicted on the basis of the nonrelativistic hfb+qrpa strength and up to about 50 times larger than classically determined with the glo model .",
    "we have shown that the present approximation can described rather successfully the collective properties of stable nuclei for which experimental data are available . however , for more exotic nuclei , in particular close to the drip lines , some of the phenomenological corrections used in the present approach need to be replaced by sounder models .",
    "more specifically , an improved treatment of the pairing correlations can be achieved within the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model @xcite and the effects linked to the spreading of the gdr strength beyond the 1p-1h excitations as well as the ground state deformation and odd number of particles need to be tackled following the recent works of @xcite .",
