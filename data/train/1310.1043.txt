    "it is a privilege and a delight to be able to celebrate with all of you here professor freeman dyson s life and achievements on the occasion of his 90th year .",
    "little does freeman know , but he has exerted a profound influence on my own career .",
    "of course i was perfectly well aware of dyson s ground - breaking work on electrodynamics which was one of the first graduate courses we were taught ( by john c taylor and tom kibble at imperial college ) ; what really shaped my own career path was a chance remark made by a physicist , namely hal lewis , at wisconsin university when i was a postdoc during 1963/64 .",
    "the story goes that freeman would bowl over at summer schools , such as the ones in madison or berkeley , and ask what were the most significant problems in physics that year , in order of priority ; he would then go through the list and spend his time solving them !",
    "it revealed a person who was unafraid to tackle the broadest range of subjects in his own inimitable way  someone who had a panoramic view of science and who was prepared to think ` outside the square ' , without getting enmeshed in minutiae of one particular subarea .",
    "as if to reinforce that trait and the breadth of his interests , freeman visited us in tasmania in april 1979 and gave us a stimulating talk on how to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions by concerted planting of new trees ; he would be well pleased that in tasmania today a good one third of the state is being preserved as native forest .",
    "the work i am going to talk about was carried out with mr paul stack , a brilliant phd student with a great aptitude for physics , mathematics and computing : a rare combination .",
    "the research has its genesis in the early days of supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "at that time i was tinkering with the idea of generalizing the auxiliary spinorial coordinate of susy to include internal symmetry labels ( which now goes under the heading of @xmath0-extended supersymmetry ) .",
    "gell - mann was interested in my attempts and , at a conference in london , he had a look at this proposal .",
    "it did not take him long to say that the idea would not fly as it would lead to spin state proliferation of an unacceptable kind , and he was perfectly correct .",
    "so i put the idea on a back - burner and moved on to other more fertile areas .",
    "then , when i migrated to the backwoods of tasmania , a long way from the madding research crowd , i drew inspiration from freeman dyson to resist following the bandwagon  a hopeless enterprise at my separation from the heartthrob of particle physics ( internet notwithstanding )  and try to do my own thing .",
    "dyson s approach to science taught me not to keep up with the jones but rather seek to be a jones myself . over the last few years",
    "i have tried resurrecting the idea of including particle attributes or properties mathematically with the aim of unifying gravity with the other natural forces . , but in a way which differs very radically from spinorial susy .",
    "you can be the judge as to whether we have succeeded in this goal .",
    "a static universe is a contradiction in terms .",
    "everything is inertial and non - interacting , so we would not even be aware of its existence ! on the contrary , the universe evolves and its evolution is punctuated by series of events , defined by    * where and when - location ( x , y , z ) and time ( t ) * what - ( ex)change of property ( @xmath1 )    my emphasis will be on the ` what ' and the overriding question is how to incorporate property or attribute mathematically .",
    "i shall do so using anticommuting complex numbers , of which there are only a finite number , and by the same token the composition of these numbers remains finite .",
    "let us remind ourselves about such @xmath2-numbers ..    anticommuting operators were formulated in the 1920s but anticommuting numbers , invented earlier by grassmann for treating differential geometry , have been used in physics only since about 1970 , when brst and susy came into prominence .",
    "_ c - nos . _ and _ a - nos _ are of course intimately connected with be and fd statistics ; here is a little table which emphasizes their similarities and differences ( i shall have more to say about the last entry presently ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let me also remind you that brst uses lorentz scalar and vector a - numbers ( pairs for ghosts and @xmath3 ) but that susy uses lorentz spinors .",
    "brst is good for proving renormalizability and gauge invariance of gauge models ; there is no violation of the spin - statistics theorem for physical fields because asymptotic states are ghost - free . on the other side",
    ", susy also conforms to spin - statistics but uses _ all _ states in the asymptotic limit . despite susy",
    "s great allure , its applicability has turned out to be problematic : nature ( even the lhc ) shows no signs of supersymmetric partner particles or states ( photinos , squarks , gravitino , .. ) and this has proved a great disappointment to me and to many others .",
    "it is worth recapitulating the main theoretical attractions of susy:-    * consistent nontrivial higher group incorporating poincare : @xmath4 , * unifies bosons and fermions , * cancellation of @xmath5s between boson and fermion loops , better renormalizability , * allows supersymmetric generalization of gravity ( sugra ) , * its extension allows ` internal symmetries ' to be incorporated via generators @xmath6 , * can be generalized to string / brane theory .",
    "these are the reasons why so many physicists have persisted with investigating susy , regardless and sometimes oblivious of experiment .",
    "the most significant aspect of susy is that fermions and bosons act ` oppositely ' to one another . since @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dirac operator",
    ", we can construe @xmath9-coordinates as adding to dimension and @xmath2-coordinates as subtracting dimension .",
    "this is also confirmed by group theory associated with @xmath10 and @xmath11 where an alteration in sign of @xmath12 allows one to continue casimirs and dimensions of certain classes of representation from one lie algebra to the other @xcite .    _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` _ _ the lord giveth and the lord taketh away _ _ '' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it does not really matter if the @xmath2-numbers are spinorial or scalar and i would like to take advantage of that fact . by matching @xmath9-coordinates with @xmath2-coordinates ( and",
    "likewise be fields with fd fields ) we get may end up with _ zero _",
    "nett dimensions (= # dimensions of universe before the big bang ? ) .",
    "therefore to the four @xmath13 of space - time i will add four @xmath14  or equivalently add five @xmath14 , but only take half the states to get the statistics correct .",
    "i shall associate these lorentz scalar @xmath2-nos . with ` property ' or ` attribute ' , leading to natural internal symmetries between these coordinates .",
    "to obtain a sensible fundamental particle spectrum i have found it necessary to make the following charge @xmath15 and fermion number @xmath16 assignments:- @xmath17 the @xmath18 coordinates have been labelled from 0 to 4 .",
    "crudely we can regard    * label 0 as ` neutrinicity ' * labels 1 - 3 as ( antidown ) ` chromicity ' * label 4 as ` electricity '    other properties are to be considered composites of these and it helps to regard such attributes as the ingredients of a recipe .",
    "as you will recall , rabi was heard to say `` who ordered that ? '' when the muon was discovered .",
    "well , in our scheme the muon , tauon and more generally particle families are an integral part of the menu .    from these extended coordinates , superfields ( functions of space - time and property )",
    "may be constructed @xcite . since the product of two @xmath2-nos",
    "is a ( nilpotent ) @xmath9-no .",
    ", a bose superfield @xmath19 should be a taylor series in even powers of @xmath20 and a fermi superfield @xmath21 a series in odd powers of @xmath20  up to the 5th : @xmath22 @xmath23 when forming actions as products of superfields we should integrate over all spacetime as well as property to cover all possibilities and attribute changes .",
    "the above expansions produce too many states , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , viz .",
    "256 , so they need cutting down .",
    "( had we only used four @xmath18 we would not have been able to accommodate three generations as a matter of fact . ) now a primary way to halve the number of states essentially is to impose self - conjugation whereby @xmath26 corresponding to reflection along the main diagonal in an @xmath27 magic square .",
    "secondarily impose ( anti ) self - duality corresponding to reflection about the cross diagonal , specifically @xmath28 noting that the dual ( @xmath29 ) of a field term has exactly the same @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the field .",
    "for example , @xmath30 apart from diminution of components through antiduality , we are able to exorcize some unpleasant attribute combinations .",
    "thus @xmath31 and @xmath32 are self - dual , so imposing antiduality eliminates these nasties , since they have @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "if we place these states in a kind of chessboard of dimensions @xmath35 , the fermions fall in the black squares and bosons in the white squares .",
    "the thing to note is that this scheme contains all known quarks and leptons , with indications of a fourth generation .",
    "there are significant differences with the standard model however;-    * there are more than 3 leptons / d - quarks .",
    "these must necessarily be heavy .",
    "* the first and second generations are electroweak doublets , but the third generation is a triplet ! specifically ( @xmath36 which run from one to three are color labels below ) , @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 * the ckm matrix will not be exactly unitary due to @xmath40 ( charge -4/3 ) ; the best place to search for an @xmath40 is presumably in electron - positron annihilation .    the mass matrix which affects quarks as well as leptons is due to a set of chargeless higgs @xmath19 field s expectation values ; there are nine possibilities having @xmath41 but associated with only one su(5 ) invariant yukawa coupling:-    * one @xmath42 , * one @xmath43 ( standard higgs doublet expectation value ) , * three @xmath44 * four @xmath45    others being related by duality .",
    "this scheme is therefore more constrained than the standard model .",
    "all this is by way of entree .",
    "i wish to offer the main course now .",
    "you must be wondering where the gauge fields reside in such a scheme ?",
    "it has probably already occurred to you that one may mimic susy and supergauge the massless free action for @xmath46 , but without added complication of spin . and",
    "indeed one can : in the time - honoured way , using the substitution rule for covariant derivatives whereby the generators of internal symmetry or shape - shifting property transformations are given by @xmath47 but there is a more compelling way , which is fully geometrical and has the benefit of incorporating gravity !",
    "we will construct a fermionic version of kaluza - klein ( kk ) theory , this time without needing to handle infinite modes which arise from compressed normal bosonic coordinates .",
    "these are the significant points about the enlarged metric involving the extended coordinate @xmath48:-    * one must introduce a fundamental length @xmath49 for the enlarged @xmath50 , because property @xmath51 has no dimensions ; this is tied to the gravity scale @xmath52 ; * gravity ( plus gauge field products ) fall within the @xmath53 sector , gauge fields in @xmath54 and the higgs scalars must form a matrix in @xmath55 ; * the maximal gauge group is connected with the number of @xmath18 , so this is su(5 ) in our scheme , ( _ although nature seems only to gauge the standard subgroup for some unknown reason _ ) ; * gauge transformations are property rotations , dependent on space - time ; * there is no place for a gravitino as spin is absent ( @xmath18 are lorentz scalar ) , ; * there are necessarily a small _ finite _ number of modes .    to carry out this programme i need to introduce some basic notational niceties first @xcite . with the extended coordinate @xmath56 ,",
    "let @xmath57 ( roman ) correspond to space - time @xmath58 and let @xmath59 ( greek ) correspond to property @xmath60 .",
    "set [ @xmath61=0 ( no grading ) and [ @xmath62=1 ( grading ) .",
    "thus @xmath63[n ] } a^n v^m$ ] .",
    "now we can revisit general relativity _ taking great care with ordering and sign factors _ !",
    "our rule is always to take left derivatives , like @xmath64 but we have to reconcile this with traditional gr notation , @xmath65 , which is ingrained but _ back to front _ !",
    "this introduces sign factors and we have to live with that .",
