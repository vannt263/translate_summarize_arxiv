    "mutual information @xmath30 measures the part of entropy corresponding to the concurrent knowledge of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "intuitively , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 have redundant role knowing one parameter will not reduce uncertainty about @xmath14 as it will be reproduced by uncertainty in the remaining parameter .",

    "the redundancy has also a dual interpretation .",
    "the reduction in uncertainty of @xmath20 gained by observing data @xmath14 decreases the entropies of @xmath26 and @xmath27 to a degree dependent on their redundancy level measured by @xmath30 .",

    "+ evaluation of @xmath31 in a general setting it is computationally prohibitively expensive for most models of realistic size ( see si for details ) .",
    "we show , however , how to evaluate @xmath31 efficiently in two relevant scenarios . in the first one , we assume that guesses about true parameter values are available , in the second that experimental data can be used to generate posterior distribution",
    ". denote available parameter guesses as @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the posterior distribution can be approximated using the bayesian asymptotic theory @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fisher information matrix of the model @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the number of replicates of @xmath14 considered in the above posterior .",

    "we found a straightforward and numerically stable method to evaluation mutual information @xmath37 where @xmath38 are canonical correlations extracted from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a minimum of lengths of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see si for derivation ) .",
    "canonical correlations are defined as the maximal correlation between mutually orthogonal linear combinations of parameters of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see si ) .",
    "therefore we can easily quantify functional redundancy if fi can be computed .",

    "_ being able to evaluate @xmath44 we can represent redundancy structure for a given model using statistical clustering tools . among a number of clustering approaches @xcite we chose the hierarchical clustering , which is more appropriate to represent correlation structure with assignment to clusters having a secondary importance ( see si for details ) . in order to built an intuition",

    "both mrna and protein molecules are degraded at rates @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",

    "parameters pairs @xmath52 and @xmath53 are only partially redundant as the ratio @xmath54 has identical impact on protein level as the ratio @xmath55 and the latter does not impact mrna level .",

    "parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are first linked reciprocally at 0 hight and both pairs are linked together at non - zero high .",
    "we plot the linkages at height @xmath58 , ( where @xmath40 is a size of a smaller cluster ) compared to the maximum of sons height .",

    "the model considered here , proposed in @xcite and further developed in @xcite represents activation of nf-@xmath0b induced genes in response to stimulation by tnf-@xmath79 ( the pro - inflammatory cytokine ) .",

    "module by module compensation is less efficient i.e. correlation ( mutual information ) between clusters is smaller than between parameters within the clusters . + as a second scenario we consider the behaviour of the system , @xmath14 , to be defined entirely by the normalised nuclear concentration of the nf-@xmath0b with measurement error .",
    "the corresponding dendrogram is presented in figure 1a of si .",

    "below we also show that redundancy structure is stimulus / experiment specific .",

    "the existing definitions together with our approach motivate to define identifiability in terms of redundancy .",
    "we introduce definition of ( @xmath93 , @xmath94)-identifiably .",
    "we say that an element @xmath95 of the vector @xmath96 is ( @xmath93,@xmath94)-identifiable if @xmath97 ( equivalently @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 ( see si ) , where @xmath100 denotes all elements of the vector @xmath20 except @xmath95 .",
