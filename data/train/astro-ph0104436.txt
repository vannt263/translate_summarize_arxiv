    "the elliptical galaxy maffei 1 ( maffei 1968 ) is one of the dominant members of a group that includes the spiral galaxy ic 342 ( van den bergh 1971 ) .",
    "this group of galaxies contains some of the largest extragalactic objects in the northern sky ( buta & mccall 1999 ) , indicating that maffei 1 and its companions are relatively close .",
    "in fact , with the possible exception of ngc 5128 , which has a distance of 3.9 mpc ( harris , harris , & poole 1999 ) , maffei 1 may be the nearest giant elliptical galaxy and , despite being located at low galactic latitudes , is thus an important benchmark for studies of these systems .",
    "moreover , if maffei 1 is as close as 2 mpc ( buta & mccall 1983 ) , then it could significantly affect the dynamics of the local group , which could then no longer be considered as a simple two - body system ( valtonen et al .",
    "1993 ; zheng , valtonen , & byrd 1991 ) .",
    "this has potential cosmological implications , as local group timing arguments provide a direct geometrical constraint on the mass of the galaxy and m31 ( e.g. kahn & woltjer 1959 ) and , by extension , the dark matter content of galaxies .",
    "buta & mccall ( 1999 ) list radial velocities for 13 members of the ic 342/maffei group , and the mean is @xmath6 km sec@xmath7 with a dispersion @xmath8 km sec@xmath7 .",
    "using equation 6 of courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) , the mean velocity of this group relative to the local group center is then @xmath9 km sec@xmath7 , which significantly exceeds the velocity dispersion of the local group ( @xmath10 km sec@xmath7 ; courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the radial velocity of the ic 342/maffei group is consistent with these objects being well outside the local group .",
    "however , there is a sizeable spread in the distances that have been estimated for maffei 1 and its companions . using the faber - jackson relation ,",
    "buta & mccall ( 1983 ) concluded that the distance to maffei 1 is @xmath11 mpc .",
    "more recently , luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) obtained a distance of 4.2 @xmath12 mpc using surface brightness flucuations in @xmath13 , and @xmath14 mpc based on the d@xmath15 relation .",
    "the distances to other members of the ic 342/maffei group have been estimated by mccall ( 1989 ) , krismer , tully , & gioia ( 1995 ) , karachentsev et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ivanov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the results fall between 1.7 and 5.3 mpc . while this large range in distances may call into question the reality of an ic 342/maffei group , many of the distance estimates have large uncertainties , due in part to the significant amount of reddening towards these objects .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion of the ic 342/maffei group deduced from the buta & mccall ( 1999 ) data , quoted in the opening sentence of this paragraph , is not significantly different from that of the local group derived by courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) , and this would likely not be the case if the galaxies were spread out over 3.5 mpc .",
    "the large range of distances measured , and inferred , for maffei 1 and its companions underscores the need to obtain additional distance estimates .",
    "direct constraints on the distance to maffei 1 can be obtained from the photometric properties of resolved stars in this galaxy .",
    "a complicating factor is that maffei 1 is viewed at low galactic latitudes , and efforts to probe the stellar content of this galaxy must deal with contamination from stars in the galactic disk and extinction by interstellar dust .",
    "the extinction towards maffei 1 is considerable , with a@xmath16 mag ( buta & mccall 1983 ) , and so efforts to study the resolved stellar content of this galaxy are restricted to the infrared .",
    "if the distance to maffei 1 is not greater than 10 mpc , and this galaxy has an agb content similar to that in the bulge of m31 , which peaks at @xmath17 ( davidge 2001a ) , then the brightest stars should be detectable in the near - infrared using a 4 meter telescope equipped with an adaptive optics ( ao ) system . in the current paper",
    ", we discuss a preliminary reconnaisance of the stellar content of a field 6 arcmin from the center of maffei 1 using deep @xmath0 and @xmath1 images with angular resolutions approaching the diffraction limit of the 3.6 metre canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the data were recorded with the cfht ao bonette ( rigaut et al .",
    "1998 ) and kir imager during the nights of ut 2000 september 10 and 11 .",
    "kir contains a @xmath18 hg : cd : te array with 0.034 arcsec pixels , and thus images a @xmath19 arcsec field .",
    "two fields were observed through @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) filters .",
    "one field , centered on the ao reference star gsc 03699 - 00675 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 j2000 ) samples maffei 1 at a projected distance of 6 arcmin from the galaxy center .",
    "this field was selected based on ( 1 ) the surface brightness of maffei 1 , which the measurements given by buta & mccall ( 1999 ) suggested was sufficiently low at this galactocentric radius to permit individual stars on the upper magnitude of the rgb to be resolved with the ao system during median seeing conditions , and ( 2 ) the availablity of an ao reference star .",
    "this field will be referred to as the ` galaxy ' field for the remainder of the paper .",
    "the second field , which will be referred to as the ` background ' field , is located 25 arcmin from maffei 1 , and is centered on the ao reference star gsc 03699 - 01721 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 j2000 ) .",
    "the data were obtained in sets of five 60 sec exposures , which were recorded at each corner of a @xmath24 arcsec square dither pattern .",
    "the dither sequence was repeated to increase signal from faint sources .",
    "the total exposure time for the galaxy field was 160 minutes per filter , while for the background field the total exposure time was 60 minutes per filter .",
    "the data were reduced using the procedures discussed by davidge & courteau ( 1999 ) , and the final images have fwhm = 0.14 arcsec ( @xmath0 ) and 0.15 arcsec ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the brightnesses of individual stars were measured with the point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , and the instrumental measurements were transformed into the standard system using coefficients derived from observations of faint ukirt standard stars ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) . a single psf was constructed for each image using tasks in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) ; while anisoplanicity causes the psf to vary with distance from the guide star , past experience with the cfht ao system indicates that these variations do not dominate the uncertainties in the photometry over the kir field ( davidge & courteau 1999 ; davidge 2001b ) .",
    "speckle noise hinders the detection of faint sources near the relatively bright ao guide stars ( racine et al .",
    "1999 ) , and so the area within 3 arcsec of the guide star in each field was excluded from the photometric analysis .",
    "artificial star experiments were used to estimate completeness and assess systematic effects in the photometry .",
    "artificial stars with @xmath25 colors similar to those of detected objects , and in numbers small enough to prevent artificially increasing the degree of crowding , were added to the images of each field .",
    "photometry of the artificial stars indicate that ( 1 ) systematic errors in the measured brightnesses exceed 0.1 mag when @xmath26 , and ( 2 ) the completeness fractions in the galaxy and background fields are similar when @xmath27 ; hence , @xmath28 is adopted as the faint limit for these data .",
    "while the galaxy field might be expected to go slightly deeper than the background field because of the difference in integration times , this is not the case because of the greater degree of crowding among faint objects in the galaxy field .",
    "massive elliptical galaxies have sizeable , centrally - concentrated globular cluster populations .",
    "buta & mccall ( private communication ) have detected resolved objects in wfpc2 images centered on the core of maffei 1 , and they suggest that these are globular clusters . we have not detected similar objects in our galaxy field ; this null detection is perhaps not surprising given ( 1 ) the modest field size , and ( 2 ) that we observed the outer regions of the galaxy , where the density of clusters is low .    the @xmath29 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the galaxy and background fields are compared in figure 1 .",
    "main sequence stars in the galactic disk form a locus with @xmath25 between 0 and 0.4 that dominates the bright portions of both cmds .",
    "the main sequence locus has similar colors in both fields , indicating that the reddenings along the two sight lines are not vastly different .",
    "the @xmath29 cmd of the galaxy field contains a population of red objects with @xmath30 that is not seen in the background field .",
    "the statistical significance of these faint stars can be investigated by comparing the @xmath13 luminosity functions ( lfs ) of the galaxy and background fields , and this is done in figure 2 .",
    "the lfs in this figure were constructed from sources detected in both filters .",
    "the lfs of both fields show qualitatively similar behaviour at the bright end , rising slowly from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ; however , at @xmath33 the lf of the galaxy field departs from this trend .",
    "the difference between the lfs of the galaxy and background fields shows an excess at @xmath33 that is significant at the @xmath34 level ; at fainter levels the statistical significance of the excess population becomes even greater .",
    "it is evident from figure 1 that the galaxy field contains more galactic disk stars than the background field , and the ratio of objects with @xmath13 between 15 and 20 in these fields is @xmath35 ; this difference could be due to stochastic variations in star counts , clustering , and/or differential absorption . to investigate the extent to which the difference in foreground star counts affects the statistical significance of any faint population in the galaxy field , the background field lf",
    "was scaled up by a factor of 1.9 , and the difference between the galaxy field and scaled background field lfs is shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 .",
    "even after scaling the background field lf , the galaxy field lf still contains an excess number of objects when @xmath30 , indicating that the faint population detected in the galaxy field is not an artifact of field - to - field variations in foreground star counts .",
    "we thus conclude that the faint stars seen in the galaxy field belong to maffei 1 .",
    "the distance to maffei 1 can be estimated to an internal accuracy of @xmath36 mag based on the star counts in the galaxy field . to demonstrate this ,",
    "assume a@xmath37 ( buta & mccall 1983 ) and a preliminary distance of 4.2 mpc ( luppino & tonry 1993 ) .",
    "since the surface brightness of maffei 1 in the galaxy field is @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath39 based on the buta & mccall ( 1999 ) light profile , the total integrated brightness in this field is m@xmath40 .",
    "davidge ( 2001a ) discusses observations of a field in the bulge of m31 with almost the same integrated intrinsic brightness as the maffei 1 galaxy field , and found 4 stars within 0.5 mag of the agb - tip .",
    "the number density of stars climbs rapidly with decreasing brightness in the m31 bulge field , and there are 58 stars in the next 0.5 mag interval",
    ". if the stellar content of the maffei 1 galaxy field is like that in the m31 bulge then ( 1 ) the number of stars within 0.5 mag of the agb - tip will be modest , to the point where they may not be detectable above the statistical noise in the background counts , and ( 2 ) there will be a rapid increase in the stellar density in the next 0.5 mag interval .",
    "thus , while it might be straight - forward to detect an agb component given the steeply rising lf within 1 mag in @xmath13 of the agb - tip , small number statistics in the top 0.5 mag mean that the agb - tip can likely not be identified to better than @xmath36 mag in fields at moderately large distances from the galaxy center .",
    "after correcting for incompleteness and subtracting background star counts , we find that there are @xmath41 stars with @xmath13 between 20.25 and 20.75 in the galaxy field , suggesting that this brightness interval samples the agb roughly 0.5 mag below the agb - tip .",
    "we thus consider @xmath42 ( i.e. the bright edge of the @xmath33 bin ) to be the faint limit of the agb - tip in maffei 1 , while the agb - tip will likely not be brighter than @xmath43 ; hence , we adopt @xmath44 as the brightness of the agb - tip .",
    "davidge ( 2001a ) finds that the brightest stars in m32 , the bulge of m31 , and the galactic bulge have similar infrared brightnesses , with m@xmath45 , suggesting that the agb - tip can be used as a standard candle to estimate the distance to maffei 1 .",
    "we estimate the distance to maffei 1 in a differential manner with respect to m31 .",
    "the brightest stars in the bulge of m31 have @xmath17 and so the difference in distance modulus between this galaxy and maffei 1 is @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 for m31 ( van den bergh 2000 ) , a@xmath48 for maffei 1 ( buta & mccall 1983 ) , and @xmath49 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) , then the unreddened distance modulus of maffei 1 is @xmath3 , which is in good agreement with the luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) surface brightness flucuation result ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the stars that dominate surface brightness flucuations in the infrared have m@xmath51 ( luppino & tonry 1993 ) ; not only are these stars significantly fainter than the agb stars detected in the current study , but they are also likely evolving on the first ascent giant branch .",
    "thus , the distances estimated here and by luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) rely on very different stars , and are in this sense independent .",
    "the rgb - tip , which occurs @xmath52 mag in @xmath13 below the agb - tip in nearby galaxies ( e.g. davidge 2000 ) , provides another means of estimating the distance to maffei 1 .",
    "the results in the current study suggest that the rgb - tip in maffei 1 should appear near @xmath53 , which is within the detection threshold of 8 metre class telescopes equipped with ao systems . in any event",
    ", if maffei 1 were as close as 2 mpc then the rgb - tip would occur at @xmath32 , and this is clearly inconsistent with the data presented here ; maffei 1 is therefore too distant to significantly affect the dynamics of the local group .",
    "we close by noting that our distance to maffei 1 is consistent with a smooth local hubble flow just outside the local group ( sandage 1986 , ekholm et al .",
    "2001 ) . assuming a smooth hubble flow with h@xmath54 km sec@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( freedman et al .",
    "2000 ) and a recession velocity of @xmath55 km sec@xmath7 (  1 ) for the ic 342/maffei group yields a distance of @xmath56 mpc , which is in excellent agreement with the distance of @xmath5 mpc derived for maffei 1 from agb stars ."
