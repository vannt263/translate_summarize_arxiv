    "cassiopeia  a ( cas  a ; 3c 461 , g111.7 - 2.1 ) is the 2nd - youngest - known supernova remnant ( snr ) and , at a distance of 3.4 kpc @xcite , it lies just beyond the perseus arm of the galaxy . with",
    "the discovery of light echoes from the explosion , we now know that cas  a resulted from a type iib explosion @xcite .",
    "cas  a is one of the strongest synchrotron radio - emitting objects in the sky and has been observed extensively with the very large array ( vla ) since its commissioning in 1980 .",
    "the morphology of cas  a is quite complex with structure distributed over a variety of spatial scales .",
    "the terminology used to describe some of these structures was coined in some of the earliest papers describing the optical and resolved radio images @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature is the almost circular `` bright ring '' at a radius of @xmath5 which is generally regarded as marking the location of ejecta that have interacted with the reverse shock ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a fainter `` plateau '' of radio emission is seen out to a radius of @xmath6 . to the northeast , where the shell becomes broken , is the `` jet '' and extending in the opposite direction to the southwest is the counter - jet .",
    "the jet and counter - jet do not represent outflow in the classical sense .",
    "instead they describe locations where the fastest - moving ejecta are observed well beyond the plateau and farthest from the explosion center ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to the southeast , iron - rich ejecta extend beyond the bright ring and into the plateau .",
    "the jets and extended iron - rich structure are likely the result of an asymmetric explosion of the progenitor ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the light echo data also indicate an asymmetric explosion @xcite .",
    "in addition to the shocked ejecta described above , there is a class of ejecta still interior to the reverse shock in cas  a. these `` unshocked ejecta '' were discovered via absorption of low frequency ( @xmath0100  mhz ) radio emission @xcite and are also seen to radiate in the infrared in the emission lines of [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] @xcite .",
    "the term `` unshocked '' is somewhat of a misnomer because all of the ejecta were originally shocked by the passage of the blast wave through the star .",
    "however , the ejecta cooled during the subsequent expansion of the snr",
    ". what we consider to be shocked ejecta today are those ejecta that have crossed through the reverse shock with the term `` unshocked ejecta '' referring to those ejecta that are still interior to the reverse shock .",
    "thus the simple cartoon of cas  a s structure is that of cold ejecta in the interior of a roughly spherical shell composed of shocked gas that radiates strongly in multiple bands . at low frequencies ,",
    "the radio emission from the far side of the shocked shell is absorbed by the cold , unshocked ejecta in the interior . in ",
    "[ sec : geometry ] we provide a more thorough description of the geometry assumed for our analysis .",
    "the infrared emission from the unshocked ejecta in cas  a occurs because they have been photoionized .",
    "an analysis of the unshocked ejecta observed in the supernova remnant sn1006 , based on calculations of photoionization cross - sections and bethe parameters , showed that the unshocked ejecta are photoionized by two primary sources @xcite .",
    "ambient ultraviolet starlight is all that is necessary to photoionize and since their ionization potentials are below the lyman limit . for ions with ionization potentials above the lyman limit , the ultraviolet and soft x - ray radiation field of the shocked ejecta in sn1006 is such that species up to ( 54.9  ev ) , ( 45.1  ev ) , and ( 54.8  ev ) can be photoionized .",
    "a similar analysis was performed for cas  a assuming photoionization equilibrium , abundances appropriate for a core - collapse snr , a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for the shocked ejecta , and utilizing a simple one - dimensional hydrodynamic model to follow cas  a s evolution @xcite .",
    "this simplified model predicts that [ ] ( 34.8 ) and [ ] ( 25.9 ) should be the dominant infrared lines in the unshocked ejecta , directly in line with observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite predicts strong [ ] ( 88.4 ) , which we will show in  [ sec : composition ] is present in spectra from the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso _ , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "cas  a was spectrally mapped with the _ spitzer _ space telescope and doppler shifts were measured which allowed a 3d mapping of the ejecta distribution , including the unshocked component @xcite .",
    "we now know based on the _ spitzer _ data that the ejecta are organized into a `` thick disk '' structure , tilted at @xmath7 from the line - of - sight , providing further evidence that the explosion , or subsequent evolution of the snr prior to the reverse shock encounter , must have been asymmetric .",
    "an upper limit of 100  @xmath8 was determined for the electron density of the unshocked ejecta based on infrared [ ] line ratios , but the actual density is likely much lower @xcite .",
    "the absorption seen in the low frequency radio observations provides a means to probe the density and mass of the unshocked ejecta because the free - free optical depth ( @xmath9 ) is related to emission measure and thus density .",
    "@xcite attempted to determine the total mass of the unshocked ejecta , but due to using a @xmath9 appropriate for a hydrogenic gas and a temperature that was too high , arrived at 19m@xmath3 , which is unreasonably large considering that the total ejecta mass is likely only 2 - 4  m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "given the role that the ejecta play in the evolution of snrs , it is important to provide an accurate census of the total mass present , thus prompting a new look at the low frequency absorption analysis of @xcite .",
    "the upgraded karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) primarily accesses frequencies above 1  ghz through its broadband cassegrain focus systems .",
    "its predecessor , hereafter the `` legacy '' vla , also accessed two relatively narrow bands below 1  ghz through its primary focus systems @xcite . these included the `` p  band '' and `` 4  band '' systems operating at 330  mhz ( 1990 - 2009 ) and 74  mhz ( 1998 - 2009 ) , respectively .",
    "both systems provided sub - arcminute resolution imaging and were widely used over their lifetimes .",
    "these systems were removed during the vla upgrade and have been only recently replaced with a new `` low band '' receiving system @xcite .",
    "the first call for proposals using the 330 mhz band of this new system was issued by nrao in february , 2013 .",
    "the legacy 74  mhz and 330  mhz vla systems achieved their maximum angular resolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the a  configuration ( maximum baseline @xmath436  km ) , respectively .",
    "an 8-antenna prototype of the 74  mhz system was used to observe cas  a @xcite early on , adding to the body of vla work extending from 330  mhz to higher frequencies . as the resolution was still relatively poor compared to shorter wavelengths , nrl and nrao added a 74  mhz feed system to the pie town antenna , utilizing an optical fiber link connecting the innermost very large baseline array ( vlba ) antenna to the legacy vla . with a maximum baseline of 73  km",
    ", this improved the angular resolution at 74  mhz and 330  mhz by a factor of two to approximately 9@xmath1 and 3@xmath1 respectively .",
    "cas  a was thereafter reobserved with the full ( 27-antenna ) 74  mhz and the 330  mhz legacy systems using the pie town link capability in august 2003 .      in this paper",
    ", we report on legacy vla observations in 1997 - 1998 at frequencies of 5  ghz , 1.4  ghz , 330  mhz , and 74  mhz , and on the pie town link , observations at frequencies of 330  mhz and 74  mhz in 2003 .",
    "we use our derived images to determine the degree of free - free absorption present , applying the appropriate formula for when the composition of the gas is not dominated by hydrogen .",
    "finally , we calculate the density and mass of the unshocked ejecta and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "observations were made with the legacy vla in 1997 and 1998 using all four configurations from the most extended a - configuration with a maximum antenna separation of 36.4  km to the most compact d - configuration with a shortest separation of 35  m. these are summarized in table  [ e1table ] .",
    "data were taken at 4410.0 , 4640.0 , 4985.0 , and 5085.0  mhz ( hereafter called 5  ghz or c  band ) , at 1285.0 , 1365.1 , 1464.9 , and 1665.0  mhz ( hereafter called 1.4  ghz or l  band ) , at 327.5 and 333.0  mhz ( hereafter called 330  mhz or p  band ) , and at 73.8  mhz ( hereafter called 74  mhz or 4  band ) . the 5  ghz and",
    "1.4  ghz data were taken in continuum mode with pairs of frequencies observed simultaneously .",
    "the purpose of observing at multiple 5  ghz and 1.4  ghz bands is to improve sensitivity while avoiding bandwidth smearing .",
    "the 330  mhz and 74  mhz data were taken in spectral line mode . note that the d - configuration data taken at 330  mhz and 74  mhz had insufficient resolution to be useful for this paper and were not utilized .    in order to increase the spatial resolution of the lowest frequency images ,",
    "further observations at 74  mhz and 330  mhz were taken with the legacy vla in a - configuration and utilizing the pie town ( pt ) link ( hereafter called a+pt ) .",
    "we were allocated an 18-hour observing block in aug 2003 with 12.2 hours on cas  a and the remainder of the time on calibrators and other sources of interest at low frequencies .",

    "after initial calibration , multiple passes of self - calibration and imaging were performed on the cas  a data to improve the antenna phase and gain solutions .",
    "the observations at 330  mhz and 74  mhz were performed in spectral line mode due to the presence of narrow - band radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "images of cygnus  a at 330  mhz and 74  mhz , after normalization to the @xcite absolute flux density scale , were used for both flux and bandpass calibration .",
    "rfi was flagged out and the data were combined into a single channel at each band .",
    "iterative cycling between self calibration and imaging was then used to improve the phase and gain solutions for cas  a and to derive the final images .    74  mhz legacy vla data , especially for the b , a , and a+pt link configurations , require corrections for ionospheric phase variations that can be rapid and severe over baselines longer than several kilometers @xcite .",

    "the individual configuration data at each band were concatenated and images made with matched beam sizes .",
    "minimum and maximum spatial frequency ( @xmath13-@xmath14 ) ranges were used to match spatial sampling with the exception of the 25 and 185 330-mhz images which have a different minimum @xmath13-@xmath14 cutoff than the other images due to the native minimum @xmath13-@xmath14 distance for the 2003 a+pt data and to avoid the van vleck bias for the 1997 - 1998 data , as discussed below .",
    "the aips maximum - entropy deconvolution routine vtess was used to restore the total intensity images .",
    "the default image for vtess was a 5  ghz image of appropriate spatial resolution . using the same default image in vtess for all of the bands",
    "essentially forces the images to look as much alike as possible , with any resulting differences being due to the requirements of the data .",
    "initial zero - spacing flux guesses were supplied to vtess based on the 5  ghz integrated flux density and cas  a s average spectral index of -0.77 .",
    "the `` negative flux '' option was used so that vtess was not required to get within 5% of the flux estimate . the standard correction for primary beam attenuation",
    "was applied to all of the final images .",
    "since there were four images at 1.4  ghz and four images at 5  ghz , the images for each band needed to be normalized in flux density and averaged together . while we could have concatenated the final calibrated @xmath13-@xmath14 datasets and then performed the imaging , we chose to normalize the images directly .",
    "there are two primary reasons for this choice .",
    "first , the slightly different primary beam correction at each band introduces a small , but not insignificant error .",
    "second , it is generally not a good idea to force the @xmath13-@xmath14 data to the same flux density , and grid on one plane for objects , such as cas  a , that have significant spectral gradients because each @xmath13-@xmath14 cell has a slightly different visibility amplitude at each band . furthermore , since the individual 5  ghz and 1.4  ghz bands are close together , the relative calibration uncertainty is large enough that cas  a s well - known average spectral index can not be used to scale between them .",
    "this necessitates doing the concatenation and normalization in the imaging plane .",
    "we determined the average scaling factor between each set of 5  ghz and 1.4  ghz images using the radial surface brightness profiles extracted from a series of 20  wedges .",
    "the 1.4  ghz images were scaled to the 1.285 ghz image and the 5  ghz images were scaled to the 4.64  ghz image . in table",
    "[ fluxes ] , we summarize the integrated flux densities , noise figures , and @xmath13-@xmath14 ranges for the final images and in figure  [ vvcorr ] we plot the integrated radio spectrum of cas  a. the uncertainty in the integrated flux density at each band is calculated based on a 2% uncertainty in the absolute flux scale of the vla @xcite .    at 330  mhz ,",
    "legacy vla observations of cas  a suffer from the van vleck bias @xcite which depends very strongly and non - linearly on the correlated flux density and also affects phase since the degradation operates independently on the real and imaginary portions of the visibility separately .",
    "thus , short antenna spacings report a reduced flux density which skews the final reconstructed flux density of the image by about 6% as shown in table  [ fluxes ] and figure  [ vvcorr ] .",
    "an effect this large would create a significant bias in spectral index and absorption measurements . for the a+pt 330  mhz data taken in 2003 , the minimum @xmath13-@xmath14 distance is 0.7  k@xmath15 , which is long enough to avoid the van vleck bias . in order to avoid this bias for the 1997 - 1998 330  mhz image , which has data from shorter baselines , we impose a 0.5  k@xmath15 minimum to the @xmath13-@xmath14 range",
    "this limit happens to correspond to the minimum baseline for the 5  ghz data in d - configuration and results in a completely negligible van vleck bias @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , variations in spatial sampling between images can affect spectral index measurements .",
    "different deconvolution methods provide different abilities to `` fill in '' the holes in the @xmath13-@xmath14 sampling .",
    "strict overlap or matching of @xmath13-@xmath14 coverage is not required to get a good image , especially for an exceptionally bright source such as cas  a. furthermore , good deconvolution algorithms are able to recover the short - spacing flux , especially when they permit a total flux estimate and allow a default image , as vtess does .",
    "the van vleck bias also should affect the 1.4  ghz images based on the correlation coefficient @xcite , however we note only a 1% difference in the total flux density when using 0.5  k@xmath15 vs. 0.12  k@xmath15 as the minimum of the @xmath13-@xmath14 range ( 0.12  k@xmath15 corresponds to the minimum baseline for the 1.4  ghz data in d - configuration . )",
    "the 1% flux density difference at 1.4  ghz is small enough that other factors besides the van vleck bias might be accountable .",
    "the integrated spectrum of cas  a plotted in figure  [ vvcorr ] shows that the spectral index ( @xmath16 ) is constant from 5  ghz up to 330  mhz ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) when using a minimum @xmath13-@xmath14 cutoff for the 330  mhz image . from 330  mhz to 74  mhz , the integrated spectrum flattens slightly ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in spectral index are calculated based on a formal propagation of the uncertainty in integrated flux density , and thus the spectral flattening at 74  mhz is statistically significant .",
    "the spectral index between 5  ghz and 330  mhz is the same as that reported by @xcite for epoch 1980 but the spectral index between 330  mhz and 74  mhz is steeper than the 1980 result . @xcite",
    "derived a frequency - dependent secular decrease in flux density which would flatten the spectral index over time .",
    "newer low frequency observations have shown that there is no frequency dependence to the secular decrease and the overall rate is about 8% yr@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the integrated flux densities we report in table  [ fluxes ] at 5  ghz , 1.4  ghz , and 330  mhz are only @xmath43% less than the 1980 values from @xcite and the 74  mhz integrated flux densities are largely consistent with those reported by @xcite .",
    "there is no significant change in integrated flux density between 1997 - 1998 and 2003 .",
    "given the differences in aperture coverage , constraints imposed during image reconstruction , and flux standards applied for the different data sets , as well as the short - term variability observed in cas  a @xcite , our flux densities are in line with expectations .",
    "thus we argue that there is no significant curvature in cas  a s integrated spectrum between 5  ghz and 330  mhz",
    "but there is a significant flattening of the integrated spectrum at lower frequencies .",
    "we did not concatenate the 1997 - 1998 and 2003 data sets in order to make images containing data from both epochs because of two complicating factors .",
    "the first is the non - negligible proper - motion induced shift , due to expansion , across the epochs , and the second are the variations in the brightness of compact features over time .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that two - thirds of the compact radio features in cas  a have brightness changes in the range of -2.2% yr@xmath20 to + 5.2% yr@xmath20 and that the compact features were on average brightening at the rate of 1.6% yr@xmath20 . at low spatial resolution ,",
    "the proper motions and small - scale brightness changes are mitigated , but then there is no reason to combine the a+pt data with the lower resolution data except to improve signal - to - noise , which as we will demonstrate below , was not necessary for the analysis at 185 resolution .    .",

    "a , however , there is a significant flattening of the spectral index between 330  mhz and 74  mhz . given that the spectral flattening is confined to the center of the 74  mhz image , there is likely an absorbing medium in or near cas  a that affects the observed low frequency emission but not the observed high frequency emission .",

    "spitzer _ was the presence of emission from unshocked ejecta in cas  a. this emission is most prominent in the lines of [ ] and [ ] and less prominent for [ ] and [ ] @xcite .",
    "the density and temperature conditions derived for this material based on the infrared line ratios confirms that it is indeed cold , low density , unshocked , photoionized ejecta @xcite . in order to confirm the hypothesis of @xcite that the low frequency free - free absorption seen in cas  a is due to unshocked ejecta",
    ", we compare the @xmath26 image to the infrared [ ] image .",
    "as shown in the top left panel of figure  [ siabs ] , strong free - free absorption ( @xmath29 ) corresponds well to bright [ ] emission ( @xmath30 w m@xmath31 sr@xmath20 ) . however , there are bright [ ] regions that have low or no associated absorption .",
    "+        there is not a one - to - one correlation between free - free absorption and [ ] emission for three primary reasons .",
    "first , while the [ ] image is a good representative of the emission observed from the unshocked ejecta in the _ spitzer _ data , it also contains emission from shocked ejecta . as the ejecta at large radius cross the reverse shock , become heated , and contribute to the bright ring emission , the free - free absorption drops drastically due to the temperature dependence .",
    "we can filter the [ ] image using the infrared [ ] image to blank those regions corresponding to shocked ejecta .",
    "the remaining [ ] emission , shown in the bottom left panel of figure  [ siabs ] , is dominated by unshocked ejecta and , when plotted against @xmath26 ( bottom right panel of figure  [ siabs ] ) , shows a good correlation to the low frequency absorption .",
    "the second reason for scatter in the correlation between the free - free absorption and [ ] emission is that the [ ] image provides no information about other unshocked components that may be present but not detected , such as higher ionization states of si- and o - rich ejecta or the presence of fe - rich ejecta , for example . finally , the @xmath26 image is a function of both the column density of the absorbing medium and the distribution of radio emitting regions along the line of sight .",
    "the presence of clumped radio emission biases the @xmath26 calculation to higher or lower values depending on whether the clump is on the far or near side of the unshocked ejecta in cas  a. the greater the brightness disparity between the clump and the diffuse background , the stronger the bias .",
    "we show this case in the top right panel of figure  [ siabs ] where we plot slice profiles for @xmath26 and 74  mhz and [ ] surface brightnesses .",
    "the peak @xmath26 occurs at the location of a particularly bright emission clump , but has no obvious correlation to any distinct [ ] features .",
    "we therefore conclude that the free - free absorption is clearly correlated to the observed emission from the unshocked ejecta and is a tracer of this material as presumed by @xcite .",
    "since free - free absorption depends on the temperature and density of the absorbing medium , our low frequency radio data provide a means of determining the conditions in the unshocked ejecta . when coupled with assumptions about geometry",
    ", we can also calculate the total mass of the observed unshocked ejecta .",
    "we carry out these calculations in the following sections .",
    "our use of thermal absorption to probe the properties of the unshocked ejecta in cas  a relies on simplifying assumptions .",
    "our measurement of @xmath26 , discussed above , can yield an equivalent free - free optical depth , but relies on our knowledge of the line - of - sight brightness distribution of the nonthermal , illuminating radiation from cas  a s shell .",
    "the high spatial resolution images in figure  [ 2asec ] show that cas  a consists of both clumpy and diffuse components .",
    "we assume the smooth emission has radial symmetry , consistent with shell decomposition models @xcite , so that equal contributions come from the front and back side of the shell along any line of sight . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : clumps ] , the presence of clumps will bias our measurement of @xmath26 .",
    "however , it is almost impossible to avoid clumped emission in cas  a , as figure  [ 2asec ] shows .",
    "we could try using a higher frequency image to account for the clumps , but without a priori information about which clumps are in front of or behind the absorbing medium , we would introduce more uncertainties into the analysis .",
    "therefore , we choose to select a representative absorption figure that effectively averages out the contamination from clumps . in the top right panel of figure  [ siabs ] , we show the absorption profile taken along the slice indicated in the inset .",
    "the peaks and valleys of the central absorption ( @xmath26 ) are correlated with 74  mhz surface brightness variations , as expected .",
    "typical @xmath26 values in the center of cas a range from 0.1 - 0.25 so we choose by eye @xmath26=0.15 as a compromise between high and low absorption towards the center of cas  a. since this is a somewhat arbitrary choice , we will investigate in  [ sec : vary ] how the final mass and density estimates for the unshocked ejecta depend on the value of @xmath26 .",
    "we also assume that the cold ejecta lie only in the interior of cas  a , and therefore only affect the 74  mhz emission from the back side of the shell , again consistent with three - dimensional models @xcite .",

    "one front and one rear .",
    "the two sheets are separated by a much lower density region , where only a little emission is seen .",
    "one might expect unshocked c - rich and fe - rich ejecta at various locations interior to the reverse shock as well based on stratification models of the ejecta @xcite , however these species are not observed from the unshocked ejecta either in the _ spitzer _ irs spectra or the iso lws spectra , which could indicate that they are of lower density than the o - rich or si - rich material , or simply absent @xcite .",
    "a simplified drawing of the geometry involved is shown in figure  [ cartoon ] .",
    "as explained in  [ optdep ] , the emission from shocked material in cas  a can be modeled as a spherically symmetric shell consisting of smooth and clumped components .",
    "the clumpy shocked material may be ejecta , circumstellar material , or filaments associated with the forward or reverse shock .",
    "the unshocked ejecta are confined to two thick sheets in the interior .",
    "the high spectral resolution _ spitzer _",
    "mapping shows that the sheets are composed of thin filaments ( 15 or 0.03 pc thick ) with several filaments along any given line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimate the combined thickness of the front and back sheets to be of order 10@xmath1 which translates to @xmath480.16  pc at the distance to cas  a of 3.4  kpc @xcite .",
    "the sheets intersect the reverse shock at a radius of about 90@xmath1 ( or 1.48  pc ) , so that the total volume of absorbing material is @xmath491.1 pc@xmath50 .",
    "the geometry can be modified further by the use of a clumping factor .",
    "we know from the optical images of shocked ejecta in cas  a that there is a great deal of structure on small scales with typical knot sizes between 02 and 04 @xcite .",
    "it is not known how much of this clumping was present prior to reverse shock passage .",
    "the effect of clumping is to reduce the total volume of material while at the same time increasing the density of the material . in order to determine the effect of clumping on our calculations",
    ", we simply modify each of our radius or thickness measures by the clumping factor ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) so that when @xmath53 there is no clumping and when @xmath54 there is some degree of clumping .",
    "our default value of @xmath55 is to assume no further clumping beyond the filamentary structures identified by @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the density is constant , then emission measure defined in equation  [ emden ] simplifies to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the combined thickness of the unshocked ejecta sheets . in appendix",
    "c we show electron density fully parameterized in terms of @xmath9 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath40 , @xmath39 , @xmath55 , and @xmath57 , however the variables in the denominator are suppressed by both a natural logarithm and a square root .",
    "therefore we show here a simplified version of the parameterized formula in order to show how electron density depends on these various quantities : @xmath58 thus , our estimate of electron density in the unshocked ejecta is 4.2  @xmath2 .",
    "the total mass of unshocked ejecta is simply @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mass density of the ions , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is proton mass .",
    "if we substitute equation  [ nefull ] for @xmath44 , assume the two thick sheet geometry , and parameterize mass in terms of @xmath9 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath40 , @xmath39 , @xmath55 , @xmath63 , and @xmath57 then , as shown in appendix  c , the dependence on @xmath37 becomes minuscule as the only surviving @xmath37-term is mitigated by the natural logarithm and square root in the denominator . as we did for electron density , we show here a simplified parameterized equation for the total mass of the unshocked ejecta expressed in solar masses : @xmath64 we therefore estimate a total mass in unshocked ejecta of 0.39  m@xmath3 which is significantly improved compared to the 19  m@xmath3 estimated by @xcite .",
    "we now delve into the effect our choices of @xmath26 , @xmath55 , @xmath40 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 , and geometry have on the final electron density and mass estimates .",
    "we start with our measurement of @xmath26 since the values are constrained by the radio observations . in figure  [ vardac ]",
    "we plot equations  [ nefull ] and [ mfull ] as functions of @xmath26 ( via @xmath32 ) .",
    "if @xmath26 is varied from 0.1 to 0.3 , typical of the @xmath26 values found near the middle of cas  a , the electron density and mass estimates change by a factor of two ( 3.3 to 6.6 @xmath2 and 0.31 to 0.62 m@xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "even if `` very strong '' absorption ( @xmath26=0.4 ) were observed uniformly across the center of cas  a , the maximum mass estimate would still be below 1  m@xmath3 .    also shown in figure  [ vardac ] are equations  [ nefull ] and [ mfull ] plotted as functions of clumping . recall that @xmath53 indicates no clumping , while smaller values of @xmath55 increase the amount of clumping in the ejecta .",
    "as clumping increases , the electron density increases and the total mass estimate decreases . for all modest clumping estimates , the electron density remains below 10 @xmath2 and the total mass remains below 1  m@xmath3 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 , @xmath38 , and @xmath37 depend on emission models and observations that may be affected by components that are missing because we have no probe for them , such as higher ionization states of si @xcite . to illustrate the effect of varying these quantities , we plot equations  [ nefull ] and [ mfull ] in figure  [ variables ] .",
    "for each of the plotted curves , two of the values are held constant as indicated .",
    "all reasonable estimates of @xmath40 , @xmath38 , and @xmath37 require that the electron density be less than 10  @xmath2 .",
    "while the total unshocked ejecta mass is much more strongly influenced by temperature and electron / ion ratio than atomic number , plausible variations in all three variables constrain the mass below 1  m@xmath3 .",
    "the final effect we would like to address is that of the geometry . while the two thick sheet geometry for the unshocked ejecta is supported by the morphology of the infrared [ ] and [ ] emission , and the correlation between the @xmath26 map and [ ] is quite good , this is not a one - to - one correlation .",
    "other species possibly in different locations along the line - of - sight might be responsible for some of the observed thermal absorption .",
    "therefore , we consider here a spherical geometry in which the unshocked ejecta are modeled as a filled sphere of absorbing material interior to the bright radio - emitting ring . since the emission measure derives from the @xmath26 measurement , it does not change , however the path length through the absorbing medium does .",
    "if we use @xmath65  pc through the center of cas  a so that @xmath66  pc as before , and we assume that @xmath44 is constant , then the electron density from equations  [ neapprox ] and [ nefull ] becomes 0.98 @xmath2 and the total mass of the unshocked ejecta becomes 1.12  m@xmath3 as derived in equation  [ msph ] .",
    "a clumping factor would increase the electron density and decrease the total mass estimate .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xcite estimated a total mass of 19  m@xmath3 for the unshocked ejecta .",
    "the dominant reason for this high mass value is that the free - free optical depth equation used by @xcite was for a hydrogenic gas , rather than an oxygenic gas , as appropriate for a core - collapse snr .",
    "in addition , @xcite made a number of assumptions about other model parameters that significantly affected their final mass values .",
    "specifically , their temperature was 1000  k compared to our value of 300  k. they used their maximum @xmath26 of 0.3 compared to our more modest estimate of 0.15 .",
    "they correctly assumed the ejecta were dominated by oxygen , but incorrectly assumed that the oxygen was singly ionized .",
    "@xcite also assumed a spherical ejecta distribution rather than our two - thick - sheet morphology .",
    "thus , the confluence of parameter values chosen , and using an incorrect formula for free - free optical depth , resulted in a very high mass estimate in the earlier work .",
    "the density and temperature conditions in the unshocked ejecta and the total mass of this material play a key role in many aspects of supernova remnant physics . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have incorporated results from their analysis of the million - second observation of cas  a with _ chandra _ into hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnant evolution that account for factors such as expansion into a stellar wind and acceleration of the reverse shock .",
    "their models , designed to match the dynamics of cas  a , result in a range of total and shocked ejecta masses , which are then partitioned into the various elemental species based on their derived abundances from the x - ray data .",
    "their most recent prediction for the total mass of ejecta that are currently unshocked is 0.18 - 0.3  m@xmath3 , depending on the model chosen .",
    "which species dominate the composition of the unshocked ejecta is debatable since the explosion is known to have been asymmetric @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that there is little fe left in the unshocked ejecta based on several factors including the lack of infrared fe emission from the unshocked ejecta @xcite , the location of the x - ray - emitting fe - rich ejecta at the same or larger radius than the si - rich ejecta @xcite and the carbon atmosphere of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "our estimate of 0.39  m@xmath3 for the unshocked ejecta is near the upper limit predicted by @xcite , however reasonable variations of our parameters , such as increasing the clumping factor , can lead to lower values of total unshocked ejecta mass in line with the prediction .",
    "we can also compare the density of the unshocked ejecta to the hydrodynamic model of @xcite .",
    "their ejecta model assumes a uniform density core surrounded by a power - law envelope .",
    "the density of the core as a function of time is given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total mass of the ejecta and the factor @xmath69 gives the fraction of the ejecta mass in the core @xcite .",

    "for @xmath75 @xmath2 , @xmath38=2.5 , and @xmath37=8.34 , we derive @xmath76 g @xmath2 , which is only a factor of 5 larger than @xcite .",
    "the ejecta in cas  a are distributed in a complex fashion and the unshocked ejecta show signs of filamentary behavior in the high spectral resolution _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "for any given emission measure , if the material is tied up in clumps , the final density estimate will be higher and the final mass estimate would be lower than when the material is distributed uniformly along the line - of - sight . in order to match our mass estimate with that of @xcite , this would argue for the unshocked ejecta being primarily distributed in the two - shell geometry .",
    "any unshocked c - rich or fe - rich ejecta must then be of such low density that it makes little contribution to the observed thermal absorption  or one or both of these components are missing entirely .",

    "expectations for the density of the unshocked ejecta are not clear . while hydrodynamic models can predict an average density , as in equation  [ meanrho ] , the clumping of the ejecta renders the average somewhat meaningless .",

    "there is the possibility that the fe is tied up in higher ionization states @xcite , but then the lack of and absorption from the unshocked ejecta is puzzling @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that some of the unshocked ejecta in sn1006 are still unaccounted for .    in cas",

    "the question is are the unshocked ejecta in type ia snrs systematically less dense than in core - collapse remnants ?",
    "the extension of low frequency radio analysis to other snrs could be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , since the absorption is frequency dependent , working at frequencies lower than 74  mhz will allow the detection of lower density ejecta in cas  a and other snrs .",
    "@xcite revisited the low frequency , integrated spectrum of cas  a utilizing legacy vla and long wavelength development array 74 mhz measurements .",
    "we consider here how the thermal absorption discussed in this paper relates to the turnover in the integrated spectrum of cas  a at much lower frequencies , as originally documented by @xcite .",
    "given the current limited angular resolution of observations towards cas  a below 74  mhz , our discussion is necessarily limited .",
    "examination of the @xcite figure  1a indicates the integrated spectrum of cas  a begins to turn over below 38  mhz . the @xcite modeled spectrum ( epoch 1965 ) which did not fit for a turnover , predicts @xmath493,000  jy at 10  mhz .",
    "the lowest reliable flux density measurement at that frequency is the penticton 10  mhz flux density of 28,000  jy ( epoch 1965.9 , i.e. contemporaneous , @xcite ) , which is a factor of 3.3 below the expected value .",
    "( this corresponds to a 10  mhz free - free optical depth by a uniform external absorber of @xmath41.2 , an oversimplification since some of the absorption must be internal . ) as described in section  [ optdep ] , an average free - free optical depth for the unshocked ejecta at 74  mhz is @xmath40.5 , which rapidly inflates to @xmath801 at 10  mhz , i.e. completely opaque .",
    "if the absorbing ejecta blocked @xmath430% of the back surface of cas  a s nonthermal emission , @xmath485% of cas  a s 10  mhz emission , or @xmath479,000  jy , should escape the remnant .",
    "we can account for the remaining deficit by an intervening thermal absorber with @xmath81 .",
    "thus , a simplistic scenario has @xmath479,000  jy of cas  a s 10  mhz emission emerging from the remnant after being attenuated by @xmath415% from the unshocked ejecta .",
    "thereafter the emerging emission is further attenuated by an intervening ionized component of the ism with 10  mhz optical depth @xmath41 .",
    "the distribution of low density gas in the interstellar medium was constrained by @xcite , using the observed , patchy thermal absorption inferred from the low frequency , integrated spectra of galactic snrs .",
    "( several of those systems have since been resolved with legacy vla data @xcite . )",
    "the measured optical depths at 30.9  mhz typically ranged from 0.1 - 1 , though some remnants showed no turnovers while others were more heavily absorbed .",
    "the nature of the absorption was consistent with higher frequency recombination line observations that postulated extended region envelopes ( ehes ) associated with normal regions @xcite .",
    "the inferred ism 10  mhz free - free optical depth unity discussed above , and required to further attenuate cas  a s emerging emission , scales to @xmath40.1 at 30.9 mhz .",
    "thus the low frequency turnover in the integrated spectrum of cas  a is qualitatively consistent with a combination of intrinsic absorption from unshocked ejecta and extrinsic absorption by ehes located along the line of sight .",
    "in retrospect the @xcite low frequency turnover would be conspicuous in its absence based on what we now know about ionized gas in both the ism and cas  a.",
    "the radio detection of thermally absorbing , unshocked ejecta inside a young galactic snr by the legacy vla 74  mhz system only scratches the surface of possibilities for emerging low frequency systems with greater capabilities . with the transition to the fully digital electronics and new correlator of the vla , the narrowband 74 and 330",
    "mhz legacy systems have been replaced with an improved , broad - band `` low band '' receiving system @xcite .",
    "the new , single receiver system brings significant improvements over its two narrow band predecessors , and will become available to the vla user community in 2014 .    for broad band systems probing below 74  mhz , e.g. lofar low band @xcite , or lwa , the frequency dependence of thermal absorption significantly enhances the effect . gradually tuning to lower frequencies",
    "as the absorption grows can break the optical depth degeneracy between temperature and emission measure , and deconvolve the radial superposition of nonthermal emitting and thermal absorbing regions .",
    "lower frequency observations with sufficient angular resolution ( e.g. lofar low band ) can test our qualitative assessment of the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic thermal absorption contributing to the observed turnover in cas  a s integrated spectrum below 38  mhz .",
    "it is also important to constrain the emission at frequencies above 74  mhz just prior to the onset of absorption , as offered e.g. by lofar high band , mwa , the gmrt , and vla low band .",
    "@xcite also confirmed shorter scale ( 5 - 10 yr ) temporal variations at 74  mhz consistent with previous reports in the literature for low frequencies @xcite .",
    "these have generally been attributed to the interaction of the forward shock with an inhomogeneous csm or ism .",
    "however some variation must also arise from inside cas  a , as the reverse shock advances into the unshocked ejecta and affects its opacity .",
    "together with the secular decrease due to adiabatic expansion @xcite , the overall temporal behavior is necessarily complex , and requires higher resolution , broad band low frequency measurements to understand .",
    "we suggest that cas  a s low frequency flux density should be monitored routinely across a range of lower frequencies ; for instruments such as lofar or lwa this would require only a few minutes of observations every few weeks or months and would allow a much better determination of the range of timescales over which such variations occur .",
    "we have imaged cas  a from 5  ghz to 74  mhz in all four configurations of the legacy vla with follow - up observations at 74 and 330  mhz with the legacy vla+pt link .",
    "our spatially resolved spectral index maps confirm the interior spectral flattening measured earlier , but at higher signal - to - noise and resolution .",
    "comparison with _ spitzer _",
    "infrared spectra confirms the earlier hypothesis that the spectral flattening is due to thermal absorption by cool , unshocked ejecta photoionized by x - ray radiation from cas  a s reverse shock .",
    "we use the spectral flattening to measure the free - free optical depth .    next ,",
    "using priors of electron temperature , atomic number , and electron to ion ratios , we derive an emission measure from the measured optical depth . with an assumed geometry , informed from three - dimensional modeling based on higher frequency studies",
    ", we use the emission measure to place constraints on both the density and total mass of the unshocked ejecta .",
    "we consider modest , physically plausible variations in both our priors and the assumed geometry , and find that the effect on the total mass is relatively modest , varying by a factor of about two .",
    "furthermore , our derived total mass is consistent with recent model predictions @xcite .",
    "after accounting for the relative ages of cas  a and sn1006 , our derived mass density is much higher than found in sn1006 , not unexpected since cas  a ( type iib ) and sn1006 ( type ia ) emerged from two fundamentally different supernova explosion types . however ,",
    "if there is a systematic difference in unshocked ejecta density for core collapse vs. type ia snrs , low frequency radio data can be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "finally , we consider the contribution of the intrinsic thermal absorption to the known turnover of cas  a s integrated spectrum at much lower frequencies .",
    "we find that the intrinsic thermal absorption from the unshocked ejecta , combined with extrinsic absorption from a known , patchy distribution of low density ism gas , are completely consistent with the low frequency turnover .",
    "the promise of the emerging instruments is expanding the population of snrs , young and old , that can be probed for intrinsic and extrinsic thermal absorption and shock acceleration variations beyond pathologically bright sources like cas  a. more generally , the seemingly ubiquitous detection of resolved thermal absorption by the 74  mhz legacy vla against the galactic background @xcite and towards , discrete non thermal sources ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirms the phenomena will continue to emerge as a powerful tool for low frequency astrophysics .",
