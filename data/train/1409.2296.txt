    "high - precision timing of millisecond pulsars has long been proposed as one of the methods to directly detect gravitational waves ( gws hereafter ) @xcite .",
    "pulsar timing can detect gws in the frequency range from approximately @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the time span of the observations and @xmath9 is the number of observations .",
    "typically , this frequency window extends from @xmath10 , corresponding to a bi - weekly observation scheme , to @xmath11 , corresponding to a @xmath8 of several years @xcite .",
    "the most prominent gw sources in this frequency range are coalescing super - massive black hole binaries ( smbhbs ) located in the nuclei of merged galaxies . as there are expected to be a large number of such systems , their signals overlap and form a stochastic gw background ( sgwb ) @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been made to detect or limit the sgwb using single pulsars or a pulsar timing array ( pta ) @xcite , placing more and more stringent upper limits on its amplitude .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been argued that the most up - to - date sgwb limits from ptas are close to the theoretically expected values of the smbhb sgwb , making its imminent detection possible .",
    "modeling of the expected gw background shows that gws from close and/or massive enough smbhb systems will stand out from the background as resolvable signals @xcite .",
    "an increasing number of investigations has been performed in the recent years concerning the expected amplitude of individual gw sources : searched for possible gw induced timing residual variations in psrs b1937 + 21 and j1713 + 0747 .",
    "the gws they were searching for were from a presumed smbhb at sagittarius a * , which might have been responsible for the @xmath12106 day quasi - periodic radio flux variations @xcite .",
    "they found no timing residuals larger than 150ns at the corresponding period of 53 days in their data , which means the strain of gws emitted from sgr a * should be less than @xmath13 at a frequency of @xmath14 , assuming an optimal polarization .",
    "@xcite derived general expressions for the expected timing residuals induced by gws emitted from a slowly evolving smbhb , and ruled out the proposed smbhb system in 3c 66b @xcite with 95% confidence since no expected fluctuations were observed in the timing residuals of psr j1857 + 0943 .",
    "@xcite ( y10 hereafter ) determined the sensitivity of the parkes pta to gws emitted by a non - evolving individual smbhb from @xmath15 to @xmath16 using the timing results of 18 pulsars from the @xcite dataset .",
    "the data were most sensitive to gws at the frequency of @xmath17 , with gw strain larger than @xmath18 .",
    "detecting gws from individual sources can provide useful astronomical information , such as the sky position , the chirp mass - distance combination of the sources @xcite and limit the merger rate of nearby smbhbs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pulsar timing parallax signal enables us to take advantage of the pulsar term in the timing residuals to determine more parameters such as the distance , the chirp mass and the spin of the smbhb @xcite separately , and increase the accuracy of pulsar distance measurements @xcite .",
    "the likelihood that more individual sources are resolvable at frequencies above @xmath19 @xcite argues strongly for performing observations of pulsars at a higher cadence .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of @xcite predicts the strain of the gws from resolvable single sources to be @xmath20 .",
    "here we present our dedicated campaign using psr b1937 + 21 .",
    "this pulsar was chosen despite the fact that it is known to exhibit long term timing noise and time - dependent dispersion measure ( dm ) variations @xcite because it is bright , isolated and relatively consistent in flux . additionally , the effects of dm variations are potentially correctable .",
    "we use 528 pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) over the span of 650 days to obtain the timing solution , resulting in an average time between toas of just 1.23 days , and more typically the pulsar was observed daily or twice daily . with such high cadence observations , we managed to extend our sensitivity to gws with frequency up to @xmath21 , which is in the frequency regime so far probed only by observations of close binary systems @xcite .",

    "five datasets from three telescopes were used .",
    "the first two datasets are from jodrell bank observatory , obtained with the 76 m lovell telescope ( lt , hereafter ) and the 42 ft ( 13 m diameter ) telescope ( 42 ft ) , with the roach and cobra2 backends , both performing online folding and coherent dedispersion using ` dspsr ` @xcite .",
    "the roach backend of the lovell telescope observes a @xmath12400mhz wide band at l - band , centered at 1532mhz @xcite .",

    "the daily toas are combined in groups of eight using the binning tools provided by ` tempo2 ` @xcite , 63 toas are produced from the 42 ft dataset .",
    "the three other datasets are from the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) using the pumaii backend @xcite .",
    "observations were taken approximately monthly at three frequencies , centered at 350mhz , 1380mhz and 2273mhz respectively .",
    "the bandwidths used for these frequencies are either 80mhz or 160mhz , and are listed in table [ obs ] . for this study",
    "we have used observations taken in the time span from may 2011 till may 2013 .",
    "the observations were stored offline and coherently dedispersed and folded using dspsr , and subsequent manipulation was done using ` psrchive ` .",
    "for each observation multiple data products were stored with varying frequency and time resolution . to generate toas ,",
    "fully scrunched profiles were cross - correlated with an analytic template created by ` psrchive ` based on integrated high - signal - to - noise observations at each frequency . for all telescopes and frequencies the toas were referred to local time using a hydrogen maser at the observatory , then converted to tt(tai ) using the gps system and corrections on utc as provided by the ` bipm ` . a schematic plot of the dates on which toas were obtained are plotted in fig .",

    "psr b1937 + 21 shows significant dm variations , which are the main source of timing noise at the level of microseconds at the frequency of @xmath22 over a time span of a couple of years . to attempt to remove this noise , we need to evaluate the dm value at each observation epoch . for this purpose , we chose to use the wsrt350 dataset because it has the best combination of snr and fractional frequency difference for determining the dm . here",
    "we will describe the process we followed : first , we started by using all 512 frequency channels of the wsrt350 observations .",
    "then we selected one observation , aligned it in pulse phase across all frequency channels and collapsed them in one channel to make a pulse profile template .",

    ", we formed a new template and cross - correlated that with each individual observation to generate new toas . comparing these toas with the timing solution including the dm(@xmath23 ) at each epoch , we created a set of residuals that retain some unmodeled structure ( see fig .",
    "[ residmofff350 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the dm correction using wrst350 along does not sufficiently remove the effect of ism ; therefore further investigations are necessary .",
    "scattering in the ism may cause the pulse profiles to be broadened and this effect is more pronounced at low frequencies . while the scattering will affect the shape of the pulse profile ,",
    "if it remains constant , and is accounted for in the template used to generate the toas , the timing should be unaffected .",
    "however , if the degree of scattering changes then this could lead to timing noise .    to determine the influence of scattering on our dm determinations and toas we adopted the following procedure : first , we collapsed the 512 frequency channels of the wsrt350 data into 8 frequency bands .",
    "an example of the eight profiles , obtained on mjd 56428 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ scatteredprofile ] .",
    "then we constructed a frequency dependent template by convolving a reference profile with a truncated exponential , i.e. , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the pulse phase , @xmath29 is the period of the pulsar and @xmath30 is the broadening timescale at frequency @xmath31 .",

    "these are below the sensitivity curve generated from 18 pulsars by y10 about 0.5 dex .",
    "however the periodic structure in the timing noise does not appear until mjd  56000 .",
    "this is confirmed by splitting the dataset in two parts and computing the respective power spectra .",
    "indeed , the power spectrum of the first part does not exhibit any distinctive peaks at low frequencies whereas the second part does .",
    "this fact argues against the possibility that this signal is due to a gw , which we would expect to be present across the whole data span .    over a time span",
    "longer than 20 years , the noise of psr b1937 + 21 is dominated by components at frequencies lower than @xmath93 .",
    "@xcite recently proposed that the noise structure could be explained by the existence of an asteroid belt which extends to @xmath94 from the pulsar .",
    "our study is focused on a much smaller time span , where the dominating noise components lower than @xmath61 are absorbed by the fitting process .",

    "<S> we present the results of a search for gravitational waves ( gws ) from individual sources using high cadence observations of psr b1937 + 21 . </S>",
    "<S> the data were acquired from an intensive observation campaign with the lovell telescope at jodrell bank , between june 2011 and may 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> the almost daily cadence achieved , allowed us to be sensitive to gws with frequencies up to @xmath0 , extending the upper bound of the typical frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays . </S>",
    "<S> we used observations taken at three different radio frequencies with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in order to correct for dispersion measure effects and scattering variances . </S>",
    "<S> the corrected timing residuals exhibited an unmodeled periodic noise with an amplitude @xmath1 and a frequency of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as the signal is not present in the entire data set , we attributed it to the rotational behaviour of the pulsar , ruling out the possibilities of being either due to a gw or an asteroid as the cause . after removing this noise component </S>",
    "<S> , we placed limits on the gw strain of individual sources equaling to @xmath3 and @xmath4 at @xmath5 for random and optimal sources locations respectively .    </S>",
