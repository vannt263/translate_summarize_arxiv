    ". however , the data points acquired by laser scanners are often complex and unorganized",
    ". moreover , the absence of the connectivity information in point cloud data poses difficulties in understanding the underlying geometry of the 3d objects .",
    "this largely hinders the applications of the data .",
    "for instance , many applications in 3d printing @xcite and texture mapping @xcite are built upon mesh structures . with the rapid development of the computer industry , finding a high quality meshing framework for point cloud data is increasingly important .",
    "one possible approach for mesh generation on point clouds is to parameterize a point cloud to a simpler domain with the corresponding genus , such as the unit sphere for genus-0 point clouds .",
    "then , a triangulation or a quadrangulation can be created on the parameter domain instead of the original complicated point cloud .",
    "finally , a mesh structure on the point cloud can be defined with respect to the structure on the parameter domain .",
    "the major difficulty of computing parameterizations of point - set surfaces is the extremely limited information they can provide .",
    "most of the existing surface parameterization methods are developed on meshes only .",
    "in other words , besides the locations of the point data , a given connectivity is also required as an input .",
    "the connectivity information plays an important role in representing the surface structure as well as in approximating continuous operators to minimize certain distortions . as a result",
    ", most conventional mesh parameterization approaches fail to work on point clouds . without the connectivity information ,",
    "the underlying geometry of the point cloud data become more obscure . hence , it is more challenging in developing parameterization schemes with good quality for point cloud data .",
    "a good parameterization scheme of point cloud must satisfy certain criteria .",
    "in particular , it should retain the geometric information of a point cloud as complete as possible . in our case ,",
    "one of the ultimate goals is to create a triangulation for a point cloud by finding a delaunay triangulation on a simpler parameter domain .",
    "it is noteworthy that in general , a mesh structure with good quality on the parameter domain does not necessarily imply that the associated mesh structure of the original data points is satisfactory . in other words , meshing",
    "the parameter domain may provide meaningless results if the parameterization scheme is arbitrarily chosen .",
    "note that the regularity of the mesh structures is related to the angle structure of the triangles and quadrilaterals . to ensure the regularity of the associated mesh structure on the point cloud",

    "this motivates us the use of conformal mappings .    for smooth surfaces",
    ", it is well known that the conformal parameterizations preserve angles and hence the local geometry of the surfaces .",
    "it is natural to consider the discrete analog of conformal parameterization for point cloud data .",
    "since data points are sampled from real 3d surfaces , we can assume that every point cloud has an underlying geometry .",

    "quasi - conformal theories are applied to enhance the conformality of the spherical parameterization .",
    "the computation is linear and the conformality distortion of the parameterization is minimal .",
    "however , the algorithm is developed on triangular meshes only . in this work ,",
    "we extend and improve the algorithm for point clouds with spherical topology .",

    "the lb operator in the mentioned algorithm can be accurately computed on point clouds .",
    "also , we replace a key step of solving for a quasi - conformal map in the mentioned algorithm by an iterative scheme , called the _ north - south reiteration _ , for improving the conformality of the parameterizations . furthermore , we introduce a balancing scheme for enhancing the distribution of the parameterization results .",
    "experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed parameterization algorithm for genus-0 point clouds .",

    "note that the key step in the method in @xcite for correcting the distortion via a composition of quasi - conformal maps does not work for the case of point clouds .",
    "now , we propose a new method to correct the conformality distortion by solely using the lb operator .",
    "we begin with the south - pole stereographic projection @xmath98 to project the spherical point cloud back onto the complex plane . under the projection ,",
    "the north pole of the sphere , which corresponds to the outermost region of @xmath200 , is mapped to the innermost region on the complex plane .",

    "in contrast , our new method only involves solving laplace equations .",
    "the equivalence between the two approaches can be explained as follows .    in the first step ,",
    "the conformality distortion of the spherical parameterization is due to the error in the stereographic projection .",
    "then in the approach in @xcite , the entire initial parameterization result is used in equation ( [ eqt : beltramipde ] ) for computing a quasi - conformal map in order to cancel the distortion .",
    "the method is theoretically guaranteed by the composition formula ( [ eqt : composition_formula ] ) of quasi - conformal maps .",
    "in contrast , in our new approach , we only make use of the most accurate part in the initial parameterization result .",
    "more explicitly , we use the southern - most regions as the boundary constraints and compute the remaining part of the spherical parameterization again , with the aid of the lb operator",
    ". the replacement of the south - pole step in @xcite by our new south - pole step can be justified by the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath208 and @xmath209 be two riemann surfaces , and @xmath24 is a prescribed beltrami differential on @xmath210 .",
    "then , the map solved by equation ( [ eqt : beltramipde ] ) is a harmonic map between @xmath211 and @xmath209 .",
    "consequently , solving the laplace equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) is equivalent to solving equation ( [ eqt : beltramipde ] ) .",
    "let @xmath212 be the coordinates of @xmath210 with respect to the distorted metric @xmath213 .",
    "then , the harmonic map between @xmath211 and @xmath209 is a critical point of the following energy @xmath214 on the other hand , by definition of the beltrami equation ( [ eqt : beltrami ] ) , the solution to equation ( [ eqt : beltramipde ] ) is the critical point of the following energy functional @xmath215 it is shown in @xcite that the above two energy functionals have the same set of critical points .",
    "hence , solving the generalized laplace equation ( [ eqt : beltramipde ] ) for a quasi - conformal map is equivalent to solving the laplace equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) for a harmonic map under the distorted metric .",
    "then , the conformality of our approach is again guaranteed by the composition formula ( [ eqt : composition_formula ] ) of quasi - conformal maps .",
    "therefore , in the continuous case , under suitable boundary conditions in equation ( [ eqt : beltramipde ] ) and equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) , both of the two methods are theoretically guaranteed for producing a conformal map .",
    "however , in the discrete case , the two methods perform differently . for the case of triangular meshes ,",
    "the beltrami coefficients can be accurately computed and the composition formula ( [ eqt : composition_formula ] ) of quasi - conformal maps is accurate under the discretization . in this situation ,",
    "the method in @xcite can be effectively applied . yet , for the case of point clouds , we only have an approximation of the lb operator but not the beltrami coefficients , and there is no guarantee about the composition formula ( [ eqt : composition_formula ] ) of quasi - conformal maps .",
    "consequently , it is more suitable to use our proposed method as it only involves solving the laplace equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) .",
    "however , since the accuracy of our proposed method depends on the boundary constraints in solving the laplace equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) , the boundary constraints obtained from the initial parameterization result may contain small error and hence slightly affect the result in solving equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to perform some more iterations for obtaining a more accurate result .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the parameterization algorithm in @xcite for triangular meshes , no further steps are required after the second step .",
    "however , because of the abovementioned issue about the boundary constraints in the laplace equation ( [ eqt : laplacepc2 ] ) , further iterations are necessary for enhancing the parameterization result .",
    "we call them the _ north - south ( n - s ) reiterations_. in each n - s reiteration , two laplace equations are solved again after the north - pole stereographic projection and the south - pole stereographic projection respectively . for solving each laplace equation",
    ", we fix the outermost @xmath216 points on @xmath95 to ensure the existence of the solution .",
    "more specifically , in each n - s reiteration , we first project the previous spherical parameterization result onto the complex plane using the north - pole stereographic projection .",
    "next , we compute a harmonic map @xmath217 by solving the laplace equation @xmath218 with the boundary constraints @xmath219 for the outermost @xmath216 of the data points on @xmath95 . after obtaining @xmath220 ,",
    "the inverse north - pole stereographic projection is again applied , followed by the south - pole stereographic projection .",
    "then , we compute another harmonic map @xmath221 by solving the laplace equation @xmath222 with the boundary constraints @xmath223 for the outermost @xmath216 of the data points on @xmath95 . we then define the updated spherical parameterization by the composition map @xmath224 we check whether the above updated parameterization result is close to the previous parameterization result @xmath225 . if yes , then the parameterization is stable and we complete the algorithm .",
    "if no , we apply another n - s reiteration on the updated parameterization point by repeating the procedures and so on . in practice , we choose @xmath226 . our proposed spherical conformal parameterization scheme is outlined in algorithm [ alg : pc_spherical ] .",
    "to explain the motivation of our proposed n - s reiteration scheme , we define the _ n - s dirichlet energy _ by @xmath227 where @xmath21 is the dirichlet energy .",
    "it follows that the minimum of @xmath228 is attained if and only if @xmath229 and @xmath230 are minimized , which implies that @xmath21 is minimized and @xmath10 is conformal .",
    "therefore , to find a conformal @xmath10 , we can consider minimizing the n - s dirichlet energy @xmath231 .",
    "more specifically , we aim to minimize both @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "note that these two energies are respectively minimized by solving the laplace equations ( [ eqt : laplacepc3 ] ) and ( [ eqt : laplacepc4 ] ) in our proposed n - s reiteration . introducing the n - s reiteration for minimizing the energies is advantageous for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it linearizes the computation as we only need to solve linear systems on @xmath95 .",
    "secondly , it avoids the error induced by the stereographic projection as we consider both the north - pole step and the south - pole step in each reiteration .",
    "note that theoretically we only need to take away the two points of infinity , and at least 3 points on @xmath95 are required to be fixed to guarantee the existence of the solution of the two laplace equations .",
    "however , in terms of the numerical computations , the large matrix equations may be ill - posed if only 3 points are fixed as boundary constraints .",
    "therefore , we consider fixing the outermost @xmath216 of data points in solving equations ( [ eqt : laplacepc3 ] ) and ( [ eqt : laplacepc4 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , fixing these extra points may not affect the accuracy of the solution too much .",
    "this can be explained with the aid of the beltrami holomorphic flow @xcite as follows .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of quasi - conformal diffeomorphisms of @xmath232 that fix the points @xmath233 and @xmath234 and the set of smooth complex - valued functions @xmath24 on @xmath232 with @xmath235 .",
    "furthermore , the solution @xmath236 to the beltrami equation ( [ eqt : beltrami ] ) depends holomorphically on @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath237 be a family of beltrami coefficients depending on a real or complex parameter @xmath238 .",
    "suppose also that @xmath239 can be written in the form @xmath240 for @xmath241 , with suitable @xmath24 in the unit ball of @xmath242 such that @xmath243 as @xmath244 .",
    "then , for all @xmath245 , @xmath246 locally uniformly on @xmath95 as @xmath247 , where @xmath248    in our case , as the conformality distortion of the outermost region is negligible , @xmath249 is compactly supported around origin .",
    "hence , it can be deduced from equation ( [ eqt : bhf ] ) in the above theorem that the data points located farther away from the origin will be associated with a smaller flow @xmath250 , as the denominator in the integral becomes larger . therefore , in each iteration , the outermost points will remain almost unchanged , while the innermost points ( which have the largest conformality distortion ) will be adjusted and improved .",
    "in other words , fixing more outermost points for the numerical stability does not affect the solution much .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ experiment ] to verify the convergence of our n - s reiteration scheme .",
    "intuitively , the boundary constraints in equations ( [ eqt : laplacepc3 ] ) and ( [ eqt : laplacepc4 ] ) are adjusted to the positions associated with a conformal map by the iterations .",
    "they are observed to eventually stabilize and hence we obtain the desired conformal map by solving equations ( [ eqt : laplacepc3 ] ) and ( [ eqt : laplacepc4 ] ) with these boundary constraints .",
    "finally , we make an important remark about our proposed spherical conformal parameterization algorithm for genus-0 point clouds .",
    "in addition to genus-0 point clouds , our proposed algorithm also efficiently works on genus-0 triangular meshes .",
    "note that for triangular meshes , the lb operator can be easily constructed by computing the cotangent weights on the given mesh structures . also , solving laplace equations on the complex plane requires only linear time .",
    "hence , our proposed algorithm can serve as an alternative approach for computing spherical conformal parameterizations of genus-0 closed triangular meshes in linear time .",

    "although the conformality does not change under the mbius transformations , the distribution of the points on the sphere does .",

    "in particular , we define the conformality distortion of the parameterization by the angular distortion between the two meshes .",
    "the angle difference provides an accurate measurement of the conformality distortion of the parameterizations .",
    "it can be easily observed in figure [ fig : lion ] and figure [ fig : bulldog ] that the histograms of the angle differences highly concentrate at 0 . besides , for better visualizations of the spherical conformal parameterization results , we color the surfaces by the approximated mean curvature on the source surfaces",
    ". it can be observed from the colored figures that the local geometries of the point clouds are well preserved under our proposed spherical conformal parameterization algorithm .",

    "the plots demonstrate the convergence of our north - south reiteration scheme .",
    "we compare our proposed spherical conformal parameterization method for genus-0 point clouds with the spherical embedding method proposed by zwicker and gotsman @xcite and the global conformal map @xcite . in our experiment , @xmath297 nearest neighbors of every point are used for approximating the lb operator in algorithm [ alg : pc_spherical ] .",
    "the stopping threshold for the n - s reiteration is set to be @xmath298 .",
    "table [ table : performance ] summarizes the computational time and the conformality distortion of the three schemes .",
    "it is noteworthy that our proposed method produces spherical conformal parameterizations with better conformality .",
    "the better conformality obtained by our method is attributed to the south - pole step in our algorithm , which is conceptually equivalent to a composition of quasi - conformal maps . with this specific step",

    "our meshing scheme has two important advantages .",
    "first , the regularity of the triangulations generated is guaranteed by the preservation of the angle structures of the delaunay triangulations computed on the spherical parameterizations .",
    "as the angle structures are well retained under the spherical conformal parameterization , a regular triangulation defined on the parameterized point clouds can effectively induce a regular and almost - delaunay triangulation on the original point clouds . besides figure [ fig : lion ] ,",
    "figure [ fig : bulldog ] and figure [ fig : convoluted ] , some more examples of triangulations created by our approach are shown in figure [ fig : mesh_zoom ] . it can be observed that our meshing method can handle point clouds with different geometry .",
    "high quality triangulations can be created even with the presence of sharp , non - convex and convoluted regions on the input point clouds .",
    "second , unlike most of the existing meshing methods , the meshes produced by our proposed scheme are guaranteed to be genus-0 closed meshes .",
    "no holes or unwanted boundaries will be present in our meshing result .",

    "figure [ fig : meshing_results ] provides a comparison between our method and the three mentioned approaches .",
    "it can be observed that our meshing scheme and the tight cocone algorithm @xcite produce high quality triangulations , while the triangulations produced by the approaches in @xcite and @xcite consist of certain sharp and irregular triangles .",

    "the delaunay ratios by different meshing algorithms are presented in table [ table : delaunay ] . because of the high accuracy of our spherical conformal parameterizations , our proposed scheme achieves significantly better triangulation results when compared with the spherical embedding algorithm @xcite and the marching cubes algorithm @xcite . also , our results are comparable to or even slightly better than those of the tight cocone algorithm @xcite .",
    "the comparisons demonstrate the advantages of our proposed meshing scheme .",

    "two examples of the quad meshes generated by our method are given in figure [ fig : quad_result ] . to create quad meshes of point clouds ,",
    "we make use of a standard spherical quad mesh and our spherical conformal parameterization results . with the aid of the spherical conformal parameterizations",
    ", we can interpolate the standard quad mesh onto the input point clouds and thus generate quad mesh representations .",
    "because of the conformality of our parameterization scheme , the resulting quad meshes are with high quality .",
    "also , the meshes are guaranteed to be topology preserving .                before ending this subsection",
    ", we demonstrate the significance of our proposed balancing scheme in the spherical conformal parameterization .",
    "the redistribution is vital for the meshing quality .",
    "figure [ fig : distribution ] shows the meshing results with and without the redistribution scheme .",
    "it can be easily observed that if the spherical parameterization of a genus-0 point cloud is unbalanced , then on the mesh generated by interpolation with the aid of the spherical conformal parameterization , most of the vertices will be concentrated at one small region of the mesh . as a result ,",
    "most features of the underlying surface are lost .",
    "in contrast , with our proposed balancing scheme , a high quality mesh can be effectively generated .",
    "the above results reflect the importance of our balancing scheme in the point cloud parameterizations for meshing .",
    "our meshing framework is stable under geometrical and topological noises of the input genus-0 point clouds . in some situations ,",
    "the point clouds obtained by 3d cameras are geometrically noisy . to compute triangulations which represent the underlying surfaces",
    ", we can first apply a poisson filtering on the noisy point clouds .",
    "then , with the aid of our spherical conformal parameterization , we can obtain high quality triangulations on a uniform spherical point cloud and interpolate them back onto the filtered point clouds to produce meshed surfaces .",
    "we first demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by two synthetic examples .",
    "figure [ fig : geometric_noise ] shows a synthetic point cloud with 3% uniformly distributed random noise and our meshing result .",
    "we can also construct a faithful triangulated mesh on the geometrically noisy point cloud without any filtering or sampling procedure .",
    "figure [ fig : geometric_noise2 ] shows the triangulation result of our meshing scheme and the tight cocone algorithm @xcite on the noisy point cloud in figure [ fig : geometric_noise ] .",
    "all points of the point cloud are considered and fixed in the construction of the triangulation .",
    "it can be observed that there are irregular triangulations and topological holes on the result by @xcite , while our meshing scheme guarantees a regular and topology preserving triangulation even for noisy input point clouds .    besides , it is common that the sampling processes result in non - uniformly sampled point clouds . in particular , there may be large holes on certain parts of the point clouds sampled from genus-0 objects , which create topological ambiguities and hinder mesh generations .",
    "our parameterization and meshing scheme produce satisfactory results with these topological noises .",
    "moreover , the meshes generated are guaranteed to be genus-0 closed meshes .",
    "figure [ fig : topological_noise ] shows a synthetic point cloud with 1021 randomly created topological holes .",
    "it can be observed that our algorithm produces a satisfactory meshing result .",

    "the above experiments demonstrate the stability and robustness of our proposed method for noisy point clouds .                                  with our proposed spherical conformal parameterization scheme ,",
    "multilevel representations of a genus-0 point cloud can be easily achieved .",
    "we start with a coarse spherical point cloud .",
    "the vertices on the sphere can be interpolated onto the genus-0 point cloud with the aid of its spherical parameterization .",
    "then , we can progressively subdivide the sphere using existing subdivision methods , such as the butterfly subdivision method @xcite and the loop subdivision method @xcite .",
    "for each subdivided sphere , we can repeat the mentioned interpolation procedure and obtain a coarse representation of the point cloud .",
    "this method results in multilevel representations of the point cloud . as the subdivision level increases , more details of the point cloud are represented .",
    "examples of multilevel representations of genus-0 point clouds are given in figure [ fig : igea_multilevel ] and figure [ fig : vaselion_multilevel ] .",

    "the subdivision connectivity of the results can be easily observed .",
    "the results indicate that our method can effectively generate the multilevel representations of genus-0 point clouds .",
    "in this paper , we presented a novel framework for meshing genus-0 point clouds via global spherical conformal parameterizations .",
    "we extended and improved the parameterization algorithm for triangular meshes in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we enhanced the accuracy for approximating the lb operator on point clouds by using a new gaussian - type weight function . secondly , we proposed an iterative scheme called the n - s reiteration to replace the step of solving for a quasi - conformal map in @xcite for achieving better conformality .",
    "thirdly , we introduced a balancing scheme for guaranteeing an even distribution of the spherical point cloud parameterization .",
