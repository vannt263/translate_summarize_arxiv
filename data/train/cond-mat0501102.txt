    "the dynamics of hot electrons and holes at surfaces have attracted considerable attention in recent years , not least due to their importance in photochemistry and charge - transfer processes such as electronically - induced adsorbate reactions .",
    "a particular focus has been the study of quasiparticle lifetimes associated with excitations in the band of surface - localised electronic states found at the ( 111 ) surfaces of the noble metals , which have become a testing ground for new theoretical , computational and experimental methods aimed at developing a deeper fundamental understanding of quasiparticle dynamics .",
    "@xcite theoretically , much progress has been made towards a quantitative account of inelastic electron - electron @xcite ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) and electron - phonon @xcite ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) interactions of these states , whilst techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite ( stm ) and spectroscopy @xcite ( sts ) , and photoelectron spectroscopy @xcite have been used to construct a steadily - increasing database of experimentally - determined lifetimes .",
    "the lifetimes of excitations with energies spanning just a few tenths of an ev have been shown to reflect a wealth of key surface physics ; intra and interband scattering processes ; spatially - dependent and @xmath2-electron screening ; defect - scattering processes ; electron - phonon interactions with rayleigh ( surface ) and bulk phonons ; and their temperature dependencies .",
    "lifetime studies using the stm can be divided into two approaches : those which exploit the phase coherence of quantum interference patterns @xcite and those based upon lineshape analysis @xcite .",
    "the lineshape method uses spectroscopic measurements of the differential conductivity @xmath3 at a fixed position above the surface , and relies upon the presence of spectral structure that contains a signature of the quasiparticle lifetime . on pristine surfaces",
    "the only such feature is the band edge onset , so that only the lifetime of excitations at this energy are accessible .",
    "however , electron confinement to natural or artificial nanoscale electron resonators , such as those shown in figure [ fig : resonator ] ,    results in energy quantisation , inducing spectral structure in the form of a series of resonant levels at energies that can be controlled through hanges in the dimensions and geometry of the resonator .",
    "the quasiparticle lifetime is then reflected in the level widths @xcite , but additional contributions arise due to lossy boundary scattering that must be accounted for if lineshape analysis is to be used to determine the intrinsic quasiparticle lifetime . in this paper",
    "we provide analytic and numerical results for the linewidths of electrons confined by different nanoscale resonators , and discuss their use in lifetime studies using sts .    the starting point of our analyses is the equation satisfied by the single particle green function @xmath4 @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a two - dimensional position vector , @xmath7 the effective mass and @xmath8 the electron energy with respect to the surface state band minimum . confinement is due to the potential @xmath9 , which in general will remain unspecified .",
    "only the scattering properties of @xmath9 are relevant .",
    "we also include an inelastic potential or self energy @xmath10 to account for the effects of @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering .",
    "this is related to the lifetime @xmath11 associated with these processes by @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite the local density of surface states ( ldos ) is obtained from the green function as @xmath13 ( the 2 is for spin - degeneracy ) .",
    "we associate the ldos with @xmath3 in the usual way @xcite . in section [ sec : corral ] we consider circular atomic corral resonators , and in section [ sec : islands ] circular adatom and vacancy islands .",
    "non - circular resonators are discussed in section [ sec : noncirc ] .",
    "contributions to experimentally measured linewidths arising from thermal broadening and instrumental effects are described in section [ sec : experiment ] , and in section [ sec : discuss ] we illustrate how the results of our analyses may be used to identify appropriate resonator structures for lifetime studies .",
    "atomic corrals are artificial structures in which individual adatoms are positioned with atomic scale precision into closed geometries @xcite",
    ". strong scattering of the surface state electrons by the surrounding adatoms leads to confinement .",
    "the `` standard model '' for describing these systems is the @xmath14-wave scattering model @xcite , in which the solution to ( [ eqn : g1 ] ) is given by @xcite    [ eqn : gms ] @xmath15 [ eqn : sm ]    the sums in ( [ eqn : gms ] ) are over the @xmath16 identical adatoms at locations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , which are characterised by the scattering @xmath19-matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the phaseshift .",

    "we have introduced @xmath38 , the linear density of atoms making up the corral .",
    "poles in the green function which correspond to bound electron states that have amplitude at the center of the corral occur when @xmath39 . using the asymptotic forms @xcite for @xmath35",

    "@xcite the exact energies in this limit have the same form as ( [ eqn : levels ] ) but with @xmath45 ( @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) replaced by the nth zero @xcite of the bessel function @xmath35 , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 for @xmath50 ) .",
    "this close agreement validates the use of asymptotic forms in obtaining ( [ eqn : cond ] ) .    in the hard - wall limit ( [ eqn : widths ] )",
    "shows that the resonance widths are directly related to the inelastic @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering rates at the energy of the level . however , in practice there are physical limits to how large the linear adatom density @xmath51 can become , with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the nearest - neighbour separation of surface atoms .",
    "consequently the confinement is always less effective than in the hard - wall limit , which results in increased level widths . solving ( [ eqn : cond ] )",
    "to first order in this case yields level widths @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",

    "the accuracy of the approximations made in obtaining the expression in ( [ eqn : gammac ] ) are confirmed by the close agreement to be found between the level widths predicted by it and with those found by fitting the ldos ( [ eqn : ldos ] ) with a series of lorenzians or from iterative solution to ( [ eqn : cond ] ) .",
    "the general trend to be observed in the level widths is that they ncrease almost linearly with energy but are approximately halved by simultanously doubling the radius and the number of atoms in the boundary ring .",
    "in a second class of resonator confinement results from scattering at ascending or descending steps . these are adatom or vacancy islands .",

    ", one can recognise within @xmath73 waves incident and reflected from the confining potential , enabling the coefficient @xmath74 to be related to the planar reflection coefficient @xmath57 of the step at the island edge .",
    "using this relationship and equating @xmath74 to 1 gives @xmath75 as the condition for bound states visible in sts at the center of islands .",
    "assuming confinement sufficient to give an identifiable series of resonant levels , and writing @xmath76 , ( [ eqn : phase ] ) predicts their energies as @xmath77 and corresponding widths @xmath78 where @xmath79 the `` hard - wall '' limit in this case is @xmath80 , which ensures that the wavefunction ( [ eqn : asympw ] ) vanishes at @xmath58 . in this limit ( [ eqn : levels2 ] )",
    "coincides with ( [ eqn : levels ] ) and @xmath81 so that once again the resonance widths are directly related to the inelastic @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering rates .    in reality , scattering at real steps has been found to be lossy , so that @xmath82 , and then ( [ eqn : gammar ] ) enables to be estimated the resulting additional contribution to the level width @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ fig : island ] shows widths found by solving ( [ eqn : phase ] ) for variously sized ag vacancy islands using an energy - dependent step reflection coefficient fitted to experimentally determined values @xcite , along with the widths expected using the approximate expression ( [ eqn : gammar ] ) .",
    "the agreement is again very good .",
    "the widths show similar behaviour to those in the atomic corrals , increasing approximately linearly with energy and inversely proportional to the island radius .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : gammac ] ) and ( [ eqn : gammar ] ) enable the ready determination of the lossy scattering contribution to the spectral linewidths of electron states in circular resonators . in terms of lifetime studies ,",
    "circular resonators have two distinct advantages .",
    "firstly , the high symmetry results in the sparsest spectrum , which simplifies the extraction of linewidths .",
    "this point is discussed more fully below .",
    "secondly , it is not generally possible to obtain an analytic expression for the spectral linewidths in the case of non - circular resonators . nevertheless , non - circular resonators are important , for example the atomic structure of the ( 111 ) surfaces favours the natural formation of triangular and hexagonal resonators .    figure [ fig : triangle ] shows the calculated linewidths due to lossy boundary scattering of electron    states with amplitude at the center of a 72 fe atom triangular corral on cu(111 ) , side @xmath84  .",
    "an analytic treatment for this geometry is not possible , and so these widths have been obtained by fitting a series of lorenzians to the local density of states which is obtained by numerically evaluating the green function using equations [ eqn : g0pg0tg0],[eqn : eom ] .",
    "the resonant levels occur at energies that are close to those of the hard wall limit , @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 integer.@xcite also shown in the figure is the linewidth relation ( equation ( [ eqn : gammac ] ) ) for _ circular _ corrals with radii @xmath89  , corresponding to the same area as the triangular corral , and @xmath90  , corresponding to the largest enclosed circle . in each case in evaluating ( [ eqn : omega ] ) we have used for @xmath51 , the linear density of corral atoms , the value from the actual triangular corral , @xmath91 .",
    "the widths in the same - area circular corral underestimate the triangular corral widths by some @xmath92 , but those for the inscribed circular corral provide a good description . calculations on other hexagonal and rectangular resonators confirm this result . the lossy scattering contribution to the level widths at the center of non - circular resonators are approximately given by the appropriate circular resonator width relation ( [ eqn : gammac ] ) or ( [ eqn : gammar ] ) , using for the radius that of the largest enclosed circle .",
    "therefore when _ designing _ potential resonator structures for lifetime studies , lossy - boundary scattering effects can be estimated using these expressions , although more detailed calculations taking into account the actual geometry are needed for subsequent _ quantitative _ analysis of experimental spectra .",
    "for completeness , we note that in addition to the lossy - scattering contribution , the experimental linewidth also includes contributions due to instrumental and thermal effects .",
    "these must also be borne in mind when considering the use of resonators for lifetime determinations .",
    "the thermal broadening is induced by the temperature dependence of the fermi - dirac distribution function,@xcite which enters via the requirement that electrons tunnel in sts from occupied states in the tip / sample to unoccupied states in the sample / tip .",
    "the effect on the differential conductivity is to convolute with the derivative of the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath93 the thermal broadening function shown in figure [ fig : broaden ]    has a fwhm of @xmath94 .",
    "this is a relatively small contribution at low temperatures ( = @xmath95 at @xmath96 ) .",
    "the differential conductivity is normally measured using a lock - in technique , which reduces phase - incoherent noise contributions .",
    "@xcite a sinusoidal voltage modulation @xmath97 is superimposed upon the tunneling voltage @xmath9 , and the signal at frequency @xmath98 recorded : @xmath99 the measured voltage is the differential conductivity convoluted with the instrumental function @xmath100 , @xmath101 the fwhm of this instrumental broadening function @xmath100 , shown in figure [ fig : broaden ] , is @xmath102 .",
    "the results of the previous sections permit the design and use of resonator structures for the measurement of intrinsic lifetimes . to illustrate this , we consider circular atomic corrals constructed from    ag adatoms on ag(111 ) , for which a scattering phaseshift @xmath103 has been measured .",
    "@xcite the basic idea is that resonators with different dimensions result in different series of energy levels , at energies given by ( [ eqn : levels ] ) ( or more accurately by numerically solving ( [ eqn : cond ] ) ) . by choosing an appropriate radius @xmath58 , levels can be positioned at specific energies @xmath104 . using sts to measure the corresponding level width @xmath105 , equations ( [ eqn : gammatot ] ) and ( [ eqn : gammac ] ) plus knowledge of the thermal and instrumental broadening effects ( section [ sec : experiment ] )",
    "may then be used to identify @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ fig : agcorral ] compares theoretical estimates for the intrinsic many - body widths of the ag(111 ) shockley surface state with the boundary - loss contributions @xmath107 that arise in variously - sized circular corrals . for the smallest corral of radius @xmath108 nm @xmath56 ( squares )",
    "is significantly greater than @xmath109 ( solid line ) for most energies . in practice",
    "this will make harder the accurate determination of @xmath109 and hence lifetimes @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) from sts - measured linewidths , which will be the sum of @xmath109 and @xmath56 , plus the effects of the convolution with @xmath112 ( [ eqn : chit ] ) and @xmath100 ( [ eqn : chim ] ) . in the 20 nm radius corral the intrinsic and boundary - loss linewidth contributions are comparable for most energies , making it a better candidate structure for intrinsic lifetime determinations .",
    "one might consider going further , noting that for a fixed linear density of atoms making up the corral , @xmath113 , the linewidth @xmath56 decreases linearly with @xmath58 , encouraging the use of corrals of even greater radius . for almost all energies the lossy - scattering contribution @xmath56 in the 30 nm corral shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : agcorral ] is smaller than the intrinsic linewidth @xmath109 .",
    "however , from ( [ eqn : levels ] ) we see that the level spacings vary as @xmath114 , decreasing with radius more rapidly than @xmath56 , so that in larger corrals the resonances merge , and the levels lose their integrity .",
    "this is already apparent at low energies in the 20 nm corral .",
    "the ldos for this case is presented in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : agcorral ] , and shows that the lowest two levels are only just separated . if typical thermal and instrumental broadenings are included , then the lowest level becomes an indiscernable shoulder .",
    "hence lifetimes @xmath115 are best measured in ag adatom corrals with radii up to @xmath116 nm , with smaller resonators used for lifetimes at energies towards the bottom of the band of surface states .",
    "we conclude by summarising the main results of this work .",
    "we have derived analytic expressions for the contribution to the spectral linewidths of electronic states measured using scanning tunneling spectroscopy at the centre of circular atomic corrals and adatom and vacancy islands that arises due to lossy boundary - scattering . correcting measured linewidths for these contributions as well as thermal and instrumental broadening effects enables intrinsic linetimes due to electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering to be determined .",
    "the expressions that we have obtained are straightforward to evaluate , and also provide an estimate of lossy - confinement effects in non - circular resonators where the relevant radius is that of the largest enclosed circle . using our linewidth expressions it is possible to design resonator structures appropriate for lifetime studies .",
