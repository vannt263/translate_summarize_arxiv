    "the study of the hadron - quark phase transition at high density is of great interest in both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "it has been pointed out by glendenning  @xcite that the hadron - quark phase transition in neutron stars may proceed through a mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter over a finite range of pressures and densities according to the gibbs criteria for phase equilibrium .",

    "it is believed that hyperons may appear around twice normal nuclear matter density through the weak interaction  @xcite , which usually occur earlier than the hadron - quark phase transition .",
    "the inclusion of hyperons in the hadronic phase alters the threshold density and properties of the mixed phase significantly . in general",
    ", the presence of new degrees of freedom , such as hyperons and quarks , tends to soften the equation of state ( eos ) at high density and lower the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "to study the hadron - quark phase transition , we need models to describe hadronic matter and quark matter . unfortunately , there is no single model which can be used to describe both phases and the dynamic process of the phase transition .",
    "we have to use different approaches for the description of the two phases , then perform the glendenning construction for the charge - neutral mixed phase where both hadronic and quark phases coexist  gl92 . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory to describe the hadronic matter phase , while the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model is used for the quark matter phase .",
    "the choice of the njl model is motivated by the fact that this model can successfully reproduce many aspects of quantum chromodynamics such as the nonperturbative vacuum structure and dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",

    "we need not only the eos at high density for the interior region but also the eos for the inner and outer crusts , where the density is low and heavy nuclei exist . for the nonuniform matter at low density , we adopt a relativistic eos based on the rmf theory with a local density approximation  @xcite .",
    "the nonuniform matter is modelled to be composed of a lattice of spherical nuclei immersed in an electron gas with or without free neutrons dripping out of nuclei .",
    "as the density increases , heavy nuclei dissolve and the optimal state is a uniform matter consisting of neutrons , protons , and leptons ( electrons and muons ) in @xmath11 equilibrium .",
    "the low density eos is therefore matched to an eos of uniform nuclear matter at around @xmath12 g/@xmath13  @xcite . at higher densities ,",
    "some additional degrees of freedom such as hyperons and quarks may occur , and the hadron - quark phase transition could proceed through a mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter  @xcite . applying the eos of neutron star matter over a wide density range , we study the neutron star properties by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation , and examine whether or not the deconfined quark phase can exist in the core of neutron stars .",
