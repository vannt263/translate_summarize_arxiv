    "100 years ago , albert einstein presented to the world his theory of general relativity ( gr ) which is said that space and time are not absolute , but can be distorted or warped by matter .",
    "einstein s genius was in his willingness to confront the contradictions between different branches of physics by questioning assumptions so basic that nobody else saw them as assumptions .",
    "one prediction of the gr is that in particular , a cataclysmic event such as the collapse of a star could send shock waves through space , gravitational waves ( gws),discovered and announced in february 2016 by ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ) @xcite .",
    "the gws the other proposal that matter can warp space and time leads to many other predictions , notably that light passing a massive body will appear bent to a distant observer , whereas time will appear stretched .",
    "each of these phenomena has been observed ; the bending of distant starlight by the sun was first observed in 1919 , and the synchronization of clocks in gps satellites with earthbound clocks has to take account of the fact that clocks on earth are in a strong gravitational field .",
    "another prediction of gr is that if enough matter is concentrated in a small volume , the space in its vicinity will be so warped that it will curve in on itself to the extent that even light can not escape@xcite .",
    "astronomical observations suggest that each galaxy has a super massive black hole ( bh ) at its centre@xcite . mind - blowing concepts wormholes ( whs ) can be considered his last prediction , which is also known as einstein",
    " rosen bridge@xcite .",
    "it is a short - cut connecting two separate points in spacetime .",
    "moreover , gr is used as a basis of nowadays most prominent cosmological models@xcite .",
    "einstein s equations start to break down in the singularities of bhs . before going to study deeply bhs and whs ,",
    "lets shortly review the gr .",
    "the gr is the  einstein s theory of gravity and it is a set of non - linear partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "the einstein field equations are @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the newton constant , @xmath2 is a einstein tensor and @xmath3 is a energy momentum tensor , which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress ( that is , pressure and shear ) , which must satisfy the relation of @xmath4 .",
    "this relation can be called as the equation of motion for the matter fields . furthermore , the einstein tensor @xmath2 is also divergence free @xmath5 noted that the einstein tensor @xmath2 is @xmath6where @xmath7 is called the ricci tensor @xcite @xmath8the ricci scalar of curvature scalar @xmath9 is the contraction of the ricci tensor.@xmath10where  the christoffel symbols @xmath11 are defined by @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the inverse of the metric function and it is the main ingredient of the einstein field equations .",
    "gr is based on two important postulates .",
    "the first one is the principle of special relativity .",
    "the second one is the equivalence principle .",
    "einstein s ` newton s apple ' which in sighted to gravitation was the equivalence principle .",
    "as an example , consider two elevators one is at rest on the earth and the other is accelerating in space . inside the elevator",
    "suppose that there is no windows so it is impossible to realize the difference between gravity and acceleration .",
    "thus , it gives the same results as observed in uniform motion unaffected by gravity .",
    "in addition , gravity bends light in which a photon crossing the elevator accelerating into space , the photon appears to fall downward .",
    "a bh is an object that is so compact that its gravitational force is strong enough to prevent light or anything else from escaping .",
    "it has a singularity where all the matter in it is squeezed into a region of infinitely small volume .",
    "there is an event horizon  which is an imaginary sphere that measures how close to the singularity you can safely get@xcite .    by far the most important solution in this case",
    "is that discovered by karl schwarzschild , which describes spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes .",
    "the fact that the schwarzschild metric is not just a good solution , but is the unique spherically symmetric vacuum solution , is known as birkhoff s theorem .",
    "it only has a mass , but no electric charge , and no spin .",
    "karl schwarzschild discovered this bh geometry at the close of 1915@xcite , within weeks of einstein presenting his final theory of gr .",
    "real bhs are likely to be more complicated than the schwarzschild geometry : real bhs probably spin , and the ones that astronomers see are not isolated , but are feasting on material from their surroundings .",
    "the no - hair theorem states that the geometry outside ( but not inside ! ) the horizon of an isolated bh is characterized by just three quantities : mass , electric charge , spin .",
    "bhs are thus among the simplest of all nature s creations .",
    "when a bh first forms from the collapse of the core of a massive star , it is not at all a no - hair bh .",
    "rather , the newly collapsed bh wobbles about , radiating gws .",
    "the gws carry away energy , settling the bh towards a state where it can no longer radiate .",
    "this is the no - hair state .    in this thesis",
    ", we will use some of the exact solution of the einstein field equations to construct whs and thin - shells . in gr ,",
    "birkhoff s theorem states that any spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum field equations must be static and asymptotically flat .",
    "this means that the exterior solutions ( i.e. the spacetime outside of a spherical , non - rotating , gravitating body ) must be given by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "@xmath14 noted that it is singular at @xmath15to see that this is a true singularity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "one such important quantity is the kretschmann scalar , which is given by @xmath16 note that schwarzschild solution has those properties : spherically symmetric , static , coordinates adapted to the time - like killing vector field @xmath17 , time - symmetric and time translation invariant , a hyper - surface - orthogonal time - like killing vector field @xmath18 , asymptotically flat and geometric mass @xmath19 .",
    "wormholes ( whs ) is a hypothetical connection between widely separated regions of space ",
    "time @xcite .",
    "although flamm s work on the wh physics dates back to 1916 , in connection with the newly found schwarzschild solution @xcite , wh solutions were firstly considered from physics standpoint by einstein and rosen ( er ) in 1935 , which is known today as er bridges connecting two identical sheets @xcite . then in 1955 wheeler",
    "used `` geons '' ( self - gravitating bundles of electromagnetic fields ) by giving the first diagram of a doubly - connected - space @xcite .",
    "wheeler added the term `` wormhole '' to the physics literature , however he defined it at the quantum scale .",
    "after that , first traversable wh was proposed by morris - thorne in 1988 morris .",
    "then morris , thorne , and yurtsever investigated the requirements of the energy condition for whs @xcite .",
    "after while , visser constructed a technical way to make thin - shell whs which thoroughly surveyed the research landscape as of 1988 @xcite .",
    "after this , there are many papers written to support this idea @xcite .",
    "whs are existed in the theory of gr , which is our best description of the universe .",
    "but experimentally there is no  evidence and no one has any idea how they would be created .",
    "[ fig : wormhole ]      a wh is any compact region on the space time without any singularity , however with a mouth to allow entrance@xcite .",
    "firstly one considers an interesting exotic spacetime metric and solves the einstein field equation , then finds the exotic matter  needed as a source responsible for the respective geometry .",
    "it is needed the exotic matter which violates the null energy condition,@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a null vector .",
    "it also violates the causality by allowing closed time - like curves .",
    "furthermore , the other interesting outcome is that time travel is possible without excess the speed of light .",
    "those outcomes are based on theoretical solutions and useful for gedanken - experiments . as it is well known the casimir effect",
    "has similar features that violates this condition in nature@xcite .",
    "now , lets give an example of a traversable wh metric which is given by @xmath22 the first defined traversable wh is morris thorne wh@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the red - shift function  ( the lapse function )  that change in frequency of electromagnetic radiation in gravitational field and @xmath25 is the shape function . at @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the 2-curved surface is embedded into 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath28to be a solution of a wh , one needs to impose that the geometrical throat flares out conditions , the minimality of the wormhole throat , which are given by @xcite @xmath29 with new radial coordinate @xmath30 ( proper distance ) , while @xmath31@xmath32although there is a coordinate singularity where the metric coefficient @xmath33 diverges at the throat , the proper radial distance which runs from @xmath34 to @xmath35can be redefined as @xmath36 * properties of the metric : *    -no event horizons ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) ,    -@xmath24 must be finite everywhere ,    - spherically symmetric and static : static means that the metric does not change over time and irrotate , on the other way , stationary spacetime means that the metric does not change in time , however it can rotate .",

    "wh , we study 2 copies of a 2 + 1-dimensional background spacetime given .",
    "these copies are used at a radius @xmath566 , where the throat of the wh will be located larger than the event horizon .",
    "all steps for thin - shell by using the isreal junction conditions are also valid for the constructing of wh , only difference appears when  calculating the energt density and pressure of wh .",
    "then we have the jump if the extrinsic curvature components at the surface @xmath189 , furthermore , we take the @xmath567 and also @xmath568 for the wh case , and calculate associated linear energy density and pressure for wh .",

    "it is now interesting to reduce our general results to some specific examples . such as rotating ads - btz thinshell wh and rotating btz thinshell wh .",
    "our last wh example is on very recent work where they introduce a counter rotating thin shell whs as follows @xcite . in @xmath415 and @xmath583 the spacetimes",
    "are given by rotating btz whose line elements are written as with @xmath584  which are the rotating btz .",

    "after some calculations , the energy density and the pressures is calculated as@xmath594and @xmath595 the static case where @xmath242 and @xmath243 ) @xmath596and @xmath597 we  have already imposed a generic potential equation in eq.([veffwh ] ) .",

    "in this thesis , we have studied the stability of thin - shells around the bhs and the stability of the thin - shell whs .",
    "firstly , we have introduced generally the bhs , whs and their properties in the theory of the gr .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the hawking radiation from the traversable whs . in chapter 2 , we have studied the rotating thin - shells methods and gave some examples .",
    "especially , the bardeen bh with a charged thin - shell is used to produce thin - shell matching inside and outside .",
    "we have created the thin - shell by using the israel junction conditions which we derived earlier .",
    "then as a result of the thin - shell , the effect of the charge is disappeared to outside . moreover , we have checked the stability regions of the thin - shell and we have plotted the areas of the stability . experimentally , there is a possibility that thin - shells can cancel the charge s effects for the outside observers .",
    "our example is in the 2 + 1 dimensions but it can be found similar effects for the higher dimensions .    in chapter 3 , we have defined the methods of the constructing thin - shell whs and we have studied two example of thin - shell whs in 2 + 1 dimensions and 3 + 1 dimensions by using same method which is gluing two copies of bulks via the cut and paste procedure . to this end , we have used the fact that the radius of throat must be greater than the event horizon of the metric given : ( @xmath609 ) .",
    "we have adopted lbg , cg , gcg , and logg gas equation of states to the exotic matter locating at the throat .",
    "then , the stability analysis has become the study of checking positivity of the second derivative of an effective potential at the throat radius @xmath444 : @xmath610 . in all cases ,",
    "we have managed to find the stability regions in terms of the throat radius @xmath444 and constant parameter @xmath611 , which are associated with the eos employed .",
    "hence , in our studies the exotic matter is needed to support construction of the throat of the thin - shell .    in last section",
    ", we have studied the rotating thin - shell whs in 2 + 1-dimensions .",
    "this time we use the counterrotating shells around the throat which has no effect on the gluing procedure and lanczos energy conditions .",
    "it can be thought that the upper and lower pressures cancel each others and leaving no cross terms of the pressure component .",
    "stability of a counterrotating tsw for a gas of linear equation of state turns out to make the tsw more stable . for very fast rotation",
    "the stability region grows much larger in the parameter space . for a velocity dependent perturbation",
    ", however , it is shown that tsw is no more stable .",
    "that is , perturbation of the throat radius ( @xmath612 ) that depends on initial speed ( @xmath613 ) , no matter how small , does nt return to the equilibrium radius @xmath612 again . although our work is confined to the simple @xmath614dimensional spacetime it is our belief that similar behaviours are exhibited also by the higher dimensional tsws . however , even for the @xmath615dimensional spacetime cases it is not easy task to check the stability because there are more degrees of freedom in @xmath615 dimensional spacetime .",
