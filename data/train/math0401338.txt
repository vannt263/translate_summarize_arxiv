    "the theorem of lutz and martinet  @xcite asserts that any closed , oriented @xmath1-manifold @xmath6 admits a contact structure in each homotopy class of tangent @xmath7-plane fields . here",
    "fields are understood to be cooriented ; a _ contact structure _ is understood to be cooriented and positive , that is , a @xmath7-plane field @xmath8 defined as the kernel of a global @xmath9-form @xmath10 on @xmath6 such that @xmath11 is a positive volume form .",
    "the cited paper by martinet only covers the existence of _ some _ contact structure on a given  @xmath6 ; for a proof of the existence of such a structure in every homotopy class of @xmath7-plane fields see  @xcite , which gives a proof of that result along the lines of the original ( and never fully published ) argument by lutz .",
    "the key to that second step is what is nowadays known as a _ lutz twist _ , a surgery on a knot @xmath0 in a given contact manifold @xmath12  with @xmath0 _ transverse _ to  @xmath8",
    " that is topologically trivial ( i.e. , does not change  @xmath6 ) , but transforms @xmath8 to a contact structure @xmath13 in a different homotopy class of @xmath7-plane fields .    in a series of papers  @xcite",
    "we described a notion of contact @xmath14-surgery on _ legendrian _ knots in a contact manifold ( that is , knots tangent to the given contact structure ) , where @xmath15 denotes the framing of the surgery relative to the natural contact framing of the legendrian knot .",
    "this generalises the contact surgery introduced by eliashberg  @xcite and weinstein  @xcite , which in our language is a contact @xmath16-surgery . amongst other things",
    ", we discussed explicit surgery diagrams for various contact manifolds and gave an alternative proof of the lutz - martinet theorem via such legendrian surgeries . we did not , however , fully elucidate the relation between our surgery diagrams and the lutz twist ( although the principal connection was described in  @xcite , cf .",
    "the intention of the present note is to give an explicit legendrian surgery diagram for the lutz twist . in particular , this yields surgery representations for all contact structures on @xmath17 analogous to  @xcite and provides concrete realisations for the considerations in section  6 of  @xcite .",
    "we shall henceforth assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of this notion of contact surgery ; if not , the best place to start may well be  @xcite , cf .  also  @xcite .",
    "one fact from  @xcite we should like to recall here is that contact @xmath4-surgery is the inverse of contact @xmath16-surgery .",
    "we briefly recall the definition of the lutz twist , cf .",
    "let @xmath0 be a knot transverse to a contact structure @xmath8 on a @xmath1-manifold @xmath6 .",
    "then there is a tubular neighbourhood @xmath18 of @xmath0 that is contactomorphic to the solid torus @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 denoting the @xmath7-disc of radius  @xmath21 ) for some suitable @xmath22 , with contact structure @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath25-coordinate , and @xmath26 are polar coordinates on @xmath20 .",
    "for ease of notation we identify @xmath27 with @xmath28 .    a _ simple lutz twist _ along",
    "@xmath0 is the operation that replaces the contact structure @xmath8 on @xmath6 by the one that coincides with @xmath8 outside @xmath18 , and on @xmath19 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30\\rightarrow{{\\mathbb { r}}}$ ] are smooth functions satisfying the following conditions :    * @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath14 near @xmath33 , * @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath14 near @xmath21 , * @xmath36 is never parallel to @xmath37  in particular , neither of them is ever equal to ( 0,0 ) ",

    "the contact structure @xmath40 is a so - called _ overtwisted _ contact structure in the sense of eliashberg  @xcite , and as shown in that paper ( specifically , theorem  3.1.1 ) , the classification of such overtwisted contact structures up to isotopy fixed near the boundary coincides with the classification of @xmath7-plane fields up to homotopy rel boundary .",
    "an immediate consequence of that classification is that the contact structure on @xmath6 obtained from @xmath8 by a lutz twist along @xmath0 is ( up to isotopy ) independent of any of the choices in the construction described above .",
    "let @xmath12 be a given contact @xmath1-manifold and @xmath0 a knot in @xmath6 transverse to @xmath8 . in order to describe a legendrian link @xmath5 in @xmath6 such that @xmath4-contact surgery on @xmath5 has the same effect as a lutz twist along @xmath0",
    ", we may assume by  @xcite that @xmath12 has been obtained from @xmath17 with its standard contact structure @xmath44 by contact @xmath45-surgery on a legendrian link in @xmath46 , and thus can be represented by the front projection ( to the @xmath47-plane ) of this legendrian link , considered as a link in @xmath48 with its standard contact structure @xmath49 , which is contactomorphic to @xmath46 with a point removed .",
    "for the representation of legendrian and transverse knots via their front projection we refer to @xcite .",
    "beware that these three papers use three different conventions for writing the standard contact structure on @xmath48 .",
    "we follow the one from @xcite ( which is also that of  @xcite ) .",
    "the positive transversality condition @xmath50 for a curve @xmath51 implies that in the front projection of a positively transverse knot there can be no vertical tangencies going downwards ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , and all but the crossing shown in figure  [ figure : transverse - not ] are possible .    from these front projections",
    "it is easy to describe the positive transverse push - off of an oriented legendrian knot : smooth the up - cusps and replace the down - cusps by kinks ( there is only one possibility for the sign of the crossing in this kink ) .",
    "similarly , one can easily describe an oriented legendrian knot whose positive transverse push - off is a given transverse knot , cf .",
    "@xcite :    * in the front projection of the given transverse knot ( oriented positively ) , replace vertical ( upwards ) tangencies by cusps . * by figure  [ figure : transverse - not ] , in those crossings of a positively transverse knot that can not be interpreted as the front projection of a legendrian knot , at least one of the strands is pointing up @xmath54 ) .",
    "if one adds a zigzag to that strand ( if both are going up , either can be chosen ) , it is possible to realise the given crossing by the front projection of a legendrian curve .",
    "[ thm ] let @xmath3 be an oriented legendrian knot in @xmath12 , represented by the front projection of a legendrian knot in @xmath55 disjoint from the link describing @xmath12 .",

    "let @xmath13 be the contact structure on @xmath6 obtained from @xmath8 by contact @xmath4-surgery on both @xmath3 and @xmath56 , and @xmath57 the contact structure obtained from @xmath8 by a simple lutz twist along the positive transverse push - off @xmath0 of  @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath13 and @xmath57 are isotopic via an isotopy fixed outside a tubular neighbourhood of  @xmath3 .",
    "the proof of this theorem proceeds as follows : first of all , we verify that the described surgeries on @xmath3 and @xmath56 taken together do not change the manifold @xmath6 . secondly , we check that the resulting contact structure is overtwisted by exhibiting an explicit overtwisted disc . then , again by eliashberg s classification of overtwisted contact structures , and thanks to the fact that the two surgeries only change the contact structure in a tubular neighbourhood of  @xmath3 ( which contains the overtwisted disc just mentioned ) , it suffices to show that the described surgeries and the corresponding lutz twist have the same effect on the homotopy class of the contact structure , regarded as a mere plane field .",
    "\\(1 ) recall that contact @xmath14-surgery on a legendrian knot @xmath58 means that topologically we perform surgery with coefficient @xmath15 relative to the contact framing of @xmath58 , which is determined by a vector field along @xmath58 transverse to the contact structure . in the front projection picture",
    "this corresponds to pushing @xmath58 in @xmath59-direction , and it is this what we mean by _ the _ legendrian push - off of  @xmath58 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , contact @xmath4-surgery along @xmath58 and contact @xmath16-surgery along its legendrian push - off cancel each other , and in particular do not change the underlying manifold . since adding two zigzags to a legendrian knot adds two negative twists to its contact framing , we see that topologically the two contact @xmath4-surgeries on @xmath3 and @xmath56 are the same as a contact @xmath4-surgery along @xmath3 and a @xmath16-surgery along its legendrian push - off , and hence topologically trivial .    we can easily see this directly : write @xmath60 for the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath3 , so that the linking number between @xmath3 and its legendrian push - off ( or with @xmath56 ) is given by @xmath61 . then the topological framings ( i.e. , framings relative to the surface framing ) of the surgeries are @xmath62 and @xmath63 . after a handle slide ( cf .",
    "* chapter  5 ) ) we may replace the link @xmath64 by @xmath65 , with linking number @xmath66 and framing of @xmath67 equal to @xmath68 by construction , @xmath67 is an unknot , and the computation above shows that it is a @xmath33-framed meridian of @xmath3 , which proves the claim that the composition of the two surgeries is topologically trivial .",
    "\\(2 ) we next exhibit the overtwisted disc in the manifold obtained by the contact surgeries along @xmath3 and @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the knot indicated in figure  [ figure : lutz ] , i.e. , the legendrian push - off of @xmath3 with one additional zigzag and with one extra negative linking with @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath56 may be regarded as the legendrian push - off of @xmath69 with one additional zigzag .",
    "the surface framing of @xmath56 determined by the seifert surface of the oriented link @xmath70 indicated in figure  [ figure : lutz ] is equal to @xmath71 ( the contact framing of  @xmath69 ) , hence equal to the topological framing used for the surgery on  @xmath56 .",
    "so that seifert surface glued to the meridional disc used for the surgery on @xmath56 defines a disc with boundary @xmath69 in the surgered manifold .",
    "the surface framing of @xmath69 determined by that disc equals the contact framing @xmath71 , which is exactly the condition for an overtwisted disc .",
    "the above verification that @xmath69 is the boundary of an overtwisted disc in the surgered manifold is completely straightforward .",
    "nonetheless , it may be instructive to see that @xmath69 is not found by accident .",
    "start with a meridian @xmath72 to both @xmath3 and @xmath56 , that is , an unknot with @xmath73 .",
    "if surgery along @xmath3 and @xmath56 has any chance of being a lutz twist , we expect @xmath72 to be isotopic to the boundary of an overtwisted disc .",
    "there is an obvious pair of pants with boundary the oriented link @xmath74 that gives @xmath72 the surface framing @xmath75 and @xmath76 the framing @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "now perform a handle slide of @xmath78 over the @xmath7-handle attached to @xmath3 ( corresponding to the surgery ) to form , in the surgered manifold , the knot @xmath79 , which is the knot @xmath69 from above .",
    "we compute the linking numbers @xmath80 and the surface framing of @xmath79 , now with respect to the annulus with boundary @xmath81 : @xmath82 which is exactly what we had found for @xmath69 before .",
    "\\(3 ) it remains to be shown that the topological effect of the surgeries described in the theorem has the same effect on the homotopy class of the contact structure ( regarded merely as a plane field ) as a lutz twist . by the neighbourhood theorem for legendrian submanifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the particular nature of @xmath3 is irrelevant for this consideration .",
    "it therefore suffices to consider specific examples for @xmath3 , where the effect of the surgeries on the obstruction classes determining the homotopy type of the plane field can be computed explicitly .    for the following considerations cf .",
    "the tangent bundle of the solid torus @xmath83 being trivial , ( cooriented ) tangent @xmath7-plane fields on @xmath83 can be identified with maps @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the obstructions to homotopy of @xmath7-plane fields on @xmath83 rel boundary @xmath85 are in @xmath86 and @xmath87 the first obstruction corresponds to the extension of a given @xmath7-plane field along @xmath85 over a meridional disc of the solid torus and is detected by the ( relative ) first chern class of the plane field ( here the absence of @xmath7-torsion is crucial ) .",
    "the second obstruction relates to the extension of the plane field over the @xmath1-cell one needs to attach to @xmath88 ( meridional disc ) to form the solid torus .",
    "this obstruction is captured by the hopf invariant .",
    "( 3a ) in order to deal with the first obstruction , we consider @xmath89 with its standard tight contact structure @xmath90 , in obvious notation , and take @xmath3 to be an oriented legendrian knot in the homology class of @xmath91 .",
    "the contact manifold @xmath92 can be represented by contact @xmath4-surgery on a legendrian unknot @xmath93 with only two cusps , see  @xcite . for @xmath3",
    "we take another such unknot linked once with @xmath93 , and for @xmath56 its legendrian push - off with additional zigzags as in the theorem .",
    "write @xmath13 for the contact structure on @xmath6 obtained by performing contact @xmath4-surgery on @xmath3 and  @xmath56",
    ".    the contact structure @xmath8 has first chern class @xmath94 .",
    "this follows from the observation that the vector field @xmath95 defines a trivialisation of  @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , this is a consequence of the homological computations in section  3 of  @xcite , given the fact that the rotation number @xmath96 ( with any orientation on  @xmath93 ) , which can be computed from the front projection as @xmath97 , is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "in the sequel we assume that the reader is familiar with those homological computations .",
    "write @xmath98 for the meridional circles to @xmath76 , respectively , as well as the homology classes they represent in the homology of the surgered manifold . then , with @xmath99 denoting the poincar duality isomorphism from cohomology to homology , @xmath100 ( this would be true even if @xmath101 , since @xmath102 bounds a disc in @xmath6 also after the surgery . )    let @xmath103 be a legendrian push - off of @xmath3 . then the surgery along @xmath3 and @xmath56 may be assumed to occur in a tube containing @xmath3 and @xmath56 , but not @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that @xmath103 represents the same homology class in @xmath104 both before and after the surgery . since @xmath105 and along @xmath56 we perform surgery with topological framing @xmath71",
    ", we have that @xmath106 is homologically trivial in the surgered manifold . hence @xmath107=[l_1]\\in h_1(y),\\ ] ] so that @xmath108),\\ ] ] which is the same as for a lutz twist along the positive transverse push - off of @xmath3 ( i.e. , a transverse knot in the homology class of @xmath3 ) , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.15 ) .",
    "( 3b ) finally , in order to see that the effect that the surgery on the link @xmath110 has on the @xmath1-dimensional obstruction is the same as that of a lutz twist along a positive transverse push - off of @xmath3 , it is sufficient to consider an arbitrary oriented legendrian knot @xmath3 in @xmath46 .",
    "set @xmath111 , so that @xmath112 .",
    "as before we write @xmath60 for the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath3 , so that the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath56 equals @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the handlebody obtained from @xmath115 by attaching two @xmath7-handles corresponding to the two surgeries .",
    "let @xmath116 be the cohomology class that evaluates to @xmath117 on the surface in @xmath114 given by gluing a seifert surface ( with induced orientation ) of @xmath118 in @xmath115 with the core disc of the corresponding handle , @xmath119 .",
    "since we perform @xmath120 contact @xmath4-surgeries , corollary  3.6 of  @xcite tells us that the @xmath1-dimensional invariant of the contact structure @xmath13 obtained by these surgeries is given by @xmath121 the signature @xmath122 is the signature of the matrix @xmath123 , hence equal to @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , by that same formula we have @xmath124 . so the change in the @xmath125-invariant caused by the surgery is @xmath126 as shown in section  3 of  @xcite , @xmath127 can be computed as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the solution of @xmath130 this yields @xmath131 and @xmath132 , hence @xmath133 and finally @xmath134 .",
    "this is exactly minus the so - called self - linking number @xmath135 of the positive transverse push - off @xmath0 of @xmath3 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the relative @xmath125-invariant @xmath136 , measuring the obstruction to homotopy over the @xmath1-skeleton between @xmath44 and the contact structure @xmath57 obtained by a lutz twist along @xmath0 , equals @xmath135 .",
    "thus , to conclude the proof one would need to verify that the absolute @xmath125-invariant of @xcite and the relative @xmath125-invariant of @xcite are , in the case at hand , related by @xmath137    this can be done by looking at explicit geometric models , though , as always , it is difficult to keep track of signs .",
    "so here is a more roundabout algebraic argument .",
    "let @xmath138 be the contact structure obtained from @xmath44 by a lutz twist along a transverse knot @xmath139 with self - linking number @xmath140 ( this sign convention will be explained below ) ; recall that the self - linking number is independent of the orientation of the transverse knot . for any natural number @xmath141 , write @xmath142 for the contact structure on @xmath17 given by taking the connected sum of @xmath141 copies of @xmath143 .",
    "the additivity of the relative @xmath125-invariant implies @xmath144 , which means that we get a contact structure on @xmath17 in each homotopy class of tangent @xmath7-plane fields .",
    "these observations imply equation  ( [ eqn : d3 ] ) up to sign .",
    "we conclude @xmath147 by the considerations in ( 3a ) , we know that the extension of the contact structure over a meridional disc is the same , up to homotopy , for surgery on @xmath5 or lutz twist along  @xmath0 . from the fact that there are standard models for the tubular neighbourhood of a legendrian or transverse knot , respectively , we infer that @xmath148 and @xmath136 can only differ by a constant term independent of the specific knot ( corresponding to a different extension of the @xmath7-plane field over the @xmath1-cell attached to @xmath88 ( meridional disc ) ) .",
    "hence , the equation above can only hold if that constant is zero and the sign is the positive one . in turn , this yields equation  ( [ eqn : d3 ] ) in full generality .        if one defines @xmath56 by adding two down - zigzags instead of up - zigzags , in ( 3a ) one obtains @xmath151)$ ] .",
    "this is the same as for a lutz twist along the negative transverse push - off @xmath152 of @xmath3 , since @xmath152 with the orientation that makes it positively transverse to @xmath8 represents the class @xmath153 $ ] .",
    "similarly , with this @xmath56 we find in ( 3b ) that @xmath154 is equal to minus the self - linking number @xmath155 of the negative transverse push - off of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , this choice of @xmath56 amounts to performing a lutz twist along  @xmath152 .",
