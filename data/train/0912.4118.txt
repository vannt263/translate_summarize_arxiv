    "high cadence observations of astronomical sources is a growing field within astrophysics , and there is a clear need for such data for the sun .",
    "many research topics , in particular those related to the dynamic sun and the heating of its outer regions , involve the observation and modelling of wave phenomena and explosive events captured over very short timescales .",
    "high cadence observations are also important for post - facto image reconstruction ( pfir ) techniques which require the processing of an extensive collection of images for the production of a single frame at diffraction - limited resolution . these short exposure images must be accumulated over timescales sufficiently small so that atmospheric turbulence is effectively `` frozen out '' , and the solar features remain unchanged .",
    "since the discovery of solar oscillations in the 1960s @xcite , and their subsequent confirmation by , there has been a multitude of observational evidence presented verifying the widespread existence of oscillations in the solar atmosphere ( see the recent review by ) .",
    "oscillations throughout the solar atmosphere have enabled scientists to probe the underlying physics that are involved with energy transfer and coronal heating , and have been suggested as candidates to explain one of the main unanswered questions in solar physics ",
    "_ why is the outer solar atmosphere hotter than its surface ?",
    "_ however , in recent years a need to probe high - frequency oscillations has arisen .",
    "have shown that the energy contribution of high - frequency waves to atmospheric heating may be significant .",
    "furthermore , have indicated that quasi - periodic oscillations shorter than 100  s may be a vital mechanism in the creation of the multi - million degree solar corona .",
    "thus , a sensitive camera system with a suitably high cadence to satisfy the nyquist parameter is paramount for the study of high - frequency oscillations .",
    "such a system is not only capable of studying wave motion , but may also be utilized to examine highly dynamic phenomena in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "recently , fast - moving plasma with velocities exceeding 200  kms@xmath1 has been observed by , indicating the abundance of highly dynamic structures in the chromosphere .",
    "additional investigations may include the search for hard x - ray non - thermal electron precipitation sites in the event of flare activity .",
    "report short duration spikes associated with hard x - ray emission from solar flares , and in conjunction with the impact of fast - moving non - thermal electrons , leads to enhanced emission over inherently short time scales ( @xmath2  s ; ) .",
    "this , coupled with the detection of fast fluctuations of h@xmath3 emission from a flare kernel on timescales of @xmath4  s by , demonstrates the need for high - cadence solar imaging techniques to capture these dynamic processes on their intrinsic scales .",
    "the search for rapid , often low - amplitude intensity variations requires a highly sensitive camera system providing accurate , sustained frame rates , accompanied by good local seeing at the telescope facility .",
    "here we report the construction of a new high - speed camera system , developed by queen s university belfast ( qub ) , and its commissioning as a common - user instrument at the dunn solar telescope ( dst ) facility run by the national solar observatory in the sacramento peak mountains , new mexico , usa .",
    "this system , named _",
    "rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere _ ( rosa ) , will present users with the ability to observe the sun simultaneously in up to six wavelengths or wavebands . a detailed guide",
    "to rosa s hardware is described in section  [ instrumentation ] , while in section  [ observing ] a description of available observing modes is presented . in section  [ interface ] rosa s graphical user interface ( gui ) is explained , followed by guidelines for obtaining calibrated data in section  [ calibration ] . finally , concluding remarks , in addition to sample images from the instrument commissioning , are given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in the late 1990 s , a high - speed , two - camera solar imaging system named the _",
    "solar eclipse corona imaging system _ ( secis ; ) began development .",
    "this instrument was designed to rapidly capture images of the solar corona during a total eclipse and produced some very interesting results ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; ) . however , in order to image the lower solar atmosphere at high time resolution , a new camera system needed to be developed .",
    "the _ rapid dual imager _ ( rdi ; ) was designed as a followup to the highly successful secis camera system and consists of two 502  @xmath0  494 pixel@xmath5 ccds , operating at speeds of up to 20 frames per second .",
    "even with a relatively small number of pixels and onboard storage , rdi was able to show the need for a dedicated high - cadence multi - camera system ( see _ e.g. _ ) and acted as a pre - cursor to the capabilities possessed by rosa .",
    "the rosa system consists of six individual frame transfer ccds , each with their own dedicated server for data acquisition and storage .",
    "all cameras are triggered via a precision control unit or `` sync '' box .",
    "the ccd cameras are from andor technologies of belfast , with the du-885-vp model chosen comprising of a @xmath6 pixel@xmath7 area .",
    "they are cooled up to 100  @xmath8c below ambient temperature through use of a thermoelectric peltier cooler .",
    "maintaining low readout noise necessary for fast readout rates , each rosa camera can read out over 30 frames per second in full - chip mode and over 200 frames per second when the ccd is windowed .",
    "the ccd characteristics specific to the rosa system are presented in table  [ table1 ] and further described in section  [ emccd ] .",
    ".detailed description of rosa camera characteristics . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath9 : + @xmath10 : + @xmath11 : + @xmath12 : + @xmath13 : + @xmath14 : + @xmath15 : +",
    "rosa was successfully commissioned on the 76  cm dst during august 2008 ( fig  [ rosa_bench ] ) .",
    "it utilizes the dst s large optical benches and high - order adaptive optics to achieve multi - wavelength observations of the lower solar atmosphere . due to a wide range of optical components available",
    ", a large number of filter combinations can be achieved .",
    "however , details of several key optical elements are outlined here .    a zeiss universal birefringent filter ( ubf ; ) may be implemented for narrowband ( @xmath160.2   ) imaging . however , due to a significant decrease in the transmission profile of the ubf at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath17% at 4000   compared to @xmath18% at 7000   ; ) , it is more desirable to allow the ubf to obtain filtergrams in the `` red '' portion of the optical spectrum .",
    "typically , the ubf is most commonly used for chromospheric h@xmath3 core imaging at 6562.8   . however , in addition to optical imaging , the ubf may be used in conjunction with a wollaston prism to capture photospheric magnetic field information at high spatial and temporal resolution . by tuning the ubf into the wing of the magnetically sensitive fe   ( 6302.5   ) absorption line , two rosa cameras may be used to capture simultaneous stokes  v observations of left- and right - hand circularly polarized light , allowing the magnitude of the line - of - sight magnetic field component to be studied . if it is desirable to obtain magnetic - field information in the photosphere , simultaneous narrowband h@xmath3 core imaging can still be obtained using an additional tunable zeiss filter .    for imaging in the `` blue '' ,",
    "independent halle / oriel filters may be used which have a more efficient transmission curve for this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "examples include wideband continuum and g - band filters for photospheric imaging , as well as a calcium - k core filter for observations of the upper - photosphere / lower - chromosphere .",
    "typically , observers will choose to reduce the overall field - of - view size in exchange for higher spatial resolution . in order to do this",
    ", acquired images should have a sampling of @xmath160.07@xmath19 per pixel to match the telescope s diffraction - limited resolution in the `` blue '' portion ( _ e.g. _ @xmath20   ) of the optical spectrum to that of the ccd .",
    "doing so places @xmath21  km of the solar surface on each pixel , providing @xmath22  km spatial resolution and an overall field - of - view size of @xmath23  km@xmath7 . maintaining the same spatial sampling across all rosa cameras will insure the resulting data has the same field - of - view .",
    "however , users may choose to match the telescope s diffraction - limited resolution in each of their desired bandpasses to that of the ccd , thus providing optimal spatial resolution on all rosa cameras .",
    "details of the most common filters may be found in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "exposure times listed are typical of quiet - sun , disk - centre observations filling approximately one - third of the well depth per exposure . utilizing count rates obtained during the rosa commissioning run ( incorporating the default plate - scale sampling of 0.07@xmath19 per pixel ) and the camera s quantum efficiency curve ( upper panel of figure  [ qe_noise ] ) ,",
    "photon count - rate statistics can be derived , as listed in the fifth column of table  [ table2 ] .",
    "since rosa utilizes a host of independent computers and storage devices , it is not necessary to run all six cameras during a single observing sequence .",
    "indeed , any combination of cameras may be used depending on the observers scientific requirements .",
    "a user can individually adjust camera operating temperatures , frame rates and exposure times through use of a simple graphical user interface ( gui ; fig  [ gui ] ) .",
    "the gui utilizes a java - script interface to create a stable platform incorporating drop - down menus in an easy - to - follow environment . through the gui",
    ", users can also select which cameras to run , and modify their triggering sequence to maximize individual camera frame rates and insure the synchronization of specific cameras .",
    "the gui also allows the user to select which type of observations will be acquired by selecting the desired option .",
    "these options include solar data acquisition , dark images with a closed shutter , bias frames using a zero - second exposure time and flat field images .",
    "each choice will result in the saved filename being modified to include the desired option , thus making post - acquisition file searching much easier .",
    "once an observing sequence has commenced , the gui displays sample images coming from each of the cameras , refreshed approximately every second .",
    "a detailed description of the gui and a guide to its adjustable parameters may be found in the rosa user manual , available at .",
    "due to the high sensitivity of the rosa system , it is imperative to accompany data imaging sequences with a range of additional observations . it is these supplementary observations which allow accurately processed images to be produced via the rosa - specific data reduction pipeline . to compensate for dark current and read - out noise , sufficient dark images ( @xmath24 ) with exposure times equal to the data acquisition must be obtained and subtracted from the science images . many flat - field images ( @xmath25 ) should also be taken through an un - flat telescope mirror coupled to a random guider to allow an accurate gain table to be created for each rosa camera .",
    "these key calibration procedures will enable science data to be corrected for camera inconsistencies as well as for variable light levels across the incident beam . at this stage",
    ", pfir techniques such as speckle @xcite or multi - object multi - frame blind deconvolution @xcite may be implemented .",
    "indeed , have shown how modern pfir techniques can produce reconstructed images which are photometrically accurate , allowing reliable studies of solar structures to be undertaken .",
    "however , image reconstruction processes are extremely cpu intensive and this must be taken into consideration before attempting to reduce the data .",
    "for example , during the commissioning run a single rosa camera obtained over 105,000 raw g - band filtergrams in only one hour of observing . with excellent seeing conditions ,",
    "an image reconstruction of @xmath26 was deemed suitable , providing a reconstructed cadence of 0.5  s. thus , over 6500 separate reconstructions were required , with each individual process taking approximately 30  cpu  minutes to complete on a modern intel xeon processor . if access to only one computer is possible ( _ e.g. _ preparing the data solely on the user s desktop pc ) , then reconstructing all 6500 images would take in excess of 135  days , with additional time being required to process the data from the remaining five rosa cameras . as telescope schedules often grant individuals in excess of seven days observing time , and each day commonly provides @xmath27  hours of good seeing conditions , it is imperative to consider how and where the acquired observations will be reduced so excessive time delays are not experienced .    in order to co - align each rosa camera , additional calibration images should be acquired .",
    "images of an air - force target will allow compensation for general rotation and image mirroring , while acquiring a burst of grid images will enable small - scale inter - camera image rotation to be evaluated and removed .",
    "with these camera positioning artifacts removed , image destretching can be accomplished through use of the rosa data reduction pipeline . under normal circumstances , a @xmath28 grid , equating to a @xmath29 separation between spatial samples ( for diffraction - limited resolution at 4170   ) , is used to evaluate local offsets between successive images , allowing compensation for spatial distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence and/or air bubbles crossing the entrance aperture of the telescope .",
    "the fine destretching grid implemented in this process allows compensation for small - scale seeing conditions of @xmath30 to @xmath31 in size .    to help facilitate and expedite data preparation ,",
    "qub have developed a parallel processing cluster dedicated to rosa data reduction .",
    "this cluster consists of 25 intel xeon quad - core cpus providing 100 processing nodes on a dedicated private network .",
    "users of the rosa instrument may opt for all data reduction to be carried out on the qub cluster , or may avail of the freely distributed rosa pipeline for use on their own reduction cluster . the accurate reconstruction , co - alignment and destretching of multiple atmospheric heights will promote the use of multi - wavelength studies , whereby the cause of dynamic phenomena can be probed and analysed , with the subsequent effect on other layers of the solar atmosphere evaluated .",
    "in recent years , the solar community has expressed a strong desire for a high - cadence , synchronized , multi - camera system to be introduced which would allow unprecedented spatial _ and _ temporal resolutions of solar structures over a wide range of atmospheric heights . with the successful commissioning of the rosa instrument",
    ", it is now possible to observe solar structures at high cadences in up to six independent wavelengths simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ rosa_science ] shows the capabilities of observing in at least four synchronized wavelengths ( g - band filtergrams , magnetograms from circularly - polarized light at 6302.3   , ca - k core imaging at 3933.7   and narrowband h@xmath3 core filtergrams ) .",
    "these types of high - resolution images present an excellent opportunity to scientists , whereby magnetic structures can be investigated at multiple atmospheric heights with temporal resolutions exceeding ten frames per second .    due to the rack - mounted nature of the rosa instrument , future upgrades to the system",
    "can be readily carried out .",
    "as technology improves and the size of components decrease , rosa hardware can be updated continually to keep it at the forefront of high - cadence imaging .",
    "such upgrades will include the increased capacity of onboard storage , an improved connectivity for external media ( _ e.g. _ e - sata and firewire connections ) and a turbulence - reducing method of camera cooling ( _ e.g. _ via water cooling ) . with the presence of backside illuminated ccds now appearing in the marketplace , existing rosa cameras",
    "may be replaced with such devices . in instances where low exposure times are required ,",
    "this new breed of camera may lead to performance boosts in photon - starved regimes by offering a higher quantum efficiency when compared to traditional front - illuminated devices .",
    "the ability to adapt rosa with continually changing demands and computer architecture has identified rosa as a bridging instrument for the advanced technology solar telescope and places a high - cadence solar imager in line to become a first - light instrument on this revolutionary facility in 2015 .",
    "this work was supported by the u.k .",
    "science and technology facilities council and dbj wishes to thank the science and technology facilities council for the award of a post - doctoral fellowship .",
    "fpk is grateful to awe aldermaston for the award of a william penney fellowship .",
    "pjc thanks the northern ireland department for employment and learning for a phd studentship .",
    "observations were obtained at the national solar observatory , operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    "( aura ) , under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "finally we would like to thank the technical staff at the dst for perseverance in the face of seemingly endless camera and filter arrangements .",
