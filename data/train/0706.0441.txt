    "higgs bosons in representations of su(2)@xmath0 other than doublets occur in many extensions of the standard model . among these ,",
    "situations of special interest are created by su(2)@xmath0 triplet scalars which occur in various scenarios , ranging from left - right symmetric models to little higgs theories @xcite .",
    "complex scalar triplets with a hypercharge @xmath8 are particularly rich in this context in terms of their phenomenological implications .",
    "once we allow lepton number violation by two units , the complex triplet can couple to left - handed leptons in a gauge - invariant and renormalizable manner and give rise to majorana masses for neutrinos .",
    "no right - handed neutrinos need to be postulated in such a scenario . at the same time",
    ", the complex triplet contains a doubly charged component ( @xmath9 ) , and the same @xmath10 interactions with charged leptons open up a very spectacular set of decay channels for this state , namely , resonant decays into a pair of like - sign leptons .",
    "these channels not only lead to remarkably background - free signatures of the doubly charged scalars , but also demonstrate a crucial link between observations at high energy colliders and the widely discussed mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
    "we explore such a link in this paper , in the context of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "although the general idea is simple here and has been discussed earlier in different connections , including direct experimental searches at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , a number of subtle and challenging issues invariably come up in such a study , and we have done our best to address them .    first of all , the presence of a @xmath11 triplet @xmath12 allows the following @xmath10 interaction with left - handed lepton doublets @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the charge conjugation operator . in general",
    ", the triplet can develop a vacuum expectation value ( vev , @xmath15 ) .",
    "it thus contributes to @xmath16 majorana masses for the neutrinos , proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the current observations from the neutrino oscillation experiments and cosmological bounds yield @xcite @xmath18 this implies a stringent bound on @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath19 to be as small as the electron s yukawa coupling , we have @xmath20 mev . as for any @xmath16 interactions , neutrinoless double beta decay experiments ( @xmath21 )",
    "@xcite provide a direct test .",
    "@xmath9 also contributes to @xmath21 via @xmath22 the @xmath23 coupling is proportional to @xmath24 in the model under discussion , and with the @xmath21 bound @xcite , we have @xmath25 given the neutrino mass requirement in eq .",
    "( [ yvev ] ) , we obtain a bound @xmath26 , which is too weak to be relevant here .",
    "in fact , there is another direct bound on @xmath15 due to the electroweak @xmath27-parameter . in order to prevent large tree - level contributions to the @xmath27-parameter",
    ", one needs @xcite @xmath28 although models exist in the literature @xcite , where one has complex as well as real triplets , whose combined contributions to the @xmath27-parameter cancel , thus allowing large triplet vevs at the tree level , they presuppose the existence of additional symmetries whose validity is not clear once higher order effects involving gauge couplings are included .",
    "it is also to be noted that , if @xmath15 is allowed to be close to the upper limit from the @xmath27-parameter , then the couplings @xmath29 are forced to be @xmath30 .",
    "since there are six of these couplings ( assuming the matrix to be real symmetric ) , they all need to be adjusted within such a small range in order to reproduce the neutrino mass matrix that fits the observed mixing pattern .",
    "this makes the scenario rather more fine - tuned than one in which one has a much smaller @xmath15 a single quantity ) , along with the six parameters @xmath29 which are allowed to be closer to unity . in this phenomenological study",
    ", we will assume a small @xmath15 and be guided for the parameters by the neutrino mass generation , to saturate the relation of eq .",
    "( [ yvev ] ) .",
    "secondly , we wish to identify the leading production channels for the doubly charged higgs at the lhc .",
    "rather encouraging predictions about single production of the doubly charged higgs boson in @xmath31-boson fusion can be found in some earlier studies via the process @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , specific features of models are often utilized in such studies , and it is difficult to maintain such optimism in a general case if the triplet vev is restricted to a smaller value . numerically , the signal rate is proportional to @xmath33 and is already too small to be observable at the lhc if @xmath34 gev .",
    "since we are considering even smaller values of @xmath15 , we therefore concentrate instead on pair production which is largely governed by electromagnetic interactions . in principle , the production of one doubly - charged higgs in conjunction with a singly charged one , followed by the decay @xmath35 , driven by the @xmath36 gauge coupling , can generate additional signals @xcite . however , this presupposes considerable mass separation between the @xmath9 and the @xmath37 , which may not be quite expected in many scenarios such as those based on little higgs theories .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the pair production process as the constantly available fall - back , and remember that the doubly charged scalars produced most copiously in the drell - yan ( dy ) channel . in our analysis , we also include the production via the two - photon fusion channel .",
    "this is motivated by the stronger electromagnetic coupling of a doubly charged particle .",
    "comparing with a singly charged scalar , the two - photon channel will have an enhancement factor of 16 .",
    "numerically , it provides about 10 per cent correction to the dy process , and it is comparable to the qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "thirdly , as for the identification of the @xmath38 signal , one must consider both @xmath39 and @xmath40 , keeping in mind the interplay of the two independent parameters @xmath19 and @xmath15 that govern the two decay channels . in spite of the simple and distinctive nature of the first signal",
    ", one can not rule out their faking by a number of sources .",
    "we have studied in detail the event selection criteria which establish the _ bona fide _ of such signals in a convincing way .",
    "side by side , we are also suggesting ways of isolating the signals coming from @xmath40 , which are in general more background - prone , and can dominate the decays of the doubly charged scalar in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "most studies on the signals of doubly charged scalars have not adequately addressed the challenges posed by backgrounds in this search channel .",
    "furthermore , given the small values of @xmath41 , it is useful to investigate whether the doubly charged higgs can indeed be long - lived on the scale of collider detectors in any region of the parameter space of this scenario , a situation experimentalists have already looked for at the tevatron @xcite . and",
    "finally , we wish to point out , albeit in a qualitative way , that relative strengths of the different flavor diagonal as well as off - diagonal decays @xmath42 of the doubly charged state should give us information about the matrix @xmath19 and , in turn , generate insight into the structure of the neutrino mass matrix @xcite , which is responsible for the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern suggested by observations .",
    "we present the calculation related to both the drell - yan and two - photon production channels at the lhc in sec .",
    "section iii contains a discussion on the decay of the doubly charged states into the @xmath43 and @xmath44 final states across the parameter space allowed by the neutrino mass constraint .",
    "the signal observability at the lhc for both channels are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "as has been already discussed in the literature , the dominant chanel through which doubly charged scalar pairs can be produced at hadron colliders is the drell - yan process @xmath45 in terms of @xmath46 in the parton c.m .",
    "frame , the parton level differential cross section for this process is @xmath47 \\big\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the speed of @xmath9 in the c.m .  frame .",
    "the qcd corrections to this process have been also computed , yielding a next - to leading order ( nlo ) k - factor of the order of 1.25 at the lhc energy for the entire mass range between 200 gev and 1 tev @xcite .      due to the stronger electromagnetic coupling of the doubly charged scalar",
    ", one may anticipate a sizable two - photon contribution to the pair production . comparing with a singly charged scalar",
    ", the two - photon channel will have an enhancement factor of 16 .",
    "we consider the dominant contribution from the collinear photons and adopt the effective photon approximation .",
    "the event rates from effective photon contributions can be just added to the drell - yan contributions to the @xmath49 final state .    for the process",
    "@xmath50    the matrix element squared is @xmath51 the corresponding differential cross section can be obtained as @xmath52 it is interesting to see the different @xmath53-dependence of the cross sections for the dy and two - photon processes . the dy process undergoes a pure @xmath54-wave channel , while the two - photon process contains all @xmath55 waves leading to a general dependence of @xmath56 near the threshold .",
    "furthermore , the two - photon contributions may arise from both elastic and inelastic processes , including the semi - elastic case where it is elastic on one side and inelastic on the other .",
    "the total cross - section can thus be written as @xcite    @xmath57      the treatment in this section has ignored the channels from other gauge boson fusions such as @xmath60 ( virtual in general ) .",
    "our estimates reveal that the production through @xmath31-fusion channel is rather suppressed and more so for @xmath61-fusion .",
    "the cost of using the effective photon approximation rather than calculating the full @xmath62 subprocess is the loss of the potential tagging jets in the forward - backward regions .",
    "fortunately , due to the rather clean charged leptonic final states , we do not require such jet tagging to identify the signal .          in fig .",
    "[ rate ] the total cross - sections are plotted against the mass of the doubly charged scalar , showing the drell - yan as well as different types of the two - photon processes .",
    "the highest lower bound on a doubly charged higgs mass from the tevatron search with an integrated luminosity of 240 pb@xmath63 is about 136 gev ( though in the specific context of a left - right symmetric model ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig",
    ".  [ rate ] that with 10 fb@xmath63 at the tevatron , the mass reach may be extended approximately to 250 gev . at the lhc , the production rate is increased by a factor of 20 over that at the tevatron , reaching the order of femtobarns for a higgs mass upto as much as 600 gev , and of 0.1 fb for a mass of 1 tev .",
    "we have also shown the three classes of contributions from the two - photon channel separately .",
    "it is interesting to note that the rate of the elastic process is larger than that of the inelastic at the tevatron energies , while the pattern is reversed at the lhc energies .",
    "this is because the probability of a proton remaining unbroken after the emission of a photon in an elastic process is smaller at the lhc .",
    "the semi - elastic contribution is numerically the highest in both cases , because of a factor of 2 for the initial state interchanges .",
    "the ratio of the two - photon contribution relative to the drell - yan channel is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "in general , the two - photon contributions at lhc remain about 10% of that of the drell - yan process , while the fraction is much smaller for the tevatron , the reason being that is the photon needs to come with a larger momentum fraction of the parent parton in the latter case , for which the distribution function is relatively suppressed . it should be noted that , while the drell - yan cross - section has a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd k - factor of about 1.25 @xcite , only the leading order cross - section has been presented in these figures .",
    "this is for comparison of the correction to this cross - section due to the two - photon process and the strong correction mentioned above .",
    "higher order corrections to the two photon electromagnetic process are rather small .",
    "cteq6l parton distribution functions have been used in the calculation , and the factorization scale is set at half the subprocess center - of - mass energy @xmath64 .     and leading order @xmath65 at the lhc and the tevatron.,width=321 ]    we now examine some kinematic features of the two processes considered above .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ pt ] , while the transverse momentum ( @xmath66 ) of the scalars tends to peak at values that are significant fractions of its mass , drell - yan production leads to scalars with harder @xmath66 distributions than those from the two - photon fusion .",
    "this is due to the forward - backward nature of the @xmath67-channels in the two - photon process at high energies .",
    "the rapidity @xmath68 distributions in fig .",
    "[ eta ] reflect central peaking for both channels , and the distributions are broader for the two - photon process . on the whole , in spite of some qualitative differences between these two channels ,",
    "it is not possible effectively to separate the two production mechanisms through the kinematical considerations . in our subsequent analysis , we will add them up incoherently .",
    "the doubly charged higgs may in principle decay into all of the following two - body final states : @xmath69 the third and fourth channels depend on the mass splitting among the members of the triplet , and also the scalar potential . the consequence of the third channel being kinematically allowed ( which makes it the dominant decay , since it is driven by the su(2)@xmath0 gauge coupling ) has been discussed , for example , in reference @xcite , in the context of a linear collider . here we take a conservative approach and assume that the mass splitting within the triplet is very small as is the case , for example , in little higgs models .",
    "thus only the first two decays listed above occur in our scenario , mode will affect neither our analyses nor the results for the individual channels @xmath70 and @xmath71 , since the branching ratios in these channels have been used by us as free parameters . however , the inclusion of this mode can in principle alter the overall discovery limit , depending upon the mass parameters . ]",
    "the corresponding widths being given by @xcite    @xmath72    in terms of the kinematic function @xmath73 and the scaled mass variable @xmath74 .",
    "the approximate forms are valid for @xmath75 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the @xmath31 boson .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath31 final state becomes dominant at higher @xmath78 .",
    "the relative strengths of the two types of decays ( @xmath79 ) depend on the couplings @xmath29 as well the triplet vev @xmath15 , which has to be less than 1 gev in order to prevent large tree - level contributions to the @xmath27-parameter unless additional model assumptions are made .",
    "while treating @xmath29 and @xmath15 as completely free parameters can lead to practically any relative strength between the two sets of final states , we have been guided by the additional constraint of neutrino mass generation , to saturate the bound of eq .",
    "( [ yvev ] ) . of course",
    ", @xmath80 can be even smaller if there are right - handed neutrinos in addition , for instance , a type ii seesaw mechanism is operative .",
    "we shall further comment on this possibility at the end of this section . in fig .",
    "[ br ] we show the branching fractions for the @xmath81 and @xmath3 decay modes as functions of the triplet vev ( left ) and the higgs mass ( right ) , keeping the overall constraint from neutrino mass mentioned above . with a higher mass of @xmath9 ,",
    "the @xmath3 mode overtakes @xmath2 sooner due to the fast growing @xmath82 mode , even for a relatively smaller value of @xmath83 .",
    "while the explanation is obvious from the expressions of the decay widths , this underlines the importance of exploring the latter mode at lhc , in addition to the easily identifiable like - sign lepton pair signal .     and @xmath84 as functions of ( left ) the triplet vev , for two values of the doubly charged higgs mass , and ( right ) the higgs mass for two choices of @xmath15 .",

    ", width=321 ]    since @xmath19 and @xmath15 are both quite small , it is natural to ask whether the decay width of @xmath9 can be so small that it becomes quasi - stable in the collider experiments .",
    "as has been mentioned earlier , a long - lived doubly charged higgs has been looked for at the tevatron , in terms of highly ionizing tracks and muon - like penetration beyond the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ dl ] , we plot the the proper decay length @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the proper lifetime of @xmath9 , keeping within the constraint on @xmath88 from neutrino mass to saturate eq .",
    "( [ yvev ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that , for a light scalar @xmath89 gev with certain values of @xmath15 , the proper decay length may exceed 10 microns .",
    "such a decay length can be enhanced to a visible displaced secondary vertex by the appropriate boost @xmath90 .",
    "the length goes further down for a more massive scalar .",
    "thus it can be concluded that a doubly charged higgs can not be long - lived , or quasi - stable , on the scale of a collider detector if its @xmath10 coupling has to be the mechanism operative for the generation of neutrino masses .",
    "the observation of a long - lived @xmath9 should therefore tell us that something over and above the @xmath10 interaction is active for generating neutrino masses .",

    "as mentioned earlier , we have assumed the same branching ratio for flavor diagonal decays into the three lepton channels , and included the electron and muon pairs as our characteristic signals .",
    "the branching ratio into lepton pairs has been taken as a free parameter , since , given the neutrino mass constraint , the decay rate into @xmath94 is automatically determined by it .",

    "such a scalar is assumed to belong to an su(2)@xmath0 triplet which can generate majorana masses for left - handed neutrinos through the vev of its neutral component .",
    "pair - production , in spite of its relative kinematical suppression , has the advantage of being relatively model - independent , and is not driven by the vev of the triplet .",
    "we find that , while the contribution comes largely from the drell - yan process , two - photon fusion also contributes at the level of 10% at the lhc due to the substantially enhanced electromagnetic coupling .",
    "this , we emphasize , is comparable to the qcd correction to the drell - yan channel , and must be included in a complete and accurate estimate .",
    "signatures of the pair - produced scalars have been investigated over the entire parameter space where viable neutrino masses can arise from the scalar triplet .",
    "we have covered both the regions where they decay dominantly into like - sign dileptons and like - sign @xmath31 s .",
    "the former are largely free from backgrounds , and a mass range upto about @xmath141 to @xmath142 can be probed with an integrated luminosity of 300 @xmath143 , if the doubly charged higgs has a branching ratio of at least @xmath144 in this channel . in the latter channel , we have suggested optimal ways of eliminating the standard model backgrounds with high efficiency for the signal retention .",
    "the signal observation is mainly a statistical issue , and a doubly charged scalar of mass up to about 700 gev should be identifiable , if it dominantly decays into a pair of like - sign @xmath31 s . with the spirit of neutrino mass generation of eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the signal complementarity between the @xmath145 and @xmath146 channels as shown in fig .",
    "[ ww](b ) by the 3-event contours , we claim a complete coverage for @xmath147 gev with any arbitrary decay of these two modes .",
    "there has been great interest of searches for long - lived doubly charged scalars .",
    "we found that in order to have the requisite contribution to neutrino masses , it is not possible for the scalar to be long - lived , although it is possible to leave a perceptible decay gap at the detector for @xmath148 gev .",
    "any observation of long - lived scalars of this kind will therefore be a pointer towards some alternative theory of neutrino masses such as the type ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that a study of the decays of the doubly charged scalar into different lepton flavors , diagonal as well as off - diagonal , is a very useful probe of the mechanism whereby neutrino masses arise from interaction with an su(2)@xmath0 scalar triplet .",
    "this probe is eminently within the scope of the lhc .",
