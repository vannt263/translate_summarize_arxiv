    "two parallel developments have changed our possibilities of understanding and predicting the energetics and dynamics of condensed - matter systems over the past few years .",
    "one is the development of _ ab initio _ total - energy methods@xcite based on density - functional theory@xcite , and the local - density approximation@xcite .",
    "it is now possible to calculate total energies and equilibrium configurations of systems with up to a few hundreds of atoms@xcite , and in other cases it has been possible to study the molecular dynamics directly@xcite . during this time , there has been a parallel development of approximate and semi - empirical total - energy methods@xcite which has made it possible to treat the dynamics and thermal properties of systems with many thousand atoms with a reasonable accuracy@xcite . with such methods",
    "it is now possible to treat problems in materials physics where extended defects or long range disorder are crucial for the properties that are under study .",
    "the hope is to develop methods with the accuracy and robustness of the _ ab initio _ methods which can handle the larger systems on a reasonable time scale .",
    "one problem with the _ ab initio _ methods is the fact that the computer time scales as the cube of the number of atoms . new developments of methods where the computer time scales linearly with the size of the system have all focussed on localized basis sets@xcite .",
    "one important problem here is to construct the hamiltonian .",
    "a natural choice would be to use the lmto method in the tight - binding formulation@xcite , but at the present time these methods usually rely on semi - empirical tight - binding models constructed to fit a set of properties .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce a very efficient and accurate method for calculating total energies for si based on density - functional theory .",
    "the method is approximate , but computationally very efficient ( 2 orders of magnitude faster than conventional _ ab initio _ methods ) . a set of well defined approximations are made in the total energy expression where we rely on the variational nature of the generalized total energy functional to compute energies reliably .",
    "since the approximations are very systematic , we are able to test the validity of the assumptions at each stage , and therefore in a controlled way develop a hierarchy of models with various levels of approximations .",
    "all input terms are calculated theoretically , i.e. no fitting to experiment .",
    "we have earlier demonstrated the versatility of the first levels of approximations in its application to metallic al@xcite .",
    "the method utilizes the effective - medium theory concept of an effective medium or reference system . instead of calculating the total energy of a system of interacting si atoms directly , we associate with each atom in the system a reference system where the energy of the atom can be calculated easily and where the surroundings of the atom in question are sufficiently similar to those of the system of interest that the energy difference can be calculated approximately .",
    "our main approximations are to use a transferable input charge density@xcite and a transferable effective potential@xcite . from these approximations",
    "the energy difference can be calculated with a density - dependent pair potential and an lmto tight - binding hamiltonian , with all the in - going parameters determined from the transferable charge density and effective potential .",
    "we have made extensive comparisons of the results of this new method with selfconsistent calculations of elastic properties , phonons , surfaces , different crystallographic phases , surface reconstructions and adatoms on surfaces . in all cases",
    "the quality of the results is good , and we show that in the cases where the empirical tight - binding method is known to fail , the new method works well .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the scheme to calculate total energies for si systems , which is summarized in the first part of section iv .",
    "the basis of the method is the harris functional and the effective - medium theory concept of a reference system .",
    "these aspects of the paper are discussed in section ii and the first part of section iii . in the second part of section iii",
    "we construct the lmto tight - binding model from which the one - electron energy is calculated .",
    "the tests of the new method are given in section iv , which also includes a discussion of the relation of the present method to the empirical tight - binding method .",
    "the so - called harris functional @xcite is a good starting point for investigating the theoretical foundations of the tight - binding method@xcite due to the non - selfconsistent nature of the functional and the fact that it only depends on the input charge density .",
    "if the input density is good enough @xcite , then this will give a considerable savings in computer time since only a single iteration of the kohn - sham equations is needed . in this work ,",
    "we invoke these properties of the harris functional to develop a model potential for si .",
    "we have discussed previously @xcite the systematic decomposition of a selfconsistent total charge density into atomic - like optimized densities @xmath0 here , we use norm - conserving nonlocal pseudopotentials @xcite within a plane - wave basis @xcite at an energy cutoff of 12 ry to compute the selfconsistent charge densities of bulk si and the ideal ( 111 ) surface from which we extract the reciprocal - space components of the optimized density @xmath1 ( see appendix i ) . reverting to real - space , the optimized density shown in fig .",
    "1 has the well known features of a contraction in the outer core region and a sharper attenuation of the tail with some barely discernible friedel oscillations @xcite . as noted before @xcite ,",
    "embedding an atom in a homogeneous electron gas at typical metallic densities produces very similar features , and this is of interest here because renormalizing the atom in this manner is the basis of the effective - medium theory of jacobsen , puska and nrskov @xcite .",
    "we have extracted reciprocal - space components of the optimized density for the other two principal surface orientations , viz .",
    "( 100 ) and ( 110 ) , and we find that to a good approximation , the components fall on the same universal curve .",
    "we will now make the assumption that @xmath2 is indeed universal and transferable , and in the next subsection we will test this ansatz by computing the harris functional for various different test situations and comparing with the selfconsistent results .      in order to test the accuracy of the approximations at each step in the potential construction , we will use a data base of test systems .",
    "this data base covers silicon in different crystallographic structures at the equilibrium volume , phonons , elastic constants , and surfaces . for the surfaces , we have used a supercell geometry with 12 atoms , and for all calculations we ensure an adequate sampling @xcite of the brillouin zone .    in table  1",
    ", we compare the harris with the selfconsistent results .",
    "we also include the effective - medium tight - binding ( emtb ) results and those of the empirical tight - binding model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "we note that using the harris functional with our choice of input - charge density , constructed from spherically - symmetric atomic - like densities ( i.e. without bond - charges ) , there is excellent corroboration with the selfconsistent results .",
    "other studies@xcite using the free atom density as an input into the harris functional have reproduced the bulk selfconsistent results with a similar degree of accuracy .",
    "our first new result is that the total energies of the ideal surfaces of this semiconducting material are accurately derived from a non - selfconsistent calculation .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is so despite the fact that the exact position of the surface states are known to be sensitive to the degree of selfconsistency .",
    "the reason is simply that the total energy is stationary in the density while the position of the surface states are not .",
    "we therefore emphasize that the derived potential should only be used for predicting physical quantities which are stationary in the density .",
    "we will use the effective - medium construction as a basis for making further approximations .",
    "the effective - medium idea is to first calculate the total energy for a series of reference systems , and then for a given system relate each atom to a reference system , and only calculate the energy difference between the two systems .",
    "if the reference system is chosen wisely , the energy difference will be small , and can therefore be calculated approximately . to find the appropriate reference system",
    ", we will introduce the concept of a neutral sphere , defined to be a sphere around an atom for which the electron density exactly compensates the positive atomic charge . as reference system we will use silicon in the diamond structure with a lattice constant such that the neutral - sphere radius is the same in the reference system as for the atom in the original system .    in calculating this energy difference",
    "we will utilize that the hohenberg - kohn density functional can be generalized to a functional @xmath3 $ ] which depends on both the density @xmath4 and the potential @xmath5@xcite and which is stationary with respect to independent variations of each variable .",
    "the general functional can be written as @xmath6= \\sum_{\\alpha } \\epsilon_\\alpha[v ] - \\int n({\\bf r } ) v({\\bf r } )   d{\\bf r } + e_{el}[n ] + e_{xc}[n],\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] denotes the eigenvalues generated by solving the kohn - sham equation with the potential @xmath5 , and where @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] is the electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy , respectively .",
    "if the potential is restricted to be a functional of the density the hohenberg - kohn functional or the harris functional appear as special cases@xcite .",
    "we have already used the stationary property of the density by calculating the total energy using a superposition of atom - based optimized densities .",
    "we will show that from this approximation the electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy can be transformed into a density - dependent pair - potential sum by linearizing the exchange - correlation functional .    in order to get a simple scheme for calculating the kinetic energy we will use the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) .",
    "we thereby exploit the stationary property of the the kinetic energy functional with respect to variations in the potential by substituting the full potential with the spherically - averaged potential within each neutral sphere .",
    "furthermore , we have recently shown@xcite that the spherically - averaged potential of the reference system is very similar to that of the real system , and since the kinetic energy functional is stationary in the potential it is a good approximation to substitute the spherically - averaged potential within each sphere with the potential of the reference system .",
    "this last approximation transforms the potential - energy contribution to the kinetic - energy difference into a sum of density - dependent pair potentials .",
    "the remaining term is the one - electron energy which we calculate using an lmto tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "since the only potential appearing in the problem is now that of the reference system , we can precalculate the potential parameters and , by constructing an interpolation formula for the structure constants , we obtain a simple density - dependent two - center tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "we have now given a brief description of the main approximations used in the construction of the effective - medium tight - binding ( emtb ) model . in the following ,",
    "we give a more detailed account of the construction .      in the original effective - medium theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , each atom is viewed as embedded in the electron density from the neighboring atoms and , when averaged , this density provides an effective medium in the form of a homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the role of the homogeneous electron gas is to provide a reference system in which the atoms have similar chemical surroundings as in the original system . in order to obtain the total energy",
    ", corrections due to the non smoothness of the charge density have to be included ; however these corrections are small and can be calculated approximately .",
    "we will use the effective - medium construction and calculate the total energy @xmath10 as @xmath11 , \\label{eq : emt}\\ ] ] where we use the neutral - sphere radius @xmath12 of each atom to define the reference system and @xmath13 is the energy of the reference system with neutral - sphere radius @xmath14 . note that since the electron density is constructed using eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt ] ) , the choice of identical neutral spheres in the two systems is equivalent to the choice of identical embedding density used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for silicon in the pseudo - potential scheme",
    "the neutral sphere contains 4 electrons , and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt ] ) we obtain the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron - density contribution from atom @xmath17 to a sphere at site @xmath18 of radius @xmath12 , @xmath19 we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : neuts ] ) iteratively for the neutral - sphere radius , using a cutoff distance of @xmath20 to terminate the sum ( we thereby include five neighbor shells in the equilibrium diamond lattice ) . for this lattice , the nearest - neighbor distance is @xmath21 and we obtain a neutral - sphere radius of @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsss ] we show the neutral - sphere radius of the diamond structure as a function of the nearest - neighbor distance . for comparison",
    ", we also show the wigner - seitz radius of the diamond lattice and the @xmath23 smaller wigner - seitz radius of a diamond lattice embedded in a bcc lattice with empty spheres .",
    "we see that in the diamond structure the neutral - sphere radius is substantially smaller than the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "this difference is due to the large regions in the diamond lattice which contain almost no charge and therefore are not included in the neutral sphere . in a more close packed system like the fcc system",
    "the neutral - sphere radius is more or less equal to the wigner - seitz ( ws ) radius .    as reference system",
    "we will use the diamond structure , and the energy correction therefore vanishes for a diamond lattice or an isolated atom , since the latter can be regarded as a diamond lattice with an infinite lattice constant .",
    "so by construction the emtb will give the correct cohesive energy , bulk modulus , and equilibrium lattice constant for the diamond structure .    in order to calculate the energy difference to the reference system",
    ", we divide the total energy into two terms ; the kinetic energy ( @xmath24 ) and the sum of the electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 + [ g-\\sum_i g^{ref}(s_i ) ] , \\\\",
    "e & = & \\sum_i e^{ref}(s ) + \\delta t + \\delta g. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so far we have just rearranged the terms in the total energy .",
    "the first approximation we make is to calculate the kinetic energy in the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) .",
    "the quality of this approximation depends on how well the full potential can be approximated by a superposition of spherically - averaged potentials within atomic spheres .",
    "traditionally , the asa is made using space - filling spheres on the ground that with this choice integrals over space may be mapped into integrals over the spheres  the integration of a constant function will therefore be correct in the asa . however , since the density enters all integrals , we will use neutral spheres , making the spheres charge conserving instead of volume conserving  the integration of a constant function times the density is correct .",
    "this choice seems more physical since we thereby obtain that both the asa density and the full density contains the correct number of electrons , which is not fulfilled when the asa is used with volume conserving spheres . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sipot ] we show the full selfconsistent potential of silicon in a ( 110 ) diamond plane , together with the neutral - sphere radius ( solid circle ) and wigner - seitz radius ( dotted circle ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the overlap region of the ws spheres penetrates far into the spherically symmetric parts of the potential , which would lead to a poor approximation of the full potential .",
    "the overlap region of the neutral - spheres , on the other hand , very accurately sample only the asymmetric part of the potential and since the potentials are superimposed the approximation is enhanced in this region .",
    "we will use the asa with neutral spheres , and because we thereby obtain an accurate approximation for the full potential we may avoid the traditional usage of empty spheres in asa calculations for open structures .",
    "we have recently shown that with our choice of reference system the asa potential of a general system is almost identical to the potential of the reference system@xcite , so that we may at each site substitute the potential within the atomic sphere with the reference potential .",
    "furthermore , due to the variational properties of the energy functional , this only leads to errors in the total energy of second order in the potential difference @xmath27 .",
    "we then have for the kinetic - energy difference @xmath28 - \\sum_i e_{1el}(s_i )   - \\sum_i \\int_{s_i } \\bar{v}^{ref}(r , s_i ) ( n({\\bf r})-n^{ref}({\\bf r } ) ) d{\\bf r } , \\\\ &",

    "let us now summarize the total binding - energy expression in the form used in the effective - medium theory of ref .",
    "the total binding energy is given by @xmath31 + \\delta e_{1el } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are called the cohesive function , atomic - sphere correction , and one - electron correction , respectively .    the first term , the cohesive function , is the energy of the reference system , which we parametrize using the interpolation formula@xcite @xmath34 in this equation , @xmath35 , is the cohesive energy of the equilibrium diamond lattice and the parameter , @xmath36 , is determined by the bulk - modulus of the diamond lattice .",
    "the second term , the atomic - sphere correction , can be viewed as a correction to an asa calculation of the electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy .",
    "to see this we use the definition of the effective potential @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the asa electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy of the reference system .",
    "we can now identify the @xmath39 term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tapp ] ) as the first term in a taylor expansion of the difference in the asa electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy between the system and the reference systems ( @xmath40 ) , and we therefore have @xmath41 ^ 2)$ ] .",
    "we see that the atomic - sphere correction is the first order correction to a calculation where not only the kinetic energy , but also the exchange and correlation energy have been calculated within the asa , i.e. the asa has been used for both the potential and the density . in the next section",
    "we will show that the atomic - sphere correction can be calculated by a density - dependent pair potential .",
    "the third term , the one - electron correction , is the energy correction due to the difference in band structure between the system and the reference system , and in section  [ sec : e1el ] we will calculate this term using an lmto tight - binding model .    in table  2",
    "we show the emtb terms for the test systems of table  1 .",
    "the cohesive energy and atomic - sphere correction were extracted from a harris functional calculation and the one - electron correction then obtained by subtracting these terms from the total energy . with this data base we may not only check the potential by calculating the total energy , but we may test the accuracy of each term in the energy separately .",
    "for now we will just note that the contribution from the cohesive function to the energy of the equilibrium structures is very small , indicating that it is the minimum of this function that determines the equilibrium volumes .",
    "since the cohesive function depends only on the neutral - sphere radius , this implies that all the equilibrium structures have almost the same neutral - sphere radius , even though the equilibrium volumes are very different .",
    "we will now decompose the atomic - sphere correction into density - dependent pairwise interactions .",
    "the interactions depend on the local density through the neutral - sphere radius s @xmath42 where the pair potential is composed of three parts @xmath43 which originates from the @xmath44 term , the electrostatic energy , and the exchange - correlation energy , respectively . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt ] ) and eq .",

    "@xcite , and from the decomposition of the density we have @xmath47 in order to approximate this term with a pair - potential sum we will have to divide the exchange - correlation functional into contributions from each atom , which may be obtained by using a linear expansion for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we have chosen to linearize the exchange - correlation functional around the spherically - averaged density of the reference system , @xmath48 , and thereby obtain the pair potential @xmath49 in table  [ tab : efitxc ] we compare the exchange - correlation part of the atomic - sphere correction calculated using this pair potential to an exact evaluation of the exchange - correlation integral .",
    "we see that the correction generally is underestimated by 20 percent .",
    "this suggests that a better approximation might be obtained if the exchange - correlation functional is linearized at a lower density than the mean density , possibly because it varies more rapidly in the low density regime .",
    "we have not addressed this problem further , being satisfied with the fact that when a factor is allowed for rescaling the pair potential we obtain a good description of the exchange - correlation energy , as shown in the third column of table  [ tab : efitxc ] .",
    "we conclude this section by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig : vd ] the distance dependence of the pair potentials , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : vs ] the dependence upon the neutral - sphere radius .",
    "we see that the distance dependence of the sum is nearly exponential even though the distance dependence of the individual components is not .",
    "the dependence upon the neutral - sphere radius is dominated by the contribution from the exchange - correlation part , which approximately scales as @xmath50 , originating from the scaling of the mean density in the reference system .",
    "returning to the expression for the total energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : etot ] ) , we have already given expressions for the first two terms and need only to calculate the one - electron correction to obtain the total energy .",
    "this is the most time consuming step in a total - energy calculation since it involves the diagonalization of a hamiltonian .",
    "the key number in this context is the number of basis functions ( @xmath51 ) because the computer time used in conventional diagonalization schemes scales as o(@xmath52 ) ) where m is the system size .",
    "however , the prefactor is large such that this method generally is two orders of magnitude slower than tight - binding methods . ] .",
    "a plane - wave basis set is in this respect not very efficient , since many plane - waves are needed in order to get a good description of the regions around the atomic positions where the electron density varies rapidly .",
    "instead , we will use a partial wave method in which the basis functions are augmented with the the local solution of the schrdinger equation around each atom , and therefore only a small basis set is needed .",
    "however , the partial waves depend on the energy at which the schrdinger equation is solved , and the hamiltonian thereby becomes energy dependent .",
    "this problem is solved very elegantly in the linearized band - structure methods where an energy independent basis set is obtained by linearizing the solutions of the schrdinger equation around a fixed energy @xmath53 .",
    "we will use the linearized muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) method@xcite , and with these basis functions , called lmto s , the eigenvalues become correct to first order in the difference with the energy @xmath53 , and a systematic expansion exists for the higher order corrections .",
    "for now we will only consider the first order approximation , and we may then neglect the overlap of the orbitals , since the overlap enters as a higher order correction .",
    "since we use the asa for calculating the kinetic energy the first order lmto hamiltonian becomes especially simple .",

    "[ eq : bonde ] vanishes , and this greatly simplifies the calculation of forces . due to this approximation the total energy for the surfaces will be a little to high with the emtb model .    in table",
    "[ tab : efite1el ] we show the one - electron correction obtained with this scheme compared to the value of the plane - wave harris functional calculation . we see that the correction generally is overestimated by 2 percent .",
    "we can improve the values slightly by scaling all potential parameters with this factor , see table  [ tab : potdat ] , and we then obtain the one - electron correction in the last column of table  [ tab : efite1el ] .",
    "we see that for all test systems the accuracy is acceptable when compared with the value of the total energy of table  [ tab : ediv ] . in the next section",
    "we will first sum up the ingredients of the emtb , and then compare it to empirical tight - binding schemes by applying both models to various test systems .",

    "we have calculated the total energy for the test systems of table  [ tab : etot ] and the corresponding results are shown in the third column .      in a conventional empirical tight - binding scheme",
    "the energy function consists of an attractive band structure term describing the bonding in the system and a repulsive pair potential usually interpreted as arising from the overlap interaction . for the comparison we will use the tight - binding model of goodwin et .",
    "al@xcite , with a fixed cutoff as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the following we will denote this model emptb . the emptb is based on the nearest - neighbor tight - binding model of harrison@xcite , in which the strength of the hopping integrals is obtained by fitting the bandstructure , and the level splitting is taken to be identical to that of the atom .",
    "harrison assumed an universal decay of the pair potential and hopping integrals , such that the only parameter remaining to be determined is the strength of the pair potential , which was fixed to give the correct equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "the resulting model gives an excellent description of the elastic properties of silicon in the diamond structure , however the model fails to predict the energies of different silicon phases .",
    "goodwin et .",
    "al made the model transferable to other structures by introducing a scaling of the hopping integrals , and adjusting the level splitting .",
    "their model has four adjustable parameters which were fixed to give the cohesive energy and bulk modulus of the diamond and fcc structure .",
    "this scheme has proven very successful for describing systems@xcite far from the structures where the tight - binding parameters were fitted , and currently most empirical tight - binding schemes use a similar functional form .",
    "the last column in table  [ tab : etot ] shows the total energies of the test systems obtained with the emptb .",
    "we see that the elastic properties are described very well by the emptb , while the total energies of the structures and surfaces are not too accurate .",

    "[ fig : bandstruct ] we show the bandstructure of the two models compared to a selfconsistent calculation . for the emtb model",
    "the description of the occupied bands is excellent . in the emptb model",
    "the description is reasonable , with largest error for the lowest state at the @xmath16 point .",
    "also the bandgap at the @xmath16 point is too small in the emptb model , this is of importance when the model is used together with the o(n ) method of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a large bandgap is needed in order to make the scheme efficient .",
    "the difference between the two tight - binding models become apparent when we look at the distance dependence of the matrix elements . in the emtb",
    "the distance dependence is divided into two parts , scaling of the potential parameters and the structure matrix .",
    "when we have a uniform compression , without a structural change , only the potential parameters change .",
    "these scale approximately as @xmath108 , which is similar to the scaling of ref .",
    "when there is a structural change the scaling should be stronger , and this scaling enters through the structure constants . in the emptb these two basic scalings are mixed into one function .    in the last column of table  [ tab : efite1el ] we show the value of the one - electron correction as obtained when the emptb is used to describe the one - electron energy for the system and reference system .",
    "clearly the emptb does not describe the one - electron correction , with largest discrepancies for surfaces and structural energies . for these systems",
    "we have found crystal field terms to be important , i.e. off diagonal on - site elements and shifts of the level spacings .",
    "such effects are not included in the emptb , but enter in the emtb through eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "besides the one - electron term there is a pair - potential term in both models .",
    "however the emtb pair potential is negative , while the emptb pair potential is positive .",
    "the emptb pair potential can therefore not only describe the electrostatic and exchange - correlation energy , but must include some terms from the kinetic energy . in the work of harrison@xcite",
    "the pair potential is viewed as an overlap interaction , i.e. it is mainly due to the one - electron energy .    in the emtb",
    "there is an additional term , the cohesive function .",
    "the fact that this term is not equal to the sum of the reference pair - potential and one - electron energies , illustrates the idea behind the reference system : because the reference system is chosen for a given atom so that the environment of the atom is similar to the environment in the real system it is possible to calculate the energy difference with a rather crude tight - binding model .",
    "the largest error is in the shift of the average on - site term of the hamiltonian , but since the potentials are identical in the system and reference system this error for the system is canceled by a similar error in the one - electron energy of the reference system , and the correct binding energy is then obtained through the cohesive function .    in the next section",
    "we will calculate the phase diagram for silicon and in section  [ sec:100 ] ,  [ sec:111 ] we will investigate some of the reconstructions of the ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] we show the total energies versus volume for the diamond , clathrate ii@xcite , @xmath109-tin , simple cubic , bcc and fcc phases of silicon calculated with the emtb and emptb schemes .",
    "the emtb potential gives a good description of the cohesive energy and the equilibrium volume for all the phases investigated , while the emptb predicts the correct energy ordering of all the phases , excluding the clathrate  ii structure which is lower than the diamond structure , but the equilibrium volumes are shifted .",
    "the small cutoff of the interactions in the emptb model becomes visible for the @xmath109-tin and fcc phase , i.e. second nearest neighbors enter within the cutoff range . in the emtb scheme we also use a fixed cutoff , however in this case we use a relative distance measure which is scale - invariant , and this ensures that for a given structure we include the same number of neighbors independent of the lattice constant . for the emtb model",
    "we have found crystal field effects to give an important contribution to the structural energies .",
    "for instance in the fcc phase @xmath110 compared to @xmath111 in the diamond phase .",
    "there has been a large effort to understand the different reconstructions of the ( 100 ) surface , involving a wide range of experimental and theoretical tools since different reconstructions occur at different length scales . however , the reconstructions are so complex that there are still a lot of unsolved problems , especially for systems involving too few atoms in order for elasticity theory to be correct , and too many atoms to be feasible for plane - wave methods .",
    "there is a general consensus that the main building block for all the reconstructions is the buckled 1x2 dimer reconstruction .",
    "this structure was first predicted by chadi@xcite from a tight - binding calculation , and lately also selfconsistent plane - wave calculations@xcite have found this structure to be lower in energy than a symmetric dimer reconstruction .",
    "so for a potential to give a detailed description of the various reconstructions on the ( 100 ) surface , it should at least predict the correct 1x2 dimer reconstruction .    in table",
    "[ tab : surfcalc ] we show the result of a relaxation of the ( 100 ) 1x1 and 2x1 reconstructions using the emtb and emptb compared to the results of selfconsistent plane - wave calculations . for both models",
    "the description of the structure of the 1x2 reconstruction is good , but the emtb gives a too high relaxation energy , while the the relaxation energy of the emptb is far too small . for the emtb",
    "the driving force for the reconstruction is the atomic - sphere correction , and not the one - electron correction .",
    "the atomic - sphere correction always drives the system to more close packed structures , and in this case that can be done without an increase in the one - electron energy .",
    "both models predict an outward relaxation of the 1x1 cell , while the selfconsistent calculation predicts an inward relaxation .",
    "also the ( 111 ) surface has many interesting reconstructions , the most famous being the 7x7 tagayanagi reconstruction@xcite .",
    "this reconstruction is built from adatom geometries where the adatoms sit on top sites , and studies using selfconsistent plane - wave calculations have confirmed the stability of adatoms in top site positions@xcite . for a potential to predict the correct reconstructions of the ( 111 ) surface it therefore has to describe these adatom geometries properly .    in table",
    "[ tab : surfcalc ] we show the result of a relaxation of the ( 111 ) 1x1 surface , and of the top and hollow site adatom geometries in a @xmath112 cell .",
    "the selfconsistent numbers are from two different references ; the top site geometry were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with a ten layer slab and a 12 ry cutoff . in the other reference@xcite the energy of the adatom in both the top and hollow positions where calculated but with an eight layer slab using a 6 ry cutoff .",
    "we see that both tight - binding models predict the top site to be more stable than the hollow site geometry , however the formation energies obtained with the emptb are far too small , while the emtb is in excellent agreement with the data of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the formation energy obtained with the empirical tight - binding scheme is too low to stabilize the adatom , and therefore additional parameters have to be introduced in order to describe the 7x7 reconstruction@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t4 ] we show the geometry of the adatom in the top position , and in table  [ tab : surfcalc ] we compare the relaxed coordinates .",
    "in the present paper we have presented a new method for total energy calculations for si systems .",
    "we have discussed in detail the hierarchy of approximations behind the present formulation .",
    "starting from a fully selfconsistent solution of the kohn - sham equations the first level of approximation is to use the harris functional with transferable , optimized densities centered at each atomic position deduced from independent selfconsistent calculations for different bulk and surface structures . at this level the errors introduced compared to the fully selfconsistent calculations are very small .",
    "the next level of approximation involves the introduction of a reference system .",
    "we have shown that choosing a reference system with the same neutral - sphere radius ( or average electron density ) as in the real system gives one - electron potentials and potential parameters for the lmto hamiltonian that can be transferred from the reference system to the real system with very little error .",
    "the energy difference between the reference system and the real system can be calculated from a difference between a density - dependent pair - potential sum in the real and the reference system and a one - electron energy difference .",
    "the former describes to a very good approximation the difference in the electrostatic , exchange correlation and part of the kinetic energy .",
    "the one - electron energy difference taking care of the rest of the energy difference is evaluated using an lmto tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the results of the new method are very encouraging .",
    "the computational effort is similar to empirical tight - binding methods but the results seem to be better .",
    "the time consuming part of the calculation is the diagonalization of the lmto hamiltonian and for this part the newly proposed `` order n '' methods can be used@xcite , since the bandgap at the @xmath16 point is well described .",
