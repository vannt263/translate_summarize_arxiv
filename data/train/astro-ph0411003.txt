    "since the discovery of bright x - ray novae ( xrne ) , these bright , transient x - ray events have allowed some of the most detailed studies of the properties of the accretion disks of stellar - mass compact objects ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) . while xrne have been observed in both high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ; @xcite ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , most of those occurring in lmxbs",
    "are confirmed black hole binaries . in 15 galactic xrne systems",

    "therefore , these objects are among the firmest examples of black hole candidates known @xcite , and are of intense interest as sites to study general relativity in the ` strong gravity ' regime .",
    "the discovery of extragalactic xrne is therefore a crucial step forward in the study of extragalactic stellar - mass black holes .    with x - ray luminosities ranging from 10@xmath1410@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 @xcite",

    "most recently , by combining the power of _ chandra _ with _ hst _ , x - ray / optical studies of the xrne in m31 have begun , providing new details and comparisons to their galactic siblings ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "along with three x - ray detections of this source , we have obtained contemporaneous _ hst _ acs images of the region where the xrn appeared .",
    "the x - ray data provide measurements of the xrn luminosity and the decay pattern .",
    "the optical data provide constraints on the physical properties of the progenitor binary system .",
    "we obtained _ chandra _ acis - i images of m31 on 09-nov-2003 , 26-nov-2003 , and 27-dec-2003 .",
    "in addition to the 4 acis - i chips , the s2 and s3 chips were on during the observations . the observations were performed in `` alternating exposure readout '' , so that every 6th frame had 0.6 seconds of exposure instead of the canonical 3.2 seconds .",

    "these 3 observations were all reduced in an identical manner using the x - ray data analysis package ciao v3.0.2 .",

    "errors for the x - ray positions were determined using the iraf task _ imcentroid _ , which determines the errors of the point spread function ( psf ) along each pixel axis independently .",
    "the counts from the source are projected onto each axis , and the error in the position is then calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the pixel positions of all of the source counts by the square root of the number of counts .",
    "as the pixels in _ chandra _ images are aligned with north up and east to the left , the x position error was taken to be the r.a .",

    "our first detection of the source , with an unabsorbed 0.37 kev luminosity of 2.4@xmath1810@xmath29 erg s@xmath10 , shows that it brightened by a factor of @xmath30100 .",
    "the next two observations in our m31 monitoring program ( obsids 4679 and 4680 ) confirmed the transient nature of the source , as the x - ray flux decayed by a factor of 7.3 in 48 days .",

    "we considered the arrival times for the 758 counts contained in the region of s1 - 86 as measured by _",
    "wavdetect_. this test returned a p - value of 0.969 , which provides no indication of variability during the observation .",
    "next , the three positional measurements for s1 - 86 and their errors ( given in table  [ xpos ] ) were combined to determine the most accurate coordinates for the x - ray source .",
    "table  [ xpos ] includes the 3 largest sources of positional errors in our analysis .",
    "these errors were all included in our determination of the x - ray position of s1 - 86 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 corresponds to the positional error measured by _ imcentroid _ , which is limited by the large psf at the location of s1 - 86 , 16@xmath26 off - axis .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 corresponds to the positional error of the alignment of the acis x - ray positions with the lgs coordinate system , measured by _",
    "the quantity @xmath35 corresponds to the positional error of sources on the acis - s chips when acis - i is the aimpoint , as was the case for all 3 of our detections of s1 - 86 ; this error was estimated by markevitch .",

    "we included this error by adding it directly to our totals from the other errors .",
    "the weighted mean of the three positions and combined random errors ( excluding @xmath35 ) provided our best measurement of the location of s1 - 86 : r.a.=00:44:06.68 @xmath00.74@xmath1 , dec.=41:12:20.0 @xmath01.31@xmath1 . after adding the systematic ( @xmath36 ) error to both coordinates , the final ( 1@xmath28 ) r.a .",

    "the disk blackbody fits suggest that , during the decay of the x - ray flux , there was a decrease in the inner disk temperature from 0.6 kev to 0.4 kev .",

    "if this fading optical source is indeed the counterpart of s1 - 86 , we can use the simultaneous x - ray and optical luminosities to predict the orbital period for the system using the relation of @xcite . since this relation was seen in galactic xrne events ,",
    "there have been many new systems discovered .",
    "using the lmxb catalog of @xcite , we checked the consistency of this relation with more recent x - ray novae , including gro  j1655 - 40 , 4u  1543 - 47 , xte  1550 - 564 , xte  j1118 + 480 , and v4641  sgr . with the exception of xte  j1118 + 480 , which was two magnitudes brighter in the optical than the prediction from the relation ,",
    "these more recent xrne all fit the @xcite relation .",
    "the higher than expected optical luminosity of xte  j1118 + 480 can be understood in the context of the van paradijs and mcclintock model , which postulates that the optical flux is due solely to x - ray heating .",
    "xte  j1118 + 480 has the lowest x - ray luminosity of all sources in the sample , and is therefore the most likely to reveal optical emission above and beyond that due to x - ray heating .",
    "the @xcite relation requires only simultaneous measurements of the absolute @xmath49 magnitude and the x - ray luminosity to predict the orbital period of an lmxb system .",
    "these measurements can be taken from any part of an outburst when the dominant contributor to the optical flux is x - ray heating ; the peak luminosity and outburst amplitude are not required in the application of the relation .",

    "we apply the x - ray luminosity on 03-dec-2003 as predicted by our linear decay fit to the lightcurve ( 1.4@xmath1810@xmath29 erg s@xmath10 ) . to determine @xmath53",
    ", we apply the @xmath25 magnitude of our candidate ( 25.75@xmath00.05 ) , and correct for the absorption measured in the x - ray spectra ( ( 2.2@xmath00.3 ) @xmath1810@xmath27 @xmath9 ) .",
    "this absorption can be converted to @xmath54 using the conversion of @xcite and assuming a standard interstellar extinction law .",

    ", the inferred disk size is then @xmath580.7@xmath59  cm .",
    "these values are reasonable , but pushing the low end , for a large disk that would produce a long , linear x - ray decay like the one observed for s1 - 86 @xcite .",
    "if we simply apply the x - ray luminosity and absorption given by the power - law fit from the x - ray detection closest in time to the first optical detection ( 26-november-2003 ; 1.8@xmath1810@xmath29 erg s@xmath10 ; see table  [ spec.dat ] ) , rather than interpolating the x - ray luminosity on december 3 as we have done above , the calculated period is not significantly affected ( 0.9@xmath60 day ) . however ,",
    "if we apply the x - ray luminosity and absorption column values given by the disk blackbody fits in table  [ spec.dat2 ] , the calculated period is 0.3@xmath61 day . applying kepler s law , the inferred disk size is then @xmath583@xmath62  cm .",

    "such values are below those predicted for xrne with long , linear x - ray decays ( @xcite ; see   4.1.2 ) .",
    "@xcite determined that the mean optical decay timescale for galactic xrne is a factor of 2.2 longer than the x - ray decay timescale .",
    "this mean difference in decay timescales is in agreement with theoretical models of accretion processes , which predict that the optical decay timescales will be longer than x - ray decay times by a factor of 24 @xcite .    for s1 - 86 ,",
    "the _ total _ x - ray decay time was @xmath1760 days .",
    "since the optical flux of the second detection ( 01-mar-2004 ) of the counterpart candidate was 30% of the 03-dec-2003 optical flux 88 days earlier , we estimate the optical decay time for the candidate to be @xmath17130 days .",
    "our estimate of the optical / x - ray decay time ratio is therefore @xmath172.2 .",
    "the decay time ratios for the galactic xrne in the @xcite sample cover a wide range , as do more recent galactic xrne . in some cases , such as the may 1989 xrne of 2023 + 338 ( v404 cyg )",
    ", the optical decay time has been observed to be shorter than the x - ray decay time ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we note that the optical decay of the source detailed in table  [ hst.dat ] at r.a.=00:44:06.81 , dec.=41:12:24.0 ( j2000 ) lies near the mean of galactic events and is consistent with theoretical models .",
    "this consistency argues in favor of the candidate being the true optical counterpart .      as discussed in @xcite , one may use the decay time of the xrn to predict the size of the accretion disk of the system",
    "this method was applied to the x - ray transient source r2 - 67 by @xcite and gave an answer consistent with the period prediction from the optical and x - ray luminosities .",
    "we calculated the size of the disk expected for a 10@xmath66 black hole with a linear decay to approximately zero x - ray flux 60 days after a peak x - ray luminosity of 2.4@xmath1810@xmath29 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "similar to the calculation for r2 - 67 in @xcite , the disk size prediction for s1 - 86 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the angular momentum transport efficiency , @xmath69 is the black hole mass in 10 @xmath66 units , and @xmath70 is the local disk temperature in units of @xmath71 k. we note that if the true peak x - ray luminosity was higher , the disk size predicted by the model would increase . if we apply the lowest possible peak x - ray luminosity , that given by the disk blackbody fit to the 09-nov-2003 data ( 9@xmath1810@xmath72 erg s@xmath10 ) , the disk size prediction is @xmath73    according to kepler s laws , the size of the orbit of the secondary is @xmath74 cm , where @xmath75 is the orbital period in days . because the disk can not be larger than the orbit of the secondary ( @xmath76 )",
    ", these calculations suggest that the orbital period of this system is @xmath201 day .",
    "this estimate of the orbital period is consistent with the prediction from the @xcite relation when the optical luminosity of the counterpart candidate is applied ( see   3.2 ) , providing some additional confidence that the candidate is the true optical counterpart .        on the other hand ,",
    "the precision of the x - ray position for s1 - 86 is not optimal .",
    "as shown in table  [ xpos ] and discussed in   [ results ] , the x - ray position errors include 50 square arcseconds of area within the 2@xmath28 error ellipse .",
    "the optical candidate is 0.8@xmath28 away from the r.a . of the x - ray position and 1.7@xmath28 away from the declination of x - ray position .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics , the optical source has @xmath179% probability of occupying the same location as the x - ray source ; however , we do not rule out the possibility that this is the counterpart because the _ chandra _ psf is known to be complicated far off - axis .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure  [ xims ] , the location of the optical counterpart candidate appears qualitatively reasonable when placed on the x - ray images of s1 - 86 .",
    "if the optical candidate is not the counterpart of the x - ray transient , the candidate must be a different type of optical source that varies by 1.3 mag in brightness .",
    "such sources are not extremely rare .",
    "we searched the overlapping portions of our 2 acs observations for other sources that became fainter by more than 1 mag between the first and second observations .",
    "we found 75 such sources in the 9.2752 square arcminutes of overlapping area .",
    "since our 2@xmath28 error ellipse covers 0.0140 square arcminutes , there is an 11% random probability of one of these sources falling in this region , similar to the probability that the candidate occupies the same position as the x - ray source .",
    "there are several types of variable sources that could show the same behavior as the counterpart candidate , including eclipsing binaries , high - amplitude variable stars , and dwarf nova systems .",
    "for example , a common type of variable with properties similar to those of the counterpart candidate is rr lyrae stars .",
    "m31 is known to have @xmath305 rr lyrae stars per square arcminute @xcite . at @xmath77 , assuming a distance modulus of 24.47 ( 780 kpc ) and foreground extinction ( @xmath78 ) , the counterpart candidate has @xmath79 , typical of rr@xmath80 lyrae stars , which can vary by 0.5@xmath811.5 mag @xcite . if the candidate is such a star , its period and phase must have allowed us to observe it near maximum during our first _",
    "observation and near minimum during our second _",
    "there were 88.8 days between our two _ hst _ observations .",
    "if this optical source is an rr@xmath80 star , its period is likely @xmath170.55 days @xcite .",
    "therefore , the star would have undergone 161.5 cycles between our observations , allowing us to observe it in opposite phases .",
    "it is clearly possible that the counterpart candidate is an unassociated variable star .",
    "we have reported the detection of a new , bright transient x - ray source in m31 , which we call s1 - 86 ( cxom31 j004406.7 + 411220 ) . after aligning the _ chandra _ acis - i images to the lgs coordinate system ,",
    "this source is located at r.a.=00:44:06.68 , dec.=41:12:20.0 with final r.a . and",
    "errors of 1.74@xmath1 and 2.31@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the x - ray spectral properties of this source as measured from 3 _ chandra _ acis - i detections are typical of known galactic xrne .",
    "power - law fits indicate a spectral index of 3 and an absorption column of 2.2@xmath1810@xmath27 @xmath9 .",
    "disk blackbody fits indicate an inner disk temperature decrease from 0.6 kev to 0.4 kev over 1 month and an absorption column of 5@xmath1810@xmath37 @xmath9 .",
    "the 0.37 kev luminosity was @xmath172.4@xmath1810@xmath29 erg s@xmath10 ( power - law ) , or @xmath170.9@xmath1810@xmath29 erg s@xmath10 ( disk blackbody ) , depending on the spectral model employed .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve exhibits a linear decay , suggesting a large accretion disk .    in two",
    "_ hst _ acs observations , we detected only one optical source within 4.5@xmath1 of the x - ray position of the xrn that faded in concert with the x - ray source .",
    "after aligning the acs images to the lgs coordinate system , this optical counterpart candidate was located at r.a.=00:44:06.81 and dec.= + 41:12:24.0 ( j2000 ) . while the optical brightness and decay timescale suggest that this optical source is the counterpart , the errors in the x - ray source position allow the possibility that the counterpart candidate is a nearby rr@xmath80 lyrae star which we observed near maximum and minimum brightness .",
    "if so , no optical counterpart was seen down to @xmath63 .",
    "if the candidate is the optical counterpart and the x - ray luminosity indicated by the power - law spectral fit is correct , then the x - ray / optical luminosity ratio yields predictions for the orbital period of the x - ray binary and the size of the accretion disk .",
    "the period prediction is 1.0@xmath57 day , and the disk size prediction is @xmath580.7@xmath82  cm .",
    "these values are on the low side of model predictions for xrne with long , linear x - ray decays , and the lower x - ray luminosity given by the disk blackbody spectral fit yields even lower values .    if the optical counterpart was not detected , it was at least 1 mag fainter than the candidate counterpart .",
    "this upper - limit to the optical luminosity provides lower - limits on the x - ray / optical luminosity ratios given by both x - ray spectral models . in both cases , these lower - limits yield upper - limits on the orbital period and the disk size that are below model predictions for xrne with long , linear x - ray decays .",
