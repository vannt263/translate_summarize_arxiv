    "<S> the rapidity - even dipolar flow @xmath0 associated with dipole asymmetry in the initial geometry is measured over a broad range in transverse momentum 0.5 gev@xmath19 gev , and centrality ( 0 - 50)% in pb - pb collisions at @xmath2 tev , recorded by the atlas experiment at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 coefficient is determined via a two - component fit of the first order fourier coefficient @xmath3 of two - particle correlations in azimuthal angle @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this fit is motivated by the finding that the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath8 data are consistent with the combined contributions from a rapidity - even @xmath0 and global momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the extracted momentum conservation component suggests that the system conserving momentum involves only a subset of the event ( spanning about 3 units in @xmath9 in central collisions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath0 is observed to cross zero at @xmath10 gev , reaches a maximum at 45 gev with a value comparable to that for @xmath11 , and decreases at higher @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the magnitude of @xmath0 at high @xmath7 exceeds the value of the @xmath11 in all centrality interval and exceeds the value of @xmath12 in central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior suggests that the path - length dependence of energy loss and initial dipole asymmetry from fluctuations corroborate to produce a large dipolar anisotropy for high @xmath7 hadrons , making the @xmath0 a valuable probe for studying the jet quenching phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the measurements of harmonic flow coefficients @xmath13 have provided valuable insights into the properties of the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients are obtained from a fourier expansion of the particle production in azimuthal angle @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the phase of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath13 coefficients are closely related to the fourier coefficients @xmath17 of the two - particle correlation ( 2pc ) in relative azimuthal angle @xmath4 : @xmath18 which in general contains contributions from both harmonic flow @xmath13 and other non - flow correlations : @xmath19 the @xmath12 coefficient , known to be associated with the elliptic shape of the overlap region , dominates in the non - central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> however , large @xmath13 values have also been measured for @xmath20  @xcite , which have been interpreted as the hydrodynamic response to the fluctuations of the matter in the initial states . the exotic ridge and mach - cone </S>",
    "<S> like structures first observed at rhic in the 2pc in @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite are naturally explained by the sum of these harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> the main sources of non - flow correlations include contributions from resonance decays , bose - einstein correlation , jets , and the global momentum conservation ( gmc ) , a source that is very important for the @xmath23 term . </S>",
    "<S> this proceedings focuses on the @xmath0 results extracted from @xmath24 by taking into account the contribution of gmc in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3 ] , using a method similar to ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the main results have been published in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    during the quark matter 2011 conference </S>",
    "<S> , all three lhc experiments demonstrated that the non - flow effects are small for @xmath25 and the factorization : @xmath26 is valid within @xmath27 ( see s. mohapatra s talk in this workshop  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> they further show that this factorization is valid as long as one of the particle has @xmath28 gev , beyond that the influence of dijet correlation becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the factorization breaks down for @xmath23 over the entire @xmath7 and @xmath9 range . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : refact1 ] , which shows the @xmath13 values calculated from @xmath17 via eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:4 ] , assuming no non - flow effect ; they are obtained for @xmath29 gev using four different reference @xmath5 ranges . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath30 are independent of reference @xmath5 for @xmath31 , while the @xmath32 values calculated this way clearly change with the choice of @xmath5 , indicating a breakdown of the factorization over the measured @xmath7 and @xmath22 range .     the values of @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 for @xmath29 gev , calculated from a reference @xmath35 in four @xmath5 ranges ( </S>",
    "<S> 0.51 , 12 , 23 , and 34 gev )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars indicate the statistical uncertainties . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for the lack of factorization for @xmath24 is that it is strongly influenced by gmc , while all higher - order coefficients conserve momentum due to their multi - fold symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> one example of gmc effects comes from dijet fragmentation in peripheral events , which tend to give a negative @xmath24 at large @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of gmc on the two - particle correlation was studied extensively  @xcite , and was shown to explicitly break the factorization relation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:4 ]  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the multiplicity and average squared transverse momentum for the whole event , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is a leading - order approximation for the gmc . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is expected to be valid when the correction term is much smaller than one . </S>",
    "<S> the gmc effect is important in peripheral events and for high @xmath7 particles , but is diluted in central events due to the large multiplicity .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the @xmath0 on @xmath9 can be generally separated into a rapidity - odd component and a rapidity - even component . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity - odd @xmath0 is thought to arise from the deflection of the colliding ions  @xcite , and changes sign from negative @xmath9 to positive @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rapidity - odd @xmath0 is generally small @xmath40 for @xmath41 at the rhic and lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding contribution to @xmath24 ( @xmath42 ) is negligible compared to the typical @xmath24 values ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity - even @xmath0 signal is argued to be associated to the dipole anisotropy of the pressure gradient arising from the dipole asymmetry of the nuclear overlap ; this dipole asymmetry is mainly due to fluctuations in the initial geometry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the rapidity - even @xmath0 depends weakly on @xmath9 , similar to the higher - order @xmath13 , eq .  [ eq : v0 ] can be simplified to : @xmath43    the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : refact1 ] indeed suggests that the @xmath24 values are independent of @xmath22 for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the @xmath24 values are integrated over @xmath45 to obtain one value for each @xmath5 and @xmath6 combination , and the resulting @xmath8 functions are shown in figure  [ fig : v1fac3 ] . in peripheral events ( @xmath46 centrality ) , the @xmath24 values are always negative and their magnitudes increase nearly linearly with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , due to the contribution from the away - side jet . in more central events , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of this negative @xmath24 component is smaller , reflecting a dilution of the gmc term by the large event multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , figure  [ fig : v1fac3 ] clearly suggests that a positive @xmath24 component sets in for @xmath47 gev . </S>",
    "<S> its magnitude increases with @xmath7 and eventually drives @xmath24 into the positive region .     </S>",

    "<S> each panel presents results in one centrality interval . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars and shaded bands represent statistical and systematic uncertainties , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the data points for the three highest @xmath5 intervals have coarser binning in @xmath6 , hence are connected by dashed lines to guide the eye . </S>",
    "<S> the data in the bottom three panels are scaled down by a factor of ten to fit within the same vertical range . ]    to extract the rapidity - even @xmath0 , a least - squares fit of the @xmath24 data is performed for each centrality interval with the following form : @xmath48\\right)^2}{\\left(\\sigma_{\\mathrm { a , b}}^{\\mathrm{stat}}\\right)^2+\\left(\\sigma_{\\mathrm { a , b}}^{\\mathrm{sys , p2p}}\\right)^2}\\;,\\\\\\label{eq : v2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the statistical and point - to - point systematic uncertainties for @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath51 function is defined via a smooth interpolation of its values at 15 discrete @xmath7 points @xmath52 ( see table  [ tab : fit ] ) , and these together with the parameter @xmath53 constitute a total of 16 fit parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this interpolation procedure is motivated by the fact that the function @xmath51 is unknown but is expected to vary smoothly with @xmath7 . in the peripheral collisions where the @xmath0 contribution is small , </S>",
    "<S> the fit is also repeated including only the gmc contribution ( i.e. removing the @xmath54 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath24 data in figure  [ fig : v1fac3 ] are plotted as a function of @xmath6 for six intervals of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the seemingly - complex patterns of the @xmath24 data in ( 0 - 5)% centrality interval are well described by the two - component fit across broad ranges of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with the dot - dashed lines indicating the estimated contributions from the gmc . </S>",
    "<S> the typical @xmath55dof of the fit is between one and two depending on the centrality , as shown in table  [ tab : fit ] . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations of the data from the fit , as shown in the bottom section of each panel , are less than @xmath56 for @xmath57 gev . above that @xmath7 and in more peripheral events the deviations increase , possibly reflecting the limitation of the leading - order approximation for the momentum conservation term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : v1 ] , or the two - component assumption in general .    </S>",
    "<S> the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : v1fit1 ] shows the fit to the @xmath24 data from figure  [ fig : v1fac3 ] for the ( 8090)% centrality interval , including only the cmc term . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with the gmc up to 10 gev in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 , well into the region where the contribution from away - side jet is expected to dominate the 2pc . </S>",

    "<S> the crossing point extracted from alice data  @xcite is significantly higher ( @xmath60 gev ) , which could be related to the fact the @xmath36 gap of 0.8 in alice data is not sufficient to fully suppress the near - side peak ( see top left panel of figure  [ fig : refact1 ] or figure 2c of  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , that calculation clearly demonstrates that both the zero crossing point and the peak value are sensitive to the shear viscosity to entropy ratio , making our precision @xmath0 measurement a valuable tool for constraining the transport properties of the medium .    at higher @xmath7 , </S>",

    "<S> the peak value increases by about 20% over the measured centrality range , also significantly larger than the increase for @xmath11 ( about @xmath62 over the same centrality range ) . </S>",
    "<S> the falloff of @xmath51 at higher @xmath7 may indicate the onset of path - length dependent jet energy loss , which correlates with the dipole asymmetry in the initial geometry to produce the large @xmath0 coefficient at high @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this falloff is slower than that for the @xmath12 and @xmath11 , with an magnitude that is surprisely larger than @xmath12 in central collisions , consistent with a finding based on jet absorption model calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these high @xmath7 behaviors suggest that our @xmath51 results also provide valuable input for understanding jet quenching phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , results in figure  [ fig : v1fit2 ] also imply that the rapidity - even collective @xmath0 is an important component of the two - particle correlation at intermediate @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the large positive @xmath24 harmonic in figure  [ fig : rec0b ] , responsible for the mach - cone like structure in the the bottom - right panel , is mainly due to the rapidity - even @xmath0 : its contribution to @xmath24 can be three times larger than the negative momentum conservation term estimated by the global fit ( top panel of figure  [ fig : v1fit1 ] ) .     </S>",
