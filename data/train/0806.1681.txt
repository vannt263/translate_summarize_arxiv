    "the investigation of the relation between feynman integrals and motives originates in the work of broadhurst and kreimer @xcite , where it is shown that zeta and multiple zeta values appear systematically in the evaluation of feynman diagrams .",
    "these are very special periods , namely they are believed to arise as periods of mixed tate motives .",
    "an important question in the field then became understanding the a priori reason for the appearance of this special class of motives in quantum field theory .",
    "surprisingly , the work of belkale and brosnan @xcite revealed a universality result for the varieties associated to feynman graphs , namely they generate the grothendieck ring of varieties .",
    "this means that , as motives , they can be arbitrarily far from the mixed tate case .",
    "the question then moved on to whether the piece of the cohomology of the graph hypersurface complement , which is involved in the evaluation of the feynman integral as a period , actually happens to be mixed tate .",
    "the recent results of @xcite , see also @xcite , analyze this problem in depth in the case of the `` wheels with n - spokes '' graphs .",
    "there are considerable technical difficulties involved in the cohomological calculations , even for relatively uncomplicated graphs , due to the singularities of the graph hypersurfaces and to the fact that generally their complexity grows very rapidly with the combinatorial complexity of the graphs .",
    "a different approach to the relation between feynman integrals and mixed tate motives was given by connes ",
    "marcolli in @xcite , from the point of view of tannakian categories and motivic galois groups .",
    "this approach originated from the earlier work of connes ",
    "kreimer @xcite where it is shown that the feynman graphs of a given physical theory form a commutative , non - cocommutative , hopf algebras .",
    "this defines dually an affine group scheme , called the group of diffeographisms of the theory , whose lie algebra bracket is given by the symmetrized insertion of one graph into another at vertices .",
    "the connes ",
    "kreimer hopf algebra structure of perturbative renormalization was extended from the case of scalar field theories to the case of qed , and more general gauge theories , by van suijlekom in @xcite .",
    "he showed that the ward identities define a hopf ideal in the connes ",

    ". a related question of motivic lifts of the connes ",
    "kreimer hopf algebra is formulated in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the graph hypersurfaces generate the grothendieck ring of varieties means that the computation of the feynman integral in terms of a period on the complement of a graph hypersurface in a projective space gives a general procedure to construct a large class of interesting varieties with associated periods .",
    "our purpose here is to show that this general procedure can be adapted to produce a large class of interesting supermanifolds with associated periods .    in the setting of @xcite and",
    "@xcite one is assuming , from the physical viewpoint , that all edges of the graph are of the same nature , as would be the case in a scalar field theory with lagrangian @xmath0 however , in more general theories , one has graphs that are constructed out of different types of edges , which correspond to different propagators in the corresponding feynman rules .",
    "we consider the case of theories with fermions , where graphs have both _",
    "fermionic _ and _ bosonic _ legs . from the mathematical point of view , it is natural to replace the usual construction of the graph hypersurface by a different construction which assigns to the edges either ordinary variables ( bosonic ) or grassmann variables ( fermionic ) .",
    "this procedure yields a natural way to construct a family of _ supermanifolds _ associated to this type of feynman graphs .",
    "we give a computation of the feynman integral in terms of a bosonic and a fermionic integration , so that the integral is computed as a period on a supermanifold that is the complement of a divisor in a superprojective space , defined by the set of zeros and poles of the berezinian of a matrix @xmath1 associated to a graph @xmath2 and a choice of a basis @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "we refer to the divisor defined by this berezinian as the graph supermanifold @xmath5 .    as in the case of the ordinary graph hypersurfaces",
    ", we are interested in understanding their motiving nature first by looking at their classes in the grothendieck ring of varieties . to this purpose",
    ", we introduce a grothendieck ring @xmath6 of supermanifold and we prove that it is a polynomial ring @xmath7 $ ] over the grothendieck ring of ordinary varieties .",
    "we then use this result to prove that the classes of the graph supermanifolds @xmath5 generate the subring @xmath8 $ ] , where the degree two appears due to a fermion doubling used in the computation of the feynman integral .    in a different perspective",
    ", an interest in supermanifolds and their periods has recently surfaced in the context of mirror symmetry , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we do not know , at present , whether the classes of supermanifolds considered here and their periods may be of any relevance to that context .",
    "we mention some points of contact in  [ mssect ] below .",
    "as the referee pointed out to us , a theory of parametric feynman integrals for scalar supersymmetric theories was developed in @xcite .",
    "the type of integrals we are considering here is slightly different from those of @xcite , hence we can not apply directly the results of that paper",

    "the supermanifold @xmath51 decomposes as a sum of the corresponding classes in the grothendieck group .",
    "the fact that the vector bundle that constitutes the fermionic part of a supermanifold is trivial when seen in the grothendieck group is the analog for supermanifolds of the fact that any projective bundle is equivalent to a product in the grothendieck group of ordinary varieties .",

    "the mirror still exists , not as a conventional khler manifold , but as a supermanifold embedded in a ( weighted ) super - projective space .",
    "for instance , in the construction given in @xcite , one considers the hypersurface in ( weighted ) projective space given by the vanishing of a superpotential @xmath413 .",

    "to ensure the vanishing of the first chern class , one corrects the superpotential @xmath415 by additional quadratic terms in either bosonic or fermionic variables , so that the condition @xmath416 defines a supermanifold embedded in a ( weighted ) super - projective space , instead of an ordinary hypersurface in projective space .",
    "in the ordinary case , one obtains the primitive part of the middle cohomology @xmath417 and its hodge decomposition via the poincar residue @xmath418 with @xmath419 a 1-cycle encircling the hypersurface @xmath42 , applied to forms of the form @xmath420 with @xmath421 , as in with @xmath422 the weights in the case of weighted projective spaces , and with @xmath423 satisfying @xmath424 .    in the supermanifold case ,",
    "one replaces the calulation of the hodge structure on the mirror done using the technique described above , by a supergeometry analog , where the forms are replaced by forms @xmath425 where here the superpotential @xmath415 is modified by the presence of an additional quadratic term in the fermionic variables @xmath426 .    in comparison to the setting discussed in this paper ,",
