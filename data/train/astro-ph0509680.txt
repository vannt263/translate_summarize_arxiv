    "sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) are commonly separated in two types : astrophysical and cosmological .",
    "the first kind of sources can produce a stochastic background which provides interesting information on the distribution of compact objects at relatively low redshifts , such as star formation and supernova rates , black - hole growth mechanisms and other important phenomena .",
    "such a background is generated by neutron stars , black holes and the associated binary systems , which emit in the frequency range @xmath2hz .",
    "( e.g @xcite ) , or by galactic merging of unresolved binary white dwarfs with frequencies in the range @xmath3hz @xcite .",
    "besides binary systems of super - massive black holes in the galaxy center , which could emit at @xmath4hz , hence detectable by lisa ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the principal example of gravitational waves of cosmological origin is represented by the relic radiation which has been generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric tensor during the inflationary era .",
    "the detection of this relic background would shed light on the physics of the very early universe , since its strain amplitude is proportional to the square of the inflation energy scale .",
    "primordial backgrounds can be generated by various mechanisms and are characterized by a large frequency interval which extends from a few @xmath5 hz to a few ghz , allowing their detection by markedly different ways of observation @xcite .",
    "one of the best strategies for detecting the relic gravitational radiation is to exploit the imprints it leaves on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy and polarization @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the cmb photons are very sensitive to primordial gws with frequencies @xmath6hz , which correspond to the comoving size of the hubble radius at last scattering , when tensor metric modes , being damped by the horizon entering , produce the largest amount of temperature quadrupole anisotropy and , consequently , by thomson scattering , the largest amount of polarization .",
    "it may be shown that the curl component in the polarization pattern , commonly known as b - mode , is excited by vector and tensor cosmological perturbations only ; therefore , if initial fluctuations are created very early , _ e.g. _ during inflation so that the vector growth is damped , _",
    "primary _ b - modes can be produced only by tensor perturbations and , therefore , a possible detection will represent the incontrovertible proof of their existence .",
    "unfortunately , there are mechanisms that can produce _ secondary _ b - modes , the principal one being represented by the gravitational lensing , _",
    "i.e. _ _ cosmic shear _ ( cs ) , which distorts the primary cmb pattern , in particular converting e- into b - modes . luckily , although comparable , b - modes from primordial gw exhibit their peak at multipoles @xmath7 , corresponding to the degree scale , while , for lensed b - modes , the peak is at @xmath8 , corresponding to the arcminute scale .",
    "nonetheless , if the energy scale of inflation is @xmath9gev , the cs - induced curl is a foreground for the @xmath10 primordial gw - induced b - polarization",
    ". this important contamination has to be removed in order to detect relic gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "however , as suggested by wmap measurements , early reionization should produce a large - angle bump in the primordial gw - induced b - modes , allowing a possibly easier detection , without confusion with the cs - induced curl .    actually , besides gravitational lensing , for cosmological models which constantly seed fluctuations in the geometry , _",
    "e.g. _ topological defects , vector metric perturbations can be huge and can produce non - negligible effects on the cmb photons as , in particular , b - mode polarization , unlike to what happens in inflationary models @xcite . on the other hand , no relevant contribution from these objects",
    "is indicated by the modern cosmological probes .    in the present paper , we are interested in the cosmological stochastic gw background produced by cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos via power transfer from scalar and possible vector perturbations to tensor metric modes , during the strongly non - linear stage of their evolution @xcite .",
    "it differs from other cosmological backgrounds , as that produced during the mildly non - linear stage @xcite , since density and velocity fields can be , in this case , highly non - linear .",
    "since the non - linear evolution of cdm halos occurs on a cosmological timescale , the produced gravitational radiation may be relevant at frequencies comparable to those of the primordial gw which affect the cmb photons and , therefore , can produce secondary cmb anisotropy and polarization , expecially b - modes , that could represent a foreground for the detection of the relic radiation .",
    "moreover , as for the case of black holes and neutron stars , the analysis of the stochastic background produced by highly non - linear cosmic structures , could bring information on their distribution , evolution , shape and composition , shedding light on many open issues .",
    "the plan of paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly outline the mathematical formalism and show the analytical formulas we use to estimate the gw output from cdm halos . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the homogeneous ellipsoid dynamics as an approximation to the halo virialization and adopt the halo mass function of ref .",
    "@xcite to describe their distribution . in sec .",
    "iv we explain the technique used for the numerical evaluation of the stochastic gw background , while in sec .  v we show and discuss our results . finally sec .",
    "vi contains our concluding remarks .",
    "the evolution of cosmological perturbations away from the linear regime is rich of several effects , such as the mode - mixing of different types of fluctuation , which not only implies that different fourier modes influence each other , but also that density perturbations act as a source for curl vector modes and gravitational waves .",
    "accordingly , cosmic structures can generate tensor metric modes during the non - linear stage of their evolution and , in particular , this mechanism applies to dark matter halos around galaxies and galaxy clusters in the highly non - linear regime .    in the present paper , adopting the mathematical formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the output in gravitational waves from cosmic structures , following their evolution from the linear to the highly non - linear level . more specifically , the evaluation of this gravitational radiation is possible on scales much larger than the schwarzschild radius of collapsing bodies , by means of a `` hybrid approximation '' @xcite of the einstein field equations , which mixes post - newtonian ( pn ) ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and second - order perturbative techniques ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) to deal with the perturbations of matter and geometry .",
    "this approach gives a more accurate description of gravitational waves generated by non - linear cdm structures than the standard second - order perturbation theory @xcite , which can only account for small deviations from the linear regime , or the newtonian quadrupole radiation @xcite ; indeed , it upgrades the weak - field limit of einstein equations to account for pn scalar and vector metric perturbations and for leading - order source terms of metric tensor modes .",
    "it provides , on small scales , a pn approximation to the source of gravitational radiation , and , on large scales , it converges to the first and second - order perturbative equations as obtained _",

    "( [ hab_quadrupole ] ) means that the quantity has to be evaluated at the retarded space - time point @xmath39 , _ i.e. _ at the source and at the emission time .",
    "recently , n - body simulations in cdm models have shown departure of the halo density profile from the spherical symmetry ( _ e.g. _ ) and suggest a triaxial shape which seems to be confirmed by optical , x - ray and lensing observations of galaxy clusters ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    consequently , according to the arguments in the previous section , cdm halos are potential sources of gravitational radiation through power injection from the gravitational potential and peculiar velocity , especially during the highly non - linear stage of their evolution",
    ", when density contrasts and velocity fields can be strongly non - linear .",
    "since the aim of this paper is to evaluate the stochastic gw background generated by a distribution of cosmic structures , in this section we will describe the model adopted to approximate their dynamics and virialization .",
    "we will use the gravitational collapse of homogeneous ellipsoids as described in ref .  , which developed a picture of cosmic structure formation that identifies virialized cosmological objects with peak patches in the initial lagrangian space .",
    "these peaks represent overdensities in the initial gaussian density field whose evolution is approximated by a homogeneous ellipsoid dynamics .",

    "<S> the current knowledge of cosmological structure formation suggests that cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos possess a non - spherical density profile , implying that cosmic structures can be potential sources of gravitational waves via power transfer from scalar perturbations to tensor metric modes in the non - linear regime . by means of a previously developed mathematical formalism and a triaxial collapse model </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically estimate the stochastic gravitational - wave background generated by cdm halos during the fully non - linear stage of their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the energy density associated with this background is comparable to that produced by primordial tensor modes at frequencies @xmath0hz if the energy scale of inflation is @xmath1 gev , and that these gravitational waves could give rise to several cosmological effects , including secondary cmb anisotropy and polarization . </S>"
