    "to illustrate our formalism , we will consider heavy baryons containing a @xmath2 quark as our primary example . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is the ground state of the `` brown muck '' in the color field of the @xmath2 quark .",
    "when a @xmath2-quark in a @xmath3 with velocity @xmath4 decays into a @xmath5-quark with velocity @xmath6 , all the `` brown muck '' notice is the change in velocity .",
    "the ground state @xmath7 in the color field of a heavy quark with velocity @xmath4 is in general not an eigenstate of the color field of a quark with a different velocity @xmath6 . in the special case of @xmath8",
    ", however , the color field is unchanged and the `` brown muck '' stay in the same state .",
    "this gives the normalization of the isgur  wise form factors at the point of zero recoil .",
    "denote the eigenstates of the `` brown muck '' in the color field of the charm quark with velocity @xmath6 by @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the ground state @xmath11 .",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath12 is proportional to the overlap of the initial and final states @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and the `` brown muck '' of @xmath15 is in the state @xmath9 .",
    "this clearly hints that @xmath16 are closely related to the weak form factors , and indeed it is the case .",
    "for example , consider the baryonic isgur - wise form factor @xmath17 , defined by @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 we immediately have @xmath22 weak form factor of excited baryons can also be obtained in a similar way . in particular , for @xmath23-wave baryons , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , for a state with orbital angular momentum @xmath26 , @xmath27 . for @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the ground state and @xmath30 for excited states .",
    "this determines the behavior of @xmath31 near the point of zero recoil .    by completeness of @xmath32",
    "we have the sum rule @xmath33 which states the conservation of probability .",
    "we will see that this is equivalent to the bjorken sum rule .",
    "traditionally @xcite , the bjorken sum rule is based on consideration the four - point function of @xmath2 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . the four - point function may be evaluated in quark language by perturbative qcd , or in hadron language in the framework of heavy quark symmetry . by duality",
    "the two results should be equal .",
    "hence , @xmath38 where @xmath39 where @xmath40 are multiplets in the heavy quark symmetry , and @xmath41 since the @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the definition of @xmath42 act on heavy quarks but not on the light degrees of freedom , we expect @xmath42 can be factorized into contributions from the heavy quark sector and those from the light degrees of freedom .",
    "the heavy quark sector will just reproduce @xmath43 , while the contribution from the light degrees of freedom can be expressed in terms of @xmath44 .",
    "hence we end up with @xmath45 after summation over all @xmath46 and canceling the common factor of @xmath47 off both sides of eq .",
    "( [ dual ] ) , we end up with @xmath48 which is just eq .",
    "( [ psr ] ) reproduced . replacing @xmath31 s with the weak form factor",
    ", the equation becomes @xmath49 which is just the usual bjorken sum rule .",
    "expanding about the point of zero recoil , the bjorken sum rule can be simplified to @xmath50 where the charge radius @xmath51 of @xmath17 is defined by @xmath52    similar analysis can be made for the meson sector . for a @xmath2-quark ,",
    "the ground states with @xmath53 are the @xmath54 and @xmath55 mesons .",
    "the formulas are more complicated , however , as the mesonic isgur ",
    "wise form factor @xmath56 is not exactly @xmath57 . in fact , it turns out that @xmath58 putting @xmath59 recovers the bjorken ",
    "suzuki upper bound of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 for the @xmath23-wave excited mesons ,    @xmath61    where the @xmath62 s are defined in the ref .",
    "in this case , eq.([psr ] ) becomes @xmath63    defining the charge radius @xmath64 of @xmath56 by @xmath65 and the bjorken sum rule is simplified to @xmath66 the extra @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ mbdr ] ) when compared to eq .",
    "( [ bbdr ] ) is intriguing . in this formalism",
    "it is clear that the @xmath67 results from the `` uncanonical '' definition of @xmath56 @xcite . if the factor of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ mfr ] ) is absorbed into the definition of @xmath56 , the equation will have the same form as eq .",
    "( [ bfr ] ) , and the @xmath69 will not appear in the expansion .",
    "returning to eq . ( [ psr ] ) , it is noted that a more general sum rule holds for an arbitrary operator @xmath70 : @xmath71 in particular , if we put @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ msr ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ psr ] ) is recovered .",
    "another case of interest is when @xmath73 the hamiltonian in the color field of a heavy quark with velocity @xmath6 . without loss of generality",
    "we choose the _ final _ velocity @xmath74",
    ". then @xmath75 are just the excitation energies of the resonances @xmath15 . for the ground state ,",
    "@xmath76 in the meson sector and @xmath77 in the baryon sector .",
    "the right - handed side @xmath78 is the energy expectation for a moving ground state `` brown muck '' under the color field of a stationary heavy quark of velocity @xmath6 . by",
    "dimensional analysis we know that @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a kinematic factor which depends on @xmath81 only .",
    "hence the whole sum rule reads as @xmath82    the functional form of @xmath80 can be obtained in some definite scenarios .",
    "for example , if we can regard @xmath83 as completely kinetic , then @xmath80 is just the lorentzian boost factor @xmath84 , which is just @xmath81 .",
    "a more realistic scenario sees @xmath83 with two parts : the mass of the `` brown muck '' in @xmath6 frame and the potential energy of the `` brown muck '' in the color field of a heavy quark with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "if we ignore the quantum fluctuation of the color field , i.e , the heavy quark is a classical , static source , we can choose the color potential of the heavy quark such that @xmath85 the potential energy is of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the color current density of the `` brown muck '' and @xmath88 being the @xmath89 index .",
    "by symmetry we have , @xmath90 where @xmath91 , the component of @xmath87 transverse to @xmath92 , is radially symmetric . on integration , this transverse term vanishes by radial symmetry , and @xmath93 hence when the `` brown muck '' is boosted from @xmath6 to @xmath4 , the potential energy is increased by just the lorentzian factor @xmath81 . since the mass of the `` brown muck '' also increases by the same factor under boost , we have @xmath94 , i.e , @xmath95 if we assume the color field of the heavy quark is purely classical .",
    "it is probable that the statement is still valid if we take into account the effects due to quantum fluctuation , though the author has not yet succeeded in proving it .",
    "if we assume @xmath96 then eq . ( [ esr ] ) becomes @xmath97 which can be recasted into @xmath98 the quantity @xmath99 is just the mass difference over the ground state .",
    "in particular it is zero for @xmath100 , i.e , the term proportional to the isgur  wise form factors vanishes .    for the meson sector , @xmath101 .",
    "substituting in the weak form factors , we obtain @xmath102 canceling @xmath103 off both sides , and putting @xmath104 , the sum rule becomes @xmath105 which is just the voloshin sum rule derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , in the baryonic sector , @xmath106 , and",
    "the sum rule reads as @xmath107 the authors are not aware of any previous appearance of this sum rule in the literature , except for ref .",
    "@xcite , where this sum rule is obtained in the large @xmath108 limit .",
    "in fact , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite can be reproduced in our formalism by choosing a definite potential energy function , namely the isotropic harmonic potential @xmath109 .",
    "in this section , we will consider the case when we put @xmath110 , the parity operator in the @xmath6 frame , into eq .",
    "( [ msr ] ) .",
    "the left - handed side becomes @xmath111 ; where @xmath112 are the intrinsic parities of @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath113 up to a phase is a ground state `` brown muck '' in the color field of a heavy quark with velocity @xmath114 ; hence the right - handed side of eq .",
    "( [ msr ] ) becomes @xmath115 , @xmath116 . as result ,",
    "( [ msr ] ) is simplified to @xmath117 this sum rule is remarkable in the sense that it relates form factors at two different kinematic points , @xmath81 and @xmath118 .    together with the bjorken sum rule eq.([psr ] ) we have @xmath119 the @xmath120 above the summation means that the sum runs over the states with the same parity as the ground states only . denoting the contribution to the sum from excited states as @xmath121 , the sum rule reads @xmath122 since @xmath123 is the isgur  wise form factors up to possibly a known kinematic factor , a bound on @xmath121 may give a model - independent bound on the isgur  wise form factors .",
    "since @xmath121 is a sum of absolute squares , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 we will change the independent variable from @xmath81 to the `` boost angle '' @xmath126 , which is related to @xmath81 by @xmath127 .",
    "we will also change the dependent variable from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , which is related to @xmath128 by @xmath130 .",
    "this greatly simplifies the equation as @xmath131 and @xmath132 hence eq .",
    "( [ lb1 ] ) becomes @xmath133 we expect @xmath134 to be a decreasing function .",
    "( [ lb2 ] ) implies @xmath135 since isgur  wise form factors are continuous , this simply states that @xmath129 is also a decreasing function .",
    "moreover , since @xmath134 is expected to be nodeless and approaches zero as @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) , we have @xmath138 @xmath139 finally , the boundary condition at @xmath104 ( @xmath140 ) can be given in terms of the derivative of the isgur  wise form factor at the point of zero recoil . @xmath141 the unique maximal @xmath129 satisfying the conditions above is @xmath142 putting into the original form of @xmath123 , a model - independent lower bound for @xmath123 can be obtained .",
    "@xmath143 this is a lower bound for all possible forms of @xmath123 _ with the same @xmath144_.    since @xmath145 in the baryon sector , the lower bound above can be applied to the baryon case directly .",
    "plots of @xmath146 for different @xmath144 are shown in fig .",
    "this lower bound rules out some particular forms of @xmath17 like the piecewise linear model @xmath147 it is known that , in the large @xmath108 limit , the baryonic isgur  wise form factor has an exponential form @xcite , @xmath148 while our lower bound , in a taylor series , is @xmath149 in the large @xmath108 limit , @xmath150 is large , and the bound is satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , the mesonic isgur  wise form factor @xmath56 is given by the slightly more complicated eq .",
    "( [ mfr ] ) .",
    "hence , the lower bound for @xmath56 is @xmath151 plots of @xmath152 for different @xmath144 are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    expanding in a taylor series , we have @xmath153 when compared with the isgw @xcite , bsw @xcite and pole @xcite parametrizations of the mesonic isgur  wise form factor ,",
    "@xmath154 @xmath155 @xmath156 we found that , in order to satisfy the lower bound , we must have @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath159 , on the other hand , does not satisfy the bound for all values of @xmath160 .",
    "last of all , it s also worth mentioning once more that the bjorken ",
    "suzuki upper bound of @xmath56 , which is given in eq .",
    "( [ bb ] ) , can be recovered by putting the obvious inequality @xmath161 into eq .",
    "( [ mfr ] ) .",
    "the counterpart of this upper bound in the baryon sector is the trivial statement @xmath162 .    in the paper , we have discussed the bjorken , voloshin , and parity sum rules within the same framework .",
    "this is not meant to be a rigorous derivation ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but just an intuitive picture making the relationship between the sum rules and the conservation laws behind them more transparent .",
    "we have treated the case for heavy mesons and the @xmath163-type baryons , but similar analysis can be made in the @xmath164-type baryon sector @xcite as well .",
    "i must thank mark wise for bringing the bjorken sum rule to my attention , and ming lu for the voloshin sum rule .",
