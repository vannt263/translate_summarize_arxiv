    "the brans  dicke field is not driven by matter and we have the same integral for @xmath59 as in the vacuum case , although we have a different @xmath84 : @xmath249 the evolution of @xmath98 is thus the same as for the vacuum case if we replace the function @xmath243 by @xmath250 note that in spatially flat or closed models as @xmath104 we find @xmath251 , i.  e.  @xmath0 approaches a fixed value .",
    "in open models as @xmath171 we have @xmath252 .",
    "on the other hand at early times these solutions approach the vacuum solutions as @xmath253 amounts simply to a rescaling of the conformal time or , equivalently , the scale factor .",

    "it has long been realised that a theory with varying gravitational coupling such as scalar ",
    "tensor gravity must be equivalent to one in which the gravitational coupling is constant but masses and lengths vary  @xcite .",
    "mathematically this equivalence can be shown by using a conformally rescaled metric @xmath258 @xmath141 is just an arbitrary constant introduced to keep the conformal factor dimensionless . written in terms of this new metric and its scalar curvature , @xmath259 , the scalar  tensor action given in eq .",

    "the field equations are then , at least in vacuum ( @xmath270 ) , just the usual einstein field equations of general relativity plus a massless scalar field , @xmath265 . in particular , in a frw universe ( which remains homogeneous and isotropic under the homogeneous transformation ) we have @xmath271 where the scale factor in the conformal frame @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",

    "@xmath277 the equations of motion for the conformal scale factor written in terms of @xmath57 and for @xmath265 written in terms of @xmath105 and derivatives with respect to the conformal time @xmath48 are then precisely eqs .",

    "these results are independent of the form of @xmath1 .",
    "a particular choice of @xmath1 determines how @xmath0 is related to the stiff fluid field @xmath265 . to obtain @xmath98 we must be able to perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eyphipsi ] ) , and thus we also obtain the scale factor in the original frame , @xmath279 .      if we include the matter lagrangian for a perfect fluid in the original scalar  tensor frame , then there is a non ",

    "@xmath280 thus the matter energy  momentum tensor , defined in the einstein metric , @xmath281 is no longer independently conserved , @xmath282 unless it is traceless , i.e. vacuum or radiation . the conformally transformed density , @xmath283 , and pressure , @xmath284 , of the fluid become dependent on @xmath0 and thus @xmath265 , so while the fluid retains the same barotropic equation of state it is no longer a perfect fluid in general . note however that the overall energy  momentum tensor of the matter plus the @xmath265 field must be conserved as guaranteed in general relativity by the ricci identity .",
    "we have the usual general relativistic equations of motion in a frw model @xmath285 and the interaction leads to a transfer of energy between the original fluid and the stiff ( @xmath265 ) fluid : @xmath286    again we find two cases in which the problem simplifies .",
    "firstly for radiation ( @xmath287 ) there is no interaction and both continuity equations can be directly integrated and the conformal picture contains two non  interacting fluids : @xmath288 this is precisely the case considered recently by barrow  @xcite ( although without explicitly invoking the conformal frame ) and discussed in section  [ srad ] .",
    "the second case in which we can find exact solutions is where the original fluid is itself a stiff fluid ( or massless scalar field ) in which case although there is an interaction between the two fluids , their combined dynamical effect is that of a single perfect stiff fluid , in this case , their total pressure must be equal to their total density . ] , or",
    "massless scalar field @xmath289 say : @xmath290 this is why we find exactly the same equation of motion for the scale factor in the conformal frame , @xmath291 , in the stiff fluid case as in the vacuum case .",
    "notice now that in the conformal frame we must have @xmath292 for a positive energy density .",
    "the non  singular solutions found when @xmath204 and @xmath189 with a stiff fluid in the jordan frame correspond to solutions with negative enrgy density in the einstein frame .",
    "the continuity equation for the original fluid can always be integrated to give @xmath293 and so in the stiff fluid case we have @xmath294 we have @xmath291 as a function of @xmath48 and we must now perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ ezphi ] ) to obtain @xmath98 .",
    "the change in the relation between @xmath0 and the total stiff fluid density in the einstein frame compared with the vacuum case is equivalent to a different choice of @xmath1 ( which relates @xmath0 to @xmath265 ) as demonstrated in eq .",
    "( [ estiffvac ] ) .",
    "the vacuum case can of course be seen as a special case amongst the stiff fluid solutions , where @xmath295 , and thus @xmath296 .",
    "we can also obtain exact solutions for radiation _ and _ stiff fluid in the original jordan frame as the radiation remains decoupled in the einstein frame and the interaction is solely between the two stiff fluids in that frame .",
    "thus the equation of motion for the scale factor in the conformal frame is exactly the same as in the radiation only case , eq .",
    "( [ exrad ] ) , while the equation for @xmath0 is the same as in the stiff fluid case , eq .",
    "( [ ezphi ] ) .      to solve for the evolution of brans  dicke models ( where @xmath297constant ) in the presence of both radiation and a stiff fluid , the conformal frame is particularly useful as the evolution of the conformal scale factor , or @xmath298 , is exactly the same as for radiation only ( eq .  ( [ exrad ] ) ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 then follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ erhohat ] ) as @xmath299 so that , from the definition of @xmath265 in eq .  ( [ defpsi ] ) , @xmath300 = \\pm \\ln\\left|\\frac{\\gamma\\tau}{a+\\gamma\\tau}\\right| + { \\rm constant } \\ ; .\\ ] ] rewriting this to give @xmath0 and thus @xmath301 yields @xmath302 where @xmath303 @xmath304 is a constant of integration and @xmath122 . thus the behaviour is very similar to that seen for stiff fluid only , except that the variable @xmath305 takes the place of @xmath89 .    unlike @xmath89 , @xmath306constant at late times for @xmath42 ( where @xmath251 ) as well as for @xmath204 ( where @xmath252 ) .",
    "thus the brans  dicke field becomes frozen in at late times in the flat frw universe , dominated by the friction due to hubble expansion driven by radiation , just as it is in the open frw model where the expansion becomes driven by the curvature . only in the closed universe",
    "does the dynamical effect of the stiff fluid remain important .",
    "note however that the radiation delays the recollapse which occurs at @xmath307 .",
    "this means that @xmath308 becomes negative , but the solution is still well behaved as @xmath309 and both the conformal einstein and jordan ( for @xmath118 ) scale factors recollapse , @xmath57,@xmath80 , when @xmath310 , as @xmath311 .",
    "notice once again that the presence of a stiff fluid in the jordan frame just leads to solutions which would be obtained in the absence of the stiff fluid but with the modified @xmath199 given in eq .",
    "( [ estiffvac ] ) .",
    "we have shown how to extend the procedure recently proposed by barrow@xcite to obtain the solutions for general @xmath1 scalar  tensor gravity theories with a stiff fluid in addition to vacuum or radiation solutions in a frw metric .",
    "these two non  vacuum cases correspond to the extreme long and short wavelength modes respectively of a minimally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "we show that these solutions can be obtained due to the particularly simple evolution of the corresponding scale factor in the conformally related einstein frame which is independent of the form of @xmath1 .    in the presence of a stiff fluid",
    "the scale factor evolves like a scalar ",
    "tensor cosmology with a modified @xmath312 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ estiffvac ] ) .",
    "this is because introducing a new scalar field modifies the relation between @xmath0 and the total energy density in the homogeneous scalar fluid .",
    "for example the brans  dicke model ( @xmath313constant ) in the presence of a stiff fluid evolves like a vacuum model with @xmath314 .",
    "this significantly modifies the evolution of the brans  dicke field leading to an upper bound of @xmath315 .",
    "we find that even for functions @xmath1 that diverge at a finite value of @xmath0 , this need not be a stable late time attractor for @xmath42 models , in contrast to damour and nordvedt s rule@xcite that @xmath45 is a cosmological attractor . instead ( due to the absence of the damping effect of matter with @xmath9 , required by damour and nordvedt s result ) we find that the late ( or early ) time attractor in vacuum , as @xmath316 ( or @xmath80 ) , is associated with the divergence of the function @xmath317 . in the presence of a stiff fluid",
    "the function @xmath318 must diverge as @xmath80 or @xmath194 .",
    "the stiff fluid solutions are expected to be of primary importance as the scale factor @xmath80 . when spatial curvature is negligible ( @xmath42 ) , the condition necessary for a turning point , @xmath202 , in the stiff fluid cosmology is simply @xmath206 where @xmath182 and @xmath56 are positive constants of integration . in vacuum",
    "this reduces to @xmath319 and the sign of @xmath0 is irrelevant . in the conformally related einstein frame",
    "we have seen that the evolution is simply that for a stiff fluid irrespective of the form of @xmath1 and thus singularities are always present here provided @xmath58 . only for @xmath60",
    "does the energy density of the stiff fluid in the einstein frame become negative and so non  singular behaviour becomes possible .",
