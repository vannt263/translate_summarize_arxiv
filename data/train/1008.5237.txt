    "among the various proposals and schemes advanced for realiable quantum computing architectures  @xcite , semiconductor double quantum dots ( dqds ) are considered very promising candidates for the realization of quantum bits and gates  @xcite .",
    "indeed , these structures can arbitrarily be scaled to large systems and could be easily integrable with other microlectronic devices .",
    "besides their potentialities in the frame of quantum information science , dqds are also very interesting from the basic physics point of view , as they enable both to analyze the peculiar features of electron transport phenomena , and to relate them to the appearance of quantum correlations  @xcite .",
    "a number of implementations of dqds qubits have been investigated from the theoretical and experimental points of view  @xcite .",
    "two degrees of freedom , spin and charge , can be used to encode the qubit . while the feasibility of quantum logic gates acting on spin states is hampered by the need of local magnetic fields  @xcite",
    ", state - of - the - art nanofabrication technology  @xcite allows for a precise control of the local charge and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , shinkay _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have realized the coherent manipulation of charge states in two spatially separated dqds integrated in a gaas / algaas heterostructure .",
    "specifically , multiple two - qubit operations , such as the controlled - rotation and the swap , have been successfully implemented .",
    "the main threat to the correct functioning of quantum information processing devices is represented by the decoherence stemming from the interaction with the external environment or , from a different perspective , by the uncontrolled entanglement of the qubits with the environment . for charge states in semiconductor dqds",
    ", the loss of coherence is mainly due to the coupling of the carriers to the crystal lattice vibrations and to the coulomb interaction with other charged particles  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the decoherence induced by the electron - phonon interaction has been widely investigated in the literature  @xcite , where the quantum dots ( qds ) are usually considered as two point - like systems with two energy levels coupled to the phonon bath .",
    "analytical estimations of the decoherence effects and of their characteristic timescales have been given by using various techniques , ranging from the born - markov approximation  @xcite to perturbative calculations in a non - markovian regime  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the role played by the coulomb interaction between charge carriers into the loss of coherence has not been deeply analyzed .    in this paper , we intend to investigate the entanglement properties of bound electrons in a gaas dqd when other electron pass through the structure . in particular , we focus on the appearance of quantum correlations in a three - particle scattering , where charged particles incoming from a lead enter , one at a time , in a dqd structure and interact via coulomb potential with two electrons , one in each dot . in our scheme , the electrons crossing the device have the double role of entanglement `` mediator '' between the two dots and between the dqds system and the leads , i.e. the environment .",
    "the aim of this work is to show how the coulomb interaction between the system and the `` mediator '' can be , under certain conditions , a suitable means to entangle or disentangle in a controlled way the qubit states encoded in the single - particle energy levels of the dots .",
    "a detailed theoretical estimation of such effects results to be of interest also for the experimental feasibility of the above qubit , as the results reached in the production , manipulation , and coherent control of charge states in dqds seem to indicate  @xcite . in this view",
    "the entanglement / disentanglement of the dqds can be connected to the precise engineering or the suitable tuning of physical and geometrical parameters , such as the dqds level spacing or the current intensity , here modelled as the successive injection of carriers in the scattering region .",
    "the numerical procedure used to solve the model is a generalization of the quantum transmitting boundary method ( qtbm )  @xcite .",
    "it allows us to find the reflection and transmission amplitudes of each scattering channel as a function of the initial kinetic energy of the incoming carrier and of the state occupation of the dots .",
    "our analysis is time - independent , in the sense that the few - particle scattering states are obtained by the solution of a time - independent open - boundary schrdinger equation , and therefore does not permit to evaluate the dynamics and the characteristic timescales of quantum correlations  @xcite . on the other hand , the qtbm takes explicitely into account the spatial structure and therefore the size and the shape of the dots , thus permitting to overcome the approximations implied in the description of a dot in terms of a two - level point - like system .",
    "we single - out the peculiar mechanisms of electron transport through dqds resulting in resonances in the transmission and reflection spectra and thus leading to entanglement and decoherence  @xcite . in the evaluation of such effects ,",
    "both the transmitted and reflected components of the scattered wavefunction are taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ physicalsys ]",
    ", we introduce the physical system reproducing a dqd structure in gaas , and illustrate the computational approach adopted to find the few - particle scattering states .",
    "the description of the dqd in terms of a two - qubit model and the discussion about the theoretical procedures used to evaluate the entanglement and the decoherence are given in section  [ twoqu ] .",
    "in section  [ results ] , we show the numerical results first obtained for the scattering of a single carrier , then for a weak electric current . for the latter case , the condition leading to the maximum entanglement production or to the complete disentanglement are analyzed in detail . finally , in section  [ conclu ]",
    "we comment on the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in our model ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , we consider an electron incoming from the left , with respect to the dqd one dimensional ( 1d ) structure , with kinetic energy @xmath0 .",
    "we examine the case of one scattered carrier at a time , i.e. we suppose that an electron enters the scattering region only after the previous one has already left .",
    "such an assumption , and the fact that the charging energy of the dqd is larger than the spacing between the two - particle energy levels , means that our system always operates in three - particle regime .",
    "the incident particle is scattered via coulomb interaction by the two electrons bound in a structure potential @xmath1 in a region of length @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) mimicking a dqd structure and constituted by two potential wells separated by a potential barrier wide enough to make negligible the coulomb interaction between the two confined particles . moreover ,",
    "the structure is connected to external leads kept at zero potential .",
    "the @xmath3 two - particle bound states and energies of the dqd will be indicated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ( with @xmath60 indicating the ground state ) . as it will be shown in the following ,",
    "some of them can also be expressed in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 indicates the single - particle bound state of the right ( left ) dot with energy @xmath10 . due to the symmetry of the potential @xmath1 , @xmath11 .",
    "profile of the potential @xmath12 in the scattering region of length @xmath2=100 nm : the two potential wells are 110 mev deep and 30 nm wide and are separated by a 20 nm barrier .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the single - particle energy levels @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 of the ground , the first and second excited state of the dots respectively , with @xmath13=-105.6 mev,@xmath14=-92.5 , and @xmath15=-71.5 mev . with our parameters the levels @xmath15 ( and above )",
    "are found to have negligible occupancy . in our numerical calculations",
    "we take @xmath16=0.067 @xmath17 , with @xmath18 indicating the bare mass electron , and @xmath19=12.9 . ]",
    "as anticipated , we restrict our investigation to a 1d analysis . such an assumption , needed to solve numerically the few - particle problem with open boundaries , is physically reasonable if the transverse dimension of the structure is small compared with the other length scales . in this case",
    ", all the particles can be supposed to occupy the lowest single - particle transverse subband  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider for the incoming electrons only energies below the ionization threshold of the dqd .",
    "this means that when the outgoing electrons leave the scattering region , either reflected or transmitted , the confined particles remain in a bound state of the dqd .",
    "the three - particle hamiltonian @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath16 are the dielectric constant and effective mass of the gaas , respectively .",
    "the term describing the mutual interaction between particles in the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ ham ] ) is a screened coulomb potential with a debye length @xmath26 , here taken significantly larger than the characteristics length of the structure .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb term also accounts for the transversal dimension @xmath27 of the confined system ( with @xmath27=1 nm ) through a cut - off term . in our approach ,",
    "the fermionic nature of the carriers is explicitly accounted for by antisymmetrizing the two- and three - particle wavefunctions @xmath28 and @xmath29 for any two - particle exchange .",
    "it is worth noting that the hamiltonian given in equation  ( [ ham ] ) does not include spin - orbit terms . as a consequence ,",
    "since the orbital wavefunction is antisymmetric , we are simulating a three - particle system with a symmetric spin component , as in the case of three spin - up ( or spin - down ) electrons .",
    "furthermore , we do not include electron - phonon interaction .",
    "infact , the aim of our work is to investigate the role played by the coulomb interaction among the electrons in the system into the appearance of entanglement and decoherence .",
    "our device is supposed to operate at a temperature in mk regime , where only spontaneous emission is effective and ignoring the coupling of the electrons with the surrounding crystal lattice does not constitute a crucial approximation , as we will describe in the following . in gaas - based structures with levels",
    "splitting of few mev , single - phonon processes lead to an excited - state lifetime of the order of 10@xmath30 s , while multi - phonon and multi - electron processes are orders of magnitude less frequent ( see references  @xcite ) . given a kinetic energy of 15 mev , a single electron traverse our 100 nm long device in about 10@xmath31 s. if we suppose independent electrons injected from the lead at a mean rate of one every 10@xmath32 s , corresponding to a current of about 0.16 @xmath33a , 100 carriers can be scattered through the double - dot before a phonon - induced relaxation takes place . as a consequence , in the following sections where we consider a weak electric current",
    ", we will limit our calculation up to 60 electrons .",
    "the scattering states of the three particles are obtained by solving the time - independent open - boundary schrdinger equation @xmath34 in the cubic domain @xmath35 with @xmath36 $ ] and with the hamiltonian @xmath20 given in equation  ( [ ham ] ) . for this purpose",
    ", we applied a few - particle generalization of the so - called qtbm  @xcite , allowing one to include proper open - boundary conditions for each edge of the domain .",
    "these describe the particle coming from the left as a plane wave with energy @xmath0 and wavevector @xmath37 while the other two electrons are set in a two - particle bound state @xmath38 of the dqd with energy @xmath39 . moreover , to account for the exchange symmetry of the three - particle wavefunction , also the antisymmetry of the boundary conditions is imposed , as shown in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the correlated scattering state when the particle @xmath40 is localized in the left lead ( that is @xmath41 ) reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the index of the initial two - particle dqd state .",
    "analogously , when the particles 2 and 3 are in the left lead , the boundary conditions are @xmath44=@xmath45 and @xmath46= @xmath47 , respectively . in the above expression @xmath48=@xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the kinetic energy of an electron freely propagating in the lead , as obtained by energy conservation @xmath51 . for sake of simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath52=1 here and in the following .",
    "the first term appearing in the r.h.s of equation  ( [ refl ] ) describes electron 1 incoming from the left lead as a plane wave with energy @xmath0 , while the other electrons are in the two - particle bound state @xmath53 .",
    "the second term represents the linear combination of all the energetically - allowed possibilities when particle 1 is reflected back as a plane wave with wave vector @xmath48 and the dqd is in the state @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 indicates the number of states for which @xmath56 .",
    "the last term accounts for those states with @xmath50 negative , which describe particle 1 as an evanescent wave in the left lead .",
    "therefore , the coefficients @xmath57 are the transition amplitudes between the initial state @xmath58 and the final state @xmath59 when the incoming carrier is reflected .",
    "if particle 1 is in the right lead , the three - particle wavefunction takes a form similar to expression  ( [ refl ] ) , which describes the outgoing travelling and evanescent modes of the electron in the right lead ( @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 while @xmath62=@xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65= + @xmath66 for @xmath67 the coefficients @xmath68 describe the transition amplitudes in the @xmath6-th channel , i.e. when the bound particles are in the @xmath6-th state of the dqd .",
    "the boundary conditions are given by equations  ( [ refl ] ) and ( [ trasm ] ) with @xmath69=0 and @xmath69=@xmath2 .",
    "they are coupled to the schrdinger equation and discretized by a finite - difference method .",
    "a system of seven equations is obtained , whose numerical solution provides the unknown coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath68 , and the three - particle wavefunction @xmath29 in the internal points .",
    "as a consequence of the scattering , quantum correlations between the single - particle energy levels of the bound electrons and the energies of the scattered electron appear .",
    "they are responsible both for the loss of quantum coherence of the two - particle state of the dqd and for the building up of quantum entanglement between the two dots .",
    "first , we show that under some approximations the dqd system can be reduced to a two - qubit model .",
    "then , we describe in detail the theoretical approach used to evaluate entanglement and decoherence in such a model .",
    "although the fermionic nature of the carriers has been explicitly taken into account , as shown in section  [ physicalsys ] , in order to solve numerically the physical system , we do not use entanglement criteria for identical particles  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the scattered carrier , either transmitted or reflected , can be assumed to be far from the scattering region , while the bound particles are essentially trapped into two deep potential wells far away from each other .",
    "so the spatial overlap between the particles results to be negligible .",
    "therefore , the position variables can be used to distinguish the particles , while quantum correlations are evaluated between scattering channels @xcite . by moving from spatial to energy representation for the quantum states , and taking as input state @xmath70=@xmath71 , which describes the carrier incoming from the left lead with kinetic energy @xmath0 and the particles bound with energy @xmath72",
    ", the output @xmath73 reads @xmath74 where the coefficients @xmath75 are given by @xmath76 , and the analogous expression holds for @xmath77 , while @xmath78 indicates the state with the carrier reflected ( transmitted ) as a plane wave ( with kinetic energy @xmath79 ) and the other two electrons bound in @xmath54 with energy @xmath80 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the above expression we have omitted the reflected and transmitted outgoing evanescent modes , since their contribution to the total current is zero and can not be responsible of any entanglement .",
    "so far , we considered the case of the injection of a single carrier in the scattering region when the two particles trapped in the dqd structure are described by a pure state .",
    "let us now examine the injection of a second electron also with kinetic energy @xmath0 in the scattering region , occurring after the exit of the previous one from the dqd structure via transmission or reflection .",
    "we indicate as @xmath81 and @xmath82 the first and the second injected electron , respectively .",
    "when @xmath82 enters the dqd , the bound electrons are not in a two - particle pure state , since they are coupled to the energy levels of the carrier @xmath81 , as shown by equation  ( [ phiout ] ) .",
    "therefore , the scattering between the electron @xmath82 and the other two bound in the dqd , will give the four - particle state @xmath83 where @xmath84=@xmath85 and @xmath86 has the same meaning of @xmath87 but refers to the second scattered particle , i.e. electron @xmath82 .",
    "as more electrons are scattered , the output state describing the system involves more and more terms corresponding to the various scattering channels . for the sake of simplicity , here we only describe the theoretical procedure used to calculate entanglement and decoherence in the case of the injection of a single carrier . in the subsection",
    "[ currele ] , the evaluation of decoherence and entanglement due to the interaction with a large number of injected carriers ( mimicking an electric current ) will be given for a specific case .    in order to compute the non - separability degree of the dqd system into the product of single - particle states of the dots , that is the dot - dot entanglement",
    ", we have to move from the description of the the dqd in terms of two - particle bound states to the description in terms of single - particle bound states of the left and right dots .",
    "thanks to the negligible coulomb interaction between the two dots of figure  [ fig1 ] , the four lowest two - particle orbital states @xmath88 can be written in terms of single - particle states @xmath89 and @xmath90 , of the right and left dot , respectively ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    ".[tab1 ] the table displays the scalar product @xmath91 for some values of @xmath92 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in particular , @xmath93 is the product of the ground states of the two dots , while @xmath94 and @xmath95 are degenerate , being each a linear superposition of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which represent one electron in the ground state of one dot and the other in the first excited state of the other .",
    "@xmath98 corresponds to the first excited states of the two dots .",
    "states with two electrons in the same dot are included in our calculations but have always a negligible occupancy .",
    "this means that the coefficients @xmath75 , and @xmath77 with @xmath99 or @xmath100 on the right hand side of the equation  ( [ phiout ] ) are 0 . for our numerical calculations",
    ", we used the physical parameters of the gaas material and the dqd potential reported in the caption of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in fact , we restrict our analysis to energies of the incoming particle which enable up to four scattering channels , i.e. the maximum value of @xmath55 in the expression  ( [ phiout ] ) is 3 . under these assumptions a system of two qubits is obtained , in the sense that each confined particle can be described in terms of two states : the ground @xmath101 and first excited @xmath102 energy level of the left ( right ) qd , encoding the @xmath103 and @xmath104 states , respectively .",
    "thus , the three - particle quantum state of equation  ( [ phiout ] ) can be written as : @xmath105 where @xmath106=@xmath107 and @xmath108=@xmath109 , deriving from @xmath110=@xmath111 and energy conservation has been taken into account .",
    "the decoherence undergone by the electrons confined in the dots can be interpreted in terms of the lack of knowledge of their quantum state due to the interaction with the environment , namely the injected carrier  @xcite .",
    "in other words , due to the coupling between the energy states stemming from the scattering event , the two - particle dqd can not be described by a pure state anymore but becomes a statistical mixture . a good measure of the degree of uncertainty about such a system and therefore of its loss of coherence , is given by the von neumann entropy of the two particle reduced density matrix @xmath112 , obtained by tracing the three - particle density matrix @xmath113 over the degrees of freedom @xmath114 of the scattered carrier  @xcite .",
    "after the first scattering , the matrix representation of @xmath112 in the standard basis @xmath115 reads @xmath116 where @xmath117 in order to obtain the expression  ( [ rx ] ) , the orthogonality relations between the states of the scattered carrier , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , have been used .",
    "the decoherence @xmath120 can be evaluated by means of the von neumann entropy as : @xmath121= - |\\alpha|^2 \\ln { | \\alpha|^2}- \\eta_+            \\ln { \\eta_+ } -\\eta_- \\ln { \\eta_- } - |\\omega|^2 \\ln {              |\\omega|^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath122 it ranges from 0 to @xmath123 .",
    "for @xmath120=@xmath124 the two bound particles can be found in a single energy level and this implies that no correlation is build up between them and the scattered carrier .",
    "when the decoherence reaches its maximum , the dqd is found in a statistical mixture of the three allowed energies @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 with equal weight ( @xmath128 is equal to @xmath126 ) .",
    "this implies that the uncertainty about the system is maximum .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath112 describing the bound particles is also used to evaluate the dot - dot entanglement through wootters concurrence @xmath129 .",
    "@xcite the latter is adopted to quantify the quantum correlations appearing between two qubits which can not be described by a pure two - qubit state because of their coupling with an external environment , like in our scenario .",
    "@xmath129 is obtained from the density matrix @xmath112 of the two - qubit system as  @xcite : @xmath130 where @xmath131 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath132 arranged in decreasing order . here",
    "@xmath133 is the pauli matrix @xmath134 in the basis @xmath135 , and @xmath136 describes the complex conjugation of @xmath112 in the standard basis @xmath137 .",
    "the concurrence varies from @xmath129=0 for a disentangled state to @xmath129=1 for a maximally entangled state .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath112 given in equation  ( [ rx ] ) shows an @xmath138 structure , that is it contains non - zero elements only along the main diagonal and anti - diagonal . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for such a class of density matrices the concurrence can be easily evaluated and in the case of @xmath112 it becomes : @xmath139 where @xmath140 @xmath129 is equal to 0 for @xmath141 , while it reaches its maximum value 1 if and only if @xmath142=1 and @xmath143=@xmath144=0 ( and therefore the coefficients @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 vanish ) . in the latter case",
    ", the two - qubit system reduces to a bell - like state @xmath149 .",
    "here we analyze our numerical results on the decoherence @xmath120 undergone by the dqd system and the dot - dot entanglement @xmath129 .",
    "we stress again that the former corresponds to the entanglement of the dqd electrons with the transmitted / reflected one , while the latter is the concurrence between the two bound electrons . in order to single - out the specific mechanisms leading to the appearance of quantum correlations ,",
    "the transmission and reflection spectra have been examined .",
    "the system has been solved for the potential profile @xmath12 sketched in figure  [ fig1 ] for various input states with different energy of the incoming carrier @xmath0 . in the top - left and bottom - left panels of figure  [ fig2 ] we report the modulus of the transmission ( tcs ) and",
    "reflection coefficients ( rcs ) of the various scattering channels ( that correspond the energy levels of the two - particle dqds system ) for the input states @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , when the incoming electron is injected with a kinetic energy ranging from 13 to 19 mev .",

    "right panels : modulus of the tc and rc of the channels @xmath93 and @xmath95 against @xmath0 close to the resonant energy @xmath155 for the input states @xmath156 ( top ) , and @xmath157 ( bottom ) . ]    we recall that the two - dot excited state @xmath95 can be written in terms of the qubit states as @xmath158 , i.e. it is a bell state . the tcs and rcs are related to the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath77 given in the expression  ( [ phiout ] ) . for both the input configurations ,",
    "sharp peaks are present only in small energy interval of the reflection and transmission spectra .",
    "it is worth noting that for different input states , such peaks appear at different values of @xmath0 .    to get a better insight into resonances",
    ", a zoom of the modulus of tc and rc for the various channels in the energy interval around the resonant condition @xmath155=15.8 mev is displayed in the right panels of the figure  [ fig2 ] . while for the input state @xmath151",
    "no resonance is present in this range and the sum of the moduli of tc and rc of the channel is equal to 1 , for @xmath150 the spectra show a number of sharp resonances ( see the top - right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in particular the probabilities of finding the dqd in the state @xmath95 ( with the scattered carrier , either reflected or transmitted ) shows a symmetric lorentzian peak around @xmath155 , while the tcs and rcs of the scattering channel @xmath93 exhibit a minimum .",
    "specifically , the rc presents a symmetric line - shape , and the tc an asymmetric one .",
    "this behavior clearly indicates that in the transmission and reflection spectra different kind of resonances appear , namely breit - wigner  @xcite and fano  @xcite , respectively which have a strong connection into into the building up of quantum correlations , as noted elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the first ones , exhibiting symmetric lorentzian peaks , stem from the coupling of a quasi bound state to the scattering states of the leads , while the second ones , characterized by asymmetric lineshapes , are present when two competing scattering mechanisms , a resonant one and a nonresonant one , interfere , and are due to electron - electron correlation  @xcite .",
    "scattering resonances are a signature of peculiar decohering and entangling effects  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the dependence of dqd decoherence @xmath120 and dot - dot entanglement @xmath129 are reported as a function of the initial energy of the incoming electron around @xmath155 for the input states @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "dot - dot entanglement @xmath129 and dqd decoherence @xmath120 against the initial kinetic energy @xmath0 of the incident electron around the resonance condition @xmath155 , for two different input states : @xmath159 ( solid line ) , @xmath160 ( dashed line ) , @xmath161 ( dash - dotted line ) , and @xmath162 ( dotted line ) . ]    for @xmath151 , the decoherence is practically zero while the entanglement remains 1 , as in the initial state .",
    "in fact , as can be gathered by the behavior of tc and rc , the only coefficients not vanishing in equation  ( [ phiout ] ) are @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and the output state @xmath165 of expression  ( [ 2threepart ] ) reduces to @xmath166 this is the factorizable product of a single - particle state of the scattered carrier and a two - qubit state describing the bound particles in the dqd , being the latter a bell state .",
    "this means that the entanglement between electrons confined in the dots maintains its maximum value and also that the quantum information about the dqd system is maximal since it is in a pure two - particle state .",
    "thus , the scattering event `` preserves '' the entanglement between the dots while the decoherence effects result to be negligible . such a behavior , evidencing the existence of decoherence - free entangled states of two qubits , has been widely discussed in a number of works , which stressed the key role played by the symmetric coupling of the qubits with the environment into preserving their coherence  @xcite    when the input state is @xmath156 , both decoherence @xmath120 and entanglement @xmath129 show a maximum where rc and tc of the channel @xmath95 are resonant ( see the top - right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) . in particular @xmath120 reaches @xmath167 .",
    "such a value is obtained when the dqd states are maximally coupled only to the energy levels @xmath0 and @xmath168 of the scattered carrier and this occurs when the probabilities that the scattering leaves the bound particles in their ground @xmath152 or excited @xmath95 state are equal .",
    "thus the output state can be written as @xmath169 where @xmath170=@xmath171 . in this case , from the expressions  ( [ enta1 ] ) and ( [ enta2 ] ) , we observe that the value of the peak of the dot - dot entanglement is equal to 1/2 , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . here an important point to be stressed is that quantum correlations are created between the bound electrons , even if their coulomb interaction is negligible due to the large distance between the dots .",
    "in fact , even if these can be thought as totally decoupled subsystems , the external environment , i.e. the scattered carrier , represents the interaction `` mediator '' and it represents the means to entangle them . in the literature , and on the basis of different physical mechanisms , the idea of an entanglement mediator has already been used in a number of theoretical and experimental models to produce bipartite entangled states  @xcite .",
    "the above results indicate that , for two electrons each bound in the ground state of one of the dots , the interaction with a single incident carrier having a suitable kinetic energy @xmath155 , excites the dots . specifically , the scattering channel corresponding to @xmath95 , namely the bell state describing the first dqd excited level , is activated and quantum correlations between the two dots appear , even if the bipartite entanglement production does not result to be maximal and immune to decohering effects . indeed ,",
    "the probability to excite the dqd is smaller than 1 .",
    "this implies that the two dots can not be described in terms of the state @xmath95 alone .",
    "rather , they are in a statistical mixture of ground and first - excited states . on the other hand",
    ", the scattering between a carrier having kinetic energy @xmath155 and the two electrons in the excited maximally - entangled state @xmath95 , leaves unchanged the dqd state , i.e. the entanglement is preserved and no decoherence effect appears .",
    "this behavior suggests that the maximum production of entanglement between dots set initially in their ground state , can be obtained as a consequence of the successive scatterings , one at a time , with carriers injected with energy around @xmath155 .",
    "in fact , at each scattering event the probability of finding the dqd system in the excited state @xmath172 becomes larger , and the amount of quantum correlations between the dots increases .",
    "such a sequence of carrier injections corresponds to an electric current where all the electrons entering in the device have the same energy @xmath155.from an experimental point of view , such a current can be produced , for example , by using single - electron sources such as , electron pumps  @xcite , resonant tunnelling diodes  @xcite , or systems consisting of a quantum dot connected to a conductor via a tunnel barrier  @xcite .",
    "all of these mechanisms , enable to emit uncorrelated electrons in a given quantum state with a specific energy .    in order to give a quantitative evaluation of the effect of an electric current on the dqd state , in [ appendix ]",
    "we have explicitely calculated the reduced density matrix @xmath173 describing the two dots after the injection of @xmath6 carriers .",
    "its expression in the standard basis @xmath137 is @xmath174 where @xmath175=@xmath170 , ranging from 0 to 1 , is the probability that a scattering event leaves the qds in the ground energy state when a carrier is injected with kinetic energy @xmath0 .",
    "as stated before , for @xmath0= @xmath155 , @xmath175 is around 1/2 .",
    "@xmath173 exhibits again an x structure and decoherence and entanglement of the system can be evaluated from the equations  ( [ deco ] ) and ( [ enta2 ] ) by setting @xmath176=@xmath177 , @xmath178=@xmath179=@xmath180 and @xmath181=@xmath182=@xmath183=0 .",
    "they reads @xmath184 respectively .",
    "when @xmath6=0 , i.e no scattering occurs , the expression  ( [ rhon ] ) reduces to @xmath185 , which describes the input state where the dqd is in @xmath186 . for @xmath6=1 ,",

    "that is , a current of independent electrons ( with energy @xmath155 ) entangles the two dots and does not create decoherence .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] displays the dependence of the entanglement upon the number @xmath6 of carriers entering in the device at different values of @xmath0 around the resonant energy @xmath155 .",

    "the inset displays the dependence of the dqd decoherence @xmath120 upon @xmath6 , for the same four values of @xmath0 . ]",
    "as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig4 ] , we find that a series of scatterings does not induce decoherence of the dqd first - excited state even for carriers injected with kinetic energies not exactly equal but close enough to @xmath155 .",
    "this implies that maximally - entangled states of the dqd are produced as an effect of the flux of the charge carriers even if the energy of the incident electrons is not precisely the resonant one .",
    "specifically , the farther @xmath0 is from @xmath155 , the larger @xmath6 is needed to produce a bell state decoupled from the environment .",
    "in fact , when the initial kinetic energy of the carriers gets away from the resonant one , the parameter @xmath175 , acting as a convergence factor , increases and the injection of more carriers in the device is needed to build up the maximum amount of quantum correlations between the dots . from the inset of figure  [ fig4 ] , we also note that the number @xmath6 of electrons needed to have a vanishing decoherence ( i.e. the dqd in a pure state ) is lower for @xmath0 closer to @xmath155 .",
    "in particular , @xmath120 shows a maximum , whose value is about @xmath167 when the interaction with the injected carriers reduces the state of the system to a statistical mixture with equal weights of the ground @xmath93 and the excited @xmath95 states .",

    "the top inset displays the modulus of the tc and rc of the channels @xmath93 and @xmath95 of the dqd as a function of @xmath0 around the resonant condition when the input state of the total system is @xmath151 : rc of channel @xmath93 ( solid line ) , tc of channel @xmath93 ( dashed line ) , rc of channel @xmath95 ( dotted line ) , tc of channel @xmath95 ( dot - dashed line ) .",

    "note that the abscissa scale is the same in the top and bottom insets . ]    for such a low kinetic energy , the scattering by a single carrier leaves unaltered the dqds system when the bound electrons are in the ground state @xmath93 .",
    "in fact @xmath0 is smaller than the energy necessary to excite the dots .",
    "this means that the the scattered carrier has not been coupled , via coulomb interaction , to the bound particles , which remain maximally disentangled ( see the bottom inset of the figure  [ fig5 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the input state of the total system is @xmath202 the dots can relax .",
    "in fact the scattering channels corresponding to @xmath203 show a peak in the transmission and reflection spectra ( as shown in the top inset of figure  [ fig5 ] ) thus leading to the appearance of decoherence and entanglement .    by applying the approach adopted above for building up maximum entanglement between the bound electrons",
    ", we find that the scattering by a current of charge carriers with energy around @xmath204 mev is able to disentangle completely the quantum dots without introducing any decoherence .",
    "specifically , after a larger number @xmath6 of scattered carriers , the bound electrons practically occupy the ground state of the dqd system : this means @xmath205 and @xmath206 , as reported in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the coherent manipulation of electron states is the key ingredient for implementing qubits using charge or orbital states of dqd nanostructures .",
    "indeed , it implies the controlled production or destruction , the manipulation and detection of entanglement between the above states . in this spirit",
    ", various proposals to produce bipartite entangled state have been advanced on the basis of the physical mechanisms requiring two - particle scattering , such as the direct interaction between two electrons  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have investigated the appearance of quantum correlations between the two electrons of a gaas dqd , as a consequence of the coulomb scattering by one or more charge carriers injected from a lead .",
    "we examined the scattering event in a three - particle regime ( the two electrons trapped in the dqds and the passing carrier , explicitely considered indistinguishable ) , that is , a carrier is supposed to enter in the scattering region only after the previous one has already left .",
    "furthermore , the two dots are taken distant enough so that the coulomb repulsion between the two bound electrons is practically negligible",
    ". therefore , unlike other approaches  @xcite , the scattered carrier represents the entanglement `` mediator '' , that is , it provides the indirect interaction between the particles needed to entangle them . from this point of view , various scheme where entanglement between distant particles is produced though their scattering by mobile mediators are present in literature  @xcite . unlike our model , there",
    "the quantum correlations are built among the spin degrees of the freedom of the particles .",
    "a proper tuning of the carrier energy and the dqd geometry reduces the system here examined to a simple two - qubit model coupled to the external degrees of freedom by the incident electrons . here",
    ", the dots have not been considered as point - like systems  @xcite but their effective spatial dimensions are explicitely taken into account in the calculation .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of the electron spatial wavefunctions corresponding to eigenstates of the dqd is needed to obtain the few - particle scattering states .",
    "to this aim , a time - independent approach based on the qtbm has been used  @xcite .",
    "its solution gives the reflection and transmission amplitude of each scattering channel as a function of the initial energy of the incoming electron .",
    "such an approach permits to analyze the relation between the resonances in the transmission and reflection spectra and the appearance of quantum correlations between the particles , as already pointed out elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "all the travelling components of the scattered carrier , both reflected and transmitted , have been used to evaluate the creation of the entanglement between the dots , together with their decoherence .",
    "our numerical simulations show that as a consequence of the scattering between an electron injected with a suitable energy and two electrons bound in the ground state of the dqd system , the latter can be excited , ending up in an entangled state of the constituent dots .",
    "this process leads to the appearance of resonance peaks and dips in transmission and reflection spectra of the first - excited and ground scattering channels , respectively .",
    "a side - effect of such a scattering is the loss of quantum coherence of the dqd as whole due to its coupling to the scattered carrier .",
    "the condition of maximum entanglement between the two dots is reached when the bound electrons are fully raised to the two - particle first - excited level of the dqd system ( which corresponds to a bell - state formed with the single - particle ground and first - excited states of the two dots ) . in this case , the dqd decoherence is zero , since a single output channel is possible .",
    "however , a single collision is not able to fully excite the dots .",
    "we found that , in order to build up the maximum amount of quantum correlation between them , a repeated injection of charge carriers , that is an electric current , is needed .",
    "indeed , at each scattering event the excitation probability of the dots increases until it reaches asymptotically 1 , which means that a bell state is obtained , fully decoupled from the degrees of freedom of the scattered carriers .",
    "in other words , the coulomb interaction between an electric current and two electrons bound in the ground state of a dqd structure allows for the maximum entanglement production while the decoherence effects on the system vanish .",
    "this is in agreement with the procedures adopted in other works  @xcite , where the entangling schemes are based on the successive interactions of a mediator with the qubits .",
    "however , in our scheme , the indirect coupling of the two dots due to interaction with the scattered carriers , can produce disentangling effects , as well .",
    "indeed , a proper tuning of the electric current makes the dqd , initially in a bell state to relax into the ground state , with no quantum correlations .",
    "also in this case the process results to be robust against decoherence .    finally , the results here reported show how a suitable electron current , where all the carriers have almost a given kinetic energy , permits to switch coherently on and off the entanglement between the dots of a dqd structure .",
    "although several interaction mechanisms , as electron - phonon coupling can lead to the loss of quantum coherence of the dqd in a real experimental setup , we showed that interaction with the mediator electrons does not generate entanglement with the leads .",
    "thus , no intrinsic decoherence is implied .",
    "here we shall give the explicit derivation of the reduced density matrix of the two dots ( see equation ( [ rhon ] ) ) , initially taken in their ground state , once @xmath6 carriers injected with kinetic energy @xmath207 close to @xmath208 have been scattered . in order to simplify the calculation , the basis @xmath209 of the dqd eigenstates will be used .",
    "once obtained the reduced density operator @xmath210 in the @xmath211 basis , its expression @xmath212 in terms of the @xmath137 is straightforward ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .    the output three - particle state of equation  ( [ state2 ] ) , stemming from the scattering between one carrier injected in the device with @xmath207=@xmath208 and the two electrons in the ground state of the dqd , can be written as @xmath213 where the superscript ( 1 ) means 1 carrier injected , and the reduced density matrix of the dqd system can be obtained by tracing @xmath214 over the degrees of freedom @xmath215 of the scattered carrier @xmath216 when a second carrier is injected , after the exit of the previous one from the scattering region , the new output state is @xmath217 as stressed in section  [ results ] , when the dqd is in @xmath218 , the scattering event does not produce the relaxation of the dots which remain in the excited energy level .",
    "this means that in the above expression @xmath219 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the dqd computed from the three - particle state of equation  ( [ psi2 ] ) is @xmath220 where @xmath175=@xmath170=@xmath221 have been used . for the case of @xmath6 scattered particles we get @xmath222 as derived by induction in the following .",
    "assume that expression ( [ casen ] ) is true for @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that @xmath223 . after the injection of the @xmath224-th carrier ,",
