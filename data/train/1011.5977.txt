    "some of the signatures found in the more evolved magnetic stars like @xmath2cep and @xmath11cas may be explained by evolution models accounting for a magnetic dynamo .",
    "however , these models do not predict the magnetic field to reach the stellar surface .",
    "the magnetic fields are probably of fossil origin instead .",
    "it is likely that the enhanced transport efficiency ( when compared to models accounting for rotation only ) is retained in that case , as the basic physics behind is not sensitive to the origin of the magnetic field .",
    "however , this has to be confirmed by detailed modelling .    other objects , in particular @xmath12sco , challenge present stellar models seriously .",
    "the observed mixing signature of @xmath12sco may be explained by homogeneous evolution , but this has also to be confirmed by further computations .",
    "homogeneous evolution would require a highly - efficient spin - down mechanism , as the star is a truely slow rotator at present ( * ? ? ? * ( donati et al .",
    "2006 ) ) , like several other magnetic stars with pronounced mixing signature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( morel et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "one may speculate on magnetic breaking due to angular - momentum losses by a magnetically confined line - driven stellar wind or magnetic coupling to the accretion disc during the star - forming process in the case of a fossil field . even though the topic is not understood theoretically in a comprehensive way , spin - down times of the order of 1myr (",

    "based on their mixing signatures we therefore suggest the following objects for follow - up spectropolarimetric observations : @xmath17tau as a high - potential target and @xmath22orib , @xmath23ori , pt pup and @xmath24eri ( * ? ? ? *",

    "case a mass - transfer in close binary systems ",
    "i.e. near the end of the core h - burning phase of the primary  is one of the most promising mechanisms .",
    "this can produce stars highly enriched in cno - cycled products close to the zams .",
    "such stars would be fast rotators because of angular momentum transfer accompanying the mass overflow .",
    "the observational identification of such systems may be challenging , though , as the companion of the visible ob star is likely a low - mass helium star in a wide orbit , see @xcite for details .",
    "+ finally , we want to comment briefly on the question whether the occurrence of pulsations is in any way related to cno mixing .",
    "the pulsations of @xmath2cep stars and spbs are excited via the @xmath25-mechanism because of a subsurface opacity bump due to the ionization of iron - group elements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( pamyatnykh 1999 ) ) . yet",
    ", an additional factor is required to explain the occurrence of pulsators and non - pulastors in the same regions of the hrd .",
    "additional changes in the opacities due to modified cno abundances as a consequence of mixing with nuclear - processed matter may be a possibility .",
    "however , our results do not support this hypothesis , pulsations occur independently of mixing signatures , see fig .",
    "theory predicts surface abundances of massive stars to follow a tight relation when mixing with cno - cycled material occurs . the nuclear path in the n / o - n / c plane",
    "is solely determined by the initial cno abundances .",
    "this provides a powerful criterion for judging the quality of quantitative analyses .",
    "few early - type massive stars can be expected to deviate from this nuclear path , either due to atomic diffusion ( which is normally not operational in ob - type stars ) or because of pollution with material from advanced nuclear burning phases , e.g. accreted in the course of a binary supernova ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( przybilla et al . 2008a ; irrgang et al . 2010 ) ) . only observational data passing this test",
    "is well - suited for being used in the verification of different stellar evolution models .",
    "the high - quality analysis of our sample stars indicates that most objects can be explained well by existing models for rotating stars .",
    "it also facilitates the identification of a connection of pronounced mixing signatures with the presence of magnetic fields  initially suggested by @xcite  at high confidence . in reverse ,",
    "pronounced mixing signatures may be used to define high - potential targets for spectropolarimetric surveys that aim at the detection of magnetic stars .",

    "further studies , observational as well as theoretical , are required to develop a comprehensive understanding of chemical mixing in massive stars .",
    "high - quality analyses have to be extended to larger samples of stars , covering a wide range of rotational velocities .",
    "further contraints to stellar evolution models can be obtained by inclusion of stars at different metallicity , like e.g. objects in the magellanic clouds .",
    "once the ongoing surveys as the mimes project ( wade et al . , these proceedings ) will detect more magnetic stars it will become feasible to develop a better overview on the rle that magnetic dynamos and/or fossil fields play in the course of the evolution of massive stars .",
