    "the resonant transneptunian objects ( tnos ) are a set of edgeworth - kuiper belt objects whose orbital elements are such that the perturbations of neptune causes relatively large - amplitude ( @xmath71% ) oscillations of the orbit on only 10@xmath8-year time scales ( much faster than secular oscillations in the outer solar system ) .",
    "a necessary , but not sufficient condition for a object to be in a mean - motion resonance is that its semimajor axis @xmath9 implies an orbital period @xmath10 which is a low - order integer ratio with neptune with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two small integers , in which case the object is said to be in the @xmath14 resonance with neptune , whose period is @xmath15 and semimajor axis @xmath16 .",

    "pluto was the first known resonant tno ; its presence in the 3:2 resonance at @xmath1839.5  au was discovered via direct numerical integration @xcite .",
    "an important property of these resonances is that even resonant tnos with eccentricities @xmath19 so high that their perihelia @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 , and thus approach the sun more closely than neptune , are ` phase protected ' by the resonance due to neptune never being nearby when the tno is at pericenter ; in the case of pluto , this phase protection means the planet actually gets closer to uranus than neptune ( although pluto s orbit is especially rich in resonant behaviors ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in less than",
    "a year after the first moderately - sized tnos began to be discovered in the 1990 s , other tnos in the 3:2 resonance were recognized @xcite . termed ` plutinos ' @xcite , these objects remain the most numerous of the known resonant objects , with @xcite reviewing the historical recognition of tnos in other resonances .",
    "the most recent compilations of accurately - measured resonant orbits @xcite lists objects from the 1:1 ( trojan ) resonance all the way out to the 27:4 for 2004 pb@xmath22 = i4212 as the current record holder for largest resonant tno semimajor axis , at @xmath23 au .",
    "it is likely that even larger-@xmath9 resonant tnos exist , but because the high - order resonances are thin in phase space , extremely - accurate orbits are required before the resonant behaviour can be confirmed .",
    "a powerful idea is that the resonant tnos were captured during an outward migration of neptune in the distant past , although there exist several contexts .",
    "@xcite proposed pluto s eccentricity had its origin due to capture into the 3:2 as the resonance swept over the initial heliocentric orbit of pluto during neptune s outward migration ; after capture , neptune s continued migration forced up the captured tno s @xmath19 due to conservation of angular momentum .",
    "@xcite explored the sweep - up of resonant objects into a variety of resonances , showing how models match the observed - tno distribution better if the resonances migrated into a primordial belt that has already been dynamically heated rather than the @xmath24 case of a dynamically - cold planetesimal disk , although achieving an inclination @xmath25 distribution as hot as the observed objects was difficult .",
    "@xcite showed that abundant large-@xmath25 plutinos could be produced if the plutinos were trapped out of a scattering disk already having interacted with neptune , rather than from a pre - existing cold belt .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite simulated resonant capture , looking at the population of resonances after the migration phase , including studying how the relative populations of resonant ` modes ' in the 2:1 resonance varied as a function of neptune s migration distance and rate .",
    "all these studies identified the problem that even though these models pump eccentricities via the capture process , they still favoured migration into a dynamically pre - heated disk and even then the inclination distribution of the trapped resonant objects is not sufficiently high .",
    "more recently , @xcite explored the idea that the _ entire kuiper belt _ was ` planted ' in its current location as particles scattering off of neptune during the late stages of planet formation are dropped to lower eccentricity while temporarily trapped in mean - motion resonance , and are then decoupled into the current kuiper belt ; in this model the resonant particles are simply those that remained in the resonances at the end of migration .",
    "this model has several desirable properties , although the production of a kuiper belt with the correct inclination distribution is a challenge @xcite . in our present manuscript , we will compare our measurements of how various resonances are populated with some published models .      ,",

    "many tnos are currently known to be in mean - motion resonances with neptune , meaning that the tno s orbit is coupled to that of neptune .",
    "neptune s mean longitude @xmath30 ( roughly its location around its orbit as measured from the j2000 ecliptic reference axis ) is related to the tno s longitude @xmath31 ( its current position ) and the longitude @xmath32 of where the tno s perihelion location is located .",
    "operationally , inhabiting the @xmath14 resonance can be diagnosed by confirming ( in a numerical integration ) that the resonant angle @xmath33 does not explore all values from 0 to 360@xmath29 . the most common case ( but not only possibility ) for real resonant tnos",
    "is that @xmath34 oscillates ( librates ) around a mean @xmath35 with some amplitude @xmath36 ( termed the libration amplitude ) .",
    "for example , a tno in the 7:4 resonance with libration amplitude @xmath37 means that @xmath38 oscillates ( roughly sinusoidally ) between 170 and 190@xmath29 ; such small amplitudes are rare in reality . because @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the tno s mean anomaly , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phijk ] ) forces that when the tno is at perihelion ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 in our example of the 7:4 resonance , this means that the tno s pericenter is ` leading ' ( @xmath43 ) neptune by ( 180/4)=45@xmath29 for @xmath44 ; as @xmath38 oscillates by @xmath45 , the perihelion longitude oscillates by ( 10@xmath29/4)=2.5@xmath29 relative to the 45@xmath29 offset ( see the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pretty ] ) . because @xmath38 = 540@xmath29 , 900@xmath29 , and 1260@xmath29 ( adding multiples of 360@xmath29 to 180@xmath29 ) are all also valid , this results in perihelion longitudes for libration center to be 45@xmath29 , 135@xmath29 , 225@xmath29 , and 315@xmath29 ahead of neptune for @xmath46 tnos ; essentially one can add @xmath47 for any integer @xmath48 to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : longdiff ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to ` trace the orbit ' of a single low - libration amplitude tno in the co - rotating panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : pretty ] ; any single particle for the @xmath14 resonance explores all @xmath13 perihelion concentrations after making @xmath13 orbits around the sun . during that time",
    "neptune will have made @xmath12 heliocentric orbits .",
    "the two rightmost panels of fig .  [ fig : pretty ] illustrate the different generic case of the @xmath49:1 resonances , which can librate in more that one state of perihelion locking relative to neptune ( these are usually called different ` islands ' ) despite the fact that @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : longdiff ] ) .",
    "although these resonances still have ` symmetric ' libration of the resonant argument @xmath51 around an average value of @xmath52 , usually with very large amplitude , they can also exhibit ` asymmetric libration ' around another @xmath53 which depends on the value of the orbital eccentricity @xcite . because these are @xmath54 resonances , the perihelion location of a given such particle is confined to one of the two sky longitudes ( hence the term asymmetric ) ; if the reader traces an asymmetric 3:1 orbit in fig .",
    "[ fig : pretty ] they will see that it does _ not _ visit both perihelion clusters .",
    "the existence of confined pericenter locations for resonant tnos has important implications for their observational study ; surveys are most sensitive to resonant tnos that can be at perihelion in the patch of sky being examined . because the number of tnos increases rapidly as one goes to fainter magnitudes ( due to the size distribution being steep ) and because most resonant tnos occupy eccentric orbits ( @xmath55 or much larger ) , the number of detectable tnos above the limit of a flux - limited survey is a strong function of longitude relative to neptune .",
    "essentially one becomes dominated by the hordes of smaller tnos present near perihelion that become the majority of a detected sample .",
    "although this is a generic effect of eccentric populations @xcite it is more severe for the resonant populations than the main classical belt due to the usually lower eccentricities of the latter ; we will illustrate this effect below with the plutino population . the longitude bias in @xmath32 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pretty ] s toy models are more extreme than reality because the libration amplitude distribution of the resonances is not concentrated towards zero .",
    "this introduces yet another effect : during the oscillation of the resonant argument more time passes with @xmath34 near the extremes @xmath56 than at the libration center @xmath57 itself .",
    "as an example , using the 5:3 resonance ( fig .  [ fig : pretty ] ) , if one were looking 85@xmath29 ahead of neptune , then the 5:3 resonators ( from the nearby ` average ' @xmath58 perihelion cluster ) with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 times larger than the 25@xmath29 longitude difference , _ cf .",
    ", _ eq .  [ eq : longdiff ] ) will be favoured over other 5:3 resonators , if all other parameters are equal .",
    "a similar detection bias is caused by orbital inclination @xmath25 ; as a tno rises and falls in ecliptic latitude it will spend less time at latitudes near the ecliptic than at latitudes close to @xmath61 .",
    "this results in the true intrinsic tno sky density of a given inclination peaking just below the latitude corresponding to the inclination , and the ecliptic being the least likely place to find any given high-@xmath25 tno .",
    "the real population in any given resonance is a superposition of all eccentricities , libration centers , and libration amplitudes .",
    "conclusions about the distribution of any of these parameters can not be quantitative without detailed understanding of the longitude coverage and depth of the surveys in which they were found .",
    "the data acquisition of the cfeps survey is described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the survey coverage was divided into ` blocks ' of contiguous sky around the ecliptic , labelled l3f through l7a , where the number indicates the calendar year of the block s `` discovery '' observations ( 2003 through 2007 ) and the letter is the common mpc format designation of the two - week chunk to the calendar year ( thus , discovery observations of l5c were performed in the first half of february 2005 ) .",
    "objects discovered in the block are given internal designations like l5c11 , indicating the eleventh tno discovered in the l5c block .",
    "this paper models the resonant cfeps tnos that are characterized detections40% in their cfeps discovery block , as defined in @xcite . ] from the 3:2 ( plutinos ) and 5:2 resonances , three @xmath49:3 resonances ( the 4:3 , 5:3 , and 7:3 ) , the 5:4 and 7:4 resonance , and three @xmath49:1 resonances ( the 2:1 , 3:1 , and 5:1 ) .",
    "the orbital elements for the cfeps tnos in these resonances are given in tables  [ tab : elems ] and [ tab : elems2 ] .",
    "in addition we give a 95%-confidence upper limit on the neptune trojan population from our non - detection of such an object .",
    "other resonances had zero or one cfeps tnos in them , and we elected to not generate upper limits on their populations .",
    "the discovery and tracking of these objects is discussed in @xcite .",
    "important for our purposes here is : ( 1 ) a wide range of ecliptic longitudes were surveyed with cfeps , which means cfeps was sensitive to objects with a large variety of libration amplitudes , ( 2 ) patches of sky away from the perihelion longitudes of the resonances were quantitatively characterized ; the _ non - detection _ of resonant objects at those longitudes provides powerful constraints on the large - amplitude resonators , and ( 3 ) an extremely high fraction of the discoveries were tracked , preventing loss of unusual objects , as described in @xcite . as an example of this , cfeps re - discovered tnos actually inhabiting the rare 5:4 and 7:3 mean - motion resonances ( l3y11 , l3y07 and l5c19pd ; see table  [ tab : elems2 ] caption ) at on - sky positions @xmath62 from the ephemeris that had been assigned based on an incorrect orbit computed from the short - arc discovery prior to 2003 ( _ i.e. , _ the tnos had been lost before their resonant nature was recognized ) .",
    "tables  [ tab : res ] and [ tab : res2 ] list the current barycentric @xmath63 j2000 osculating elements of each object and a determination of the resonant libration amplitude , which comes from the range of possible orbits as diagnosed in the method of @xcite .",
    "the resonance amplitudes listed should be interpreted as a range which encompasses nearly all ( @xmath6499% ) of the possible true values of the tno s libration amplitude . because the cfeps tracking strategy regularly provided off - opposition observations during the 3-opposition orbits , the libration amplitudes for the cfeps sample are more precise than for the majority of the mpc sample given in @xcite and @xcite because many of the objects in the mpc database have much sparser astrometric coverage .",
    "in addition to mean - motion libration amplitudes , the kozai resonance ( see appendix ) is observed to function for two cfeps plutinos ( l4h07 and l4k01 ) ; table  [ tab : elems ] gives the amplitude and mean value of the argument of pericenter @xmath65 ( which is effectively the resonant angle ) . for objects in @xmath49:1 resonances where there are symmetric and asymmetric libration islands ,",
    "table  [ tab : elems2 ] identifies the mode and estimates of the libration center position and libration amplitude .",

    "candidate orbital distributions were tested as described in @xcite and the best - matching models were determined ; briefly , models for which one of the @xmath70 or @xmath71 cumulative distributions have an anderson - darling statistic which occurs by random @xmath725% of the time are rejected .",

    "these parametric representations are entirely empirical , due to the fact that there is no physical model that provides a parametric form . however , because these functional forms provide rather satisfactory matches to the cfeps detections , theoretical models of resonant tno production will have to provide orbital parameter distributions that give roughly the same distribution as our intrinsic model , rather than values in the biased mpc sample .",
    "for example , we find the plutino eccentricity distribution is strongly peaked near @xmath73=0.18 with narrow width ; this intrinsic @xmath75 peak is below the median plutino @xmath19 of 0.22 in the minor planet center .",

    "since plutinos are often discovered at nearby 3035  au distances , their faster rate of motion makes accurate determination of their orbits more critical than classical objects , and they are easier to lose at the next opposition .",
    "our plutino inclination distribution is quite similar to the inclination distribution of the ` hot ' component of the classical kuiper belt , making it plausible that the plutinos and the hot classical belt are both captured populations whose inclination distribution neither affected their capture probability , nor was @xmath25 critical for post - capture erosion over the solar system s age .",

    "the argument of pericenter for a kozai plutino librates around @xmath65=90 or 270@xmath29 due to the fact that the resonance affects the angular precession rate , so although @xcite show that the kozai effect in the non - resonant kuiper belt appears only at large @xmath19 and @xmath25 , inside the 3:2 resonance the kozai resonance can appear for even moderate - inclination plutinos @xcite .",
    "the libration amplitude @xmath93 depends on the initial @xmath19 , @xmath25 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the plutinos l4h07 and l4k01 both librate with a period of @xmath745  myr , both are in the @xmath94 kozai island island ; the mpc sample has roughly equal numbers in each island .",

    "looking at the full set of kozai plutinos in the @xcite compilation , we found that using a set of kozai trajectories corresponding to the @xmath98 kozai hamiltonian with different initial @xmath99 values provided a range of kozai librations sufficient to model the current sample .    having this kozai dynamics model",

    "@xcite point out that because the kozai plutinos are somewhat more stable than the average plutino , the kozai fraction should have slowly grown with time . dynamical simulations which attempt to create the plutino orbital structure must thus ` erode ' their populations to the modern epoch and then state distributions of libration amplitude for both the 3:2 resonant argument and the kozai libration amplitude , which may be matched to future de - biased surveys .",

    "this is important because , as @xcite showed , the distribution of plutino detection distances is a sensitive function of the combination of the @xmath102 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 parameters ( where the latter two are the center and width of a gaussian @xmath19 distribution ) .",
    "detection biases favor finding larger-@xmath19 plutinos at small distances .",

    ", surveys really only measure the slope of the size distribution which correspond to the @xmath0-magnitude range for the population in question near perihelion ; for cfeps plutinos this means that we constrain the value of @xmath102 for the range @xmath3=89 ; smaller plutinos are undetectable and larger ones are too rare to be statistically constrained .",

    "the cfeps sample provides 5 characterized twotinos ( table  [ tab : elems2 ] ) .",
    "another twotino detected in the survey , u7a08 @xcite , is associated with the symmetric island but u7a08 is excluded from this resonant study because its faintness puts it below the 40% detection efficiency threshold which cfeps felt it could reliably debias ( `` u '' means un - characterized ) .",
    "unfortunately this is the largest - inclination twotino ( @xmath187 ) in our sample .",
    "we elected to use a gaussian inclination width of 9@xmath29 , which allows the cfeps survey simulator to provide a large fraction of @xmath188 detections , while simultaneously allowing the existence of larger-@xmath25 twotinos known in the mpc sample is 130391 = 2008 jg@xmath189 , with @xmath190 , which appears to be a symmetric librator ] .",
    "we find that the inclination distribution of the twotinos _ must _ ( at @xmath6495% confidence ) be colder than for the 3:2 and 5:2 resonances .",
    "the lack of large-@xmath25 2:1 librators in cfeps is not statistically alarming , especially when one considers that one does not expect the inclination distribution today to be gaussian : @xcite and @xcite show that long - term dynamical stability of the 2:1 is inclination dependent , with inclinations above 15@xmath29 being more unstable , especially for symmetric librators .",
    "thus the colder inclination width does not necessarily provide cosmogonic information .",
    "we have verified that changing the inclination width by a factor of two generates only a factor of two variation in the population estimate ,    three of the four characterized asymmetric cfeps twotinos occupy the island with @xmath191 ( sometimes called the ` trailing ' island because the perihelion longitudes are ` behind ' neptune s ecliptic longitude ) while the fourth occupies the leading asymmetric island .",
    "we thus have an apparent ( biased ) measure of the ` leading fraction ' @xmath192 of 0.25 .",
    "this is an interesting contrast to @xcite who reported that all of the twotinos from the des at that time inhabited the leading asymmetric island , and @xcite discuss the apparent leading / trailing ratio of 7/2 at that time , or @xmath192 = 7/9 = 0.78 .",
    "it is clear that our trailing preponderance is due to the depth of the cfeps l4j , l4k , l5i , and l5j blocks @xcite which are well placed to find trailing twotinos , while the cfeps coverage of the longitude where leading asymmetric twotinos come to perihelion is sparse ( the ls3s block was not especially deep ) .",
    "we used the cfeps survey simulator to show that on average one - third of asymmetric twotinos detected by cfeps would be in the leading island ( @xmath193 ) due to our block depth and placement relative to galactic plane , even if the true population was equally distributed ( @xmath194=0.5 ) between the two islands .",
    "we hypothesize that the des survey simply had had the opposite selection effect .",
    "@xcite suggested calibrating the observational selection effects by using the 3:2 ratio , but the galactic plane confusion is not the same for the two resonances ; due to neptune s position , ` trailing ' plutinos are not as confused by the galactic plane as trailing asymmetric twotinos .",
    "therefore precise measurement of a population asymmetry demands an absolutely - calibrated survey with well - understood detection efficiency differences for the two relevant portions of sky . to illustrate what limits can be set on the true value of @xmath194 using the cfeps calibration , we asked the question : how large would @xmath194 have to be before 95% of the time cfeps would find 2 or more leading detections ( and thus rule out this value of @xmath194 ) ? the cfeps calibration demands @xmath195 at 95% confidence . for a lower bound ,",
    "@xmath196 is required ( 95% confidence ) to allow the existence of at least one leading twotino detection in cfeps .",
    "the 67% confidence range is @xmath197 but we prefer to use the 95% range of @xmath194=0.030.85 for the fraction of all asymmetric twotinos in the leading island .",
    "the @xmath1980.03 limit only requires that the trailing / leading ratio be less than 30 , to be compared with ratios up to @xmath130 found by @xcite in simulations of asymmetric capture during neptune migration .",
    "this weak observational constraint does not yet provide interesting rejection of cosmogonic theories , but a factor of several more twotinos in well - calibrated surveys has the potential to do so .",
    "the symmetric librator k02o12=2002 pu@xmath199 has libration amplitude @xmath200 ; over a full libration cycle its perihelion longitude can thus be found anywhere on the sky not within @xmath201 of neptune .",
    "the excluded cfeps discovery u7a08 ( not characterized due to its faintness ) is an alternating ` three - timing ' 2:1 object , meaning that during numerical evolution forward in time , its resonant argument switches between symmetric and asymmetric modes .",
    "this commonly - seen behaviour @xcite does not invalidate a parametrization of the 2:1 as having a ` symmetric fraction ' @xmath186 because it is reasonable to assume that this fraction is maintained in steady state .    with",
    "only five characterized 2:1 cfeps detections , our orbital distribution is based on abundant theoretical understanding of the resonance s dynamics , rather than an empirical model fit to our detections ( which will have too many parameters to be constrained by our 5 detections ) . instead",
    ", the range of libration centers , amplitudes and eccentricities ( and correlations between them ) are provided from analytic understanding and numerical explorations of the resonance ( see appendix ) .",
    "this model provides a non - rejectable match , leaving as the only remaining adjustable parameter the unknown fraction @xmath202 that the symmetric librators make up of the twotino population .",
    "the symmetric libration fraction is poorly measured .",
    "a few such objects are known @xcite , but again because the selection effects are very different for symmetric versus asymmetric librators only a survey with well - characterized sky coverage can provide an estimate . with",
    "only 1 in 5 characterized detection in cfeps being symmetric , we can only weakly constrain @xmath202 . because the fraction of detected twotinos which are symmetric will depend on a survey s longitude coverage",
    ", we can only determine it for our own survey ; we did this by running a large suite of models to determine the detected fraction of symmetric detections as function of the intrinsic value and find that our 20% apparent fraction implies @xmath203 , which we adopt .",
    "the remaining 70% of the twotinos are equally divided among the two asymmetric islands .",
    "luckily our population estimate is only a weak function of @xmath202 ; we determined that even if @xmath202 were increased to 0.75 the total twotino population estimate rises only 25% ( again , this result will not be identical for a survey with different sky coverage ) .",
    "we find a plutino / twotino ratio to be @xmath734 , similar to the ratio estimated by @xcite .",
    "an important new result from cfeps is the fact that the twotinos are less numerous than 5:2 librators , which will be discussed in sec .",

    "population comparisons benefit from uncertainty estimates . in particular , the population ratios in the well - studied 3:2 , 2:1 , and 5:2 are desirable . to obtain a set of absolute population estimates , we drew particles at random from our model orbital and @xmath0-magnitude distributions until obtaining the true number of cfeps detections for a given resonance ( fig .",

    "this is thus an important new constraint on formation models .",
    "this kind of constant also holds for more distant resonances .",
    "both the 3:1 and 5:1 have best - estimate populations larger than the 2:1 ( although uncertainties are large ) , indicating that large-@xmath9 resonant orbits must be efficiently populated by formation models . in models like @xcite , where the kuiper belt is transplanted out ,",

    "the hypothesis that these objects are instead swept into @xmath243  au resonances from warm or hot populations located at these distances before planet migration is faced with the problem of explaining where all the non - resonant tnos have gone .",

    "due to their chaotic boundaries , the resonances provide a ` leakier ' source of scattering tnos than the classical belt and most tnos escaping a resonance would immediately find themselves on neptune - coupled orbits and begin scattering .",
    "in such a scenario the escape rate from all resonances would balance the loss of actively scattering objects to the centaur population or ejection from the solar system .",
    "the flaw in this scenario is that there seem to be too many scattering tnos in the current epoch to permit them being anything other than the decaying remnant of a huge primordial population @xcite .",

    "this analysis should be re - done however because volk and malhotra assumed that essentially all of today s ` excited ' tnos ( observed by various surveys ) are scattered objects contributing to the centaur supply chain , while in fact the @xmath243  au population has a very non - negligible resonant component @xcite , and @xcite and this current manuscript show that the actively scattering population is only a tiny fraction of the other ` excited ' ( resonant + hot classical + detached ) populations .",
    "the total resonant population is , however , also comparable to the @xcite estimate for the sum of the outer classical and detached populations ( of @xmath780,000 with @xmath5 ) .",
    "this permits serious consideration of the hypothesis that most detached tno population are resonant objects that were dropped out of resonance while the resonant objects were being emplaced , but must generate roughly equal numbers of resonant and non - resonant objects surviving to the present day .",
    "given the available constraints from the structure and relative populations of various kuiper belt components , what can one conclude about the processes that emplaced these components ? based on our debiased understanding from cfeps , we feel that the following constraints are of chief importance :    \\1 . the resonant populations appear to be consistent with all being emplaced from a source population that lacked a cold component .",
    "( the differences between them can be plausibly explained by capture or subsequent erosion processes that are inclination - dependent . )",
    "the inner classical belt and outer classical belt lack a cold inclination component @xcite , with only the main belt having both hot and cold components .",
    "the sum of the resonant populations is @xmath24875% that of the main belt , for @xmath127 .",
    "the current ` actively scattering ' disk is @xmath75% of the main belt population , with at least factor of two uncertainty .",
    "although we do not support it here with detailed simulations , we believe that the following scenario could explain the known structure .",
    "a crucial feature is that the cold population is confined to the @xmath9=42 - 47  au region of the main belt , with a hotter @xmath19 distribution for @xmath249  au .",
    "we postulate the cold population could be primordial , with an initial outer edge at this 44.4  au boundary .",
    "the plausible scenario consists of all the other kuiper belt populations ( hot classical , including the inner and outer belts , detached objects , resonant objects , and the currently scattering objects ) being planted into the belt via a mechanism similar to that described by @xcite and @xcite , in which a massive scattering disk is flung out by the migrating giant planets ; resonant trapping of the scattering objects and subsequent dropout litters the hot classical population behind the slowly - advancing resonances ( which are wide and powerful due to neptune s temporarily larger @xmath250 ) .",
    "neptune ` jumps ' out several au due to encounters with uranus and both planets decouple due to damping of their eccentricities . today",
    "s resonant objects are those which were still trapped during the final stages of this process as @xmath251 . unlike the @xcite model , we posit : ( 1 ) the scattering disk extends to very large @xmath9 already when neptune ` jumped ' out to nearly 30  au .",
    "( 2 ) this scattering disk was very hot ; essentially the @xmath252 width which all the non - cold populations share .",
    "how this happens is unknown .",
    "( 3 ) the cold population is already in place ; it is largely unaffected because the 2:1 resonance jumps to or beyond the 44.4 au edge .",
    "eccentric neptune is able to dimly ` stir ' the @xmath253 distribution of the cold disk , keeping most stirred perihelia @xmath254  au , before @xmath250 rapidly decays .",
    "a critical constraint is to prevent tnos from the cold population appearing in either the 3:2 or 2:1 resonance ; this requires that after jumping to near @xmath9=30  au , any remaining small outward neptune migration can not allow the resonances to sweep through a cold population , because it would readily trap and preserve them @xcite . keeping the 2:1 free of low-@xmath25 tnos can be accomplished by having the post - jump value of the resonant semimajor axis beyond the outer edge of the cold disk ( say , landing in the 4546  au range before finishing outward migration by another  au or so ) .",
    "the situation with the 3:2 is more complex because its lack of a cold component seemingly implies that by the time neptune jumped , the semimajor axis range between the post - jump @xmath255 au and today s value must have already been empty of cold objects .",
    "although a primordial inner edge of the cold population is not impossible , the fact that the current @xmath256  au inner boundary of the cold population is at the border of the @xmath161 secular resonance allows a scenario in which this strongly - unstable secular resonance swept through the @xmath737 - 39  au region prior to any final small - distance neptune migration ; @xcite show that the @xmath161 drives particles to neptune encounters in only @xmath257  myr , which is comparable to the migration time scale for neptune in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the primordial cold objects with @xmath258  au join the scattering tnos , but make up only a tiny fraction of this population as they are ` diluted ' if any of them are later re - planted into the kuiper belt .",
    "unfortunately , the timing ( and even migration direction ) of the @xmath161 is unclear ; @xcite show early and rapid migration of the @xmath161 inwards as the the protoplanet disk s mass eroded , but their calculations did not include the probable outward migration of neptune",
    ".    in our scenario one has an easy explanation for the differences in colours , size distribution , and binary fraction of the cold main - belt fraction ; the cold belt was simply steeper , redder , and either formed more binaries or preserved a greater fraction of them , unlike the implanted components @xcite .",
    "although there is no direct observational timing constraint , this implantation scenario seems more natural if the disk is scattered very early in the solar system s history , without the @xmath7600  myr delay proposed in the nice model @xcite .",
    "in fact , our scenario does not stipulate where the ` early ' scattering component comes from , although the most plausible source is it being perturbed out from the planetesimal - rich giant - planet region interior to 30  au . at the time of neptune s jump",
    ", this early scattering population must extend to @xmath24250  au in order to allow efficient trapping into the well - stocked distant resonances .",
    "the mechanism that causes this early scattering population ( which is the source for all hot kuiper belt populations ) to have the needed inclination width of @xmath259 is unclear .",
    "perhaps the giant planets somehow vertically heated the planetesimal belt before it was scattered out ( although in general scattering will pump @xmath9 and @xmath19 at least as fast as @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xcite manages to produce large-@xmath25 implantations from a source disk , although the more recent @xcite study produced much colder implanted population . perhaps other now - gone ( ` rogue ' ) planets caused the initial vertical dispersion , although this too seems inefficient @xcite .",
    "very nearby stellar encounters could generate the inclinations by scattering objects ( _ eg .",
    "* ) but preserving the @xmath260 cold disk in a @xmath744  au ring is a very strong constraint .",
    "the following estimates of sub - populations are intended only to provide a coherent picture to a factor of 3 or so , with all population estimates for @xmath5 ( roughly @xmath6100  km ) .",

    "in addition , @xcite report that the plutinos make up about 20% of the non - resonant objects implanted in the main belt , or about 10,000 objects , again reasonably in accordance with the cfeps estimate of 13,000 .",
    "this scenario is not here supported by simulations , which would need to show that ( 1 ) the cold belt could survive the process , ( 2 ) the distant resonances can be efficiently filled , and ( 3 ) the @xcite trapping fractions are not strongly affected by the hotter primordial scattering population that is required . in this scenario ,",

    "<S> this paper discusses the 3:2 , 5:2 , 2:1 , 3:1 , 5:1 , 4:3 , 5:3 , 7:3 , 5:4 , and 7:4 mean - motion resonances , all of which had cfeps detections , along with our upper limit on 1:1 neptune trojans ( which is consistent with their small population estimated elsewhere ) . for the plutinos ( tnos in the 3:2 resonance ) </S>",
    "<S> we refine the orbital element distribution given in kavelaars _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) and show that steep @xmath0-magnitude distributions ( @xmath1 , with @xmath20.80.9 ) are favoured in the range @xmath3=89 , and confirm that this resonance does not share the inclination distribution of the classical kuiper belt . </S>",
    "<S> we give the first population estimate for the 5:2 resonance and find that , to within the uncertainties , the population is equal to that of the 3:2 ( @xmath4 13,000 tnos with @xmath5 ) , whereas the 2:1 population is smaller by a factor of 34 compared to the other two resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure significant populations inhabiting the 4:3 , 5:3 , 7:3 , 5:4 , 7:4 , 3:1 , and 5:1 resonances , with @xmath5 ( @xmath6100  km ) populations in the thousands . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our intrinsic population and orbital - element distributions with several published models of resonant - tno production ; the most striking discrepancy is that resonances beyond the 2:1 are in reality more heavily populated than in published models . </S>"
