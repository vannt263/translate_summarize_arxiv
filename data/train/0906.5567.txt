    "understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is one of the most exciting problems facing particle physics today . the standard model ( sm ) , though phenomenologically successful , relies crucially on the existence of a scalar particle , the higgs boson @xcite , which has not been discovered in collider experiments . over the last few years ,",
    "higgsless models @xcite have emerged as a novel way of understanding the mechanism of ewsb without the presence of a scalar particle in the spectrum . in an extra dimensional context , these can be understood in terms of a @xmath1 gauge theory in the bulk of a finite @xmath2 spacetime @xcite , with symmetry breaking encoded in the boundary conditions of the gauge fields .",
    "these models can be thought of as dual to technicolor models , in the language of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "one can understand the low energy properties of such theories in a purely four dimensional picture by invoking the idea of deconstruction @xcite .",
    "the `` bulk '' of the extra dimension is then replaced by a chain of gauge groups strung together by non linear sigma model fields .",
    "the spectrum typically includes extra sets of charged and neutral vector bosons and heavy fermions .",
    "the unitarization of longitudinal @xmath3 boson scattering is accomplished by diagrams involving the exchange of the heavy gauge bosons @xcite , instead of a higgs .",
    "a general analysis of higgsless models @xcite suggests that to satisfy the requirements of precision electroweak constraints , the sm fermions have to be ` delocalized ' into the bulk .",
    "the particular kind of delocalization that helps satisfy the precision electroweak constraints ,  ideal fermion delocalization \" @xcite , dictates that the light fermions be delocalized in such a way that they do not couple to the heavy charged gauge bosons . the simplest framework that captures all these ideas , a three site higgsless model , is presented in @xcite , where there is just one gauge group in the bulk and correspondingly , only one set of heavy vector bosons .",
    "it was shown that the twin constraints of getting the correct value of the top quark mass and having an admissible @xmath4 parameter necessarily push the heavy fermion masses into the tev regime @xcite in that model .    in this paper",
    ", we seek to decouple these constraints by combining the higgsless mechanism with aspects of topcolor @xcite .",
    "the goal is to separate the bulk of electroweak symmetry breaking from third family mass generation . in this way",
    ", one can obtain a massive top quark and heavy fermions in the sub tev region , without altering tree level electroweak predictions . in an attempt to present a minimal model with these features ,",
    "we modify the three site model by adding a `` top higgs '' field , @xmath5 that couples preferentially to the top quark .",
    "the resulting model is shown in moose notation @xcite in figure 1 ; we will refer to it as the `` top triangle moose '' to distinguish it from other three - site ring models in the literature in which all of the links are non - linear sigmal models , such as the ring model explored in @xcite or bess @xcite and hidden local symmetry @xcite theories .",
    "the idea of a top higgs is motivated by top condensation models , ranging from the top mode standard model @xcite to topcolor assisted technicolor@xcite , to the top quark seesaw @xcite to bosonic topcolor @xcite .",
    "the specific framework constructed here is most closely aligned with topcolor assisted technicolor theories @xcite in which ewsb occurs via technicolor interactions while the top mass has a dynamical component arising from topcolor interactions and a small component generated by an extended technicolor mechanism .",
    "the dynamical bound state arising from topcolor dynamics can be identified as a composite top higgs field , and the low - energy spectrum includes a top higgs boson . the extra link in our triangle moose that corresponds to the top higgs field results in the presence of uneaten goldstone bosons , the top pions , which couple preferentially to the third generation .",
    "the model can thus be thought of as the deconstructed version of a topcolor assisted technicolor model .",
    "we start by presenting the model in section ii , and describing the electroweak sector .",
    "the gauge sector is the same as in bess @xcite or hidden local symmetry @xcite theories , while the fermion sector is generalized from that of the three site model @xcite and the symmetry - breaking sector resembles that of topcolor - assisted technicolor @xcite . in section iii , we compute the masses and wave functions of the gauge bosons and describe the limits in which we work .",
    "we then move on to consider the fermionic sector in section iv . here",
    ", we also explain how the ideal delocalization condition works for the light fermions . in section",
    "v , we compute the couplings of the fermions to the charged and neutral gauge bosons . in section",
    "vi , the top quark sector is presented .",
    "after calculating the mass of the top quark , we describe how the top quark is delocalized in this model by looking at the tree level value of the @xmath6 coupling . in section vii",
    ", we carry out the detailed collider phenomenology of the heavy @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks . after comparing our phenomenological analysis with others in the literature in section viii ,",
    "we present our conclusions in section ix .",
    "before we present the details of our model , we recall the essential features of the closely related three site model that @xcite pertain to the heavy fermion mass .",
    "the three site model is a maximally deconstructed version of a higgsless extra dimensional model , with only one extra @xmath9 gauge group , as compared to the sm .",
    "thus , there are three extra gauge bosons , which contribute to unitarizing the @xmath10 scattering in place of a higgs .",
    "the lhc phenomenology of these extra vector bosons is discussed in @xcite .",
    "also incorporated in the three site model is a heavy dirac partner for every sm fermion .",
    "the presence of these new fermions , in particular , the heavy top and bottom quarks , gives rise to new one - loop contributions to @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the ratio of the strengths of the low energy isotriplet neutral and charged current interactions .",
    "precision measurements require @xmath0 to be @xmath11 and this constraint , along with the need to obtain the large top quark mass , pushes the heavy quark mass into the multi tev range , too high to be seen at the lhc .",
    "we seek to reduce this tension by separating the top quark mass generation from the rest of electroweak symmetry breaking in this model , an approach motivated by top - color scenarios .",
    "the electroweak gauge structure of our model is @xmath12 .",
    "this is shown using moose notation @xcite in figure [ fig : triangle ] , in which the @xmath9 groups are associated with sites 0 and 1 , and the @xmath13 group is associated with site 2 .",
    "is embedded as a gauged @xmath14 of @xmath9  see eqn .",
    "( [ eq : sigma12d ] ) below . ] the sm fermions deriving their @xmath9 charges mostly from site 0 ( which is most closely associated with the sm @xmath9 ) and the bulk fermions mostly from site 1 . the extended electroweak gauge structure of the theory is the same as that of the bess models @xcite , motivated by models of hidden local symmetry ( with @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "gauge structure of the model in moose notation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 coupling @xmath16 and @xmath13 coupling @xmath17 of sites 0 and 2 are approximately the sm @xmath9 and hypercharge gauge couplings , while the @xmath9 coupling @xmath18 represents the bulk gauge coupling .",
    "the left ( right ) handed light fermions are mostly localized at site 0 ( 2 ) while their heavy counterparts are mostly at site 1 .",
    "the links connecting sites 0 and 1 and sites 1 and 2 are non linear sigma model fields while the one connecting sites 0 and 2 is a linear sigma field . , width=192 ]    the non linear sigma field @xmath19 is responsible for breaking the @xmath20 gauge symmetry down to @xmath9 , and field @xmath21 is responsible for breaking @xmath22 down to @xmath13 .",
    "the left handed fermions are @xmath9 doublets residing at sites 0 ( @xmath23 ) and 1 ( @xmath24 ) , while the right handed fermions are a doublet under @xmath25(@xmath26 ) and two @xmath9-singlet fermions at site 2 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the fermions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 have @xmath13 charges ( @xmath29 ) typical of the left - handed @xmath9 doublets in the sm , @xmath30 for quarks and @xmath31 for leptons .",
    "similarly , the fermion @xmath27 has a @xmath13 charge typical for the right - handed up - quarks ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath28 has the @xmath13 charge typical for the right - handed down - quarks ( @xmath33 ) ; the right - handed leptons would , likewise , have @xmath13 charges corresponding to their sm hypercharge values . also , the the third component of isospin , @xmath34 , takes values @xmath35 for `` up '' type fermions and @xmath31 for `` down '' type fermions , just like in the sm .",
    "the electric charge assignment follows the relation @xmath36 .",
    "the fermion charge assignments of the quarks are summarized in table [ tab : chargeswredux ] ; leptons follow a similar pattern .",
    ".electroweak charge assignments of the quarks .",
    "leptons follow a similar pattern . [",
    "tab : chargeswredux ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the leptonic @xmath3 decay introduces the usual two fold ambiguity in determining the neutrino momentum and hence , we have performed a transverse mass analysis of the process , defining the transverse mass variable @xcite of interest as : @xmath37 we expect the distribution to fall sharply at @xmath38 in the narrow width approximation , and indeed we find that there are typically few or no events beyond @xmath39 gev in the distributions ( see figure [ fig : single distributions ] ) .",
    "thus , we take the signal events to be those in the transverse mass window : @xmath40    we show a contour plot of the number of signal events for an intergrated luminosity of 100 @xmath41 in figure ( [ fig : single - events ] ) .",
    "it is seen that there are no events in the @xmath42 region because we require the heavy quarks to decay to @xmath43 .",
    "also , in the region of interest , one can see that there is an appreciable number of events .     for an integrated luminosity of 100",
    "@xmath44 the shaded region is where @xmath45 and is non perturbative .",
    "one can see there is a considerable number of events in the low @xmath46 region of the parameter space , width=288 ]    the sm background for this process , @xmath47 , was calculated summing over the @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 , @xmath51 and gluon jets and the first two families of leptons . since we apply a strong @xmath52 cut on only one of the jets ( unlike in the pair production case ) , there is a non zero sm background .",
    "we show the sm transverse mass distribution in figure [ fig : sm - wzjj ] .    , calculated by summing over the @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 , @xmath51 and gluon jets and the first two families of leptons .",
    "the bin size is 20 gev .",
    ", width=384 ]    the luminosity necessary for a @xmath53 discovery at 95% c.l . can be calculated by requiring @xmath54 , as per a gaussian distribution .",
    "it is instructive to look at the results of this analysis by combining it with the previous pair production case , as the two cover the @xmath55 and @xmath56 regions of the @xmath57 parameter space respectively .",
    "thus , we present a combined plot of the required luminosity for a @xmath53 discovery of these heavy vector quarks ( at 95% c.l . ) at the lhc in figure ( [ fig : luminosity plot ] ) .",
    "discovery of the heavy vector fermions at the lhc in the single ( blue curves , nearly horizontal ) and pair ( red curves , nearly verticle ) production channels .",
    "the shaded portion is non perturbative and not included in the study .",
    "it is seen that the two channels are complementary to one another and allow almost the entire region to be covered in 300 @xmath44 , width=288 ]    one can see that almost the entire parameter space is covered , with the pair and single production channels nicely complementing each other . before we conclude , however , we would like to comment briefly on how our analysis compares with other models with vector quarks .",
    "there are many other theories that feature heavy quarks with vector like couplings , as in the present model . in this section",
    ", we would like to briefly explain how our phenomenological analysis compares with these .",
    "one important feature of deconstructed higgsless models of the kind discussed in this paper is ideal fermion delocalization , which does not allow the heavy charged gauge bosons in the theory to couple to two standard model fermions .",
    "this constrains the @xmath43 to decay only to @xmath3 and @xmath58 , thus providing a tool to distinguish this class of models from others .",
    "there are , however , certain features of this model that are generic , like the vector nature of the heavy quark couplings .    in the context of little higgs models",
    "@xcite , there have been studies of the lhc phenomenology of the t - odd heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for the production of heavy t - quark pairs are comparable to the ones in our study . however , in those models , the heavy t - quark necessarily decays to a heavy photon ( due to constraints of conserving t parity ) .",
    "also , in @xcite , the authors study the pair production of heavy partners of the 1st and 2nd generation quarks in the context of the littlest higgs models @xcite .",
    "they consider decays exclusively to the heavy gauge bosons in the theory , which then decay to the standard model gauge bosons plus a heavy photon .",
    "thus , the final state , though still @xmath59 , is kinematically different . in particular , strong cuts on the missing energy are now an important part of the analysis , because part of @xmath60 is due to the heavy photons .",
    "ref.@xcite presents a comprehensive study of the production and decay of heavy quarks by separating out the partners of the 3rd generation from the others and analysing them separately .",
    "the authors let the heavy quark decay to a sm @xmath3 boson and a light quark , but in their analysis , they neglect the mass of the @xmath3 boson compared to its momentum ( since it is highly boosted ) . thus , when the @xmath3 decays to a @xmath61 pair , the direction of the neutrino momentum can be approximated to be parallel to that of the charged lepton , which enables them to recontruct the full neutrino momentum and create an invariant mass peak for the heavy quark ( as opposed to a transverse mass analysis ) . clearly , the final states and/or kinematics in all of these analyses differ significantly from those considered in our analysis .",
    "in the context of the three site model , the authors of @xcite consider the single production of the heavy top quark .",
    "as mentioned before , the heavy top in this model is necessarily around a few tev s and the paper concludes that the most viable channel for detection at the lhc is the subprocess @xmath62 with the @xmath3 decaying leptonically . we have not yet studied heavy top or top - pion phenomenology in our model .    ref .",
    "@xcite presents a model independent analysis of the discovery prospects of heavy quarks at the tevatron .",
    "the authors write down generic charged and neutral current interactions mixing the heavy and the light fermions and proceed to analyze both the pair and single production of these heavy quarks , with decays to the sm gauge bosons .",
    "understandably , the tevatron reach is much lower than that of the lhc .",
    "higgsless models have emerged as an alternative to the standard model in explaining the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "these theories use boundary conditions to break gauge symmetries and can be understood in terms of four dimensional gauge theories via the process of deconstruction . a minimal model along these lines",
    "was recently presented @xcite , which employed just three sites .",
    "a natural feature of this model was the presence of partners to the sm fermions whose masses were of the order of a few tev or more , because of the twin constraints of getting the top quark mass right and having the @xmath4 parameter under experimental bounds .    in this paper",
    ", we presented a minimal extension of the three site model that incorporates both higgsless and top - color mechanisms .",
    "the model singles out top quark mass generation as arising from a yukawa coupling to an effective top - higgs , which develops a small vacuum expectation value , while electroweak symmetry breaking results largely from a higgsless mechanism .",
    "an interesting consequence is that there is no longer a conflict between the need to obtain a realistically large value for the top quark mass and the need to keep @xmath0 small enough to conform to experiment . as a result ,",
    "in this model it is possible to have additional vector - like quarks in the model that are light enough to be discovered at the lhc , without affecting the tree level couplings of the three site model too much .",
    "we encoded the model in calchep and analyzed the phenomenology of the heavy quarks .",
    "we first considered pair production ( @xmath63 ) of these heavy fermions .",
    "we found that the 5@xmath64 reach of the pair production channel was @xmath65 1 tev , with the maximum reach in the region where @xmath66 where the heavy quark must decay to a @xmath3 or @xmath58 .",
    "the single production channel ( @xmath67 ) complements this nicely because we can study the decay of the heavy quark to a @xmath43 , and hence are necessarily in the region @xmath55 . by combining both these analyses",
    ", we were able to cover most of the @xmath68 parameter space .",
    "we conclude that the reach at the lhc for a 5@xmath64 discovery at 95% c.l . of the vector quarks in this theory",
    "can be as high as 1.2 tev for an appropriate choice of @xmath46 .",
    "other components of the theory with potentially interesting phenomenology are the heavy partners of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 quarks and the uneaten top pions that arise from the extra link in the moose diagram ( figure 1 ) and couple preferentially to the third generation .",
    "the phenomenology of these states is currently under investigation .",
