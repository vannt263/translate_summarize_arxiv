    "the existence of dark matter is now established beyond reasonable doubt by a variety of independent observations  @xcite .",
    "these require the presence of substantial amounts of non - baryonic dark matter at vastly different scales ranging from individual galaxies to superclusters and filaments . despite the overwhelming amount of gravitational evidence ,",
    "however , no unambiguous evidence for non - gravitational dark matter interactions has been discovered to this day . since a determination of the particle nature of the dark matter from its gravitational interactions alone is impossible , searches for non - gravitational signatures of dark matter are of paramount importance .",
    "one of the principal approaches to its identification is the indirect detection of dark matter via searches for exotic components in the cosmic radiation produced by dark matter interactions with standard model particles . for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , it was pointed out some decades ago that the dark matter self - annihilation processes that can yield the correct thermal relic abundance might still occur today at a rate high enough to give rise to a flux of cosmic rays and photons that may be detectable by suitable telescopes .",
    "however , the self - annihilation of dark matter is not the only possible scenario for indirect dark matter detection .",
    "namely , the dark matter might be unstable and decay into standard model particles , even though it must have a very long lifetime in order to survive from its production in the early universe to the present day",
    ". if the dark matter is not perfectly stabilized by some unbroken symmetry , however , the possiblity exists that its decay products may leave visible traces in cosmic - ray fluxes . indeed , in some well - motivated models the dark matter particles are not perfectly stable , but decay with cosmological lifetimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "among the possible indirect detection channels , measurements of cosmic - ray antimatter are particularly sensitive to exotic contributions from dark matter .",
    "interestingly , the pamela telescope has recently confirmed the existence of a dramatic rise in the positron fraction extending up to energies of at least 100 gev  @xcite , in stark contrast with expectations from conventional models of cosmic - ray production and propagation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fermi gamma - ray space telescope has observed a total flux of electrons and positrons that is harder than expected  @xcite , also indicating the possible presence of an additional component of charged cosmic - ray leptons  @xcite .",
    "various astrophysical explanations for these unexpected behaviors have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "arguably more exciting , however , is the possibility that the excess of positrons and electrons is due to the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles .",
    "however , measurements of cosmic - ray antiprotons , in particular measurements of the antiproton - to - proton ratio by pamela  @xcite , yield stringent constraints on the fraction of dark matter decays or annihilations into hadronic final states .",
    "this has lead some authors to consider ` leptophilic ' models of dark matter  @xcite , where the dark matter is coupled predominantly or exclusively to charged leptons . in the following , we consider the possibility that the dark matter particles are indeed unstable , but decay leptonically with extremely long lifetimes .",
    "more precisely , the interpretation of the leptonic cosmic - ray anomalies observed by pamela and fermi in terms of dark matter decay suggests a lifetime of the dark matter on the order of @xmath0 seconds ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this lifetime exceeds the age of the universe by nine orders of magnitude , thus leaving the dark matter sufficiently stable on cosmological timescales .",
    "nevertheless , due to the large amounts of dark matter in the universe , even for such enormous lifetimes the resulting fluxes can be in the observable range .",
    "indeed , strong constraints on decaying dark matter have been derived recently from gamma - ray observations of galaxy clusters and nearby galaxies  @xcite .    in this paper , we examine some of the effects of leptophilic models of decaying dark matter which arise at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory and show that they can have relevance to indirect dark matter searches .",
    "we will not speculate on the precise nature of the particle physics that could give rise to leptophilic dark matter decay .",
    "instead , our approach will be to examine simple models where we assume effective interactions that describe the desired leptophilic coupling of dark matter particles to charged leptons . the salient point for us here",
    "is that even if one assumes an exclusive coupling of the dark matter to charged leptons at tree level , this behavior is only valid at leading order , while at next - to - leading order other particles , including photons and weak gauge bosons , will be produced . indeed ,",
    "these higher - order corrections have been analyzed in the past for the case of annihilating dark matter  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the higher - order corrections in the form of internal bremsstrahlung or from final - state radiation of weak gauge bosons can even dominate under certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "the decay modes induced by higher - order corrections are usually suppressed by powers of the couplings and possibly loop factors , as opposed to the leading - order decay modes .",
    "this means that the resulting decay products will be difficult to detect unless they possess some distinct features .",
    "weak gauge bosons can be produced , for instance , via final - state radiation off the charged leptons  @xcite . by their subsequent hadronization",
    ", the massive gauge bosons will then generate hadronic particles , including antiprotons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , every leptophilic dark matter model that aims to explain the leptonic cosmic - ray anomalies also serves as a source of antiprotons .    in this work , however , we will focus on complementary constraints arising from a different decay channel induced by higher - order effects .",
    "namely , we will study radiative two - body decays involving photons .",
    "these are particularly interesting , since they give rise to monochromatic lines in the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum or in extragalactic sources .",
    "such lines are of utmost importance because astrophysical processes generally generate continuous gamma - ray spectra .",
    "thus , the observation of a gamma - ray line would be a compelling signature of an underlying particle physics process . in some cases ,",
    "a gamma - ray line can be produced already in tree level decays  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we demonstrate that for leptophilic models of dark matter , the ratio between leading - order and next - to - leading - order decay modes can be large enough to produce a potentially observable gamma - ray line signal .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fermionicdm ] , we discuss the production of monochromatic photons from radiative two - body decays induced at the one - loop level for fermionic dark matter particles in a simple leptophilic toy model . in section  [ sec : scalardm ] , we examine the corresponding case for a scalar dark matter particle . next , in section  [ sec : observational_constraints ] , we discuss observational constraints on gamma - ray lines in the gev to tev region and compare existing bounds with the expected signal from dark matter decay .",

    "for example , scenario 5 differs from 6 just by the sign of @xmath101 , but is much more difficult to probe by the cta .",
    "finally , for benchmark point 7 , we assume that the couplings of the leptons to @xmath74 and to @xmath73 have opposite chirality , in which case the loop is strongly suppressed and there is no hope of detecting a gamma - ray line signal .",
    "we have analyzed the radiative decay of dark matter particles in view of the leptonic cosmic - ray anomalies reported by pamela and fermi lat . assuming an effective description of leptophilic dark matter decay , we have pointed out that the lines induced at the quantum level may be observable and can be used to constrain models of decaying dark matter . in the case of scalar dark matter",
    ", two - body decays into photons are strongly helicity - suppressed and thus unobservable . in the case that the dark matter particles carry spin 1/2 , however , the radiative decay rate is typically suppressed compared to the tree - level decays by some two to three orders of magnitude .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding partial lifetimes for decays into monochromatic photons can then be in the observable range , in particular for dark matter masses of a few hundred gev , where stringent constraints from fermi lat apply .",
    "thus , in some cases the loop - induced gamma - ray line yields constraints that can be competitive with the constraints on charged cosmic rays . at higher energies ,",
    "constraints from cherenkov telescopes exist . at present , these constraints are only relevant for certain scenarios for which the radiative two - body decay is kinematically enhanced compared to the three - body decay channel .",
    "however , we have pointed out that the proposed cta should be able to improve on the existing bounds significantly and probe a relevant part of the parameter space which is presently unconstrained .",
