    "circumstellar disks are supposed to form as natural by - products of star formation processes due to large angular momenta in natal molecular cloud cores .",
    "although extensive observational and theoretical studies have been done , theories of disk formation are not complete yet .",
    "a disk plays crucial roles in star formation and evolution since its presence affects the evolution of the central star and its feedback .",
    "moreover , circumstellar disks , or protoplanetary disks , are very important not only in the context of star formation but also of planet formation because they are the sites of planet formation .",
    "therefore , it is of crucial importance to construct a consistent model of circumstellar disk formation in the context of star formation .",
    "the key to understand disk formation is angular momentum redistribution during protostellar collapse .",
    "gravitational torque is important when magnetic fields are weak @xcite , but typically magnetic fields observed in molecular clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are strong enough to remove angular momenta efficiently and overcome the centrifugal barrier @xcite",
    ". however , this magnetic braking is in fact too effective and strongly suppresses formation of rotationally supported disks and binary / multiples at least in the early phase of star formation and with the ideal mhd approximation , which is called the magnetic braking catastrophe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or fragmentation crisis @xcite .    obviously this problem can not be real because many protoplanetary disks and extra - solar planets have been observed , and because the fraction of binaries or multiples is known to be high ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , there must be something missing in those early simulations which were highly idealized and simplified .",
    "this problem has been actively discussed recently and many solutions have been proposed .",
    "for example , non - ideal mhd effects such as ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion can redistribute magnetic flux and suppress angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "mis - alignment between magnetic fields and the rotational axis can reduce the efficiency of magnetic braking and enable disk formation when magnetic fields are not too strong @xcite . or simply , a circumstellar disk can form later when the surrounding envelope almost disappears and magnetic braking becomes inefficient @xcite .",
    "turbulence that ubiquitously exists in star forming clouds is another promising mechanism , but there are various interpretations how it circumvents the magnetic braking catastrophe ; diffusion or reconnection enhanced by turbulence can redistribute magnetic fields @xcite , incoherent magnetic fields are less efficient to transport angular momentum @xcite , it can naturally induce mis - alignment between magnetic fields and rotation @xcite , or simply turbulence carries additional angular momentum locally .",
    "given such many solutions proposed , the magnetic braking catastrophe is not so catastrophic as it sounds , but it still remains as quantitative questions ; when and how is a disk formed , and how large ( massive ) is it ?",
    "it is observationally well known that star forming clouds are strongly magnetized .",
    "magnetic fields in dense molecular cloud cores are slightly weaker than or comparable to the critical field strength required to support those cloud cores @xcite",
    ". observations of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects also have been actively carried out .",
    "@xcite performed interferometric observations toward class-0 sources , and compared them with numerical simulations with and without magnetic fields .",
    "they did not detect largely - extended circumstellar disks , suggesting that the effects of magnetic fields are significant in formation and early evolution of circumstellar disks .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claimed that they found a large circumstellar disk with a radius of @xmath0 around a very young class-0 object l1527 irs , one of the best - studied examples .",
    "while this result was striking , @xcite observed the same object with higher resolution and sensitivity using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , and concluded that the disk radius should be about or smaller than @xmath1 . clearly more detailed and extensive observations",
    "are needed , but overall , these observations imply that young circumstellar disks should be small , while they could form in the early phase of star formation and should grow later .    thus magnetic fields play crucial roles in star formation , and therefore their effects must be carefully clarified and quantified . because the ionization degree in star forming clouds are extremely low , redistribution of magnetic fields by non - ideal mhd effects is naturally expected and has a significant impact on angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects are also important in the context of the magnetic flux problem , which means that typical magnetic flux in initial molecular cloud cores is far larger than that in formed stars by orders of magnitude and therefore substantial flux redistribution is required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the non - ideal mhd effects and disk formation during protostellar collapse . for this purpose ,",
    "we perform three - dimensional rmhd simulations of protostellar collapse including non - ideal mhd effects . in @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    ", we found that ohmic dissipation can redistribute magnetic flux from the dense region and enable formation of rotationally supported disks around protostellar cores . in this paper , we extend our simulations to include ambipolar diffusion , which is more efficient in the lower density region .",

    "the equations and numerical methods are explained in section 2 , and the models used in the simulations are described in section 3 .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussion and conclusions are summarized in section 6 . in the appendix , we describe the newly implemented solver for the non - ideal mhd effects and demonstrate its validity .",
    "in order to study protostellar collapse , many physical processes must be properly taken into account , such as mhd , self - gravity , radiation transfer , chemistry and non - ideal mhd effects . in paper",
    "i , we only considered ohmic dissipation as non - ideal mhd effects . in this work ,",

    "the multigrid solver @xcite is used for self - gravity .",
    "the time step for the mhd and radiation transfer parts is determined by the courant - friedrich - levy ( cfl ) condition for the mhd part , and the radiation subsystem is solved implicitly .",
    "the implementation of newly - introduced non - ideal mhd effects is described in the appendix .",
    "detailed descriptions of other parts including microphysical processes are given in paper i.    only in the model with ambipolar diffusion , we additionally introduce a density floor where magnetic fields are dominantly strong so that the time step does not become too small .",
    "when the gas density is so low that the plasma beta @xmath13 gets below @xmath14 , the gas density is increased so that @xmath15 becomes @xmath14 while the gas temperature and velocity are unchanged .",
    "this floor works only in the very low density region in the infalling envelope just above the first core .",
    "we monitor the mass added by this density floor and confirm it is very small , about @xmath16 in total , or less than 0.1% of the first core mass .",
    "even with this density floor , the time step is limited by the alfvn speed in the low density region above the first core in the model with ambipolar diffusion , and as a result an excessive number of time steps are required .",
    "it is important to solve the energy equations including the effects of radiation transfer , although radiation does not drastically affect the evolution in the early phase of star formation compared to the previous simulations using the barotropic approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiation heating and cooling are only crudely treated in the barotropic approximation , and heating by the non - ideal mhd effects is completely neglected . in reality",
    ", the thermal evolution varies depending on many factors , but the barotropic approximation simply assumes that the gas temperature is a function of the local gas density .",
    "therefore , it can not reproduce the realistic evolution and may affect the results artificially .",
    "for example , the stability of the first core depends on the gas temperature especially when it is gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "also , the heating by the non - ideal mhd effects affects the structure of the first core ( see paper i ) , and the rates of the non - ideal mhd effects are sensitive to the gas temperature .",
    "thus it is crucial to treat both dynamics and thermodynamics consistently .",
    "we update the equation of state from paper i. now the partition function for vibration of molecular hydrogen is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the excitation temperature of vibration of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this formula is better than the previous one used in paper i because it does not diverge in the low temperature limit .",
    "however , this change has very minor impacts on the results of hydrodynamic simulations because contribution from the vibrational degrees of freedom becomes significant only in a high temperature , and most of hydrogen molecules are already dissociated there .",
    "other parameters are unchanged including the ortho : para ratio of molecular hydrogen , which is 3:1 .",
    "the ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion rate are calculated based on the method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model solves a chemical reaction network of @xmath19 and dust grains , and derive equilibrium solutions .",
    "in addition , we consider thermal ionization of potassium ( k ) , which produces a sudden increase of the ionization degree and sharp cut - off in the rates of the non - ideal mhd effects around @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the reaction rates from the umist rate 2012 database @xcite .",
    "dust grains can be charged from -14 to + 14 .",
    "we assume that the dust to gas ratio is 0.01 , the dust density is @xmath21 , and the size of the dust particles is @xmath22 .",
    "the ohmic resistivity in this work is higher than that in paper i in the low density region , by about a factor of 3 in most regions except for the sharp increase around @xmath23 ( see figure  [ rate ] below ) . in paper",
    "i , this rise occurs around a higher density , @xmath24 .",
    "these differences result in larger angular momenta remaining in the first cores , but the results are still qualitatively similar .",
    "we simply adopt a constant ionization rate @xmath25 , assuming cosmic rays are the dominant ionization source and neglecting their shielding . in dense regions where cosmic rays can not penetrate ,",
    "this assumption overestimates the ionization rate and hence underestimates the diffusion rates .",
    "the ionization rate in such regions is generally determined by decay of radioactive elements . at least for our solar system",
    ", there is meteoritic evidence that short - lived radionuclides such as @xmath26 existed when the solar nebula formed @xcite . as discussed in paper i , these short - lived nuclides yield an ionization rate of @xmath27 @xcite . in this case , neglecting cosmic - ray shielding would have only a moderate impact . by contrast , the ionization rate in dense regions can be extremely low if only long - lived radio active nuclides such as @xmath28 exist @xcite . because the lifetime of @xmath26 is short and is comparable to the time scale of star formation , its abundance would vary in each system .",
    "therefore this is an environmental parameter rather than an uncertainty . in this work",
    ", we aim to demonstrate that disk formation is possible even with the conservative case with the high ionization rate ( i.e. the resulting non - ideal mhd effects are weak ) as the first step .",
    "another significant simplification in our model is that dust particles have a single population of @xmath22 , neglecting their distribution and evolution .",
    "while dust grains can grow in collapsing clouds , they also can be spattered at shocks . on the other hand ,",
    "dust grains evaporate at high temperatures .",
    "although the effects of dust evaporation are taken into account in the opacities @xcite , they are not included in our rates .",
    "specifically , water ices evaporate around @xmath29 , while silicates evaporate around @xmath30 .",
    "the latter has no significant impact on the rates because thermal ionization of potassium occurs below that temperature , and magnetic fields and gas are well coupled there .",
    "the evaporation of water ices , however , can be important but its effect strongly depends on dust properties such as composition and structures , which are highly uncertain .",
    "thus the rates of the non - ideal mhd effects have large uncertainties , and they would vary in different environments . therefore , despite the detailed calculation of the rates , our simulations should be considered as an experiment with a typical model , and broad parameter surveys must be performed in the future .",

    "if _ in paper i , and model _ o _ is similar to _ rf _ in paper i.    initially the clouds collapse isothermally because radiation cooling is very effective , but the gas starts to evolve almost adiabatically when the central density exceeds about @xmath62 .",
    "then the temperature quickly rises and quasi - hydrostatic objects , the first cores , are formed @xcite .",
    "the formation of the first core is slightly earlier in model _ oa _ , because ambipolar diffusion redistributes the magnetic flux before the gas becomes dense enough to form a first core , and it slightly weaken deceleration of the infall motion by magnetic fields .",
    "however , this is not significant because the dynamical collapse is much faster than the redistribution of the magnetic fields , and the difference is only 1% compared to the time from the beginning of the collapse to the formation of the first core .",
    "it should be noted that this difference depends on the stability of the initial condition .",
    "if the initial condition is sufficiently unstable ( super critical ) , ambipolar diffusion has only minor impact on the initial isothermal collapse ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the first core in model _ oa _ becomes disk - like and is clearly supported by rotation , although contribution of the gas pressure is still substantial .",
    "the non - ideal mhd effects also provide additional heating as in eq.([energy ] ) , and the gas element follows a hotter ( i.e. higher entropy ) evolution track in model _ o _ , and it is more prominent in _ oa _ ( figure  [ rhot ] ) .",

    "ambipolar diffusion works effectively in the broader range than the ohmic dissipation ( @xmath72 ) , removes magnetic flux and suppresses angular momentum transport more significantly .",
    "both the ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion rates drop sharply when the gas temperature exceeds about @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) because the gas and magnetic fields recouple by thermal ionization of potassium ( k ) .",
    "first , we compare the outflows driven around the first cores .",
    "vertical cross sections of the density and temperature in this scale are presented in figure  [ outflow ] .",

    "the difference of the driving radii between the models is simply originated from the ages of the systems , because accreting angular momenta get larger as the systems evolve .",
    "the sizes of the outflows are significantly different between the models .",
    "before the end of the first core phase , the outflows extend vertically about 70 au in model _ i _ , 80 au in _ o _ , and 170 au in _ oa_. however , the structures and velocities of the outflows are similar , about @xmath77 in all the cases .",
    "this is because the non - ideal mhd effects , both ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion , only work in the high density region within the first core , and do not affect the driving regions which are located outside the first cores as discussed above ( figure  [ prof ] ) .",
    "therefore , the larger sizes in the non - ideal mhd models are solely consequences of the longer first core lifetimes by rotational support .    while the outflow structures are quite similar , the temperature distribution in this scale is prominently warmer in model _ oa _ than the other models .",
    "this is because the first core in _ oa _ is more massive and hotter , and heats up the surrounding material by radiation more strongly .",
    "because of the longer lifetime and higher luminosity , the probability of finding a first core by observations would be higher than previously expected , although it should be still very rare because the lifetime is still much shorter than the timescale of the whole star formation process .",
    "another noticeable difference in the outflows is that a polar cavity with a very low density is formed in model _",
    "oa_. the gas near the pole is removed by accretion and the centrifugal force , rather than expelled by the outflow itself .",
    "the opening angle of this cavity is still very narrow in the early phase , but it will expand as the gas in the outer envelope with higher angular momenta will accrete later .",
    "although it is not very likely , this cavity might enable us to observe the central object more directly if it is in a face - on configuration .      as we can see in figure  [ rate ] , the non - ideal mhd effects are most active in the dense region within the first cores and significant magnetic flux loss occurs where the reynolds number gets below unity .",
    "as a result , much more prominent differences between the models arise in the first core evolution and structures .",
    "figure  [ fcprop ] shows evolution of the masses , angular momenta and mass - to - flux ratios of the first cores . in order to produce these graphs ,",

    "i _ is essentially the same as that in model _ if _ of paper i. magnetic braking is so efficient that almost all the angular momentum in the first core is removed , and the first core is virtually spherically symmetric and not rotating ( figures  [ prof ] and [ modeli ] ) .",
    "the first core mass and radius at the end of the first core phase are about @xmath81 and 3 au . the first core and outer pseudo - disk exhibit strong warping , which is driven by the magnetic interchange instability @xcite . the angular momentum in the first core decreases as it evolves .",
    "the two sharp  wedges \" are induced by strong perturbation from the magnetic interchange instability , indicating that the first core angular momentum is very small ( essentially zero ) and is easily dominated by the external warping . because the thermal pressure and rotational support are smaller in this model than in the others , and the magnetic pressure is not significant , the first core mass is the smallest in this model .    to see the degree of magnetization",
    ", we look into the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath82 of the first cores . the magnetic flux threading a first core",
    "is measured by integrating the vertical magnetic flux density over the mid - plane as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the surface area of a discretized cell , and the summation is taken over the mid - plane .",
    "this formula captures the total magnetic flux correctly when the mid - plane is the plane of symmetry . in model _",
    "i _ , the symmetry breaks down by the magnetic interchange instability after the central density exceeds a few @xmath85 , while the other two models maintain the symmetry during the first core phase .",
    "therefore , the mass - to - flux ratio in model _ i _ after the sharp increase is not accurate , and it only gives the upper limit . instead , it is more appropriate to assume this value is almost unchanged beyond this point ( the red - dotted line in figure  [ fcprop ] ) because the time after this is very short and the first core acquires only a little mass ( see figure  [ rt ] ) . taking this point into account",
    ", the first core magnetization remains almost constant during the first core phase in the ideal mhd model .    in the large scale ,",
    "the magnetic fields look like the so - called hourglass shape .",
    "the field lines are tangled near and within the first core because of the magnetic interchange instability ( figure  [ bf ] ) . because the first core is not rotating ,",
    "the field lines are not wound up .",
    "after the second collapse begins , the gas collapses dynamically and a protostellar core is formed very quickly in a few years .",
    "the protostellar core is also virtually spherical because almost no angular momentum exists in the protostellar core ( at least shortly after its formation ) .",
    "the protostellar core properties are essentially the same as a spherical model without rotation and magnetic fields ( paper i ) .      model _ o _ is very similar to model _",
    "rf _ in paper i , although the ohmic dissipation rate in this work is higher than the one used in paper i. distribution of dissipative regions are shown in figure  [ reynolds ] ( the top row ) using the magnetic reynolds number @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the local jeans length .",
    "because ohmic dissipation works only in the high density region within the first core , the first core properties ( figure  [ fcprop ] ) are identical to those in model _",
    "i _ when it is formed .",
    "as the first core evolves , the magnetic flux is redistributed outwardly by ohmic dissipation .",
    "the gas and magnetic fields recouple in the central region after the thermal ionization of potassium begins , but the outer region remains resistive and the mass - to - flux ratio increases monotonically . at the end of the first core phase ,",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio is about three times higher than in model _ i_. angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is significantly suppressed , and the first core acquires a large angular momentum , which also monotonically increases . as a result ,",
    "the first core has considerable rotation and evolves slightly more slowly than model _ i _ ( figure  [ rt ] ) .",
    "however , the rotation is not fast enough to support the first core and its structure remains almost spherical ( figures  [ prof ] and [ modelo ] ) . at the end of the first core phase ,",
    "the mass and radius are about 0.04 @xmath88 and 5 au , which are larger than the ideal mhd case because of additional support by rotation and heat produced by ohmic dissipation ( figure  [ rhot ] , see also paper i ) . however , these differences in the first cores are rather minor .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , ohmic dissipation does not have a drastic impact on the first core structure and evolution .",
    "the magnetic fields in the outer region of the first core are straightened out by the strong ohmic resistivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic fields are tightly wound up and amplified by the shearing rotation in the hot recoupled region near the center of the first core ( figures  [ bf ] and [ reynolds ] ) . the magnetic pressure in this region is not strong enough to launch outflows during the first core phase . later in the protostellar core phase ,",
    "strong toroidal magnetic fields are produced by the faster rotation in the disk and drive fast jets by the magnetic pressure ( see paper i for the detailed discussion about the protostellar cores ) .",
    "the second collapse occurs dynamically at the beginning as in model _",
    "i _ because the rotational support is not significant . however , since the gas spins up as it collapses , a rotationally supported disk forms around the protostellar core essentially in parallel .",
    "the disk size is very small , only about @xmath89 at the end of the simulation ( when @xmath90 ) . at the same time , fast bipolar jets are launched by the magnetic pressure of the toroidal magnetic fields amplified by the shearing rotation ( paper i , see also * ? ? ?",
    "this disk is larger than that in paper i as a consequence of the higher ohmic resistivity , but qualitatively the same . in this sense",
    ", ohmic dissipation resolves the magnetic braking catastrophe and enables formation of a rotationally supported disk in the early phase of star formation .",
    "we stop the simulation because the jeans condition can not be satisfied beyond this point due to the limitation of the simulation code .",
    "the first core in model _ oa _ with both ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion is qualitatively different from the other two cases .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is more effective than ohmic dissipation especially in the low density gas ( figure  [ rate ] ) , and suppresses angular momentum transport more significantly .",
    "the first core is already less magnetized from the beginning , and it loses the magnetic flux continuously during the first core phase ( figure  [ fcprop ] ) . figure  [ reynolds ] indicates that the non - ideal mhd effects work strongly in almost the whole first core , especially in the early phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "at the end of the first core phase , the mass - to - flux ratio is higher than the ideal mhd model by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is strongly suppressed in such a diffusive region , and substantial angular momentum remains within the first core . as a result ,",
    "the first core becomes a disk supported by the centrifugal force , although the gas pressure is still substantially contributing ( figure  [ prof ] ) .",
    "the rotational profile is not keplerian yet ( i.e. the rotation profile is not @xmath91 ) because of this gas pressure support and the self - gravity .",
    "the disk radius is initially about 6 au when it is formed , gradually shrinks to @xmath92 , and then remains almost constant , because magnetic braking is still working outside the resistive region and regulates angular momentum accretion .",
    "although the disk remains small until the end of the simulation , it accumulates large angular momentum as the gas accretes from the envelope .",
    "eventually it acquires almost one order of magnitude larger angular momentum than that in model _ o _ , while the mass ( @xmath93 at the end of the first core ) is larger only by a factor of two .",
    "this fast rotation is sufficient to the trigger the gravito - rotational instability @xcite , and the disk becomes non - axisymmetric in the late phase ( figure  [ modeloa ] ) .",
    "angular momentum transport by gravitational torque via non - axisymmetric structures is usually less effective than magnetic braking , but it becomes important where the magnetic fields are weakened by the non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "it is naturally expected that this disk will grow later and the rotational support will be more significant as the gas with higher angular momenta will accrete from the outer region .",
    "the magnetic flux expelled by the non - ideal mhd effects piles up outside the diffusive region ( @xmath94 ) , i.e. the first core .",
    "in this situation , the so - called magnetic wall can be formed , where the magnetic pressure strongly decelerates the infalling gas and possibly form a shock ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , such a structure is not prominent in this model , although the accretion velocity is indeed slower than the free - fall velocity due to the magnetic fields ( figure  [ prof ] ) .",
    "the outermost deceleration ( at @xmath95 ) is formed by interacting with the bipolar outflow ( see figure  [ outflow ] ) , the second one ( at @xmath96 ) is a centrifugal barrier , and the innermost one ( at @xmath97 ) is the first core shock .",
    "this is likely because our rates of the non - ideal mhd effects are not high enough , or because the simulation duration is not long enough to accumulate sufficient magnetic flux .    as discussed before",
    ", this model suggests that first cores are more readily observed because of the higher luminosity and longer lifetime .",
    "another interesting observational aspect is its variability . while mass and angular momentum transport by magnetic fields are almost steady and smooth , the gravitational torque via non - axisymmetric structures is unsteady and episodic ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the disk becomes gravitationally unstable by mass accretion or radiation cooling , non - axisymmetric structures like spiral arms are formed and transport mass and angular momentum , then the disk is stabilized again unless it is too unstable and fragments .",
    "this stochastic accretion causes the first core flickering .",
    "its time scale is corresponding to the orbital time scales , ranging from a few years to a few decades .",
    "we will discuss its observational properties in a separate paper in the near future .",
    "similar to the case with ohmic dissipation only , the magnetic field lines in the outer region of the first core are strongly straightened out , running almost vertically , by strong ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion ( figures  [ bf ] and [ reynolds ] ) .",
    "the field lines are wound up tightly near the center of the first core where the magnetic fields are coupled with the gas , but again the magnetic pressure is not dominant during the first core phase and the fields behave passively in this phase .",
    "although we stop the simulation soon after the second collapse begins ( when @xmath57 ) , we can see that the evolution during the second collapse is already different from the other two models . because it is supported by the centrifugal force",
    ", the gas does not collapse dynamically even when it loses the gas pressure support .",
    "it rather collapses gradually with a time scale much longer than the free fall .",
    "unfortunately , we have to stop the simulation at this point because the jeans condition is violated and fragmentation occurred .",
    "we can not tell but only can speculate how the system will evolve later , but it is likely that a compact binary or multiple system is formed @xcite .",
    "to summarize , ambipolar diffusion is so effective and drastically changes the first core structure .",
    "it removes magnetic flux from the first core , suppresses angular momentum transport , and enables early formation of rotationally supported disks , even before formation of the protostar .",
    "the disk is massive enough to become gravitationally unstable and becomes non - axisymmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "the disk size remains small in the early phase , contrary to purely hydrodynamic models without magnetic fields which yields very large disks supported by rotation even in the first core phase @xcite .",
    "thus , these non - ideal mhd effects can solve the magnetic braking catastrophe and maintain consistency with observations of young stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our results seem to be inconsistent with the earlier non - ideal mhd simulations by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which no rotationally supported disk was formed even with ambipolar diffusion . because there are many differences in the simulation setups including the initial conditions , comparison is not trivial but at least the diffusion rates are similar .",
    "we suspect that the most important difference between their simulations and ours is the boundary condition at the center of the cloud .",
    "they have a relatively large hole with a radius of 6.7 au , while we do not have any boundary there but resolve the small - scale structure directly using the nested - grid technique .",
    "in fact , because the disks formed in our simulations are small , it is not inconsistent with their simulations , at least in the early phase of protostellar collapse .",
    "our calculations are expensive and we can not follow the long - term evolution , but this high resolution is required to resolve the small first core disk .",
    "we believe it is crucial to resolve the first core because the non - ideal mhd effects work effectively and a rotationally supported disk is formed there .",
    "otherwise , these non - ideal mhd effects have only minor influence on the large scale evolution .",
    "indeed , @xcite demonstrated that the sink particle or inner hole has a significant impact on the results .",
    "we propose that the effects of these numerical tricks can be estimated by measuring the angular momentum accreted into the inner boundary or sink particles .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , recent interferometric observations of class-0 objects , the youngest protostars including l1527 irs , suggest that circumstellar disks in the early phase of star formation should be small , i.e. @xmath98 , while they can be formed in the early phase @xcite .",
    "these observational results do not favor previous hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar collapse without magnetic fields which tend to produce large rotationally supported disks in the early phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , our model with both ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation is consistent with this picture . in order to test the scenario , more observations of very young stellar objects with higher resolutions that can sufficiently resolve the circumstellar disks",
    "are required .",
    "in particular , if we could directly observe a first core or at least its remnant shortly after the second collapse , it would be a critical test for our models .",
    "if we could detect a compact rotating disk in a collapsing cloud but associated with no significant stellar signature ( e.g. near infrared emission or high velocity jets ) , it would be crucial evidence indicating that a rotationally supported disk is already formed in the first core phase .    from numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a first core is expected to ( 1 ) have a spectral energy distribution like a low - temperature gray body without a hot infrared stellar emission , ( 2 ) be a compact , condensed core which may exhibit a signature of infall motion , and ( 3 ) be associated with slow compact molecular outflows , but no fast jets .",
    "although first cores should be very rare due to the short lifetime that only one out of a few hundreds of molecular cloud cores are expected , some candidates are already reported @xcite . among them , l1451-mm @xcite is one of the best examples which satisfies all the above criteria .",
    "we expect that direct observation of a first core or its remnant with high resolution interferometers , especially alma , will be achieved in the near future .",
    "while the non - ideal mhd effects can avert the magnetic braking catastrophe , the magnetic flux problem may remain a serious problem . as shown in figure  [ fcprop ] , the non - ideal mhd effects increase the mass - to - flux ratio of the first core but only by one order of magnitude .",
    "this is insufficient to explain the difference of magnetization between molecular cloud cores and protostars .",
    "this is partly because we do not consider shielding of cosmic rays ( see also * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the ionization rate in the dense region would largely vary depending on the abundance of radioactive nuclei as discussed in [ srate ] .",
    "possibly , higher non - ideal mhd rates or other mechanisms to accelerate diffusion ( e.g. turbulence ) are required .",
    "if we use higher rates , the disk size will be also larger . or",
    ", we speculate that further redistribution of magnetic fields from the formed protostar will take place in the later phase ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the non - ideal mhd effects play an important role in numerical simulations ; they actually help convergence .",
    "in the ideal mhd approximation , dissipation of magnetic fields is totally determined by resolution . in protostellar collapse simulations ,",
    "the mid - plane is a current sheet where the magnetic fields above and below are anti - parallel . in ideal mhd ,",
    "the current sheet can be extremely thin and convergence is not well defined , at least difficult to achieve .",
    "for example , @xcite reported poor convergence of their ideal mhd simulations with mis - aligned magnetic fields or turbulence ; more than 20 cells per the local jeans length are required for the mis - aligned cases while 15 cells seem to be sufficient for the aligned cases . with the non - ideal mhd effects , on the other hand",
    ", the current sheet has a finite thickness , and therefore convergence is now well defined and can be achieved with a finite resolution",
    ". however , it still requires high resolution to resolve the dissipation scales sufficiently because the dissipation scale is very small due to the small diffusivity in the low density region .",
    "although our simulations include as many physical processes as possible , a possibly important effect missing in this work is the hall effect .",
    "the hall effect is another non - ideal mhd effect which can spin up the gas and help disk formation @xcite . because the rate of the hall effect is as high as the ambipolar diffusion @xcite , it is likely important in star and disk formation processes .",
    "however , it is not easy to implement in high - resolution 3d simulations , especially when we resolve the first core directly where the hall effect works most actively . this is because it requires very small time steps proportional to @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the rate of the hall effect .",
    "the sts acceleration is not effective for the hall effect because of its hyperbolic nature .",
    "moreover , unlike ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion , the hall effect changes the characteristic speeds of the mhd waves ( e.g. whistler waves ) .",
    "therefore , to capture this effect accurately , it is inadequate in principle to use the operator - splitting and sub - cycling techniques for the hall effect , like we did for ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "instead , we have to solve the mhd part and the non - ideal mhd part using the same , very small time steps required by the hall effect , which will be extremely expensive .",
    "finally , it should be noted that there are significant uncertainties in the rates of the non - ideal mhd effects because of large uncertainties in the underlying dust properties as discussed in [ srate ] .",
    "the uncertainties also exist in the dust opacities used in the radiation transfer part .",
    "because these uncertainties have direct impacts on formation and evolution of first cores , the results , especially the disk size , might be easily changed by an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , this work should be considered as a case study based on simple assumptions on the dust properties .",
    "a broad parameter survey is required to clarify the effects of the dust properties such as the structure and size distribution .",
    "it will be important and interesting to solve evolution of dust grains , including both growth and destruction , consistently in parallel with rmhd simulations .",
    "there are many topics on dust left to be explored for the future works .",
    "in order to study the effects of ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion on protostellar collapse and disk formation , we performed 3d nested - grid rmhd simulations .",
    "we simulated only the early phase of star formation before formation of protostellar cores , but we found that significant differences already arose at this point .",
    "we revealed that the non - ideal mhd effects qualitatively change the structure and evolution of the first cores .",
    "especially , ambipolar diffusion expands the diffusive region and strongly suppresses angular momentum transport , resulting in early formation of rotationally supported disks .",
    "the conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "ohmic dissipation works in the high density region and suppresses angular momentum transport . as a result",
    ", a very small rotationally supported disk is formed after the second collapse , essentially in parallel with formation of the protostellar core .",
    "ambipolar diffusion extends the diffusive region to the lower density gas , and suppresses angular momentum transport more effectively .",
    "the first core is already supported by rotation significantly from the beginning , although the thermal pressure is still important .",
    "the formed disks remain small in the early phase of star formation and the rotation profile is not keplerian yet , but they will grow later as gas accretion with larger angular momenta continues .",
    "4 .   the first core disk with ambipolar diffusion acquires sufficiently large mass and angular momentum to become gravitationally unstable and form non - axisymmetric structures . as a result ,",
    "the accretion becomes naturally episodic .",
    "although this is speculative at this point , it is likely that disk fragmentation occurs and a binary / multiple system will be formed later .",
    "because of additional support by rotation , the first core is more massive , longer - lived , and more luminous in the model with ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this increases the probability of first core detections , although it is still rare .",
    "also , the first core can exhibit variability by the gravitational instability with the short time scale on the order of years .",
    "these results can reconcile the observational results and theoretical studies .",
    "in previous hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar collapse without magnetic fields , large rotationally supported disks are formed in the early phase of star formation , but those results are not favored by the observations of very young stellar objects . in ideal mhd simulations , on the other hand , the magnetic braking is so efficient that a circumstellar disk is difficult to form , which is referred as the magnetic braking catastrophe .",
    "our results suggest that the non - ideal mhd effects can resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe in the early phase of star formation even before a protostellar core is formed , and enable formation of a small disk in the early phase .",
    "it is expected that the disk will grow later as larger angular momenta accrete .    in previous studies of disk evolution and planet formation , simplified models of isolated",
    ", already - established protoplanetary disks like the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite have been often used as the initial and boundary conditions . however , our results suggest that a seed of a circumstellar \" disk can be formed in the early phase even before a protostar is formed , it co - evolves with the central protostar , and disk fragmentation can happen while the disk and star are still growing via accretion .",
    "this means that we need to consider more realistic situations in order to understand disk evolution and planet formation . ultimately , we need a consistent scenario of star , disk and planet formation  or stellar system formation",

    "<S> the transport of angular momentum by magnetic fields is a crucial physical process in formation and evolution of stars and disks . because the ionization degree in star forming clouds is extremely low , non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation work strongly during protostellar collapse . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have significant impacts in the early phase of star formation as they redistribute magnetic flux and suppress angular momentum transport by magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we perform three - dimensional nested - grid radiation magnetohydrodynamic ( rmhd ) simulations including ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion . without these effects , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields transport angular momentum so efficiently that no rotationally supported disk is formed even after the second collapse . </S>",
    "<S> ohmic dissipation works only in a relatively high density region within the first core and suppresses angular momentum transport , enabling formation of a very small rotationally supported disk after the second collapse . with both ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion , these effects work effectively in almost the entire region within the first core and significant magnetic flux loss occurs . as a result , a rotationally supported disk is formed even before a protostellar core forms . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the disk is still small , about 5 au at the end of the first core phase , but this disk will grow later as gas accretion continues . </S>",
    "<S> thus the non - ideal mhd effects can resolve the so - called magnetic braking catastrophe while maintaining the disk size small in the early phase , which is implied from recent interferometric observations . </S>"
