    "this paper is based on a talk given at the caltech conference @xcite  nuclear astrophysics 1957 - 2007 : beyond the first 50 years , \" july 23 - 27 , 2007 , which focused on the state of nuclear astrophysics fifty years after the seminal paper of burbidge , burbidge , fowler , and hoyle @xcite . the quest to measure solar neutrinos , and later to resolve the solar neutrino problem , began in the early days of nuclear astrophysics , with the first efforts to understand proton burning in main sequence stars .",
    "i would like to review that history , our current understanding of solar neutrinos , and open questions in neutrino physics , and discuss some opportunities for further solar neutrino measurements .",
    "solar neutrino physics brings together stellar modeling , nuclear reactions , and observation . a key early development was the 1959 holmgren and johnston @xcite measurement of the s - factor for the pp - chain reaction @xmath0he(@xmath1be , which proved to be surprisingly large .",
    "this implied that the sun could produce some of its energy through the more temperature dependent ppii and ppiii cycles of the pp chain , elevating the neutrino fluxes expected from @xmath2be electron capture and @xmath3b @xmath4 decay .",
    "( see fig . 1 . )",
    "these neutrinos contribute to ground- and excited - state transitions in @xmath5cl(@xmath6,e)@xmath5ar , a reaction for detecting neutrinos that had been proposed by pontecorvo @xcite in 1946 and considered by alvarez @xcite in 1949 ( who studied backgrounds that might inhibit , for example , a reactor neutrino experiment ) .",
    "alvarez s envisioned experiment  proposed as a test of the distinguishability of the neutrino and antineutrino , prior to the discovery of parity violation  was later conducted by davis at savannah river @xcite .",
    "the caltech effort in nuclear astrophysics brought three young researchers , bahcall , iben , and sears , together in the summer of 1962 .",
    "stimulated in part by the holmgren and johnston measurement , they began construction of a solar model to predict the solar core temperature , the most important parameter governing the competition between the ppi , ppii , and ppiii cycles , and to provide the first quantitative estimate of the resulting neutrino fluxes .",
    "the bahcall , fowler , iben , and sears model , published in 1963 , predicted a counting rate for davis s proposed 100,000-gallon chlorine solar neutrino detector of about one event per day .",
    "a key development occurred in 1963 when , during a seminar by bahcall at copenhagen , mottelson inquired about the importance of neutrino excitation of excited states in @xmath5ar @xcite . in 1964 bahcall and barnes @xcite pointed out that a calibration of the excited state contribution to the @xmath5cl cross section could be made by measuring the delayed protons from the analog @xmath4 decay of @xmath5ca , the isospin mirror of @xmath5cl . effectively the lifetime of @xmath5ca would be a test of the elevated cross section predicted on the basis of the excited - state contribution to @xmath3b neutrino absorption .",
    "subsequent measurements by hardy and verrall @xcite and reeder , poskanzer , and esterlund @xcite established the importance of the excited - state contribution .",
    "[ these experiments were later repeated in a manner that was kinematically complete : see adelberger et al .",
    "@xcite for a discussion . ]",
    "bahcall @xcite and davis @xcite published companion letters in march 1964 arguing the adequacy and feasibility of a 100,000-gallon cl experiment to measure solar neutrinos .",
    "excavation of the detector cavity in the homestake mine began in summer 1965 .",
    "the tank was installed and filled by the next year .",
    "the first results were announced by davis , harmer , and hoffman @xcite in 1968 , an upper bound of 3 snu ( 1 snu = 10@xmath7 capures / cl atom / sec ) , below the standard solar model ( ssm ) prediction of bahcall , bahcall , and shaviv of 7.5 @xmath8 3 snu @xcite .",
    "this result and associated theoretical work on suggested solutions led to a series of experiments ",
    "gallex / gno / sage @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , and the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite .",
    "efforts by borexino @xcite and kamland @xcite to measure the @xmath2be neutrinos are currently underway or in preparation .",
    "these experiments are important as tests of the ssm and of the new neutrino physics that proved to be the source of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the physics assumptions underlying the ssm include :    * hydrostatic equilibrium . for each volume element it is assumed that gravity is balanced by the gas pressure gradient .",
    "this requires specification of the electron gas equation of state as a function of temperature , heavy element abundance z , and density .",
    "the eos is very nearly that of an ideal gas . * energy transport .",
    "the sun has a radiative interior and convective envelope , with the location of the boundary sensitive to the modeling of the radiative opacity .",
    "the depth of the convective zone can be determined experimentally , because it influences solar surface acoustic modes ( helioseismology ) .",
    "* energy generation .",
    "solar energy is generated by the conversion of four protons to @xmath9he with the release of about 25 mev in energy , with the pp - chain accounting for nearly 99% of the reactions ( and the cno cycle the remainder ) .",
    "the main laboratory task has been determining the nuclear cross sections for the various reactions to sufficient precision . because typical center - of - mass energies in the solar core are @xmath10 2 kev , in general this requires measuring reactions at higher energies , then using r - matrix or other models to extrapolate the laboratory s - factors to threshold . * boundary conditions .",
    "the sun s age and current luminosity , radius , mass , and surface composition are known .",
    "while the composition of the solar core at the onset of the main sequence is not known directly , the ssm assumes that the zero - age core metallicity @xmath11 can be equated to today s surface value . as the mass fractions in h",
    ", he , and heavy elements z must sum to one , a single additional constraint is needed .",
    "this is the solar luminosity : the zero - age h / he ratio is adjusted until the correct luminosity is achieved after 4.6 b.y . of evolution .",
    "the nuclear physics efforts on the pp - chain have reach a very high level of sophistication @xcite .",
    "long the most uncertain rate in the pp - chain , the s - factor for @xmath2be(p,@xmath12 ) has now been determined to an accuracy of @xmath13 5% @xmath14 by a series of six  direct \" measurements @xcite . also notable are the measurements by the luna collaboration , working in the low - background environment of gran sasso , on @xmath0he+@xmath0he .",
    "the group succeeded in obtaining data in the solar gamow peak , thus largely eliminating theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolation of high - energy data to solar energies @xcite .",
    "the ssm has evolved over the years .",
    "for example , the growing accuracy of helioseismology helped motivate efforts to include the diffusion of he and heavy elements over the solar lifetime .",
    "important checks on the ssm include the predicted depth of the convective zone , which is constrained experimentally by the frequency distribution of low-@xmath15 acoustic modes .",
    "the model that emerges is dynamic : there is a @xmath10 44% luminosity growth over the solar lifetime due to changing core chemistry and thus opacity .",
    "the high - energy @xmath3b neutrino flux is a relatively contemporary phenomenon : it is predicted to grow with a time constant @xmath16 b.y . , @xmath17 .",
    "yet the model remains somewhat limited in scope .",
    "as calculations are done in 1d , there is no attempt to model the detailed behavior of the convective zone or of the convective onset of main - sequence burning .",
    "known phenomena such as the depletion of surface li are presumably connected with such physics .",
    "solar neutrinos were initially viewed  and remain  an important test of the ssm .",
    "the three cycles making up the pp - chain ( see fig . 1 ) are tagged by neutrinos ",
    "the pp neutrino flux constrains the overall rate of h burning , while the @xmath2be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes can be used to determine the ppii and ppiii rates , respectively .",
    "because of coulomb barriers , the competition between the three cycles depends rather sensitively on the solar core temperature . thus solar neutrino flux measurements  given the quality of current calibrations of the nuclear microphysics ",
    "can fix the core temperature to an accuracy of about 1% .",
    "but , by the mid-90s , instead of such a temperature determination , an important discrepancy had been confirmed .",
    "the combination of the cl , gallium , and kamioka experiments seemed to require ( assuming otherwise standard physics ) @xmath18 the difficulty posed by these results can be easily seen .",
    "a low @xmath19 naively implies a solar core cooler than predicted by the ssm : due to the @xmath20 dependence of the @xmath3b neutrinos , a core temperature @xmath21 would account for the kamioka and cl results .",
    "however the ssm also predicts that @xmath22 .",
    "thus the low value of this ratio , compared to ssm predictions , requires a hotter core .",
    "while such an analysis based on a single parameter @xmath23 may seem naive , more detail investigations came to the similar conclusions .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2 , from castellani et al . @xcite , shows that a variety of ssm perturbations yield fluxes that corresponding to expectations based on @xmath23 .    .",
    "this naive @xmath23 dependence was recognized early on to be incompatible with the pattern of fluxes deduced from the cl , gallex / sage , and kamioka experiments . from castellani",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has massless neutrinos .",
    "but if extended  treated as an effective theory with a dimension - full majorana mass term ( the only dimension - five operator that can be constructed with sm fields ) or enlarged to include the right - handed neutrino field needed for a dirac mass term  neutrinos would be massive .",
    "massive neutrinos not coincident with their flavor eigenstate counterparts will lead to the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations , as pontecorvo first pointed out .",
    "furthermore , fascinating new oscillation phenomenon can occur because solar neutrinos are created at high density in the solar core , then propagate to low density .",
    "mikheyev and smirnov @xcite showed that the effective mass neutrinos acquire in matter , a phenomenon first discussed by wolfenstein @xcite , could lead to large oscillation probabilities , even for small vacuum mixing angles .",
    "such matter - enhanced neutrino oscillations can be viewed as a level - crossing phenomenon : the local masses of the neutrinos reflect the surrounding electron density , with the electron neutrino becoming heavier at high density .",
    "if the solar core density is sufficient to cause a level inversion , then a level crossing will occur somewhere in the sun , as the neutrino propagates outward @xcite .",
    "if that crossing is adiabatic @xcite , then strong @xmath24 conversion will occur  as illustrated in fig .",
    "details of this process are discussed in many places , and will not be repeated here .    s effective mass increases in matter . in the adiabatic limit",
    ", a neutrino would follow one of the local mass eigenstate trajectories depicted by the solid lines .",
    "a @xmath25 created in the solar core as the heavy mass eigenstate can leave the sun as the vacuum heavy eigenstate which , if the vacuum mixing angle is small , may be nearly coincident with the @xmath26.,width=453 ]    the early solar neutrino results and the possibility of discovering new particle physics provided the impetus for two important direct - counting experiments , super - kamiokande @xcite and the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite .",
    "sno , a cerenkov detector with an inner vessel containing a kiloton of heavy water surrounded by seven kilotons of light water , was unique in its sensitivity to neutrino flavors .",
    "it and super - kamiokande both made use of @xmath27 elastic scattering ( es ) @xmath28 a reaction that takes place for both electron and heavy - flavor neutrinos , with cross sections roughly in a 6:1 ratio .",
    "the scattered electrons are forward peaked , allowing the experimenters to cut away backgrounds by correlating signals with the position of the sun .",
    "but sno also detected two other reactions , the charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) breakup of deuterium , @xmath29 these reactions are sensitive , respectively , just to @xmath25s or equally to neutrinos of any flavor .",
    "the cc reaction was detected via the scattered electron , which tends to carry off most of the neutrino energy ( helpful in reconstructing the neutrino spectrum ) but is emitted almost isotropically ( so there is little directionality that can be exploited to reduce backgrounds ) .",
    "the signal for the nc reaction is the neutron , which was observed in sno by @xmath30 capture on a cl - bearing salt added to the detector and , later , in tubular @xmath0he proportional counters that were installed in the detector .",
    "sno s great depth ( @xmath10 6 km water equivalent ) and clean - room operating standards made such measurements possible , reducing cosmic and environmental radioactivity backgrounds to very low levels .    b neutrino flux.,width=453 ]    the sno results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the bands representing the three neutrino detection channels , with their very different sensitivities to neutrino flavor , converge at an ellipse indicating that approximately two - thirds of the solar neutrinos arrive on earth as heavy - flavor neutrinos .",
    "thus the discrepancy first noted by davis , whose cl detector recorded @xmath25s only , was not due to an incorrect estimate of the solar neutrino flux , but rather to their partial conversion to other flavors during transit to earth .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "4 shows that the ssm prediction for the @xmath3b solar neutrino flux is in good agreement with the flavor - blind nc measurement made in sno .",
    "thus the question , where does the solar neutrino field go from here ?",
    "three important directions are :    * pursuit of several important open questions about neutrino properties , using both accelerator / reactor and astrophysical neutrino sources .",
    "these questions are important to the modeling of a variety of exotic stellar environments , such as core - collapse supernovae , and to the construction of extensions to the sm that will encompass the new neutrino physics . * completing the spectroscopy of pp - chain neutrinos : this includes direct measurements , such as those underway by borexino @xcite and kamland @xcite , of the @xmath2be neutrinos , and future experiments to determine the flux and flavor of the dominant solar neutrino source , the pp neutrinos .",
    "existing constraints on the low - energy fluxes come from the radiochemical cl and gallex / gno / sage detectors . * measuring the cno neutrinos .",
    "i will argue below that such a measurement is not only important to understanding the sun  a cno neutrino measurement would determine directly the solar core metallicity  but also to the general theory of main - sequence evolution of massive stars .",
    "g / cm@xmath0 , typical of the carbon zone of the progenitor of a type ii supernova .",
    "the relevant mixing angle @xmath32 has not yet been measured.,width=453 ]    _ neutrino properties : _ figure 5 illustrates some of the expectations for neutrino physics in stellar environments , assuming a regular ( rather than inverted ) hierarchy where the two neutrino states participating in solar neutrino mixing are lighter than the third state .",
    "the physics discussed in connection with solar neutrinos  the 1 - 2 level crossing arising from matter effects  is repeated at higher density , in a second crossing .",
    "the atmospheric @xmath33 ev@xmath34 leads to the expectation that for neutrino energies typical of a supernova ( @xmath10 10 mev ) , this crossing would be encountered in the carbon zone of a massive star , where @xmath35 g / cm@xmath0 .",
    "however , the relevant mixing angle @xmath32 is not known : the current upper bound from the chooz reactor experiment is @xmath36 ( at @xmath37 = 2.0 @xmath38 ev ) @xcite .",
    "this crossing ( as well as additional neutrino background effects discussed by george fuller at this meeting ) has the potential to alter energy deposition in a supernova , by causing the exchange of cooler electron neutrinos and hotter heavy - flavor neutrinos .",
    "hotter @xmath25s increase the neutrino - matter coupling .",
    "such an inversion could produce distinctive signatures in terrestrial detectors with sensitivities to different neutrino flavors . as the crossing is expected to remain adiabatic for mixing angles @xmath39",
    ", this signature could prove very important if @xmath40 , the level that proposed experiments such as double chooz @xcite and daya bay @xcite are expected to reach .",
    "prior to construction of a neutrino factory , terrestrial experiments may not be able to reach much beyond the 0.01 level .",
    "figure 6 illustrates some of remaining questions related to masses .",
    "we know the solar neutrino mass - squared difference @xmath41 . in the case of atmospheric neutrinos , the magnitude , but not the sign , of @xmath42 is known .",
    "thus two hierarchies  normal and inverted  are allowed by the data .",
    "the absolute scale of neutrino masses  the offset from zero shown in fig .",
    "6  is limited by laboratory experiments ( tritium @xmath4 decay ) to @xmath43 ev @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the neutrino mass under particle - antiparticle conjugation is not known : extensions of the sm would allow both dirac and lepton - number - violating majorana terms , and indeed the presence of both is exploited in the seesaw mechanism to explain the smallness of neutrino mass relative to other sm fermions , @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a typical sm dirac mass and @xmath46 a heavy right - handed neutrino mass . that is , @xmath47 is suppressed relative to other sm masses by the small parameter @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , an @xmath49 , near the gut scale , is suggested by the identification of @xmath50 ev .",
    "progress will be made on each of these questions in the next decade .",
    "next - generation long - baseline neutrino experiments have , as one of their goals , the use of matter effects to distinguish between the normal and inverted hierarchies @xcite .",
    "the new tritium @xmath4 decay experiment katrin has the potential to tighten the limit on @xmath51 , and thus the absolute scale of neutrino mass , by almost an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "similarly , cosmological analyses that calculate the effects of massive neutrinos on large - scale structure , as deduced from galaxy surveys and from temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , place a constraint on the neutrino mass contribution to the closure density .",
    "currently this yields @xmath52 though this limit is expected to tighten significantly when planck and other future cmb observatories produce data .",
    "several next - generation neutrinoless double @xmath4 decay experiments are under development , with the ultimate goal of reaching majorana mass sensitives of @xmath53 the scale we noted was set by @xmath54 .",
    "here the sum extends over neutrino generations , with each neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath55 contributing in proportion to its mass and to its coupling probability to the electron @xmath56 .",
    "each term is weighted by a phase @xmath57 that , if cp is conserved , corresponds to @xmath58 : thus mass eigenstates will tend to cancel in this sum if they have opposite cp . if cp is violated , the @xmath57 also include the effects of two majorana phases that will be difficult to constrain by other means .",
    "double beta decay is our most powerful probe of lepton number violation and majorana masses , and has potentially the most reach as a laboratory test of neutrino mass .",
    "it can distinguish among competing neutrino mass scenarios , e.g. , quasi - degenerate schemes vs. schemes where the electron neutrino is quite light , though the mass defined by eq .",
    "( [ bb ] ) is not simply related to the kinematic mass measured in experiments like tritium @xmath4 decay .    denoting the mass eigenstates by @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the relationship between the mass and flavor eigenstates is a product of rotations in the 2 - 3 ( atmospheric neutrino ) , 1 - 3 ( reactor @xmath61 disappearance ) , and 1 - 2 ( solar neutrino ) subspaces . defining the respective angles by @xmath62 , @xmath32 , and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 ,",
    "the mixing matrix is @xmath66 this matrix includes three cp - violating phases , the dirac phase @xmath67 and two majorana phases @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments have determined @xmath70 and @xmath71 and , while greater accuracy is always important ( especially to determine how close @xmath62 might be to the maximal mixing limit of @xmath72 ) , most attention is now focused on determining the unknown parameters in the mixing matrix .",
    "perhaps most important is the third mixing angle @xmath32 , which , as noted earlier , is so far only bounded by reactor neutrino results .",
    "new reactor experiments currently in preparation , double chooz and daya bay , are designed to reach sensitivities of approximately 0.02 and 0.008 , respectively .",
    "given that the source of cp violation responsible for the excess of matter over antimatter in our universe is still uncertain , the determination of the scale of leptonic cp violation is also a major goal . with suitable attention to matter effects associated with neutrino beams passing through the earth and to other parameter degeneracies @xcite , cp violation can be determined in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments that compare @xmath73 $ ] with @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the cp violation is proportional to the jarlskog invariant @xmath75 the first two factors are known to be large .",
    "thus a demonstration that @xmath32 is not too small would imply significant sensitivity to cp violation .",
    "probing such cp violation is one of the major goals for very long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , where the relative size of the cp - violating observable grows with distance @xcite .",
    "+ _ low - energy neutrino spectroscopy : _ pending results from borexino and kamland on their efforts to measure @xmath2be neutrinos , direct real - time measurements are so far limited to the @xmath3b @xmath6 spectrum above 5 mev .",
    "thus 99.99% of the flux has not been detected by direct means , including the pp / pep and @xmath2be neutrinos that tag the ppi and ppii cycles ( see fig .",
    "7 , taken from bahcall @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillation parameters deduced from global fits to solar neutrino data indicate that the solar @xmath25 spectrum will be distorted by matter effects .",
    "yet so far there has been no direct measurement of the energy dependence in the survival probability @xmath76 or of msw day - night effects due to neutrino passage through the earth .",
    "the oscillation parameters indicate that the level - crossing boundary of the 1 - 2 msw triangle will be encountered at a neutrino energy of @xmath10 3 mev .",
    "thus one can explore the transition from vacuum oscillations to matter oscillations by mapping @xmath76 from low to high neutrino energies .",
    "borexino , now operating , will determine @xmath77 , for example .    a variety of cc and nc pp - neutrino detectors are under development .",
    "in addition to the exploration of matter effects , these detectors will be able to exploit nature s most intense and well - characterized source of @xmath25s : the solar pp flux and spectrum are known to an accuracy of about 1% . while experiments like kamland have succeeded in reducing uncertainties on @xmath78 by measuring @xmath79 at different baselines , uncertainties in the reactor @xmath80 spectrum limit the accuracy of @xmath63 determinations .",
    "but solar pp - neutrino measurements could , in principle , determine this angle to @xmath10 1% . + _ testing stellar modeling : the cno neutrinos : _ despite the minor role cno neutrinos play in our sun , there is strong motivation for exploiting these neutrinos as a quantitative test of our understanding of the cno cycle :    * the cno cycle , due to its sharper dependence on stellar core temperature , is the reaction chain that sustains massive main - sequence stellar evolution .",
    "this dependence is reflected in the corresponding neutrino fluxes , which vary as @xmath81 .",
    "because sno and super - kamiokande have made accurate measurements of the most temperature - dependent component of the pp - chain ( @xmath82 ) , we know the core temperature in our sun to an accuracy of about 1% . thus we can now use the solar core as a calibrated laboratory in which to test our understanding of the cno cycle . *",
    "the cno cycle is important to other systems of current interest , such as the first massive metal - poor stars ( where hydrogen burning via the cno cycle turns on only after an early phase of @xmath83c produces metals ) .",
    "* one of the principal assumptions of the ssm is the identification of today s surface metal abundances with the zero - age core metallicity .",
    "a measurement of cno neutrinos is a direct check on this assumption , as the flux is proportional to core metallicity .",
    "* this issue  using surface observations to constrain the core  is now central to the principal anomaly in the ssm , that new surface metal determinations have placed helioseismology results ( e.g. , deduced sound speeds , estimates of the depth of the convective zone ) in conflict with ssm predictions @xcite . * the cno cycle",
    "is thought to be responsible for an early convective stage in our sun , extending about 10@xmath3 years , driven by out - of - equilibrium burning .",
    "current efforts to build 2d/3d extensions of the ssm are an important step toward modeling the early sun .",
    "thus one would like to verify that equilibrium cno - burning is understood , to establish a foundation for later studies of solar convection and out - of - equilibrium burning .",
    "* the nuclear physics of the cno cycle has been put on much firmer ground due to recent measurements of the controlling cross section .",
    "be , and cno neutrinos in sno+ .",
    "figure from m. chen @xcite.,width=453 ]    the sharp @xmath23-dependence of cno hydrogen burning is important to the stability of massive stars .",
    "while a minor contributor to ssm energy production ( @xmath10 1% ) , the cno cycle does produce measurable solar neutrino fluxes @xcite @xmath84 to predict the response of terrestrial detectors to these sources one needs @xmath23 ( calibrated in the @xmath3b flux measurements by sno and super - kamiokande ) , the oscillation parameters @xmath78 and @xmath63 , and the nuclear cross sections for the cno cycle .",
    "recent progress has also been made on nuclear physics : new measurements by the luna collaboration @xcite and at tunl @xcite have reduced uncertainties in the rate - controlling @xmath85n(p,@xmath12 ) cross section .",
    "luna measured the s - factor down to 70 kev , finding a result that is 50% smaller than the previous  best value . \"",
    "this revision has had a significant impact on stellar age determinations , pushing back globular cluster ages by an estimated 0.7 - 1.0 b.y .",
    "there is a new idea for building a high - counting - rate detector sensitive to cno neutrinos , construction of a large - volume scintillation detector in the cavity previously occupied by sno .",
    "the new detector , sno+ @xcite , if developed for solar neutrinos ( in addition to double beta decay ) , would be able to detect about 2300 cno neutrinos / year / kton , above a threshold of about 0.8 mev , as shown in fig .",
    "it would appear that a flux measurement accurate to @xmath10 10% might be possible .",
    "the combination of a practical experiment , more certain nuclear physics , a calibrated solar core temperature , and known neutrino parameters @xmath86 and @xmath63 appear to make a direct measurement of core metallicity possible .",
    "the new surface abundances that have been derived from improved 3d atmospheric solar absorption line analyses are difficult to dismiss , despite the tension they have generated between the ssm ( and its neutrino predictions ) and helioseismology .",
    "the new abundances generally bring the sun into better accord with galactic composition trends @xcite .",
    "it may turn out that the ssm assumption that equates surface and zero - age core metallicity is unjustified  that some evolutionary effect breaks this equivalence . in any case , the opportunity to test this assumption experimentally should be taken .",
    "neutrino astrophysics and the theories of the origin of the elements , the main theme of this conference , share a common history .",
    "laboratory astrophysics has made solar neutrino physics into a quantitative field , and allowed experimenters to anticipate the kinds of major discoveries that justified experiments like sno and super - kamiokande .",
    "the results  discovery of neutrino mass and flavor mixing characterized by large angles  are of great importance , providing our first constraints on physics beyond the sm of particle physics .",
    "but as summarized here , the list of remaining laboratory neutrino physics questions is long .",
    "the answers to the open questions will be important in helping us characterize extreme astrophysical and cosmological neutrino environments .",
    "the needed 20-year program of laboratory and astrophysical neutrino studies is not unlike the laboratory / astrophysics interface that willie fowler cultivated to help us understand the origin of the elements .",
    "despite the current focus on particle physics properties of neutrinos , solar neutrino spectroscopy remains an important probe of the ssm and stellar evolution .",
    "the arguments for measuring the cno flux , using our sun as a calibrated laboratory , seem particularly strong .",
    "such a program would effectively test our understanding of the hydrogen burning mechanism for massive main - sequence stars .",
