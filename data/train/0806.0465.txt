    "recently , two - component fermion systems with population imbalance have attracted much attention in various research fields , such as cold atoms , superconductors , and qcd @xcite . in the 1960 s",
    ", effects of the population imbalance have been theoretically investigated in the superconductivity literature @xcite .",
    "sarma considered the stability of the gap phase ( sarma state ) @xcite and liu and wilczek revisited it with a new picture ( interior gap phase ) @xcite .",
    "fulde and ferrell @xcite , and larkin and ovchinikov @xcite predicted the so - called fflo state , where the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated .",
    "very recently , some evidence of the fflo state has been reported in a heavy fermion superconductor @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the population imbalance has been also extensively studied in ultra - cold fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using atom gases is that one can widely tune some physical parameters , such as the interaction and the population imbalance . in a trapped two - component @xmath1 fermi gas @xcite , a phase separation between a superfluid core region and a surrounding unpaired gas of excess atoms was observed .",
    "recently , the absence of the population imbalance inside the superfluid core region was reported in @xcite .",
    "so far , the superfluid fermi gas with population imbalance has been experimentally studied without an optical lattice @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate effects of the lattice @xcite on the population imbalanced systems .",
    "very recently , there have been several reports on this issue , one of which theoretically claims that fflo is more stabilized than the non - optical lattice case @xcite , and others of which numerically show that fflo is observable in the one - dimensional attractive hubbard model @xcite by using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite .",
    "our approach in this paper differs from these works in using the exact diagonalization method mainly and the dmrg method @xcite complementarily in order to check whether the exact diagonalization results are small size effects or not .",
    "in addition , we focus on the density profile of majority ( @xmath2 ) and minority components ( @xmath3 ) at @xmath4 in a one- and two - dimensional lattice trapped systems instead of the stability of the exotic superfluidity fflo .",
    "the reason is that the atom density profile is the most convenient and clear observable for experiments .",
    "moreover , the fflo requires at least the population imbalance in the atom density profile .",
    "namely , it is crucial point for fflo whether the population imbalance survives even in the presence of pair instability at @xmath4 ground state or not .",
    "thus , we widely measure the atom density profiles in various system sizes , imbalance , interaction , dimensionality ( 1d-2d ) , and traps , prior to an examination of the fflo stability .",
    "consequently , we point out in a strongly - attractive interaction regime that correlation effects due to the presence of lattice result in a core phase with a typical population imbalance , which is very different from non - lattice cases @xcite .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in section [ pdp ] ,",
    "we summarize the experimental results of the atom density profiles in the imbalanced fermi gases without the optical lattice and show our prediction on those of the imbalanced gases in the presence of the optical lattice .",
    "section [ mncm ] is devoted to explain the model and the numerical method . in section [ nr1d ] , numerical results by the exact diagonalization and dmrg",
    "are presented , theoretical analysis using an effective model derived in strong coupling limit is given , and strong trap effects are displayed as an exceptional case .",
    "section [ nr2d ] shows the results in two dimensional ( 2-d ) systems , and section [ tempe ] discusses temperature effects on all the present results .",
    "finally , summary and conclusion are given .",
    "schematic profiles of the total atom density and the density difference between particles with pseudo - spin up and down , i.e. , @xmath5 , which are measured along the long axis of the trap for polarized fermionic gases .",
    "the upper panels ( a ) and ( b ) display the experimental ( non - lattice system ) results , while the lower panels ( c ) and ( d ) predict the profiles in the presence of the optical lattice .",
    "the parabolic lines schematically represent the trap potential shape . in the absence of the optical lattice",
    ", the experiments revealed that the phase separation between the paired ( superfluid ) gas and the completely polarized ( excess major atoms only ) periphery occurs as shown in the upper panels ( a ) and ( b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower panels ( c ) and ( d ) show a typical result of numerical calculations in the presence of the optical lattice .",
    "a big difference between the upper and the lower panels is that the excess species can stay even on the superfluid core in the presence of the optical lattice . ]    in this section , we summarize the experimental results @xcite of the trapped imbalanced fermi gases without the optical lattice and predict how their results change by adding the optical lattice .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are schematic pictures of atomic density profiles obtained in experiments without the optical lattice , and ( c ) and ( d ) are our prediction of those in the presence of the optical lattice . at first , let us focus on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the experiments revealed that the polarized gases show a phase separation between the core and the periphery below the superfluid transition temperature .",
    "the phase separation picture was clearly confirmed by monitoring the atom density profile for each of two fermi - atom species . inside the core",
    ", the profile shows an atom density ratio , @xmath6 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) @xcite , while a completely - polarized phase appears in the periphery , where the atom density ratio , @xmath7 in a case that the majority species is fermi atom with the pseudo - spin @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , our calculations in the presence of the optical lattice reveal that although the phase separation occurs like the experimental results without the optical lattice , the atom density profile shows a big difference compared to the non - lattice cases .",
    "we find in the presence of lattice that the population imbalance generally remains even in the superfluid core region , i.e. , the atom density ratio inside the core , @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we find in sufficiently strong pairing - interaction that @xmath10 @xcite inside the core as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) .",
    "this result is compared with an effective model theoretically derived in the strong limit of the attractive interaction . in this paper",
    ", we claim that correlation effects on the lattice bring about the imbalanced core phase .",
    "the main correlation effects on the lattice originate from a repulsive interaction between two cooper pairs @xcite and a site - exchange energy gain between a cooper pair and an excess fermion as shown in [ nr1d ] .",
    "the effective model successfully explains why the imbalanced core emerges .",
    "let us show the model hamiltonian and the numerical calculation method to obtain the ground state of the model . in this paper , we consider two - component trapped fermi gases inside optical lattices with @xmath11 lattice sites .",
    "when the optical lattice potential is sufficiently strong , the system can be well described by the hubbard model , the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) hamiltonian of which is given as @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the creation operator of a fermi particle with pseudo - spin @xmath14 or @xmath15 at @xmath16-th site , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is a pairing interaction .",
    "the summation @xmath19 is taken over the nearest - neighbor sites , and the hopping matrix element @xmath20 describes the hopping energy of atoms between the nearest - neighbor sites . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) gives a harmonic trap potential , in which @xmath21 corresponds to the potential height at the edge of the lattice . at the edge",
    ", the open - boundary condition is imposed .",
    "if the atomic density profile drops down at the edge , then the boundary condition does not almost affect the result .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 and the total number of fermi atoms @xmath22 are selected to sufficiently reduce the atom density at the edges .    in this paper , we examine various population imbalances with keeping @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the total number of fermi atoms with pseudo - spin @xmath8 and @xmath15 , respectively . in 1-d cases , we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) to calculate the density profile at @xmath4 .",
    "although this approach gives us exact results , the accessible system size is severely limited . to compensate this disadvantage and confirm whether the exact diagonalization results are small size effects or not",
    ", we employ the dmrg method .",
    "the dmrg guarantees a high accurate result as long as the trap potential is not so steep .",
    "we confirm that a difference between the eigen - values obtained by both methods is below @xmath27 in the lattice size @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "since the dmrg is mainly used for much less steep traps ( @xmath30 is fixed to be 1 except for section vi d , which examines a trap strength dependence ) , the dmrg results sufficiently keep high accuracy .    on the other hand , in two - dimensional ( 2-d ) square lattice systems ,",
    "we use the exact diagonalization solely , because the method is now the most accurate and reliable for 2-d finite systems . here",
    ", we just mention that the direct extension of the dmrg to 2-d ladder cases , which keeps high accuracy like 1-d cases is now under development @xcite . for the exact diagonalization and the dmrg , we use sx-6 ( 1-node 4 cpu s system ) and altix 3700bx2 ( scalar parallel machine ) in jaea and the earth simulator @xcite . in the exact diagonalization ,",
    "the problems with the lattice size @xmath31 are calculated by sx-6 , while those with above @xmath28 the earth simulator . in the latter case",

    "let us present exact diagonalization results for the imbalanced 1-d attractive hubbard model with the trap potential .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows @xmath32 dependences of the calculated atom - density profile of the ground state , @xmath33 for three population imbalances , whose ratios of major to minor species are ( a ) 5:3 , ( b ) 6:2 , and ( c ) 7:1 , respectively . for these three cases , the lattice size @xmath31 , the total number of fermions @xmath34 , and @xmath29 .",

    "this function is a probe for the local condensate amplitude @xcite for finite systems . here",
    ", we note that the probe gives non - zero values even at the interaction free @xmath51 as seen in [ fig3 ] ( d ) and shows spatial modulations without sign changes especially in a relatively - weak interaction regime .",
    "the reason for the former one is that the function counts all the possible pair formation probabilities on a local site , i.e. , it includes even the pair formation due to the trap potential , and that for the latter one may be that the strong confinement effect masks the sign change due to the fflo .",
    "although this latter interpretation requires further examinations , we confirm at least the growth of the local condensate amplitude .",
    "see ref.@xcite for the spatial pair correlation in larger core phases . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are calculated by picking up the coefficient of the eigen - state whose @xmath16-th site occupation is 1 and 2 , respectively , from the ground state wave - function and summing up the amplitude of the coefficients .",

    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , as @xmath54 increases in the balanced case , @xmath44 decreases , while @xmath55 instead increases .",
    "this simple relationship means that the cooper pair becomes more tightly - bounded one on a site with increasing @xmath54 .    from fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] while they completely diminish outside the boundary ( shell region ) @xcite .",
    "this tendency becomes more pronounced with increasing the attractive interaction and somewhat saturated in the strong limit .",
    "this suggests that the pair density and the superfluid order ( phase rigidity ) locally develop inside the core .",
    "this does not contradict a consensus that the superfluid correlation grows as the most dominant one in 1-d attractive hubbard model @xcite although any correlations algebraically decay in 1-d systems .",
    "thus , we call the core region `` superfluid core '' in the following",
    ". however , we note that there is a subtle issue whether the whole core really exhibits superfluidity in non - zero temperature due to its dimensionality and finiteness or not .",
    "the discussion originates from a problem whether the phase rigidity grows and survives from an edge of core to another edge against fluctuations .",
    "this is beyond information obtained by the present analysis of the exact diagonalization and dmrg .",
    "thus , we do not discuss the stability of the superfluidity but concentrate only on atom density profiles in the ground state in this paper .",
