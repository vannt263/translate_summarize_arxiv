    "advances in ultrathin - film fabrication techniques have made possible , only quite recently , the construction of thin magnetic transition metal layers , separated by very thin non - magnetic layers ( spacers ) , forming superlattices or sandwiches .",
    "the multilayer system fe / cr / fe has played a fundamental role because the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) was first discovered on it @xcite .",
    "control of the spacer thickness with great accuracy , keeping constant the width of the magnetic layers , has been the main preoccupation of experimentalists for a long time , because this factor is one of the basic conditions for obtaining great values of gmr as well as the coupling constant between the magnetic layers , but the variation of the magnetic layer thickness and its influence on gmr had remained without experimental measurements until quite recently @xcite .",
    "this fact is understandable because most of these experiments were guided by the so far existing models in either the quantum - well @xcite ( qw ) or the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) picture @xcite .",
    "these models study the oscillatory exchange coupling of the magnetic layers , mediated by the electrons in the spacer , as a function of the spacer thickness and remaining the ferromagnetic layer thickness constant in most of the studied layered structures .",
    "however , in this work we focus our attention on the gmr effect produced by the variation of the magnetic layer thickness and surprisingly we have found an oscillating magnetic behavior of the magnetic layers",
    ". the explanation resides more in the presence of qw states than invoking the rkky - like models , as we will see below .",
    "nowadays , it is well known that the interface between layers plays a dominant role in the gmr and obviously it depends strongly on the materials of the sample @xcite . however , the controversy about whether gmr originates from bulk or interface scattering is still open @xcite .",
    "this article will threw some light on this controversy because we calculate the contribution to gmr coming from the bulk and the interface layers .",
    "moreover , we will show that the magnetic properties change as a function of the ferromagnetic layer thickness ( flt ) and the contribution to the gmr effect of this system is not negligible as we will prove using the boltzmann model where the potentials are calculated from the _ ab initio _ data .",
    "thus , we obtain the density of states ( dos ) and energy bands for different flt and through them we can calculate the potentials .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the former potentials are numerically close to those reported by hood and falicov @xcite which were chosen without an explicit justification .",
    "thanks to considering the full electronic structure of these materials , we are able to obtain directly the magnetoresistance of these fe / cr / fe samples in a good agreement with the experiment , at least for a certain interval of the ferromagnetic layer thickness @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that our _ ab initio _ calculations and the interpretation through boltzmann formalism can give us information about some confusion areas where the mesoscopic concepts play a fundamental role such as in the case of the interface . for systems of reduced dimensions ( in this article corresponds to a number of iron monolayers ( ml ) less than four ) the physical magnitudes such as the magnetic moments , conductivity or even the spin change drastically their behavior , having striking consequences for the magnetoresistance effect like for example a considerable enhancement of the gmr ratio .    in the present article",
    ", we investigate the gmr for the layer potentials of fe / cr / fe trilayers determined by means of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations as a function of the thickness of the fe layer .",
    "our study is also restricted to the case of current in plane geometry ( cip ) .",
    "although the study of gmr versus the spacer thickness is well described in literature , only a few articles are devoted to the case of a variable ferromagnetic layer . nevertheless , we have found that the study of this case is more suitable for investigating the intrinsic origen of gmr . in order to show and explain our results we have organized the article as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec0 ] we present the method of calculation .",
    "the fe / cr / fe trilayer system is described and the physical origin of the layer potentials is determined according to the dft calculations .",
    "likewise , a brief description of the effective electron masses is presented in the next subsection .",
    "after that , the transport model is introduced in such a way which allows us to use the data based on dft calculations , in particular , for the relaxation time and the effective mass .",
    "the method is developed in order to describe the electronic transport of the fe / cr / fe trilayers in analogy to the evolution of the co / cu multilayer conductivity @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the results of our calculations are discussed and the predictions for gmr properties are reported .",
    "[ sec3 ] includes some remarks and a brief summary of the article .",
    "thus , the aim of the present article is to describe gmr properties by means of the data obtained within dft method and applied to the fuchs - sondheimer formalism extended for trilayers .",
    "_ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory in the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was used in the form of vosko , wilk , and nusair @xcite . as it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of lsda instead of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in fe / cr trilayers is adequate because gga improves only the geometry optimization , while the energy calculations ( in particular , fermi energy ) are more or less the same .",
    "since we use a fixed geometry and the transport properties depend only on the fermi energy , it is not necessary at all to use the gga .",
    "the kohn - sham equations @xcite were solved using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method in slab geometry @xcite . this method is extremely advantageous for computing the electronic structure of magnetic multilayers , because it was designed to take into account the slab geometry and the interaction between the outermost monolayers of the trilayer system and vacuum .",
    "thus , our method guarantees that all trilayer systems investigated in this work are two - dimensional translational invariants . to our best knowledge , this is the first attempt to account specifically for the slab geometry of layers in contrast with other methodologies where the two - dimensional invariance is achieved by inserting vacuum layers to separate the interaction between the slabs @xcite .",
    "the valence states were calculated in a scalar - relativistic approximation .",
    "a grid of 15 * k*-points in an irreducible wedge of the 2d bz was used during self - consistent field ( scf ) cycles and , once converged , a mesh of 45 * k*-points was considered to evaluate the final energy .",
    "inside the muffin - tin spheres , basis functions with angular momentum components from 1 up to 8 were included .",
    "the charge density and potential within the muffin - tin spheres were expanded into the lattice harmonics with angular momentum from 1 up to 6 .",
    "more than 60 augmented plane waves per atom were used for the variational basis set .",
    "calculations were carried out for the slab consisting of 3 monolayers of cr(001 ) and a variable number of fe monolayers ( 1@xmath3@xmath0@xmath38 ) , where @xmath0 is the number of fe monolayers .",
    "the fe layers are intrinsically ferromagnetic and the cr layers are intrinsically antiferromagnetic ( see column 4 of tables  [ table1 ] and  [ table2 ] ) . figure [ fig:1 ] shows the schematic picture of 3 ml cr in between 5 ml fe for the bcc crystal orientation ( 001 ) .",

    "it is well known that the magnetic properties , dos , and energy bands depend strongly upon the atomic structures of the thin films .",
    "therefore it is necessary to begin with an optimized structure for fe@xmath4/cr@xmath5 system .",
    "nevertheless , no further attempt was made to relax the lattice parameter , i.e. the lattice constant for fe and cr was assumed to be cr bcc bulk - like , that is , a@xmath6=2.88   because we observed small differences in the obtained results when these constants were taken differently",
    ".      the single band model representation leads to the energies @xmath7 of electrons moving in the intrinsic potential @xmath8 with the spin @xmath9 in monolayer @xmath10 and velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the intrinsic potentials require for these calculations to be determined on the basis of _ ab initio _ dft calculations described in sec .",
    "since these values are the electron energies corresponding to the bottom of conductivity band , they were taken to be equal to the energies of @xmath12-electrons in the @xmath13-point of 2d bz , since we assume that these electrons have the main contribution to the conductivity . to describe the spin - dependent conductivity within our model , these energies were split by the value @xmath14 which is equal to the energy splitting of majority and minority - spin d - bands in fe layers while in cr layers the potential values were taken the same for both spin directions .",
    "thus , @xmath15 where @xmath16 for fe slab and @xmath17 for cr slab . note that the spin electron in bohr magneton units is @xmath18 for majority electrons and @xmath19 for minority electrons and the confinement of electrons within two - dimensional slab results in quantization of electron states in the direction perpendicular to the plane of this slab ( z - direction ) .",
    "this quantum - size effect is essential , especially when the slab thickness is restricted to several atomic layers @xcite .",
    "therefore , we took it into account in our present calculations when the thickness of fe film was equal to one- , two- or three atomic layers .    since the quantum - well electronic states , in the case of ultrathin fe films , are well localized in single atomic layer , we assume that the physical properties on this layer are determined mainly by the states which have the degree of localization in the layer more than @xmath20 .",

    "the electron states are more delocalized and they can not be related to only one atomic layer , therefore we took in these cases the values of potentials @xmath23 common for a whole fe film .",
    "the potential values in cr film had always the same value for all cr atomic layers .",

    "these states can result in the onset of a big magnetic moment in the interface fe layer as it takes place also at the surface .",
    "however , the localization of these states near the interface means that they should not be affected by the thickness of fe film and the magnetic moments near fe / cr interface should be independent of fe film thickness .",
    "this is a feature that in our opinion , is due to the qw states , which are delocalized throughout the slab and their energy changes together with increase of the fe film thickness @xcite .",

    "[ sec:3b ] .",
    "for @xmath68 we have a special behavior on the fe / cr interface ( see table  [ table2 ] ) , which deserves a more detailed comment . the first characteristic that we obtain , different from what happens for @xmath69 ,",
    "is that we observe that the majority spins are the main contribution at the fermi level ( see fig .",

    "notice that the dos(@xmath70 ) minority spin for @xmath69 has the corresponding values 3.76 , 0.64 , 0.44 , 0.53 , 0.47 , and 0.71 , while for @xmath68 they are 0.21 and 0.14 , respectively .",
    "as can be inferred , these values are much lower than the previous ones ( in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) , we can see clearly the criterion employed to consider the magnetic channels to be insignificant for @xmath68 , where the dash dot line is the border line between negligible and appreciable channels ) .",
    "in fact , the lowest value for n=1,2,3,4,6 and 8 is 0.44 , which is above the dash dot line .",
    "thus , we observe that the minority spin channels are very small for these two special cases in comparison with the ones seen above . the above comments lead us to conclude that our electronic structure calculations within dos column graphs presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] show that there is essentially only one magnetic channel ( semimetallic ) on the iron - chromium interface for @xmath68 ( see fig.[fig:5](a)-(b ) and table  [ table2 ] ) and a very high increase of the magnetism on its interfaces , since the other channel is the one of the minority spin density , quasiequal to zero .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath71 , and 8 we obtain both kinds of magnetic polarizations : up and down ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this situation is very interesting for the gmr effect if we accept that this phenomenon is mainly due to the scattering of the electrons on these interfaces ( a feature which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3b ] ) , that is , the spin - polarized electrons on the one hand , enhance their velocity when they find the magnetic polarizability of the impurity parallel to the magnetic layer , but on the other hand , the spin - polarized electrons diminish their velocity when they find the polarizability in opposite direction .",
    "therefore , we have a spin valve effect in which there is a selection of one of the two possible magnetic channels , and this drives a decrease or an increase of the conductivity , depending on whether the electrons are parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic polarization of the interface .",

    "the value of this potential is usually taken as a constant however for ultrathin films the potential depends on the thickness of the sample as it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and consequently , the electronic transport is influenced by the thickness of the sample ( not only the thickness of the spacer but also the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer ) .",
    "contrary to the usual procedure described in literature , in this article , the values of the potentials as a function of the flt were determined using the dft methods described earlier ( see fig .",

    "[ fig:6 ] , although the oscillations appear at wrong periodicity compared with the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the light of the present calculations",
    ", we can conclude that the oscillatory character of the gmr comes mainly from a variable potential distribution through out the thin film , since that the oscillatory behavior of the gmr is hidden as long as the potential is allowed to be constant , like for example in the case of the semiclassical model in which every layer is represented by a quantum well with a constant potential @xcite . the mr ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] exhibits two maxima : the first one at around 4    and the second one close to the 8   .",

    "it is a well known fact that at the interface there exists a significant change of the potential but this change is not of the abrupt character . at the interface",
    "there is a transition region where the interdiffusion and the spin mixing take place while the change of the potential should be continuous according to the background .",
    "plot of the calculated ( solid line ) and experimental @xcite ( dashed lines ) mr ratio as a function of the ferromagnetic layer thickness.,width=302 ]    we note that even though on one hand the gmr effect depends strongly on the temperature @xcite and on another hand we are comparing our data ( 0 k ) with the ones reported by okuno",

    "for the sake of comparison with the results reported by okuno _",
    ", it is noteworthy that a remarkable message from our results is the low - dependence behavior of gmr with the number of fe / cr layers because the average value of the gmr ratio in function of the fe layer thickness is around 0.1 for @xmath75 in our calculations and in the experimental results . in order to explain this low - dependence behavior ,",
    "our proposal consists in considering a quasi - linear dependence of resistance of different number of fe / cr layers .",
    "thus , after calculating the gmr ratio , the proportional constant is divided by itself having no appreciable effect in gmr .",
    "this tendency disappears for the case of two or three iron monolayers leading to a considerable gmr ratio as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , since that the electron states are more localized and thus , they favor an increase of the layer potentials .",

    "many possible complications arise in these types of artificial material , among them , interfacial interdiffusion at various lateral length scales , @xcite bulk defects , structural changes as a function of an individual layer and overall thicknesses , different length scales affecting the structure , the boundary conditions on the outermost layers and differences in the magnetotransport along the different directions in the superlattices .",
    "but the key point in the mechanism of gmr is the relative importance of bulk and interfacial scattering .",

    "the square and the inverted - triangle for n=4 ) , the influence of the bulk monolayers become more important . likewise , in this anomalous case , the reduced contribution of the interface scattering favors a diminishment of the total mr , that is reflected in fig .",

    "[ fig:7 ] and our earlier conclusion that the interface should be treated physically not as an ideal plane but as a transition zone between different materials where we can observe a mixture of two compounds ( interdiffusion ) and where not only a significant change of the potential but also a different kind of magnetism take place @xcite .",

    "this fact finds its reflection in a significant change of the potential at interface for different spin polarizations ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the difference in interface potential constitutes the main physical reason of different scattering of electrons with different spin orientation and it is the main mechanism responsible for gmr in multilayers .",
    "we have shown that using the two combined methods : the _ ab initio _ methodology for the accurate calculation of the potentials and the semiclassical approach based on the fuchs - sondheimer formalism , we obtain the gmr values for the trilayer fe / cr / fe system which oscillates versus the thickness of the ferromagnetic layers . in literature , the gmr oscillations versus the nonmagnetic spacer are emphasized while the role of ferromagnetic layer is considered sporadically . in ordinary semiclassical approach",
    "the oscillations of this kind do not exist , however our calculations can predict this oscillatory behavior for ultrathin layers .",
