    "<S> in this work we present preliminary results concerning the properties of about 50 clusters and associations located in a densely populated region at the southern edge of the supershell lmc  4 . </S>",
    "<S> the ages of the clusters and associations are derived . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster formation rate peaks at about 10 - 20 myr ago corresponding to the age of the formation of lmc  4 . </S>",
    "<S> objects younger than 10 myr are located close to co clouds , indicating a possible trigger of the recent star formation by the interaction of the supershell with the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> isophotal analysis has been done for 50% of the clusters . a large number of objects present isophotal distortions commonly interpreted as sign of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> cluster multiplets are coeval within 20 myr , suggesting a common origin . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that clusters possibly form in large groups . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are in agreement with the unified view of multi - scale star formation , where a size - duration correlation is expected .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1_#1 _ # 1_#1 _ =    # 1 1.25 in .125 in .25 in    the lmc / smc are of fundamental importance to understand the star formation process . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the presence of super - giant shells due to stellar winds and supernovae allow us to study the secondary and self propagating star formation in galaxies . in this work we present preliminary results concerning a large region centered at the southern rim of the supershell lmc  4 ( @xmath0 at j2000 ) where about 50 clusters and associations are located . </S>",
    "<S> co clouds superposed on the h@xmath1 emission have been detected at the south - eastern side of the observed field ( yamaguchi et al 2001 ; mizuno et al 2000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation history of both clusters and field stars can provide information about the formation of the super - giant shell lmc  4 and its interactions with the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> b , v , i images have been taken using the eso 2.2 m telescope equipped with the wfi imager , covering 30@xmath2 30@xmath3 about . </S>",
    "<S> more than 100000 stars are found down to v@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the cluster / association age distribution from the analysis of the colour - magnitude diagrams , once that the field contamination is statistically removed . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster formation rate presents two major peaks , namely at 10 and 100 myr . </S>",
    "<S> minor episodes are found from 60 to 10 myr ago . finally , about 10% of the clusters are younger than 10 myr . comparing our age determination with the co cloud catalog by mizuno et al ( 2001 ) </S>",
    "<S> we find that while the youngest objects ( age less than 10 myr ) are mostly located close to the h@xmath1 and co emission , the oldest generation of clusters seems to be more evenly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the suggestion by yamaguchi et al ( 2001 ) that the star formation is triggered by the compression of the super - giant shell on the co clouds having a lifetime of a few million of years .    </S>",
    "<S> the star formation history of the field population presents recent episodes of star formation aged of 10 , 15 , 25,100 myr . </S>",
    "<S> a population of a few gyrs of field stars belonging to the red clump of he - burning objects is found to be uniformly distributed , being part of the pre - existing generation . </S>",
    "<S> main sequence stars in the age range 20 - 500 myr are showing a structure ( @xmath5 300 pc ) involving a large fraction of the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> an age gradient seems to be present in the field population from the inside towards the external rim of the studied region of the lmc  4 . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation episode aged of 10 - 20 myr found either in the field and in the cluster formation rate is in agreement with the epoch of the formation of lmc  4 estimated to happen 10 - 20 myr ago ( vallenari , bomans & de boer 1993 ; braun et al 1997 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> isophotal analysis has been done for about 50% of the objects classified as clusters . to remove the field and sky contamination </S>",
    "<S> the background outside 3 cluster diameters is fitted and subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> radial profiles are derived first smoothing the images with a gaussian filter and then masking the bright stars . </S>",
    "<S> distortions on the isophotal profiles such as tails , bridges , common envelopes are interpreted as sign of interaction between the clusters following de oliveira , dottori & bica ( 1998 ) and leon , bergond & vallenari ( 1999 ) . to avoid the effect of the noise due to bright stars , we quantify the asymmetry in the isophote distribution by means of the parameter @xmath6 where @xmath7 following vallenari et al ( 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> r is the radius of the isophote having the maximum value of the shift and xe and ye are the corresponding coordinates of the isophote centers . </S>",
    "<S> ( xc , yc ) is the center of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> unperturbed objects are characterized by @xmath8 as already determined by vallenari , bettoni & chiosi ( 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary analysis shows that in our sample more than 80% of the analyzed objects presents some signs of distortion having @xmath9 in the range 0.20 - 0.80 . </S>",
    "<S> cluster pairs and multiplets are coeval within 20 myr indicating a common origin . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the unified view of multi - scale star formation : the turbulence effects produce hierarchical structures in the gas ensuring that the triggering time scales with the size of the region ( elmegreen 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> clusters possibly form in large groups with high formation efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> multiplets are expected to merge into pairs or single objects on a time scale of the order of 100 myr ( de oliveira et al 2000 ) . </S>"
