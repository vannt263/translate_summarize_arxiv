    "recently , based on 58 million @xmath17 decay events and 14 million @xmath18 decay events collected with bes - ii detector  @xcite , many detailed partial wave analyses ( pwa ) have been performed in order to understand the structure , decays and production of the scalar mesons . in this paper , we present some of the results from such study at bes - ii .",
    "using the world largest @xmath0 data sample in @xmath19 annihilation experiment , bes - ii studied the scalars decay into pair of pseudoscalars ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) in @xmath0 radiative decays as well as recoiling against a @xmath24 or an @xmath25  @xcite .",

    "however , the existence of the second scalar particle needs confirmation : the signal observed in @xmath73 is rather in the edge of the phase space , and the reconstruction efficiency of the @xmath24 decreases dramatically as the momentum of the @xmath24 decreases thus the momentum of the kaon from @xmath24 decays is very low and can not be detected  @xcite .",
