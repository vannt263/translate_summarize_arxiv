    "liners ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ; heckman 1980 ) are found in a significant fraction of bright galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "the ionizing source of liners is still under debate ( see filippenko 1996 for a review ) , with candidate ionization mechanisms being photoionization by low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , photoionization by very hot stars , and collisional ionization by fast shocks .",
    "recent observations have shown that at least some liners are low - luminosity agns ( hereafter llagns ) ; see ho ( 1999a and references therein ) for a review . according to the extensive spectroscopic survey of ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , which includes all bright ( @xmath8 .5ex 12.5 mag ) galaxies with declinations greater than 0 , about 20% of liners exhibit a broad h@xmath0 emission line in their optical spectra .",
    "hard x - ray observations provide a powerful means for searching for evidence of an agn by detecting a pointlike hard x - ray source at the nucleus .",
    "compact hard x - ray sources have been detected in liners that show broad h@xmath0 emission ( hereafter liner 1s ; iyomoto et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; ptak et al . 1998 ; terashima et al . 1998a ; guainazzi & antonelli 1999 ; weaver et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra of these objects are well represented by a two - component model : a power - law component plus soft thermal emission .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the hard component are quite similar to those of seyfert galaxies , and typical x - ray luminosities are @xmath9  ergs s@xmath10 .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosities of liner 1s are positively correlated with the x - ray luminosities in the 210 kev band ( terashima 1999 ; terashima et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these observations strongly support the idea that most liner 1s are llagns .",
    "liners constitute the majority of the objects that show spectroscopic evidence for nuclear activity , and most liners ( @xmath11% ; ho et al .",
    "1997a , b ) show no detectable broad h@xmath0 emission and are classified as `` liner 2s '' . therefore , liner 2s are the most abundant form of low - level activity in nearby galaxies .",
    "it is not clear whether the origin of liner 2s is similar to that of liner 1s .",
    "if liner 2s are also genuine agns , then the emission from their nuclei may be obscured , by analogy with the popular obscuration model for seyfert 2 galaxies ( lawrence & elvis 1982 ; antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "if this is the case , then the x - ray spectra of liner 2s should show evidence for heavy absorption ( @xmath12 @xmath13  @xmath6 ) and strong fluorescent iron k emission lines .",
    "for example , ngc 1052 , a liner 1.9 ( ho et al .",
    "1997a ) from which polarized broad h@xmath0 line has been detected ( barth et al . 1999 ) , shows an x - ray spectrum absorbed by a column density of @xmath12 @xmath14  @xmath6 and a fluorescent iron  k emission line with an equivalent width of @xmath2300 ev ( weaver et al .",
    "these x - ray characteristics are quite similar to those of luminous seyfert 2 galaxies ( awaki et al . 1991a ; smith & done 1994 ; turner et al .",
    "thus , this is an example of an active nucleus which is a low - ionization analog of seyfert 2 galaxies such as ngc 1068 .",
    "alternatively , the optical emission lines in liner 2s may be ionized by sources other than an agn .",
    "collisional ionization from fast - moving shocks ( e.g. , koski & osterbrock 1976 ; fosbury et al .",
    "1978 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 ) and photoionization by a cluster of hot , young stars ( terlevich & melnick 1985 ; filippenko & terlevich 1992 ; shields 1992 ) have also been proposed as possible excitation mechanisms to power the narrow - line emission in liners .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of several liner 2s are available from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , and these indicate the presence of massive stars in some liner 2s ( maoz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that in ngc 404 , ngc 4569 , and ngc 5055 hot stars play a significant role as an ionizing source for the optical emission lines . in order to explain the observed h@xmath0 luminosities by stellar photoionization",
    ", however , very massive stars ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) are required to be still present ( see fig . 5 in maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "although uv spectroscopy can probe the presence of massive stars , only uv bright objects ( @xmath220%30% of liners ; maoz et al .",
    "1995 ; barth et al . 1998 ; ho , filippenko , & sargent 1999 ) can be studied . moreover , maoz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have argued that even in objects such as m81 , ngc 4579 or ngc 4594 , where an llagn is known to be present based on other evidence , the observed uv continuum power is insufficient to account for the observed line emission , and the nonstellar component most likely becomes more prominent at higher energies .",
    "searching for the ionizing source in the x - rays is necessary to test this hypothesis .",
    "only a limited number of x - ray observations of liner 2s have been performed so far .",
    "previous x - ray observations with _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ were limited to soft energies , where heavily obscured agns are difficult to detect .",
    "furthermore , the limited spectral resolution and bandpass of these observations can not distinguish the thermal emission of the host galaxy from the emission from the agn .",
    "we observed a small sample of three liner 2 nuclei ( ngc 404 , ngc 4111 , and ngc 4457 ) with the _ asca _ satellite to search for a hidden ionizing source ; the sample also included ngc 4192 and ngc 4569 , which are classified as `` transition objects , '' emission - line nuclei whose optical spectra suggest a composite source of ionization , possibly due to a genuine liner nucleus mixed in with signal from circumnuclear  regions .",
    "the imaging capability of _ asca _ ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) , which extends up to 10 kev , and its moderate spectral resolution enable it to identify thermal emission from the host galaxy . we also analyze the x - ray properties of ngc 4117 , a low - luminosity seyfert 2 galaxy serendipitously observed in the field of ngc 4111 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath17",
    "we summarize the _ asca _",
    "observations and data reduction . image and spectral analysis are reported in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we discuss the origin of x - ray emission and the ionizing source in type 2 liners in @xmath20 .",
    "a summary of our findings is presented in @xmath21 .",
    "we observed the three liner 2s and two transition objects shown in table 1 .",
    "these objects are selected from the palomar survey of nearby galaxies conducted by ho et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997a ) , for which ho et al . ( 1997b ) determined that broad h@xmath0 emission is not present .",
    "we selected objects that are bright in the narrow h@xmath0 emission line , since a large x - ray flux is expected if the ionization source is due to an agn ( halpern , & steiner 1983 ; elvis , soltan , & keel 1984 ; ward et al .",
    "1988 ; koratkar et al . 1995 ; terashima 1999 ; terashima et al .",
    "we also gave preference to objects that have previously been studied in the uv using the _",
    "hst_. both ngc 404 and ngc 4569 are uv bright and have been studied spectroscopically in the uv by maoz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while ngc 4111 and ngc 4192 were imaged in the uv but were not detected ( maoz et al . 1996 ; barth et al . 1998 ) .",

    "the observation mode of the solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) is summarized in table 2 ; the gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) were operated in the nominal pulse - height mode .",
    "we screened the data using standard criteria .",
    "we excluded data taken when ( 1 ) the elevation angle from the earth s limb was less than 5  , ( 2 ) the cut - off rigidity was less than 6 gev c@xmath10 , ( 3 ) the satellite was passing through the south atlantic anomaly , and ( 4 ) the elevation angle from the day earth s limb was less than 25  ( only for the sis ) . the observed count rates , after background subtraction , and the net exposure times , after data screening , are also tabulated in table 2 .",
    "although we observed ngc 404 , 4111 , 4192 and 4569 on two occasions in order to search for variability , no significant variability was found .",
    "the typical upper limit on variability is 50% .",
    "we therefore use images and spectra combined from the two observations in the following analysis . in this paper , the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level for one parameter of interest , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we detected x - ray emission from all objects except for ngc 404 . in this section , we show x - ray images and estimate the spatial extension of the x - ray emission .      the nucleus of ngc 404 was not detected in either the sis or in the gis images .",
    "one serendipitous source was detected in the sis image in the 0.52 kev band of the second observation .",

    "this source is not clearly seen in the gis image or in the sis image above 2 kev .",
    "we calculated an upper limit for the x - ray flux seen toward the nucleus of ngc 404 using the following procedure .",

    "the free parameters are the normalizations of the two psfs and the background level .",
    "we fitted the projected sis images in the 0.52 kev and 210 kev bands and obtained a 3@xmath27 upper limit of @xmath28 ergs s@xmath10 @xmath6 and @xmath29 ergs s@xmath10 @xmath6 , respectively , assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath30 = 2 . for an assumed distance of 2.4",

    "ngc 4111 is detected also in the sis image , but the other sources are out of the field of view of the detector . in order to estimate the spatial extent of the x - ray emission , we made azimuthally averaged radial profiles of surface brightness using the sis images and compared them with those of the psf .",

    "the galactic hydrogen column densities used in the spectral fits are derived from the observations by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",

    "we assumed a galactic value for the absorption column density of the rs component .",
    "the abundances were fixed at 0.1 of the solar value since it would otherwise not be well constrained from the data ; adopting other values ( 0.3 and 0.5 solar ) gave similar results within the errors . the absorption column density for the hard component",

    "it is worth noting that the temperatures of the thermal bremsstrahlung component in ngc 4111 and ngc 4457 are not well constrained , and only lower limits of the temperature are obtained",

    "this discrepancy is possibly due to the diffuse emission in the ngc 4569 field and to the different background extract regions . in the spectra of ngc 4569 , negative residuals are seen around 1.2 kev .",
    "this may be also due to imperfect subtraction of surrounding diffuse emission , since the temperature of the virgo intracluster gas in this region is @xmath2 2.5 kev , and both the fe  l line complex and the he - like mg line are expected around an energy of 1.11.3 kev ( bhringer et al .",
    "1994 ; matsumoto 1998 ) . because the sis and gis",
    "each has a different spatial resolution and field of view , we can not perfectly match the source - free region used for background subtraction .",

    "the hard x - ray ( 27 kev ) images of ngc 4111 and ngc 4569 are clearly extended on scales of several kpc , an indication that a nonstellar , active nucleus is not the primary source of the hard x - ray emission .",

    "it appears , therefore , that hard x - ray emission associated with starburst activity does not significantly contribute to the emission observed in the objects in our sample , although this conclusion remains at the moment tentative because only a small number of starburst galaxies have been studied in the hard x - rays .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the hot star contribution to the observed soft x - ray luminosity is minor .",
    "this argument also applies to all the objects in our sample , except for ngc 404 , for which only an upper limit of x - ray luminosity is available .",
    "finally , we note that scattered light from a hidden agn is unlikely to be the source of the soft x - ray emission .",

    "we estimate the number of ionizing photons needed to account for the observed h@xmath0 luminosities , assuming a spectral energy distribution of @xmath98 , which is the typical spectral shape between the uv and x - rays observed in llagns ( ho 1999b ) , case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) , and a covering factor of unity for the ionized gas .",
    "a value of @xmath83  @xmath68/@xmath97 = 1.4 is sufficient to explain the h@xmath0 luminosity by photoionization by an agn .",

    "galaxies in our sample have lower [ oi]@xmath100/h@xmath0 values than liners that are most likely to be agn . if the low [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio is due to dilution by regions , which produce strong balmer lines and very weak [ oi ] , the difference in @xmath68/@xmath97 between the two classes is reduced . since the median of the [ oi]/h@xmath0 ratio for the liner 2s is about a factor of 3 smaller than that for the liner 1s with llagns , the h@xmath0 emission tracing the agn would be 1/3 of the total measured value . even in this case , however , the observed hard x - ray luminosities are not enough to drive the h@xmath0 luminosities .",

    "characteristically lower than in `` normal '' giant extragalactic  regions also generates the spectral properties of transition objects ( filippenko , & terlevich 1992 ; shields 1992 ) .",
    "the presence of hot stars is seen directly in the uv spectrum of ngc 4569 ( maoz et al .",

    "the low x - ray output of these systems , as found in this study , lends further support for this conclusion .",
    "thus , at least some transition objects are likely to be powered by hot stars .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 4192 , however , is not detected in the uv band , possibly because of the large extinction due to the high inclination of the galaxy ( 83 ; barth et al .",

    "<S> we present _ asca _  observations of liners without broad h@xmath0 emission in their optical spectra . the sample of `` type 2 '' liners consists of ngc 404 , 4111 , 4192 , 4457 , and 4569 . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected x - ray emission from all the objects except for ngc 404 ; among the detected objects are two so - called transition objects ( ngc 4192 and ngc 4569 ) , which have been postulated to be composite nuclei having both an region and a liner component .    </S>",
    "<S> the images of ngc 4111 and ngc 4569 in the soft ( 0.52 kev ) and hard ( 27 kev ) x - ray bands are extended on scales of several kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of ngc 4111 , ngc 4457 and ngc 4569 are well fitted by a two - component model that consists of soft thermal emission with @xmath1 kev and a hard component represented by a power law ( photon index @xmath2 2 ) or by thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( @xmath3 @xmath2 several kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extended hard x - rays probably come from discrete sources , while the soft emission most likely originates from hot gas produced by active star formation in the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we have found no clear evidence for the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> using black hole masses estimated from host galaxy bulge luminosities , we obtain an upper limit on the implied eddington ratios less than @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if an agn component is the primary ionization source of the optical emission lines , then it must be heavily obscured with a column density significantly larger than @xmath5 @xmath6 , since the observed x - ray luminosity is insufficient to drive the luminosities of the optical emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the optical emission could be ionized by a population of exceptionally hot stars . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is consistent with the small [ o  i ] @xmath76300/h@xmath0 ratios observed in these sources , the ultraviolet spectral characteristics in the cases where such information exists , and the x - ray results reported here .    </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the x - ray properties of ngc 4117 , a low - luminosity seyfert 2 galaxy serendipitously observed in the field of ngc 4111 . </S>"
