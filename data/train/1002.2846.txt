    "the casimir effect @xcite is now known to be common to systems of very different kind , involving fluctuating quantities on which external boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "it can have important implications on all scales , from subnuclear to cosmological .",
    "imposing boundary conditions on a quantum field leads to a modification of the spectrum of zero - point fluctuations and results in the shifting in the vacuum expectation values for physical quantities , such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "in particular , the confinement of quantum fluctuations induces forces that act on the constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of the resulting vacuum forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , on the type of the spacetime manifold , the geometry of the boundaries , and on the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigation of the casimir effect is its explicit dependence on the geometry of the background spacetime . as usual ,",
    "the relevant information is encoded in the vacuum fluctuations spectrum and , not surprisingly , analytic solutions can be found for highly symmetric geometries only . in special ,",
    "motivated by randall  sundrum type braneworld scenarios , investigations of the casimir effect in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime have attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "the braneworld corresponds to a manifold with boundaries and all fields which propagate in the bulk will give casimir - type contributions to the vacuum energy and , as a result , to the vacuum forces acting on the branes .",
    "the casimir effect provides in this context a natural mechanism for stabilizing the radion field in the randall  sundrum model , as required for a complete solution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , the casimir energy gives a contribution to both the brane and bulk cosmological constants and , hence , it has to be taken into account in any self - consistent formulation of the braneworld dynamics . the casimir energy and corresponding casimir forces for two parallel branes in ads spacetime have been evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite by using either dimensional or zeta function regularization methods .",
    "local casimir densities were considered in refs .",
    "the casimir effect in higher - dimensional generalizations of the ads spacetime with compact internal spaces has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "another popular background in gravitational physics is de sitter ( ds ) spacetime .",
    "quantum field theory in this background has been extensively studied during the past two decades .",
    "much of the early interest was motivated by questions related with the quantization of fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "the ds spacetime has a high degree of symmetry and numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background .",
    "importance of such theoretical work was increased with the appearance of the inflationary cosmology scenario  @xcite . in most inflationary models ,",
    "an approximate ds spacetime is employed with the aim to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology . during the inflationary epoch ,",
    "quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field introduce inhomogeneities which play a central role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "more recently , astronomical observations of standard - candle supernovae , galaxy clusters and the cosmic microwave background @xcite have clearly indicated that at present our ( local ) universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by @xmath0cdm , frw cosmology with a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "now , if the universe , as it seems , is going to accelerate for ever , this cosmology will lead asymptotically to a ds universe .",
    "another motivation for the investigation of ds - based quantum theories is related to the holographic duality known to hold between quantum gravity on ds spacetime and a quantum field theory living on its boundary , identified with the timelike infinity surface of the ds spacetime .    motivated by the above considerations  and since they are ingredients that more full - fledged models will necessarily have to incorporate  we will here calculate the casimir densities and forces arising for the geometry of two parallel plates on the background of @xmath1-dimensional ds spacetime .",
    "previously , the casimir effect on the background of ds spacetime described in planar coordinates was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite for a conformally coupled massless scalar field . in this last case",
    "the problem is conformally related to the corresponding problem in minkowski spacetime and the vacuum characteristics are generated from those for the minkowski counterpart , just by multiplying with the conformal factor . in particular , for the geometry of a single plate , the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor vanishes .",
    "the casimir density induced by a single plate for a massive scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter has been considered in @xcite . in @xcite the vacuum expectation value of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor for a conformally coupled scalar field was investigated in ds spacetime with static coordinates in presence of curved branes , on which the field obeys the robin boundary conditions with coordinate dependent coefficients . in those papers the conformal relation between ds and rindler spacetimes and the results for the rindler counterpart were used .",
    "more recently , the casimir density in a ds spacetime with toroidally compactified spatial dimensions has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "the positive frequency wightman function will be evaluated for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter with robin boundary conditions on two parallel plane boundaries in the background of ds spacetime . among the most important quantities describing the local properties of a quantum field and the corresponding quantum back - reaction effects are the expectation values of the field squared and of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these quantities , in the region between the plates , will be investigated in sects .",

    "the importance of these two special cases comes from the fact that , in the massless limit , the corresponding fields mimic the behavior of gravitons and photons , respectively .",
    "note that non - minimal coupling is required by the renormalizability condition for interacting theories in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will be interested in the study of the casimir densities and of the mutual forces occurring for the geometry of two infinite , parallel plates in ds spacetime .",
