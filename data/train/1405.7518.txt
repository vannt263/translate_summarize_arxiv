    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) form around stars of low and intermediate mass ( @xmath1  m@xmath2 ) towards the end of their evolution .",
    "the nebula originates from the interaction between a fairly dense ( @xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 ) ` slow wind ' ( @xmath310 km s@xmath5 ) lost by the star as a red giant on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) with a tenuous ( @xmath310@xmath6 m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 ) ` fast wind ' ( @xmath31000  km  s@xmath5 ) that follows after the agb phase .",
    "the nebula material becomes ionized once the effective temperature of the central star , which evolves into a white dwarf , exceeds 25000 k ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 6302 ( pn g349.5@xmath701.0 ) is a bipolar pn .",
    "its complex and clumpy morphology shown in h@xmath0 and [ nii ] _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images @xcite can be roughly approximated by a bipolar shape with the two main lobes extending in the east - west direction .",
    "it presents a highly pinched waist which is characteristic for butterfly - shaped bipolar pne @xcite .",
    "the central star of ngc 6302 was directly detected for the first time by @xcite .",
    "it was partially obscured by a dense equatorial lane @xcite and molecular material observed in co emission @xcite that is tracing an expanding torus oriented in the north - south direction , approximately perpendicular to the optical nebula axis . the distance to this nebula",
    "was not known accurately .",
    "@xcite gave a firm lower limit of 0.8@xmath80.3  kpc based on a radio expansion proper - motion ( pm ) measurement of the nebular core , and estimate a distance of 2.2@xmath81.1  kpc from measurements of pressure - broadening of radio recombination lines .",
    "lately , @xcite determined an unambiguous distance of 1.17@xmath80.14  kpc , derived from expansion pms of 15 knots located at the northwestern lobe of the nebula .",
    "these pms were measured comparing two ground - based images with a time separation of @xmath351  yr , indicating a hubble - type expansion .",
    "hubble - type outflows are characterised by an expansion velocity that increases linearly with the distance to the central star .",
    "this type of outflow has been observed also in other objects , i.e. , the nebula around the symbiotic system hen 2 - 104 @xcite , ngc 6537 @xcite , mz 3 @xcite , see @xcite for other examples .",
    "recently , szyszka et al . (",
    "2011 ) measured the expansion pms in ngc 6302 , comparing two _ hst _ images in [ nii ] separated by 9.4 yr .",
    "the velocity field follows a hubble law in agreement with the previous results of @xcite .",
    "the pm vectors present a pattern mostly radial pointing back to the central source with a position close to the central star detected by @xcite .",
    "their results show that the lobes of ngc 6302 were ejected during a brief event 2250@xmath835 yr ago ( in agreement with the result of @xcite ) , and they find evidence for a subsequent acceleration that increased the velocity of the inner regions by 9.2  km  s@xmath5 , possibly related to the onset of the ionization .    in this work",
    ", we investigate whether or not the morphological and kinematical characteristics of ngc 6302 can result from the interaction between an isotropic fast wind with a toroidally - shaped slow wind .",
    "we have also considered a clumpy structure for the slow wind , based on observations of agb shells , which look like clumpy and filamentary shell structures @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the basic assumptions and the initial conditions used in the numerical simulations . in section 3",
    ", we present the results including synthetic h@xmath0 emission maps , simulated pms of nebular knots , and their comparison with the observations .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss the implications of our results and give our conclusions .",
    "our simulations are based on the generalisation of the interacting stellar winds model ( gisw ) in which , an isotropic fast wind launched by a star expands into a previously ejected toroidally - shaped slow wind @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the slow wind has a density distribution with a high contrast between the equator and the pole , which is described by the following equation ( given by @xcite ) @xmath9 with @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the distance from the central star and @xmath12 is the polar angle ( @xmath13 at the pole , and @xmath14 at the equator ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 determines the ratio between the value of the density at the equator and that at the pole , while @xmath15 determines the shape of the variation , and therefore that of the slow wind ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath16 can be calculated from the mass - loss rate @xmath17 as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the constant terminal velocity of the agb wind and @xmath20 is the radius of the region where the stellar wind is imposed .    the 3d numerical simulations were performed with the hydrodynamical code @xcite , which integrates the gas dynamical equations with a second - order accurate scheme ( in time and space ) using the ` flux - vector splitting ' method of @xcite on a binary adaptive grid . a rate equation for neutral hydrogen is integrated together with the gas dynamics equations to include the radiative losses through a parametrized cooling function that depends on the density , temperature and hydrogen ionization fraction @xcite .    to model the ngc 6302 nebula ,",
    "we have used a computational domain of @xmath21  cm along the @xmath22- , @xmath23- , and @xmath24-axes , respectively .",
    "five refinement levels were allowed in the adaptive cartesian grid , achieving a resolution of @xmath25  cm at the finest level . for the initial condition we have filled the computational domain with the density distribution obtained from equation ( 1)-(3 ) with @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 equal to @xmath26  m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  cm , respectively .",
    "we have used @xmath29 and @xmath30 in order to reproduce the observed morphology .    to simulate a ` clumpy ' circumstellar medium ( csm ) , we have modulated the density by a fractal structure with a spectral index of @xmath31 , which is consistent with a turbulent interstellar medium ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this clumpy density is imposed on the initial condition and has fluctuations on the order of @xmath32 of the mean density value . in this csm",
    ", we start an isotropic and fast stellar wind with mass injection @xmath33 of @xmath34  m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 , and a velocity @xmath35 of @xmath36 .",
    "the 3d hydrodynamical simulations of two interacting winds were carried out with the setup given in section 2 .",
    "the fast wind generates a shock wave which propagates into the surrounding csm .",
    "a global bipolar morphology is generated and a similar size to the observed one is achieved after a time of 2000  yr , which is in agreement with the dynamical age given by szyszka et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    from the density and temperature distribution given by our 3d hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", we can perform synthetic h@xmath0 maps . in fig .",
    "[ fha ] , we show the synthetic h@xmath0 emission maps obtained for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 projections ( left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fha ] , respectively ) , using an angle @xmath39 .",
    "this angle @xmath40 is the angle between the nebula axis ( the @xmath24 axis of the computational domain ) and the plane of the sky , in agreement with previous observational results @xcite .",
    "[ fha ] shows a bipolar morphology for both projections , with a waist of @xmath41  cm , which has a similar size to the observed one ( @xmath42 if a distance of 1.17 kpc is considered ) .",
    "furthermore , both panels display a filamentary and clumpy structure , which is a consequence of the interaction between the fast wind and the clumpy slow wind .",

    "the angle @xmath40 is the angle between the nebula axis ( the @xmath43 axis of the computational domain ) and the plane of the sky .",
    "the vertical and horizontal axes are in units of 10@xmath44 cm .",

    "then , we obtain the pms of the knots found in the simulation using a cross - correlation method .",
    "we have used the `` pm mapping '' technique described by @xcite , in which , the pms from pair of images are derived by defining boxes including emitting knots and carrying out a cross - correlation function of the emission within the boxes .",
    "the pm is obtained from a fit to the peak of the cross - correlation function .",
    "this method has proven to be better than carrying out direct fits ( e.g. , a gaussian or a two - dimensional paraboloid ) to the observed emission features , because the cross - correlation functions , which are integrals of the emission within the chosen boxes , have higher signal - to - noise ratios than the images .",
    "the cross - correlation boxes have a size of 30@xmath4630 pixels equivalent to 10@xmath4610 arcsec@xmath47 . for a given box of size @xmath48",
    ", we first check whether or not the condition @xmath49 is satisfied in at least one pixel within the central inner box of size @xmath50 ( see appendix of @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath51 is the h@xmath0 flux of the image and @xmath52 is set equal to @xmath34 erg  s@xmath5  @xmath45  sr@xmath5 .",
    "if this condition is met at least for a single pixel in each of the two epochs that are being analysed , the cross - correlation function ( within the @xmath48-size box in the two images ) and the pm are computed .",
    "[ fhapm ] shows the @xmath38 projection of the synthetic h@xmath0 map overlaid by white arrows which represent pm vectors calculated with the `` pm mapping '' technique .",
    "interestingly , the pms show deviations from the radial direction mostly for filamentary features in the outer regions of the outflow lobes . for a spatially extended filamentary structure ,",
    "the pm perpendicular to the locus of the emission is well determined . while the component of the pm of the flow along the filament is highly uncertain , resulting in a large dispersion of the pm vectors determined for filamentary features .",

    "the vertical colour bar gives the h@xmath0 flux in units of erg  s@xmath5  @xmath45  sr@xmath5 .",
    "the length of each arrow indicates the relative pm of the h@xmath0 emission knots computed in 10@xmath4610 arcsec@xmath47 boxes .",

    "[ figpms ] shows pms vs. distance to the central star plots for the top lobe ( left panel ) and bottom lobe ( right panel ) . from this figure",
    ", we note that the more distant filaments and knots move faster than those located near the source .",
    "however , the pms obtained from our model do not resemble the behaviour given by a hubble - type expansion , such as found in the ngc 6302 observations ( szyszka et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the hubble - type expansion is represented in both panels of fig .",
    "[ figpms ] by dashed lines .",
    "we can see from the fig .",
    "[ figpms ] that many of the knots far from the source have velocities comparable to the observations , however we see a majority with velocities below the hubble - type expansion . at the same time",
    ", the knots that are closer to the source ( @xmath54 ) , have a remarkably constant pm , well below the observations .",
    "this result suggest that an additional acceleration mechanism is needed , particularly near the central star , which is consistent with the findings of szyszka et al .",
    "a possible candidate for this acceleration mechanism is the ionizing flux from the central star , which would photoevaporate the clumps and push them through a rocket effect ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this , and any other acceleration mechanism is not included in our models , and will be pursued in a following work .",
    "we have carried out 3d hydrodynamical simulations of a two interacting - winds model , in order to explain both the global morphology and the tangential velocity of the pn ngc 6302 .",
    "we reproduce the morphology and size of the nebula after an integration time of 2000 yr , which is similar to the dynamical time estimate given by szyszka et al .",
    "we note the that it was necessary to use a high equator to pole density contrast of @xmath31000 to obtain the observed morphology .",
    "a pm study was done on the synthetic h@xmath0 images during a time span of 10 yr similar to the time span between observed images .",
    "the magnitude of the pms as well as the separation from the central star are quantitatively similar , although the obtained pms do not follow a hubble - type expansion as the observations indicate .",
    "this suggests that an additional acceleration mechanism is acting , in particularly near the central star where the pm discrepancy is larger . a possible candidate for this mechanism",
    "is the rocket effect from the photoevaporation of the clumps , due to the radiation of the central star .",
