    "a stellar jet appearing at the final stage of stellar evolution is a manifestation of the important , but still poorly understood phenomenon leading to the formation of asymmetric planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "bipolar and multipolar optical morphologies and the common presence of point symmetry are frequently found in a sample of young pne .",
    "based on this fact , @xcite concluded that collimated jets have been operational in a large fraction of pne , and are one of the major factors shaping these objects .",
    "similar morphologies have been found in a survey of pre - planetary nebulae ( ppne , @xcite ; sahai  2007 in preparation ) , leading to the current paradigm that such a collimated jet is launched near or at an earlier phase of stellar evolution  the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase - and is frequently observable in molecular line emission .",
    "there are a small number of candidate sources that show us the earliest stage of stellar jet emergence . ",
    "water fountain sources  are the most promising candidates ; they are stellar objects that have extremely high - velocity flows traced by 2o  maser emission .",
    "the outflow velocity sometimes exceeds 100 , much greater than the typical expansion velocity of circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) of mira variable and oh / ir stars traced by 1612-mhz oh maser emission ( 1025 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "vlbi observations of some of these 2o  maser sources have revealed that the jets are highly collimated and have extremely short dynamical ages ( @xmath15100  yr , @xcite : paper i ; indmd05 ; @xcite ) .    collimated bipolar outflows in _ young _ stellar objects are perhaps in atomic or ionized form as a result of the violent acceleration processes which brought the outflows to very high velocities . on the other hand ,",
    "the molecules are believed to form in the compressed , rapidly cooling , post - shock regions at the interface between the jets and ambient molecular clouds ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar interaction is expected between a fast stellar jet and the ambient , slow agb outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in either case , molecular emission in stellar jets , as seen in 2o  maser emission , is strongly collimated both geometrically and kinematically .",
    "this implies that high density gas , which may not be originally molecular , is supplied from the very vicinity of the stellar surface or the innermost part of the cse to the jet tips . in the water fountain source w43a , precession of the stellar jet",
    "is also confirmed ( indmd05 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the 2o  maser emission in w43a exhibits strong zeeman splitting and linear polarization , strongly suggesting that the w43a jet is driven magneto - hydrodynamically .",
    "the launching of such jets apparently takes place at the end of the agb phase or the beginning of the post - agb phase during which stellar mass loss is still most active .    the 2o  maser emission in the `` water fountains ''",
    "is located over 100  au away from the central stellar objects , so it does not shed any light on regions close to the stars .",
    "it is still unclear whether the dynamical center of the jet coincides with the evolved star itself .",
    "however , the symmetrical placement about the central star as seen in many planetary and pre - pne suggests that such jet - induced shock structures  which are likely to be related to the 2o maser spot clusters in the water fountain sources  are both spatially and dynamically centered on the star .",
    "note that , on the other hand , a molecular stellar jet traced by 2o  maser emission will disappear within 1000  yr or shorter because of the imminent exposure of the pn nucleus that causes photo - dissociation of 2o  ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "the number of water fountain candidates is increasing , so the duration of the water fountain phase should be better determined statistically and kinematically . within this short period , the spatio - kinematical structures of the 2o  maser emission should undergo substantial evolution , which might be directly confirmed by long - term observations within a human lifetime .    in this paper",

    "even with such large position offsets , the fit to the annual parallax turns out to be quite reasonable .",
    "the best - fit annual parallax corresponds to a distance to i19134 , @xmath2  kpc .",
    "the implications of the water fountains for the formation of bipolar pne were discussed in paper i , but the new observations presented here should provide new insights into the general properties of the water fountains and their associated central stars .",
    "the spatio - kinematics of 2o masers in all water fountain sources reveal that the duration of the water - fountain stage is less than 100  yr . in this time interval ,",
    "a stellar jet traveling with a typical velocity of 100  reaches a distance of @xmath12000  au from the central star .",
    "this corresponds to the typical size of an oh maser shell in a cse around an oh / ir star , at the final stage of copious mass loss .",
    "the 2o maser emission is excited near the tip of the stellar jet where high compression takes place in the shock at the interface between the jet and the ambient circumstellar gas .",
    "but because the ambient gas density declines with radius , the maser emission may be quenched at the distance where the post - shock gas density falls below a critical value , @xmath4810@xmath49 @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "note that while optical lobes are observed in some water fountains ( i19134 and iras  16342@xmath123814 , hereafter abbreviated as i16342 ) , the optical emission has not yet been detected in others ( w43a and oh  12.8@xmath120.9 ) .",
    "this implies that the presence of water fountains may help in the identification of new ppne , which may be optically invisible due to high circumstellar or interstellar extinction . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of water fountains has grown by almost a factor of four since this class was first recognized @xcite , implying that the lifetime of each water fountain may be much longer than that previously estimated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the water fountain phenomenon may occur repeatedly in the same source .",
    "however , it is premature to give a conclusion about this issue . the total number of stellar 2o masers associated with agb and post - agb stars is still increasing and is too small ( @xmath511,000 , e.g. , @xcite ) to precisely estimate the duration of the water fountain phase whose number of occurrences is only about 10 .",
    "if the water fountain lifetime estimated here is presently known , the total number of stellar 2o masers in the whole agb phase gives the duration of 2o maser excitation , which is inversely estimated from the lifetime of the water fountains ( @xmath1100  yr ) .",
    "the duration of 2o maser excitation is thereby estimated to be only @xmath5110@xmath52  yr .",
    "this is much shorter than @xmath53  yr , which is the expected time period for excitation of 2o masers during agb / post - agb phase . on this time scale ,",
    "an agb star loses a total mass of @xmath11  @xmath11 at the maximum stellar mass loss rate ( typically 10@xmath54  yr@xmath16 ) , which is sufficiently high for excitation of 2o masers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that not all stellar 2o maser sources necessarily pass through the water fountain stage ; bipolar nebulae that have jets may be a restricted class of stellar 2o masers .    as shown in ",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] , the optical lobes in i19134 coexist with the 2o maser emission .",
    "this is a case similar to that found in i16342 , where the masers lie just beyond the tips of the optical lobes @xcite .",
    "we adopt the paradigm that the lobes have recently been formed along with the collimated fast jet .",
    "then the cse around the evolved star may have been sculpted and evacuated by the jet , allowing starlight to escape and be scattered by dust in , or at the edge of , the resulting lobes .",
    "i19134 and i16342 are presumably at a similar transitional stage between the agb and post - agb phases .",
    "also the inclination of the i16342 jet is estimated to be @xmath140  with respect to the sky plane @xcite , similar to that of i19134 ( @xmath035 ) .",
    "the ratios of peak surface brightness between the two lobes are 3.4 and 6.2 for i19134 and i16342 , respectively , but the low spatial resolution in i19134 might reduce the ratio slightly from the intrinsic contrast . i16342",
    "has larger separations of the optical lobes and the maser components ( 18 and 3  or @xmath03600  au and 6000  au at 2  kpc , respectively ) than those in i19134 ( @xmath01200  au ) .",
    "however , the difference in the dynamical ages of the jets in these two systems is still comparable to their implied dynamical ages ( @xmath55100  yr ) .    does the size of a cse",
    "determine the lifetime of a water fountain , or a collimated stellar jet traced by molecular emission ?",
    "we already know that 2o masers can survive until photoionization of the cse starts to form a pn , such as in k3@xmath1235 and iras  17347@xmath123139 @xcite , but they do not exhibit water fountains . in k3@xmath1235 ,",
    "2o maser emission is seen at the tips of the radio lobes , but it is not morphologically collimated so much and the radial velocities of the masers are very slow ( a radial velocity range of only 15 ) .",
    "this implies that any initially collimated jet that might have been present and traceable by 2o maser emission has disappeared . in k3@xmath1235",
    ", 2o maser emission is also seen in the inner and denser part of the cse where uv radiation from the star has not yet penetrated .",
    "this raises the possibility that 2o maser emission can be excited while the spatio - kinematical collimation of a water fountain is being destroyed .",
    "such low velocity maser components have been found in other water fountains alongside the high velocity ones @xcite .",
    "the dynamical age of the radio lobes of k3@xmath1235 is estimated to be 800  yr @xcite .",
    "this may correspond to an upper limit to the lifetime of a water fountain source but is an order of magnitude longer than the dynamical age estimated using vlbi observations of the maser spatio - kinematical structures . in i19134 , the morphological similarity of the two broad - band images shown in figure [ fig : hst ] suggests that the optical lobes are due to scattered starlight , rather than emission lines as in a pn .",
    "therefore we speculate that the collimated jet may drill through the cse formed during the agb phase and the tip of the jet may soon reach the outer boundary of the envelope .",
    "there the density declines precipitously and the maser levels are no longer sufficiently excited to produce observable emission",
    ". the masers lying beyond the optical lobes , such as those in i16342 , might thus disperse and disappear within a few centuries owing to the decline of the gas density in the pre - shock gas as the jet propagates outward .",
    "does the cse size play a significant role in determining the lifetime of the water fountain ?",
    "the question can be answered with a statistical comparison of the dynamical time scales for the water fountains to the time scale on which photoionized radio lobes emerge and expand along the axis of the water fountains .      in the present analysis ,",
    "we adopt a galactocentric distance and a galactic rotation velocity of the sun to be 8.0  kpc and 217 , respectively @xcite .",
    "then , on the basis of our inferred heliocentric distance and the systemic secular motion of i19134 , we infer the location of i19134 [ @xmath56(54.867 , 4.642 ) ] in the galaxy to be , @xmath57 and the 3-d velocity vector in galactic cylindrical coordinates to be , @xmath58}.\\ ] ]    the bias due to the solar motion with respect to the local - standard of rest has been corrected , but is relatively small ( @xmath03 ) .",
    "the derived heliocentric and galactocentric distances of 8.0  kpc and 7.4  kpc , respectively , are much smaller than those ( @xmath016  kpc and @xmath013  kpc , respectively ) estimated by the kinematical distance method using only the systemic radial velocity ( @xmath2567 ) .",
    "as described in paper i and shown in figure [ fig : kinematic - distance ] , the kinematical distance obtained using both the radial velocity and the secular proper motion , with the assumption of circular galactic rotation , is estimated to be about 8.0  kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the annual - parallax distance .",
    "the estimated location is within 1  kpc of the perseus spiral arm ( c.f . , @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that the estimated galactic azimuthal velocity of i19134 ( @xmath0125 ) is much slower than that implied by the galactic rotation curve ( @xmath0220 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it implies that i19134 s orbit must have large excursions in radius although it must be orbiting near its maximum in galactocentric distance at present .",
    "i19134 is apparently orbiting as a member of the galactic  thick disk  component rather than the",
    " thin disk  component .",
    "thus the high galactic latitude of i19134 favors a low mass of i19134 , allowing for it to orbit as a member of the galactic thick disk component . adopting the source velocity perpendicular to the galactic plane , @xmath598",
    ", we find that the present galactic altitude gives a lower limit to the travel time of i19134 from the galactic plane to the present position to be @xmath6010@xmath61  yr .",
    "this suggests that the central star of i19134 has a lifetime of at least this travel time and a stellar mass smaller than @xmath0 8.6  @xmath11 ( here we adopt a stellar lifetime to be @xmath62 ) if the central star of i19134 was born in the galactic plane as a member of the galactic",
    " thin disk  component .",
    "the timescale for a star that initially has thin disk kinematics to acquire thick disk kinematical characteristics is very likely to be far larger than 2.4@xmath6310@xmath61  yr , so i19134 is therefore likely to have a much larger age than this timescale .",
    "the statistical study of galactic pne by @xcite shows that the galactic scale height of bipolar pne , such as i19134 may become , is @xmath64100  pc , suggesting that their progenitors should be high mass stars .",
    "although i19134 s progenitor is expected to be such a high mass star , the present galactic altitude of i19134 and its anomalously slow galactic rotation velocity are quite odd .",
    "these may imply an abnormal environment during the birth of i19134 s central star .",
    "thus , the mass of i19134 s progenitor is an interesting puzzle .",
    "together with the spatio - kinematical structures of other water fountain sources , the spatio - kinematical structures of 2o masers in i19134 have shown that the dynamical ages of the water fountains are shorter than 100  yr .",
    "more precise ages and more detailed physical conditions of such stellar jets should be elucidated by future observations of thermal molecular emission in infrared and radio wavelengths with high angular resolution ( @xmath6501 ) to trace the whole morphology of the jets , including the regions without maser emission .",
    "optically visible lobes resulting from scattered starlight are found in i16342 and i19134 but have not yet been found in w43a and other water fountain sources .",
    "this implies that a water fountain is produced during the transition from the agb phase , when mass loss is greatest and the cse is the thickest , to the post - agb phase .",

    "high precision astrometry for 2o masers at the 10-@xmath47as level has enabled us to directly measure the distances to a galactic source located up to 8  kpc from the sun and to determine the location and kinematics of such distant sources throughout the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these parameters of",
    "the water fountain sources may provide additional probes to estimate ages and masses of their central stars , helping us to understand which progenitor stellar mass range produces the water fountain sources . for i19134 , we obtained an upper limit to the progenitor mass , @xmath66  @xmath11 .",
    "the accuracy of the proper motion of and parallactic distance to i19134 , and thus its full three - dimensional velocity found after the intrinsic maser motions are subtracted , may be improved with sensitive vlba observations over a longer time baseline . to find a better kinematical model for the intrinsic motions , in particular ,",

    "<S> using the _ very long baseline array _ at six epochs , we have observed 2o  maser emission in the pre - planetary nebula 1913 ( i19134 ) , in which the 2o maser spectrum has two groups of emission features separated in radial velocity by @xmath0100 . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained optical images of i19134 with the _ hubble space telescope _ to locate the bipolar reflection nebula in this source for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the spatio - kinematical structure of the 2o  masers indicates the existence of a fast , collimated ( precessing ) flow having a projected extent of @xmath0140  mas and an expansion rate of @xmath01.9  on the sky plane , which gives a dynamical age of only @xmath040  yr . </S>",
    "<S> the two detected optical lobes are also separated by @xmath1150  mas in almost the same direction as that of the collimated flow . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement between the extent and orientation of the 2o  maser outflow and optical lobes suggests that the lobes have been recently formed along the collimated fast flow . </S>",
    "<S> thus the circumstellar envelope around the evolved star has apparently been penetrated by the fast flow and has been cleared to form the way for the emergence of the starlight in the directions of the fast flow . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of all of the detected maser features have been measured with respect to the extragalactic reference source 1925 over one year . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we analyzed maser feature motions that consist of the combination of an annual parallax , a secular motion following galactic rotation , and the intrinsic motions within the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an annual - parallax distance to i19134 of @xmath2  kpc and estimate its location in the galaxy to be @xmath3(@xmath4  kpc , 62@xmath5 , @xmath6  kpc ) . from the mean motion of the blue - shifted and red - shifted clusters of maser features , we estimate the 3-d secular motion of i19134 to be @xmath7 [ km  s@xmath8 . from the height from the galactic plane , @xmath9 , and the velocity component perpendicular to the galactic plane , @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a rough upper limit of @xmath19  @xmath11 to the stellar mass of i19134 s progenitor . </S>"
