    "it is well known that the @xmath0meson has been observed in two different reactions : in @xmath14-collisions@xcite and @xmath15 @xcite .    since that time experimental and theoretical studies of @xmath0production",
    "have been going on . as a result of high statistics and high resolution experiments a large information on the properties of the @xmath0meson",
    "have been collected , on the production processes and on its numerous decays . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the interpretation of the data , in particular in confinement regime , is very controversial . as an example",
    ", the @xmath16quark mass is too large , if compared to predictions from chiral symmetry , but for theories based on expansion of heavy quark mass ( heavy quark effective theory ) , this mass is too small @xcite . in principle",
    "all data on @xmath0 should be explained in the framework of qcd .",
    "for example , the typical picture of charm production ( open or hidden ) should unify the different steps : parton - level hard process with production of @xmath17-pairs , after the step of hadronization of @xmath17- into @xmath4 or into charmed hadrons ( mesons and baryons ) and the final state interaction of the produced charmed hadrons with other particles .",
    "the relatively large transferred momenta involved in most processes of @xmath0production in hadron - hadron collisions allow to treat the first step in framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "but the applicability of qcd is not so straightforward for the description of the @xmath18-quark hadronization .",
    "this is correct especially for exclusive reactions , such as , for example , @xmath4 production in nucleon - nucleon collision : @xmath7 .",
    "note that the threshold for this reaction is large : @xmath19=12.24 gev which corresponds to @xmath20 5 gev , whereas experimental data about @xmath21 are available for @xmath22 6.7 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore the experimental study of @xmath7 near threshold is an important part of the program of the future accelerator facility at gsi @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of threshold @xmath4 production will bring important information with respect to the following issues .",
    "first of all the threshold meson production in @xmath23-collisions gives deeper insight in the reaction mechanisms as it is shown by recent experiments on @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "in this respect , @xmath0production has a specific interest : the production and the propagation of charm in ion - ion collisions has been considered as one of the most promising probe of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite .",
    "the productions of charmonium ( hidden strangeness ) and @xmath27 @xmath28 mesons ( open charm ) are equally important .",
    "the suppression of charmonium production in heavy ion collisions has been indicated as a signature of qgp @xcite , but in order to state the evidence of a clear signal , it is necessary to analyze in detail all possible mechanisms for @xmath0production in ion - ion collisions , and also all other processes which are responsible for the dissociation of the produced @xmath0meson , such as @xmath29 , for example .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study @xmath0production in the simplest @xmath23-reactions : @xmath30 and @xmath10 . in the near threshold region",
    "there is no experimental information about a possible difference in @xmath5- and @xmath11-collisions .",
    "there are no theoretical predictions for such exclusive processes , which are very difficult to treat in framework of qcd .",
    "it is possible to find some phenomenological parametrizations @xcite of the energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath31 , without any consideration on possible isotopic effects .",
    "however , previous experience with light meson production @xcite , @xmath32 , showed an essential difference in @xmath33 and @xmath34cross sections , in particular in the near threshold region , and there is no physical reason for a different behavior in @xmath0production .",
    "it is evident that the knowledge of the elementary process @xmath35 is very important for a realistic calculation of @xmath0production in nucleus - nucleus collisions .    in principle",
    "the elastic @xmath0production in @xmath23-collisions can be treated in full analogy with processes of light vector meson production .",
    "all symmetry properties of the strong interaction , such as the pauli principle , the isotopic invariance , the p - invariance , which have been successfully applied to light vector meson production in @xmath23-collisions @xcite , hold for @xmath0production , too .",
    "a formalism can be built , which is particularly simplified in the threshold region , where final particles are produced in @xmath36-state .",
    "simple considerations indicate that this region is quite wide : the effective proton size , which is responsible for charm creation , has to be quite small , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the @xmath18-quark mass @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath36-wave picture can be applied for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the @xmath0 three - momentum in the reaction center of mass ( cms ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the first chapter",
    "we establish the spin structure of the threshold matrix for the two @xmath23-processes : @xmath41 @xmath42 in terms of partial @xmath43wave amplitudes , and calculate the simplest polarization observables in terms of these amplitudes . in chapter 2",
    "we treat the dynamical issue in terms of @xmath8channel exchange mechanisms by light mesons .",
    "we give numerical predictions in framework of a @xmath44-model .",
    "the experimental data about different hadronic decays of @xmath0meson may give constrains on our predictions .",
    "in the general case the spin structure of the matrix element for the process @xmath45 is described by a set of 48 independent complex amplitudes , which are functions of five kinematical variables . the same reaction , in coplanar kinematics ,",
    "is described by 24 amplitudes , functions of four variables . in collinear kinematics the number of independent amplitudes is reduced to 7 and the description of this reaction is further simplified in case of threshold @xmath46-meson production , where all final particles are in @xmath36-state .    applying the selection rules following from the pauli principle , the p - invariance and the conservation of the total angular momentum , it is possible to prove that the threshold process @xmath47 is characterized by a single partial transition : @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the total spin of the two protons in the initial ( final ) states and @xmath51 is the orbital momentum of the colliding protons . in the cms of the considered reaction",
    ", the matrix element corresponding to transition ( [ eq : eqpp ] ) can be written as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) are the two - component spinors of the initial ( final ) protons ; @xmath57 is the three - vector of the @xmath46-meson polarization , @xmath58 is the unit vector along the 3-momentum of the initial proton ; @xmath59 is the s - wave partial amplitude , describing the triplet - singlet transition of the two - proton system in v - meson production .    in case of @xmath11-collisions , applying the conservation of isotopic invariance for the strong interaction , two threshold partial transitions",
    "are allowed : @xmath60 @xmath61 with the following spin structure of the matrix element : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the s - wave partial amplitude describing the singlet - triplet transition of the two - nucleon system in v - meson production . in the general case",
    "the amplitudes @xmath59 and @xmath63 are complex functions , depending on the energies @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath66 are the energies of the initial ( final ) proton and of the produced @xmath68meson , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath59 is the common amplitude for @xmath5- and @xmath11-collisions , due to the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction .",
    "this explains the presence of the coefficient 2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpp ] ) .",
    "the parametrizations ( [ eq : mpp ] ) and ( [ eq : mnp ] ) are model independent descriptions of the spin structure for threshold production of any vector meson in @xmath23-collisions , @xmath45 , from the light @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath71,@xmath72 , including the vector bottonium : @xmath73 , @xmath74 and even the hypothetical exotic vector toponium states .",
    "all dynamical information is contained in the partial amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath59 , which are different for the different vector particles . on the opposite , some polarization phenomena have common characteristics , essentially independent from the type of vector meson .",
    "for example , vector mesons produced in @xmath5- and @xmath11-threshold collisions are transversally polarized , and the elements of the density matrix @xmath69 are independent from the relative values of the amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath59 : @xmath75 , @xmath76 . therefore , the angular distribution shows the @xmath77-dependence for the subsequent decay @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 is a pseudoscalar meson ) and the @xmath80-dependence for the decay @xmath81 , where @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is the angle between @xmath58 and the @xmath84 @xmath85 momentum ( in the rest system of @xmath86 ) .",
    "possible deviations from this behavior have to be considered as an indication of the presence of higher partial waves in the final state .",
    "all other one - spin polarization observables , related to the polarizations of the initial or final nucleons , identically vanish , for any process of @xmath68meson production .    the dependence of the differential cross section for threshold collisions of polarized nucleons ( where the polarization of the final particles is not detected ) can be parametrized as follows :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the axial vectors of the beam and target nucleon polarizations",
    ", @xmath90 is the element of phase - space for the three - particle final state .",
    "the spin correlation coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 are real and they are different for @xmath5- and @xmath11- collisions :    * @xmath93 : @xmath94 , @xmath95 . *",
    "@xmath96 : @xmath97 ,    with the following relations @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    defining @xmath100",
    "as the ratio of the total ( unpolarized ) cross section for @xmath11- and @xmath5- collisions , taking into account the identity of final particles in @xmath101 , we find :",
    "@xmath102 so the following relation holds : @xmath103    the polarization transfer from the initial neutron to the final proton ( @xmath104 ) , can be parameterized as follows : @xmath105 with a simple expression , which relates the real coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 to the partial amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath59 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the relative phase of @xmath63 and @xmath59 , which is non zero , in the general case .    for the process @xmath101 the relation @xmath110 holds , for any vector meson @xmath86 .",
    "the parameterization of the spin structure of the threshold matrix elements given above , is based on fundamental symmetry properties .",
    "it is therefore model independent and can be applied to any reaction mechanism . following the standard way in describing the nucleon - nucleon interaction",
    ", we will apply @xmath8channel @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 meson exchanges to @xmath4 production , too .",
    "such approach has been used to describe the production of light vector mesons such as @xmath3 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the reaction threshold for @xmath30 in the laboratory system ( lab ) is quite large .",
    "however , the formalism of pomeron exchange can not be applied here , even at such large energies , because the regge picture is valid when not only the initial energy is large , but also the excitation energy : the quantity @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 is the total energy ) has to be essentially larger than unity .",
    "another important kinematical variable is the momentum transfer squared , @xmath118 , where @xmath107 and @xmath119 are the four - momenta of the target and of the scattered nucleon . at threshold",
    ", one can find that the variable @xmath120 has only a fixed value , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the nucleon mass and @xmath123 is the @xmath68meson mass .",
    "so , for @xmath4-production this momentum is large : @xmath124 -3 gev@xmath125 , therefore all the propagators corresponding to the light mesons are of comparable magnitude ( @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath127 @xmath129 @xmath127 @xmath130 ) .",
    "in such situation it is not possible to justify the dominance of a particular exchange mechanism , so we have to conclude that threshold heavy @xmath46-meson production in nn - collisions is determined by the exchange of the coherent sum of many different mesons , with different masses .",
    "but what about the quantum numbers , @xmath131 , of these exchanges ( @xmath132 is the spin and @xmath79 is the parity of the corresponding meson ) ?",
    "we can use the parametrizations ( [ eq : mpp ] ) and ( [ eq : mnp ] ) , which are exact and model independent results , with definite selection rules , from the point of view of @xmath133-channel for @xmath45 to understand the @xmath8channel @xmath131-picture . using the fierz - transformations ( in two - component form ) ,",
    "let us rewrite the general parametrization of the matrix element , see eqs .",

    "( [ eq : fierz ] ) has a precise dynamical interpretation , as it corresponds to @xmath8channel meson exchange ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) with a definite spin and parity , @xmath131 .",
    "the first two terms describe a scalar exchange , where the spin structure @xmath135 ( in one vertex ) corresponds to the matrix element of the process @xmath136",
    "( @xmath137 is a virtual scalar meson ) at its threshold .",
    "the other vertex , corresponding to the @xmath138-interaction has a structure of the type @xmath139 .",
    "the last two terms describe the exchange by neutral pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath112 or @xmath113 ) with the @xmath140-spin structure of the matrix element for the subprocess @xmath141 at threshold , and with the @xmath142 structure for the vertex @xmath143 .",
    "the same considerations hold for the @xmath59-partial amplitude",
    ".    therefore we can conclude that @xmath120-channel exchanges with @xmath144 ( scalar mesons ) and @xmath145 ( pseudoscalar meson ) can be considered as the most probable mechanisms to describe the threshold dynamics of @xmath4-production in nn - collisions .",
    "let us consider these mechanisms in detail .",
    "the matrix element @xmath146 , corresponding to the two diagrams of fig .",

    "we used the following formula for the threshold energy of the initial nucleons , @xmath152 .",
    "the complex amplitudes",
    "@xmath153 and @xmath154 describe two possible threshold partial transitions in @xmath155 : @xmath156 and @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the orbital momentum of the initial @xmath159-system .",
    "one can find that : @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the partial amplitudes corresponding to the two possible values of the total angular momentum in @xmath163 .",

    "( [ eq : mnp ] ) and @xmath165 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms1 ] ) , one can see that only the amplitude @xmath154 has to be kept , because it generates transversally polarized @xmath68mesons .",
    "first of all , this means that the cross section of the processes @xmath164 and @xmath166 are determined by different contributions to the amplitudes @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "this follows from the following formula for the corresponding cross section : @xmath167 therefore these cross sections must be independent",
    ". moreover , both amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath59 , for @xmath164 in case of @xmath114-exchange , being proportional to @xmath154 , have to satisfy simple relations . in such case definite numerical values",
    "can be derived for the polarization observables in @xmath68meson production for @xmath33collisions . to prove this ,",
    "let us transform the matrix element ( [ eq : ms1 ] ) into the `` standard '' parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnp ] ) , in terms of definite quantum numbers of the @xmath133-channel : @xmath168,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : mppf ] ) ) .",
    "such transition is forbidden by the generalized pauli principle , following from the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction and should not appear in the total matrix element @xmath170 .",

    "note that here we use the same propagator as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms1 ] ) .",
    "this is correct in threshold conditions , because any different propagator will generate higher waves in the initial and final states .",
    "summing the two contributions in the matrix element , @xmath146 , the @xmath175 term corresponding to the triplet - triplet transition in @xmath164 is exactly cancelled : @xmath176 therefore , for @xmath177exchange , one finds : @xmath178 independently on the numerical values of the coupling constant @xmath150 and of the partial amplitude @xmath154 for the process @xmath179 , the polarization observables for the process @xmath164 and the ratio @xmath100 ( see eq .",

    "the @xmath113-exchange is characterized by two diagrams ( fig .",

    "these amplitudes correspond to to two allowed threshold partial transitions ( in @xmath187 ) : @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",

    "again , one can prove that only the sum @xmath195 generates the correct spin structure for threshold matrix element @xmath196 ( again taking into account the isotopic invariance for both vertexes of the considered diagrams : @xmath191 and @xmath197 , @xmath198 or @xmath199 ) : @xmath200 , \\label{eq : mppe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the following relation for the partial amplitudes for @xmath201 : @xmath202 and definite numerical predictions for the polarization phenomena and for the ratio @xmath100 : @xmath203 so , only the coefficient @xmath204 can discriminate between @xmath113- and @xmath114- exchanges .",
    "due to the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction , it is necessary to consider four feynman diagrams , corresponding to the exchange of neutral and charged pions in @xmath164 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . taking into account the isotopic relations between different coupling constants in @xmath206-vertexes and different amplitudes for the processes @xmath207 , one can find the following expressions for the amplitudes @xmath208 and @xmath209 : @xmath210 and the single amplitude @xmath208 for the process @xmath101 is equal to 2@xmath211 .",
    "note that the spin structure for the processes @xmath212 and @xmath213 has to be simpler .",
    "independently from the concrete model for the amplitude @xmath214 of the process @xmath212 , the relations ( [ eq : pop ] ) allow to predict definite values for the polarization observables and for the ratio @xmath100 : @xmath215 which are very different from the previous cases of pure @xmath114- or @xmath113-exchanges .      based on the above mentioned results for the different @xmath8channel exchanges ,",
    "we can build a more realistic model , combining the contributions of different mesons .",
    "as an example , let us consider the case of @xmath44-exchange , with the following expressions for the allowed threshold partial amplitudes @xmath59 and @xmath63 of the process @xmath164 : @xmath216 where the ratio @xmath217 characterizes the relative role of @xmath113- and @xmath205-exchanges in @xmath164 and @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , we can find the following results for the polarization observables in @xmath164 and for the ratio @xmath100 of the total cross section for @xmath219- and @xmath220-collisions : @xmath221 this primarily means that , in framework of the considered model , two independent parameters @xmath222 and @xmath223 enter in the definition of three observables .",
    "therefore a simultaneous measurement of @xmath224 and @xmath91 can determine uniquely @xmath225 and @xmath223 ( with the evident condition @xmath226 ) : @xmath227    the situation is simplified if the ratio @xmath228 is a real parameter .",

    ", the following quadratic relation between polarization observables @xmath224 and @xmath91 holds : @xmath234    after measuring of the ratio @xmath100 ( of total cross sections for @xmath33 and @xmath34 interactions ) it will be possible to find two different values for @xmath228 : @xmath235    knowing @xmath228 , it is straightforward to predict any polarization observable for the process @xmath164 .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath100 , @xmath91 and @xmath224 as a function of @xmath228 , ( when @xmath228 is real ) are shown in figs .",
    "one can see a strong dependence of the ratio @xmath100 from @xmath228 in the region @xmath236 , where @xmath237 , i.e. with strong isotopic effects .",
    "only for @xmath238 we have @xmath239 , with a weak dependence on the parameter @xmath228 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath224 show particular sensitivity to @xmath228 .",
    "the previous analysis is based on the most general properties of threshold vector meson production in @xmath23-collisions and @xmath120-channel exchanges . in the last case , we used only properties related to the quantum numbers of the corresponding @xmath120-channel mesons : spin , parity and isotopic spin .",
    "all previous results are valid for any isoscalar vector meson production , @xmath70 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 . the properties , which are specific to a definite @xmath86-meson reaction , appear first of all in the kinematics , in particular in the different @xmath86-meson masses , and in the values of the partial amplitudes for the binary subprocess , @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is a virtual meson ( with space - like four - momentum ) .",
    "so , for the considered @xmath242-model , all dynamical information , which is necessary for the calculations of such observables as @xmath100 , @xmath91 and @xmath224 , is contained in one complex parameter @xmath228 , which characterizes the ratio of the threshold amplitudes for @xmath229-processes .",

    "the ratio @xmath228 can be estimated from the following formula : @xmath271^{1/2}\\simeq \\displaystyle\\frac{g_{\\eta nn}}{g_{\\pi nn } } < 1\\ ] ] again the sign of @xmath228 can not be determined by such considerations , but , again the value of @xmath228 which has been derived is in the range where the ratio @xmath100 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath228 . note that the dependence of the polarization observables @xmath91 and @xmath224 is also quite large , in this region of @xmath228 .    in the previous considerations , the effects of the final state interaction in the produced @xmath272-three particle system",
    "were not taken into account . in the near threshold region ,",
    "the @xmath273interaction is well known , in terms of the corresponding scattering energies and effective radius .",
    "it is not the case for the @xmath274-interaction .",
    "note in this connection , that the total @xmath274-cross section is not presently well known @xcite .",
    "for example , photoproduction data give values of 3 - 4 mb @xcite , while the analysis of charmonium absorption on nucleons ( at relatively high momentum ) in @xmath275- and @xmath276-reactions suggests larger values , 6 - 7 mb @xcite .",
    "these larger values can be explained in the framework of effective lagrangian approaches @xcite .",
    "different methods have been suggested for a direct measurement of this quantity , through the processes @xmath277 @xcite , @xmath278 @xcite , and charmed meson production in @xmath279-collisions @xcite .",
    "note , that in the general case , it is necessary to define two different @xmath4-cross sections corresponding to transversal and longitudinal @xmath4-polarization .",
    "for example , the data about @xmath280 are sensitive to @xmath281-cross section , with transversal @xmath4-polarization , if the vdm hypothesis is correct .",
    "another possible method is to determine the average @xmath282-cross section , obtained by averaging over the @xmath4-polarization . in the case of interest here , the near - threshold @xmath4-production in nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath7 ,",
    "the possible effects of the @xmath274-interaction are given by the @xmath281-cross section alone , because we showed that the kinematical conditions are such that the @xmath4 is produced with transversal polarization , only . to avoid double counting in the calculation of the @xmath283 final interaction",
    ", one has to take into account only the @xmath283 interaction with a nucleon spectator , produced in the vertex @xmath284 .",
    "let us compare the cross sections for the @xmath3 and @xmath285- production in @xmath5-collisions - in the framework of the same approach , namely for @xmath205-exchange in @xmath1 and @xmath69-exchange for the subprocess @xmath207 , with @xmath286 or @xmath285 .",

    "this value is too small , when compared with the existing experimental value for the lowest @xmath302 gev , namely @xcite @xmath303 nb .",
    "note that the @xmath69-exchange model for @xmath304 gives a cross section one order of magnitude smaller in comparison with other possible theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "it is one possibility to explain the value of @xmath305 .",
    "another possibility is to take @xmath306 ^ 2\\simeq 10 $ ] , which can be plausible , because the @xmath307-system must have a smaller size in comparison with @xmath308 .",
    "this can be realized by the following form factor : @xmath309 with @xmath310 .",
    "let us summarize the main results concerning the theoretical analysis of @xmath4-production in nucleon - nucleon collisions in threshold regime .",
    "* we established the spin structure of the threshold matrix element in terms of a limited number of partial transitions , corresponding to @xmath36-wave production of final particles in the process @xmath7 . *",
    "we proved the essential role of isotopic effects for @xmath4-production in @xmath5- and @xmath11-collisions .",
    "the two reactions present very different characteristics concerning : * * the number of independent partial transitions , * * the spin structure of the threshold matrix elements , * * the value of the absolute cross sections , * * the polarization phenomena .",
    "+ note that all these differences are generated by a common mechanism : the origin of the essential difference has to be found in the different role of the pauli principle for @xmath5- and @xmath6-collisions in the near threshold region . *",
    "this model - independent analysis shows the universality of theoretical considerations of threshold production of different vector mesons in nucleon - nucleon collisions , starting from @xmath311 @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath3 to charmed mesons . *",
    "only one polarization observable , the @xmath4-polarization , is identical for @xmath5- and @xmath6-collisions : the @xmath4-meson is transversally polarized -even in collisions of unpolarized nucleons . the experimental determination of the ratio of the total cross sections for @xmath33 and @xmath34collisions is important for the identification of the reaction mechanism .",
    "polarization phenomena , which are trivial for threshold @xmath5-collisions , will be very useful for @xmath11-collisions .",
    "the polarization transfer coefficients show the largest sensitivity to the nature ( quantum numbers ) of @xmath8channel exchanges . * the existing experimental data on the specific decays of @xmath4 , such as @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 , @xmath315 ,",
    "constrain a possible model for the threshold @xmath4-production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "these data show , in a transparent way , the link between the possible reaction mechanisms on one side , and the physics of @xmath4-decays in usual hadrons ( @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath205 , @xmath69 ... ) , on the other side .",
