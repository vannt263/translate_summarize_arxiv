    "our galaxy and other nearby galaxies contain a multitude of x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "observations of sources in the milky way and local group galaxies show that many of the brightest x - ray sources are high and low mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb , lmxb ) , but there are also sources associated with supernova remnants ( snr ) and hii regions . for example , the rosat survey of m31 @xcite revealed a total of 560 x - ray sources , 16 of which have been optically identified with supernova remnants and 33 with globular clusters .",
    "most of the bulge sources in m31 have been identified on the basis of their x - ray spectra as low mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "studies of x - ray populations in a wide range of galaxies is potentially very valuable .",
    "for example , since x - ray binaries are products of the end point of stellar evolution , the x - ray binary population should be related to the history of star formation in each galaxy @xcite",
    ". however , the resolution of _ einstein _ , rosat and asca was not sufficient to allow identification of sources in galaxies beyond the local group .",
    "_ chandra _  has the angular resolution necessary to study the x - ray source population in more distant galaxies for the first time @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare x - ray populations of a sample of disk and bulge galaxies .",
    "we show that there is a highly significant difference in the x - ray colors of sources in bulge and disk systems .",
    "disk galaxies have a population of soft sources and a population of hard sources not seen in bulges .",
    "x - ray colors are known to be a sensitive discriminator of source type @xcite and we interpret these differences as differences in the source population .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that x - ray colors derived from _ chandra _  observations can be used to identify different classes of x - ray sources in nearby galaxies . in section",
    "[ anal ] we describe our data analysis . in section  [ sec : b_and_d ] we show the difference in the distribution of x - ray colors in bulge and disk systems and in section  [ sec : id ] we suggest a classification scheme based on colors . in section  [ sec : abs ] we discuss the effects of absorption on source classification , and in section  [ sec : lvsd ] we discuss the spatial distribution , luminosities and variability characteristics of the different classes of sources .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : s_and_c ] we summarize our results and give suggestions for further work .",
    "our sample for this study consists of 2 late - type face - on spiral galaxies ( m101 and m83 ) and 3 elliptical / bulge systems ( ngc 4697 , the inner bulge of m31 and the bulge of ngc 1291 ) .",
    "observations of all galaxies were performed on the back - illuminated acis - s3 ccd .",
    "all analysis was performed using the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations software package ( _ ciao _ ) v2.2.1 and the _ chandra _  calibration database v2.10 .",
    "data were screened for times of high background , as many of the observations occurred near periods of solar activity .",
    "exposure times of the screened observations are in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "source lists were constructed using _ wavdetect _",
    "@xcite , the mexican - hat wavelet source detection routine which is part of _",
    "ciao_. we ran _",
    "wavdetect _ on 0.3 - 6.5 kev band images using wavelet scales of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 pixels .",
    "this combination of energy band and wavelet scales yielded the fewest spurious detections and found all visually obvious point sources .",
    "the default value of the parameter sigthresh ( @xmath0 ) was used to identify source pixels .",
    "the output source regions were visually inspected to identify multiple detections and single sources detected twice .",
    "nuclear sources were removed from the source lists .",
    "sources outside of the acis - s3 chip were excluded from further analysis .",
    "sources outside the optical boundaries of the galaxy , defined as the observed diameter at 25 mag arcsec@xmath1 in the blue band , @xmath2 , were also excluded , since these have a high probability of being background objects .",
    "values for @xmath2 were taken from @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : prop ] gives the total number of sources detected in each galaxy with minimum of 20 net counts and significance @xmath34@xmath4 ( see section  [ sec : b_and_d ] ) and the expected number of background sources ( same significance ) from the logn - logs curves of @xcite .",
    "variations in the number of background sources with position on the sky @xcite will change the number of expected background sources by at most a factor of 3 .",
    "the total number of counts for each detected source were calculated in 3 bands : the soft band ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) , medium band ( 1 - 2kev ) and hard band ( 2 - 8kev ) .",
    "counts were extracted from source regions determined by 4-@xmath4 source ellipses from _ wavdetect_. this over - estimates the source size , but the contribution from background is negligible .",
    "the background region for each source was taken to be an ellipse with major and minor axes equal to 4 times the source axes and excluding the source region and any other overlapping source regions .",
    "background ellipse radii were not allowed to exceed 50 pixels ( about 25 ) to avoid contamination from variations in the diffuse emission .",
    "source count rates were corrected using monochromatic exposure maps created for each band using a monochromatic response at the mean photon energy in each band : 0.65 kev ( soft band ) , 1.5 kev ( medium band ) and 5 kev ( hard band ) .",
    "these maps take into account vignetting and spatial variation of the ccd qe .",
    "x - ray colors were then calculated for each source as : @xmath5 ( soft ) , and @xmath6 ( hard ) , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the counts in the soft , medium and hard bands respectively , and @xmath10 is the total counts in all three bands combined .",
    "we estimated fluxes from each source assuming a 5  kev thermal bremsstrahlung model with photoelectric absorption .",
    "the @xmath11 was fixed at the galactic value .",
    "no correction for absorption in the host galaxy was applied .",
    "luminosities were derived in the 0.3 - 8 kev band using distances from the nearby galaxies catalog ( tully , 1988 ) , which assumes @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 coupled with a virgo infall model . a more detailed description of the data analysis , discussing the relevant biases and presenting source lists with spectral and timing results will be presented in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : m31_and_m101 ] shows the x - ray color - color diagram for sources in the inner bulge of m31 and the disk of m101 .",
    "only sources with a minimum of 20 net counts and significance @xmath34@xmath4 are plotted and used in subsequent analysis .",
    "there is a clear difference in the colors of sources in m31 and m101 .",
    "the bulge sources in m31 are clustered in a relatively narrow color range , with both h1 and h2 having values between -0.4 and 0.4 .",
    "the m101 disk sources , on the other hand , have a tail of soft sources extending to @xmath14 .",
    "m101 also has a population of sources with @xmath15 , not seen in m31 .",
    "it is important to note that the m31 exposure is deeper than the m101 observation ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) .",
    "the approximate luminosity limit for sources with @xmath16 counts in m31 is nearly a factor of two lower than for sources in m101 .",
    "hence if the `` extra '' soft and hard sources existed in m31 they should have been detected .",
    "figure  [ fig : b_and_d ] shows the x - ray color - color diagram for sources drawn from a larger sample of galaxies ( the bulges of m31 and ngc 1291 , the elliptical galaxy ngc 4697 and the disk galaxies m83 and m101 . )",
    "the sources were selected according to the criteria described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the color differences between disk and bulge sources are in this larger sample is very clear , and highly significant . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives the probability that the two data sets arise from the same distribution as @xmath17 ( soft color ) and @xmath18 ( hard color ) .",
    "the differences in the colors between bulge and disk sources indicates a difference in the source population , and can be used classify the sources in different systems .",
    "while it is impossible to classify any individual source with confidence on the basis of x - ray colors alone , it is valuable to be able to separate sources in a statistical sense for population studies .    as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , the bulge of our galaxy and m31 as well as sources in elliptical galaxies are dominated by low mass x - ray binaries @xcite . we therefore suggest that the region of the x - ray color - color diagram populated by `` bulge '' sources contains many lmxbs .",
    "the `` bulge '' sources are in a region of the diagram characterized by a simple power law slope ( photon index 1 - 2.5 ) with some intrinsic ( to the source ) absorption .",
    "this is typical of lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the `` lmxb '' region is best defined in figure  [ fig : xcol_lmxbonly ] . by cross - correlating our m31 inner bulge source list with the list given by @xcite we have rejected known foreground and background sources , supersoft sources , and sources for which there may be a contribution from hot gas ( e.g. those associated with planetary nebula ) .",
    "the resulting plot is illustrative of the intrinsic dispersion in the color - color diagram of lmxbs .",
    "very few of the soft or hard sources described in section  [ sec : b_and_d ] and associated with disk regions are likely to be lmxbs .",
    "the lmxb area is shown in figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] also shows the predicted colors of power - law spectra with increasing photon index ( blue arc ) .",
    "the effect of adding absorption to a simple power law is illustrated with the vertically rising blue lines .",
    "the soft sources ( @xmath19 between -0.4 and -0.9 ) which appear almost exclusively in disks may be identified as thermal supernova remnants .",
    "supernova remnants are found in regions of on - going star formation , and hence very few are found in elliptical galaxies .",
    "thermal supernova remnants also have soft spectra @xcite consistent with the colors seen here .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] .",
    "the purple boxes show the colors of several known thermal supernova remnants in the small magellenic cloud with spectra measured by asca @xcite .",
    "most of these sources lie below the `` lmxb '' region , in the part of the diagram populated by by soft sources .",
    "one absorbed snr has @xmath20 .",
    "additional evidence that these sources are indeed thermal snr comes from a detailed study of the discrete source population in m83 by @xcite .",
    "they find that two of the brightest soft sources have x - ray spectra dominated by emission lines , typical of snr .",
    "however , it is important to stress that some of these soft disk sources may be absorbed supersoft sources ( see discussion below . ) snr dominated by non - thermal emission ( crab - like objects ) may also contribute to the source population .",
    "these will have spectra somewhet harder than thermal snr , and will probably be located in the `` lmxb '' or `` absorbed sources '' part of the diagram .",
    "there are a handful of sources with @xmath210 , which appear in the disks but not in the bulges",
    ". the most natural interpretation of these sources is that they are high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries have high mass ( hence short lived ) secondaries and are typically found in regions of active star formation .",
    "they are known to have hard spectra in the 1 - 10 kev region , with a power - law photon index of 1 - 2 , and often high variable intrinsic absorption @xcite .",
    "the green circles in figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] show the colors of known binary pulsars observed by asca @xcite .",
    "as noted above , most known hmxbs are associated with pulsars in binary systems .",
    "therefore , the hmxbs shown in figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] represent only pulsed ( neutron star ) binaries and not black hole binaries with early - type companions .",
    "these sources have spectra similar to black hole lmxb companions @xcite , and probably are not well separated from black hole lmxb sources in the color - color diagram .",
    "there are a small number of sources with h2=0 and h1=-1 .",
    "these sources essentially have no counts above 1kev , and some are undoubtedly classical supersoft sources @xcite .",
    "these `` supersoft '' sources seem to occur in both bulge and disk systems .",
    "they are frequently brighter than the sources identified as supernova remnants , and most are variable ( see section  [ sec : lvsd ] ) .",
    "@xcite have identified 10 sources in m101 as supersoft .",
    "we do not include 6 of these fainter sources because they have less than 20 counts .",
    "we detect the remaining four sources , three of which have @xmath22 and one of which has @xmath23 .",
    "it is also possible that some ( or even all ) of the soft sources identified as thermal snr are absorbed supersoft sources .",
    "absorption will decrease the flux in the lowest energy _",
    "chandra _  band , shifting the soft color vertically upwards on the color - color plot ( see also  [ sec : abs ] ) .",
    "if this is the case , we have identified a new population of faint , absorbed , accretion - powered soft sources in disk galaxies , probably associated with the young stellar population .",
    "we favor the hypothesis that the soft source population is dominated by snr , but a new population of accretion - powered soft sources can not be ruled out .",
    "an in - depth study of the variability and spectral characteristics of the soft sources ( see section  [ sec : lvsd ] ) is required to distinguish between these two models .",
    "there will undoubtedly be some overlap in source type in the color - color diagram , both because different sources have intrinsically similar spectra ( e.g. black hole binaries with high and low mass companions ) and because of absorption .",
    "photons in the lowest energy _",
    "chandra _  band will be preferentially removed in an absorbed source , making @xmath19 `` harder '' .",
    "this will move the source vertically up the color - color diagram , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] .",
    "when the absorption becomes very severe ( @xmath24 ) photons in the medium _ chandra _  band will also be removed , causing @xmath25 to become harder .",
    "the source will then curve to the right in figure  [ fig : xcol_models ] , as shown by the tracks of increasing absorption .",
    "absorption will cause supersoft sources to be confused with snr , move snr into the lmxb region of the diagram , and blur the distinction between lmxbs and hmxbs .",
    "color information in the _ chandra _  bands will be very limited for highly inclined galaxies , where essentially all low energy photons are lost . in this case",
    ", sources distinguished primarily on the basis of their soft color will be confused ( snr , supersoft sources , lmxbs ) , and only a very rough separation on the basis of hard color will be possible .",
    "the soft sources identified in section  [ sec : id ] as supernova remnants have considerably less scatter in their luminosities than do sources with @xmath26 - 0.6  i.e. a higher fraction of the sources in the lmxb part of the diagram have luminosities @xmath27 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : colors_lumin ] .",
    "the left panel shows the soft x - ray color plotted as a function of luminosity for m101 and m83 .",
    "this difference in the distribution of luminosities in lmxb and `` soft '' sources is significant ; a ks test gives the probability that they are drawn from the same distribution as @xmath28 .",
    "the larger scatter in the luminosities of sources with @xmath29 is naturally explained if many of these objects are accreting binaries .",
    "binaries can reach much higher luminosities ( especially in a flare state ) than is typically observed in evolved snr ( @xmath30-@xmath31 erg s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the soft sources are typical of brighter snr ; there are certainly other soft sources below our detection threshold .",
    "several of the brightest soft sources have very extreme colors ( h1=-1 ) and have colors and luminosities characteristic of supersoft sources @xcite .",
    "these are probably accretion powered .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : colors_lumin ] shows the luminosity plot for x - ray hard color .",
    "this plot suggests that sources with the hardest colors ( @xmath32 0.2 , hmxb candidates ) have smaller scatter than less extreme sources .",
    "a k - s test shows that the luminosity distributions of the hardest sources is significantly different from those in the lmxb part of the diagram ( the probability that they are drawn from the same distribution is @xmath33 .",
    "the luminosity function of lmxb sources in the milky way extends to higher luminosities than the hmxb luminosity function @xcite , consistent with what is observed here .",
    "we note , however , that extremely luminous sources tentatively associated with hmxbs are seen in starburst galaxies @xcite .    if the soft sources discussed in section  [ sec :",
    "id ] are supernova remnants , they should show little or no evidence for variability .",
    "when snr are young ( @xmath34 1000 years ) several emission mechanisms might contribute to the x - ray emission , and the flux may be variable @xcite . however , once the remnant enters the adiabatic phase the luminosity should decline gradually @xcite .",
    "in contrast , accretion - powered supersoft sources are known to be variable ( @xcite , and detection of variability in a large fraction of the soft sources would support the hypothesis that they are accretion - powered .",
    "both m101 and m83 have one deep exposure in the _ chandra _  archive , with a second shorter observation ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) . the second shorter exposure of m83",
    "was taken 16 months after the first , and the second exposure of m101 taken 7 months after the first . in the long ( 100ks )",
    "pointing of m101 there are 28 soft sources ( potential snrs ) detected .",
    "most of these have 20 - 100 counts and are not detected in the short ( 10ks ) observation .",
    "this does not provide very stringent constraints on the variability of the soft sources , since to be detected in the short observation they would have to increase in flux by factors of 5 - 10 .",
    "there are two `` soft '' sources detected in both the long and short observation .",
    "one source with @xmath35 shows no evidence for variability .",
    "another source is significantly variable , and has a @xmath36 in the long observation .",
    "this source has a luminosity of @xmath37 erg s@xmath13 , and is the brightest object in m101 ( source 98 from @xcite ) .",
    "it is highly variable and is clearly an accretion source .",
    "two `` hard '' ( possible hmxb ) sources are detected in both observations in m101 .",
    "one has @xmath38 in the long observation and shows no evidence for variability .",
    "one source has @xmath39 , and the flux approximately doubles in the second observation .",
    "there are 28 soft ( possible snr ) sources detected in m83 in the long ( 50ks ) observation .",
    "a total of 7 sources with soft colors that were detected in the long observation were also detected in the short observation .",
    "two of these are clearly variable , while the remaining 5 have approximately constant flux .",
    "of the 28 soft sources detected in the long observation , 5 sources should have been detected in the short ( 10ks ) observation , assuming no variability .",
    "three of these have extremely soft colors , are clearly variable and are probably supersoft sources .",
    "the remaining two sources may have declined in flux between the two observations .",
    "three hard ( potentially hmxb sources ) were detected in the long observation of m83 .",
    "one of these sources may be variable .",
    "we conclude that we have insufficient data to make definitive statements about the variability properties of the soft sources in either m83 or m101 .    the spatial distribution of the soft ( yellow x s ) and `` lmxb '' ( red x s ) sources is shown in figure  [ fig : opt_and_x - ray ] for m83 .",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray image is shown on the left , and the u - band optical image on the right . both `` lmxb '' and",
    "soft sources have a tendency to occur in the spiral arms .",
    "the main difference between the two distributions , however , is that the nuclear x - ray sources are almost all sources with `` lmxb '' colors . in m101",
    "the x - ray sources follow a similar pattern ( see also @xcite ) with both types of sources following the spiral structure .",
    "there is only a single diffuse source at the center of m101 ( there is essentially no bulge in this system ) so segregation of central sources is not seen .",
    "in this paper , we show that there is a highly significant difference in the x - ray colors of sources in bulge and disk systems .",
    "disk galaxies have an additional population of soft x - ray sources and a scattering of hard sources not seen in bulge systems .",
    "the hard disk sources are probably hmxbs .",
    "the soft disk sources are probably dominated by snr , but we can not rule out a contribution from a new population of soft , faint , absorbed accretion sources associated with the young stellar population .    the differences in x - ray colors of sources in nearby disk and bulge galaxies can be used as a starting point for source classification , with the color - color diagram approximately separating snr , lmxb and hmxb sources .",
    "these conclusions are strengthened by the location of known thermal snrs and binary pulsars in the x - ray color - color diagram .",
    "the luminosities of sources identified as snr and hmxbs are consistent with what is observed in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the variability characteristics of different classes of sources should provide additional constraints on their nature .",
    "accreting binaries are likely to vary stochastically while the flux from thermal snr should remain constant .",
    "unfortunately , although there are two _ chandra _  observations for both disk galaxies ( m101 and m83 ) the second observations are not deep enough to effectively constrain the variability of the soft sources identified as snr .",
    "it is not possible to identify a source on the basis of x - ray color alone .",
    "however , separating sources on the basis of x - ray colors will be very valuable for population studies .",
    "although x - ray colors provide an excellent starting point for the classification of sources in nearby galaxies , there is some overlap in source type in the x - ray color - color diagram .",
    "for example , supernova remnants which are very highly absorbed will move vertically upwards into the `` lmxb '' part of the color - color diagram .",
    "the population of soft sources may contain some supersoft sources or x - ray binaries with soft spectra .",
    "therefore other information such as source variability , luminosity , and optical counterparts as well as position within the galaxy must be used to complete the classification process .",
    "deeper _ chandra _  images of nearby galaxies are required to investigate the variability and spectral properties of the different source classes outlined here .",
