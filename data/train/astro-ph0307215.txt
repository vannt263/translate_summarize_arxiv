    "a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system consists of a neutron star ( ns ) which accretes matter through roche lobe overflow from an evolved low - mass secondary star .",
    "4u 1728 - 34 has been recognized as a classical lmxb because it exhibits a wide range of observational characteristics which are attributed to lmxbs [ see e. g. @xcite ] . in particular , it exhibits regular thermonuclear explosions of accreted matter on the ns surface [ type i x - ray bursts , see @xcite for the latest review ] .",
    "high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpo ) in persistent emission [ @xcite ] , and 363 hz burst oscillation [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter vs01 ] were revealed in burst emission from 4u 1728 - 34 using fourier analysis of the high time - resolution rxte data .",
    "so far , no optical counterpart for this x - ray source has been found .",
    "although 4u 1728 - 34 is believed to be located several kiloparsecs from the earth , no accurate estimation of the distance to the source is currently available .",
    "the theory of x - ray spectral formation during the expansion and contraction stages of the bursts was developed in @xcite and @xcite , hereafter t94 and st02 respectively .",
    "this theory was first applied to exosat data in @xcite , hereafter ht95 , for the lmxbs 4u 1705 - 44 and 4u 1820 - 30 . in @xcite ,",
    "hereafter ts02 , three bursts from cyg x-2 were analyzed . in this work",
    "we employ the methodology , developed in ts02 to analyze a set of 26 bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 , previously analyzed in vs01 to search for burst oscillations . compared with cyg x-2 ( ts02 ) ,",
    "the 4u 1728 - 34 burst data have the advantage of high quality counting statistics as well as a larger number of burst events .",
    "a brief description of the data used in the analysis is given in  2 .",
    "we present the model and the results of its application to the burst data of 4u 1728 - 34 in  3 . specifically",
    ", we obtain the dependence of the ns mass on the radius as error contours , calculated for the set of distances to the system taken from reasonable interval . in ",
    "4 we offer an evolution scenario for the ns - accretion disk geometry , which can explain the existing controversy between the eddington limit for the peak flux and the flux behavior during the bursts with radial expansion @xcite . in ",
    "4 we also present estimates for the inclination angle of the system . we discuss our results and come to conclusions  in   5 .",
    "we analyzed the data collected by the proportional counter array , ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the main instrument on board the _ rxte_. generous amount ( @xmath2 1100 ksec ) of _ rxte _ observational time was devoted to 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "more than 70 bursts were detected . for our analysis",
    "we selected the subset of bursts based on statistical equivalence and pca data configuration homogeneity , namely , when all five detectors of pca are operational and detailed spectral analysis on a subsecond time scale is possible .",
    "the selected events occurred during three periods : 15 march - 1 february 1996 ( proposal i d 10073 ) , 19 september - 1 october 1997 ( proposal i d 20083 ) , and 28 february - 10 june 1999 ( proposal i d 40027 ) .",
    "a total of 26 type i bursts were selected .",
    "due to its exotic nature we excluded the second burst detected on 26 september 1997 ( observation i d 20083 - 01 - 04 - 00 , burst 19 according vs01 numbering ) .",
    "we extract spectral slices from the burst catcher mode for consecutive 0.125 sec time intervals for each burst .",
    "we obtain the spectrum of the persistent emission using a 300 - 500 second time interval prior to a particular burst and we input resulting spectra as a background to distinguish the burst radiation component .",
    "we use fixed hydrogen column of @xmath3 provided by heasarc to model galactic absorption .",
    "the dead - time corrections is applied to all spectra .",
    "we fit the burst emission component using a blackbody model .",
    "this is justified because the x - ray burst spectrum deviates from the blackbody - like shape only in the soft part @xmath4 kev ( t94 and st02 ) .",
    "the quality of the fits is quite good for all spectra except the particular contraction episodes when the luminosity is very close to the eddington and the photospheric radius changes rapidly along with the outgoing spectrum shape .",
    "we calculate model flux between 0.01 and 100 kev .",
    "errors for parameter estimations from spectral fits are calculated for 68% ( 1@xmath5 ) confidence level . for the interpretation of the spectral fit results we utilized the theoretical model for the color temperature of the spectra from the burst cooling phase .",
    "the underlying formalism is developed in t94 and ts02 .",
    "here we present the final formula for the color temperature @xmath6(see eqs .",
    "7 - 8 in ts02 ) @xmath7^{-1}\\}^{1/4}{\\rm kev}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the ns mass in units of solar mass , @xmath9 is the ns radius in units of 10 km , @xmath10 is the helium abundance , @xmath11 is the dimensionless luminosity in units of the eddington luminosity .",
    "@xmath12 is the color ( hardening ) factor , which depends on @xmath13 , and @xmath10 ( ts02 )",
    ". parameters of the model are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 - distance to the object in units of 10 kpc .",
    "the dimensionless luminosity ( eddington ratio ) is expressed by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an anisotropy factor , @xmath17 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath19 ) is the observed bolometric flux",
    ". equations ( [ kt ] ) and ( [ dimlum ] ) describe the functional dependence of the observed @xmath6 on the observed flux @xmath20 for the set of input parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 . in the next section we put forth the ns - accretion disk geometry scenario and infer the behavior of @xmath16 during a burst with radial expansion . in this proposed scenario , the transition from the expansion stage to the decay stage",
    "is described graphically on the upper panel of figure [ geometry ] . at the beginning of the decay stage ,",
    "immediately after the expansion stage ends , the entire star is exposed to the observer .",
    "we do not need any correction due to the system geometry , which means that @xmath21 in this case . then at some moment @xmath22 accretion disk recedes ( reaches the star surface ) and a certain part of the ns is obscured by the disk for the observer .",
    "the anisotropy factor @xmath23 that quantitatively takes into account this occultation effect is more than one in this case . in terms of functional dependence of @xmath24 upon",
    "@xmath20 the flux domain consists of three intervals . for @xmath25 the entire star is open and @xmath21 .",
    "the flux level @xmath26 from the ns surface is related to the star - disk position when the lower ns hemisphere starts to get covered by the disk . through the decay stage",
    "the temperature should be calculated using formulae ( [ kt ] ) and ( [ dimlum ] ) where @xmath27 .",
    "thus the model formulated in this way acquires two more parameters , the anisotropy factor during occultation @xmath23 and dimensionless flux @xmath28 at the moment when occultation occurs .",
    "our analysis shows that constant values of these parameters for all bursts with radial expansion are consistent with observations .",
    "we use @xmath29 that is estimated using the expansion stage evolution ( see   4 ) .",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath30 does not significantly depend on the distance either .",
    "we combine fluxes and temperatures for all 26 bursts and fit the model to the the entire data set in the range @xmath31 , which approximately corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "we use the lower limit to exclude the data points with large errors .",
    "we put the upper limit on @xmath13 because of the restricted validity of the model for @xmath33 where expansion of the atmosphere can occur .",
    "we use a set of values for the distance between 4 and 5 kpc .",
    "we found that our analytical model gives statistically acceptable fit only when @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , for lower @xmath10 the slope of the model color temperature dependence on @xmath20 is steeper than that is dictated by the data ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the model with hydrogen - reach gas composition fails to describe the data , particularly , due to the strong dependence of the hardening factor on the eddington ratio @xmath13 .",
    "a given change in flux represents a larger change in the eddington ratio in an @xmath35-atmosphere than that in an @xmath36-atmosphere because the value of @xmath37 is smaller for an @xmath35-atmosphere .",
    "we consider this fact as a strong argument for ns atmosphere in 4u 1728 - 34 to be helium dominated and further we assume @xmath38 during the whole proceeding analysis . in figure 2",
    "we present the data and the best - fit model for the case of @xmath39 for which we obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 km .",
    "the best - fit values of ns mass and radius and error contours for 68% , 90% and 99% confidence levels are obtained for each fit and they are presented in table 1 and figure [ contours ] .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is 1418 and thus the acceptable fits must satisfy the condition that @xmath42 .",
    "this condition is not satisfied for distances higher than 5 kpc for which @xmath43 grows very rapidly .",
    "this fact suggests that probability for ns mass to be higher than 1.6 @xmath44 is very low . the dashed line in figure [ contours ] presents the dependence of the inner disk radius @xmath45 on the ns mass @xmath8 , derived for 4u 1728 - 34 using the transition layer model ( tlm ) for qpos detected in the persistent state from lmxbs @xcite : @xmath46 .",
    "our values of the ns radius are in good agreement with the tlm . based both on this fact and on statistical behavior of the model",
    "we can conclude _ that 4.5 - 5.0 kpc is the most probable interval for the distance to the source , that relates to 8.7 - 9.7 km and 1.2 - 1.6 @xmath0 ranges for @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . _",
    "we investigate the temporal evolution of the burst atmosphere photospheric radius for each individual burst in the manner similar to ts02 and ht95 . choosing particular values of distance and ns mass ( obtained from the model fit ) we find the radius [ i.e. solve equation ( 7 ) of ts02 ] for each spectral slice .",
    "the evolution of the ns photospheric radius during the burst event is shown in figure [ geometry ] for the case of @xmath39 .",
    "we present radius ( diamonds ) and observed flux ( empty circles ) values versus time for burst 9 , according to the vs01 numbering convention ( observation i d 10073 - 01 - 06 - 00 ) .",
    "the data were rebinned with 0.25 second time resolution for presentation purpose .",
    "filled circles represent the red - shift - corrected flux for each data point . this red - shift recalculated flux , is the flux which would be detected by an observer situated on the ns photosphere .",
    "restoration of the red - shift corrected flux reveals distinctive features which are barely seen in the observed flux behavior . after the initial rise of the burst , the flux levels off and stays constant for more than a second while the radius increases gradually .",
    "after the radius reaches its maximum , a second rise in the flux occurs .",
    "the flux reaches its maximum value when radius begins to fall quickly in contrast to the initial flux plateau .",
    "after that , flux decays exponentially , indicating the end of the expansion stage , and radius levels off .",
    "the above analysis clearly indicates that the flux emitted in the direction of the earth , ( when measured locally at the ns surface ) , is not constant throughout the expansion stage .",
    "this behavior of the burst peak flux was found to be common for many bursters [ see vs01 , @xcite ] . if the system geometry remains unchanged , the mentioned flux behavior is in contradiction with the eddington limit for the radiation power from a stellar atmosphere .",
    "we argue that the expanded burst envelope interacts strongly with the inner accretion disk .",
    "the evolution of the system geometry through the burst event is displayed in the upper part of figure [ geometry ] .",
    "before the burst the accretion disk extends down to the surface of ns ( stage a ) , _ covering the lower part of the ns , which is not exposed to the earth observer_. then the burst starts and the atmosphere expands ( stage b ) . at this moment , the inner part of the disk is swept away by the burst radiation pressure in excess of eddington flux .",
    "this stage corresponds to the initial plateau of the red - shift corrected flux versus time .",
    "after the photosphere begins to contract , the second rise in the red - shift corrected flux starts , effectively indicating that _ the lower ns hemisphere appears from behind the accretion disk_. indeed , the free fall velocity is much higher than the radial propagation velocity component in the disk . after the touchdown of the burst envelope",
    ", the ns - disk configuration corresponds to the case ( c ) .",
    "we assume that the red - shift corrected flux obtained for geometry ( b ) is the critical ( upper limit ) hemisphere flux . obviously , the red - shift corrections depend on the ns mass and radius . using the standard disk theory @xcite",
    "one can estimate the expansion stage duration required for sufficient disk material evacuation as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is efficiency of the radial momentum transfer , @xmath51 is the mass accretion rate in units of critical mass flux value and @xmath52 is a burst flux fraction transformed into the potential energy of ambient gas ( see e.g. st02 ) . for burst sources the persistent mass accretion rate in the disk",
    "is believed to be @xmath53 [ see e. g. @xcite ] .",
    "values for @xmath54 are widely used in the astrophysical community for lmxb . under these assumptions it takes only a small fraction of a second ( @xmath55 s ) to push the inner disk edge out , while observed expansion episodes of strong bursts from 4u 1728 - 34 usually last more than a second .",
    "this simple estimate suggests that the expanded ns atmosphere effectively push accretion disk outward .",
    "as long as the total ns luminosity during expansion stage ( the eddington luminosity ) is constant the observed radiation flux is higher in geometry ( c ) than in ( a ) and ( b ) . assuming that the ns radiates at the eddington limit , the ratio of fluxes detected from the direction at inclination angle @xmath56 from the normal to the accretion disk in geometries ( b ) and ( c ) is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are starcentric coordinates",
    ", @xmath60 and @xmath61 describes the angular intensity distribution law ( see sobolev 1975 for details ) .",
    "the tilde denotes the fact that value of flux was corrected for redshift . for the burst , presented in figure [ geometry ]",
    ", we have @xmath62 erg/@xmath63 and @xmath64 erg/@xmath63 . assuming @xmath65 const ( the lambert law ) , we obtain which leads to an estimate of the inclination angle @xmath66 .",
    "this result is also close to that for the chandrasekhar angular distribution , @xmath67 ) .",
    "we can apply the value of @xmath68 for the quantitative assessment of the distance to the source .",
    "the peak of the red - shift corrected flux @xmath68 corresponds to the state when the burst atmosphere subsides on the ns surface .",
    "the anisotropy factor is estimated as @xmath69 .",
    "we use this value as the anisotropy factor @xmath23 in the a - geometry .",
    "in this _ letter _ we offer a sophisticated analysis of the burst expansion events .",
    "accounting for the general relativistic ( gr ) effects reveals the dynamics and geometry of the ns - disk system and consistently explains the controversy between theory and the behavior observed during the expansion episodes of x - ray bursts . as a direct outcome of the proposed geometric scenario",
    "we obtain the distance and estimate the inclination angle of the system .",
    "the derived mass - radius relation depends on the assumed anisotropy .",
    "for example , without taking into account of anisotropy , @xmath21 ( conventual approach ) we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 km for @xmath72 kpc while accurate anisotropy corrections implemented in  3 result in @xmath73 and @xmath74 km .",
    "the statistical behavior of our model clearly rules out values of helium abundance lower than 0.9 .",
    "we could not find the set of model parameters including the distance that would give an acceptable value of @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the lower values of helium abundance gives much steeper temperature versus flux functional dependence than it is dictated by the data .",
    "furthermore , in earlier observations of 4u 1728 - 34 basinska et al . ( 1984 ) found that helium was probably the main source of nuclear fuel for the bursts and that any contribution from hydrogen was small .",
    "our data analysis confirms the results of basinska et al . and gives another argument for a helium - reach atmosphere in 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "our results also favor the soft eoss [ @xcite ] .",
    "we conclude that ( 1 ) the application of our analytical model to the data leads to the determination of the ns mass and radius as a function of the distance to the system . for the range of allowed distances 4.5 - 5.0 kpc",
    "we obtain rather narrow constrains for the ns radius in 8.7 - 9.7 km range and wide interval 1.2 - 1.6 @xmath0 for ns mass ( see also discussion in ts02 and strohmayer & bildsten 2003 ) ; ( 2 ) the consistent evolution scenario for the ns - accretion disk geometry , which explains the variation of the peak flux during the radial expansion stage ; ( 3 ) our geometrical model enables us to estimate ; the inclination angle of the system to @xmath66 with respect to the earth observer .",
