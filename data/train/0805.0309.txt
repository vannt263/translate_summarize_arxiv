    "@xcite also showed ( in less detail ) that substructure can affect lens time delays , but he focused on this as a source of noise in lensing measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "we instead propose that time delay perturbations provide a new way to detect and study substructure itself , if lens time delays can be measured well enough .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to exploring how time delay perturbations depend on the subhalo population . to that end , we start with a simple case in which all the subhalos are point masses with @xmath119 , and the substructure mass fraction is @xmath86 . for each substructure realization",
    "we compute the time delays between the images ; we then repeat the process @xmath120 times and make histograms of the time delays , as shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] . for each image pair",
    ", the average time delay matches the prediction of the reference smooth model very well , which makes sense because the smooth model can be thought of as an average over the subhalo population .",
    "these three time delay histograms appear to be gaussian .",
    "( the histogram of the time delay between the close images m2 and s1 is somewhat different , as discussed in section [ sec : ordering ] . )",
    "we attribute the gaussianity to the central limit theorem : the lens potential is a sum of many random terms , and such a sum tends toward a gaussian distribution if the mean and variance of each term are finite , which we verify in the appendix .",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath1210.26 days for all three image pairs shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "next we consider the effects of changing the subhalo mass ( figure  [ fig : hist - m ] ) and the substructure mass fraction ( figure  [ fig : hist - f ] ) . in order to place different image pairs on a common scale ,",
    "we plot histograms of the time delay perturbation @xmath122 , defined to be the difference between the time delay with substructure and the time delay for the reference smooth model .",
    "all of the histograms appear to be nicely gaussian , to be centered on zero , and to have widths that increase with both the subhalo mass and the substructure mass fraction .",
    "we can quantify this last point by plotting the time delay scatter @xmath123 as a function of the subhalo mass , for different values of the substructure mass fraction , as shown in figure  [ fig : mscaling ] . in the appendix we use the central limit theorem to make an initial prediction of the scaling of the time delay scatter ( see equation  ( [ eq : sigf2 ] ) ) : @xmath124 to test this prediction , we use the results from simulations with @xmath86 to fit for the proportionality constant , and then plot the analytic curves alongside the simulation results in figure  [ fig : mscaling ] .",
    "the agreement is striking given the simplicity of the analytic prediction .",
    "strictly speaking , the analytic scaling appears to overestimate the time delay scatter when the subhalo mass is large .",
    "we can identify at least two possible explanations .",
    "first , when @xmath76 is fixed increasing the subhalo mass decreases the number of subhalos , which may make the central limit theorem less applicable and invalidate an approximation in equation  ( [ eq : sigphi ] ) .",
    "second , as the subhalo mass increases the perturbations to the image positions also increase , which may invalidate one of our starting assumptions in the appendix .",
    "we are working on a more sophisticated theory of time delay perturbations to address both issues .",
    "for now , though , we consider the success of the initial analytic prediction to be very encouraging .",
    "the scaling of the time delay scatter with subhalo mass has an important corollary : there is no measurable effect on time delays from low - mass objects , such as stars .",
    "this means we can study millilensing at any wavelength without `` contamination '' from microlensing .",
    "so far we have assumed that all subhalos have the same mass ; now we consider a power law mass function .",
    "figure  [ fig : mfunc ] shows the time delay scatter as a function of the dynamic range @xmath81 and power law slope @xmath125 of the mass function .",
    "the dynamic range has a significant effect : the broader the mass function , the more scatter there is in lens time delays . the power law slope affects the time delay scatter as well , but much more modestly . for comparison we also plot the analytic scaling from equation  ( [ eq : sigf1 ] ) in the appendix , @xmath126 where the ratio @xmath127 can be found from equation  ( [ eq : msq ] ) .",
    "the analytic formula does not match the simulation results perfectly , but it seems remarkably good for something so simple .",
    "we take this as an indication that the theory of time delay millilensing will be analytically tractable . having a rigorous theory of millilensing is possible only with time delays ;",
    "analytic results for flux ratio millilensing are elusive because flux ratios are highly nonlinear and the central limit theorem does not apply ( see the appendix ) .",
    "so far we have treated the mass clumps as point masses , partly for simplicity and partly because we know the gravity outside any spherical mass clump is the same as that of a point mass .",
    "however , dark matter subhalos in general have some spatial extent , and if they overlap lensed images this may be important for millilensing . in this pilot study",
    "we mainly want to determine when the point mass approximation is reasonable and when we need to worry about subhalo size and structure .",
    "we therefore consider a simple model of isothermal spheres that are truncated ( in three dimensions ) at some radius @xmath97 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tsis ] shows how the time delay scatter changes when we vary the truncation radius while keeping the subhalo mass fixed .",
    "( the key scale is the dimensionless truncation radius , @xmath128 , where @xmath93 is the einstein radius of a point mass with the same mass , as defined by equation  ( [ eq : mhat ] ) . )",
    "depending on the mass , subhalos need to extend beyond 10 or more einstein radii before the internal structure becomes important .",
    "the obvious next step is to model tidal truncation and estimate the sizes of realistic subhalos .",
    "there are some important effects to consider : tidal forces vary with position in the parent halo ; and tidal truncation also corresponds to mass loss ( so , strictly speaking , it is not right to vary the truncation radius while keeping the subhalo mass fixed , although that is a useful pedagogical exercise ) .",
    "these effects are incorporated into semi - analytic substructure models , so in follow - up work we will study time delay millilensing using realistic subhalo populations drawn from those models .",
    "@xcite suggested that the arrival - time ordering of lensed images is a robust prediction of smooth lens models ( at least , those with relatively simple angular structure ) .",
    "with the help of a few simple rules , they noted , it is usually easy to identify the two minima and two saddlepoints in a quad lens , and then to deduce the arrival - time ordering . if the situation is not immediately obvious , a simple lens model makes it clear . we have therefore chosen to use the image classification and ordering as the basis of our labeling scheme : in arrival - time order we have the leading minimum ( m1 ) , the trailing minimum ( m2 ) , then the leading saddle ( s1 ) , and finally the trailing saddle ( s2 ) .    in the fold image configuration we have considered , substructure does not affect the arrival - time ordering .",
    "the reason is that the time delay perturbations are small compared with most of the time delays themselves .",
    "it might seem that the close image pair m2/s1 could provide an exception , because the smooth model time delay ( 0.16 day ) is shorter than some of the substructure perturbations we have seen .",
    "however , by definition a saddlepoint in the time delay surface must be higher than a nearby local minimum , so image s1 must trail m2 and the overall ordering must be preserved .",
    "one consequence is that the histogram for the m2/s1 time delay can not remain gaussian as the substructure perturbations grow , as shown in figure  [ fig : histbc ] .",
    "this implies that the substructure influences both images at some level , although the @xmath129 histograms are broad enough that it seems fair to say that substructure affects even nearby images quite differently .",
    "the only way this general analysis can be violated is if a massive and concentrated clump lies close enough to images m2 and s1 to change the global topology of the time delay surface ; but such a situation would be immediately apparent from the image configuration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the issue of arrival - time ordering is strikingly different for a cusp image configuration like that in rx j1131@xmath11231 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cuspimg](a ) shows the images along with selected arrival - time contours for our smooth mass model . in this example , and indeed in all smooth models of rx j1131@xmath11231 examined by @xcite , the image labeled m1 is the leading image .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : cuspimg](b ) , substructure can reverse the arrival - time order of the images m1 and m2 , such that the overall ordering is m2/m1/s1/s2 . in terms of the topology of the time delay surface",
    ", we can still say the saddlepoint must be higher than the two minima on either side , so s1 must trail both m1 and m2 . however , there are no such restrictions on the heights ( or depths , equivalently ) of the two minima with respect to each other .",
    "it is fairly easy for substructure to modify one or both of the minima enough to change their relative heights , and hence the arrival - time ordering of images m1 and m2 .",
    "in fact , some 27% of realizations with modest substructure ( substructure mass fraction @xmath86 and subhalo mass @xmath130 ) predict an arrival - time reversal ( see figure  [ fig : hist1131 ] ) .",
    "we believe image reversal by substructure may already have been observed in rx j1131@xmath11231 , based on the time delays reported by @xcite .",
    "the time ordering observed among the three bright images is m2/m1/s1 with @xmath131 days , @xmath132 days , and @xmath133 days .",
    "these time delays present two puzzles .",
    "first , image m2 is observed to lead image m1 , whereas smooth models predict the opposite .",
    "second , the observed m2/s1 and m1/s1 time delays are an order of magnitude longer than predicted by smooth models .",
    "@xcite focused their attention on the second problem , and showed that placing a single , massive ( @xmath134 ) subhalo near image s1 could explain the long m2/s1 time delay .",
    "their models still predicted m1 to be the leading image , though .",
    "as we have demonstrated , a _ population _ of subhalos might be able to reverse the ordering to make m2 the leading image .",
    "it will still take a lot of modeling to draw quantitative conclusions about the substructure required to explain the image ordering and the long time delays ; we will present the modeling details elsewhere ( c.  r.  keeton & l.  a.  moustakas , in preparation ) . for",
    "now , we mainly want to introduce the idea that the temporal ordering of images in a cusp configuration can be changed by substructure  and that this effect may already have been observed .",
    "having shown that substructure affects lens time delays , we still need to consider how well the perturbations could be detected in observed lenses . the question is whether uncertainties in the `` macromodel '' used to characterize the smooth component of the lens mass distribution could mask the effects of substructure .",
    "one key concern is the radial profile degeneracy : especially in quad lenses , varying the radial density profile of the lens galaxy can rescale the time delays while leaving other observables unchanged ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at first glance",
    ", this would seem to make changes induced by substructure degenerate with changes in the radial profile .",
    "however , the radial profile rescaling affects all images in the same way , while substructure affects each image differently .",
    "so with more than one time delay ( as in a quad lens ) , ratios of the delays cancel the rescaling and isolate substructure effects , as shown in figure  [ fig : alpha ]",
    ". the radial profile degeneracy will therefore not be a fundamental limitation in attempts to probe substructure with time delays .",
    "this very promising inference is currently empirical , but we expect it can be made rigorous with a full theory of time delay millilensing . since radial profile effects",
    "do not cancel perfectly ( there are small differences in the widths of the time delay ratio histograms in figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) , the theory will also be useful in understanding and correcting for these residual effects .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the angular structure of the macromodel . while it is common to fit",
    "observed lenses with an ellipsoidal mass distribution and external shear ( and we have used such a model to construct our mock lenses ) , real galaxies may be more complex . in particular , observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) elliptical galaxies often contain mild departures from elliptical symmetry that can be described with @xmath135 and @xmath136 multipole terms in the surface mass density .",
    "@xcite suggested that such multipole terms might provide an alternative to clumpy substructure when fitting observed lenses .",
    "although multipoles turn out not to provide a satisfactory explanation of observed flux ratio anomalies @xcite , it is important to consider how they might influence the analysis of time delays .",
    "we can do this by taking our mock lenses generated with substructure and trying to fit them with multipole models . for this exercise",
    "we adopt @xmath137 errorbars for the image positions , which is typical of observations with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and radio interferometry , and 5% time delay uncertainties , which is similar to the precision achieved for quad lenses today ( see the compilation by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", we find that multipole models can formally provide a good fit to the image positions and time delays , but many of the models have unreasonably large multipole terms that lead to unrealistic galaxy shapes , as shown in figure  [ fig : mpole ] . to avoid the unreasonable models we can impose some priors on the multipole terms . since the multipole moments in observed and simulated elliptical galaxies are typically at the percent level , a simple first step is to adopt gaussian priors on the multipole amplitudes @xmath138 and @xmath139 with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 0.02 .",
    "( in the present analysis we do not impose any constraints on the orientations of the multipole terms . ) with these mild amplitude priors , multipole models fail ( i.e. , they are inconsistent with the data at more than 95% confidence ) for 27 of the 100 mock lenses we examine .",
    "we are in the process ( j.  van saders et al . , in preparation ) of deriving more sophsticated priors on multipole terms from a large sample of galaxies in the galaxy evolution from morphologies and seds survey ( gems ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we expect that those will be even more valuable in constraining macromodels and thus aiding the identification of time delay anomalies .",
    "it is perhaps artificial to insist that we must identify anomalous lenses on the basis of time delays alone , when flux ratios are also available to provide additional constraints .",
    "if we fit the flux ratios along with the image positions and time delays , we find that multipole models fail ( at 95% confidence ) for 52 of 100 mock lenses even if we use generous 10% flux errorbars and do not impose any priors on the multipole terms .",
    "interestingly , only 28 of those failures would be identified on the basis of flux ratios alone ; in 24 of the mock lenses , it is only when we fit the time delays and flux ratios simultaneously that the anomalies become clear .",
    "we infer that time delays and flux ratios contain different and complementary information about the small - scale structure of the lens potential .",
    "while we plan to address the issues of multipole priors and complementarity of time delays and flux ratios in detail in future work , we offer the preliminary conclusion that macromodel uncertainties can be controlled well enough that we can expect to use time delays to learn about substructure .",
    "we have shown that substructure in lens galaxies modifies the time delays in multiply - imaged gravitational lenses .",
    "the amplitude of time delay perturbations depends on the abundance of substructure , the mass function of subhalos , and to some extent the internal structure of subhalos as well .",
    "this phenomenon , which we call time delay millilensing , has some very attractive properties .",
    "first , the effects of substructure on time delays are fairly easy to understand , both conceptually and quantitatively .",
    "second , time delay perturbations are unaffected by stellar microlensing or extinction in the lens galaxy .",
    "third , time delay ratios are immune to the radial profile degeneracy in lens modeling .    furthermore , time delay millilensing is sensitive to the mass function of subhalos in a different way than flux ratio and astrometric millilensing . for point",
    "mass perturbers , the lensing optical depth depends on @xmath140 .",
    "the potential of a clump scales with its mass , so time delay perturbations depend in full on @xmath141 .",
    "( see the appendix for more details . ) for comparison , position perturbations have a scale of @xmath142 while magnification perturbations are dimensionless , which means that astrometric millilensing depends on @xmath143 while flux ratio millilensing depends on @xmath144 ( compare * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore suggest that lens time delays should join image positions and flux ratios as tools for studying dark matter substructure in distant galaxies .",
    "since the three observables measure different moments of the subhalo mass function , the combination of all three will ultimately provide a powerful way to test cdm predictions and even to explore the nature of dark matter itself , given that different dark matter candidates may produce different mass functions at subgalactic scales , as a function of lens galaxy mass and redshift .    before we try to use time delays to measure substructure ,",
    "it is vital that we understand whether systematic uncertainties in lens models could corrupt substructure constraints .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the radial profile degeneracy is not a significant problem , as time delay ratios essentially factor out the profile dependence .",
    "we have drawn the preliminary conclusion that uncertainties in the angular structure of the lens potential can be dealt with , using additional flux ratios data and/or independent constraints on the shapes of galaxy mass distributions .",
    "other potential concerns may include the environment of the lens galaxy @xcite , and ( sub)structure along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "for all of these issues , the important point is again that non - local features in the lens potential affect the images in some coordinated way , whereas substructure affects the images differently .",
    "we also need to predict time delay perturbations for subhalo populations that are more realistic than the simple ones we have used ( for pedagogical purposes ) here .",
    "this work is underway , using existing semi - analytic substructure models . by incorporating important physical effects such as accretion of new subhalos and tidal truncation and disruption of old subhalos ,",
    "these models yield subhalo populations whose spatial distributions and mass functions agree well with results from @xmath145-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our follow - up calculations will offer greater insight into the subtleties of time delay perturbations in a broader range of realistic circumstances , and better guidance as to how well we need to measure time delays if we want to probe dark matter substructure .",
    "we have noted that in extraordinary lenses with close triplets of images in a cusp configuration , it may be possible to detect the effects of substructure through unambiguous changes in the arrival - time ordering of the images ( compared to expectations for standard macromodels ) .",
    "we expect , though , that the real power of time delay millilensing will lie in its application to large ensembles of lenses with measured time delays . at present , time delay uncertainties are typically at the level of 1 day ( see @xcite for a compilation )",
    ". improvements of a factor of a few are desired : our preliminary estimates indicate that improving the uncertainties to @xmath1460.5% would yield constraints on substructure at the level of 0.30.5 dex in a given 4-image lens . @xcite have shown that coordinated global optical monitoring can yield time delays with uncertainties of less than 0.1 day .",
    "monitoring at x - ray wavelengths , where variability can be rapid and dramatic , can yield even more precise time delays : @xcite measure a time delay of @xmath147 hours between the two close images in pg 1115 + 080 with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . with some effort , such techniques",
    "can probably be extended to a modest sample of time delays in the near future . over the longer term",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "even better would be a dedicated space platform capable of precise monitoring of lenses over extended periods of time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "looking to the future , measuring precise image positions , flux ratios , and time delays in a sample of @xmath146100 quad lenses could yield substructure measurements at the 20%30% level or better .",

    "the work of lam was carried out at jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
    "in this appendix we present an initial theory of the statistics of time delay perturbations .",
    "this theory rests on three assumptions : ( 1 ) subhalos are statistically independent ( of each other ; the probability of having a subhalo may still depend on position ) ; ( 2 ) subhalos may be treated as point masses ; and ( 3 ) time delay perturbations are dominated by changes in the lens potential ( as opposed to changes in the image positions ) .",
    "the first assumption means that all subhalo positions and masses are drawn from the same probability distribution .",
    "this simplifies the theory , and seems reasonable for lensing since we work in projection and subhalos that are near each other on the sky are most likely well separated in space .",
    "the second and third assumptions will be relaxed in future work , but are adequate for our present goal of understanding in a general way how the time delay scatter depends on the amount of substructure and the subhalo mass function .",
    "the lens time delay has the form given by equation  ( [ eq : tdel ] ) . by assumption # 3 , if we want to understand how substructure affects @xmath149 , it is sufficient to study the potential difference @xmath150 .",
    "any change in the time delay is simply given by the change in the potential difference , multiplied by the time scale @xmath33 .",
    "the potential due to a collection of @xmath145 subhalos is the sum of contributions from individual subhalos .",
    "if the subhalos are point masses , the potential difference has the form @xmath151 if we can show that the mean and variance of @xmath152 are finite , then we can use the central limit theorem to infer that the sum @xmath153 will be approximately gaussian , and to determine the variance of @xmath153 .    in order to compute the mean and variance of @xmath152",
    ", we need to average over a subhalo s position and mass .",
    "let @xmath154 be the probability distribution for the subhalo s position , while @xmath155 is the probability distribution for its mass .",
    "then the average of any function @xmath156 has the form @xmath157 it is useful to note that smoothed substrucure density distribution , @xmath158 , may be written in terms of the position probability distribution : @xmath159 now in order to determine the mean and variance of @xmath152 , we need to compute the moments @xmath160 in both cases we used equation  ( [ eq : ks ] ) to substitute for @xmath154 in terms of @xmath161 .",
    "we also identified the mass integrals as yielding the averages @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the variance is then @xmath164 at the second step , we note that @xmath165 while @xmath166 , so when there are many subhalos we may neglect the second term .",
    "the integrands in equations  ( [ eq : phi1int ] ) and ( [ eq : phi2int ] ) diverge near @xmath167 and @xmath168 , but only logarithmically , and such a divergence is still integrable . as a result , as long as @xmath158 does not diverge badly near the image positions , the integrals are well behaved , so the mean and variance of @xmath152 are finite .",
    "this means the central limit theorem holds , and we can infer that the potential difference @xmath153 , and hence the time delay @xmath169 , will have a distribution that is approximately gaussian .",
    "( this argument also applies to clumps that are not point masses , because then any divergence in @xmath152 will be softer than logarithmic . )",
    "furthermore , thanks to the central limit theorem we may compute the variance in @xmath153 as the quadrature sum of the variances of all the individual @xmath152 terms  or , in this case , a simple multiplication by @xmath145 : @xmath170 and of course @xmath171 . heuristically , we may summarize this result as @xmath172 where @xmath161 is indicative of the amount of substructure .",
    "while this expression oversimplifies the dependence on the spatial distribution of subhalos , it is conceptually instructive . in our simulations , we write @xmath173 , and we keep the total mass distribution @xmath174 fixed while we change the substructure mass fraction @xmath76 . therefore it is formally correct to write @xmath175 this is our general conclusion for how the time delay scatter depends on the amount of substructure and the subhalo mass function .",
    "note that if all subhalos have the same mass @xmath91 , this simplifies to @xmath176    it is instructive to consider whether the central limit theorem can be applied to flux ratios as well as time delays . for point",

    "now when we try to compute the mean and variance of each term by integrating over @xmath181 , the integrand diverges non - integrably near @xmath7 , and so the mean and variance diverge ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "the central limit theorem therefore does not apply .",
    "the magnification probability distribution @xmath182 may still be perfectly well defined , but it need not be gaussian .",
    "indeed , @xmath182 can be computed analytically for a uniform distribution of point masses , and it is distinctly non - gaussian ( see  11.2 of * ? ? ?",
    ". there may be circumstances ( say , certain types of spatially extended clumps ) for which the central limit theorem does apply to magnifications , but the theorem is not universally applicable as it is for time delays .    returning to time delays ,",
    "there is one last bit of theory that is useful .",
    "we intuitively expect that clumps far from the images have little effect on the time delay , but we can quantify this statement .",
    "consider for simplicity images at @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and let us examine only subhalos at radii @xmath185 .",
    "we return to equation  ( [ eq : siggen ] ) , plug in for @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and then take a taylor series expansion to lowest order in @xmath186 : @xmath187 notice that we have changed notation and written @xmath188 to highlight that this is an error term  specifically , the rms error we make by neglecting subhalos beyond @xmath108 .",
    "we have computed the error in the potential , but we can relate it to the rms error in the time delay via @xmath189 .",
    "( we have verified equation  ( [ eq : rthresh ] ) using direct simulations of subhalo populations extending to large radii . )",
    "we have assumed for simplicity that the substructure mass distribution is circularly symmetric , @xmath190 , but the generalization to elliptical symmetry is straightforward . for any reasonable substructure distribution , @xmath191 decreases as @xmath192 , so the integral converges . not only that , but @xmath193 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath108 . in other words ,",
    "the farther the subhalos are from the images , the less effect they have on the time delays .",
    "if we can tolerate some small error in time delays , we may neglect all subhalos beyond some threshold radius @xmath108 .",
    "once we specify the time delay error tolerance , we can solve equation  ( [ eq : rthresh ] ) to compute the threshold radius @xmath108 .",
