    "it turns out that @xmath7 is smooth , and its dualizing sheaf is trivial as well .",
    "in fact , generalized kummer varieties are important examples of _ hyperkhler manifolds_.    the same construction works over ground fields of characteristic @xmath8 .",
    "the hilbert scheme @xmath3 is still smooth with trivial dualizing sheaf . for the generalized kummer varieties , however , entirely new geometric phenomena arise : as we shall see , @xmath7 is not necessarily smooth , and may even be nonnormal .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the addition map and the generalized kummer variety in the simplest accessible case , namely in characteristic @xmath9 for @xmath10 points .",
    "the first main result is the following :    in characteristic two , all fibers of the addition map @xmath11 are nonsmooth .",
    "they are always geometrically reduced , and geometrically normal if and only if the abelian variety @xmath2 is not superspecial .",
    "whence @xmath11 is an example of a _ quasifibration _ , that is , its generic fiber is regular but not geometrically regular .",
    "such a startling violation of sard s lemma is only possible in positive characteristics .",
    "so far , there is little systematic study of quasifibrations , except for the special case of quasielliptic surfaces , which play an important role in the enriques classification in positive characteristics @xcite .    the generalizsed kummer surface @xmath12 is related to the classical kummer surface , which is the quotient @xmath13 of the abelian surface by the sign involution . for such quotients artin s classification @xcite of involutions on surfaces in characteristic two applies .",
    "shioda @xcite and katsura @xcite proved that the singularities on the normal surface @xmath13 are certain rational or elliptic double points .",
    "this is in startling contrast to the complex situation , where we always have sixteen ordinary double points .",

    "the supersingular case is most challenging : here our analysis depends on laufer s theory of _ minimally elliptic singularities _ @xcite .",
    "the existence of a crepant partial resolution holds true in general for quotients of surfaces by involutions in characteristic two , and is closely related to @xmath21-hilbert schemes .",
    "recall the complex _",
    "mckay correspondence _ in dimension two was established in various degrees of generality : ito and nakamura @xcite showed that the minimal resolution of singularities for rational double points is isomorphic to a suitable @xmath21-hilbert scheme .",

    "the third main result of this paper describes the mckay correspondence in this situation :    the blowing - up @xmath28 of the image of the fixed scheme @xmath29 is a crepant partial resolution with @xmath30 .",
    "the scheme @xmath31 is isomorphic to the reduced @xmath21-hilbert scheme @xmath32 .    the scheme @xmath31 is usually nonnormal , and the nonreduced @xmath21-hilbert scheme @xmath33 usually contains embedded components .",
    "note that the two descriptions @xmath34 are entirely different : the first is effective for explicit computations , the second is useful for theoretical considerations .",

    "example : rdp ] , we discuss the case that the singularity @xmath36 is a rational double point in detail .",
    "after that , we turn to abelian surfaces : in section [ the sign involution ] , i apply the preceding results to the sign involution on an abelian surface @xmath2 .",
    "the case of abelian varieties with nonzero @xmath0-rank is comparatively straightforward .",
    "the supersingular case is treated in the next two sections : in section [ minimally elliptic ] , we use the theory of minimally elliptic singularities to determine the singularities and the crepant partial resolution for @xmath15 in the case that @xmath2 is supersingular but not superspecial . in section",
    "[ superspecial case ] , we unravel the superspecial case . here",
    "the crepant partial resolution is nonnormal .",
    "it is obtained from the blowing - up of the reduced singular point , which is nonnormal as well , by a kind of infinitesimal flip . in section [ serre conditions ] , we analyse symmetric products and the extent of their cohen  macaulayness . in section [ symmetric products ] , we consider symmetric products of abelian varieties and the effect of the addition map on the geometry of the symmetric product . in section [ hilbert - chow",

    "then the quotient @xmath25 is a quasiprojective normal surface .",

    "therefore , it might be seen as a partial resolution of singularities .",

    "it yields a translation @xmath727 which is a @xmath61-morphism .",
    "this induces a @xmath61-morphism @xmath728 , such that the diagram @xmath729 is commutative .",
