    "presently there are a number of efforts to constrain the dense matter equations of state ( esos ) through astronomical observations of compact stars .",
    "the usual approach is to determine the mass and the radius of the stars with the help of various observational features like gravitational redshifts ( z ) from spectral lines , cooling characteristics , khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) etc ( lattimer & prakash 2007 , li @xmath3 1999 , zel 2006 , 2008 , zhang @xmath3 2007 ) .",
    "but these methods are not foolproof , @xmath4 the value of z used in zel s ( 2006 ) analysis of exo 0748@xmath5676 can not be reproduced as mentioned by klahn @xmath3 ( 2006 ) . moreover , to constrain esos from qpo observations , one needs to believe in a particular model of qpo which is again a subject of debate .",
    "another alternative method might be the measurement of the moment of inertia from the faster component of the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 ( lattimer & schutz 2005 , bagchi @xmath3 2008 ) . some high mass stars like psr j1903 + 0327 , exo 0748@xmath5676 @xmath6 prefer stiff eos and some other stars like 4u 1728 - 34 ( li @xmath3 1999 ) , exo 1745 - 248 ( zel 2008 ) , prefer soft eos . this fact hints to the possibility of existence of both neutron stars and strange stars .",

    "although stellar structures for rotating neutron stars or strange stars have been already studied by a number of groups ( some of which i discuss in section [ sec : rot_param ] ) , systematic studies of all relevant stellar parameters as well as disk parameters were lacking .",
    "that is why here i report the variation of a number of different stellar parameters as well as disk parameters for different values of star s spin frequency and mass in section [ sec : stell_struct ] and section [ sec : rot_param ] .",
    "also i use one eos for strange stars and another eos for neutron stars whereas in the earlier works people discussed either only neutron star rotations or only strange star rotations , there was no comparison between the properties of rotating neutron stars and rotating strange stars .",
    "in addition i compare my results obtained by using a pseudo - newtonian potential with full general relativistic calculations by other people like haensel & zdunik ( 1989 ) and lattimer & prakash ( 2004 ) and the close matching found implies the correctness of my approach and the validity of the pseudo - newtonian potential . in section [ sec : application ]",

    "we study the rotational parameters for strange stars and neutron stars using the rns code which consider the generalized axisymmetric metric for rotating stars .",
    "i find that the rotational parameters like @xmath19 , @xmath27 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath145 depend on @xmath7 and the choice of the eos .",
    "the value of @xmath44 depends on the stellar mass , the choice of the eos and whether the motion is co - rotating or counter - rotating .",
    "the dependence of @xmath60 on the choice of eos , @xmath17 and the direction of motion is prominent only at low @xmath49 ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "that is why , the values of @xmath147 as obtained by fitting the khz qpo frequencies do not depend much on the choice of the eos and on the direction of motion as here @xmath172 .",
    "the beat frequency model suggests that @xmath143 is the radius of the innermost keplerian orbit of the ( @xmath173 ) of the accretion disk whereas the models by titarchuk and osherovich ( 1999 ) and mukhopadhyay @xmath3 ( 2003 ) suggest that @xmath174 .",
    "the disk parameter @xmath173 can be estimated by x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "as relativistic broadening is more dominant at the innermost edge of the disk , the existence of a relativistically broadened iron k@xmath175 line helps one to determine the value of @xmath173 ( reis , fabian & young 2009 ; di salvo @xmath3 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "it is clear from the table [ tb : qpo2 ] that for a fixed set of @xmath14 and @xmath7 , @xmath173 is different for different esos , but the difference is always @xmath176 , whereas presently @xmath173 is measured only accuracy up to @xmath177 ( reis , fabian & young 2009 ; di salvo @xmath3 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , one should remember that this determination of @xmath173 depends upon the qpo model which is not beyond doubt at the present moment .",
    "indeed there is a strong need of better explanation of khz qpos to understand various features like the shift of the peaks , their correlations ( belloni , mndez and homan 2007 ; yin @xmath3 2007 ) , side - bands ( jonker , mndez and van der klis 2005 ) etc . considering all these facts ,",
    "i conclude that , to constrain dense matter eos by measuring @xmath173 using x - ray spectral analysis , i need much better accuracy and hopefully future advanced technology like astrosat will provide us such ultra - high accuracy .    in this work",
    "i have primarily confined myself to a maximum value of @xmath7 as 796 hz .",
    "but then i have also studied the properties of the compact stars if they rotate with the maximum spin frequency @xmath0 the keplerian spin frequency .",
