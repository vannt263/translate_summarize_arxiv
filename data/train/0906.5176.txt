    "the most celebrated models in statistical mechanics are the ising models , introduced by ising in @xcite , and their generalizations to potts models @xcite .",
    "usually , the one - dimensional ising or potts models admit a closed - form analytical solution and do not exhibit the _ phase transition _ phenomenon , as in the case of the original work of ising for ferromagnetism .",
    "the importance of ising models was demonstrated by onsager s closed - form solution for the two - dimensional ferromagnetism model in the zero - field case @xcite , which does exhibit phase transition at exactly one temperature .",
    "unfortunately , there are only a handful of known closed - form solutions for two - dimensional potts models , including the dimer problem due to fisher , kasteleyn and temperley @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; residual entropy of square ice by lieb @xcite ; hard hexagons by baxter @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "thus , most of the interesting potts models , in particular all problems in dimension @xmath1 and up , are treated by ad hoc asymptotic expansions or by some kind of numerical solutions , in many circumstances with the help of monte carlo simulations , which usually have a heuristic basis .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce a new mathematical foundation to this subject , which also gives rise to reliable numerical methods , using converging upper and lower bounds , for computing the _ pressure _ and its derivatives for known quantities in statistical mechanics . in principle , these quantities can be computed to any accuracy given sufficient computing power .",
    "the first - order phase transition is manifested by a jump in a corresponding directional derivative of the pressure , which can be detected within the given precision of the computation .",
    "our approach to the phase transition is significantly simpler than the approaches using the gibbs equilibrium measures corresponding to the pressure , e.g. @xcite . in models with one variable ,",
    "the situation is relatively well understood by physicists .",
    "the basic argument of phase transition in ising model is due to peierls @xcite . for more modern account of the physicist s approach see [ pp 59]gri .",
    "we now introduce the main ideas of this paper as nontechnically as possible .",
    "assume that we have a standard lattice @xmath0 , consisting of points in @xmath2-dimensional space @xmath3 with integer coordinates , which we call _",
    "sites_. each site @xmath4 is occupied by exactly one particle , or color , out of the set @xmath5 of @xmath6 distinct colors ( if we do not insist that every site be occupied , we agree to use color @xmath6 for an unoccupied site ) . in general , one has a local type of restriction on the allowed configurations of the colors , which is called a _ subshift of finite type _ , or _ soft _ , known as the hard - core model in physics terminology . the exact definition of a soft is given in the next section . for an example of soft , consider the residual entropy of square ice studied in @xcite .",
    "this entropy is the exponential growth rate of the number of colorings of increasing sequences of squares in @xmath7 with @xmath8 colors , subject to the local restriction that no two adjacent sites receive the same color .",
    "more generally , we consider a nonempty _ near neighbor soft _",
    "( nnsoft ) , specified by a @xmath2-tuple @xmath9 , where each @xmath10 is a digraph whose set of vertices is the set @xmath11 of colors .",
    "two adjacent sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , are allowed to receive the colors @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively only if @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the set of all allowed colorings in this nnsoft by @xmath18 .    we assume for simplicity of the exposition that the hamiltonian of a particle of color @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "if this is not the case , as for the ising model or the monomer - dimer model , there is a way to reduce such a model to our model by enlarging the number of colors .",
    "we show how to carry out this reduction for the monomer - dimer model .    for @xmath21 ,",
    "let @xmath22 denote the @xmath2-dimensional box @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a coloring @xmath22 with @xmath6 colors , i.e. , an ensemble of @xmath25 particles of @xmath6 kinds occupying the sites in @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the number of sites in @xmath22 colored with color @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the system @xmath29 is equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the _ grand partition function _ corresponding to the set @xmath31 of all colorings @xmath24 allowed by @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 it is well - known that @xmath34 is a convex function .",
    "furthermore , the multisequence @xmath34 , @xmath35 is subadditive in each coordinate of @xmath36",
    ". hence the following limit exists @xmath37 where @xmath38 means @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "this limit is called the _ pressure _ function .",
    "the value @xmath41 is the ( free ) entropy of the corresponding soft , and our previous paper @xcite was devoted to the theory of its computation .",
    "the function @xmath42 is a lipschitz convex function .",
    "hence it is continuous and subdifferentiable everywhere , and differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "assume that @xmath43 is differentiable at @xmath44 with gradient vector @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath46 is a probability vector , and @xmath47 is the relative frequency , or proportion , of color @xmath19 corresponding to the pressure @xmath48 . we show that the points @xmath44 where @xmath48 is not differentiable correspond to phase transitions of the _ first order _ , i.e. , these are points @xmath44 where the proportions of the colors are not unique .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the simplex of probability vectors .",
    "assume that @xmath50 is a limiting color proportion vector for some multisequence of configurations in @xmath31 , @xmath38 .",
    "then one can define the _ density entropy _",
    "@xmath51 as the maximal exponential growth rate of the number of configurations , the maximum being taken over all multisequences whose color proportion vector tends to @xmath52 .",
    "( see for example @xcite for the special case of the monomer - dimer configurations . )",
    "we denote by @xmath53 the compact set of all limiting color proportion vectors .",
    "let @xmath54 $ ] be the _ conjugate _ of @xmath43 , which is called the legendre - fenchel transform in the case of differentiable convex functions @xcite . recall that @xmath55 is a convex function .",
    "we show that for a limiting color proportion vector @xmath52 , that is also a subgradient of the pressure function somewhere , @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath57 is a concave function on each convex set of such vectors @xmath52 in @xmath58 .",
    "we next show that in many soft arising in physical models , the set @xmath58 is convex and the function @xmath59 is concave .",
    "a simple example is as follows .",
    "assume that our soft given by @xmath32 has a friendly color , say @xmath6 .",
    "this is , in each digraph @xmath60 the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath19 connected in both directions , i.e. @xmath61 , for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath58 is convex and @xmath64 is concave .",
    "the hard core model has a friendly color .",
    "the monomer - dimer model has essentially a friendly color , which corresponds to the dimer , hence @xmath65 and @xmath66 is concave .",
    "these results can be viewed as generalizations of the result of hammersley @xcite .    for numerical computations of the pressure one needs to have lower bounds for the pressure , which converge to the pressure in the limit .",
    "( the convergent upper bounds are given by @xmath67 , since the multisequence @xmath34 , @xmath35 is subadditive in each coordinate of @xmath36 . )",
    "we extend the results in @xcite to give lower convergent bounds if at least @xmath68 digraphs out of @xmath69 are symmetric .",
    "( a digraph @xmath70 is called symmetric , ( reversible ) , if the diedge @xmath71 is in @xmath72 whenever @xmath73 is in @xmath72 . )",
    "this condition holds for most of the known physical models . in this paper",
    "we show how to apply the computational methods developed in @xcite to the pressure .",
    "we demonstrate the applications of our methods to the two dimensional monomer - dimer model on @xmath7 .",
    "first we confirm the heuristic computations of baxter @xcite .",
    "second , we find numerically a number of values of the pressure function @xmath74 and the value of the density entropy @xmath75 for dimers with densities @xmath76 in the directions @xmath77 respectively . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we give the plots of these functions .",
    "these computations go beyond the known computations of @xcite , where one considers the total density of dimers , ( which reduce to the computations of functions of one variable ) .",
    "we hope to show that the methods of this paper can be applied to other interesting models .",
    "we already know that our approach works for the numerical computation of the pressure function for the 2d and 3d ising models in external magnetic field .",
    "( it is similar to the monomer - dimer model we study here . )",
    "we plan to study if our numerical computations are precise enough to discover the second order phase transitions , which occurs in multidimensional ising models .",
    "we now survey briefly the contents of the paper . in section  [ softnnsoftandpressure ]",
    "we describe in details soft , nnsoft and the pressure function .",
    "we also show that in the one - dimensional case , the pressure is the logarithm of the spectral radius of a corresponding nonnegative matrix . in section  [ sec : symmetricnnsoft ] we show that under certain symmetry ( reversibility ) assumptions on @xmath68 digraphs among @xmath69 , we have computable converging upper and lower bounds for the pressure . in section  [ densityentropy ]",
    "we relate certain properties of a convex function , as differentiability and its conjugate @xmath78 , ( the legendre - fenchel transform ) , to the physical quantities associated with a given soft , i.e. the corresponding potts model .",
    "in particular we show that the points where the pressure @xmath43 is differentiable correspond to unique color frequency vectors . on the other hand",
    "the points were the pressure is not differentiable correspond to the phase transition of first order , since to this value of @xmath44 correspond at least two different color frequencies .",
    "we also relate the density entropy @xmath51 to the conjugate function @xmath78 . in section  [",
    "sec : onedimensionalsoft ] we apply the results of section  [ densityentropy ] to a one - dimensional soft .",
    "the importance of one - dimensional soft is due to the fact that our approximations of the pressure are obtained by using the exact results on one - dimensional soft .",

    "we also relate our results to the works of hammersley and baxter @xcite .",
    "this is done by using the fact that the monomer - dimer model in @xmath0 can be realized as soft with @xmath79 colors @xcite . as we pointed out in @xcite this soft",
