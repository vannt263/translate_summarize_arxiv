    "the standard evolutionary scenario for agns suggests that their jets are not in direct contact with the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , but rather are enveloped in a cocoon . the cocoon around a pair of supersonic , low - density ( when compared to the ambient igm ) jets acts as a ` wastebasket ' for most of the energy deposited by the jets ( scheuer 1974 ) .",
    "a number of cavities in x - ray surface brightness maps were detected by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory in clusters of galaxies ( for a review , see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .",
    "so far the largest cavities in x - ray surface brightness maps have been revealed in the ms 0735 + 7421 and hercules a clusters of galaxies ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ; nulsen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these x - ray cavities extend over several hundreds of kpc and are formed by powerful agn jet activity .",
    "the presence of x - ray cavities can be caused by very hot gas embedded in the agn cocoons .",
    "low - density gas with high temperatures of @xmath1 kev does not significantly emit in the soft x - ray band and , therefore , high temperature regions can be associated with x  ray cavities .",
    "numerical simulations of agn cocoons in galaxy clusters show that electron temperatures of the order of 100 kev are expected for the plasma in agn cocoons ( see , e.g. , sternberg & soker 2009 ; perucho et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by free thermal electrons located in an agn cocoon causes a change of the cmb spectrum ( see pfrommer et al .",
    "2005 and prokhorov et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this paper",
    ", we identify this change of the cmb spectrum with the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ; for a review , see birkinshaw 1999 ) from agn cocoons .",
    "the advent of new telescopes , such as _ herschel _ , _ gbt _ , and _ alma _ should allow us to measure the cmb distortion towards agn cocoons at various frequencies with high sensitivity and with high angular resolution ( see , zemcov et al .",
    "2010 ; korngut et al .",
    "2011 ; yamada et al .",
    "2012 , for the first observations of the sz effect from galaxy clusters by _ herschel - spire _ , _ gbt - mustang _ , and the recent simulations of sz maps of _ alma _ , respectively ) . as shown by prokhorov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the cmb intensity change at a frequency of 217 ghz , which approximately corresponds to the crossover frequency of the sz effect from a low temperature gas with @xmath2 kev ( see sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ) , is maximal at the temperature of @xmath3100 kev ( see colafrancesco 2005 for a review of the sz effect from agn cocoons in non - thermal electron models ) . the frequency shift of cmb photons owing to ic scattering increases with electron temperature",
    ". therefore , we assume that the cmb distortion caused by ic scattering by a high temperature plasma with @xmath1 kev should also be significant at high frequencies .",
    "so far , the sz effect from agn cocoons in galaxy clusters has been calculated by using analytical toy models for gas pressure and temperature distributions in cocoons ( see colafrancesco 2005 ; pfrommer et al . 2005 ) because of lack of available hydrodynamic simulations of agn cocoons .",
    "these toy models do not take into account intrinsic properties of the jet  icm system and , therefore , can lead to oversimplification . to test consistency and feasibility of these toy models , it is necessary to calculate the sz effect from agn cocoons which are derived from relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the jet  icm system and to confront the results obtained from the analytical toy models with those obtained from more realistic numerical models . using the pluto code ( mignone et al .",
    "2007 ) , we performed relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of agn cocoons produced by very light ( i.e. under - dense compared with the icm ) powerful jets .",
    "our numerical simulations take into account different properties of agn jets and icm , such as the power of the jets , the jet - to - icm density contrast , velocity , gas density and temperature distributions , and a dark matter halo profile , all providing us with a more realistic agn cocoon model .",
    "the performed simulations demonstrate that the internal structure of the region around agn jets is more complex than that assumed in analytical toy models .",
    "we calculate the cmb spectrum distortion caused by ic scattering of the cmb photons by highly energetic electrons in the framework of the relativistically correct wright formalism and study the sz effect from simulated agn cocoons at various frequencies . in this paper , we show that more realistic plasma models obtained from numerical hydrodynamic simulations predict : ( 1 ) that the morphology of sz intensity maps changes with frequency and ( 2 ) that sz signals at high frequencies from agn cocoons are higher than those from the shocked ambient intracluster medium and , therefore , the sz morphological study can reveal the presence of agn cocoons on sz maps .",
    "the fully relativistic approach for calculating the sz effect from agn cocoons considered below shows that the cocoon is strongly inhomogeneous and that future measurements of the sz effect will permit one to study the internal structure of regions formed by agn activity .",
    "we also show that the tight constraints on the total thermal energy of high temperature electrons which are stored in agn cocoons can be obtained by taking into account the shape of relativistic sz spectral functions .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in sect .",
    "we calculate the sz effect from the simulated agn cocoons in the relativistically correct wright formalism and study the possibility to detect agn cocoons through sz observations in sect .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "in this section , we introduce the code and initial conditions used in our simulations , describe the setup of the simulated domain , ambient medium and jet parameters , and present our results of the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of agn cocoons .",
    "our numerical simulations of agn outflows were performed using the publicly available pluto astrophysical computational code ( mignone et al .",
    "pluto is a modern multi - physics , high - resolution , high - order shock capturing godunov code with the later versions including adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability ( mignone et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it was developed with a modular design and includes a variety of physics and solver algorithms making it very adaptable to tackle a diverse range of astrophysical problems ( see , e.g. murphy et al .",
    "2010 ; kritsuk et al . 2011 ; teileanu et al . 2012 . )",
    "it is particularly suitable for our specific purposes of agn jet simulations as it incorporates a module to solve the equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics ( rhd ) , which we utilise to simulate our relativistic outflows .",
    "as we are only interested in the final large - scale evolved morphology of the agn jet / cocoon system , we assume the launching , acceleration , and collimation process has taken place off the grid and so we only introduce a pre - collimated jet flow into the computational domain .",
    "therefore , we use the rhd module where we also assume that the bulk kinetic energy within the flow has overcome any possible mhd effects on the cocoon morphology . magnetic pressures in the icm are likely to be much smaller than the gas pressure , but magnetic fields can still play a significant role on scales ( e.g. , jones 2008 and references therein ) which are much smaller than our computational domain .",
    "the pluto rhd module solves the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics as described in mignone et al .",
    "the equations are closed with the pluto ` taub ' equation of state , which is the quadratic approximation of the theoretical relativistic perfect gas equation of state . in this work",
    "we did not deem it necessary to include a radiative cooling function as the typical cooling times of the low density , high temperature gas present in agn cocoons are significantly longer compared to the simulation time and should not substantially modify the result of our sz effect study ( see appendix b by antonuccio - delogu & silk 2008 ) .",
    "we allow the code to solve the rhd equations using the muscl - hancock second - order scheme with the hllc riemann solver by mignone & bodo ( 2005 ) , and using the second - order linear total variation diminishing ( tvd ) interpolation .",
    "this combination promises the most efficient second - order scheme , plus a robust and accurate riemann solver .",
    "we make use of the common approximation that astrophysical jets can be treated as cylindrical and thus we perform our simulations using 2.5d axisymmetry .",
    "we also include amr which adaptively applies a higher resolution grid only where required which can be a much more efficient alternative to using a fixed grid of the highest resolution over the entire computational domain .",
    ".model parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we choose the angular size of an agn cocoon of @xmath4 ( that is a bit larger than the fwhm , see ade et al .",
    "2011 ) that corresponds to 300 kpc at the red - shift of z=0.05 .",
    "the calculated upper limits on the thermal energy that can be derived from the _ planck _ observations at 217 ghz and 857 ghz are higher than @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 . although the derived values are higher than those that can be obtained by the instruments discussed below , the advantage of the _ planck _ mission is that there is the possibility to search for agn cocoons by surveying the whole sky .",
    "the _ herschel _ spacecraft was launched on 14 may 2009 , along with the _ planck _ spacecraft .",
    "the _ herschel - spire _ instrument contains an imaging photometer and an imaging spectrometer ( griffin et al .",
    "the imaging photometer operates in three frequency bands centred on 600 ghz , 857 ghz , and 1200 ghz .",
    "the first results of observing clusters of galaxies by _ herschel - spire _ has revealed the contribution of relativistic effects to the sz signal from the bullet cluster at a frequency of 857 ghz ( zemcov et al .",
    "2010 ) . to calculate the upper limit on the thermal energy stored in agn cocoons that can be obtained from the sz observations at a frequency of 857 ghz with _ heschel - spire _ , we take the instrumental noise level from the paper by prokhorov et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that was derived by using the the herschel observation planning tool .",
    "the sz intensity @xmath7 of @xmath8 , that is close to that which was derived in sect .",
    "3.2 corresponds to @xmath9 0.4 mjy beam@xmath6 .",
    "the instrument noise of _ herschel - spire _ ( nguyen et al . 2010 ) can be reduced with integration time .",
    "we find that a total on - source integration time of 4 h is sufficient to make an instrumental noise level of 0.25 mjy beam@xmath6 for a frequency of 857 ghz .",
    "foreground contamination is a source of additional noise at 857 ghz .",
    "the foreground contamination can be subtracted from the 350 @xmath10 m ( corresponding to 857 ghz ) channel by analysing the 250-@xmath10 m and 500 @xmath10 m emission .",
    "zemcov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) generated a 250-@xmath10 m source catalogue and corrected the 350- and 500-@xmath10 m emission maps to obtain foreground - free measurements of the sz effect .",
    "we choose the angular size of an agn cocoon equal to the fwhm that is of @xmath11 ( i.e. 25@xmath12 ) that corresponds to 75 kpc at the red - shift of z=0.2 .",
    "the calculated upper limits on the thermal energy of 100 - 400 kev electrons that can be derived from the _ herschel - spire _ observations at 857 ghz are of the order of @xmath13 erg .",
    "modern ground - based sz observatories , such as _ alma _ ( the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ) , can also provide us with the constraints on the thermal energy of high temperature electrons stored in agn cocoons . _",
    "alma _ will consist of a giant array of 12-m antennas and an additional compact array of 7-m and 12-m antennas to greatly enhance alma s ability to image extended targets .",
    "high spatial resolution and sensitivity makes this instrument promising for the imaging of agn cocoons . in the initial phase of _ alma _ operations ,",
    "the antennas will be equipped with at least four receiver bands : 84 - 116 ghz , 211 - 275 ghz , 275 - 373 ghz , and 602 - 720 ghz . here , we study the possibility to detect the sz effect from agn cocoons at frequencies of 90 and 217 ghz with _",
    "alma_. we consider only these frequencies because the observations at higher frequencies become excessively time - consuming owing to the narrower beam size and the higher system temperature .",
    "to calculate the upper limits on the thermal energy of 100 - 400 kev electrons that can be obtained with _ alma _ , we use the alma observation support tool ( heywood et al .",
    "we found that the sensitivity in units of @xmath7 of @xmath14 at 90 ghz can be obtained with an integration time of 10 hrs , while the sensitivity of @xmath7 of @xmath15 at 217 ghz can be obtained with an integration time of 120 hrs .",
    "the local minimums of the relativistic spectral functions at 90 ghz and 217 ghz in the temperature range of ( 100 kev , 400 kev ) were taken from prokhorov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and the angular size of an agn cocoon was chosen to be equal 0.5@xmath16 .",
    "the spatial resolution of _ alma _ is 5 arcsec at 90 ghz and 2 arcsec at 217 ghz .",
    "therefore , _ alma _ will allow us to put tighter constraints on the energy of high temperature electrons than those that can be obtained with _ planck _ and _ herschel _ , and to study the internal structure of agn cocoons .",
    "* * hard x - ray observations *    the sz effect is not the only mechanism to test the presence of electron populations in agn cocoons .",
    "hard x - ray observatories , such as _ suzaku _ and the future mission _",
    "astro - h _ , are sensitive up to energies of several hundred kev . here",
    ", we compare the hard x - ray luminosities of giant agn cocoons produced by high temperature gas via bremsstrahlung emission and by nonthermal ultra - relativistic electrons via inverse compton ( ic ) emission and show that the efficiency of ic emission is sigficantly higher than that of bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore , measurements of hard x - rays from agn cocoons will allow us to test for the presence of nonthermal ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "the luminosity of an agn cocoon produced by high temperature gas via bremsstrahlung emission is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fine structure constant , @xmath19 is the classical electron radius , @xmath20 is the volume of high temperature gas , and @xmath21 is the corrections for dipole and quadrupole radiation ( see , e.g. , khvesyuk et al .",
    "1998 ) taking into account quantum and relativistic effects . to calculate the value of bremsstrahlung luminosity",
    ", we assume that the gas volume equals @xmath22 @xmath23 , the gas temperature is @xmath24 kev , and the gas density is @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "these values are approximately equal to those found in our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the calculated value of bremsstrahlung luminosity is @xmath27 erg s@xmath6 .    to calculate the ic luminosity of the ultra - relativistic electron population that can significantly contribute to the pressure of agn cocoons",
    ", we consider an agn cocoon filled by ultra - relativistic electrons with a lorentz factor of @xmath28 that is required to produce 300 kev photons through scattering of ultra - relativistic electrons off cmb photons ( see , e.g. , ginzburg 1979 ) .",
    "the ic luminosity of the ultra - relativistic electron population is given by ( see , e.g. , ginzburg 1979 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy density of the cmb , @xmath31 is the total energy in nonthermal ultra - relativistic electrons . assuming the population of nonthermal ultra - relativistic electrons fills the volume of @xmath22 @xmath23 and its pressure equals that of the simulated agn cocoon , the calculated value of ic luminosity is @xmath32 erg s@xmath6 and is four orders of magnitude greater than that of bremsstrahlung emission from the 300 kev gas .",
    "therefore , it is highly unlikely that the emission of 300 kev gas via bremsstrahlung can be constrained through x - ray observations if the dynamically subdominate population of nonthermal ultra - relativistic electrons , that contributes @xmath330.01% to the pressure , is present in agn cocoons .",
    "giant x - ray cavities have been discovered by _",
    "chandra _ in clusters of galaxies , such as ms 0735 + 7421 at a redshift z=0.22 ( mcnamara et al . 2005 ) and hercules a at z=0.154 ( nulsen et al .",
    "these cavities could be created by powerful agn outflows with jet kinetic power of @xmath34 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "similar x - ray surface brightness depression regions have been observed in the galaxy cluster abell 2204 at a redshift of 0.152 and the jet s kinetic power of @xmath35 erg s@xmath6 should be necessary to create such regions ( sanders et al .",
    "another example is the intermediate redshift ( z=0.29 ) cluster gas associated with the fr ii radio galaxy 3c 438 ( see kraft et al .",
    "2007 ) , the observed surface brightness discontinuity in the gas that extends @xmath3600 kpc can be the result of an extremely powerful outburst which is even more powerful than those seen in the nearby clusters ms 0735 + 7421 , hydra a , and hercules a.    the standard evolutionary scenario for agns suggests that their jets are enveloped in a cocoon ( scheuer 1974 ; blandford & rees 1974 ) .",
    "modern hydrodynamical simulations led to the conclusion that the gas density is very low and gas temperature is very high , @xmath36 k , in agn cocoons .",
    "therefore , a significant x - ray depression is predicted towards agn cocoons .",
    "x - ray cavities often coincide with the radio lobes of the central radio galaxy , although the non - thermal pressure derived from the equipartition condition for the energy of synchrotron - radiating non - thermal electrons and magnetic fields is a factor of ten smaller than the pressures required to inflate the cavities ( e.g. ito et al .",
    "this implies that most of the energy in the cocoon is carried by an ` invisible ' component such as , e.g. , high energy thermal electrons ( ito et al . 2008 ) . observations of the sz effect have been proposed to probe the inferred dynamically - dominant component of plasma bubbles associated with x - ray cavities ( see pfrommer et al .",
    "2005 ; colafrancesco 2005 ; prokhorov et al .",
    "2010 ) , since the sz signal is proportional to the electron pressure integrated along the line - of - sight and to the value of the spectral function that depends on electron temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we present rhd simulations of the formation and evolution of agn cocoons produced by very light powerful jets .",
    "our simulations have been performed with the publicly available pluto computational code .",
    "the parameters of the simulations are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have constrained our initial conditions based on the x - ray observations of the powerful agn outburst in the ms 0735 + 7421 cluster of galaxies .",
    "the goal of our simulations is to provide a realistic model of gas pressure and temperature distributions in agn cocoons .",
    "the simulated electron pressure and temperature maps are shown in figs . 1 and 2 for the two models with different jet lifetimes or ` duty cycles ' .",
    "we have found that the derived temperatures in agn cocoons , @xmath37 k , are significantly higher than those are in the regions of shocked ambient gas and , therefore , the use of the relativistically correct sz formalism is necessary to produce the simulated sz maps of agn cocoons .",
    "we have presented the first sz intensity maps of agn cocoons at various frequencies derived from the relativistic hydrodynamical simulations and calculated in the framework of the relativistically correct sz formalism .",
    "this fully relativistic study provides us with more realistic sz maps of agn cocoons , more so than those previously obtained by adopting analytical toy models of gas pressure and temperature distributions in cocoons .",
    "we show that sz observations at frequencies of 217 ghz and at 857 ghz will provide us with a method to test the presence of very hot gas in agn cocoons .",
    "this result confirms the previous conclusions based on the analytical toy models that sz maps at 217 ghz could be used to probe the dynamically - dominant component of agn cocoons .",
    "moreover , our study demonstrates that two different regions disturbed by agn activity are present in the simulated domain , namely an agn cocoon region and a shocked ambient medium region .",
    "we show that by taking into account the presence of these two regions leads us to the conclusion that the agn cocoon is not clearly seen on the simulated sz map at a frequency of 90 ghz",
    ". therefore , sz observations at 217 ghz and at higher frequencies , such as 857 ghz , are more suitable for studying agn cocoons than those are at lower frequencies .",
    "we conclude that fully relativistic simulations of the sz effect from agn cocoons are very important , since the spectral properties of the sz signal should be taken into account in order to produce realistic sz maps of cocoons .",
    "we have considered the possibility of observing the sz effect from agn cocoons by means of modern instruments , such as _ planck - hfi _ , _ herschel - spire _ , and _ alma _ and have derived upper limits on the total thermal energy of high temperature electrons stored in an agn cocoon that can be obtained with these instruments ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "we have compared the derived upper limits with the thermal energy stored in the simulated cocoon ( model a ) , and have found that the upper limits ( that can be derived with _ herschel - spire _ and _ alma _ ) on the thermal energy of 100 - 400 kev electrons are close to the value of the thermal energy of electrons in the agn cocoon obtained from our simulations .",
    "therefore , agn cocoons are a suitable target for observations with modern high - resolution sz instruments .",
