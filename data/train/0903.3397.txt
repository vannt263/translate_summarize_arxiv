    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite is a non - perturbative , background independent approach to the unification of general relativity and quantum physics .",
    "one of its key features is that space - time geometry is treated quantum mechanically from the beginning .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite is constructed by applying methods of lqg to mini - superspaces obtained by a symmetry reduction of general relativity . in the homogeneous , isotropic cosmological models with a massless scalar field , quantum geometry effects of lqg",
    "have been shown to create a new repulsive force in the planck regime .",
    "the force is so strong that the big bang is replaced by a specific type of quantum bounce .",
    "the force rises very quickly once the scalar curvature reaches @xmath0 ( or matter density @xmath1 reaches @xmath2 ) to cause the bounce but also dies very quickly after the bounce once the scalar curvature and the density fall below these values . therefore outside the planck regime the quantum space - time of lqc",
    "is very well approximated by the space - time continuum of general relativity .",
    "this scenario is borne out in the k=0 , @xmath3=0 models , @xcite , @xmath40 models @xcite , the k=@xmath5 closed model @xcite , k=@xmath6 open model @xcite and the k=0 model with an inflationary potential with phenomenologically viable parameters @xcite .",
    "going beyond the big - bang and big - crunch singularities , lqc has also been used to argue that its quantum geometry effects resolve _ all _ strong curvature singularities in homogeneous , isotropic situations in which matter is a perfect fluid with an equation of state of the standard type , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "( for recent reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite . ) finally , recent investigations @xcite of gowdy models , which have an infinite number of degrees of freedom , also indicate that the big - bang is replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "detailed and viable quantum theories were constructed in the homogeneous , isotropic case using the so - called `` @xmath8 '' scheme .",
    "a key open question has been whether or not the qualitative features of their planck scale physics will persist in more realistic situations in which these strong symmetry assumptions do not hold exactly . a first step in this direction",
    "is to retain homogeneity and extend the `` improved dynamics '' of @xcite to anisotropic situations . in the isotropic case ,",
    "there is only one non - trivial curvature invariant , the ( space - time ) scalar curvature ( or , equivalently , matter density ) . in anisotropic situations",
    "weyl curvature is non - zero and it too diverges at the big bang .",
    "therefore , now one can enter the planck regime in several inequivalent ways which suggests that the planck scale physics would now be much richer .    in this paper",
    "we will continue the lqc explorations of this issue by analyzing in detail the simplest of anisotropic models , the bianchi i cosmologies .",
    "( previous work on this model is discussed below . ) as in the isotropic case we will use a massless scalar field as the matter source , and it will continue to provide the `` relational '' or `` internal '' time a la leibniz with respect to which other physical quantities of interest e.g . , curvatures , shears , expansion and matter density `` evolve '' . again , as in the isotropic case , the framework can be further extended to accommodate additional matter fields in a rather straightforward fashion .",
    "although the bianchi i models are the simplest among anisotropic cosmologies , results obtained in the context of the belinskii , khalatnikov , lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite suggest that they are perhaps the most interesting ones for the issue of singularity resolution .",
    "the bkl conjecture states that , as one approaches space - like singularities in general relativity , terms with time derivatives would dominate over those with spatial derivatives , implying that the asymptotic dynamics would be well described by an ordinary differential equation . by",
    "now considerable evidence has accumulated in favor of this conjecture @xcite . for the case when the matter source is a massless scalar field in full general relativity without any symmetry assumption , these results suggest that , as the system enters the planck regime , dynamics along any fixed spatial point would be well described by a bianchi i metric . therefore understanding",
    "the fate of bianchi i models in lqc could provide substantial intuition for what happens to generic space - like singularities in lqg @xcite .",
    "indeed , in cosmological contexts where one has approximate homogeneity , a natural strategy in full lqg is to divide the spatial 3-manifold into small , elementary cells and assume that there is homogeneity in each cell , with fields changing slowly as one moves from one cell to the next .",
    "( for an exploration along these lines in the older `` @xmath9 scheme , '' see @xcite . ) now , if one were to assume that geometry in each elementary cell is also isotropic , then the weyl tensor in each cell and therefore everywhere would be forced to be zero . a natural strategy to accommodate realistic ,",
    "non - vanishing weyl curvature would be to use bianchi i geometry in each cell and let the parameters @xmath10 vary slowly from one cell to another . in this manner ,",
    "lqc of the bianchi i model can pave way to the analysis of the fate of generic space - like singularities of general relativity in full lqg .",
    "because of these potential applications , bianchi i models have already drawn considerable attention in lqc ( see in particular @xcite ) . during these investigations , groundwork was laid down which we will use extensively . however , in the spatially non - compact context ( i.e. , when the spatial topology is @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 ) , the construction of the quantum hamiltonian constraint turned out to be problematic .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint used in the early work has the same difficulties as those encountered in the `` @xmath9-scheme '' in the isotropic case ( see , e.g. , @xcite , or appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "more recent papers have tried to overcome these limitations by mimicking the `` @xmath8 '' scheme used successfully in the isotropic case .",
    "however , to make concrete progress , at a key point in the analysis a simplifying assumption was made without a systematic justification .",
    "be proportional to @xmath13 . in the anisotropic case ,",
    "one has three @xmath14 and quantum dynamics requires the introduction of three @xmath15 . in the bianchi i case",
    "now under consideration , it was simply assumed @xcite that @xmath15 be proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "we will see in section [ s3.2 ] that a more systematic procedure leads to the conclusion that the correct generalization of the isotropic result is more subtle .",
    "for example , @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 . ]",
    "unfortunately , it leads to quantum dynamics which depends , even to leading order , on the choice of an auxiliary structure ( i.e. , the fiducial cell ) used in the construction of the hamiltonian framework @xcite .",
    "this is a major conceptual drawback .",
    "also , the final results inherit certain features that are not physically viable ( e.g. the dependence of the quantum bounce on `` directional densities '' in @xcite ) .",
    "we will provide a systematic treatment of quantum dynamics that is free from these drawbacks .    to achieve this goal one has to overcome rather non - trivial obstacles which had stalled progress for the past two years .",
    "this requires significant new inputs .",
    "the first is conceptual : we will sharpen the correspondence between lqg and lqc that underlies the definition of the curvature operator @xmath19 in terms of holonomies .",
    "the holonomies we are led to use in this construction will have a non - trivial dependence on triads , stemming from the choice of loops on which they are evaluated ( see footnote 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "at first it seems very difficult to define the action of the resulting quantum holonomy operators .",
    "indeed this was the primary technical obstacle that forced earlier investigations to take certain short cuts the assumption mentioned above while defining @xmath19 .",
    "the second new input is the definition of these holonomy operators without having to take a recourse to such short cuts .",
    "but then the resulting hamiltonian constraint appears unwieldy at first .",
    "the third major input is a rearrangement of configuration variables that makes the constraint tractable both analytically , as in this paper , and for the numerical work in progress @xcite .",
    "finally , we will find that the resulting hamiltonian constraint has a striking feature which could provide a powerful new tool in relating the quantum dynamics of more complicated models to that of simpler models .",
    "it turns out that , in lqc , there is a well - defined projection from the bianchi i physical states to the friedmann physical states which maps the bianchi i quantum dynamics _",
    "exactly _ to the isotropic quantum dynamics .",
    "previous investigations of the relation between quantum dynamics of a more complicated model to that of a simpler model generally began with an embedding of the hilbert space @xmath20 of the more restricted model in the hilbert space @xmath21 of the more general model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in generic situations , the image of @xmath20 under this embedding was not left invariant by the more general dynamics on @xmath21 .",
    "this led to a concern that the physics resulting from first reducing and then quantizing may be completely different from that obtained by quantizing the larger system and regarding the smaller system as its sub - system .",
    "the new idea of projecting from @xmath21 to @xmath20 corresponds to `` integrating out the degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to the restricted model '' while the embedding @xmath20 in to @xmath21 corresponds to `` freezing by hand '' these extra degrees of freedom .",
    "classically , both are equally good procedures and in fact the embedding is generally easier to construct .",
    "however , in quantum mechanics it is more appropriate to integrate out the `` extra '' degrees of freedom . in the present case ,",
    "one `` integrates out '' anisotropies to go from the lqc of the bianchi i models to that of the friedmann model .",
    "this idea was already proposed and used in @xcite in a perturbative treatment of anisotropies in locally rotationally symmetric , diagonal , bianchi i model .",
    "we extend that work in that we consider the full quantum dynamics of diagonal bianchi i model without additional symmetries and , furthermore , use the analog of the `` @xmath8 scheme '' in which the quantum constraint is considerably more involved than in the `` @xmath9-type '' scheme used in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the lqc dynamics of the friedmann model is recovered exactly provides some concrete support for the hope that lqc may capture the essential features of full lqg , as far as the quantum dynamics of the homogeneous , isotropic degree of freedom is concerned .",
    "the material is organized as follows .",
    "we will begin in section [ s2 ] with an outline of the classical dynamics of bianchi i models",
    ". this overview will not be comprehensive as our goal is only to set the stage for the quantum theory which is developed in section [ s3 ] .",
    "in section [ s4 ] we discuss three key properties of quantum dynamics : the projection map mentioned above , agreement of the lqc dynamics with that of the wheeler dewitt theory away from the planck regime and effective equations .",
    "( the isotropic analogs of these equations approximate the full lqc dynamics of friedmann models extremely well . ) in section [ s4 ] we summarize the main results and discuss some of their ramifications .",
    "the appendix [ a1 ] discusses parity type discrete symmetries which play an important role in the analysis of quantum dynamics .",
    "in this section we will summarize those aspects of the classical theory that will be needed for quantization . for a more complete description of the classical dynamics see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our space - time manifold @xmath22 will be topologically @xmath23 . as is standard in the literature on bianchi models",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to _ diagonal _ bianchi i metrics . then one can fix cartesian coordinates @xmath24 on @xmath22 and express the space - time metric as : [ metric ] ds^2 = -n^2 d^2 + a_1 ^ 2 dx_1 ^ 2 + a_2 ^ 2 dx_2 ^ 2 + a_3 ^ 2 dx_3 ^ 2 , where @xmath25 is the lapse and @xmath26 are the directional scale factors .",
    "thus , the dynamical degrees of freedom are encoded in three functions @xmath27 of time .",
    "bianchi i symmetries permit us to rescale the three spatial coordinates @xmath28 by independent constants . under @xmath29 ,",
    "the directional scale factors transform as @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the numerical value of a directional scale factor , say @xmath31 , is not an observable ; only ratios such as @xmath32 are . the matter source will be a massless scalar field which will serve as the relational or internal time .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to work with a harmonic time function , i.e. to ask that @xmath33 satisfy @xmath34 . from now on we will work with this choice .    since the spatial manifold is non - compact and all fields are spatially homogeneous , to construct a lagrangian or a hamiltonian framework one has to introduce an elementary cell @xmath35 and restrict all integrations to it @xcite .",
    "we will choose @xmath35 so that its edges lie along the fixed coordinate axis @xmath28 .",
    "as in the isotropic case , it is also convenient to fix a fiducial flat metric @xmath36 with line element ds_o^2 = dx_1 ^ 2 + dx_2 ^ 2 + dx_3 ^ 2",
    ". we will denote by @xmath37 the determinant of this metric , by @xmath38 the lengths of the three edges of @xmath35 as measured by @xmath36 , and by @xmath39 the volume of the elementary cell @xmath35 also measured using @xmath36 .",
    "finally , we introduce fiducial co - triads @xmath40 and the triads @xmath41 dual to them . clearly they are adapted to the edges of @xmath35 and are compatible with @xmath36 ( i.e. , satisfy @xmath42 ) . as noted above , bianchi i symmetries allow each of the three coordinates to be rescaled by an independent constant @xmath43 . under these rescalings , @xmath44 , co -",
    "triads transform as @xmath45 , and triads @xmath41 are rescaled by inverse powers of @xmath43 .",
    "the fiducial metric is transformed to @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 .",
    "_ we must ensure that our physical results do not change under these rescalings .",
    "_ finally , the physical co - triads are given by @xmath48 and the physical 3-metric @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 .",
    "with these fiducial structures at hand , we can now introduce the phase space .",
    "recall first that in lqg the canonical pair consists of an @xmath51 connection @xmath52 and a triad @xmath53 of density weight one . using the bianchi i symmetry , from each gauge equivalence class of these pairs we can select one and only one , given by : [ var ] a_a^i = : c^i ( l^i)^-1 _ a^i , e^a_i q e^a_i = : p_i l_i v_o^-1 ^a_i , where @xmath54 are constants and @xmath55 is the determinant of the physical spatial metric @xmath49 .",
    "_ thus the connections @xmath52 are now labelled by three parameters @xmath56 and the triads @xmath53 by three parameters @xmath14 . _",
    "if @xmath14 are positive , the physical triad @xmath57 and the fiducial triad @xmath41 have the same orientation .",
    "a change in sign of , say , @xmath58 corresponds to a change in the orientation of the physical triad brought about by the flip @xmath59 .",
    "these flips are gauge transformations because they do not change the physical metric @xmath49 .",
    "the momenta @xmath14 are directly related to the directional scale factors : [ a&p ] p_1 = ( a_1)|a_2a_3| l_2l_3 , p_2 = ( a_2)|a_1a_3|l_1l_3 , p_3= ( a_3)|a_1a_2| l_1l_2 . where we take the directional scale factor @xmath26 to be positive if the triad vector @xmath57 is parallel to @xmath41 and negative if it is anti - parallel .",
    "as we will see below , in any solution to the field equations , the connection components @xmath60 are directly related to the time derivatives of @xmath26 .",
    "the factors of @xmath38 in ( [ var ] ) ensure that this parametrization is unchanged if the fiducial co - triad , triad and metric are rescaled via @xmath61 .",
    "however , the parametrization does depend on the choice of the cell @xmath35 .",
    "thus the situation is the same as in the isotropic case @xcite .",
    "( the physical fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 are of course insensitive to changes in the fiducial metric _ or _ the cell . ) to evaluate the symplectic structure of the symmetry reduced theory , as in the isotropic case @xcite , we begin with the expression of the symplectic structure in the full theory and simply restrict the integration to the cell @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting ( non - vanishing ) poisson brackets are given by : [ pb ] \\{c^i , p_j } = 8g^i_j .",
    "to summarize , the phase space in the bianchi i model is six dimensional , coordinatized by pairs @xmath62 , subject to the poisson bracket relations ( [ pb ] ) .",
    "this description is tied to the choice of the fiducial cell @xmath35 but is insensitive to the choice of fiducial triads , co - triads and metrics .",
    "next , let us consider constraints .",
    "the full theory has a set of three constraints : the gauss , the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "it is straightforward to check that , because we have restricted ourselves to diagonal metrics and fixed the internal gauge , the gauss and the diffeomorphism constraints are identically satisfied .",
    "we are thus left with just the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "its expression is obtained by restricting the integration in the full theory to the fiducial cell @xmath35 : [ ham1 ] _ h = _ + _ = _ n ( _ + _ ) ^3x where @xmath25 is the lapse function and the gravitational and the matter parts of the constraint densities are given by _",
    "= ( ^ij_k f_ab^k -2(1+^2)k_[a^ik_b]^j ) _ = _ . here",
    "@xmath63 is the barbero - immirzi parameter , @xmath64 is the curvature of the connection @xmath52 , given by f_ab^k = 2_[aa_b]^k + _ ij^ka_a^ia_b^j , @xmath65 is related to the extrinsic curvature @xmath66 via @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the energy density of the matter fields . in general",
    ", @xmath52 is related to @xmath65 and the spin connection @xmath69 defined by the triad @xmath57 via @xmath70 . however , because bianchi i models are spatially flat , @xmath71 in the gauge chosen in ( [ var ] ) , whence @xmath72 .",
    "this property and the fact that spatial derivatives of @xmath65 vanish by the bianchi i symmetry leads us to the relation 2k_[a^ik_b]^j=^-2^ij_kf_ab^k .",
    "therefore , the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint can be simplified : @xmath73 finally , recall that our matter field is a massless scalar field @xmath74 .",
    "the matter energy density of the scalar field @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the physical volume of the elementary cell .",
    "our choice of harmonic time @xmath33 implies that the lapse function is given by @xmath78 . with these choices the constraint ( [ ham1 ] ) simplifies further : @xmath79 physical states of the classical theory lie on the constraint surface @xmath80 .",
    "the time evolution of each @xmath14 and @xmath60 is obtained by taking their poisson bracket with @xmath81 .",
    "[ dp1 ] = \\{p_1,_h } = -8 g = ( p_2c_2+p_3c_3 ) ; [ dc1 ] = \\{c_1,_h } = 8 g = ( p_2c_2+p_3c_3 ) .",
    "the four other time derivatives can be obtained via permutations .",
    "although the phase space coordinates @xmath62 themselves depend on the choice of the fiducial cell @xmath35 , the dynamical equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 and hence also for the physical metric @xmath49 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath66 that follow from ( [ dp1 ] ) and ( [ dc1 ] ) _ are independent of this choice . _    combining eqs .",

    "next , it is convenient to introduce a mean scale factor @xmath88 which encodes the physical volume element but ignores anisotropies",
    ". then , the mean hubble parameter is given by [ hubble ] h : = = ( h_1+h_2+h_3 ) , h_i : = .",
    "squaring eq .",
    "( [ hubble ] ) and using the implication h_1h_2 + h_2h_3+h_3h_1 = 8 g _ of the hamiltonian constraint , we obtain the generalized friedmann equation for bianchi i space - times , [ friedc ] h^2 = _ + , where [ sigma ] ^2 = is the shear term . the right hand side of ( [ friedc ] ) brings out the fact that the anisotropic shears @xmath89 contribute to the energy density ; they quantify the energy density in the gravitational waves .",
    "using the fact that our matter field has zero anisotropic stress one can show that @xmath90 is a constant of the motion @xcite . if the space - time itself is isotropic , then @xmath91 and eq .",
    "( [ friedc ] ) reduces to the usual friedmann equation for the standard isotropic cosmology .",
    "these considerations will be useful in interpreting quantum dynamics and exploring the relation between the bianchi i and friedmann quantum hamiltonian constraints .",
    "next , let us consider the scalar field @xmath74 . because there is no potential for it ,",
    "its canonically conjugate momentum @xmath92 is a constant of motion ( which , for definiteness , will be assumed to be positive ) .",
    "therefore , in any solution to the field equations @xmath74 grows linearly in the harmonic time @xmath33 .",
    "thus , although @xmath74 does not have the physical dimensions of time , it is a good evolution parameter in the classical theory .",
    "the form of the quantum hamiltonian constraint is such that @xmath74 will also serve as a viable internal time parameter in the quantum theory .",
    "we will conclude with a discussion of discrete ` reflection symmetries ' that will play an important role in the quantum theory .",
    "( for further details see the appendix . ) in the isotropic case , there is a single reflection symmetry , @xmath93 which physically corresponds to the orientation reversal @xmath94 of triads .",
    "these are large gauge transformations , under which the metric @xmath49 remains unchanged .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is invariant under this reflection whence one can , if one so wishes , restrict one s attention just to the sector @xmath95 of the phase space . in the bianchi i case , we have three reflections @xmath96 , each corresponding to the flip of one of the triad vectors , leaving the other two untouched ( e.g. , @xmath97 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the hamiltonian flow is left invariant under the action of each @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to restrict one s attention to the positive octant in which all three @xmath14 are non - negative : dynamics in any of the other seven octants can be easily recovered from that in the positive octant by the action of the discrete symmetries @xmath96 .    * _ remark : _ in the lqc literature on bianchi i models , a physical distinction has occasionally been made between the fiducial cells @xmath35 which are `` cubical '' with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath36 and those that are `` rectangular . ''",
    "( in the former case all @xmath38 are equal . )",
    "however , given _ any _ cell @xmath35 one can always find a flat metric in our collection ( [ metric ] ) with respect to which that @xmath35 cubical . using it as @xmath36 one would be led to call it cubical .",
    "therefore the distinction is unphysical and the hope that the restriction to cubical cells may resolve some of the physical problems faced in @xcite was misplaced .",
    "this section is divided into four parts . in the first",
    ", we briefly recall quantum kinematics , emphasizing issues that have not been discussed in the literature . in the second , we spell out a simple but well - motivated correspondence between the lqg and lqc quantum states that plays an important role in the definition of the curvature operator @xmath98 in terms of holonomies . however , the paths along which holonomies are evaluated depend in a rather complicated way on the triad ( or momentum ) operators , whence at first it seems very difficult to define these holonomy operators . in the third subsection we show that geometric considerations provide a natural avenue to overcome these apparent obstacles .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian constraint is , however , rather unwieldy to work with . in the last sub - section we make a convenient redefinition of configuration variables to simplify its action .",
    "the simplification , in turn , will provide the precise sense in which the singularity is resolved in the quantum theory .",
    "we will summarize quantum kinematics only briefly ; for details , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us begin by specifying the elementary functions on the classical phase space which are to have unambiguous analogs in the quantum theory . in lqc",
    "this choice is directly motivated by the structure of full lqg @xcite . as one might expect from the isotropic case @xcite , the elementary variables are the three momenta @xmath14 and holonomies @xmath99 along edges parallel to the three axis @xmath28 , where @xmath100 is the length of the edge with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath36 .",
    "is the length of the edge along which the holonomy is evaluated , measured in the units of the length of the edge of @xmath35 parallel to it . since @xmath101 is a ratio of lengths , its value does not depend on the fiducial or any other metric .",
    "] these functions are ( over)complete in the sense that they suffice to separate points of the phase space . taking the @xmath102 axis for concreteness , the holonomy @xmath103 has the form [ hol ] h_1^ ( ) ( c_1,c_2,c_3 ) = + 2 _ 1 where @xmath104 is the unit @xmath105 matrix and @xmath106 constitute a basis of the lie algebra of @xmath51 , satisfying @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the holonomies are completely determined by almost periodic functions @xmath108 of the connection ; they are called `` almost '' periodic because @xmath101 is any real number rather than an integer . in quantum theory , then , elementary operators @xmath109 and @xmath110 are well - defined and our task is to express other operators of physical interest in terms of these elementary ones .",
    "recall that in the isotropic case it is simplest to specify the gravitational sector of the kinematic hilbert space in the triad of @xmath111 representation : it consists of wave functions @xmath112 which are symmetric under @xmath113 and have a finite norm : @xmath114 . in the bianchi",
    "i case it is again simplest to describe @xmath115 in the momentum representation .",
    "consider first a _ countable _ linear combination , [ norm ]     @xmath116 , where p_1 , p_2 , p_3 | p_1 , p_2 , p_3= _",
    "p_1 p_1 _ p_2 p_2 _ p_3 p_3 .next , recall that on the classical phase space the three reflections @xmath96 represent large gauge transformations under which physics does not change .",
    "they have a natural induced action @xmath117 on the space of wave functions @xmath118 .",
    "( thus , for example , @xmath119 . )",
    "physical observables commute with @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , as in gauge theories , each eigenspace of @xmath117 provides a physical sector of the theory .",
    "since @xmath121 , eigenvalues of @xmath120 are @xmath122 . for definiteness , as in the isotropic case , we will assume that the wave functions @xmath118 are symmetric under @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the gravitational part @xmath115 of the kinematical hilbert space is spanned by wave functions @xmath118 satisfying [ parity ] ( p_1,p_2,p_3 ) = ( |p_1| , |p_2| , |p_3| ) which have finite norm ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "the basis states @xmath123 are eigenstates of quantum geometry : in the state @xmath116 the face @xmath124 of the fiducial cell @xmath35 orthogonal to the axis @xmath28 has area @xmath125 .",
    "note that although @xmath126 , the orthonormality holds via kronecker deltas rather than the usual dirac distributions ; this is why the lqc quantum kinematics is inequivalent to that of the schrdinger theory used in wheeler dewitt cosmology .",
    "finally the action of the elementary operators is given by : _",
    "1|p_1,p_2,p_3= p_1|p_1,p_2,p_3    @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the full kinematical hilbert space @xmath129 will be the tensor product , @xmath130 where , as in the isotropic case , we will set @xmath131 for the hilbert space of the homogeneous scalar field @xmath74 .",
    "on @xmath132 , the operator @xmath133 will act by multiplication and @xmath134 will act by differentiation .",
    "note that _ we can also use a `` polymer hilbert space '' for @xmath132 spanned by almost periodic functions of @xmath74 . _",
    "the quantum hamiltonian constraint ( [ qham4 ] ) will remain unchanged and our construction of the physical hilbert space will go through as it is @xcite .      to discuss quantum dynamics , we have to construct the quantum analog of the hamiltonian constraint . since there is no operator corresponding to the connection coefficients @xmath60 on @xmath115 , we can not use ( [ ham3 ] ) directly .",
    "rather , as in the isotropic case @xcite , we will return to the expression ( [ ham2 ] ) involving curvature @xmath64 .",
    "our task then is to find the operator on @xmath115 corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "as is usual in lqg , the idea is to first express the curvature in terms of our elementary variables holonomies and triads and then replace them by their direct quantum analogs .",
    "recall first that , in the classical theory , the @xmath135-@xmath136 component of @xmath64 can be written in terms of holonomies around a plaquette ( i.e. , a rectangular closed loop whose edges are parallel to two of the axes @xmath28 ) : [ f1 ] f_ab^k = 2_ar_0 ( ^k)^o_a^i^o_b^j , where @xmath137 is the area of the plaquette @xmath138 and the holonomy @xmath139 around the plaquette @xmath140 is given by [ holonomy ] h__ij= h_j^(|_j)^-1 h_i^(|_i)^-1 h_j^(|_j ) h_i^(|_i ) where @xmath141 is the length of the @xmath142th edge of the plaquette , as measured by the fiducial metric @xmath36 .",
    "( there is no summation over @xmath143 . ) because the @xmath144 is shrunk to zero , the limit is not sensitive to the precise choice of the closed plaquette @xmath138 .",
    "now , in lqg the connection operator does not exist , whence if we regard the right side of ( [ f1 ] ) as an operator , the limit fails to converge in @xmath115 .",
    "the non - existence of the connection operator is a direct consequence of the underlying diffeomorphism invariance @xcite and is intertwined with the fact that the eigenvalues of geometric operators such as the area operator @xmath145 associated with the plaquette under consideration are purely discrete .",
    "therefore , in lqc the viewpoint is that the non - existence of the limit @xmath146 in quantum theory is not accidental : quantum geometry is simply telling us that we should shrink the plaquette not till the area it encloses goes to zero , but rather only to the minimum non - zero eigenvalue @xmath147 of the area operator ( where @xmath148 is a dimensionless number ) .",
    "the resulting quantum operator @xmath98 then inherits planck scale non - localities .    to implement this strategy in full lqg",
    "one must resolve a difficult issue .",
    "if the plaquette is to be shrunk only to a finite size , the operator on the right side of ( [ f1 ] ) would depend on what that limiting plaquette is .",
    "so , which of the many plaquettes enclosing an area @xmath147 should one use ? without a well - controlled gauge fixing procedure",
    ", it would be very difficult to single out such plaquettes , one for each 2-dimensional plane in the tangent space at each spatial point .",
    "however , in the diagonal bianchi i case now under consideration , a natural gauge fixing is available and indeed we have already carried it out .",
    "thus , in the @xmath87-@xmath142 plane , it is natural to choose a plaquette @xmath140 so that its edges are parallel to the @xmath28-@xmath149 axis .",
    "furthermore , the underlying homogeneity implies that it suffices to introduce the three plaquettes at any one point in our spatial 3-manifold .",
    "these considerations severely limit the choice of plaquettes @xmath140 but they do not determine the lengths of the two edges in each of these plaquettes . to completely determine the plaquettes , as in the isotropic case , we will use a simple but well - motivated correspondence between kinematic states in lqg and those in lqc .",
    "however , because of anisotropies , new complications arise which require that the correspondence be made much more precise .",
    "fix a state @xmath123 in @xmath115 of lqc . in this state ,",
    "the three faces of the fiducial cell @xmath35 orthogonal to the @xmath28-axis have areas @xmath125 in the lqc _ quantum _ geometry .",
    "this is the complete physical information in the ket @xmath123 .",
    "how would this quantum geometry be represented in full lqg ?",
    "first , the macroscopic geometry must be spatially homogeneous and we have singled out three axes with respect to which our metrics are diagonal .",
    "therefore , semi - heuristic considerations suggest that the corresponding lqg quantum geometry state should be represented by a spin network consisting of edges parallel to the three axes ( see fig .",

    ", following @xcite , we could have repeated the strategy used successfully in the isotropic case in @xcite to simplify dynamics by carrying out a fourier transform to pass to variables which are conjugate to @xmath236 . however , as remarked earlier , that choice of @xmath15 is inadmissible and hence the strategy can not be repeated in the bianchi i case .",
    "nonetheless , it is still feasible to carry out numerical simulations . for",
    ", if one knows the support of the quantum state at an initial time @xmath216 and the number of time - steps across which one wants to evolve , one can calculate the number of points on a ( irregular ) grid in the @xmath201-@xmath229 plane on which the wave function will have support .",
    "numerical work has in fact already commenced @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the efficient algorithms that have been introduced in the context of regular lattices @xcite can be extended to this case .",
    "we will conclude this discussion by noting that it is possible to read off some qualitative features of dynamics from ( [ qham6 ] )  ( [ qham8 ] ) .",
    "since the steps in @xmath184 of this difference equation are the same as those in the isotropic case , the dynamics of volume and also of the matter density @xmath276 , since @xmath277 is a constant of motion would be qualitatively similar to that in the isotropic case .",
    "what about anisotropies ?",
    "the @xmath278 ( @xmath279 ) do not feature in the overall numerical factors in ( [ qham6 ] ) ; they appear only in the argument of the wave functions . under the action of @xmath213",
    ", these arguments get rescaled by factors @xmath280 and @xmath281 . for large volumes , or more precisely low densities ,",
    "these factors go as @xmath282 .",
    "hence , to leading order , we will recover of the classical result that @xmath283 are constants , where @xmath26 are the directional scale factors and @xmath284 , the directional hubble parameters .",
    "since quantum corrections go as @xmath285 they are utterly negligible away from the planck regime .    in the next section",
    "we will discuss three important features of dynamics dictated by ( [ qham6 ] ) which provide significant physical intuition in complementary directions .",
    "this section is divided into three parts .",
    "since we have used the same general procedure as in the isotropic case it is natural to ask how the quantum dynamics of ( [ qham6 ] ) compares to that in @xcite . in the first part",
    "we show that there is a natural projection from a dense subspace of the physical hilbert space of the bianchi i model to that of the friedmann model which maps the bianchi i hamiltonian constraint to that of the friedmann model",
    ". this result boosts confidence in the overall coherence and reliability of the quantization scheme used in lqc . in various isotropic models",
    "@xcite , one can derive certain effective equations .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , for states which are semi - classical at a late initial time , they faithfully capture quantum dynamics throughout the entire evolution , including the bounce .",
    "the same considerations lead to effective equations in bianchi i models which were already analyzed by chiou and vandersloot in appendix c of @xcite . in the second sub - section",
    "we briefly discuss these equations and their consequences . in the third ,",
    "we show that , as in the isotropic case @xcite , there is a precise sense in which the lqc quantum dynamics reduces to that of the wheeler - dewitt theory in the low curvature regime .",
    "the problem of comparing dynamics of a more general system with that of a restricted , symmetry reduced one has been discussed in the literature in several contexts . in the classical theory ,",
    "symmetric states often provide symplectic sub - manifolds @xmath286 of the more general phase spaces @xmath287 .",
    "furthermore @xmath286 are preserved by the dynamics on @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to repeat the same strategy in the quantum theory . indeed ,",
    "sometimes it is possible to find natural sub - spaces @xmath288 of states with additional symmetry in the full hilbert space @xmath289 of the more general system .",
    "however , generically @xmath288 is not left invariant by the more general dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in our case , one can introduce an isotropic sub - space of @xmath288 in the quantum theory based on any given fiducial cell @xmath35 : isotropic states correspond to wave functions @xmath243 which have support only at points @xmath290 .",
    "( but note that this sub - space is not invariantly defined ; it is tied to @xmath35 ! ) it is easy to check that the space @xmath288 of these states is not left invariant by the bianchi i quantum dynamics ( [ qham6 ] ) .    however , this fact can not be interpreted as saying that there is no simple relation between the quantum dynamics of the two theories : since restriction to @xmath288 amounts to a sharp freezing of anisotropic degrees of freedom , in view of the quantum uncertainty principle , this procedure is not well suited to compare the quantum dynamics of the two systems . as pointed out in section [ s1 ] , a better strategy is to integrate out the extra , anisotropic degrees of freedom .",
    "this would correspond to a _ projection map _ from @xmath289 to @xmath288 rather than an embedding of @xmath288 into @xmath289 .",
    "consider first , as an elementary example , a particle moving in @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that the potential depends only on @xmath291 so that dynamics has a symmetry in the @xmath292 directions . in the classical theory ,",
    "there are several natural embeddings of the phase space @xmath286 into @xmath287 .",
    "for example , we can set @xmath293 ( @xmath294=@xmath295 , @xmath296=@xmath297,@xmath291 ; @xmath298=0 , @xmath299=0 , @xmath300 ) and the hamiltonian vector field of the full theory is then tangential to the images of each of these embeddings .",
    "however , in the quantum theory the hilbert space @xmath289 of the full system is @xmath301 and there is no natural embedding @xmath302 .",
    "the classical strategy would suggest setting @xmath303 but this is not a normalizable state in @xmath289 for any @xmath304 .",
    "even if one were to ignore this fact and try to evolve these states , one would find that they are not preserved by the full hamiltonian operator @xmath305 .",
    "note however that there _ is _ a natural projection @xmath306 from a dense subspace in @xmath289 to that in @xmath288 : ( x , y , z ) ( )(z ) : = dxdy ( x , y , z ) ( z ) .",
    "( for example , we can choose the dense subspace to be the space of smooth functions of compact support . ) furthermore , under this projection , the hamiltonian operator @xmath307 of the general system is mapped to the hamiltonian operator @xmath308 of the reduced system .",
    "hence solutions @xmath309 of the schrdinger equation of the full system are mapped to solutions @xmath310 of the reduced system .",
    "finally , this projection strategy continues to work for more general hamiltonians of the type @xmath311 which again have a symmetry in the @xmath292 directions .",
    "let us return to the bianchi i model and define a projection @xmath306 from states @xmath243 of the bianchi i model to the states @xmath312 of the friedmann model of @xcite as follows : [ proj ] ( _1 , _2 , v ) ( )(v ) : = _ _1,_2 ( _1,_2,v ) ( v ) .(the idea of using such a map already appeared in @xcite where the map was defined between elements of @xmath313 of the locally rotationally symmetric bianchi i model and that of the friedmann model . ) again , @xmath306 is a well defined projection from a dense subspace of the bianchi i hilbert space to a dense subspace of the friedmann hilbert space , consisting , for example , of states which have support only on a finite number of points .",
    "as is manifest from ( [ proj ] ) , its effect is to focus on volume by `` integrating out '' the anisotropic degrees of freedom with the same volume . applying this projection map @xmath306 to eq .",
    "( [ qham6 ] ) , we find @xmath314 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is _ precisely _ the quantum constraint describing the lqc dynamics of the friedmann model with lapse , the analysis in @xcite began with the lapse @xmath315 and therefore leads to a slightly different factor ordering .",
    "had one used @xmath316 from the beginning as in the current paper , one would have obtained the factor ordering used in @xcite .",
    "( [ projham ] ) matches exactly with that constraint . ]",
    "the reason for the exact agreement is two - fold .",
    "first , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath213 of the bianchi i model is a difference operator whose coefficients depend _ only _ on @xmath184 and , second , the shift in the argument is dictated _ only _ by @xmath184 .",
    "thus , conceptually , @xmath318 are `` inert directions '' in the same sense that @xmath292 are in the elementary example discussed above .",
    "to summarize , there is a simple and _",
    "exact_ relation between quantum dynamics of the two theories .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate if this result admits a suitable extension to other bianchi models @xcite .    in completely general situations , of course",
    ", this exact agreement will not persist : the projected dynamics will provide extremely non - trivial corrections to the dynamics of the simpler system . however , the bkl conjecture says that the dynamics of general relativity greatly simplifies near space - like singularities : in this regime , the time evolution at any one spatial point is well modelled by that of bianchi i cosmology .",
    "therefore , in a large class of situations there may well be a sense in which the quantum dynamics in the deep planck regime can be projected to that of the friedmann model with only small corrections .",
    "if so , the planck scale quantum dynamics of the isotropic , homogeneous degree of freedom in the full theory will be much simpler than what one would have a priori expected .",
    "physically , the most interesting quantum states are those that are sharply peaked at a classical trajectory at late times .",
    "as explained in section [ s1 ] , in the isotropic case such states remain peaked at certain effective trajectories at _ all times _ , including the epoch during which the universe undergoes a quantum bounce .",
    "thus , even in the deep planck regime quantum physics is well captured by a smooth metric although its dynamics can no longer be approximated by the classical einstein s equations and its components now contain large , @xmath319-dependent terms .",
    "the effective equations obeyed by these geometries were first derived using ideas from geometrical quantum mechanics @xcite . however , the assumptions made in these derivations break down in the deep planck regime",
    ". therefore a priori there was no reason to expect these equations to describe quantum dynamics so well also in the planck regime . that they do was first shown by numerical simulations of the exact quantum equations @xcite in the k=0 , @xmath3=0 case .",
    "it was then realized that this model is in fact exactly soluble @xcite and the power of the effective equations could be attributed to this property .",
    "however , k=0 models with _ non - zero _ cosmological constant and the closed k=1 models do not appear to be exactly soluble . yet , numerical solutions of the exact quantum equations show that the effective equations continue to capture full quantum dynamics extremely well @xcite .",
    "new light was shed on this phenomenon by recent work on a path integral formulation of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the idea here is to return to the original derivation of path integrals due to feynman and hibbs @xcite starting from quantum mechanics . in the isotropic case , then , the strategy is to _ begin _ with the kinematics and dynamics of lqc and then rewrite the transition amplitudes as path integrals .",
    "the resulting framework has several novel features .",
    "first , because the lqc kinematics relies on quantum geometry , paths that feature in the final integral are different from what one would have naively expected from the wheeler - dewitt theory .",
    "second , the action that features in the measure is not the einstein - hilbert action but contains non - trivial quantum corrections . when expressed in the phase space language",
    ", @xmath320 , the `` hamiltonian '' @xmath321 turns out to be precisely the effective hamiltonian constraint derived in @xcite , even though this casting of the lqc transition amplitudes in the path integral language is exact and does not pre - suppose that we are away from the planck regime .",
    "now , in the path integral approach , we have the following general paradigm .",
    "consider the equations obtained by varying the action that appears in the path integral .",
    "( generally these are just the classical equations but in lqc they turn out to be the effective equations of @xcite . )",
    "fix a path representing a solution to these equations .",
    "if the action evaluated along this path is large compared to @xmath319 then that solution is a good approximation to full quantum dynamics .",
    "if one applies this idea to isotropic lqc , one is led to conclude that solutions to the effective equations of @xcite should be good approximations to full quantum dynamics also in the k=0 , @xmath40 and k=1 cases .",
    "this is precisely what one finds in numerical simulations .",
    "thus , the path integral approach may well provide a deeper explanation of the power of effective equations .",
    "while such a path integral analysis is yet to be carried out in detail in the anisotropic case , because of the situation in the simpler cases it is of considerable interest to find effective equations and study their implications .",
    "this task was carried out already by chiou and vandersloot in the appendix c of @xcite .",
    "we will summarize the relevant results and briefly comment on the general picture that emerges .    without loss of generality",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to the positive octant .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian constraint is given simply by the direct classical analog of ( [ qham1 ] ) : [ eff - ham1 ] ^2 + ^eff _ = 0 where [ eff - ham2 ] _ ^eff= - .",
    "since @xmath322 is bounded by 1 for all @xmath294 , these equations immediately imply that the matter density , @xmath323 can never become greater than the critical density @xmath324 , first found in the isotropic case @xcite .",
    "since @xmath325 becomes infinite at the big bang singularity in the classical evolution , there is a precise sense in which the singularity is resolved in the effective theory .",
    "effective equations are obtained via poisson brackets as in section [ s2 ] but using ( [ eff - ham1 ] ) in place of the classical hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this gives , for example , [ pdot ] = ( |_1c_1)(|_2c_2+|_3c_3 ) , and @xmath326.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations for @xmath327 and @xmath328 are obtained by cyclic permutations .",
    "these effective equations include `` leading order quantum corrections '' to the classical evolution equations ( [ dp1 ] ) and ( [ dc1 ] ) . in any solution , these corrections become negligible in the distant past and in the distant future . as we noted in section [ s2 ] , the shear @xmath329 defined in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is a constant of motion in the classical theory .",
    "this is no longer the case in the effective theory .",
    "however , one can show that it remains finite throughout the evolution , becomes approximately constant in the low curvature region both in the distant past and in the distant future .",
    "furthermore , its value in the distant future is the same as that in the distant past along any effective trajectory in the phase space .",
    "vandersloot ( personal communication ) has also carried out numerical integration of these equations . in the isotropic case each effective trajectory undergoes a quantum bounce when the matter density @xmath68 achieves a critical value @xmath330 .",
    "as one might expect , now the situation is more complicated because of the additional degrees of freedom .",
    "first , there are now several distinct `` bounces '' .",
    "more precisely , in addition to @xmath68 ( or the scalar curvature ) , we now have to keep track of the three hubble rates @xmath331 which directly control the weyl curvature . in the backward evolution towards the classical big bang ,",
    "einstein s equations approximate the effective equations extremely well until the density of one of the @xmath331 enters the planck regime .",
    "then the quantum corrections start rising quickly .",
    "their net effect is to dilute the quantity in question .",
    "once the quantity exits the planck regime as a result of this dilution , quantum geometry effects again become negligible . thus ,",
    "as in the isotropic case , one avoids _",
    "the ultraviolet - infrared tension @xcite because the quantum geometry effects are extremely strong in the planck regime but die off extremely quickly as the system exits this regime .",
    "secondly , the `` volume '' or the `` density bounce '' occurs when the matter density is lower than @xmath332 .",
    "this is not surprising because what matters is the total energy density and now there is also a contribution from gravitational waves . finally , although there are distinct `` bounces '' for density ( or scalar curvature ) and the @xmath331 ( or the weyl curvature invariants ) , they all occur near each other in the relational time @xmath74",
    ".    there are indications that the general scenario provided by effective equations correctly captures the qualitative features of the full quantum evolution",
    ". however , the arguments are not conclusive . for conclusive evidence for ( or against ) this picture",
    ", one needs numerical simulations @xcite of the exact quantum equations of section [ s3.4 ] , or a detailed , path integral treatment of the bianchi i models along the lines of @xcite .",
    "quantum dynamics of lqc is governed by a _ difference _",
    "rather than a _ differential_ equation because of the quantum geometry effects .",
    "however , we will now show that , as in the isotropic case @xcite , the lqc quantum dynamics is well approximated by the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) differential equation away from the planck regime where quantum geometry effects become negligible .    in the theory the directional scale factors , and hence the three @xmath191 can assume any real value and it is simpler to work with the three @xmath191 rather than with @xmath333 .",
    "let us therefore set @xmath334 and assume that @xmath335 admits a smooth extension to all real values of @xmath191 .",
    "the idea is to pair various terms in eqs .",
    "( [ qham7 ] ) and ( [ qham8 ] ) in such a way so that two of the three arguments of @xmath335 are the same .",
    "for example , one such pair is [ pair ] ( _1,_2 , _3 ; ) ( _1,_2,_3 ; ) .",
    "next , let us define @xmath336 and @xmath337 so that we have = = . ignoring the common pre - factors in eqs .",
    "( [ qham7 ] )  ( [ qham8 ] ) , the two paired terms in eq .",

    "let us ignore these corrections i.e .",
    "assume that the @xmath341 is negligible for @xmath338 because @xmath342 is slowly varying and we are in the low density , large scale - factor regime .",
    "then we find that the lqc hamiltonian constraint ( [ qham6 ] ) reduces to a rather simple differential equation : @xmath343\\big(\\sqrt{v}\\,\\ul{\\psi}(\\l_1,\\l_2,\\l_3;\\t ) \\big ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation can be further simplified by introducing @xmath344 and @xmath345 .",
    "the result is : _ ^2 ( _ 1,_2,_3 ; ) = 16 g ( _ 1,_2,_3 ; ) , where @xmath184 is now given by @xmath346 .",
    "this is precisely the equation we would have obtained if we had started from the classical hamiltonian constraint , used the schrdinger quantization and the `` covariant factor ordering '' of the constraint as in the theory .",
    "thus , the lqc hamiltonian constraint reduces to the equation under the assumption that @xmath335 is slowly varying in the sense that @xmath347 can be neglected for @xmath338 relative to the term for @xmath348 .",
    "since @xmath349 is essentially the area of the @xmath87-@xmath142 face of the fiducial cell @xmath35 in planck units , this should be an excellent approximation well away from the planck regime .",
    "however , in the planck regime itself the terms which are neglected in the lqc dynamics are comparable to the terms which are kept whence , as in the isotropic case , the evolution completely fails to approximate the lqc dynamics .",
    "in this paper we extended the `` improved '' lqc dynamics of friedmann space - times @xcite to obtain a coherent quantum theory of bianchi i models .",
    "as in the isotropic case , we restricted the matter source to be a massless scalar field since it serves as a viable relational time parameter ( a la leibniz ) both in the classical and quantum theories .",
    "however , it is rather straightforward to accommodate additional matter fields in this framework .    to incorporate the bianchi i model , we had to overcome several significant obstacles . first , using discrete symmetries we showed that to specify dynamics it suffices to focus just on the positive octant .",
    "this simplified our task considerably .",
    "second , in section [ s3.2 ] we introduced a more precise correspondence between lqg and lqc and used it to fix the parameters @xmath15 that determine the elementary plaquettes , holonomies around which define the curvature operator @xmath98 .",
    "this procedure led us to the expressions @xmath350 , etc .",
    "they reduce to the expression @xmath351 of the isotropic models @xcite . but even there , the current reasoning has the advantage that it uses only quantum geometry , avoiding reference to classical areas even in the intermediate steps .",
    "however , because of this rather complicated dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath14 , the task of defining operators @xmath176 seems hopelessly difficult at first .",
    "indeed , this was the key reason why the earlier treatments @xcite took a short cut and simply set @xmath352 by appealing to the relation @xmath353 in the isotropic case . with this choice ,",
    "quantization of the hamiltonian constraint became straightforward and the final bianchi i quantum theory resembled three copies of that of the friedmann model .",
    "however , this result had the physically unacceptable consequence that significant departures from general relativity could occur in `` tame '' situations . by a non - trivial extension of the geometrical reasoning used in the isotropic case , in section [ s3.3 ] we were able to define the operators @xmath354 for our expressions of @xmath15 . however , the structure of the resulting hamiltonian constraint turned out to be rather opaque . to simplify its form , in section [ s3.4 ] we introduced volume as one of the arguments of the wave functions .",
    "the action of the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint then became transparent : it turned out to be a difference operator where the multiplicative coefficients in individual terms depend only on volume and the change in the arguments of the wave functions also depends only on volume ; individual anisotropies do not feature ( see ( [ qham6 ] ) - ( [ qham8 ] ) ) .",
    "this simplification enabled us to show that the sector @xmath252 of quantum states which have no support on classically singular configurations is preserved by quantum dynamics . in this precise sense the big - bang singularity is resolved .",
    "furthermore , this quantum dynamics is free from the physical drawbacks of the older scheme mentioned above .",
    "in section [ s4 ] we explored three consequences of quantum dynamics in some detail .",
    "first , we showed that there is a projection map @xmath355 from the hilbert space of the more general bianchi i model to that of the more restricted friedmann model which maps the bianchi i quantum constraint _ exactly _ to the friedmann quantum constraint .",
    "this is possible because , as noted above , it is just the volume rather than the anisotropies that govern the action of the bianchi i quantum constraint .",
    "this result is of considerable interest because , in view of the bkl conjecture , it suggests that near generic space - like singularities the lqc of friedmann models may capture qualitative features of the _ full , lqg _ dynamics of the isotropic , homogeneous degree of freedom .",
    "in section [ s4.2 ] we briefly recalled the effective equations of chiou and vandersloot ( see appendix c of @xcite ) .",
    "these equations provide intuition for the rich structure of quantum bounces in the bianchi i model .",
    "their analysis suggests that classical general relativity is an excellent approximation away from the planck regime .",
    "however , in the planck regime quantum geometry effects rise steeply and forcefully counter the tendency of the classical equations to drive the matter density , the ricci scalar and weyl invariants to infinity .",
    "( in particular , as in the isotropic case , the matter density is again bounded above by @xmath356 . )",
    "thus the quantum geometry effects dilute these quantities and , once the quantity exits the planck regime , classical general relativity again becomes an excellent approximation . in section [ s4.3 ]",
    "we showed that , as in the isotropic case @xcite , there is a precise sense in which lqc dynamics is well approximated by that of the theory once quantum geometry effects become negligible .",
    "the rather complicated dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath14 is also necessary to remove a fundamental conceptual limitation of the older treatments of the bianchi i model .",
    "recall that , because we have homogeneity and the spatial topology is non - compact , we have to introduce a fiducial cell @xmath35 to construct a lagrangian or a hamiltonian framework . of course",
    ", the final physical results must be independent of this choice . at first",
    "this seems like an innocuous requirement but it turns out to be rather powerful .",
    "we will now recall from @xcite the argument that this condition is violated with the simpler choice @xmath352 but respected by the more complicated choice we were led to from lqg .",
    "for definiteness , let us fix a fiducial metric @xmath36 and denote by @xmath38 the lengths of the edges of the fiducial cell @xmath35 .",
    "suppose we were to use a different cell , @xmath357 whose edges have lengths @xmath358 ( no summation over @xmath87 ) .",
    "since the basic canonical fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 are insensitive to the choice of the cell , eq .",
    "( [ var ] ) implies that the labels @xmath60 and @xmath14 we used to characterize them change to @xmath359 , @xmath360 , etc .",
    "the gravitational part of the classical hamiltonian constraint ( [ ham3 ] ) is just rescaled by an overall factor @xmath361 and the inverse symplectic structure is rescaled by @xmath362 .",
    "hence the hamiltonian vector field is rescaled by @xmath363 , exactly as it should because the lapse is rescaled by the same factor .",
    "thus , as one would expect , the classical hamiltonian flow is insensitive to the change @xmath364 .",
    "what is the situation in the quantum theory ?",
    "physical states belong to the kernel of the hamiltonian constraint operator @xmath365 whence the two quantum theories will carry the same physics only if @xmath365 is changed at most by an overall rescaling .",
    "analysis is a bit more involved than in the classical case because @xmath213 involves factors of @xmath176 . now , under @xmath364 , our @xmath15 transform as @xmath366 , whence @xmath367 , etc , and the hamiltonian constraint ( [ qham1 ] ) is rescaled by an overall multiplicative factor @xmath361 just as in the classical theory . what happens if we set @xmath368 as in @xcite ?",
    "then , we are led to @xmath369 etc .",
    "since the constraint ( [ qham1 ] ) is a sum of terms of the type @xmath370 it has a rather uncontrolled transformation property and is not simply rescaled by an overall factor .",
    "it is then not surprising that , in the planck regime , the dynamical predictions of the resulting quantum theory ( as well as of the effective theory ) depend on the choice of the elementary cell .",
    "it is rather remarkable that the more complicated form of @xmath15 that we are led to from lqg kinematics has exactly the right form to make quantum dynamics insensitive to the choice of the fiducial cell @xmath35 .",
    "as mentioned above , it also ensures that the predictions of quantum theory is free of drawbacks of the earlier treatments @xcite , such as the correlation between the bounce and `` directional densities '' which do not have an invariant significance .    from physical considerations , as in the isotropic case",
    ", it would be most interesting to start at a `` late time '' with states that are sharply peaked at a classical solution in which the three scale factors assume values for which the curvature is `` tame '' and @xmath92 is very large compared to @xmath319 in classical units @xmath371=@xmath372=1 .",
    "one would then evolve these states backward and forward in the `` internal '' time @xmath74 .",
    "as we just discussed , analytical considerations show that , since the initial wave function is in @xmath252 , it will continue to be in that sub - space ; there is no danger that the expectation values of curvature , anisotropies or density would diverge .",
    "but several important questions remain .",
    "are there quantum bounces with a pre - big - bang branch again corresponding to a large , classical universe in the distant past ? is there is a clear distinction between evolutions of data in which there are significant initial anisotropies and data which represent only perturbations on isotropic situations ? even in the second case , do anisotropies grow ( or decay ) following predictions of the classical theory or are there noticeable deviations because of accumulations of quantum effects over large time periods",
    "? numerical simulations of the lqc equations are essential to provide confidence in the general scenario suggested by effective equations and to supply us with detailed planck scale physics .",
    "finally , let us return to full lqg .",
    "at the present stage of development , there appears to be considerable freedom in the definition of the quantum hamiltonian constraint in the full theory .",
    "furthermore , our current understanding of the _ physical implications _ of these choices is quite limited .",
    "already in the isotropic models , the `` improved '' dynamics scheme provided some useful lessons : it brought out the fact that these choices can be non - trivially narrowed down by carefully analyzing conceptual issues ( e.g. , requiring that the physical results should be independent of auxiliary structures introduced in the intermediate steps ) and by working out the physical consequences of the theory in detail ( to ensure that the quantum geometry effects are not dominant in the low energy regime ) .",
    "rather innocuous choices such as those made in arriving at the older `` @xmath9-scheme'' can lead to unacceptable consequences on both these fronts @xcite .",
    "the bianchi i analysis has sharpened these lessons considerably .",
    "the fact that the kinematical interplay between lqg and lqc has a deep impact on the viability of quantum dynamics is especially revealing . a quantum analysis of inhomogeneous perturbations around bianchi i backgrounds is therefore a promising direction for understanding the physical implications of the choices that have to be made in the definition of the hamiltonian constraint in full lqg .",
    "such an analysis is likely to narrow down choices and lead us to viable quantization schemes in lqg that lead to a good semi - classical behavior .",
    "we would like to thank martin bojowald , miguel campiglia , alejandro corichi , adam henderson , frank hermann , mercedes martn - benito , guillermo mena marugn , tomasz pawlowski , param singh , david sloan , lukasz szulc , manuel tiglio , and especially dah wei chiou and kevin vandersloot for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nsf grants phy04 - 56913 and phy0854743 , le fonds qubcois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies , the george a. and margaret m. downsbrough endowment and the eberly research funds of penn state .",
    "in this appendix we recall and extend results on parity symmetries obtained in @xcite .    in non - gravitational physics , parity transformations",
    "are normally taken to be discrete diffeomorphisms @xmath373 in the physical space which are isometries of the flat 3-metric thereon . in the phase space formulation of general relativity",
    ", we do not have a flat metric or indeed , any fixed metric .",
    "however , if the dynamical variables have internal indices such as the triads and connections used in lqg we can use the fact that the internal space @xmath374 is a vector space equipped with a flat metric @xmath375 to define parity operations on the internal indices",
    ". associated with any unit _ internal _",
    "vector @xmath376 , there is a parity operator @xmath377 which reflects the internal vectors in the 2-plane orthogonal to @xmath378 .",
    "this operation induces a natural action on triads @xmath57 , the connections @xmath52 and the conjugate momenta @xmath379 ( since they are internal vectors or co - vectors ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath57 are proper _ internal _ co - vectors while @xmath52 and @xmath380 are pseudo _ internal _ vectors and co - vectors , respectively .",
    "these geometrical considerations show that the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath63 must change sign under any one of these parity operations , i.e. , if it has the value @xmath381 for say , positively oriented triads , it should have the value @xmath382 for negatively oriented triads .",
    "its value on degenerate triads is ambiguous so on the degenerate sector we can not unambiguously recover the triads @xmath57 from the momenta @xmath380 .",
    "if one were to make @xmath63 a dynamical field @xcite , it follows that the field should be a _",
    "pseudo_-scalar under _ internal _ parity transformations ; geometrical considerations involving torsion have led to the same conclusion in @xcite .",
    "( for details , see @xcite ) .    in the diagonal bianchi i model ,",
    "we can restrict ourselves just to three parity operations @xmath96 . under their action , the canonical variables @xmath383 transform as follows : [ p1 ] _ 1 ( c_1,c_2 , c_3 ) = ( c_1 , -c_2 , -c_3 ) , _ 1 ( p_1 , p_2 , p_3 ) = ( -p_1 , p_2 , p_3 ) , and the action of @xmath384 is given by cyclic permutations . under any of these maps",
    "@xmath96 , the hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) is left invariant .",
    "this is just as one would expect because @xmath96 are simply large gauge transformations of the theory under which the physical metric @xmath49 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath66 do not change .",
    "it is clear from the action ( [ p1 ] ) that if one knows the dynamical trajectories on the octant @xmath385 of the phase space , then dynamical trajectories on any other octant can be obtained just by applying a suitable ( combination of ) @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , in the classical theory one can restrict one s attention just to the positive octant .",
    "let us now turn to the quantum theory .",
    "we now have three operators @xmath120 .",
    "their action on states is given by _ 1 ( _1,_2,_3 ) = ( -_1,_2_3 ) , etc .",
    "what is the induced action on operators ?",
    "since @xmath386 we have [ p3 ] _ 1_1_1 = -_1 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint operator is given by eqs .",
    "( [ qham2])- ( [ qham3 ] ) . to calculate its transformation property under parity maps , in addition to ( [ p3 ] )",
    ", we also need the transformation property of operators @xmath176 .",
    "an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ qham3 ] ) shows that , in view of the bianchi i symmetries , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath387 .",
    "we have : @xmath388 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\f{1}{2i}\\big[\\psi(\\l_1- \\f{\\sgn(\\l_1)}{\\l_2\\l_3},\\l_2,\\l_3)-\\psi(\\l_1+\\f{\\sgn(\\l_1)}{\\l_2\\l_3},\\l_2 , \\l_3)\\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\sin\\bar\\mu_1c_1\\psi(\\l_1,\\l_2,\\l_3 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whence _ 1 |_1c_1_1 = |_1c_1 .",
    "an identical calculation shows that @xmath389 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\f{1}{2i}\\big[\\psi(\\l_1 + \\f{\\sgn(\\l_1)}{\\l_2\\l_3},\\l_2,\\l_3)- \\psi(\\l_1-\\f{\\sgn(\\l_1)}{\\l_2\\l_3},\\l_2,\\l_3)\\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = -\\sin\\bar\\mu_1c_1\\psi(\\l_1,\\l_2,\\l_3)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath390 .",
    "therefore , we have : _ 2 |_1c_1_2 = - |_1c_1 , _ 3 |_1c_1_3 = -|_1c_1.these transformation properties of @xmath391 under @xmath120 simply mirror the transformation properties of @xmath392 under the three parity operations @xmath96 in the classical theory .",
    "( note that , because of the absolute value signs in the expressions ( [ mubar ] ) , @xmath15 do not change under any of the parity maps . )    from eqs .",
    "( [ qham2])- ( [ qham3 ] ) it now immediately follows that the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint is left invariant under @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath393 is manifestly invariant , we have : _ i _ h _ i = _ h. just as in the classical theory .",
    "because of this invariance property , given any state @xmath394 , the restriction to the positive octant of its image under @xmath213 determines its image everywhere on @xmath115 . as we saw in section [ s3.4 ] , this property simplifies the task of finding the explicit action of the hamiltonian constraint considerably .",
