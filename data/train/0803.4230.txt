    "studies of massive galaxy populations show that the most massive galaxies are in place and in possession of the majority of their stellar mass by @xmath7 @xcite . thus , while dark matter halos in a @xmath8cdm cosmology build up hierarchically with the gradual accretion and merging of smaller halos , the most massive galaxies within that context likely have more dramatic origins .",
    "the details of this process are uncertain , and ideally we would like to study sites of ongoing massive galaxy formation .",
    "nebulae or ly@xmath1  `` blobs '' ( labs )  large ( @xmath050  kpc ) clouds of gas emitting strongly in ly@xmath1  ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 )  provide such an opportunity .",
    "the large ly@xmath1  equivalent widths and the association with galaxy populations such as lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) strongly suggest that labs  are sites of ongoing galaxy formation .",
    "they have been found in small numbers ( only 16 @xmath050  kpc labs  are known ) around @xmath11  2 - 3 , a key epoch of black hole and galaxy growth ( @xcite , hereafter s00 ; @xcite ) .",
    "labs  span a range in size and surface brightness from the scales of ly@xmath1-emitting galaxies ( laes ) to the largest labs   known ( @xmath5150  kpc , @xmath527 mag arcsec@xmath12 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "labs  are similar to the large ly@xmath1  halos observed in the overdensities around higher redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but are found in radio quiet environments .",
    "the dominant power source in labs  is difficult to determine ; among the limited sample of large labs , there is evidence for embedded agn , starburst - driven superwinds , gravitational cooling radiation , and spatially - extended star formation , all of which may play a role in powering the ly@xmath1  emission ( prescott et al .",

    "most known labs , including two of the largest cases , have been discovered via narrow - band surveys , often by targeting known galaxy overdensities ( s00 ; @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up narrow - band imaging of the ssa22 region surrounding the s00 labs revealed fainter labs  associated with the same overdensity traced by the laes  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that labs  may be confined to overdense regions , as would be expected for sites of massive galaxy formation . a blank field survey by @xcite supported this claim , finding no labs  with sizes greater than @xmath530  kpc and an order of magnitude lower number density of labs  relative to that found within the ssa22 galaxy overdensity .",
    "however , the association between labs  and galaxy overdensities may be misleading , as a truely systematic wide - area search has yet to be completed .",
    "a thorough environmental study has only been done for the s00 labs , which were found by targeting a known galaxy overdensity .",
