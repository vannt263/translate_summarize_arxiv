    "the eigen model was formulated as a deterministic mutation - selection model describing replication at the onset of life @xcite .",
    "the study of mutation - selection balance in the eigen model for very high mutation rates led to the development of two new evolutionary concepts : the error threshold and the quasispecies @xcite .",
    "the first refers to the fact that , for a critical value of the mutation probability ( and for some choices of the fitness landscape , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , there is an abrupt transition in the asymptotic state of the system from a cloud of mutants organized around a given consensus sequence to an almost random distribution of genotypes .",
    "the second refers to the fact that , due to the mutational coupling , selection acts on groups of neighbour mutants ( called quasispecies ) instead of individuals .",
    "since rna viruses lack proof reading mechanisms , they have mutation rates orders of magnitude higher than dna based organisms , so that both the error threshold and the quasispecies concepts could play a relevant role for these organisms .",
    "indeed , the eigen model has became the main mathematical tool in this context ( see @xcite , @xcite for recent reviews on the subject ) .",
    "however , some authors questioned the relevance of the quasispecies as a paradigm for populations of rna viruses @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , suggesting that the high heterogeneity in populations of rna viruses could be due to genetic drift , and consequently could be better explained by population genetics models .",
    "this contrast could lead to the idea that the eigen model and population genetic models are incompatible mathematical models .",
    "for example , @xcite begins saying : `` some major differences distinguish quasispecies theory from the classical selection theories of darwin and neo - darwinian geneticists '' , while in @xcite , one can read : `` the evolutionary dynamics of rna viruses are complex and their high mutation rates , rapid replication kinetics , and large population sizes present a challenge to traditional population genetics '' .",
    "on the other hand , wilke provided evidence that this is not the case , by showing that particular limit cases of the eigen model give raise to some well known population genetics equations @xcite .",
    "however , the precise mathematical relation between the eigen model and population genetics models remains still unclear .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap , by showing that the eigen model and the haploid asexual wright - fisher model can be obtained as different particular limits of a unique discrete time stochastic model .",
    "this is done in section [ stochastic ] .",
    "motivated by the analogies between the eigen model and the wright - fisher model , in section [ thresholdsex ] we use the classical diploid mutation - selection equation and the single peak fitness landscape approximation , to determine the error threshold for sexual diploids . finally , to determine the influence of syngamy on the error threshold , in section [ thresholdasex ] we compare the results that we obtained for sexual diploids with those holding for asexual diploids",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the eigen model emerges as the deterministic and continuous time limit of a stochastic mutation - selection model . by changing the selection procedure of that model",
    ", we can obtain another stochastic model having again the eigen model as its deterministic and continuous time limit and , at the same time , the asexual wright - fisher model as a different particular subcase .",
    "let us consider a population of constant size of @xmath0 individuals of @xmath1 possible different types @xmath2 that reproduce asexually .",
    "let @xmath3 be the fecundity of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 its degradation rate and @xmath6 the probability that an individual of type @xmath7 mutates into type @xmath4 as a result of an unexact replication @xmath8 in this model selection happens at discrete time steps @xmath9 . between a selection event and the successive one , the organisms of the different types @xmath7 reproduce , mutate and degradate with their characteristic rates .",
    "we assume that only the individuals in the parental generation are subject to degradation , while the newborns will always reach the next selection step , which will restore the total population to @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the type counts just after a selection event , then , according to the above hypotheses , the expected number of individuals of type @xmath4 just before the next selection event will be given by @xmath12 all the quantities appearing in the above equation , with the exception of the @xmath13 that are integer numbers , can assume real values .",
    "indeed , equation ( [ mi ] ) should be interpreted as the deterministic limit of a stochastic process ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "notice that , since in ( [ mi ] ) the quantity @xmath14 represents the number of @xmath4 individuals in the parental generation that die before the next selection event , the time step length @xmath9 is bounded by the conditions @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "selection consists in the extraction with replacement of @xmath0 individuals from the @xmath17 population with sampling probabilities @xmath18 equal to their relative frequencies @xmath19 notice that , by definition , @xmath20 and that @xmath21 is granted by the conditions @xmath15 , so that the interpretation of the @xmath22 as probabilities is adequate .    the markov matrix of the model will be given by @xmath23 where @xmath10 and @xmath24 are the type counts in successive generations , with @xmath25 .    through ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ markov ] ) , we have defined a family of stochastic models parametrized by the time step @xmath9 .",
    "the particular case when @xmath26 corresponds to the case of separated generations , when all the individuals in the parental generation die before the next reproductive step .",
    "when ( [ separated ] ) holds , the sampling probabilities ( [ psi ] ) simplify to @xmath27 in this case , equation ( [ markov ] ) defines the asexual wright - fisher model ( see , for example , @xcite ) , with the viability of type @xmath4 given by @xmath3 .",
    "notice also that the model is now independent of the time step @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that the stochastic model defined by ( [ markov ] ) reduces to the asexual haploid wright - fisher model when the generations are separated .",
    "let us now consider the deterministic limit of the model ( [ markov ] ) .",
    "first of all , let us notice that the probability that @xmath28 is simply given by @xmath29 accordingly , the expected value of @xmath30 will be given by @xmath31 using the binomial identity @xmath32 we get @xmath33 by substituting the expression for the sampling probability ( [ psi ] ) with @xmath34 replaced by its expected value @xmath35 inside ( [ expected ] ) , we get the following system of discrete equations @xmath36 dividing equation ( [ deterministic ] ) by @xmath0 we obtain the equations for the type frequencies @xmath37 : @xmath38 for @xmath39 , we have the following asymptotic expansion @xmath40",

    ". since neither the error threshold , nor the quasispecies phenomenon are due to these differences , they are naturally present in both models ( indeed , see @xcite for the quasispecies and @xcite for the error threshold in the context of population genetics ) .    just to give a concrete example , let us compute the error threshold according to both models in a very special case that allows for a simple analytical treatment .",
    "let us suppose that each type @xmath7 is specificated by a genotype of length @xmath44 ( so that @xmath45 ) .",
    "let @xmath46 be the point mutation probability and let us send @xmath47 and @xmath48 in such a way that the genomic mutation rate @xmath49 stays finite . in this limit",
    ", the probability of mutation from the type @xmath50 to a different type @xmath51 will be given by @xmath52 and the probability of back mutation will be zero .",
    "let us also consider the single peak fitness landscape @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the single peak fitness landscape is a ( very ) simplified fitness landscape often used in the eigen model to get an analytical expression for the error threshold ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath55 be the frequency of all the sequences different from @xmath56 : @xmath57 then the eigen equations reduce to only two equations : @xmath58 , \\label{eigen1}\\\\ \\dot{\\phi}_b & = & a_1 \\left ( 1-e^{-u } \\right ) \\phi_1   + ( a_2 - d_2 ) \\phi_m-\\phi_b",

    "\\label{eigen2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the error threshold corresponds to the smallest value of the genomic mutation rate @xmath59 for which @xmath60 from equations ( [ eigen1 ] ) , ( [ eigen2 ] ) , we get the error threshold @xmath61 for the classical haploid mutation - selection model ( [ cams ] ) the above assumptions translate in considering a locus with two alleles of relative viability @xmath62 , with forward mutation given by @xmath52 and the probability of back mutation being zero . the frequencies @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the two alleles at the next generation , given that they are @xmath56 and @xmath65 at the present one will be : @xmath66 the first allele will go extinct , in the asymptotic limit , when @xmath67 for @xmath68 , that implies @xmath69 or @xmath70 this is equivalent to the eigen model result by keeping into account that the separated generations condition ( [ separated ] ) implies that @xmath71 . by rescaling @xmath72 to @xmath73 and @xmath74 to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the selection coefficient , we obtain : @xmath77",
    "given the relation between the eigen model ( [ eigeneq ] ) and the classical haploid mutation - selection model ( [ cams ] ) , it seems a natural option to use the classical diploid mutation - selection equation to determine the error threshold for sexual diploids .",
    "this was indeed done in @xcite , but the analytical derivation of the error threshold was inaccurate , giving the correct value of the critical mutation probability only for some regions of the @xmath78 space , where @xmath9 is the dominance and @xmath76 the selection parameter . to explain the problem with the derivation given in @xcite let us briefly recall it . to obtain an analytic expression for the error threshold , the authors consider a diploid analogue of the simplifying assumptions that we used in the previous section .",
    "namely , they considered a single locus with two alleles with mutation probability from the fittest to the worst allele given by @xmath79 and vanishing back mutation probability ( we recall that these simplifying assumptions comes from considering a genome of infinite length in the single peak landscape , see the previous section ) . using these assumptions ,",
    "the continuous time version of the classical diploid mutation - selection equation for the master frequency @xmath80 , reduces to ( compare with eq .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath81 where ( in their notations ) @xmath82 is the vector of frequencies , @xmath83 the viabilities matrix and @xmath84 is the mutation probability of the master sequence .",
    "next , they looked for a stationary solution of equation ( [ wiehe1 ] ) ( see eq .",
    "( 17 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath85 when solving equation ( [ wiehe2 ] ) for @xmath86 , they neglected the common @xmath80 factor ( see eq .",
    "( 18 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , they solved the equation @xmath87 for @xmath86 in the case @xmath88 .",
    "however , this procedure is incomplete for two reasons .",
    "first , it should be checked that for the obtained value of @xmath86 there are no more solutions of equation ( [ wiehe3 ] ) for @xmath89 $ ] , because in this case @xmath88 would not be a global sink for the equation ( [ wiehe1 ] ) .",
    "second , if @xmath86 is such that the left hand side of equation ( [ wiehe3 ] ) is not zero but always negative , @xmath88 will be a sink for equation ( [ wiehe1 ] ) and the corresponding value of @xmath86 a candidate for the error threshold even if equation ( [ wiehe3 ] ) is not satisfied for @xmath88 .",
    "so , in the following we will determine the error threshold by keeping into account the above considerations .    to the effect of determining the error threshold , it is equivalent to consider the time discrete or continuous , so that we will use the more traditional discrete time version of the classical diploid mutation - selection equation . as usual",
    ", we will consider two alleles on an autosomal locus in a monoecius random mating population with separated generations .",
    "let us denote by @xmath90 the fittest allele and by @xmath91 its frequency after the mutation step but before selection , while the frequency of the other allele @xmath92 will be given by @xmath93 .",
    "let the relative fitness be given by @xmath73 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 for @xmath96 and @xmath75 for @xmath97 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath98 the mutation probability from @xmath90 to @xmath92 and , using the same approximation that we considered in the haploid case , we will set the back mutation probability to zero .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict our considerations to the case when @xmath99 , that is , we will neglect underdominance and overdominance .",

    "we conclude that , for @xmath110 , the error threshold is given by equation ( [ muc1 ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath117 the equation ( [ muc1 ] ) remains valid by continuity . alternatively , since @xmath118 one can directly solve the inequality @xmath119 that implies @xmath120    when @xmath121 , @xmath122 and the discriminant can be both positive or negative",
    ". the inequality ( [ diseq2 ] ) will be satisfied if one of these three conditions is satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath123 and the largest root is less than or equal to zero , 2 .",
    "@xmath123 and the smallest root is greater than or equal to one , 3 .",
    "@xmath124 .    equation ( [ muc1 ] ) implies that one of the roots is zero , so that the first condition is satisfied if the second root ( [ secondroot ] ) is less than or equal to zero .",

    ".    the second condition can never be satisfied .",
    "indeed , a necessary condition for the smallest root of a parabola to be greater than one is that also the abscissa value of the vertex @xmath128 be greater than one . in our case this translates into the condition @xmath129 that can not be satisfied for our choice of the range of the parameters .    regarding the third condition",
    ", there exists real @xmath98 solutions to @xmath130 only when @xmath131 since it holds @xmath132 the two regions ( [ scondition1 ] ) and ( [ scondition2 ] ) cover all the region @xmath133 , @xmath134 . solving @xmath130 and imposing @xmath135",

    "since a continuous solution for the error threshold must exist in the entire region @xmath99 , @xmath133 , we conclude that the error threshold will be given by : @xmath143 the result given in @xcite coincides with the first line of equation ( [ thresex ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the result for the error threshold of sexual diploids ( [ thresex ] ) obtained in the previous section with that of asexual diploids , to evaluate the effect of syngamy on the error threshold . to this aim",
    ", we now calculate the error threshold for an asexual diploid organism , in the usual approximation of infinite genome length and single peak fitness landscape .",
    "if we have a diploid locus in an asexual organism , we denote with @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively the frequencies of the @xmath94 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 genotypes and with @xmath98 the probability of mutating from @xmath90 to @xmath92 , then under the above hypotheses , we have that after one generation : @xmath147 with @xmath148 given by @xmath149 since the equations are linear , there is no need of normalizing .",

    "notice that @xmath159 and that @xmath160 so , the error threshold will be given by @xmath161 we can now compare the error thresholds in the sexual and asexual case . comparing equations ( [ thresex ] ) , ( [ uasex ] ) and keeping into account ( [ condition ] ) and ( [ range ] ) , we see that for @xmath162 there is no difference in the error threshold between the sexual and asexual case .",
    "we plot this difference in figure [ uno ] for the whole range of variation of @xmath9 and @xmath76 .",
    "we see that , for @xmath163 , the advantageous allele is more robust to complete loss by mutation in the asexual than in the sexual case .    in figure [ due ]",
    "we show the difference between the sexual error threshold ( [ thresex ] ) and the threshold mutation rate for the loss of the advantageous homozygote in the asexual case .",
    "we see that in this case , as obvious , the advantageous homozygote is much more robust to loss by mutation in the sexual than in the asexual case .",
    "indeed , in the sexual case the advantageous homozygote can be eliminated only by completely removing the advantageous allele .",
    "we constructed a stochastic model having the haploid wright - fisher model and the eigen model as particular subcases .",
    "the haploid wright - fisher model is obtained by considering separated generations , while the eigen model is obtained by taking the deterministic and continuous time limit .",
