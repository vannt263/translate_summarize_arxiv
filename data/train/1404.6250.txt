    "<S> the results presented here represent the first constraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that high-@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) clusters are slightly ( @xmath130% ) cooler both in the inner ( @xmath7 ) and outer ( @xmath8 ) regions than their low-@xmath5 ( @xmath9 ) counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> combining the average temperature profile with measured gas density profiles from our earlier work , we infer the average pressure and entropy profiles for each subsample . confirming earlier results from this data set , we find an absence of strong cool cores at high @xmath5 , manifested in this analysis as a significantly lower observed pressure in the central @xmath10 of the high-@xmath5 cool - core subset of clusters compared to the low-@xmath5 cool - core subset . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our observed pressure profiles agree well with earlier lower - redshift measurements , suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the core . </S>",
    "<S> we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at @xmath11  this may reflect a long - standing balance between cooling and feedback over long timescales and large physical scales . we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at @xmath12 in our high-@xmath5 subsample . </S>",
    "<S> this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due to the enhanced ( @xmath13@xmath13 ) rate at which group - mass ( @xmath12kev ) halos , which would go undetected at our survey depth , are accreting onto the cluster at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this work demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially - resolved cluster properties in the case where individual cluster signal - to - noise is low , but the number of observed clusters is high . </S>"
