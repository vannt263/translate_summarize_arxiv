    "many situations in colloid , polymer and inter - facial science involve charged objects interacting in electrolyte solutions . in the case of two interacting membranes or soap films",
    "one encounters the electric double - layer .",
    "the mean - field theory of such experimental configurations is the poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite for which a surface boundary condition must be determined .",
    "for example , the surface charge or surface potential can be given , or a relation between the surface charge and surface potential may be specified .",
    "such a relationship arises in a charge regularized model where the surface charging mechanism is derived from a microscopic description of the chemistry and geometry at the interface .",
    "charge regularized models have the property that , owing to the thermodynamic nature of the charging mechanism , the surface charge changes as the distance between the two surfaces varies .",
    "the variation of the surface charge with the inter - surface distance will also change the effective interaction between the surfaces and consequently also the disjoining pressure . within the film ,",
    "the mean - field poisson - boltzmann theory is only sensitive to the electrostatic properties of the electrolyte ; the chemistry and effective sizes of the ions in the system only enter into the description of the surface charging process .",
    "for example experiments @xcite shows that the disjoining pressure increases with increasing hydration radius of the counter - ions in ionic soap films .",
    "this effect can be explained by the fact that as the counter ion radius increases the capacity for it to approach the surface and screen the surface charge is reduced .    to take into account bulk surface tensions of electrolytes",
    "one must resort to a microscopic description of the physics at the interfaces . depending on the nature of interface",
    "one may have specific adsorption due to chemical effects which can be taken into account via the law of mass action @xcite or at a more statistical mechanical level by introducing an external potential at the surface which models the chemical liaison involved @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are other forces which come into play which are not present in the standard poisson - boltzmann approach .",
    "these are effects due to fluctuations in the electromagnetic field which can be identified with van der waals forces @xcite . in bulk , the non - zero frequency van der waals forces have little effect on the static ionic distributions since the relevant frequencies are too large and their contributions can be decoupled from those of zero frequency .",
    "however , it was pointed out in @xcite that near interfaces the non - zero frequency van der waals or dispersion forces can be important and depend strongly on the polarizability of the ions involved and hence are ion specific",
    ". the zero frequency van der waals forces , which correspond to thermal fluctuations in the electrostatic field , do strongly influence ionic distributions and so do modify the surface charge .    when there are spatial variations in the dielectric constant image charges arise @xcite .",
    "in the field theoretic approach adopted in this paper image charges and their effects are naturally and systematically included by taking into account the fluctuations of the electrostatic field .    in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the field theory model we use to study the effects of non - linear terms on the surface charging mechanism whilst retaining the free field theory description for the bulk electrostatic fields .",
    "this corresponds to using linear debye theory in the bulk with fugacity @xmath4 but with the fully interacting description of the sources for the charging mechanism of the surfaces .",
    "the model is applied to a triple layer thin film as an idealized model of the surfaces where there is a stern layer of thickness @xmath0 from which all ions are excluded . in section [ mft ]",
    "we discuss the mean - field solution to the field theory for the thin film for which the non - linear interactions at the surface determine the source terms in the mean - field equation . in section [ fluct ]",
    "we give a detailed description of the effect of field fluctuations about the mean - field solution using the schrdinger kernel approach developed in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we give predictions for the surface charge @xmath1 and the disjoining pressure @xmath2 as a function of film thickness @xmath5 and show under reasonable assumptions that @xmath6 as @xmath3 and that the mean - field prediction for the large @xmath5 tail of @xmath2 is modified by one - loop corrections , both decaying like @xmath7 for large @xmath5 , where @xmath8 is the debye mass .",
    "in section [ discussion ] we present a number of example graphs and discuss their salient features .",
    "in particular , it is clear that the effects of image charges , which arise naturally and systematically in our formalism , are very strong and that qualitative predictions depend sensitively on the value of @xmath0 , the thickness of the stern layer .",
    "this demonstrates that a realistic model for the structure of the surface and the stern layer in particular is necessary for a quantitative study .",
    "we also present some conclusions in this section .",
    "we consider an idealized model of a thin film made with nonionic soap adapted to the experimental set up used to measure the disjoining pressure as a function of the film thickness @xcite . the film shown fig .",
    "( [ filmfig ] ) consists of two parallel surfaces of area @xmath9 the interior of which is filled with a monovalent electrolyte solution such as @xmath10 in water with bulk dielectric constant @xmath11 .",
    "the exterior of the film is a dielectric medium of dielectric constant @xmath12 , for example , air .",
    "the perpendicular distance between the two surfaces is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the region of thickness @xmath0 is the stern layer from which the largest ions in the system are excluded and @xmath0 can be taken to be the radius of the largest ion type in the system , which is here chosen to be the anion ( in most physical systems it is the cation with the largest radius due to hydration ) .",
    "if the radius of the cation in solution is @xmath14 and @xmath15 then the cation is excluded from a region of width @xmath14 from the surface but can be present in the region @xmath16 $ ] where there are no anions , thus leading to an effective surface charge in that region .",
    "strictly speaking , just outside the film is the surfactant layer which in general will have a different dielectric constant to that of the exterior and the aqueous interior . here for simplicity the presence of the nonionic surfactant is neglected . a version of this model with a single surface plus bulk is commonly used to model the surface properties of electrolyte solutions @xcite . in experiments",
    "the thickness @xmath5 of the film may be varied by applying an external pressure in the cell containing the film and its bulk .",
    "the grand partition function for this model system may be expressed as a functional integral    @xmath17 \\exp\\left(s[\\phi]\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 = -{1\\over 2 } \\int_{(t+l+2h)\\times a } \\beta \\epsilon({\\bf x } ) ( \\nabla \\phi)^2 d{\\bf x }   & + & 2\\mu \\int_{l\\times a } \\cos\\left ( \\beta e \\phi\\right)d{\\bf x } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\mu_+^ *   \\int_{l\\times a } ( \\delta(z ) + \\delta(l - z))\\exp\\left(i\\beta e \\phi\\right ) d{\\bf x}\\ ; , \\label{actf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the electron charge , @xmath9 is the area of the film and @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath25 $ ] the dielectric constant , which is a function only of @xmath22 , is given by @xmath26 and outside the film @xmath27 .",
    "the above field theoretical formulation can be obtained directly from quantum electrodynamics @xcite by retaining just the electrostatic potential field in the qed lagrangian and coupling it to the distribution of ion charges .",
    "alternatively , it can be obtained by standard field theory techniques based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation for a monovalent coulomb gas .",
    "the formulation takes into account both the coulomb interactions between the ions and the zero frequency van der waals forces due to fluctuations in the electrostatic potential @xcite .",
    "these zero frequency van der waals forces are particularly relevant when there are variations in the dielectric constants of the system since they naturally and systematically include the effects of image charges .",
    "this is especially the case for aqueous soap films in air where @xmath28 .",
    "the density operators for the cations and anions can be shown to be @xmath29 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ actf ] ) represents a highly localized affinity for the cations to be at the surfaces @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the film , and is responsible for the generation of a surface charge .",

    "these are the regions in the stern layers which may be occupied by the cations but from which the anions are excluded . if @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the debye length which characterizes the scale of the electrostatic interactions , then we can approximate @xmath37 by @xmath38 comparing with the formula eq .",
    "( [ actf ] ) we see that @xmath39 . in general actions of the type eq .",
    "( [ actf ] ) can be used to describe various surface charging mechanisms with the proviso that the region where the surface charge is localized has a width much smaller than the debye length , @xmath36 .",
    "whilst this description acts as a motivation for the model it is clear that in general there will in general be specific adsorption for the different species near the air water interface . to model a specific adsorption for the cations in the surface region @xmath32 $ ] we take a surface cation fugacity @xmath40 in this region which is greater than the bulk cation fugacity @xmath4 . on shrinking the surface region to zero one would then have @xmath41 .",
    "there is some evidence for specific absorption of certain ionic species at seemingly chemically neutral interfaces ; the famous and controversial jones - ray dip @xcite in the surface tension of weak electrolyte solutions ( with interfaces with air ) can be explained by invoking a specific adsorption of anions at the interface @xcite , although the basic surface exclusion model introduced in @xcite and used here can not explain negative excess surface tensions .",
    "recent experimental evidence points towards a specific adsorption of hydroxide ions at air / water and oil / water interfaces @xcite . in what follows",
    "we treat @xmath42 as an independent variable to account for the more complex charging mechanisms which can occur at the interface .",
    "it is important to note that the fugacities @xmath4 and @xmath43 are determined by the values of the physical bulk density @xmath21 and surface density for a single planar surface @xmath44 .",
    "we then have = e  ,  ^*_+ = ^*_+(ie )  , where the brackets stand for averaging over the bulk partition function . in mean - field theory",
    "this implies @xmath45 but this is not true in general and the relationship must be calculated taking field interactions into account .    in @xcite the field theory with the action of eq .",
    "( [ actf ] ) was analyzed in the weak - coupling or debye - hckel limit which is a gaussian approximation where the action is expanded to second order in the field @xmath46 .",
    "this amounts to the assumption that the mean - field densities of cations and anions throughout the film are small enough so that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the bjerrum length @xmath49 .",
    "another approach is to solve the full non - linear mean - field equations and then calculate the one loop correction which gives the effect of field fluctuations about this mean - field solution @xcite . in @xcite the resulting mean - field solution in the case of fixed surface charge",
    "was ingeniously expressed in terms of special functions which allowed an analytic calculation of the one loop correction . in our case , however , the fact that the surface charge must be computed self consistently leads to additional complications and we take a different approach .",
    "we assume that the gaussian approximation is valid inside the film but not at the surface where , because of the increased charge density , the electrostatic interactions will be stronger and we retain the full non - linear surface operators .",

    "first we determine the mean - field solution @xmath172 using the non - linear surface operators as the source and then we use the schrdinger kernel approach to calculate the partition function as an expansion in @xmath173 and @xmath174 where @xmath48 is the bjerrum length .",
    "much of the details of this approach have been discussed in an earlier paper @xcite . in this paper , we concentrate on the effects of the non - linear surface charging mechanism which leads us to introduce an effective , or running , surface charging parameter @xmath94 and we analyze the behavior of the surface charge @xmath1 and the disjoining pressure @xmath2 on @xmath175 and @xmath0 . the formulas summarizing our findings are eqs .",
    "( [ sigl ] ) and ( [ pdtot ] ) .",
    "examples of the solutions to these equations are shown in figs .",
    "( [ p_disj_h ] ) to ( [ sig_h_mf_1loop ] ) and we now briefly discuss the salient features of these results .    in figs .",
    "( [ alpha_a ] ) and ( [ alpha_m ] ) we show @xmath94 as a function of @xmath5 for various values of @xmath173 and @xmath8 , respectively . @xmath94 controls the strength of the surface charging mechanism and from eq .",
    "( [ bcnl ] ) , and what follows , it is clear that @xmath158 as @xmath3 which in turn causes @xmath131 and @xmath124 to vanish also in this limit .    in figs .",
    "( [ p_disj_h ] ) to ( [ p_disj_a ] ) we show the dependence of @xmath162 on @xmath176 , respectively . from all these figures we see that the characteristic collapse transition is evident but that its strength is very sensitive to the parameters .",
    "in particular , from fig .",
    "( [ p_disj_h ] ) we see that @xmath162 decreases as @xmath0 decreases , as we should expect since the image charges at the surface are repelling the cations and so reducing the surface charge .",
    "this effect can be seen directly in fig.([sig_h ] ) .",
    "the effect on @xmath162 is due to the @xmath124 dependent term in eq .",
    "( [ pdtot ] ) which arises because of the implicit @xmath5 dependence of the free energy through its dependence on @xmath94 .",
    "note that @xmath93 is independent of @xmath0 as in this formulation the effect of image charges first comes in at the one - loop level .",
    "the dependence of @xmath162 on @xmath8 and @xmath173 shown in figs .",
    "( [ p_disj_m ] ) and ( [ p_disj_a ] ) has the expected trends but again the height of the peak in @xmath2 is strongly dependent on the parameters which have been chosen to take values that can typically be achieved in experiment . in fig .",
    "( [ p_disj_h_mf_1loop ] ) we show the mean - field component and one - loop contributions for typical parameter values .    in figs .",
    "( [ sig_h ] ) to ( [ sig_a ] ) the behavior of the surface charge @xmath1 is shown .",
    "we see from fig ( [ sig_h ] ) that @xmath1 decreases very strongly with @xmath5 for small @xmath5 and that as @xmath0 decreases the effect strengthens and that for sufficiently small @xmath0 the value of @xmath1 has a zero and becomes negative .",
    "ultimately , @xmath6 as @xmath3 and so must have a minimum value before turning towards the origin .",
    "these effects are due to the one - loop term in eq .",
    "( [ sigl ] ) and can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "( [ sig_h_mf_1loop ] ) where the mean - field and one - loop contributions to @xmath1 are separately shown . in figs .",
    "( [ sig_m ] ) and ( [ sig_a ] ) the trends shown are as expected but , as in the case of @xmath162 the magnitude of @xmath1 is very sensitive to parameter values .",
    "the overall prediction is that @xmath1 is strongly dependent on @xmath5 and vanishes as @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "( [ p_disj_lin_nonlin ] ) we compare @xmath162 for the linearized theory from ( @xcite ) and the non - linear theory of this paper with @xmath177 .",
    "although the peak in @xmath162 occurs in much the same place it is lower in the non - linear theory for this value of @xmath0 .",
    "since the peak height is strongly dependent on @xmath0 we see that a quantitative prediction requires a realistic model for the surface .",
    "( [ sig_h ] ) .    an important feature of these calculations is to note that the results are expressed as a series in both @xmath173 or @xmath94 and @xmath174 with partial resummations in some cases . the major approximation is to use the free field theory within the bulk .",
    "the object was to study the effects of the non - linear surface charging mechanism and we have shown that these effects are indeed strong and it is clear that any approach which omits them or assumes a constant surface charge will be incorrect .",
    "some of the effects are strong and there are features , such as the minimum in @xmath1 and its change of sign , that must be studied further in the full non - linear theory to see if they are not artifacts of the approximation",
    ". a consistent control over spurious and artificial infinities must await the full perturbation theory .",
    "an example is eluded to in eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) and what follows .",
    "we have indicated how to control such quantities here to the one - loop level and see that even here the analysis is rather delicate .",
    "there are , in principle , @xmath168 terms from interactions within the bulk which will vanish as @xmath170 but contribute finite @xmath5 effects to @xmath162 and @xmath124 but these terms are not expected to be large .",
    "we shall present an analysis of all these topics in a forthcoming paper @xcite in which the full non - linear theory and its perturbation expansion will be studied ."
