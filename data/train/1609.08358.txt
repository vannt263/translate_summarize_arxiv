    "the cubic b20 compounds have a noncentrosymmetric crystal structure described by the p2@xmath63 space group .",
    "the lack of a symmetry center of the crystal structure produces the chiral spin - spin dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite . according to the model by bak and jensen @xcite and kataoka @xcite , the major ferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath7 , together with the dm interaction @xmath8 produces a ( homochiral ) structure in these systems below @xmath9 . the energy landscape in these systems",
    "is given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are balanced via the helix wave vector @xmath10 .",
    "the anisotropic exchange interaction has been added to the model , changing slightly the value and fixing the direction of the wave vector @xmath11 along the principle cubic axis . as noticed by kataoka and co - workers @xcite and maleyev and co - workers @xcite",
    ", the cubic anisotropy can play an important role in the case of relative small values of the helix wave vector @xmath12 .",
    "if the anisotropic energy getting comparable to the dm interaction , it can destabilize the entire helix structure and stabilizes instead the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath13 is needed to rotate the helix wave vector @xmath11 towards the field direction and , therefore , it is a measure for the anisotropy of the system . according to @xcite ,",
    "the energy difference between the conical and the collinear full - polarized ( fp ) state can be directly measured by the second critical field @xmath14 .",
    "this energy is equal to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the spin - wave stiffness , @xmath17 is the ordered spin , and @xmath18 is the lattice constant .",
    "the experimental parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath17 describe completely the magnetic system of such compounds .",
    "the compound fege shows a significant difference in the parameters of the magnetic structure compared to the other b20 helimagnet mnsi@xcite .",
    "the helix length is nearly four times higher and equal to @xmath19   , and the ordering temperature @xmath0  278.7  k is nearly ten times higher than the @xmath5 for mnsi .",
    "as to the anisotropic interactions the helix wave vector is pinned along the @xmath20 $ ] direction in mnsi at all temperatures below @xmath0  29.5  k , whereas the helix wave vector in fege is pinned along the @xmath21 $ ] direction in the high - temperature range between @xmath5  =  278.7  k and @xmath22=211  k/@xmath23=245  k and rotates towards the @xmath20 $ ] direction in the low - temperature part of the ordered phase for @xmath24 . according to the bak and jensen model",
    "a temperature driven rotation of the spiral from the @xmath21 $ ] to the @xmath20 $ ] goes along with a change of the sign of the second order gradient in the free energy expansion .",
    "nevertheless , magnetization measurements indicated that the rotation of the helix axis at @xmath25 can be explained by an interplay of constants of 4th and 6th terms of the cubic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "while the spin - wave dynamic of mnsi has been intensively studied in the past @xcite , it was never the case for fege , due to the lack of a sufficient large amount of single crystalline samples , which is necessary for the triple axis spectroscopy ( tas ) .",
    "the recently proposed method @xcite to determine the spin - wave stiffness in the helical magnets based on dm interaction in the fp state , using polarized small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) , can be extended to be used for the polycrystalline fege compounds .",
    "this method was originally developed and applied to measure the spin - wave stiffness in ferromagnetic compounds @xcite .",
    "the presence of the dm chiral interaction leads to the chirality of the spin - waves in fp state of helimagnets .",
    "this fact is related to the completely anisotropic dispersion relation of magnons , which reads @xmath26 for the magnetic field above the critical value @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it can be analytically shown that the inelastic scattering of the neutrons in this case is concentrated mostly around the momentum transfers corresponding to @xmath27 within two narrow cones limited by the cut - off angle @xmath28 for the energy gain / energy loss , respectively @xcite .",
    "the cut - off angle is connected to the spin - wave stiffness via the dimensionless parameter @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the neutron mass , @xmath32 is the bragg angle of the scattering on the spin spiral with the length @xmath33 , and @xmath34 denotes the energy of the incident neutrons .",
    "here we assume conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be fulfilled in the limit of small - angle neutron scattering .",
    "the first condition allows one to split momentum transfer into elastic component perpendicular to @xmath37 and inelastic one parallel to @xmath37 .",
    "bose factor @xmath38^{-1}$ ] can be replaced by @xmath39 accounting for the second condition . despite of being @xmath40-odd ,",
    "the cross section of the inelastic scattering being integrated over the energy transfer contains the polarization - dependent part due to the peculiarity of the aforementioned asymmetric dispersion relation . as was demonstrated in @xcite",
    ", one can distinguish the scattering from the helimagnons in a homochiral crystalline sample using polarized neutrons in sans experiment .    in this paper",
    "we show the possibility to measure the sw stiffness in the polycrystalline samples using non - polarized neutrons .",
    "as the sample contains both left and right crystallites , it is , therefore , not possible to demonstrate the chiral nature of the spin - wave scattering .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to detect two circles on a scattering map with radius @xmath28 and centered at the bragg peak @xmath32 .",
    "the spin - wave stiffness @xmath1 is measured in the temperature range below @xmath5 by finding the cut - off angle in accordance to eq.[eq:1 ] .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : sections [ sec : ii ] and [ sec : iii ] give the results of the small - angle neutron scattering measurements of the fege compound .",
    "section [ sec : iv ] presents the conclusions .",
    "the sans experiment was performed at the d11 instrument at the ill ( grenoble , france ) .",
    "an unpolarized beam with a mean wavelength of @xmath41  nm was used .",
    "a magnetic field ( 0.0 - 0.5  t ) was applied perpendicular to the incident beam .",
    "the fege sample with the mass of 0.1 g was the same as used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "it was synthesized using the high pressure method ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "typical sans map for @xmath42  250  k and @xmath43  0.075  t is shown in fig.[ris : fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "several bragg peaks appear on the left and right sides of the scattering map , where the center of the map corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "the two peaks closest to the center are from the helical structure at @xmath45 nm@xmath46 .",
    "the others are clearly the higher orders of multiple scattering .",
    "the spiral wave vector is aligned to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "fig.[ris : fig1 ] ( b ) represents the integrated intensities of the bragg peak @xmath47 at @xmath45 nm@xmath46 as function of the field for different temperatures between 5 k and @xmath0  278.7  k. the sample has been cooled down from @xmath5 . the cooling has been stopped at 16 different temperatures in - between and a field scan with increasing magnetic field was performed at each temperature . as it is shown in the insert",
    ", the first critical field @xmath13 is defined as a point of the maximal intensity , this is the point where all spirals are aligned along the field .",
    "the difference to the previously used method @xcite for fe@xmath48co@xmath49ge is worth mentioning , where we determined @xmath13 as the starting point for the increasing intensity , corresponding to the spirals starts aligning along the field direction .",
    "the second critical field @xmath14 is determined from the zero point of the fitting function according to the bak - jensen model .",
    "the model predicts that the cone angle @xmath50 , counted from the helix plane , increases with the field as @xcite : @xmath51 thus , the intensity of elastic scattering subsides @xmath52 .",
    "however , a tail of the intensity can be still observed above @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ ris : fig1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this tail is better pronounced at the low temperatures , while it becomes invisible in the high - temperature region .",
    "the phenomenon may be caused by influence of the cubic anisotropy that makes the critical field @xmath14 depending on orientation of the applied field with respect to the principal crystallographic axes @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure in the randomly oriented crystallites undergo the phase transition to the field polarized state at different strength of the field from the minimal @xmath53 to maximal value @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the constant of the cubic anisotropy .",
    "the helix wave vector @xmath56 has been determined as a center of the gaussian function fitting the helical bragg peak in zero magnetic field for each temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the helix wave vector is shown in fig.[ris : fig1 ] ( b ) , it is nearly constant and equal to 0.09  nm@xmath46 in the whole temperature range .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath57 phase diagram for fege between 5  k and @xmath5 is shown in fig.[ris : fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the second critical field @xmath14 decreases slowly from a maximum value of 0.3  t at low temperature and tends to zero at @xmath5 .",
    "the first critical field @xmath13 stays roughly constant at 0.1  t between 5  k and 180  k and decreases with further temperature increase towards zero at @xmath5 .",
    "as it was mentioned , the @xmath14 is the measure of the difference in energies of the spiral state and the fp state and is equal to @xmath58 . as far as @xmath12 shows no change , temperature decrease of @xmath14 is expected to be driven by decrease of @xmath1 and is related to the softening of the magnetic structure with the temperature . meanwhile the mechanism standing behind the temperature changing of the @xmath13 remains less clear .",
    "the insert of figure [ ris : fig2 ] shows a typical sans map for fege , which is taken above @xmath14 .",
    "as the field reaches @xmath14 the elastic scattering disappears and only the inelastic scattering centered at @xmath59 remains .",
    "this scattering consists of the strong diffuse scattering in the vicinity of the former bragg peak and a round spot limited by the critical angle @xmath28 .",
    "the diffuse scattering at @xmath59 is maximal at @xmath60 and strongly suppressed by increase of the field . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) the spin - wave part of the scattering becomes narrower with further increase of the field and has vanished at a certain @xmath61 above @xmath14 . using eq.[eq:0 ]",
    ", we define this value as @xmath62 and obtain @xmath63 . to define the cut - off angle @xmath28 ,",
    "a measurement of the background intensity at @xmath64 was subtracted from the other scattering maps . to improve the statistics , the scattering intensity was azimuthally - averaged over the angular sector of 120 degrees with the center positioned at @xmath59 , as shown in fig.[ris : fig2 ] .",
    "the resultant curve is shown in fig.[ris : fig2 ] for @xmath65 k and @xmath66 t. from the analysis of the @xmath47 versus @xmath67 plot the cut - off angle can be extracted .    nevertheless , a sharp cut - off of the intensity was not observed due to the dumping of spin - waves .",
    "the expected step - like intensity profile is smeared into the smoothly decreasing curve .",
    "this smeared step - like edge of the measured intensity was fitted by the following sigmoid function , which captures the main features of the scattering : @xmath68\\right)\\right\\}\\ ] ] the position of the cut - off angle was determined as the center of the arctan function @xmath28 .",
    "its width @xmath69 is related to the spin - wave damping @xmath70 .",
    "fig.[ris : fig3 ] shows the intensities as function of the angle @xmath67 at different values of the magnetic field for @xmath71  =  250  k together with the corresponding fitting curves .",
    "the curves show a decrease of the value of the cut - off angle together with a strong suppression of the scattering @xmath72 with increase of the field . the latter is related to the gap in the spin - wave spectrum increasing with the field , when the quasi elastic scattering with relatively low @xmath40 is forbidden .",
    "consequently , the intensity being proportional to @xmath73 decreases at low @xmath74 .    the intensity for @xmath75  =  0.35  t is plotted in fig.[ris : fig4 ] ( a ) for different temperatures between 196  k and 270  k including fitting functions .",
    "two parameters @xmath76 and @xmath69 have been extracted from the fitting procedure .",
    "fig.[ris : fig4 ] ( c ) shows the field dependence of the dumping related parameter @xmath69 for different temperatures between 246  k and 277  k , which is nearly constant for each temperature .",
    "fig.[ris : fig4 ] ( b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath69 , @xmath69 increases drastically close to @xmath5 in accordance with theoretical expectations .",
    "the linear field dependence of the squared cut - off angle @xmath77 against the magnetic field is shown in fig.[ris : fig5 ] for @xmath71  = 246 , 265 and 274  k. we were not able to determine the cut - off angle for the temperatures below 225  k because of the intensive quasi - elastic scattering arising in the position of the former bragg peak position .",
    "the square of the cut - off angle depends linearly on the field in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) one can determine the value of the parameter @xmath78 and determine the spin - wave stiffness with high accuracy .",
    "the spin - wave stiffness , obtained from the cut - off angle for different temperatures is shown in fig.[ris : fig6 ] .",
    "the measured temperature dependence was fitted by the power law : @xmath79 , parameters are found to be @xmath80 ev@xmath3 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the value of the stiffness @xmath1 does not tend to 0 as one would expect at @xmath5 , for the second order phase transitions , but is finite @xmath83  ev@xmath3 .",
    "this fact clearly classifies the magnetic phase transition in fege as being of the first order .",
    "the spin - wave stiffness can also be estimated from the theory by bak and jensen @xcite using the ratio relating the critical magnetic field @xmath14 and the difference in the energies between the fp and helical states @xmath84 .",
    "the relation has been experimentally confirmed to be valid for mnsi in the whole temperature range below @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the stiffness calculated in this model is also shown in fig.[ris : fig6 ] .",
    "the trend of the stiffness is the same including its decrease with temperature for the calculated and measured values .",
    "however , the magnitudes strongly deviate one from another .",
    "as the matter of fact , the probed excitations show two times lower value than it was predicted from the value of the @xmath14 .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated value of @xmath1 may be caused by the demagnetization effect within our polycrystalline samples , which has not been taken into account in determination of the critical field @xmath14 .",
    "due to the higher magnetic moment and the polycrystalline nature of the used fege samples , this effect might play a bigger role for fege than for the previous investigated single crystalline mnsi @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have experimentally determined the spin - wave dynamic in the high temperature phase of the fege compound .",
    "we confirm the validity of the spin - wave dispersion relation for another helimagnet with dm interaction ( eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "furthermore we demonstrated the ability of small - angle neutron scattering to measure the spin - wave dynamic in polycrystalline samples of dm helimagnets in the full - polarized state with acceptable statistics in reasonable time .",
    "the method allows the determination of the spin - wave dynamic in a broad temperature range and above all opens up complete new possibilities in the investigation of the parameter of the spin - wave dynamics in other representatives of dm helimagnets , which could be synthesized as powder only .",
