    "relativistic binary pulsars have been celebrated as being unique laboratories for high - precision tests of general relativity and accurate determinations of neutron star masses ( @xcite ) . to date , post - keplerian general relativistic parameters have been measured for nine binary pulsar systems ( see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "five are double neutron star binaries ( psrs b1913 + 16 , b1534 + 12 , b2127 + 11c , j1518 + 4904 , j1811@xmath01736 ) and four ( psrs j1713 + 0747 , b1802@xmath007 , b1855 + 09 , b2303 + 46 ) have white dwarf companions . through radio timing observations of psr  b1913 + 16 , general relativity has been confirmed at the @xmath80.3% level ( @xcite ) .",
    "timing observations of these pulsars show that the neutron star masses fall in a narrow range centered on 1.35  m@xmath5  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of variation of these masses is surprising given the variety of binary evolution mechanisms by which they were formed .",
    "of the above relativistic binary systems , all but one are likely to share a similar evolutionary history .",
    "the observed pulsar in most of these systems has a large characteristic age @xmath9 and low surface magnetic field @xmath10 relative to the bulk of the isolated pulsar population .",
    "this is because the observed neutron star , the first - born in the binary , was `` recycled '' by a phase of mass transfer from its companion as the latter ascended the giant branch ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 for details of neutron - star binary evolution ) .",
    "this results in spin up of the neutron star and the reduction of its magnetic field .",
    "the binary observed today has survived the supernova explosion of the secondary ( although in the cases of psrs b2127 + 11c and b1802@xmath007 , which are in globular clusters , the possibility of a more complicated evolutionary history can not be discounted ) .",
    "the exception among the above binaries is psr  b2303 + 46 which shows no evidence for having been recycled , having @xmath10 and @xmath9 comparable to the bulk of the isolated pulsar population .",
    "psr  b2303 + 46 , long thought to be part of a double neutron - star binary , has recently been shown to have a white - dwarf companion ( @xcite ) which must have formed _ prior _ to the pulsar s birth .",
    "formation mechanisms for such a system have been suggested by portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1999 ) and tauris & sennels ( 2000 ) and involve an initial primary , the white dwarf progenitor , which transferred sufficient matter onto the initial secondary that the latter underwent core collapse .",
    "we report here on psr  j1141@xmath06545 , a relativistic binary pulsar recently discovered as part of the parkes multibeam pulsar survey .",
    "a preliminary report on this system was presented by manchester et al .",
    "the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( @xcite ) , currently underway at the 64-m radio telescope in parkes , australia , makes use of a multibeam receiver which operates at a wavelength of 20  cm and permits simultaneous observations of 13 separate regions of the sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "the survey , roughly halfway complete , has been extremely successful , having discovered over 500 new radio pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observing system used has been described by lyne et al .",
    "observations are centered on 1374  mhz , with 288  mhz of bandwidth in each of two orthogonal polarizations , for each of the 13 beams .",
    "the filtered and amplified signals are fed into a @xmath11  mhz filterbank system , then are square - law detected .",
    "the polarization pairs are summed , and the results are 1-bit digitized every 250  @xmath12s and recorded on tape .",
    "observations are of 35-min duration .",
    "offline , the data are dedispersed at many trial dispersion measures ( dms ) and subjected to @xmath13-point fast fourier transforms .    psr  j1141@xmath06545  was discovered in our standard analysis .",
    "a periodicity at 394  ms and at dm of 118  pc  @xmath14 was reported as having signal - to - noise ratio 15.4 in data obtained on 1999 april 28 .",
    "immediately apparent in the discovery observation was the variation in the pulse period due to binary acceleration . had the pulsar been isolated , its signal - to - noise ratio would have been 40 .",
    "confirmation observations were made at parkes on 1999 july 10 .",
    "a series of observations in the following week determined the binary parameters .",
    "regular timing observations of psr  j1141@xmath06545  were carried out at numerous epochs from 1999 july 10 through 2000 january 19 using the central beam of the multibeam receiver . in the timing observations , the same data acquisition and online software system",
    "are used as in the regular survey observations . at 1374  mhz",
    ", we obtained 123 pulse arrival times at 3-mhz frequency resolution , and 31 pulse arrival times using a higher resolution @xmath15-mhz filterbank .",
    "two observations were made at 600  mhz , on 1999 august 23 and 24 , using a @xmath16-mhz filterbank and the standard data acquisition system .",
    "timing observations were divided into 1-min sub - integrations which were partially de - dispersed into 8 sub - bands and folded at the predicted topocentric pulsar period using 1024 pulse phase bins .",
    "typical total integration times were @xmath810  min .",
    "final dedispersion of the sub - bands and folding of the sub - integrations were done in a subsequent processing step .",
    "each pulse profile was then cross - correlated with a high signal - to - noise template appropriate for the observing frequency and filterbank resolution .",
    "the template for the high - resolution 20-cm observations is shown in figure  [ fig : grand ] .",
    "the other templates appear similar , including that at 600  mhz .",
    "the pulse times - of - arrival ( toas ) which result from the cross - correlation were then subject to a timing analysis using the tempo software package which converts them to barycentric toas at infinite frequency using the jet propulsion laboratory de200 solar - system ephemeris ( @xcite ) and performs a multi - parameter least - squares fit for the pulsar spin and binary parameters . during the fitting ,",
    "the pulsar s position was held fixed at the value determined by interferometric observations ( see  [ sec : atca ] ) .",
    "also , the dm was determined using the two 600-mhz observations and six 1400-mhz observations obtained on 1999 august 22 and 23 , and was held fixed for the rest of the timing analysis .",
    "the results of the timing analysis are presented in table  [ ta : parms ] .",
    "the fit parameters were @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the five keplerian orbital parameters , and a rate of periastron advance , @xmath19 .",
    "upper limits on other post - keplerian parameters were determined individually .",
    "post - fit timing residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : res ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the arrival times were determined empirically by demanding that the reduced @xmath20 for observations over a short span ( 12 days ) be unity .",
    "the formal reduced @xmath20 for these residuals is 4.7 ( 145 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this clearly indicates that there are unmodeled effects in the data . that the residuals as a function of orbital phase do not display systematic trends",
    "leads us to believe the orbital parameters are not biased by these effects . indeed",
    "the two arrival times with the largest residuals , near epoch 1999.96 , are at orbital phases separated by @xmath80.5 .",
    "the unmodeled features may be manifestations of standard `` timing noise , '' a stochastic process seen in many young pulsars like psr  j1141@xmath06545  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this may bias the measured spin parameters slightly .",
    "psr  j1141@xmath06545  was observed on 1999 august 22 and 23 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) which is located in narrabri , australia .",
    "the array was in its `` 6d '' configuration , which has maximum baseline 5878  m. the observations were done in pulsar gating mode at center frequencies of 1384 and 2496  mhz simultaneously , with 128  mhz of bandwidth in each of two linear polarizations for each frequency .",
    "the primary and secondary calibrators for the observations were the bright radio point sources 1934@xmath0638 and 1329@xmath0665 .",
    "the data were processed using the miriad processing package . after standard",
    "interference flagging and calibration were done , on- and off - pulse images were formed .",
    "the off - pulse emission was then subtracted from the uv data set leaving only on - pulse emission from the pulsar .",
    "a point source was then fitted to these uv data using the nominal position and a rough estimate of the flux density of the pulsar . a model of the resulting uv data",
    "was then fitted using trial positions and flux densities for the pulsar using the miriad uvfit task .",
    "best - fit values and uncertainties were obtained for both the 1384- and 2496-mhz data sets .",
    "since the pulsar is brighter at 1384  mhz , we use the more accurate fitted position from that data set in the timing analysis ( see table  [ ta : parms ] ) .",
    "the 1384-mhz pulsed flux ( @xmath83.3  mjy ) is consistent with that estimated from the parkes observations ; the @xmath21 upper limit on point - like radio emission off - pulse is 0.66 mjy at this frequency .",
    "we have measured the polarization properties of psr  j1141@xmath06545 , which are especially interesting given the possibility of significant precession of the pulsar ( see  [ sec : relobs ] below ) .",
    "observations were made on 2000 march 26 ( mjd 51629 ) using the center beam of the multibeam receiver and the caltech correlator ( navarro 1994 ) .",
    "instrumental phases and gains were calibrated using a pulsed noise signal injected at @xmath22 to the two signal probes ( see navarro et al .",
    "1997 for a full description ) .",
    "two 25-min observations using 64-mhz bandwidth at orthogonal feed angles were summed to produce the polarization profiles shown in figure  [ fig : poln ] .",
    "position angles were corrected for faraday rotation in the earth s ionosphere . the ionospheric contribution to the rotation measure ( rm )",
    "was estimated to be @xmath23 rad m@xmath24 at the time of the observation using an ionospheric model , so the plotted angles are approximately @xmath25 greater than those observed .",
    "the precision of the absolute position angles is limited by the uncertainty in this correction , which we estimate to be @xmath26 .    on average ,",
    "the pulse profile is 16% linearly polarized ( see figure  [ fig : poln ] ) .",
    "the position angle shows a complicated variation across the pulse with a clear orthogonal transition in the leading wing and a sharp drop toward the trailing edge of the pulse .",
    "the circular polarization is relatively strong , with a mean value of @xmath27% .",
    "there is a possible reversal in the sign of @xmath28 at a pulse phase slightly preceding the orthogonal transition in the linear polarization .",
    "these properties are not consistent with any simple model for the polarization .",
    "the shape of the total intensity profile suggests that the main peak is near the trailing edge of a conal beam .",
    "this may be supported by the location of the reversal of sign of @xmath28 which is usually ( but not always ) located near the center of the beam ( han et al .",
    "however , the observed position angle variation is certainly not consistent with a rotating vector model having a beam center on the leading wing .",
    "the interstellar component of the rm , estimated by computing the weighted mean position angle difference between the two halves of the observed band , is @xmath29 rad m@xmath24 .",
    "this implies a mean line - of - sight interstellar field , weighted by the electron density along the path , of 0.9 @xmath12 g directed away from us .",
    "rms of neighboring pulsars are of mixed sign and magnitude ( han , manchester and qiao 1999 ) . at the estimated distance of 3.2 kpc , as inferred from the dm and a model for the galactic electron distribution ( @xcite ) , the path to the pulsar crosses the carina arm ; the structure of the galactic magnetic field in this region is evidently complex .",
    "psr  j1141@xmath06545  is different from most of the other known relativistic binary pulsars in several important respects .",
    "the pulsar s characteristic age , @xmath30  yr , and inferred surface magnetic field strength , @xmath3  g , are similar to those of the bulk of the isolated pulsar population .",
    "thus , psr  j1141@xmath06545  is unlikely to have ever been recycled . like the other short-@xmath31 , eccentric relativistic binaries",
    ", it may be a double neutron star binary , but if so , we must be observing the second - formed neutron star in its short - lived radio pulsar phase . in this case , its companion could still be an observable radio pulsar that was not detected in our parkes observations , either because its short spin period varies too rapidly due to the binary orbit ( a possibility we are checking , given our knowledge of the binary orbit ) or because its radio beam does not intersect our line of sight .",
    "however , we show here that the companion is unlikely to be a second neutron star , given the system s mass function , its rate of precession @xmath19 , and what is known about the neutron star mass distribution .",
    "the mass function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the pulsar and companion masses , respectively , @xmath31 is the orbital period , and @xmath35 is the projected semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit .",
    "this provides a constraint on the minimum @xmath34 for any assumed @xmath33 , by setting @xmath36 , the inclination of the orbital angular momentum with respect to the line - of - sight , to @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 , under the assumption that it is due to general relativistic periastron precession ( but see  [ sec : classom ] ) , is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39  s.",
    "this then determines the total system mass @xmath40 . for @xmath41yr@xmath42 ( table  [ ta : parms ] ) , @xmath43  m@xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows these constraints in @xmath44 phase space .",
    "the shaded region is ruled out by the mass function .",
    "the intersection of the @xmath19 straight line with the boundary of this region determines the maximum allowed pulsar mass : @xmath45  m@xmath5  ( @xmath46 ) or @xmath47  m@xmath5  ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "similarly , we set a lower limit @xmath48  m@xmath5  ( @xmath46 ) or @xmath49  m@xmath5  ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) showed that measurements of neutron star masses are consistent with all being drawn from a gaussian distribution having mean and standard deviation 1.35 and 0.04  m@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the parameters in the psr  j1141@xmath06545  system are thus interesting : if @xmath33 is close to its maximum allowed value corresponding to @xmath50 , as would be consistent with other neutron star masses , then its companion has mass much lower than those of all known neutron stars , and therefore is unlikely to be one . of course on _ a posteriori _ statistical grounds , @xmath51 is improbable . on the other hand , a smaller @xmath36 implies a less massive pulsar . for the median value @xmath52 , @xmath53  m@xmath5 , and @xmath54  m@xmath5 , both significantly lower than for any other known neutron stars .",
    "note that none of these values can be ruled out based on neutron star stability arguments , since masses of as little as @xmath80.1  m@xmath5  are allowed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however the formation mechanism for such low - mass neutron stars is unclear .",
    "a more likely possibility is that the psr  j1141@xmath06545  system is a neutron star / co white - dwarf binary seen edge - on .",
    "( onemg white dwarfs have minimum mass @xmath81.1  m@xmath5[wanajo , hashimoto & nomoto 1999 ] so this possibility can not be ruled out . )",
    "the evolutionary history of the psr  j1141@xmath06545  binary , if the companion is a massive white dwarf , is then clear ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : the system originated as a binary consisting of two main sequence stars having mass ratio near unity , but with neither sufficiently massive to independently form a neutron star . for example , the primary may have had mass 7  m@xmath5  and the secondary 5  m@xmath5 .",
    "the primary evolved first to form the white dwarf , in the process transferring sufficient matter onto the secondary for its mass to exceed that necessary to form a neutron star .",
    "after the white dwarf formed , it spiraled into the envelope of the now more massive secondary as the latter ascended the giant branch , greatly decreasing the orbital period , and ejecting the common envelope .",
    "the secondary , a helium star after the ejection of the envelope , then exploded in a supernova , which fortuitously did not disrupt the binary .",
    "the radio pulsar we see is therefore the second evolved star .",
    "the evolutionary scenario in which a massive white dwarf forms prior to the neutron star has been considered in population synthesis studies .",
    "dewey & cordes ( 1987 ) and portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1999 ) showed that the birth rate of white dwarf / young pulsar binaries is comparable to that of double neutron star binaries .",
    "however , portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1999 ) argued that the white dwarf should have mass @xmath55  m@xmath5 , a result of their assumption that a neutron - star forming binary had to have an initial primary mass of @xmath56  m@xmath5 . to form a @xmath81  m@xmath5  white dwarf ,",
    "an initial minimum primary mass of @xmath86  m@xmath5  is required ( s. portegies zwart , private communication ) .",
    "the work of tauris & sennels ( 2000 ) confirms that white dwarf / young neutron star systems should be observable , but they suggest that the birth rate of such systems is much higher than that of double neutron star systems . a lower allowed initial primary mass for forming white dwarfs in the portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1999 ) analysis could reduce the disagreement .",
    "one prediction of the binary evolution theory is that the space velocity of psr  j1141@xmath06545  will be greater than @xmath8150  km  s@xmath42 ( @xcite ) . at a distance of 3.2  kpc , this implies a proper motion of @xmath57  mas  yr@xmath42 , which could be measurable by timing on a time scale of a few years .",
    "vlbi observations may also be able to detect it .",
    "in fact , given the pulsar s timing age , galactic latitude , distance estimate , and assuming that the pulsar was born in the galactic plane , the component of the pulsar s space velocity perpendicular to the plane must be @xmath58  km  s@xmath42 , already roughly consistent with the prediction .",
    "if the companion is indeed a white dwarf , allowing for interstellar reddening , its b magnitude is likely to be in the range 25  26.5 and r in the range 24.5  26 . from a digital sky survey image of the field ,",
    "it is clear that the field is relatively crowded , but not impossibly so .",
    "excellent seeing conditions on the vlt would allow detection of the companion . if detected , then a follow - up temperature measurement using hst may provide a useful age constraint",
    ".      the observed @xmath19 may not be purely relativistic , in which case the above conclusions would have to be modified .",
    "classical contributions to @xmath19 can come either from tidal deformation of the companion by the neutron star ( significant only if the companion is non - degenerate ) , or from a rotation - induced quadrupole moment in the companion , possibly relevant if it is a rapidly rotating white dwarf .",
    "we consider these possibilities in turn .",
    "a tide raised on the companion star gives it a quadrupole moment that results in a classical apsidal advance , @xmath59 , given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the companion radius and @xmath62 its apsidal constant , a measure of its internal density distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "a hydrogen main sequence star companion could in principle fit in the orbit , but would result in a classical @xmath19 @xmath81000 times the relativistic value ( see @xcite ) so is certainly ruled out",
    ". however , a helium main sequence star has much smaller radius , and would result in a classical @xmath19 that is comparable to the expected relativistic value .",
    "we have explored this possibility by considering a range of values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and finding the expected @xmath63 that match the observed value . for these calculations",
    ", we assumed @xmath64 , as derived by roberts et al .",
    "( 1976 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] , the dashed line shows the allowed locus in @xmath44 space for a non- or slowly rotating helium star companion .",
    "clearly this is possible only if @xmath65  m@xmath5 .",
    "this seems unlikely given observed masses of other neutron stars .",
    "a rapidly rotating white dwarf would have a quadrupole moment that could result in a significant classical @xmath19 ( roberts et al .",
    "1976 , @xcite ) .",
    "however unlike the tidal quadrupole , the rotationally - induced quadrupole lies in a plane perpendicular to the white dwarf spin axis . since the pulsar formed after the white dwarf",
    ", it is unlikely that the white dwarf spin axis is aligned with the orbital angular momentum , as this would demand a fortuitously symmetric supernova explosion .",
    "a misalignment of the angular momenta results in classical spin - orbit coupling , that is , a precession of the orbital plane , @xmath66 as in the pulsar / b - star binary psr  j0045@xmath07319 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this precession would manifest itself as a time - variable projected semi - major axis @xmath67 .",
    "in general , the magnitude of @xmath66 is comparable to that of the periastron precession @xmath19 ( @xcite ) . for psr  j1141@xmath06545",
    ", we find an upper limit on @xmath68 that is much smaller than @xmath19 ( table  [ ta : parms ] ) .",
    "this might suggest that spin - orbit coupling is unlikely to be occurring .",
    "however , @xmath68 varies as @xmath69 ; since @xmath50 ( especially if @xmath70 is smaller than our observed value ) , we can not rule out orbital plane precession , i.e. a large @xmath66 .",
    "the above reasoning also holds for a helium - star companion that is rotating rapidly . in this case , the dashed line in figure  [ fig : mass ] is inappropriate as it assumes no contribution from a rotation - induced quadrupole moment .",
    "hence , we can not presently rule out this possibility",
    ". however , a 1-m@xmath5  helium main sequence star would be considerably brighter than a white dwarf : assuming it is on the helium main sequence , it would have bolometric luminosity @xmath71 and @xmath72  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "using bolometric corrections from bessell , castelli & plez ( 1998 ) and given the distance and expected reddening , a helium star should have @xmath73 , and should be easily distinguishable from a white dwarf .",
    "the prospects for a high - precision determination of both component masses in the psr  j1141@xmath06545  binary system are excellent .",
    "our upper limit on the combined time dilation and gravitational redshift parameter @xmath74 is shown in table  [ ta : parms ] .",
    "note that this is largely independent of which model for the system is correct .",
    "given that the fractional uncertainty in @xmath74 scales as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the observing span ( @xcite ) , we expect a 3@xmath77 detection by 2001 , assuming @xmath19 is purely relativistic ( for which @xmath78  ms for @xmath79  m@xmath5 )",
    ". furthermore , a general relativistic orbital period derivative , @xmath80 , should be measurable with interesting precision by 2004 , given that its fractional uncertainty scales as @xmath81 and its expected value is @xmath82 .",
    "thus , continued high - precision timing observations of psr  j1141@xmath06545  will eventually test our assumptions about a purely relativistic @xmath19 .",
    "although the orbit is likely to be highly inclined , measurement of shapiro delay will be difficult : the maximum expected delay is only @xmath85  @xmath12s , well below our current timing precision .",
    "although psr  j1141@xmath06545  will coalesce in @xmath81.5  gyr due to gravitational - radiation - induced orbit decay , it , and coalescing neutron - star / white - dwarf binaries in general , will not be detected by ligo .",
    "the detectability depends on the frequency of the emitted radiation near the time of coalescence .",
    "this depends on the size of the orbit at coalescence , which , to order of magnitude , is the white dwarf radius , @xmath83  cm .",
    "this implies an orbital frequency of @xmath80.25  hz at coalescence ; the implied gravitational wave frequency , twice the orbital frequency , is well outside the ligo band of 1010,000  hz . however , such signals would be within the 0.000011  hz band of the proposed laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ; @xcite ) .",
    "general relativistic geodetic precession ( @xcite ) is predicted to result in the precession of the pulsar s spin axis at a rate of @xmath84yr@xmath42 ( assuming a purely relativistic @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is greater than that predicted for the two pulsars for which it has been observed , psr  b1913 + 16 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and psr  b1534 + 12 ( @xcite ) , although the measured amplitude will be suppressed by a possibly large factor that depends on the unknown line - of - sight geometry and spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "given the narrow pulse profile seen in psr  j1141@xmath06545  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grand ] , fwhm of 0.011@xmath17 ) , this effect could be detected in a few years , barring unfortunate geometries .",
    "thus far , we have detected no strong evidence for pulse profile changes , although a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .    that the pulsar was not detected in past pulsar radio surveys of the region",
    "is intriguing .",
    "the johnston et al .",
    "( 1992 ) 20-cm survey of the galactic plane had minimum detectable flux density of @xmath81  mjy , below the pulsar s 20-cm flux density of 3.3  mjy . at this frequency",
    ", the pulsar displays no evidence for scintillation .",
    "the parkes all - sky survey at 70  cm may also have been able to detect it .",
    "that survey s sensitivity reached 20  mjy for galactic plane sources ; extrapolating the flux densities in table  [ ta : parms ] , the estimated flux density at 70  cm is @xmath840  mjy .",
    "scattering for the pulsar at that frequency is negligible .",
    "thus , it is plausible that the pulsar s beam has only recently precessed into our line - of - sight , a result of geodetic precession .",
    "if so , the pulse profile should be evolving rapidly .",

    "<S> the pulsar shows no evidence for being recycled , having pulse period @xmath1  ms , characteristic age @xmath2  yr , and inferred surface magnetic dipole field strength @xmath3  g. from the mass function and measured rate of periastron advance , we determine the total mass in the system to be ( 2.300 @xmath4 0.012 )  m@xmath5 , assuming that the periastron advance is purely relativistic . under the same assumption , we constrain the pulsar s mass to be @xmath6  m@xmath5  and the companion s mass to be @xmath7  m@xmath5  ( both 99% confidence ) . given the total system mass and the distribution of measured neutron star masses , the companion is probably a massive white dwarf which formed prior to the birth of the pulsar . </S>",
