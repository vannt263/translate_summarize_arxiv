    "however , this increase is due to galaxies appearing on the red - sequence , which were previously blue , and not due to in - situ growth on the red - sequence itself .",
    "this can be clearly seen by massive galaxies gradually moving onto the red - sequence with time .",
    "this effect is also revealed in the decline in the number of blue massive galaxies found in the universe since @xmath1 ( e.g. , bundy et al . 2006 ) .",

    "the remainder of the excess must be produced through merging . in conselice",
    "et al . ( 2007b ) it is argued that the amount of merging is such that at least one major merger is occurring for m@xmath3 galaxies at @xmath4 . since these galaxies are largely early - types , it is likely that many of these mergers are dry ( see also bell et al .",

    "massive galaxies at @xmath7 are not smooth ellipticals , but appear peculiar , even in the rest - frame optical ( conselice et al .",
    "in fact , the cas values for these galaxies reveals a merger fraction of roughly 40 - 50% ( conselice et al .",

    "<S> understanding the formation history of massive galaxies is one of most popular and longstanding problems in astronomy , with observations and theory addressing how and when these systems assembled . </S>",
    "<S> since the most massive galaxies in today s universe , with m@xmath0 , are nearly all elliptical with uniform old stellar populations , we must probe higher redshifts to discover their full origins . </S>",
    "<S> a recent consensus has developed that nearly all m@xmath0 galaxies we see today were established by @xmath1 , with at most a factor of two growth in stellar mass and number densities at lower redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we review the evidence for this , and discuss how recent observations of star formation rates , colors , and morphologies of massive galaxies at @xmath2 with m@xmath3 show that these systems are still experiencing some evolution . </S>",
    "<S> massive galaxies undergo on average a single major merger at @xmath4 , and roughly half are experiencing star formation at the same redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the highest mass galaxies , with m@xmath3 , appear in similar abundance at @xmath5 , suggesting that extremely massive galaxies are mostly formed very early in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> observations at @xmath6 demonstrate that major galaxy mergers are the primary method for assembling these massive galaxies , with nearly all of this merging occurring at @xmath7 , with on average 4 to 5 major mergers taking place at @xmath8 . </S>"
