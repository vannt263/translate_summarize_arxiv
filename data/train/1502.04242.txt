    "we consider the model of _ catalytic branching process _ ( cbp ) with a finite number of catalysts .",
    "it describes a system of particles moving in space and branching only in the presence of catalysts .",
    "more exactly , let at the initial time @xmath6 there be a single particle that moves on some finite or countable set @xmath7 according to a continuous - time markov chain @xmath8 generated by infinitesimal matrix @xmath9 .",
    "when this particle hits a finite set of catalysts @xmath10 , say at the site @xmath11 , it spends there random time having the exponential distribution with parameter @xmath12 . afterwards",
    "the particle either branches or leaves the site @xmath11 with probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , respectively .",
    "if the particle branches ( at the site @xmath11 ) , it dies and just before the death produces a random non - negative integer number @xmath16 of offsprings located at the same site @xmath11 . if the particle leaves @xmath11 , it jumps to the site @xmath17 with probability @xmath18 and continues its movement governed by the markov chain @xmath19 .",
    "all newly born particles are supposed to behave as independent copies of their parent .",
    "we assume that the markov chain @xmath19 is irreducible and the matrix @xmath20 is conservative ( i.e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for any @xmath25 ) . denote by @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] , the probability generating function of @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "we will employ the standard assumption of existence of a finite derivative @xmath30 , that is the finiteness of @xmath31 , for any @xmath29 .",
    "study of cbp with a single catalyst was initiated even in the xx century ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this",
    "regard we also mention a recent paper @xcite where the main tool for the moment analysis of the process was the spine technique , i.e. `` many - to - few lemma '' , and renewal theory . note that the generalization to an arbitrary finite set of catalysts is not straightforward , since there exists a `` competition '' between catalysts .",
    "an important special case of several catalysts ( where @xmath32 , @xmath1 , and the markov chain @xmath19 is symmetric space - homogeneous random walk with finite variance of jump sizes ) was examined in @xcite .",
    "there the sufficient conditions for exponential growth of the particles numbers were obtained by analyzing spectral properties of evolution operators .",
    "we propose another way permitting to establish more precise results .    for branching processes",
    "the natural interesting problem is the analysis of asymptotic behavior ( as @xmath33 ) of the local and total size of population at time @xmath34 ( for various branching processes without catalysts see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath35 stand for the total number of particles existing in cbp at time @xmath36 . in a similar way we define local numbers @xmath37 as quantities of particles located at separate points @xmath38 at time @xmath34 . in this paper",
    "our aim is three - fold .",
    "firstly , we introduce a classification of cbp ( with @xmath2 catalysts ) treating it as _ supercritical , critical or subcritical _ whenever one has , for the perron root @xmath39 of a certain @xmath3 matrix , @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , respectively . moreover , the criticality set @xmath4 revealing the influence of catalysts strength is introduced and characterized .",
    "secondly , we implement the moment analysis of the local and total particles numbers to justify the naturalness of the proposed classification ( indeed , one will see that the asymptotic behavior of the moments of any order is determined essentially by the introduced class of cbp ) .",
    "thirdly , we consider some particular cases of cbp and thereby show that our study not only generalizes the results in previous works but even refines them .",
    "our approach consists in involving hitting times under taboo ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , ch.2 , sec.11 ) and construction of auxiliary bellman - harris branching processes with at most @xmath43 types of particles .",
    "this approach is inspired by @xcite where the branching random walk on @xmath44 with a single catalyst was investigated by means of introducing hitting times ( without taboo ) and a due two - type bellman - harris process .",
    "note also that in @xcite , for the study of a discrete - time branching random walk on @xmath45 with multiple catalysts , the authors considered an embedded multi - type galton - watson branching process , resulting in `` forgetting / erasing the time spent between catalysts '' .",
    "the latter approach is fruitful for classification of branching random walk since multi - type galton - watson and multi - type bellman - harris processes have the same supercritical , critical or subcritical regimes .",
    "however , for subsequent study of branching random walks ( moment analysis , limit theorems etc . )",
    "multi - type galton - watson process is not sufficient and thus ph.carmona and y.hu used in @xcite another technique such as `` many - to - few lemmas '' .",
    "our first auxiliary process is constructed in such a way that the study of cbp can be mainly reduced to analysis of the bellman - harris process .",
    "the number of particles in this process is chosen to guarantee its indecomposability and can not be less than @xmath2 and need not be greater than @xmath46 .",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite , ch.4 , sec.5 , 6 and 7 ) that an indecomposable multi - type bellman - harris process is classified as supercritical , critical or subcritical according to the value of the perron root of the mean matrix .",
    "this is the foundation for classification of cbp .",
    "furthermore , lemma [ l : perron_root ] below gives even more convenient classification with the help of the perron root of a specified irreducible @xmath3 matrix .",
    "one more auxiliary bellman - harris process is indispensable for study of total particles numbers in cbp in case of transient markov chain @xmath19 .",
    "this process is taken to be decomposable with a final type of particles .",
    "the treatment of the auxiliary bellman - harris processes allows us not only to classify cbp but also to derive a system of renewal equations for the mean local and total particles numbers in cbp . afterwards , to implement the moment analysis of the local and total particles numbers we use multidimensional renewal theorems established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this approach has advantages since there is elaborated theory of multi - type bellman - harris processes and a vast majority of its results can be applied to the auxiliary bellman - harris processes leading to the new results for cbp .",
    "mention in passing some recent works on multi - type bellman - harris processes , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "observe also that cbp can be considered as a markov branching process with at most countably many types of particles , since the location of a particle can be associated with its type .",
    "theory of branching processes with countably many types of particles , despite of its long history ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , has not been systematized until now in view of its complexity .",
    "some new papers such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite make an important contribution to this research direction .",
    "however , the study there does not cover the results presented in our paper . among other investigations of models describing particles movement and breeding",
    "we refer to recent papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "branching random walks analyzed there are homogeneous in space whereas the main feature of cbp is spatial non - homogeneity .",
    "some differences in behavior of a homogeneous branching random walk on @xmath45 and its catalytic counterpart are discussed in @xcite .",
    "concluding the introduction we mention the close relation between a catalytic branching random walk on @xmath45 and a super - brownian motion with a single point catalyst ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "now we describe the structure of the paper . in section [ s : abhp ]",
    "we specify the first auxiliary bellman - harris process and propose a classification for cbp .",
    "section  [ s : scs ] is devoted to solution of the following problem .",
    "assume that we fix the markov chain generator @xmath20 in cbp and vary `` intensities '' of catalysts , e.g. , @xmath47 , @xmath29 .",
    "what is the set @xmath48 such that cbp is critical iff @xmath49 ?",
    "in particular , what is the proportion of `` weak '' and `` powerful '' catalysts ( possessing small or large values of @xmath50 , respectively ) in critical regime ?",
    "in section [ s : scs ] we obtain a complete description of @xmath4 by means of equation involving determinants of some matrices , indicate the smallest parallelepiped @xmath51\\times \\ldots \\times [ 0,m_n]$ ] containing @xmath4 and illustrate our approach by two pictures of the set @xmath4 when @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "observe that these plots are not a product of simulation and display the result of direct computation .",
    "section [ s : macbp ] contains theorem [ t : macbp ] and its proof representing the moment analysis of the local and total particles numbers in cbp .",
    "there we construct the second auxiliary bellman - harris process required for study of the total size of population whenever markov chain @xmath19 is transient .",
    "section  [ s : applications ] demonstrates applications of our results to the catalytic branching random walk on @xmath0 and to the branching process with a single catalyst .",
    "a detailed comparison of our results with those known before is given as well .",
    "let us briefly describe a bellman - harris branching process with particles of @xmath54 types , @xmath55 .",
    "it is initiated by a single particle of type @xmath56 .",
    "the parent particle has a random life - length with a cumulative distribution function ( c.d.f . )",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath36 .",

    "the bellman - harris branching process is called _ indecomposable _ if the non - negative matrix @xmath64 is _ irreducible _ ( for the latter notion , see , e.g. , @xcite , ch.1 , sec.3 ) . moreover , if its perron root @xmath39 ( i.e. eigenvalue having the maximal modulus ) is such that @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , then the bellman - harris process is called supercritical , critical or subcritical , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite , ch.4 , sec.5 , 6 and 7 ) .",
    "denote the number of particles of type @xmath65 existing at time @xmath34 by @xmath66 , @xmath36 , @xmath67 .    before demonstrating",
    "how an auxiliary bellman - harris process can be constructed in the framework of cbp we have to introduce some notation .",
    "consider a particle moving on the set @xmath7 in accordance with the markov chain generated by @xmath20 and starting at state @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , be the time spent by the particle after leaving the starting point @xmath68 until the first hitting @xmath72 if the particle s trajectory does not pass @xmath73 .",
    "otherwise ( if the particle s trajectory passes @xmath73 before the first hitting @xmath72 ) , @xmath74 .",
    "the ( extended ) random variable @xmath69 is called a _ hitting time _ of state @xmath72 _ under taboo _ @xmath73 after the first exit out of the starting state @xmath68 .",

    "of @xmath69 .",
    "evidently , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the kronecker delta .",
    "explicit formulae for the probability of finiteness of @xmath69 , i.e. for @xmath78 , via taboo probabilities and green s function were derived in @xcite . whenever the taboo set @xmath73 is empty",
    "we write @xmath79 and @xmath80 instead of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "return to cbp .",
    "we tentatively assume that cbp starts at @xmath83 for some @xmath84",
    ". set @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the cardinality of a finite set .",
    "we divide the particles population existing at time @xmath36 into @xmath91 groups with @xmath92 .",
    "the particles located at time @xmath34 at @xmath93 form the @xmath65-th group having cardinality @xmath94 , @xmath87 . consider a family consisting of particles which have left @xmath93 at least once within time interval @xmath95 $ ] , upon the last leaving @xmath93 have not yet reached @xmath96 by time @xmath34 but eventually will hit @xmath97 before possible hitting @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath87 .",
    "this family has cardinality denoted by @xmath100 and corresponds to the group number @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "the group number @xmath91 comprises the rest of particles not included into the above @xmath103 groups .",
    "note that the last group consists of the particles having infinite life - lengths since after time @xmath34 they will not hit the set of catalysts any more .",
    "so , after time @xmath34 these particles will not produce any offsprings and have no influence on the numbers of particles in other @xmath103 groups .",
    "now we can introduce an auxiliary bellman - harris process to employ it for the study of cbp .",
    "consider an @xmath103-dimensional bellman - harris process starting with a single particle of type @xmath104 and having the following c.d.f . and offspring generating functions @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath99 , @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to see that for the process constructed in this way the vector @xmath110 , at each @xmath36 , has the same distribution as the vector whose @xmath65-th component is @xmath111 and @xmath101-th component is @xmath100 , @xmath99 , @xmath87",
    ".    mean matrix @xmath112 of the introduced bellman - harris process is of block form , i.e. @xmath113 here the @xmath3 matrix @xmath114 possesses the following entries @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath87 , the elements of @xmath116 matrix @xmath117 vanish everywhere except for the @xmath65-th row and for @xmath118 one has @xmath119 . when @xmath120 the @xmath121 matrix @xmath122 is such that omitting its @xmath65-th null columns for all @xmath123 one gets the @xmath124 identity matrix . for @xmath125 , the @xmath126 matrices @xmath127 have zero entries .",
    "let us verify that the specified bellman - harris process is indecomposable .",
    "in view of irreducibility of the markov chain @xmath19 there exists a finite path from @xmath11 to @xmath128 with a positive probability for each @xmath129 . in the framework of cbp such path",
    "has also positive probability , since being at catalyst site @xmath130 a particle can leave it without branching with positive probability @xmath131 for each @xmath120 . among the sites visited successively by that path of @xmath19",
    "choose those from @xmath96 , say , @xmath132 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 . by the construction of auxiliary bellman - harris process this path corresponds to transformations of a particle type from @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "namely , if the path of @xmath19 hits @xmath137 immediately after leaving @xmath138 then the particle type in bellman - harris process changes from @xmath139 to @xmath140 . otherwise , @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath142 for some @xmath143 , and the particle type change from @xmath139 to @xmath140 involves the intermediate type @xmath144 .",
    "hence , we conclude that , for each @xmath135 and @xmath136 from @xmath145 , there exists @xmath146 and a collection @xmath147 such that @xmath148 .",
    "since by matrix @xmath64 definition in ( [ matrix_m= ] ) one has @xmath149 and @xmath150 for each @xmath99 and @xmath87 , the previous statement holds true for @xmath151 as well .",

    "thereby , in this case we have shown that @xmath64 is a _ primitive _ matrix ( see , e.g. , @xcite , ch.1 , sec.3 ) .    on account of the perron - frobenius theorem for irreducible matrices ( see , e.g. , @xcite , ch.1 , sec.4 ) the matrix @xmath64 has a positive real eigenvalue @xmath159 of maximal modulus which is called the _ perron root _ of @xmath64 . using the classification of the constructed bellman - harris process we call cbp _ supercritical _ , _ critical _ or _ subcritical _ if @xmath160 , @xmath161 or @xmath162 , respectively , where @xmath64 is specified by ( [ matrix_m= ] ) .",
    "since @xmath64 is independent of the cbp starting point , the same is true for the classification of cbp .",
