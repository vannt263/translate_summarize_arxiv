    "the dipole moment of any _ finite _ @xmath0electron system in its ground state is a simple and well defined quantity .",
    "given the many  body wavefunction @xmath1 and the corresponding single ",
    "particle density @xmath2 the electronic contribution to the dipole is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( atomic hartree units are adopted throughout ) .",
    "this looks very trivial , but we are exploiting here an essential fact : the ground wavefunction of any finite @xmath0electron system is square  integrable and vanishes exponentially at infinity ; the density vanishes exponentially as well .",
    "considering now a macroscopic solid , the related quantity is macroscopic polarization , which is a very essential concept in any phenomenological description of dielectric media  @xcite : this quantity is ideally defined as the dipole of a macroscopic sample , divided by its volume .",
    "the point is that , when using , the integral is dominated by what happens at the surface of the sample : knowledge of the electronic distribution in the bulk region is not enough to unambiguosly determine the dipole .",
    "this looks like a paradox , since in the thermodynamic limit macroscopic polarization must be an intensive quantity , insensitive to surface effects .",
    "macroscopic polarization in the bulk region of the solid must be determined by what `` happens '' in the bulk as well .",
    "this is the case if one assumes a model of discrete and well separated dipoles ,  la clausius - mossotti : but real dielectrics are very much different from such an extreme model .",
    "the valence electronic distribution is continuous , and often very delocalized ( particularly in covalent dielectrics ) .",
    "most textbooks attempt at explaining the polarization of a periodic crystal via the dipole moment of a unit cell , or something of the kind @xcite .",
    "these definitions are incorrect @xcite : according to the modern viewpoint , bulk macroscopic polarization is a physical observable _ completely independent _ from the periodic charge distribution of the polarized crystalline dielectric .    in condensed matter physics the standard way for getting rid of undesired surface effects is to adopt periodic born - von krmn boundary conditions ( bvk ) .",
    "indeed , the bvk choice is mandatory in order to introduce even the most elementary topics , such as the free  electron gas and its fermi energy , or the bloch theorem @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the adoption of bvk does not solve the polarization problem .",
    "in fact the dipole _ can not _ be evaluated as in when the wavefunction obeys bvk : the integrals are ill  defined due to the unbounded nature of the quantum  mechanical position operator .",
    "for this reason macroscopic polarization remained a major challenge in electronic structure theory for many years .",
    "the breakthrough came in 1992 , when polarization was defined in terms of the wavefunctions , not of the charge .",
    "this definition has an unambiguous thermodynamic limit , such that bvk and bloch states can be used with no harm  @xcite . in the following months",
    "a modern theory of macroscopic polarization in crystalline dielectrics has been completely established @xcite , thanks to a major advance due to r.d .",
    "king - smith and d. vanderbilt @xcite , who expressed polarization in terms of a berry phase @xcite . a comprehensive account of the modern theory exists @xcite .",
    "other less technical presentations are available as well @xcite ; for an oversimplified nontechnical outline see ref .",
    "principle calculations based on this theory have been performed for several crystalline materials , either within dft ( using various basis sets ) or within hf ( using lcao basis sets )  @xcite .",
    "all of the above quoted work refers to a crystalline system within an independent  electron formulation : the single  particle orbitals have then the bloch form , and the macroscopic polarization is evaluated as a berry phase of them .",
    "the related , but substantially different , problem of macroscopic polarization in a correlated many ",
    "electron system was first solved by ortz and martin in 1994  @xcite . however , according to them , polarization is defined  and computed  @xcite  by means of a peculiar `` ensemble average '' , integrating over a set of different electronic ground states : this was much later ( 1998 ) shown to be unnecessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in fact , a simpler viewpoint is taken : the polarization of a correlated solid is defined by means of a `` pure state '' expectation value , although a rather exotic kind of one . by the same token",
    ", it was also possible to define  @xcite  and to compute  @xcite  macroscopic polarization in noncrystalline systems .    in the present work we take advantage of the most recent developments for reconsidering the whole theory under a new light .",
    "at variance with previous presentations we are not going to introduce _ explicitly _ the berry phase concept : in fact , within the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the berry phase appears very much `` in disguise '' . instead , a major role is played by a precursor work  @xcite , apparently unrelated either to the polarization problem or to a berry phase , which will be reexamined here and used to introduce the polarization theory .",
    "finally , let me just mention a latest development , not to be discussed in the present work , where ideas spawned from the polarization theory  and more specifically from ref .",
    "@xcite  are used to investigate wavefunction localization  @xcite .",
    "adopting a given choice for the boundary conditions is tantamount to defining the hilbert space where our solutions of schrdinger s equation live . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", i am presenting the basic concept by means of the one  dimensional case . for a single  particle wavefunction bvk",
    "reads @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the imposed periodicity , chosen to be large with respect to atomic dimensions .",
    "notice that lattice periodicity is _ not _ assumed , and bvk applies to disordered systems as well .    by definition , an operator maps any vector of the given hilbert space into another vector belonging to the same space : the multiplicative position operator @xmath7 is therefore _ not _ a legitimate operator when bvk are adopted for the state vectors , since @xmath8 is not a periodic function whenever @xmath9 is such .",
    "it is then obvious why can not be used in condensed matter theory .",
    "of course , any periodic function of @xmath7 is a legitimate multiplicative operator in the hilbert space : this is the case _",
    "e.g. _ of the nuclear potential acting on the electrons .    before switching to the polarization problem , it is expedient to discuss an important precursor work , apparently unrelated to the polarization problem , where nonetheless the expectation value of the position operator plays the key role .",
    "some years ago , a. selloni",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite addressed the properties of electrons dissolved in molten salts at high dilution , in a paper which at the time was commonly nicknamed the `` electron in broth '' .",
    "the physical problem was studied by means of a mixed quantum ",
    "classical simulation , where a lone electron was adiabatically moving in a molten salt ( the `` broth '' ) at finite temperature .",
    "the simulation cell contained 32 cations , 31 anions , and a single electron .",
    "kcl was the original case study , which therefore addressed the liquid state analogue of an f center ; other systems were studied afterwards @xcite . the motion of the ions was assumed as completely classical , and the newton equations of motion were integrated by means of standard molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques , though the ionic motion was coupled to the quantum degree of freedom of the electron .",
    "the electronic ground wavefunction was determined solving the time ",
    "dependent schrdinger s equation at each md time step . as usual in md simulations , periodic boundary conditions were adopted for the classical ionic motion .",
    "ideally , the ionic motion occurs in a simulation cell which is surrounded by periodic replicas : inter - cell interactions are accounted for , thus avoiding surface effects .",
    "analogously , the electronic wavefunction is chosen in the work of selloni _ et al . _ to obey bvk over the simulation cell , and therefore features periodic replicas as well .",
    "a plot of such an electronic distribution , in a schematic one  dimensional analogue , is given in fig .  1",
    ".    one of the main properties investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite was the electronic diffusion , where the thermal ionic motion is the driving agent ( within the adiabatic approximation ) . in order to perform this study",
    ", one has to identify first of all where the `` center '' of the electronic distribution is .",
    "intuitively , the distribution in fig .  1 appears to have a `` center '' , which however is defined only modulo the replica periodicity , and furthermore _ can not _",
    "be evaluated simply as in , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 , precisely because of bvk .",
    "et al . _ solved the problem by means of a very elegant and far  reaching formula , presented below .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite can be regarded as the many ",
    "body generalization of it .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the key quantity for dealing with the position operator within bvk is the dimensionless complex number @xmath11 , defined as : @xmath12 whose modulus is no larger than 1 . the most general electron density , such as the one depicted in fig .",
    "1 , can always be written as a superposition of a function @xmath13 , normalized over @xmath14 , and of its periodic replicas : @xmath15 both @xmath16 and @xmath17 have a large arbitrariness : we restrict it a little bit by imposing that @xmath16 is the center of the distribution , in the sense that @xmath18 . using eq .",
    "( [ replicas ] ) , @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of the fourier transform of @xmath19 as : @xmath20 if the electron is localized in a region of space much smaller than @xmath6 , its fourier transform is smooth over reciprocal distances of the order of @xmath21 and can be expanded as : @xmath22 a very natural definition of the center of a localized periodic distribution @xmath23 is therefore provided by the phase of @xmath11 as : @xmath24 which is in fact the formula first proposed by selloni _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . the expectation value @xmath25 is defined modulo @xmath6 , as expected since @xmath23 is bvk periodic .",
    "the above expressions imply @xmath26 ; in the special case where @xmath13 can be taken as an even ( centrosymmetric ) function , its fourier transform is real and yields indeed @xmath27 . in the case of extreme delocalization",
    "we have instead @xmath28 and @xmath29 : hence the center of the distribution @xmath30 , according to , is ill  defined . for a more general delocalized state",
    ", we expect that @xmath11 goes to zero at large @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore arrived at a definition of @xmath30 within bvk which has many of the desirable features we were looking for : nonetheless , there is a property that is even more important , and which we are going to demonstrate now .",
    "suppose the potential which the electron moves in has a slow time dependence  as was the case in ref .",
    "@xcite  and we wish to follow the adiabatic evolution of the electronic state @xmath31 .",
    "if we call @xmath32 the instantaneous eigenstates at time @xmath33 , the lowest order adiabatic evolution of the ground  state density matrix is  @xcite : @xmath34 where the phases have been chosen in order to make @xmath35 orthogonal to its time derivative @xmath36 .",
    "the macroscopic electrical current flowing through the system at time @xmath33 is therefore : @xmath37 it is then rather straightforward to prove that @xmath38 to lowest order in @xmath39 equals @xmath40 , where @xmath30 is evaluated using in the instantaneous ground eigenstate : @xmath41 this finding proves the value of the `` electron  in  broth '' formula , in studying electron transport  @xcite .",
    "so much about the one  electron problem : we are now going to consider a finite density of electrons in the periodic box . to start with",
    ", irrelevant spin variables will be neglected : for the sake of notation simplicity , i will first illustrate the main concepts on a system of `` spinless electrons '' .    even for a system of independent electrons ,",
    "our approach takes a simple and compact form if a many  body formulation is adopted .",
    "bvk then imposes periodicity in each electronic variable separately : @xmath42 our interest is indeed in studying a bulk system : @xmath0 electrons in a segment of length @xmath6 , where eventually the thermodynamic limit is taken : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 constant .",
    "we also assume the ground state nondegenerate , and we deal with insulating systems only : this means that the gap between the ground eigenvalue and the excited ones remains finite for @xmath46 .",
    "we start defining the one  dimensional analogue of @xmath47 , namely , the multiplicative operator @xmath48 , and the complex number @xmath49 it is obvious that the operator @xmath50 is ill  defined in our hilbert space , while its complex exponential appearing in is well defined .",
    "the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the ground ",
    "state expectation value of the position operator is given by the analogue of , namely : @xmath51 a quantity defined modulo @xmath6 as above .",
    "the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) is not simply the expectation value of an operator : the given form , as the imaginary part of a logarithm , is indeed essential .",
    "furthermore , its main ingredient is the expectation value of the multiplicative operator @xmath52 : it is important to realize that this is a genuine _ many  body _ operator . in general",
    ", one defines an operator to be one ",
    "body whenever it is the _ sum _ of @xmath0 identical operators , acting on each electronic coordinate separately : for instance , the @xmath50 operator is such . in order to express the expectation value of a one  body operator the full many  body wavefunction",
    "is not needed : knowledge of the one  body reduced density matrix @xmath53 is enough : i stress that , instead , the expectation value of @xmath54 over a correlated wavefunction _ can not _ be expressed in terms of @xmath53 , and knowledge of the @xmath0-electron wavefunction is explicitly needed . in the special case of a single  determinant ,",
    "the @xmath0-particle wavefunction is uniquely determined by the one  body reduced density matrix @xmath53 ( which is the projector over the set of the occupied single  particle orbitals ) : therefore the expectation value @xmath55 , , is uniquely determined by @xmath53 .",
    "but this is peculiar to uncorrelated wavefunctions only : this case is discussed in detail below .    as in the one  body case , whenever the many ",
    "body hamiltonian is slowly varying in time , the macroscopic electrical current flowing through the system is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is evaluated using in the instantaneous ground eigenstate of the hamiltonian at time @xmath33 : this result is proved in ref .",
    "considering now the limit of a large system , @xmath57 is an extensive quantity : the macroscopic current @xmath58 , , goes therefore to a well defined thermodynamic limit .",
    "we stress that nowhere in our presentation have we assumed crystalline periodicity .",
    "therefore our definition of @xmath57 is very general : it applies to any condensed system , either ordered or disordered , either independent  electron or correlated .",
    "( 14,5.2 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 7,4 )    in the introduction , we have discussed what polarization is _ not _ , by outlining some incorrect definitions  @xcite and their problems  @xcite .",
    "we have not stated yet what polarization really _ is _ : to this aim , a few experimental facts are worth recalling .",
    "the absolute polarization of a crystal in a given state has never been measured as a bulk property , independent of sample termination . instead , well known bulk properties are _ derivatives _ of the polarization with respect to suitable perturbations : permittivity , pyroelectricity , piezoelectricity , dynamical charges , in one important case ",
    "namely , ferroelectricity  the relevant bulk property is inferred from the measurement of a finite difference ( polarization reversal ) . in all cases , the derivative or the difference in the polarization",
    "is typically accessed via the measurement of a macroscopic current .",
    "for instance , to measure the piezoelectric effect , the sample is typically strained along the piezoelectric axis while being shorted out with a capacitor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : piezo ] ) .",
    "the theory discussed here only concerns phenomena where the macroscopic polarization is induced by a source other than an electric field . even in this case",
    ", the polarization may ( or may not ) be _ accompanied _ by a field , depending on the boundary conditions chosen for the macroscopic sample .",
    "the theory addresses polarization differences _ in zero field _ :",
    "this concerns therefore lattice dynamics , piezoelectricity ( as in the ideal experiment sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : piezo ] ) , and ferroelectricity .",
    "notably , the theory reported here _ does not _ address the problem of evaluating the dielectric constant : this can be done using alternative approaches , such as the well  established linear ",
    "response theory  @xcite , or other more innovative theories  @xcite .",
    "the bulk quantity of interest , to be compared with experimental measurements , is the polarization difference between two states of the given solid , connected by an adiabiatic transformation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the electronic term in this difference is : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the current flowing through the sample while the potential is adiabatically varied , _",
    "i.e. _ precisely the quantity discussed in the previous section ,",
    ". notice that in the adiabatic limit @xmath61 goes to infinity and @xmath60 goes to zero , while yields a finite value , which only depends on the initial and final states .",
    "we may therefore write : @xmath62 where it is understood that is to be used twice , with the final and with the initial ground states , in order to evaluate the quantity of interest @xmath63 .",
    "notice that @xmath43 in is a rather unconventional limit , since the exponential operator goes formally to the identity , but the size of the system and the number of electrons in the wavefunction increase with @xmath6 .",
    "we now specialize to an uncorrelated system of independent electrons , whose @xmath0-electron wavefunction @xmath64 is a slater determinant .",
    "as discussed above , in this case the expectation value @xmath57 , eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) , is uniquely determined by the one  body density matrix . however , the formulation is simpler when expressing @xmath57 and the resulting polarization @xmath65 directly in terms of the orbitals .",
    "we restore explicit spin variables from now on .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is even , and @xmath66 is a singlet .",
    "the slater determinant has thus the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the single - particle orbitals .",
    "it is then expedient to define @xmath69 even @xmath70 is indeed a slater determinant , where each orbital @xmath71 of @xmath72 is multiplied by the plane wave @xmath73 . according to a well known theorem ,",
    "the overlap amongst two determinants is equal to the determinant of the overlap matrix amongst the orbitals .",
    "we therefore define the matrix ( of size @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 in terms of which we easily get @xmath76 where the factor of 2 accounts for double spin occupancy , and the expression becomes accurate in the limit of a large system .",
    "the expression of goes under the name of `` single ",
    "point berry phase '' ( almost an oxymoron ! ) , and was first proposed by the present author in a volume of lecture notes  @xcite . since then , its three - dimensional generalization has been used in a series of dft calculations for noncrystalline systems  @xcite , and has been scrutinized in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the case of a crystalline system of independent electrons is the one which historically has been solved first  @xcite , though along a very different logical path  @xcite than adopted here .",
    "i am going to outline how the present formalism leads to the earlier results .    for the sake of simplifying notations",
    ", i am going to consider the case of an insulator having only one completely occupied band .",
    "the single  particle orbitals may be chosen in the bloch form : indeed , the canonical ones _ must _ have the bloch form .",
    "body wavefunction , , becomes in the crystalline case : @xmath77 $ : \\begin{equation } q_s = \\frac{4 \\pi}{n a } s , \\quad s=1,2 , \\dots , n/2 .",
    "\\label{points } \\end{equation }    owing to the orthogonality properties of the bloch functions , the overlap matrix elements in \\equ{overlap } vanish except when $ q_{s ' } = q_s - 2\\pi /l$ , that is $ s ' = s\\!-\\!1 $ : therefore the determinant in \\equ{single } factors as { \\begin{equation}}p   = \\frac{1}{\\pi } \\mbox{im ln } \\prod_{s=1}^{n/2 } \\langle \\psi_{q_s } | { \\rm e}^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{l } x } | \\psi_{q_{s-1 } } \\rangle , \\label{berry}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is implicitly understood ( so  called periodic gauge ) .",
    "the expression in is precisely the one first proposed by king ",
    "smith and vanderbilt  @xcite as a discretized form for the berry phase : in fact , the multi  band three  dimensional generalization of is the standard formula  @xcite implemented in first ",
    "principle calculations  @xcite of macroscopic polarization in crystalline dielectrics , either within dft or hf .",
    "the modern viewpoint about macroscopic polarization has even spawned a critical rethinking of density  functional theory in extended systems .",
    "the debate started in 1995 with a paper by gonze , ghosez , and godby  @xcite , and continues these days  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of polarization provided in the present work allows discussing the issue in a very simple way .    the celebrated hohenberg ",
    "kohn ( hk ) theorem , upon which dft is founded  @xcite , states that there exists a universal functional @xmath79 $ ] , which determines the exact ground  state energy and all other ground  state properties of the system .",
    "the main hypotheses are that the magnetic field is vanishing , the ground state is non degenerate , and  most important to the present purposes  the system is _ finite _ , with a square  integrable ground wavefunction .",
    "this is precisely the key point when dealing with an extended system .    ideally , it is possible to refer to a macroscopic but finite system : polarization is then by definition the dipole divided by the volume , and safely applies . as a consequence ,",
    "the polarization of the real interacting system is identical to the one of the fictitious noninteracting kohn  sham ( ks ) system .",
    "unfortunately , such polarization depends on the charge distribution both in the bulk and at the surface : according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this fact implies a possible `` ultranonlocality '' in the ks potential : two systems having the same density in the bulk region may have qualitatively different ks potentials in the same region , and different polarizations as well .",
    "the issue can be formulated in a more transparent way by recasting it in the language of the present work .    as discussed in the introduction",
    ", condensed matter theory invariably works in a different way : one adopts bvk since the very beginning , and the system has no surface by construction .",
    "the original hk theorem was formulated for the case where the schrdinger s equation is solved imposing square ",
    "integrable boundary conditions , but the same theorem holds within bvk , with an identical proof , for a _ finite _ @xmath0-electron system .",
    "we can then define , even within bvk , the fictitious ks system of noninteracting electrons , having the same density as the interacting one : if the system is crystalline , the ks orbitals have the bloch form .",
    "now the question becomes : do the interacting system and the corresponding ks noninteracting one have the same polarization ?",
    "the answer is actually `` no '' : in fact , within bvk , polarization is _ not _ a function of the density , not even of the one  body density matrix , as stressed above",
    ". numerical evidence of the fact that the two polarizations are not equal has been given  @xcite .",
    "other important implications concern the occurrence of macroscopic electric fields within dft : we refer to the original literature  @xcite about this issue , while here we limit ourselves to just remarking an important point .",
    "the potential ( both one  body and two  body ) within the schrdinger s equation must be bvk periodic , otherwise the hamiltonian is an ill  defined operator in the hilbert space .",
    "the periodicity of the potential is tantamount to enforcing a vanishing macroscopic electric field : therefore some _ ad  hoc _ strategies must be devised in order to cope with nonzero electric fields , as is indeed done in refs .",
