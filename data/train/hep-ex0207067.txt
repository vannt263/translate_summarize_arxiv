    "<S> we use this fraction as a constraint when fitting the dalitz distribution . to model the background contribution in the dalitz distribution we consider those events in the data that are in sidebands five to ten standard deviations from the signal in @xmath69 and @xmath60 and within three in @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> there are 445 candidates in this selection , about four times the amount of background we estimate from the signal region . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these with background from our simulation also including @xmath0 annihilations producing the lighter quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the background from the simulation is dominated by random combinations of unrelated tracks , and the shape of the background in the simulation and the sideband data sample agree well . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation predicts that the background uniformly populates the allowed phase space , and we model this contribution to the dalitz distribution by fitting the data sideband sample to a two dimensional cubic polynomial in ( @xmath82,@xmath83 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the latter , called mistags , are especially dangerous to our search for `` wrong sign '' @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> mistags populate the dalitz distribution in a known way that depends on the shape of signal . </S>",
    "<S> when we analyze the dalitz distribution we allow a mistag fraction with an unconstrained contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have looked for the contribution of an anomalous resonance , such as @xmath87 or @xmath88 , plus random tracks to the background in the data by studying the sidebands in @xmath69 , @xmath60 , and @xmath67 , and conclude that any such contributions are negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : proj ] shows the dalitz distribution for the @xmath80 candidates . </S>",
    "<S> a rich structure is evident . </S>",
    "<S> contributions from @xmath89 and @xmath90 are apparent . </S>",
    "<S> depopulated regions exist suggesting destructive interference between some resonances and the dominant decay modes .    </S>",
    "<S> we parameterize the @xmath51 dalitz distribution following the methodology described in ref .  @xcite using the same sign convention used in previous investigations of this decay channel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider nineteen resonant subcomponents , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and the `` wrong sign '' @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as well as a non - resonant contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the resonances are taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite except for the @xmath110 s . </S>",
    "<S> we use ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the @xmath111 and the coupled channel analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that each of the resonances has its own amplitude and relative phase . </S>",
    "<S> the non - resonant contribution is modeled as a uniform distribution across the allowed phase space with a fixed relative phase . </S>",
    "<S> the phases and widths of the resonance contributions vary as given by the spin of the resonance as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this study is sensitive only to relative phases and amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> thus we fix one phase and one amplitude . to minimize correlated errors on the phases and amplitudes we choose the largest color suppressed mode , @xmath98 , which should be out of phase with the unsuppressed modes to have a fixed zero phase and an amplitude of one . since the choice of normalization , phase convention , and amplitude formalism may not always be identical for different experiments , fit fractions </S>",
    "<S> are reported in addition to amplitudes to allow for more meaningful comparisons between results . </S>",
    "<S> the fit fraction is defined as the integral of a single component divided by the coherent sum of all components . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the fit fractions for all components will in general not be unity because of the effect of interference .    </S>",
    "<S> backgrounds , combinatorics and mistags , are considered as described above . </S>",
    "<S> they do not interfere with the signal , but the mistag background shape depends on the signal shape as noted earlier .    </S>",
    "<S> one must also consider the statistical errors on the fit fractions . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen to use the full covariance matrix from the fits to determine the errors on fit fractions so that the assigned errors will properly include the correlated components of the errors on the amplitudes and phases . </S>",
    "<S> after each fit , the covariance matrix and final parameter values are used to generate 500 sample parameter sets . for each set , </S>",
    "<S> the fit fractions are calculated and recorded in histograms . </S>",
    "<S> each histogram is fit with a single gaussian to extract its width , which is used as a measure of the statistical error on the fit fraction .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform an initial fit , using the unbinned maximum likelihood technique including the resonances observed by e687  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider each of the intermediates states listed above retaining those that are more than three standard deviations significant . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find the @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath97 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and the``wrong sign '' @xmath109 to be significant . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath102 is a special case . </S>",
    "<S> it is excluded in our standard fit , and its possible contribution is discussed further below . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining ten resonances , a non - resonant contribution , and backgrounds as described above are included in our standard fit and give our central results . </S>",
    "<S> table [ tab : fit ] gives the results of our standard fit . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : proj ] shows the three projections of the fit .    we note that there is a significant `` wrong sign '' @xmath115 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> mistags are not significant , having a rate of @xmath116% . </S>",
    "<S> when we compare the likelihood of our standard fit to one where the @xmath108 amplitude fixed to zero we see that the statistical significance of the @xmath108 amplitude is 5.5 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> also we note that the phase difference between the @xmath91 and @xmath108 contributions is consistent with @xmath117 , as expected from cabibbo factors .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider systematic uncertainties that arise from our model of the background , the efficiency , and biases due to experimental resolution . </S>",
    "<S> our general procedure is to change some aspect of our standard fit and interpret the change in the values of the amplitudes and phases as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the background is modeled with a two dimensional cubic polynomial and the covariance matrix of the polynomial coefficents determined from a sideband . </S>",
    "<S> our standard fit fixes the coefficients of the background polynomial , and to estimate the systematic uncertainty on this background shape we perform a fit with the coefficients allowed to float constrained by the covariance matrix . </S>",
    "<S> similarly we perform a fit with a uniform efficiency rather than the efficiency shape determined from the simulation as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to the efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we change selection criteria in the analysis to test whether our simulation properly models the efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> these variations to the standard fit are the largest contribution to our experimental systematic errors . to study the effect of the finite resolution our experiment has on the variables in the dalitz plots we vary the size of the bins used to compute the overall normalization .    </S>",
    "<S> another class of systematic uncertainties arise from our choices for the decay model for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the zemach formalism @xcite , rather than the standard helicity model , which enforces the transversality of intermediate resonances and we vary the radius parameter  @xcite for the intermediate resonances and for the @xmath1 between zero and twice their standard value of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these variations to the standard fit are the largest contribution to our modeling systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we allow the masses and widths for the intermediate resonances to vary within their known errors  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also consider uncertainty arising from which resonances we choose to include in our fit to the dalitz plot . </S>",
    "<S> we compared the result of our standard fit to a series of fits where each of the possible resonances were included one at a time . </S>",
    "<S> we also considered a fit including all possible resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we take the maximum variation of the amplitudes and phases from the standard result compared to the results in this series of fits as a measure of the uncertainty due to our choice of included resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath120 has been reported by e791 in @xmath121 decays  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the @xmath120 are sensitive to the choice of decay model , discussed previously . replacing the non - resonant contribution in our standard fit with a @xmath122 component yields an amplitude of @xmath123 and phase of @xmath124 with a mass of @xmath125 and width @xmath126  mev for the @xmath120 consistent with e791 results  @xcite ( @xmath127 and @xmath128  mev ) . while we find this suggestive that there is a @xmath102 contribution , we are unable to definitively confirm this because of the known shortcomings of our description of the scalar resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic uncertainty does include the difference between the standard fit which does not include the @xmath120 , and the fits allowing it . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we find no evidence for a scalar @xmath129 as also suggested by e791  @xcite in charm decays .    </S>",
    "<S> we also do separate standard fits for @xmath1 and @xmath36 tags to search for @xmath130 violating effects . </S>",
    "<S> we see no statistically significant difference between these two fits . </S>",
    "<S> a more general study would consider a @xmath130 violating amplitude for each component observed in our standard fit . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed the resonant substructure of the decay @xmath80 using the dalitz technique . </S>",
    "<S> we observe ten contributions including a `` wrong sign '' @xmath115 amplitude with a significance of 5.5 standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> this decay arises from a double cabibbo suppressed decay or @xmath5 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath131 , and the relative phase between the two decays to be @xmath132 , consistent with @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath1 and @xmath36 tags separately , and see no @xmath130 violating effects . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependence of the dalitz distribution of this decay mode in our data is able to discern the source of the `` wrong sign '' signal , doubly cabibbo suppressed decays or @xmath5 mixing , and have sensitivity to the mixing parameters @xmath133 , explicitly to its sign , and @xmath134 at the few percent level  @xcite . </S>"
