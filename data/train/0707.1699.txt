    "one of the important recent results from _",
    "chandra , xmm , _ and _ fuse _ is the detection of hot gas at nearly zero redshift .",
    "the low redshift of the gas implies that it is either in the local group or in a halo around the milky way , and discriminating between these two possibilities is critical .",
    "if the gas is extended and fills the local group on the mpc scale , its mass exceeds the baryonic mass in all other galaxies in the local group .",
    "this would account for some of the `` missing baryons '' in the local universe , of fundamental importance for cosmology .",
    "alternatively , if the gas is local to the milky way , within a 100 kpc region , the baryonic mass is two orders of magnitude lower and it would not dominate the local baryon content .",
    "the tracers for this hot gaseous medium are the lines from common ions that occur in the 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 k range , most notably and .",
    "these x - ray lines have been observed in absorption @xcite with both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ , and in emission with a quantum - microcalorimeter spectrograph on a _ shuttle _ payload , dxs @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ion , most common in 10@xmath9 k gas , has been studied in over 100 sightlines with _ fuse _ @xcite .    the location and mass of the hot gas depends strongly on the assumed relationships between the ions . if , , and are cospatial , @xcite can not find a pure collisional model at a single temperature .",
    "however , he can fit his data with a low density medium where photoionization is important , with a temperature of 2.5@xmath210@xmath10 k , a gas density of n@xmath11 @xmath12 6@xmath210@xmath13 @xmath14 , and a pathlength of 3 mpc , corresponding to a gas mass of 1.7@xmath210@xmath15 m@xmath16 .",
    "this gas mass is considerably greater than the mass of all stars and cold gas within this volume , which is about 2@xmath210@xmath17 m@xmath6 and 1.2@xmath210@xmath18 m@xmath6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this `` local group model '' would help explain the missing baryons in the local universe .",
    "alternatively , @xcite assume that only the x - ray lines are cospatial , primarily and , leaving out .",
    "they fix the temperature from the / ratio , and , including the emission observations , find that a collisional ionization model is possible with a length scale of 0.15 - 1 mpc",
    ". their result implies a local group medium with masses of 10@xmath15 m@xmath16 for the 1 mpc length scale , and 10@xmath19 m@xmath16 for the 0.15 mpc length scale , still more gas than the collective ism of local group galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out the sensitivity of this result to temperature and for a somewhat lower permitted temperature , smaller length scales are allowed , typical of a galactic halo ( 50 kpc ) , and leading to considerably reduced gas masses .    in yet another approach",
    ", one might assume that the emission and absorption are from the same gas , with some of the and originating in other material .",
    "the x - ray emission line data was obtained with the inaugural flight of a quantum calorimeter rocket flight by @xcite where they detected individual spectral lines responsible for much of the soft x - ray background , leading to an emission measure and metallicity . with an emission measure ( n@xmath20_l _ ) and an absorption column ( n_l _ ) , the size of the region _",
    "l _ can be obtained and this leads to _ l _ @xmath12 50 kpc @xcite , although this is a lower limit if one allows for filling factors below unity . for filling factors near unity , this solution describes a halo around the galaxy where the gas density is n@xmath11 @xmath21 10@xmath22 @xmath14 and the hot gas mass is @xmath2110@xmath23 - 10@xmath24 m@xmath16 , 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than the solutions of nicastro or rasmussen . in this `` galactic halo ''",
    "solution , the is not cospatial , as argued by @xcite and @xcite , but might arise nearby as the gas cools and recombines or if there is a conductive interface in a hvc",
    ".    the `` local group '' and `` galactic halo '' models represent limiting cases",
    ". the hot gas can not be too small ( e.g. , in the disk ) or it would overproduce the soft x - ray background . also , the absorbing region can not be larger than the virial radius of the local group or the gas would not have a potential well to fall into and become heated . to distinguish between these possibilities , one can search for an angular signature to the absorption line strengths . in particular , for a local group model , the absorption should be more pronounced for sight lines closer to the milky way - m31 axis . for a galactic halo model",
    ", the absorption should be more pronounced for sight lines across the galaxy , compared to those away from the galaxy .",
    "searching for such signatures requires a statistically significant number of sightlines with measured x - ray absorption lines , and for this purpose , the resonance absorption line is the easiest to detect .",
    "there are relatively few _ chandra _ observations of this line toward bright sources , in part because the gratings are not frequently used ( but they have still proven quite useful ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , for _ xmm _ observations , the combination of the spectrograph ( _ rgs _ ) always operating plus the larger collecting area has led to a significant number of viable targets for absorption measurements . here",
    "we present the sample of the brightest agns that have been observed by _",
    "xmm _ and were available through the archive as of april 2006 .",
    "we show that this sample leads to a compelling case for the galactic halo model of x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "we wish to sample a path length as large as the local group , which implies the selection of extragalactic sources , with agns being the most suitable .",
    "the only agns that can be used for x - ray absorption line studies are bright and have been observed for a sufficiently long time .",
    "we constructed a list of the brightest agns from the archival data obtained by _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca_. this is a valuable starting point , but agns are variable , so some sources that were fainter in the past can be brighter now . therefore , using the archive , we inspected the _ xmm - newton rgs _ data for dozens of targets and chose the most suitable objects .",
    "the quantitative goal was to find sources for which the resulting uncertainty in the equivalent width is about 10   or less , since the typical absorption line strength was seen to be about 20   in previous studies .",
    "this led to a sample of 25 agns , plus we also included a source in the lmc , lmc x-3 ( table 1 ) .",
    "many of these sources have been observed multiple times over the lifetime of xmm and so the data can be combined to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "unfortunately ccd 4 in the rgs2 failed shortly after launch and since it covers the wavelength range 20.1@xmath2523.9    only the rgs1 data is useful .",
    "the data was reduced in the usual manner , using the xmm sas software ( version 6.5 ) , and was cleaned using an interative three sigma clipping of a lightcurve from a background region on ccd 9 , to remove periods of high background that would degrade the signal - to - noise .",
    "first order source and background spectra were produced from the cleaned events using the sas task rgsspectrum and response matrices were generated using rgsrmfgen . the rgs1 first order spectra from the observations of each source were background subtracted , and after each spectrum was corrected for the effective area , they were combined to produce a single spectrum for each source .",
    "we note that the instrumental redistribution of photons in channel space is not corrected for .",
    "this is considered below .",
    "to fit absorption lines , we excluded regions of known detector features and regions of intrinsic agn absorption and emission lines . for the resonance line at 21.603  , there is a detector feature at about 21.82    when the data are reduced with the standard sas , so the 21.77 - 21.84   region was excluded in the fits ( blank regions in our figures ) .",
    "many of these bright objects are nearby seyfert galaxies , which have their own lines , some of which occur in absorption and some in emission . in most cases , the lines are sufficiently redshifted that they do not contaminate the local absorption , but they restrict the region redward of 21.6   that can be used to define the baseline .",
    "the redshifted lines are marked on the figures of the spectra when relevant : mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , mkn766 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4051 , ngc 5548 , ngc 3516 , ngc 4593 , and ic4329a ( figures 1 - 6 ) .",
    "in the few cases where there are no useful continuum regions redward of 21.6  , we used a flat continuum to the blue side of the line .",
    "there were objects for which the intrinsic absorption or emission line is badly blended with the galactic absorption line , such as ngc 4151 .",
    "although it is suitably bright , it has a broad resonance emission line that overlaps with the z = 0 feature . the local absorption line , although present , lies in the sharply rising wing of the ngc 4151 emission line , so the equivalent width of the absorption feature can not be measured reliably .",
    "ngc 4151 , and other similar objects were not included in the sample .",
    "when there are no intrinsic agn features near 21.6  , we fit a linear continuum in the range 21.2 - 21.96  , the upper limit being set by the need to avoid galactic k@xmath0 absorption at 22.05   @xcite .",
    "in addition to the continuum , we fit a gaussian absorption line for the galactic absorption feature .",
    "the least - squares minimization has been performed by both the simplex method and using a levenberg - marquardt minimization and we arrive at the same result . in practice , there are five parameters in this model : the continuum level ; the slope of the continuum ; the central wavelength of the absorption line ; the gaussian @xmath26 of the absorption line ; and the area of the line ( the line depth ) , which can be negative or positive ( absorption and emission are permitted ) .",
    "certain constraints can be applied to some of these parameters .",
    "for example , the gaussian fit can not be narrower than the instrumental width ( @xmath26 = 0.03  or fwhm = 0.06  ) and it probably will not be wider than a velocity corresponding to the escape velocity of the local group , which we estimate to be about 700 km s@xmath27 , or @xmath26 = 0.05  . similarly , the location of the line center should not be outside of sensible local group velocities , which sets a displacment of about 500 km s@xmath27 , or 0.036  . in carrying out our fits ,",
    "we calculate an uncertainty for each parameter . only in a few cases",
    "are the uncertainties for the line center and line width smaller than the allowed range , and for the five highest s / n sources , mkn 421 , pks 2155 - 304 , 3c273 ,",
    "mcg-3 - 30 - 15 , and lmc x-3 , the median values of the central wavelength and line width are 21.605  and @xmath26 = 0.081  , with small ranges .",
    "consequently , for fainter sources where the central wavelength and line width can not be accurately determined , we fix the central wavelength at 21.603   and the line width at @xmath26 = 0.08  .",
    "when we relax these constraints , the values for the equivalent widths do not vary greatly , although the uncertainty will naturally be larger .",
    "we note that the uncertainty determined from photon counting statistics for the bins of the combined spectra appear to overestimate the true rms since the least square fits have a @xmath28@xmath20 that is too small ( one can verify this by inspection in that a fit goes through nearly every error bar ) . to achieve a typical @xmath28@xmath20 for an acceptable fit",
    ", we estimate that the uncertainty per point would need to be reduced by 25 - 80% , depending on the object .",
    "this is due to a misalignment between the raw channels and the flux binning , introduced in the creation of the combined spectra , resulting in a lack of independence between adjacent flux bins . to verify that neither the non - independence of the flux bins nor the lack of treatment of the instrumental redistribution are significantly affecting our results ,",
    "we have simultaineously fitted the individual spectra in xspec for some test cases .    upon examining the spectra",
    ", there were no absorption features that deviated from expectations , with the exception of ngc 7469 , where there is a possible absorption feature at -900 km s@xmath29 ( 98% confidence ) , a velocity shift is much greater than the instrumental uncertainty .",
    "however , with 26 objects , there is a near - unity chance of finding one such feature over a range of @xmath30 1000 km s@xmath29 , so we do not consider this a real detection .",
    "the resulting line strengths and statistical uncertainties are given in table 2 and the spectra are given in figures 1 - 6 .",
    "the objects are ordered by decending values of their continuum s / n , which is a figure of merit for the quality to which uncertainties on the equivalent widths can be obtained . of the 26 objects , 10 have detections above a 3@xmath26 threshold , six are at the 2 - 3@xmath26 level and the remainder are below 2@xmath26 . even non - detections are important ,",
    "provided that the uncertainties are adequately small . for this sample ,",
    "18 objects have uncertainties to the equivalent widths of 10   or less , and this forms the most useful subset of our data .",
    "there happens to be a decrease in quality of the spectra after object 18 , but we also have used the remaining objects in some tests ( although as those tests are weighted by the errors , these last eight objects do not have a large influence on the results ) .    a few sources were observed with both _",
    "xmm _ and _ chandra _ , and in nearly every case , the _ xmm _ data is of higher s / n .",
    "the exception is the source lmc x-3 , where the _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ data @xcite",
    "are of comparable s / n and their equivalent widths are nearly identical .",
    "the line strengths measured by others for the _ xmm _ data give very similar results ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the differences being consistent with different fitting methods .",
    "other approaches to fitting the same data ( e.g. , within xspec or iraf ) yielded nearly identical results .",
    "there are other , weaker absorption lines present , although there are not enough of them to form a useful set for angular studies .",
    "the most relevant is the k@xmath0 line , which can be used with the k@xmath0 line to constrain the temperature .",
    "the only useful objects are mkn 421 , pks 2155 - 304 , and 3c273 , reported on by @xcite , so we use their results for the to line ratios .",
    "the primary goal is to determine whether the absorption lines have an angular signature that correlates with either the local group structure , or various milky way properties . given the limits of the data , it is impractical to fit multi - parameter models to the data , so we choose simple representative models , although we have explored a wide range of models .",
    "we begin with the model for the local group , and as there are no widely accepted models for the distribution of diffuse hot gas , here we assume that the diffuse baryons are aligned along the axis defined by the milky way and m31 , which are the two dominant mass components of the local group .",
    "if the center of mass of the diffuse baryons lies halfway between m31 and the milky way , then the greatest column density should occur in a sightline toward m31 and the smallest column would occur in the anti - m31 direction .",
    "consequently , a general test is whether the column density decreases with increasing angle from m31 .",
    "this prediction is not confirmed by the data ( figure 7 ) , where the equivalent widths weakly increase with increasing angle from m31 , rather than decrease .    with a more detailed model",
    ", one can predict the expected distribution of the column densities for comparison to the data .",
    "the specific model that we adopt is where m31 and the milky way lie at the two foci of an ellipsoid in which the gas density is uniform .",
    "the model is completely defined by choosing a semi - major axis , and we show the results for a model where the semi - major axis is twice the separation between m31 and the milky way ( semi - major axis of 1.54 mpc ) .",
    "the normalization of the column density of the model is a remaining parameter , which we choose to minimize the @xmath28@xmath20 .",
    "inspection of the model fit ( figure 8) indicates it is a poor fit , and as the reduced @xmath28@xmath20 = 5.5 , it is an unacceptable fit . for semi - major axis from 0.8 - 2 mpc ,",
    "all models produce unacceptable fits with no positive correlation coefficients , showing that it is unlikely that the -absorbing gas is distributed through the local group .",
    "we have also compared the location of the absorbers with the individual local group galaxies to determine if they have a specific signature .",
    "for example , if individual galaxies were to have their own extended gaseous halos , there would be stronger absorption lines for sight lines near those galaxies ( figure 9 ) . if galaxy gaseous halos scale with galaxy size , then the largest external galaxy halo should be around m31 , where the closest sightline is akn 564 , 29@xmath31 away , or a closest approach of 380 kpc .",
    "the equivalent width in this sight line ( 12.3 @xmath30 4.6 m ) appears to be less and is certainly not substantially greater than the median equivalent width .",
    "this implies that if m31 has a significant gaseous halo , it is less than 380 kpc in radius .",
    "the next largest galaxy with a nearby sightline is m33 , where 3c 59 is 9@xmath31 away , or a 130 kpc impact parameter .",
    "the equivalent width , 60.9 @xmath30 19.2 m , has a rather large uncertainty , so it is difficult determining whether there a hot halo exists around m33 .",
    "two dwarf galaxies have nearby sightlines : ddo 210 , where mrk 509 is 3@xmath31 away ( 42 kpc ) ; and leo i & ii , where ton 1388 is 3.5@xmath31 away ( 14 kpc ) .",
    "the equivalent width for ton 1388 is above average but fairly uncertain , 34.5 @xmath30 15.7 m , and is within 1@xmath26 of the median value for the sample . for mrk 509 ,",
    "the detection is quite good ( 25.9 @xmath30 7.3 m ) and it also is within 1@xmath26 of the median value .",
    "so for leo i & ii , there appears to not be a gaseous halo either , although this dwarf pair does not have hi nor does it have star formation @xcite .",
    "the observations , which are only of high quality for m31 and leo i & ii , argue against substantial halos with a size an order of magnitude larger than the optical galaxy .",
    "the data do not rule out smaller galactic halo that are comparable or a few times larger than the host galaxy .",
    "there is one useful source within the lmc , lmc x-3 and it lies in the disk , 6.9 @xmath32 ( 6.7 kpc ) from the center of the lmc . if a lmc halo surrounds the galaxy , this sightline would sample half of the lmc halo plus the intervening gas between it and the sun .",
    "the source lmc x-3 has an equivalent width that is very close to the median value ( 21.0 @xmath30 5.0 m ) and the line width is no wider than average ( 0.063 @xmath30 0.012  ) , so there is no indication of additional absorption toward this source caused by a lmc halo .",
    "finally , the line center ( 21.592 @xmath30 0.016  ) is consistent with the velocity of the milky way , but 2@xmath26 lower in redshift than the lmc , which would have produced a line at 21.623  .",
    "this is similar to the conclusions of @xcite , who used _",
    "chandra _ data to observe lmc x-3 .",
    "another model that we consider is for a hot galactic halo , where the simplest assumption is that a hot gas halo is centered on the galaxy center . in this picture , the column density of hot gas should be a decreasing function of angle away from the galactic center , and as shown in figure 10 , there appears to be the expected inverse correlation .",
    "an unweighted linear y - on - x fit shows that there is an inverse correlation with angle at the 95% confidence level , supporting the galaxy halo model . to be more quantitative , yet to keep the model simple ,",
    "we calculate relative column densities for a uniform sphere of radius r@xmath33 , which is the only free parameter ( the equivalent width is constrained to be zero for zero path length ) ; we use 8.5 kpc as the distance of the sun from the center of the galaxy .",
    "a fit of similar significance is found ( figure 11 ) , where a best - fit @xmath28@xmath20 model leads to r@xmath33 = 20.6 kpc , and the 95% confidence bounds are 15 - 110 kpc .",
    "for the best - fit model , the @xmath28@xmath20 is unacceptably large , which can occur if the statistical uncertainty in the equivalent widths are smaller than the variation due to structure in the absorbing medium . to obtain an acceptable value of @xmath28@xmath20",
    ", we added an intrinsic scatter in the equivalent widths attributable to the structure of the absorbing gas of 4 m , or 23% of the median value of the equivalent width .",
    "the above model represents a spherical halo where the density _",
    "n _ @xmath34 _ r@xmath35 _ , but we can also consider models where the density is a decreasing function of radius , such as _ n _",
    "@xmath34 @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the core radius . the value of @xmath37 in most other galaxies with hot gas is less than 1 kpc , which is significantly smaller than the radius of closest approach for all objects in the sample . therefore , the value of @xmath37 is not relevant for our sample and we can write the density function as a power - law , _",
    "@xmath34 @xmath38 , and we choose to examine",
    "@xmath34 @xmath39 , as this is similar to that found for the hot gas in ellipticals ( @xmath40=1/2 in the `` beta '' models used for ellipticals , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while this leads to a gas mass that increases with radius as r@xmath41 and an emission measure that increases logarithmically with radius , the column density is convergent at large radius .",
    "there is only a modest correlation between the theoretical and observed equivalent widths , significant at the 92% confidence level ( figure 12 ) .",
    "this model is closely associated with the galaxy as well . from the available data",
    ", we can not distinguish between the uniform model and this `` beta '' model .",
    "more complicated models can certainly be constructed , but given the quality of the data , we do not believe it is warranted at this time .",
    "if this absorption is associated with a galactic halo , it might be correlated with the soft x - ray background of the galaxy .",
    "the 1/4 kev x - ray background is dominated by the gas within a few hundred pc of the sun , plus a flattened hot halo of height 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "this is not the x - ray emission that we expect the absorption features to be related to and there is no correlation between the 1/4 kev surface brightness and the equivalent widths . at higher energies , such as the 3/4 kev band , the emission is a mixture of emission from hot galactic gas plus emission from unresolved agns @xcite .",
    "also , the absorption of the x - rays by neutral galactic gas is less of a problem at these energies .",
    "it is probably the best energy at which to detect diffuse galactic emission and it has been known that there is enhanced soft x - ray emission in the general direction of the bulge @xcite .",
    "a correlation exists between r45 and the equivalent width at the 99% confidence level ( weighted or unweighted fit ) , without requiring that the fit go through the origin ( figure 13 ) . this relationship is better than the correlation found with angle from the galactic center or with either of the above galactic halo models . for this fit ,",
    "the @xmath28@xmath20 = 45 ( 16 dof ) , which is unacceptable at the 99% confidence level , so we added a additional rms in the equivalent width , as described above .",
    "for an additional rms of 3.5 m  ( 19% of the median equivalent width ) , the @xmath28@xmath20 is reduced to an acceptable 28.5 and the probability of a weighted fit is reduced to the 98% confidence level .",
    "the high initial @xmath28@xmath20 is due to one low point and if this outlier were removed , the quality of the fit would improve . by using the entire sample and creating error - weighted bins ( figure 14 )",
    ", we obtain a similar level of significance , although a somewhat lower additional rms is required in this case ( 3.0 m ) to obtain acceptable values of @xmath28@xmath20 .",
    "the r45 band emission contains not only large - scale galactic emission , but individual bright features due to multiple supernovae , such as the north polar spur .",
    "we examined the location of the objects to determine if they lie in bright regions of these features , but there are hardly any coincidences .",
    "the quasar 3c273 is located near a fainter part of the north polar spur , but it s equivalent width is not remarkable ( 24.6 @xmath30 3.3 m ) .",
    "the strongest component of the r45 emission is the emission triplet , so the relationship between the r45 emission and the absorption equivalent widths suggests a correlation between the emission and absorption .",
    "this implies that the emission and absorption is largely cospatial .",
    "another piece of evidence for the galactic halo picture is the mean redshift of our four highest s / n agns .",
    "there is a random uncertainty in the wavelength calibration of 0.008 (xmm - newton users s handbook ) , or 111 km s@xmath27 , so it is helpful to average together several objects .",
    "using these four agns , the unweighted mean central wavelength is 21.608 (+70 km s@xmath27 ) , and the inferred standard deviation of a single point is 0.006  , but to be conservative , we assume that it is 0.010  , as this is the median value for the uncertainty in the central wavelength from individual fits . then , the uncertainty in the mean central wavelength is 0.005 (55 km s@xmath27 ) , which places this mean about 1@xmath26 of the milky way ( z = 0 , or 21.603  ) . the local group is probably at -250 km s@xmath27 , a wavelength of 21.585  , 4.6@xmath26 different from the measured mean value .",
    "this suggests that the absorption is most likely associated with the milky way and not the local group .",
    "the conversion of the equivalent width to a hydrogen density , which will yield a length scale as well , requires knowledge of the oxygen column density , the oxygen abundance , and the fraction of oxygen in the form of .",
    "when the optical depth of the absorption line is low , there is a simple linear relationship between the equivalent width and the column density , n ( ) = 3.48@xmath210@xmath42 ew , where the equivalent width ( ew ) has units of m  and the column density , n ( ) has units of @xmath43 . if the lines are resolved or if the gaseous medium is turbulent at the sound speed , then the optical depth is small , but if the lines have a doppler width for oxygen ( no turbulent or significant ordered motion ) , the optical depth at the line center can be 0.1 - 0.4 . as the optical depth rises",
    ", the higher order lines , such as k@xmath40 , become of equal strength to the k@xmath0 line .",
    "we examined the strength of the k@xmath40 for the highest s / n spectrum , of mkn 421 , and find a value of 3.6 @xmath30 1.1 m , although an instrumental feature contaminates the red side of the line .",
    "the k@xmath40 to k@xmath0 ratio is 0.30 @xmath30 0.11 , which is within 1@xmath26 of the ratio of the f values , 0.21 .",
    "this is consistent either with a small or modest optical depth . here",
    "we will calculate column densities in the limit of low optical depth .",
    "the ionization fraction can be determined by forming the ratio of with an adjacent ionization state , such as or , provided that the different ionization states are cospatial . the relationship between and is poor and both @xcite and @xcite argue that the two are probably not closely related .",
    "it is tempting to relate to , and a correlation between these two quantities would lend support to this possibility .",
    "unfortunately , there are only a few objects for which we can determine useful measurements of absorption , the errors are significant , and there is no statistically meaningful correlation between the two quantities @xcite .",
    "it is possible to have a multi - temperature medium where the hotter component leads to while a slightly cooler component dominates the . as the above study showed that emission and absorption are correlated , we will use these two measurements to obtain densities and length scales , later considering whether it is consistent with the to column density ratio .    for a galactic halo model",
    ", we expect the metallicity to be similar to the value in the ism and the sun . for oxygen ,",
    "the `` solar '' abundance has changed considerably in the past two decades and is still not a settled issue .",
    "the most commonly cited solar abundances come from @xcite , where log_n@xmath44 _ = 8.93 , but @xcite recommends a value of 8.736 , a 35% reduction from the older value .",

    "a value smaller than 5 kpc is ruled out because it would have the consequence of raising the emission measure above the observed value .",
    "the to column density ratio is consistent with a gas whose temperature is logt = 6.2 - 6.3 .",
    "this column density ratio changes rapidly in this temperature range , so even a modest amount of temperature variation along the line of sight ( e.g. , 20 - 30% ) can make a difference in this ratio by a factor of several , as @xcite points out .",
    "the analysis of the emission in the r45 band indicates a temperature of logt = 6.0 - 6.1 @xcite , so the absorption may also be occurring in a temperature a bit too low to produce the absorption as well . temperature variation at this level",
    "is seen in some early - type galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 4636 ; @xcite ) , and if a positive temperature gradient is present in the milky way halo , there could be radial regions where is dominant and more distant regions where is dominant .",
    "a radial decomposition of the to ionization fraction ratio is possible in principle , but the present data are inadequate for such work .",
    "we sought to determine whether the x - ray absorption , primarily in the resonance line , were due to a local group medium or a hot galactic halo .",
    "it is possible to address this question by searching for the spatial signature of these two models , which are distinct .",
    "the local group is expected to be elongated along the axis defined by the milky way and m31 . for our model , where the two galaxies are placed at the foci of an ellipsoid of rotation about the mw - m31 axis , the greatest column would result toward m31 and the smallest in the opposite direction .",
    "for the milky way halo model where the halo is comparable to the size of the galaxy , the greatest columns would occur when looking across the galaxy , in the general direction of the bulge . by good fortune , these two models are nearly orthogonal in that the minimum direction for the local group model , the anti - m31 direction , is at _ l , b _ = 301@xmath31 , 21.6@xmath31 , where the galactic halo model would predict an excess compared to the mean sightline .",
    "the comparison between the absorption line data and the models shows that the galactic halo model is preferred .",
    "the data do not permit us to accurately determine the properties of the halo so we adopted the simplest possible model , a uniform spherical halo . in the context of this model ,",
    "the characteristic radial size lies in the range 15 - 100 kpc .",
    "the redshift of the lines is consistent with a galactic origin rather than a local group origin .",
    "the absorption line data correlates best with the r45 ( 0.4 - 1 kev ) emission , for which the biggest contribution is the emission triplet .",
    "this suggests that the emission and absorption are cospatial to some degree , and for a cospatial model , we derive an independent measure of the size of the halo , which is about 20 kpc . constraints on the temperature may be provided by using the absorption as well , which leads to a temperature of logt = 6.1 , as discussed previously @xcite .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the work of @xcite , who also argue for a galactic origin based on _ chandra _ obervations and on the absence of x - ray absorption by other groups .    as an example of a possible halo ,",
    "when we consider a uniform galaxy halo of radius 20 kpc , the mass for the hot gas is about 4 @xmath210@xmath5 m@xmath6 , which is considerable , but only a small fraction of the gaseous content of the galaxy , and orders of magnitude less than the values suggested for the local group models @xcite .",
    "this amount of mass is similar to that found in the less x - ray luminous early - type galaxies , and it is comparable to the amount of mass suggested to be present due to galactic fountain models @xcite .",
    "also , this mass is much less than the external baryon mass predicted by in some n - body / gasdynamical simulations @xcite , which is expected to be comparable to the baryonic mass of the disk plus bulge stars and the gas in the galaxy ( 5 @xmath2 10@xmath24 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "while we have assumed a solar - like metallicity , we note that the oxygen abundance can not be significantly lower , as it would lead to a higher electron column density that would exceed the values determined from the dispersion measure toward pulsars . at the pole",
    ", the pulsar dispersion measure implies an electron column of 5.1 @xmath2 10@xmath45 @xmath43 @xcite , comparable to the column inferred from the .",
    "already , there is hardly room for the contribution from the 10@xmath54 k gas that is known to exist around the disk @xcite , so any decrease in the oxygen abundance or the fraction can be excluded .",
    "the constraint provided by the pulsar dispersion measure argues for near - solar abundances and an ionization near unity .",
    "a weak limit on the size of hot halos around other galaxies is provided by the failure to find enhanced absorption toward m31 , where the sightline of the nearest object passes 380 kpc from its center .",
    "also , there was no substantial enhancement in the ( or ) absorption toward lmc x-3 , which suggests that there is not a significant 10@xmath7 k halo around the lmc .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who showed that the redshift of the line center , as determined with _",
    "chandra _ , is inconsistent with an lmc origin and consistent with a galactic origin .",
    "a cooler ionized halo is known to exist around the lmc , which is responsible for the enhanced dispersion measure toward pulsars @xcite .",
    "this study does not rule out some component of the emission lying in a local group medium .",
    "certainly , the local group is not devoid of gas , so it must have some as well .",
    "however , as @xcite discuss , if galaxy groups commonly had a significant column , it would be detected in sight lines toward background agns at a rate in conflict with existing limits .",
    "there is more work that can be carried out with _ xmm _ data , as new observations are improving the s / n for some agns and additional agns are being observed for significant amounts of time . however , _",
    "xmm _ and _ chandra _ will not be able to provide us with @xmath21 10@xmath20 sight lines with high s / n line measurements , which would be needed to map out the structure of the hot halo , much in the same way as has been accomplished for lower temperature gas with _ iue _",
