    "the nine out of ten known agn that are radio - quiet closely resemble the 10% that are radio - loud . , where @xmath3 ( kellerman et al . 1989 ) . ]",
    "the physical origin of this radio - loudness dichotomy remains a mystery .",
    "for this reason , the apparent connection between black hole mass and radio loudness , reported first by franceschini , vercellone & fabian ( 1998 ) and apparently confirmed in subsequent studies ( mclure et al .",
    "1999 , lacy et al .",
    "2001 , nagar et al .",
    "2002 , jarvis & mclure 2002 ) is potentially very exciting .",
    "however , other studies found less compelling evidence for a tight connection ( ho 2002 ) , and revealed a population of radio - loud agn with quite modest black hole masses ( as low as @xmath4 ; oshlack , webster & whiting 2002 ) .",
    "there was still an apparent threshold effect , wherein nearly all high - mass black holes ( @xmath5 ) are hosted by radio - loud agn ( laor 2000 ) .    in the largest compilation of agn black hole masses to date",
    ", nearly 400 agn , including 157 agn for which radio loudness was measured , woo & urry ( 2002 ; hereafter paper  i ) could not rule out such a threshold effect because no agn with @xmath6 was radio - quiet .",
    "in contrast , other trends with black hole mass that were previously reported  such as @xmath7 increasing with @xmath8  disappeared in this larger agn sample ; apparently sample selection effects in earlier , smaller studies created spurious trends . but the absence of high - mass radio - quiet agn remained .    woo and urry suspected this could be a selection effect , particularly because the redshifts of agn with @xmath6 were considerably higher than those with lower black hole masses , and",
    "were from differently selected , not directly comparable samples .",
    "however , the available data were insufficient to evaluate this concern .    in the present paper ,",
    "we ask the simple question , are there radio - quiet agn with @xmath6 ?",
    "we look in particular at higher luminosity radio - quiet agn , at higher redshifts than those in paper  i , comparable to the redshifts of the radio - loud agn with high @xmath8 . in section 2 , we describe the three samples of radio - quiet agn . in section 3",
    "we present the black hole masses and radio loudnesses for a total of 452 agn , nearly tripling the previous sample .",
    "section 4 gives our conclusions .",
    "most black hole mass estimates in the literature are derived from optical or uv luminosity , using the correlation between size of the broad - emission - line region and luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , mclure & jarvis 2002 , vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "we use this method , combining luminosity with broad emission line width .",
    "therefore , the search for high - mass black holes in agn corresponds to a search for high - luminosity agn with measured line widths .",
    "three large quasar samples , described below , are useful for our purpose .",
    "this collection of different samples is not useful for inferring the intrinsic distribution of @xmath8 , since the selection criteria vary from one sample to the next , but it is sufficient to determine whether high-@xmath8 exist in radio - quiet agn , at redshifts comparable to those of the high-@xmath8 in radio - loud agn .",
    "the bright quasar survey ( bqs ) sample is a subset of the pg quasar sample ( schimidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "boroson & green ( 1992 ) present detailed emission - line properties for the 87 low - redshift sources ( @xmath9 ) of the 114 bqs agn , and other characteristics of the low - redshift bqs , including continum energy distributions ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 ) and radio properties ( kellerman et al . 1989 ) , are also in the literature .    for the 87 agn in the boroson & green ( bg ) sample , we collected or made black hole mass estimates .",
    "seventeen are known from reverberation mapping ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , at present the most accurate method for estimating black hole mass , so these we simply adopted .",
    "for the remaining 70 agn , we use optical luminosity and @xmath10 line width assuming the broad line region is virialized by the central black hole ( eqn .  3 of paper  i ) , correcting the published luminosity as needed according to our adopted cosmology ( @xmath11  km / s / mpc , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "we note that 7 of these were previously estimated by mclure & dunlop ( 2001 ) but with a different cosmology ; laor ( 2000 ) plotted all 87 in his fig .  2 but did not tabulate the masses ; and 24 were previously published in our paper  i.    the estimated black hole masses of the 70 radio - quiet agn range from roughly @xmath14 to @xmath0 @xmath1 , with a few larger than @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "figure  1 plots radio loudness for this sample , also taken from boroson & green ( 1992 ) , versus black hole mass .",
    "if the black hole mass function is steep , the volume represented by the low redshift range of this sample ( @xmath15 ) may be too small to contain many large black holes ; nonetheless , it is clear there do exist radio - quiet agn with @xmath16  @xmath1 .      to find the possibly rare high - mass black holes , we looked for a higher - redshift sample of radio - quiet agn for which sufficient data exist to estimate black hole masses .",
    "the h - band spectroscopic study by mcintosh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) of 31 high - redshift agn ( @xmath17 ) , 17 radio - quiet and 14 radio - loud , includes rest - frame @xmath10 line widths and rest - frame v - band luminosities .",
    "we used the same method ( optical luminosity and @xmath10 line fwhm ) to estimate black hole mass , after correcting the luminosities to our cosmology .",
    "black hole masses range from a few to ten billion @xmath1 .",
    "all radio - quiet agn in this sample have @xmath6 .      our previous study",
    "( paper  i ) found no radio - quiet agn with black hole mass larger than @xmath0 @xmath1 ; however , most of the larger black hole masses in that paper were for ( radio - loud ) agn in the redshift range @xmath18 , compared to a lower redshift range , @xmath15 , for the radio - quiet agn . to eliminate this possible selection effect",
    ", we here look specifically for radio - quiet agn at @xmath19 .",
    "the large bright quasars survey ( lbqs ) contains 1058 optically - selected agn at redshifts @xmath20 ( hewett , foltz & chaffee 1995 ) .",
    "emission line properties for the lbqs are published in forster et al .",
    "since the @xmath10 line is not available for the most agn in the redshift range of interest , we instead use the mgii line .",
    "mclure and jarvis ( 2002 ) showed there is a correlation between the reverberation - mapped size of the mg  ii - emitting region and the uv luminosity ( at 3000  ) ; we re - derived this relation for our cosmology .",
    "assuming isotropic orbits , we have :    @xmath21    uv luminosities for the 251 lbqs agn at @xmath19 were calculated from the spectral indices and measured fluxes reported by forster et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    to obtain radio luminosities , we searched the faint imaging radio source ( first ) survey , which covers roughly a half of the lbqs area ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "two - hundred one out of the 251 agn at @xmath18 are covered by first survey ; 16 are first radio sources ( hewett , foltz & chaffee 2001 ) . since the other 185 agn are not detected , we derived radio upper limits at 5  ghz by converting the 1  mjy flux limit at 1.4  ghz using a spectral index @xmath22 .",
    "optical luminosities were calculated from the spectral indices and measured fluxes reported by forster et al .",
    "in figure 1 , we present new black hole masses and radio loudnesses ( or upper limits ) for 295 agn , and combine them with the 157 agn discussed previously in paper  i. just as there are radio - loud agn with small black hole masses , there are clearly radio - quiet agn with large black hole masses . for @xmath23 , there is no statistically significant difference between the distributions of black hole mass for radio - loud and radio - quiet agn ( with 96% probability that the distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution , according to a ks test ) .",
    "this is actually surprising since , given the heterogeneity of the overall sample , there is no reason to expect the _",
    "distributions _ of black hole mass in radio - loud and radio - quiet agn to agree .",
    "it indicates more similarity than we have a right to expect .",
    "the radio - loud agn were selected primarily at radio - wavelengths , while the radio - quiet agn come from optical surveys , so the flux limits and the volume sampled are quite different .",
    "( sizeable collections of optically - selected radio - loud agn will be possible with large surveys such as the sloan survey , but have not previously been available because of limited sample size . )",
    "if black hole mass is independent of radio loudness , then however heterogeneous the sample selection , it must be the case ( as long as redshift ranges are similar ) that the black hole masses of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn span the same range .",
    "indeed , for radio - quiet and radio - loud agn with @xmath6 , the redshift ranges are quite similar ( although the actual distributions do differ at the 99% confidence level according to a ks test , reflecting the different selection biases ) .",
    "thus the volume and epoch sampled for the new radio - quiet agn are similar to that of the high-@xmath8 radio - loud agn discussed in paper  i. once this condition of compatibility is satisfied , the difference in black hole mass  i.e. , the apparent lack of high-@xmath8 among the radio - quiet agn  goes away , and the distributions of black hole mass above @xmath24 are consistent with being the same , independent of radio loudness .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence that radio loudness depends on black hole mass . there does not appear to be any correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath8 , nor is there a threshold such that large black hole masses , @xmath6 , are preferentially radio - loud .",
    "the origin of radio loudness remains a mystery .",
