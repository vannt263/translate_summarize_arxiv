    "the broad incoherent spectral weight and its shift to higher energy between the edge and the center of the bz are recognized as universal features for the parameters favoring zigzag magnetic order .",

    "this makes the observations made in the letter robust features of the presented models i and ii . we have found : ( i ) the incoherent distribution of the spectral weight , ( ii ) large spectral weight at high energy , and ( iii ) the absence of low energy qps from the arpes spectra because of destructive interference , even though qp eigenstates exist in the low - energy spectrum .",
    "this could explain pseudogap - type behavior in these materials .",
    "these results suggest that the qualitative agreement with the recently reported experimental angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) spectra @xcite is generic , and thus bring new insights into spectral properties of such a strong spin - orbit - coupled mott insulator .",

    "<S> we suggest that the ed @xcite simulates here the main features of the arpes spectra measured at @xmath120 k @xcite  although the nel temperature @xmath121  k is much smaller due to frustration , the incoherent part of the spectra should be only weakly affected by thermal fluctuations for @xmath122 . </S>",

    "<S> the basic features of the arpes spectra , ( i )  the strong incoherence and ( ii )  the shift of the spectral weight to high energies at the @xmath104 and @xmath18 points , are dictated by the zigzag correlations and are similar in the two models . yet </S>",
