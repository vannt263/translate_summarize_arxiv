    "it has recently been discussed that the holes in the high-@xmath18 cuprates self - organize into quasi - one - dimensional stripes.@xcite the stripe phase is a periodic distribution of antiferromagnetically - ordered spin regions separated by quasi - one - dimensional charged domain walls which act as magnetic antiphase boundaries .",
    "although the relation between the stripe correlations and the mechanism of high-@xmath18 superconductivity is not fully understood yet , it has become clear @xcite that the charge stripes determine the charge transport behavior , at least in the lightly hole doped region : charges can move more easily along the stripes than across the stripes.@xcite given that the stripes indeed affect the basic physical properties such as charge transport , it is desirable to build a comprehensive picture of the roles of stripes in the cuprates .",
    "since the nonuniform charge distribution is expected to induce variations of the local crystal structure,@xcite which disturb phonons , the phonon heat transport is expected to be a good tool capable of detecting the influence of stripes even in the charge - localized region .",
    "thermal conductivity is one of the basic transport properties that provides a wealth of useful information on the charge carriers and phonons , as well as their scattering processes .",
    "it is known that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulating compound la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 shows predominant phonon transport at low temperatures , which is manifested in a large phonon peak at 20  25 k in the temperature dependence of both @xmath0-plane and @xmath1-axis thermal conductivities ( @xmath2 and @xmath3);@xcite such phonon peak disappears in sr - doped la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( lsco ) with @xmath10 = 0.10  0.20.@xcite the suppression of the phonon peak is normally caused by the defect scattering and the electron scattering of phonons in doped single crystals ; however , it is also known that the phonon peak re - appears in both @xmath17 and @xmath19 of overdoped la@xmath20sr@xmath21cuo@xmath6,@xcite which can not be explained in this scenario .",
    "furthermore , it was found that in rare earth ( re ) and sr co - doped la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 , such as la@xmath12nd@xmath13sr@xmath14cuo@xmath6 , the phonon thermal conductivity is much more enhanced in the non - superconducting ltt ( low - temperature tetragonal ) phase , compared to that in lsco with the same sr content.@xcite this can not happen if the defect scattering and electron scattering of phonons are the only source of the peak suppression .",
    "based on the fact that in re- and sr - doped la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 systems the phononic thermal conductivity is always strongly suppressed in superconducting samples,@xcite it was proposed that dynamical stripes cause a pronounced damping of phonon heat transport , while static stripes do not suppress the phonon transport so significantly.@xcite it is indeed possible that the static stripes are not effective in scattering phonons , if they only induce _ periodic _ local distortions in the crystal structure . since the spin stripes in lightly doped lsco ( @xmath10 = 0.01  0.05 ) are reported to be static,@xcite one may naively expect that the phonon heat transport is not strongly suppressed in such lightly doped lsco .",
    "however , there has been no measurement of the thermal conductivity of lightly doped lsco single crystals .        in this paper",
    ", we report our study of the thermal conductivity of lightly doped la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6",
    "( @xmath10 = 0  0.04 ) single crystals .",
    "such low doping levels are intentionally selected for the reasons of both tracing the evolution of the phonon peak and avoiding significant modifications of the crystal structure and phonon mode , which may complicate interpretations of the data .",
    "it is found that the phonon peak is suppressed significantly even with very small doping concentration , especially for the @xmath1-axis heat transport .",
    "since this result is contrary to the naive expectation mentioned in the previous paragraph , we also study the thermal conductivity of la@xmath7cu@xmath8zn@xmath9o@xmath6 ( lczo ) ( @xmath11 = 0  0.04 ) single crystals , which have similar amount of dopants as lsco .",
    "the important difference between these two systems is that there can not be stripes in lczo ( since there is no carrier ) , while there are static spin stripes in lsco at low temperatures . by comparing the thermal conductivity behaviors in these two systems",
    ", we can elucidate whether the static stripes are responsible for strong scattering of phonons .",
    "the comparison indicate that the stripes , though they are static , indeed damp the @xmath1-axis phonon transport significantly , while their role is minor in the in - plane phonon transport .",
    "the single crystals of lsco and lczo are grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone ( tsfz ) technique and carefully annealed in flowing pure he gas to remove the excess oxygen.@xcite after the crystallographic axes are determined by using the x - ray laue analysis , the crystals are cut into rectangular thin platelets with the typical sizes of @xmath22 mm@xmath23 , where the @xmath1 axis is perpendicular or parallel to the platelet with an accuracy of 1@xmath24 .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath25 is measured in the temperature range of 2  300 k using a steady - state technique;@xcite above 150 k , a double thermal shielding is employed to minimize the heat loss due to radiation , and the residual radiation loss is corrected for by using an elaborate measurement configuration . the temperature difference @xmath26@xmath27 in the sample is measured by a differential chromel - constantan thermocouple , which is glued to the sample using ge vanish .",
    "the @xmath26@xmath27 varies between 0.5% and 2% of the sample temperature . to improve the accuracy of the measurement at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath25 is also measured with  one heater , two thermometer \" method from 2 to 20 k by using a chip heater and two cernox chip sensors.@xcite the errors in the thermal conductivity data are smaller than 10% , which is mainly caused by the uncertainties in the geometrical factors .",
    "magnetization measurements are carried out using a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "it is useful to first establish an understanding of the anisotropic heat transport in undoped crystals .",
    "the temperature dependences of the thermal conductivity measured along the @xmath0 plane and the @xmath1 axis in pure la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "1 , which also contains data for lsco and lczo single crystals . for undoped la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 sample",
    ", a sharp peak appears at low temperature , at @xmath2825 k in @xmath17 and at @xmath2820 k in @xmath19 , respectively . in the @xmath1 direction , above the peak temperature",
    ", @xmath3 decreases with increasing @xmath27 approximately following @xmath29 dependence , which is typical for phonon heat transport.@xcite this phonon peak originates from the competition between the increase in the population of phonons and the decrease in their mean free path ( due to the phonon - phonon umklapp scattering ) with increasing temperature .",
    "in contrast to the mainly phononic heat transport in the @xmath1 direction , in the @xmath0 plane another large and broad peak develops at higher temperature ( @xmath28270 k ) , which has been attributed @xcite to the magnon transport in a long - range - ordered af state .",
    "the heat conduction due to magnetic excitations has been observed in many low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets , such as one - dimensional spin systems cugeo@xmath30,@xcite sr@xmath7cuo@xmath30,@xcite srcuo@xmath7,@xcite and ( sr , ca)@xmath31cu@xmath32o@xmath33,@xcite and also two - dimensional antiferromagnet k@xmath7v@xmath30o@xmath34.@xcite the absence of this high-@xmath27 peak in @xmath19 is obviously due to the much weaker magnetic correlations in the @xmath1 direction compared to that in the cuo@xmath7 plane .",
    "all these behaviors in undoped la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 are consistent with the previously reported data.@xcite it is worthwhile to note that the phononic peak value of @xmath3 ( 27 w / km ) is considerably larger than that of @xmath2 ( 16 w / km ) .",
    "one possible reason for this difference is that the phonon heat transport is intrinsically easier along the @xmath1 axis , which is not so easy to conceive in view of the layered crystal structure of la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 .",
    "another , more likely possibility is that there exists phonon - magnon scattering in the @xmath0 plane that causes additional damping of the phonon peak .",
    "such scattering may also happen in the @xmath1 axis , however , it should be much weaker than in the @xmath0 plane because it is well known that the magnons are good excitations only for the in - plane physics in the la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 system .",

    "let us first discuss the change of the high-@xmath27 magnon peak in @xmath17 for different dopants .",
    "this peak is suppressed very quickly upon sr - doping and in fact completely disappears at only 1% doping concentration . on the other hand ,",
    "the suppression of this peak is much slower in the zn - doped case , where the peak , though gradually suppressed , survives to @xmath11 = 0.04 . to clarify the relation between the high-@xmath27 peak and the nel order , the magnetic susceptibility of lsco and lczo is measured from 5 to 350 k in the magnetic field of 0.5 t applied along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility , where the peak corresponds to the nel transition ( no transition is observed in lsco with @xmath35 0.02 ) .",
    "it is clear ( as has been already reported @xcite ) that sr doping is much stronger than zn doping in destroying the af long - range order , where the former decreases the nel temperature @xmath36 much more quickly .",
    "the reason is related to the fact that holes introduced by sr are mobile and have 1/2 spin , while zn ( zero spin ) brings static spin vacancy in cuo@xmath7 plane .",
    "figure 3 summarizes the doping dependences of the size of the high-@xmath27 peak in @xmath17 [ defined by the difference between the peak value and @xmath2(100 k ) ] , as well as those of the nel temperature @xmath36 , for the two systems .",
    "this result confirms that the magnon peak is quickly diminished as @xmath36 is reduced .",
    "it is useful to note that the disorder in the nel state induced by sr doping appears to be detrimental to the magnon heat transport , because the magnon peak completely disappears at @xmath10 = 0.01 even though the nel order is still established at 240 k for this sr doping .",
    "peak in @xmath17 [ defined by the difference between the peak value and @xmath2(100 k ) ] of la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 and la@xmath7cu@xmath8zn@xmath9o@xmath6 single crystals .",
    "( b ) doping dependences of the nel temperature @xmath36 for the two cases.,width=207 ]      more interesting changes happen in the suppression of the phonon peak at low temperatures .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "1 that in @xmath17 the peak magnitude decreases more quickly with zn doping than with sr doping ; on the contrary , the peak value in @xmath3 decreases much more quickly with sr doping than with zn doping .",
    "it should be noted that those peculiar differences between sr doping and zn doping can not be due to the additional electronic thermal conductivity in the sr - doped samples : the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath37 can roughly be estimated by the wiedemann - franz law , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the electrical resistivity and @xmath40 is the lorenz number ( which can be approximated by the sommerfeld value , @xmath41 w@xmath42/k@xmath43 ) . using the resistivity data for our crystals,@xcite the contribution @xmath44 for la@xmath45sr@xmath46cuo@xmath6 can be estimated to be smaller than 0.25 w / km in the whole temperature region [ dashed line in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , and samples with lower sr doping should have smaller @xmath44 than this estimate for @xmath10 = 0.04 ; clearly , the electronic contribution can be safely neglected in the lightly sr doped region in the discussion of the @xmath17 behavior , not to mention the @xmath47 behavior .",
    "thus , the changes in the low - temperature peak upon doping must be due to the changes in the phonon transport properties , that is , the scattering process that determines the phonon mean free path .",
    "= 0.12 ) single crystals to that of nd- and eu - doped crystals , in which the phonon peak re - appears .",
    "the data for both ( a ) @xmath17 and ( b ) @xmath47 are shown.,width=245 ]    although both the phonon - impurity scattering and the phonon - carrier scattering can contribute to the suppression of the phonon peak , these scattering processes can not be the only mechanisms to determine the sr - doping dependence of the phonon heat transport , because the phonon peak re - appears in overdoped lsco and in re - doped lsco.@xcite figure 4 shows our data for the re - appearance of the phonon peak in re - doped samples ( both nd and eu doped cases ) for @xmath10 = 0.12 ; these data are taken on single crystals , and essentially confirms the polycrystalline data reported by baberski _",
    "_ @xcite the single crystal data of fig .",
    "4 allow us to compare the absolute values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the re - doped samples to those of the re - free lsco ; such comparison tells us that the low-@xmath27 peak values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the re - doped crystals at @xmath10 = 0.12 are similar to those of the re - free lsco crystals at @xmath10 = 0.04 , despite the factor of three difference in the sr concentrations .",
    "this result clearly indicates that the phonon - impurity scattering and the phonon - carrier scattering are not the only scattering mechanisms to determine the phonon mean free path .",
    "based on the apparent similarity of the doping dependence of the phonon peak in @xmath2 , shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , one might naively conclude that the lattice disorders induced by zn and sr in the @xmath0 plane are very similar and that the @xmath17 behavior is essentially explained only by the lattice disorder ; however , this is not likely to be the case , which can be understood by considering the nature of the impurity scattering and the additional charge carriers introduced in lsco .",
    "first , it is important to notice that the low-@xmath27 phonon peak in @xmath2 is suppressed slightly more quickly by zn doping than by sr doping . in the impurity - scattering scenario,@xcite it is difficult to conceive that the phonons are scattered more strongly in lczo than in lsco , because the atomic mass difference between cu and zn is much smaller than that between la and sr .",
    "in addition , the contribution of the phonon - carrier scattering , which exists only in lsco , would cause the phonon peak in lsco to be suppressed more quickly than in lczo .",
    "thus , the difference between the sr - doping dependence and the zn - doping dependence in @xmath17 at low temperature , which is opposite to the naturally expected trend , suggests that there are additional scatterers of phonons in the zn doped samples .",
    "it is most likely that the additional scatterers in lczo are of magnetic origin ; magnons , which cause the high - temperature peak in lczo , are an obvious candidate , and the magnetic disordering around zn atoms may also cause some scattering of phonons through magnetoelastic coupling.@xcite it is useful to note that , as we mentioned in section iii a , magnons are likely to be already responsible for the relatively small phonon peak in @xmath2 ( compared to that in @xmath3 ) in pure la@xmath7cuo@xmath6 .",
    "contrary to the relatively small difference in the phonon peak of @xmath2 between lsco and lczo , the suppression of the phonon peak of @xmath3 is much quicker in lsco than in lczo ; especially , the sharp suppression of the phonon peak from @xmath10 = 0 to 0.01 is quite surprising and is the most striking observation of this work .",
    "apart from the impurity scattering , two different scattering processes of phonons are possibly responsible for the suppression of the @xmath1-axis phonon heat transport .",
    "the first possibility is the magnon - phonon scattering .",
    "this may partly play a role ( particularly in samples where the long - range nel order is established ) in the @xmath1-axis phonon heat transport , although their role is expected to be minor because of the essentially two - dimensional nature of the magnons in the lco system , which means that the magnons can not effectively change the wave vector of the @xmath1-axis phonons .",
    "the second possibility is the scattering of phonons caused by the static stripes that exist only in lsco . in the following , we elaborate on this possibility .",
    "it is known that static spin stripes are formed at low temperatures in lightly doped lsco.@xcite if the charges also form static stripes together with the spins , they certainly cause local lattice distortions .",
    "even if the charges do not conform to the static stripe potentials set by the spins , the spin stripes themselves may well cause local lattice distortions due to the magnetoelastic coupling;@xcite this direct coupling between the spin stripes and the local lattice distortions is in fact very likely , because recently lavrov _ et al . _",
    "found that the spin - lattice coupling is very strong in lightly doped lsco.@xcite it should be noted that the local lattice distortions due to static stripes are _ not _ expected to scatter phonons when the stripes induce only static and _ periodic _ modulation of the lattice ( which is in fact a kind of superlattice ) ; however , possible disordering of stripes in the @xmath1 direction can introduce rather strong scattering of phonons in this direction .",
    "in fact , because of the weak magnetic correlations along the @xmath1 axis , the stripes in neighboring cuo@xmath7 planes are only weakly correlated or even uncorrelated , which is best evidenced by the very short magnetic correlation length @xmath48 in the stripe phase ( usually smaller than the distance between neighboring cuo@xmath7 planes ) in the lightly doped lsco.@xcite    we can further discuss the possible role of static stripes in the suppression of the phonon peak in @xmath2 of lightly doped lsco .",
    "although the stripes are much better ordered in the @xmath0 plane than in the @xmath1 direction,@xcite there are two reasons that phonons in the @xmath0 plane are possibly scattered by the stripes .",
    "first , the static spin stripes were reported to be established at about 30 k to 17 k for @xmath10 = 0.01 to 0.04 by the neutron measurements.@xcite these temperatures are very close to the position of the phonon peak ( 20  25 k ) . near the stripe freezing temperature ,",
    "local lattice distortions are expected to be well developed and yet are slowly fluctuating ( or disordered ) , which would tend to scatter phonons .",
    "second , there is no evidence until today that well periodically - ordered static charge stripes are formed in lightly doped lsco ; instead , our charge transport data strongly suggest @xcite that the charge stripes exist in a liquid ( or nematic ) state.@xcite such disordered state of charge stripes would tend to scatter phonons .",
    "thus , it is possible that the static stripes also contribute to the scattering of phonons in the in - plane heat transport in lsco , although their effect appears to be much weaker than that in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "we have measured the @xmath0-plane and the @xmath1-axis thermal conductivities of lightly doped lsco and lczo single crystals .",
    "it is found that the low - temperature phonon peak is significantly suppressed upon sr or zn doping even at very low doping levels , and that the doping dependence show clear differences between the sr and zn dopants , and between @xmath2 and @xmath49 .",
    "the experimental observations can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the phonon peak in @xmath3 decreases much more quickly with sr doping than with zn doping .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , the phonon peak in @xmath2 is suppressed slightly more quickly with zn doping than with sr doping .",
    "( iii ) at high temperature , the magnon peak in @xmath17 decreases much more quickly with sr doping than with zn doping ; in fact , the magnon peak completely disappears in lsco with @xmath10 = 0.01 , while it is still observable in lczo with @xmath11 = 0.04 .",
    "( iv ) rare - earth ( nd or eu ) doping for lsco ( @xmath10 = 0.12 ) enhances the phonon heat transport in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and this is manifested in the re - appearance of the low temperature phonon peak , whose height is similar to that of rare - earth - free lsco with @xmath50 .",
    "based on the peculiar doping dependences of the low - temperature phonon peak , we can deduce the following conclusions for the phonon heat transport at low temperatures : ( i ) in the in - plane direction , disordered static stripes are probably working as scatterers of phonon ( in addition to the sr impurities and the holes ) in lsco , while in lczo magnetic scatterings cause strong damping of the phonon transport , which overcompensates the absence of the stripe scattering .",
    "( ii ) in the @xmath1-axis heat transport , besides the possible contribution of the magnon - phonon scattering , strong disorder of the stripe arrangement along the @xmath1-axis is mainly responsible for the scattering of phonons .",
    "the latter scattering mechanism naturally explains the strong damping of the phonon peak in lsco , while allowing much slower suppression of the phonon peak in lczo where there is no stripe .",
    "therefore , the effect of static spin stripes , which are formed in the lightly doped lsco , appears to be most dramatically observed in the @xmath1-axis phonon heat transport ."
