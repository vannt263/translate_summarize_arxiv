    "the possibility of the existence of pentaquarks has been theoretically discussed for many years . however , the subject has been thrust to the forefront during the past two years by the report of the possible observation of a such a state at spring-8 @xcite and itep @xcite . this",
    "was immediately followed up by several positive signals from groups analyzing previously obtained data @xcite , so that at this writing there are more than a dozen observations of a state having mass @xmath0  mev , strangeness @xmath1 , ( the negative of that for normal strange baryons ) , and very narrow width @xmath2  mev @xcite .",
    "this new state , dubbed @xmath3 @xcite , was identified as a candidate for the @xmath4 lowest lying member of a predicted pentaquark baryon anti - decuplet @xcite , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : antidecuplet ] .",
    "in addition to the exotic @xmath3 , the anti - decuplet predicts the existence of two other exotic states which have s=-2 and charge q=-2 and q=+1 , denoted @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the subscript `` 5 '' indicates the five - quark ( pentaquark ) nature of the states and is used to distinguish them from ordinary cascade states .",
    "these exotic cascade states have isospin 3/2 .",
    "two additional partners , denoted @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are also 5-quark states but are not explicitly exotic .",
    "the cern na49 collaboration has recently reported evidence for @xmath5 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the hera h1 collaboration reported the observation of a narrow resonance in @xmath10 and @xmath11 invariant mass combinations in inelastic electron - proton collisions  @xcite .",
    "the resonance has a mass of 3099@xmath125 mev and a measured gaussian width of 12@xmath12 3 mev , compatible with the experimental resolution .",
    "the resonance was interpreted as a possible anti - charmed pentaquark baryon with a minimal constituent quark composition of @xmath13 , together with the charge conjugate .",
    "still , there are important difficulties which need to be resolved before any claims can be made about the existence of pentaquarks .",
    "perhaps most importantly , several high - energy accelerator laboratories have been unable to observe any corroborating signal , even in cases with high statistical precision @xcite .    in the following section we review the current experimental situation , and planned second generation experiments , with emphasis on the jlab program .",
    "the properties of the observed candidate pentaquark signals involving a variety of probes and targets are presented in table [ table : results ] .",
    ".the @xmath3 positive observations [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    carefully controlled parallel independent analysis are being performed to insure maximum reliability of the results .",
    "the possible reaction and decay modes which are the object of the analysis are shown in table  [ table : g10_2 ] .",
    "both decay modes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are being analyzed in missing mass and invariant mass distributions .",
    "the results are expected to be released before the end of 2004 .",
    "* search for the ground and excited states from protons * ( _ g11 , super - g _ ) @xcite .",
    "this consists of two experiments , each with an order of magnitude more statistics than was available for our previously published result on the proton  @xcite and preliminary ( unpublished ) lower energy data @xcite .",
    "the first ( _ g11 _ , which utilized a tagged photon maximum energy of 4 gev successfully completed data taking at the end of july 2004 . the goal was primarily to check for the existence of the @xmath3 and other possible members of the anti - decuplet on a proton target .    the second ( _ super - g _ )",
    "will be a comprehensive study of exotic baryons from a proton target with a maximum photon energy of about 5.5 gev , with @xmath16 tagged photons rate , and broad kinematic coverage for a variety of channels .",
    "its goal is to corroborate the previously published results at a similar energy , to get information about the pentaquark spin by measuring decay angular distributions , and its reaction mechanism by measuring its t - dependence .",
    "we will also investigate the possibility of an intermediate resonance near w=2.4 gev as we reported in ref .",
    "another goal is to try to verify the existence of exotic cascades which were reported by na49  @xcite .",
    "the experiment is scheduled to run mid to late 2005 .    to achieve the goals of these experiments it was necessary to design ,",
    "fabricate and assemble a new longer target ( 40 cm ) and new detectors around the target to provide improved event triggering and particle identification .",
    "as mentioned , the first run ( _ g11 _ ) was successfully completed .",
    "there are @xmath17 events collected with 80  pb@xmath18 integrated luminosity .",
    "the calibration of the different clas detectors , and checking of the clas performance is under way .",
    "we expect to have the first physics result near the beginning of 2005 .",
    "the reactions under study are : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath26 reaction , showing the @xmath27 peak .",
    "( preliminary clas data . ) , width=264 ]     reaction .",
    "the neutron peak is clearly seen .",
    "( preliminary clas data ) . , width=264 ]    the performance of the clas setup is demonstrated in figs.[fig : g11_2 ] and [ fig : g11_1 ] .",
    "the missing mass resolution ( @xmath28 mev / c@xmath29 ) and invariant mass resolution for the @xmath27 meson ( @xmath30 mev / c@xmath29 ) is in agreement with spectrometer specifications .",
    "the background under the missing mass peaks will be reduced after the detector will be fully calibrated .    * the search for exotic cascades using an untagged virtual photon beam * ( _ eg3 _ ) @xcite .",
    "the na49 evidence for the @xmath5 and the @xmath8 at a mass of 1.86 gev @xcite was obtained from reconstruction of their decay products using the decays @xmath31 and @xmath32 . to date",
    "no other experiments have been able to confirm this observation .",
    "_ eg3 _ is a new clas experiment searching for exotic cascades using an untagged virtual photon beam .",
    "the experiment is most sensitive to the @xmath5 and @xmath7 , by means of reconstruction from their decay products .",
    "the main goal of the experiment will be to search for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "other decay modes are detectable with lower sensitivity .",
    "the experiment is designed to utilize the highest luminosity possible with clas .",
    "it will use a 5.7 gev electron beam incident on a deuterium target but without detecting the scattered electron .",
    "the untagged photon beam is necessary to achieve sufficient sensitivity to the expected small cross sections .",
    "the sequence of weakly decaying daughter particles provides a powerful tool to pick out the reactions of interest .",
    "the sensitivity of the experiment is expected to be 46 detected events per nb , and is scheduled to take data in december 2004 .    * high resolution search for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in hall a * @xcite .",
    "the experiment has already completed data taking in june 2004 .",
    "it used a liquid hydrogen target and detected a forward @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) and scattered electron using the 2-arms of the high resolution spectrometers of hall - a @xcite .",
    "the reactions under study are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the missing mass system then had the characteristics of doubly - positive - charged ( @xmath38 forward ) or neutral ( @xmath39 forward ) pentaquark states predicted in certain theoretical models .",
    "an excellent missing mass resolution provides the tool to search for narrow - width states . the online spectrum is presented in fig .  [ fig : bogdan ] .",
    "once again , data analysis is underway , with results expected in fall 2004 .",
    "many laboratories are involved in the search for pentaquarks , using a wide variety of beams , targets and final states .",
    "several laboratories have reported positive observation of the signal , but with rather low statistical precision , while others observe null results .",
    "most , but not all , positive observations were made at lower energy facilities and in exclusive reactions , while almost all of the null results have been at high energy facilities with inclusive reactions .",
    "thus , at this time the existence of a narrow pentaquark state is not fully confirmed .",
    "the question of whether pentaquarks exist can only be resolved by a second generation of high statistics experiments .",
    "jlab is in a unique position to address this .",
    "the experimental program which we have begun is expected to increase the integrated luminosity by more than an order of magnitude for each experiment over what was previously reported .",
    "data for three of these experiments is already in hand , and we expect to present first results of the series of high - statistics experiments by the end of 2004 . stay tuned !    9 t.  nakano _ et al . _ ( leps ) , _ phys .",
