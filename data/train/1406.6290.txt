    "the singularities of the internal manifold are associated to the gauge symmetry .",
    "the basic objects in these constructions are the d7-branes which are located at the `` points '' where the fibre degenerates , while matter fields appear at their intersections .",
    "the interesting fact in this picture is that the topological properties of the internal space are converted to constraints on the effective field theory model in a direct manner .",
    "moreover , in these constructions it is possible to implement a flux mechanism which breaks the symmetry and generates chirality in the spectrum .",
    "f - theory grand unified theories ( f - guts )  @xcite represent a promising framework for addressing the flavour problem of quarks and leptons ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "f - guts are associated with d7-branes wrapping a complex surface @xmath6 in an elliptically fibered eight dimensional internal space .",
    "the precise gauge group is determined by the specific structure of the singular fibres over the compact surface @xmath6 , which is strongly constrained by the kodaira conditions .",
    "the so - called `` semi - local '' approach imposes constraints from requiring that s is embedded into a local calabi - yau four - fold , which in practice leads to the presence of a local @xmath7 singularity @xcite , which is the highest non - abelian symmetry allowed by the elliptic fibration .    in the convenient higgs bundle picture and",
    "in particular the spectral cover approach , one may work locally by picking up a subgroup of @xmath7 as the gauge group of the four - dimensional effective model while the commutant of it with respect to @xmath7 is associated to the geometrical properities in the vicinity .",
    "monodromy actions , which are always present in f - theory constructions , may reduce the rank of the latter , leaving intact only a subgroup of it .",
    "the remaining symmetries could be @xmath8 factors in the cartan subalgebra or some discrete symmetry .",
    "therefore , in these constructions guts are always accompanied by additional symmetries which play important role in low energy pheomenology through the restrictions they impose on superpotential couplings .    in the above approach ,",
    "all yukawa couplings originate from this single point of @xmath7 enhancement . as such",
    ", we can learn about the matter and couplings of the semi - local theory by decomposing the adjoint of @xmath7 in terms of representations of the gut group and the perpendicular gauge group . in terms of the local picture",
    "considered so far , matter is localised on curves where the gut brane intersects other 7-branes with extra @xmath8 symmetries associated to them , with this matter transforming in bi - fundamental representations of the gut group and the @xmath8 .",
    "yukawa couplings are then induced at points where three matter curves intersect , corresponding to a further enhancement of the gauge group .",
    "since @xmath7 is the highest symmetry of the elliptic fibration , the gauge symmetry of the effective model can in principle be any of the @xmath7 subgroups .",
    "the gauge symmetry can be broken by turning on appropriate fluxes @xcite which at the same time generate chirality for matter fields .",
    "the minimal scenario of @xmath2 gut has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "indeed only the simplest @xmath2 guts can in principle avoid exotic matter in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , by considering different fluxes , other models have been constructed with different gut groups , such as @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite . in particular , it is possible to achieve gauge coupling unification from @xmath10 in the presence of tev scale exotics originating from both the matter curves and the bulk  @xcite .",
    "all of the approaches mentioned so far exploit the extra @xmath8 symmetries as family symmetries , in order to address the quark and lepton mass hierarchies . while it is gratifying that such symmetries can arise from a string derived model , where the parameter space is subject to constraints from the first principles of the theory , the possibility of having only continuous abelian family symmetry in f - theory represents a very restrictive choice .",
    "by contrast , other string theories have a rich group structure embodying both continuous as well as discrete symmetries at the same time  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it may be regarded as something of a drawback of the f - theory approach that the family symmetry is constrained to be a product of @xmath8 symmetries .",
    "indeed the results of the neutrino oscillation experiments are in agreement with an almost maximal atmospheric mixing angle @xmath11 , a large solar mixing @xmath12 , and a non - vanishing but smaller reactor angle @xmath13 , all of which could be explained by an underlying non - abelian discrete family symmetry ( for recent reviews see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , discrete symmetries in f - theory have been considered  @xcite on an elliptically fibered space with an @xmath2 gut singularity , where the effective theory is invariant under a more general non - abelian finite group .",
    "they considered all possible monodromies which induce an additional discrete ( family - type ) symmetry on the model . for",
    "the @xmath2 gut minimal unification scenario in particular , the accompanying discrete family group could be any subgroup of the @xmath3 permutation symmetry , and the spectral cover geometries with monodromies associated to the finite symmetries @xmath14 , @xmath0 and their transitive subgroups , including the dihedral group @xmath15 and @xmath16 , were discussed . however a detailed analysis was only presented for the @xmath16 case , while other cases such as @xmath0 were not fully developed into a realistic model .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis in  @xcite in order to construct realistic models based on the cases @xmath0 and @xmath1 , combined with @xmath2 gut , comparing our results to existing field theory models based on these groups .",
    "we provide an explicit calculation to support the emergence of the family symmetry as from the discrete monodromies . in section 2",
    "we start with a short description of the basic ingredients of f - theory model building and present the splitting of the spectral cover in the components associated to the @xmath14 and @xmath1 discrete group factors . in section 3",
    "we discuss the conditions for the transition of @xmath14 to @xmath17 discrete family symmetry `` escorting '' the @xmath2 gut and propose a discrete version of the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism for @xmath0 , before constructing a realistic model which is analysed in detail . in section 4",
    "we then analyse in detail an @xmath1 model which was not considered at all in  @xcite and in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "additional computational details are left for the appendices .",
    "f - theory is a non - perturbative formulation of type iib superstring theory , emerging from compactifications on a calabi - yau fourfold which is an elliptically fibered space over a base @xmath18 of three complex dimensions .",
    "our gut symmetry in the present work is @xmath2 which is associated to a holomorphic divisor residing inside the threefold base , @xmath18 .",
    "if we designate with @xmath19 the ` normal ' direction to this gut surface , the divisor can be thought of as the zero limit of the holomorphic section @xmath19 in @xmath18 , i.e. at @xmath20 .",
    "the fibration is described by the weierstrass equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 are eighth and twelveth degree polynomials respectively .",
    "the singularities of the fiber are determined by the zeroes of the discriminant @xmath23 and are associated to non - abelian gauge groups . for a smooth weierstrass model",
    "they have been classified by kodaira and in the case of f - theory these have been used to describe the non - abelian gauge group . under these conditions , the highest symmetry in the elliptic fibration is @xmath7 and since the gut symmetry in the present work is chosen to be @xmath2 , its commutant is @xmath24 .",
    "the physics of the latter is nicely captured by the spectral cover , described by a five - degree polynomial [ su5perp ]    c_5:&_k=0 ^ 5 b_ks^5-k=0 ,    where @xmath25 are holomorphic sections and @xmath26 is an affine parameter . under the action of certain fluxes and possible monodromies , the polynomial could in principle be factorised to a number of irreducible components @xmath27 provided that new coefficients preserve the holomorphicity .",
    "given the rank of the associated group ( @xmath24 ) , the simplest possibility is the decomposition into four @xmath8 factors , but this is one among many possibilities . as a matter of fact , in an f - theory context , the roots of the spectral cover equation are related by non - trivial monodromies . for the @xmath24 case at hand , under specific circumstances ( related mainly to the properties of the internal manifold and flux data )",
    "these monodromies can be described by any possible subgroup of the weyl group @xmath3 .",
    "this has tremendous implications in the effective field theory model , particularly in the superpotential couplings .",
    "the spectral cover equation  ( [ su5perp ] ) has roots @xmath28 , which correspond to the weights of @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath29 . the equation describes the matter curves of a particular theory , with roots being related by monodromies depending on the factorisation of this equation .",
    "thus , we may choose to assume that the spectral cover can be factorised , with new coefficients @xmath30 that lie within the same field",
    "@xmath31 as @xmath32 . depending on how we factorise , we will see different monodromy groups .",

    "next , in a more involved example , we allow for a general majorana mass matrix and initially determine stable regions of the parameter space which are consistent with tb - mixing .",

    "from considering the symmetry properties of a regular tetrahedron , we can see quite easily that it can be parameterised by four coordinates and its transformations can be decomposed into a mere two generators . if we write these coordinates as a basis for @xmath0 , which is the symmetry group of the tetrahedron , it would be of the form @xmath178 .",
    "the two generators can then be written in matrix form explicitly as : @xmath179 however , it is well known that @xmath0 has an irreducible representation in the form of a singlet and triplet under these generators .",
    "if we consider the tetrahedron again , this can be physically interpreted by observing that under any rotation through one of the vertices of the tetrahedron the vertex chosen remains unmoved under the transformation . in order to find the irreducible representation , we must note some conditions that this decomposition will satisfy . + in order to obtain the correct basis , we must find a unitary transformation @xmath180 that block diagonalises the generators of the group . as such",
    ", we have the following conditions : @xmath181 as well as the usual conditions that must be satisfied by the generators : @xmath182 .",
    "it will also be useful to observe three extra conditions , which will expedite finding the solution .",
    "namely that the block diagonal of one of the two generators must have zeros on the diagonal to insure the triplet changes within itself .",
    "+ if we write an explicit form for v , @xmath183 we can extract a set of quadratic equations and attempt to solve for the elements of the matrix . note that we have assumed as a starting point that @xmath184 .",
    "the complete list is included in the appendix .",
    "the problem is quite simple , but at the same time would be awkward to solve numerically , so we shall attempt to simplify the problem analytically first . if we start be using : @xmath185 we can trivially see two quadratics , @xmath186 since we assume that all our elements or v are real numbers , it must be true then that : @xmath187 we may now substitute this result into a number of equations .",
    "however , we chose to focus on the following two : @xmath188 taking the difference of these two equations , we can easily see there is a solution where @xmath189 , and as such by the previous result : @xmath190 we are free to choose whichever sign for these four elements we please , provided they all have the same sign .",
    "this outcome reduces the number of useful equations to twelve , as nine of them can be summarised as @xmath191 let us consider the first of these three derived conditions , along with the conditions : @xmath192 squaring the condition @xmath193 and using these relations , we can derive easily that @xmath194 .",
    "likewise we can derive the same for @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "as before , we might chose either sign for each of these elements , with each possibility yielding a different outcome for the basis , though our choices will constrain the signs of the remaining elements in v. + let us make a choice for the signs of our known coefficients in the matrix and choose them all to be positive for simplicity .",
    "we are now left with a much smaller set of conditions : @xmath197 after a few choice rearrangements , these coefficients can be calculated numerically in mathematica .",
    "this yields a unitary matrix , @xmath198 up to exchanges of the bottom three rows , which arises due to the fact the triplet arising in this representation may be ordered arbitrarily .",
    "there is also a degree of choice involved regarding the sign of the rows .",
    "however , this is again largely unimportant as the result would be equivalent .",
    "+ if we apply this transformation to our original basis @xmath28 , we find that we have a singlet and a triplet in the new basis , @xmath199 and that our generators become block - diagonal : @xmath200      @xmath201",

    "the top - type quarks have four non - vanishing couplings , while the @xmath208 and @xmath209 couplings vanishings due to the chosen vacuum expectations : @xmath210 and @xmath211 . + the contribution to the heaviest generation self - interaction is due to the @xmath212 operator : @xmath213 we note that this is the lowest order operator in the top - type quarks , so should dominate the hierarchy . +",
    "the interaction between the third generation and the lighter two generations is determined by the @xmath214 operator : @xmath215 + the remaining , first - second generation operators give contributions , in brief : @xmath216 these will be subject to rank theorem arguments , so that only one of the generations directly gets a mass from the yukawa interaction .",
    "however the remaining generation will gain a mass due to instantons and non - commutative fluxes , as in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the charged leptons and bottom - type quarks come from the same operators in the gut group , though in this exposition we shall work in terms of the charged leptons .",
    "the complication for charged leptons is that the left - handed doublet is an @xmath0 triplet , while the right - handed singlets of the weak interaction are singlets of the monodromy group .",
    "there are a total of six contributions to the yukawa matrix , with the third generation right - handed types being generated by two operators .",
    "+ the operators giving mass to the interactions of the right - handed third generation are dominated by the tree level operator @xmath217 , which gives a contribution as : @xmath218 clearly this should dominated the next order operator , however when we choose a vacuum expectation for the @xmath219 field , we will have contributions from @xmath220 : @xmath221 the generation of yukawas for the lighter two generations comes , at leading order , from the operators @xmath222 and @xmath223 : @xmath224 where the vacuum expectations for @xmath225 and @xmath226 are as before .",
    "the next order of operator take the same form , but with corrections due to the flavon triplet , @xmath227 .",
    "@xmath228    @xmath229      the neutrino sector admits masses of both dirac and majorana types . in the @xmath0 model ,",
    "the right - handed neutrino is assigned to a matter curve constituting a singlet of the gut group .",
    "however it is a triplet of the @xmath0 family symmetry , which along with the @xmath230 doublet will generate complicated structures under the group algebra .",
    "the dirac mass terms coupling left and right - handed neutrinos comes from a maximum of four operators .",
    "the leading order operators are @xmath231 and @xmath232 , where as we have already seen the gut singlet flavons @xmath225 and @xmath226 are used to cancel @xmath204 charges .",
    "the right - handed neutrino is presumed to live on the gut singlet @xmath227 .",
    "+ the first of the operators , @xmath231 , contributes via two channels : @xmath233 the second leading order operator , @xmath234 , is more cimplicated due to the presence of four @xmath0 triplet fields .",
    "the simpelst contribution to the operator is : @xmath235 which only contributes to the diagonal .",
    "this is accompanied by two similar operators in the way of : @xmath236 the remaining contribtuions are the complicated four - triplet products . however , upon retaining to our previous vacuum expectation values , these will all vanish , leaving an overall matrix of : @xmath237 where @xmath238 as before . these contributions will produce a large mixing between the second and third generations , however they do not allow for mixing with the first generation .",
    "+ corrections from the next order operators will give a weaker mixing with the first generation .",
    "these correcting terms are @xmath239 and @xmath240 , though we choose to only consider the first of these two operators , since the flavon @xmath225 will generate a very complicated structure , hindering computations with little obvious benefit in terms of model building .",
    "the @xmath239 operator has of diagonal contributions as : @xmath241 this is mirrored by similar combinations from the other 3 triplet - triplet combinations allowed by the algebra .",
    "overall , this gives :    @xmath242    due to the choice of higgs vacuum expectation , the diagonal contributions will only correct the first generation mass , giving a contribution to it @xmath243 .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos are also given a mass by majorana terms .",
    "these are as it transpires relatively simple .",
    "the leading order term @xmath244 , gives a diagonal contribtuion : @xmath245 there may also be corrections to the off diagonal , due to operators such as @xmath246 .",
    "these yield:@xmath247 higher orders of the flavon @xmath227 are also permitted , but should be suppressed by the coupling .",
    "for completeness , we discribe here in a simple manner the flux mechanism introduced to break symmetries and generate chirality .",
    "@xmath248 we start with the @xmath249-flux inside of @xmath250 .    the @xmath251 s and @xmath252 s reside on matter curves @xmath253 while are characterised by their defining equations . from the latter",
    ", we can deduce the corresponding homologies @xmath254 following the standard procedure .",
    "if we turn on a @xmath249-flux @xmath255 , we can determine the flux restrictions on them which are expressed in terms of integers through the `` dot product '' @xmath256 the flux is responsible for the @xmath2 breaking down to the standard model and this can happen in such a way that the @xmath249 gauge boson remains massless  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , flux affects the multiplicities of the sm - representations carrying non - zero @xmath249-charge .",
    "thus , on a certain @xmath257 matter curve for example , we have su(5)\\ {    lll n_(3,1)_-13-n_(|3,1)_13&= & m_5 + n_(1,2)_12-n_(1 , 2)_-12&= & m_5 + n_y_i    . [",

    ". we can arrange for example @xmath259 to eliminate the doublets or @xmath260 to eliminate the triplet .",
    "@xmath248 let s turn now to the @xmath261 .",
    "the @xmath1 factor is associated to the three roots @xmath262 which can split to a singlet and a doublet @xmath263 it is convenient to introduce the two new linear combinations @xmath264 and rewrite the doublet as follows _",

    "the singlet @xmath270 does not transform under @xmath268 , hence this flux will split the multiplicities as follows _ t_i \\ {    lll ( * 10 * , * 1*_s_3)&= & m + ( * 10 * , * 2*_s_3)&= & m+ n_a    .",
    "this choice will also break the @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath271 .",
    "\\2 ) turning on a flux along the singlet direction @xmath272 will preserve @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the multiplicities now read _ t_i \\ {    lll ( * 10 * , * 1*_s_3)&= & m+ n_s + ( * 10 * , * 2*_s_3)&= & m    .",
    "to get rid of the doublets we choose @xmath273 while because flux restricts non - trivially on the matter curve , the number of singlets can differ by just choosing @xmath274 .",
    "to solve the @xmath275 constraint we have repeatidly introduced a new section @xmath276 and assumed factorisation of the involved @xmath277 coefficients . to check the validity of this assumption , we take as an example the @xmath278 case , where @xmath279",
    "we note first that the coefficients @xmath25 are holomorphic functions of @xmath19 , and as such they can be expressed as power series of the form @xmath280 where @xmath281 do not depend on @xmath19 .",
