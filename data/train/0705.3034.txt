    "it is well known that at sufficiently low temperature , an electron with spin up is paired with its partner with spin down across the fermi surface to form a cooper pair with total momentum zero and becomes superconductor and exhibits superfluid property .",
    "this phenomenon is well described by bardeen - copper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory .",
    "the most favorable condition for paring is when spin up and spin down electrons have the same density .",
    "now imagine one apply a magnetic field to split the spin up and spin down electrons by zeeman effect and look at the response of a superconductor to the zeeman splitting .",
    "for @xmath0-wave superconductor , if the zeeman splitting @xmath1 is very small compared to the gap , then the superconducting state is stable , if it is much larger than the gap , the superconducting state will turn into a normal state .",
    "when @xmath2 is comparable to the energy gap @xmath3 at zero magnetic field , it may becomes non - trivial .",
    "it was argued by fulde and ferrell @xcite , larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite about 40 years ago that an in - homogeneous superconductor with pairing order parameter oscillating in space may be the ground state at a narrow window of zeeman splitting @xmath4 @xcite ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this in - homogeneous state is called loff state where the cooper pairs carry a finite momentum . in ff state ,",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 , the cooper pairs carry finite superfluid momentum , while in the lo state , @xmath7 , the cooper pairs carry two opposite momenta",
    ". the loff state breaks both @xmath8 gauge symmetry and translational order .",
    "unfortunately , so far , the loff state has never been observed in conventional superconductors , because in these systems , the zeeman effect is overwhelmed by orbital effects . however , this loff state has attracted renewed interests in the context of organic , heavy fermion and high @xmath9 cuprates @xcite , because these new classes of superconductors may provide favorable conditions to realize the loff state .",
    "recently , experiments @xcite on penetration depth measurement on @xmath10 shows that at a temperature below 250 mk , for magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath11 plane , two phase transitions were detected , one of which maybe identified as a phase transition from loff state to normal state transition . also the measurement of thermal conductivity@xcite on @xmath10 shows anisotropy in real space , which could be interpreted as domain wall formation , namely , a stripe phase but possibly with higher harmonics .",
    "loff states also played important roles in high density quark matter , astrophysics @xcite and superconductor - ferromagnet heterostructures @xcite . with the development of trapped cold atoms system ,",
    "it was proposed that due to absence of orbital effects , ultracold neutral fermion gases with unequal populations may realize the loff state in a tiny window on the bcs side of feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "recently , it was argued in @xcite that the lo state , in fact , may be stable in an appreciate regime in the bcs side of the feshbach resonance .     is the zeeman splitting , @xmath12 is the temperature , @xmath3 is the energy gap at the balanced case @xmath13 .",

    "it is easy to see the minima is located at the `` roton '' surface @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "2b ) , in sharp contrast to @xmath31 case where the minimum is at @xmath32 .",
    "this class of problems with minima located at @xmath33 was first investigated in @xcite and has wide applications in the context of liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "when @xmath34 , the system is in the paramagnetic ( p ) phase with @xmath35 , while when @xmath36 , it is in a modulated ( m ) phase with the mean field structure @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 transition happens at @xmath39 , namely , @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the @xmath24 phase breaks both the internal @xmath41 rotational symmetry and the translational symmetry , therefore supports two kinds of goldstone modes : phase mode due to the @xmath41 symmetry breaking and the lattice phonon mode due to the translational symmetry breaking . at the mean field theory , the p - m transition is 2nd order . under fluctuations , for @xmath42 , the roton surface in fig.2b , in fact , turns into two isolated points , the transition which describes nematic - smectic a transition in liquid crystal remains 2nd order .",
    "however , for @xmath43 , the transition becomes a fluctuation driven 1st order transition as shown by renormalization group analysis in @xcite .",
    "indeed , to some extent , the loff phase diagram fig.2 looks similar to fig . 1 if we identify zeeman splitting @xmath44 as the pressure @xmath45 , normal phase as the paramagnetic phase , the superconducting phase as the ferromagnetic phase and the loff state as the modulated phase",
    ".    of course , the original pairing problem of fermions with unequal populations are a fermionic problem .",
    "however , just like usual normal state to bcs superconductor transition , one can integrate out fermions at any finite temperature and lead to the following ginsburg - landau free energy describing the normal state to the loff state transition @xcite : @xmath46+e|\\psi|^6 , \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 .",

    "this @xmath24 phase is the loff state .",
    "the loff state breaks both @xmath8 symmetry and the translational symmetry , therefore it supports two kinds of goldstone modes .",
    "( 1 ) the goldstone mode due to the @xmath8 symmetry breaking , but it was `` eaten '' by the gauge field due to higgs mechanism in electron pairing case in condensed matter system , but will stay in the neutral atom pairing case in ultra cold atom atomic experiments ( 2 ) the lattice phonon modes due to the translational symmetry breaking , they will survive the gauge field fluctuations . in this paper , we approach the loff state from the normal state and try to determine what is the lowest lattice structure of the loff state .",
    "@xmath60 corresponds to the ff state , @xmath61 corresponds to the lo state .",
    "it is known that the ff state , being carry finite superfluid momentum , is always unstable .",
    "the lo state has nodes where the excess fermions reside .",
    "however , it is still not know the lo state is the most favorable lattice structure . in this paper , we will study what is the lowest lattice structure by considering seven most common lattice structures namely the stripe , square , triangular , simple cubic ( sc ) , face centered cubic ( fcc ) , body centered cubic ( bcc ) and quasi - crystal ( qc ) listed in table i. the stripe case corresponds to the original lo state .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we compute the coefficients of the free energy of the loef states with different lattice structures . in section iii , by comparing the free energy and the transition temperature of all the seven lattice structures of loff state , we find the lowest energy lattice structure remains the lo state . in the appendix",
    "a , we discuss in detail how to get the geometrical factors in the fourth and sixth order terms which are used in evaluating the free energy of the seven lattices . as a byproduct , we corrected some over - counting mistakes in describing liquid to solid transition in the textbook in @xcite . in appendix b",

    "<S> starting from the ginzburg - landau free energy describing the normal state to larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) state transition , we evaluate the free energy of seven most common lattice structures such as stripe , square , triangular , simple cubic ( sc ) , face centered cubic ( fcc ) , body centered cubic ( bcc ) and quasi - crystal ( qc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the stripe phase which is the original lo state , is the most stable phase . </S>",
    "<S> this result maybe relevant to the detection of loff state in some heavy fermion compounds and the pairing lattice structure of fermions with unequal populations in the bcs side of feshbach resonance in ultra - cold atoms . </S>"
