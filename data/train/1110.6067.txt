    "there is evidence that every galactic spheroid ( elliptical galaxy or bulge ) hosts a central supermassive black hole , with a strict relationship between the black hole mass and the luminosity , mass , velocity dispersion , concentration and binding energy of the host ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian 1998 ; gebhardt 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; ferrarese 2002 ; tremaine 2002 ; bettoni 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ; graham & driver 2007 ; aller & rischstone 2007 ; barway & kembhavi 2007 ) .",
    "this discovery has highlighted the close connection between the process of galaxy formation at large , and the formation of the central black hole ( bh ) , endowed with its quasar activity ; and is currently one of the major observational facts that the theory of galaxy evolution has to explain .    in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "hierarchical cosmological scenario , the usual paradigm is that ( major ) mergers are responsible for the joint origin and growth of black holes and galactic spheroids .",
    "mergers trigger gas inflows feeding bh growth and quasar activity , while at the same time they modify the morphology of the galaxy into a bulge  dominated one ( e.g.  kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; di matteo 2005 ) .",
    "alternative mechanisms link directly the bh growth to the intrinsic star formation activity or morphological evolution of the host ( e.g.  granato 2001 , 2004 ; fontanot 2006 ; bower 2006 ) .",
    "all these scenarios share an important feature : a quasar marks a very specific , short but crucial phase in the evolution of a galaxy .",
    "the host is expected to be a `` young spheroid '' where strong star formation ( intrinsic or merger  induced ) has just halted , by quasar feedback or by mere consumption of the cold gas that fed both the starburst and the quasar .",
    "thereafter the galaxy rapidly reddens and evolves passively , while the central black hole becomes a `` dead quasar '' or a `` dormant black hole '' ( springel 2005a ; hopkins 2008 ; johansson 2009ab )  until , possibly , later mergers or gas infall revive star formation and/or agn activity .    on the observational side ,",
    "major advances have been achieved in the past few years : a suitable number of detected quasar host galaxies at redshift is nowadays available .",
    "their luminosity apparently follows passive evolution , consistent with that of an elliptical galaxy formed at @xmath8 ( kotilainen 2009 ) , in contrast with the theoretical scenario outlined above . in this paper",
    "we aim at testing whether the predictions of current merger ",
    "based models can be compatible with the available observations of quasar hosts .    direct comparison to data on qso host galaxies",
    "demands theoretical predictions on the properties of galaxies _ specifically at the very phase of optical qso activity _ , as this is supposed to be a short but very critical phase of galaxy formation .",
    "the only explicit predictions in this sense , in the framework of semi  analytical models , seem to date back to kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) ; here we use the most recent public mock catalogue from the munich group to extract the expected properties of quasar host galaxies , and compare them with the latest available data .",
    "we consider in particular recent results on the evolution of the bh mass  host mass ( or luminosity ) relation .",
    "peng ( 2006 ) and decarli ( 2010ab ) find that the bh mass  luminosity relation is roughly constant with redshift ; considering the intrinsic fading of stellar populations with age , this implies that the host stellar mass @xmath9 associated to a given bh mass @xmath10 decreases at high @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the mass ratio @xmath12 is an important constraint on theoretical models , especially regarding the role of quasar feedback ( wyithe & loeb 2005 ; fontanot 2006 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the semi  analytical models in use and how quasar host galaxies are selected from the mock galaxy catalogues . in section  3 and  4",
    "we discuss the evolution of the bh mass  stellar mass and of the bh mass  luminosity relation , compared to observational evidence . in section  5",
    "we discuss the mass function of bh in quasars at high redshift . in section  6",
    "we outline our conclusions and suggestions for future studies . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the problem of transforming observed host luminosities into stellar masses , and the significance of their apparent passive evolution .",
    "for about a decade semi  analytical models ( sam ) , superposing the evolution of visible structures over that of the underlying cdm , treated galaxy formation ( white & rees 1978 ) and quasar activity ( efstathiou & rees 1988 ) separately . after growing evidence of the black hole ",
    "host bulge relation , the two lines of investigation merged : galaxy evolution models have incorporated bh growth and agn activity .",
    "the first `` unified '' model was by kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) , followed by many others ( enoki 2003 ; granato 2004 ; cattaneo 2005 ; menci 2006 ; croton 2006 ; bower 2006 ; fontanot 2006 ; malbon 2007 ; somerville 2008 ; marulli 2008 ; bonoli 2009 ; jahnke & macci 2010 ; fanidakis 2011 ) .",
    "most of these models assume that the joint origin of spheroids and black holes is a consequence of mergers .",
    "in few cases , central bh accretion is ( also ) associated to the intrinsic evolution of the host : to its star formation activity ( granato 2004 ; fontanot 2006 ) or to its morphological transformation from disc to bulge ( bower 2006 ; fanidakis 2011 ) .",
    "another important distinction among the various models is whether quasar feedback at high redshift plays a key role ( e.g.  granato 2004 ; fontanot  2006 ; menci 2006 ; somerville 2008 ) or not .",
    "our discussion relies on the public catalogue of sam galaxies by the munich group ( de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) , based on the millennium simulation ( springel 2005b ) and retrievable from the millennium database .",
    "as to the `` quasar mode '' bh accretion at high redshift , this sam follows essentially the recipe of its prototype kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ; see also croton 2006 ) .",
    "each merger triggers a starburst , and a few percent of the available cold gas mass @xmath13 accretes onto the central bh : @xmath14 the mass of the resulting bh is the sum of the progenitor bh masses , and of the ( dominant ) accreted mass @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is tuned to reproduce the observed local bh mass  bulge mass relation at @xmath3 .",
    "the efficiency of bh growth scales with the mass ratio @xmath17 of the merging galaxies ( `` satellite '' and `` central '' ) so that the fractional contribution of minor mergers to quasar activity is small .",
    "bh accretion in the quasar mode is thus dominated by major mergers ( mass ratio larger than 1:3 ) which result in the formation of a spheroid .",
    "qso activity in this model is always associated to a recent merger and active star formation .",
    "quasar activity is a by - product of the merger , with no impact on the evolution of the galaxy  arguing that any quasar ",
    "induced feedback can be formally included in the strong supernova feedback accompanying the starburst .",
    "the munich sam effectively belong to the no - feedback category in the quasar mode .    the munich sam series has been successfully tested and tuned to reproduce a wide range of observational properties of the galaxy population , such as : galaxy clustering ( springel 2005b ) ; galaxy luminosity function , colour and morphology distributions , colour  magnitude , mass  metallicity and tully  fisher relations , cosmic star formation and bh growth history ( croton 2006 ) ; the formation history of elliptical galaxies ( de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) ; the properties of bright cluster galaxies ( de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "this sam is optimized to describe the galaxy population , but results on the corresponding agn population are discussed by marulli ( 2008 ) and bonoli ( 2009 ) .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the @xmath18 relation in this model is discussed by croton ( 2006 ) .    in our study",
    "we use the available public mock galaxy catalogue of the munich sam ( de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) to discuss the evolution of the scaling relations ( bh mass versus host mass and luminosity ) _ as traced specifically by quasar host galaxies _ up to @xmath4 .      to compare the munich sam to observed data on the bh ",
    "host relation in quasars , we need to know , at each redshift / snapshot of the sam : ( a ) which are the active galaxies , ( b ) their bh masses and ( c ) their stellar masses and luminosities .",
    "all of this information is directly available in the public catalogue of de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) , with no need for further assumptions .",
    "the active galaxies in `` quasar mode '' are those that have just suffered a merger ; we query the database to select recent mergers following the example instructions provided on the web - site .",
    "`` recent merger '' in this case means , merged since the previous redshift snapshot , typically @xmath19  yrs before .",
    "this is longer than the duty cycle of optical quasar activity ( @xmath20  yrs ) so that we can identify the very moment of quasar shining only approximately but it s as close as we can get with the time resolution available in the public sam catalogue .",
    "for the recent merger / quasar mode galaxies we retrieve the following information : bh mass , stellar mass , gas mass and luminosity in various bands .",
    "we also retrieve the bh , stellar and gas mass of the progenitors : this gives us the bh mass growth @xmath21 ( from the mass difference between the progenitor bhs and the resulting bh ) and the merger mass ratio .",
    "we also retrieve bh and galaxy properties for the overall galaxy population , to discuss differences ( in luminosity mainly , see section  [ sect : hostlum ] ) with the quasar host subset .    the quasar population and agn luminosity function associated with these same quasar hosts ,",
    "was studied by marulli ( 2008 ) by adding to the sam various prescriptions about the quasar light curve associated to @xmath10 and @xmath21 in each merger .",
    "notice that their ( or any ) additional assumptions on the quasar light curve do not affect the basic quantities ( bh masses , @xmath21 , galaxy properties etc . )",
    "available in the public mock catalogue , that set the scaling relations in the sam .",
    "we comment later on the results of marulli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in relation to ours , but shall not develop here a new model for the quasar population and light curves as it is not needed to study the scaling relations .    for practical reasons ( avoid overload of unneccessary output data from the database query )",
    "we impose some additional restrictions that do not affect the substance of the quasar host population .    1 .",
    "we consider mergers with a mass ratio ( in cold baryons , i.e.  stellar mass + cold gas mass ) larger than @xmath22 . as major mergers",
    "1:3 largely dominate bh growth ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) , 1:9 is a very safe limit to include all significant optical qso activity  considering that the latter does correspond to the bulk of the bh growth ( soltan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "we checked that , among our final selected objects , major mergers ( with mass ratio larger than 1:3 ) contribute about half of the quasar hosts with @xmath23  @xmath7  and dominate by 7080% at the massive end , @xmath24  @xmath7 .",
    "the quoted percentages are stable with redshift .",
    "we restrict to galaxies hosting a bh mass @xmath25  @xmath7 ; this a conservative choice that fully covers the bh mass range of the observational dataset ( qso hosts at high @xmath11 have @xmath26  @xmath7 ) even including the 0.4  dex error on the measured @xmath10 , discussed later in section  4 . besides , bh masses below our adopted limit hardly contribute to the optical quasar population ( see e.g.  mclure & dunlop 2004 ; shankar 2010 ) ; for instance , in the latest sdss quasar sample of shen ( 2011 ) , only 19 out of over 22.000 bh masses measured with h@xmath27 lines are below @xmath28  @xmath7 .",
    "+ considering specifically the observational qso sample of decarli ( 2010a ) , all objects at @xmath29 have @xmath30 , which is much brighter than expected from our adopted mass cut .",
    "indeed a bh of @xmath28  @xmath7 , emitting typically around 0.5 of its eddington luminosity ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ; labita 2009 ) shines with @xmath31  w , corresponding to @xmath32 ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ) or @xmath33 ( assuming a typical quasar colour @xmath34=0.22 , from cristiani & vio 1990 ) .",
    "clearly our mass cut covers both the mass and luminosity range relevant for comparison to observations . 3 .",
    "we neglect multiple mergers of three or more progenitors , for simplicity in the treatment of the query output ( multiple mergers appear as a repeated double merger in the output list ) .",
    "we also neglect mergers with progenitors identified too early on ( two or more snapshots before , rather than in the immediately previous snapshot ) as the instant of the merger and the corresponding quasar activity is not guaranteed to be very recent , i.e.  the time resolution on the quasar host phase is much worse .",
    "these two criteria together exclude less than 10% of the merger events , bearing no impact on our discussion .",
    "as the soltan argument indicates that optical qso activity traces the bulk of the bh growth , we test the additional requirement that the selected mergers induce a bh growth of more than 50%  a simple , reasonable way to ensure that the merger corresponds to significant quasar activity .",
    "we verified that most of our conclusions are not affected when relaxing this `` doubling '' criterion ; when this is the case , both alternatives are shown ( section  5 ) .",
    "the selected mergers / quasar hosts represent 5 - 6% of the global galaxy population at @xmath35 , and 2% at @xmath36 . at each redshift snapshot between @xmath37 and 3 ,",
    "our discussion is based on a sample of @xmath38 merger galaxies selected as above , out of a global galaxy population of @xmath39 objects .    beyond @xmath40 mergers",
    "are usually considered the main trigger of agn activity , while at lower redshift other mechanisms are likely to contribute or even dominate ( secular evolution and bar  driven instabilities ; mass loss from old stellar populations ; e.g.  hopkins & hernquist 2009 ; kauffmann & heckman 2009 ; cisternas 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , our selection of recent mergers ( and the underlying assumptions in the sam about quasar activity ) may be not well suited for agn hosts at @xmath41 ; but in this paper we are mostly concerned with the hosts of bright quasars at high redshift .",
    "furthermore , at high redshift it is observationally hard to decompose the host galaxy into its bulge / disc component , so the observed scaling relations often refer to the global host galaxy ( a recent exception is bennert 2011 ) . for consistency with this limitation ,",
    "we extract from the sam the scaling relations between bh and host galaxy , rather than host spheroid .",
    "however , as customary in the observational papers , we shall compare the high redshift results for the host _ galaxies _ with the @xmath3 relation between bh and host _ bulge _ ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss sam predictions on the evolution of the bh mass  host mass relation . fig .",
    "[ fig : mbh_mstar_all ] shows the distribution , in the @xmath42 plane , of quasar hosts ( solid contours ) and of the global galaxy population ( dotted contours ) at various redshifts . in this plane ,",
    "the two populations occupy the same loci , i.e.  qso hosts are a fair sample of the general galaxy population ( at least for @xmath26  @xmath7 , the relevant range for high@xmath11 observed quasars ) .    to discuss the evolution of the @xmath42 relation , we need to specify how the relation can be defined in the models . from the physical point of view , neither bh mass nor host stellar mass can be selected to be the independent versus dependent variable , as they both are the result of a third process : galaxy formation and evolution . for this sort of related variables , the best statistical tracer of",
    "the intrinsic mutual relation is a bisector fit relation ( isobe 1990 ; akritas & bershady 1996 ) .",
    "this definition is also the one adopted for the observed relation in the local universe ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "the `` intrinsic '' ( bisector fit ) relation for the sam galaxy catalogue ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbh_mstar_all ] ) at low redshift matches very well the local relation observed at @xmath3 ; and displays little evolution with redshift .",
    "the latter is a general feature of sam that do not include quasar feedback ( wyithe & loeb 2005 ; fontanot 2006 ; malbon 2007 ) .",
    "notice that the slope of the bisector fit relation in the @xmath43 plane turns out to be always close to 1 ; therefore , in practice this definition is very similar to what we would obtain with the more common approach of fixing the slope to 1 and fitting a unique value for the ratio @xmath12 ( e.g.  croton 2006 ; decarli 2010 ) .",
    "we also notice that , for the same sam models considered here , croton ( 2006 ) report a significant evolution in the @xmath18 relation ; this is not in contrast with our findings : most of the evolution he reports is due to the redistribution of stars from the disc to the bulge component , an effect which largely cancels out when we consider the global host galaxy .    the negligible evolution of the intrinsic ( bisector fit ) relation appears in contrast to observational results , when taken at face value ( e.g.peng 2006 ; decarli 2010ab ) .",
    "when comparing to high redshift data , however , we must take into account that quasar hosts are operatively detected starting from qso selected samples , and tend to pick out the median host mass as a function of bh mass ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbh_mstar_all ] ) .",
    "the latter definition of the @xmath44 relation mimics more closely the empirical sampling , and also traces better the contour plots , which are a convolution between the intrinsic bh mass  host mass relation , its scatter , and the mass function of galaxies ( lauer 2007 ) .",
    "there is a systematic bias between the two definitions of the relation : the more luminous quasars tend to trace over  massive bh with respect to the underlying intrinsic bh  host relation .",
    "this is due to the fact that , being massive galaxies very rare , the most massive bh are more easily found as outliers hosted in undermassive ( but more frequent ) hosts .",
    "this bias is discussed extensively by lauer ( 2007 ) and we shall refer to it as the lauer bias . the bias can be defined either as an excess of bh mass at a given host mass / luminosity / velocity dispersion ; or as an offset in host properties at given bh mass . to interpret quasar host data , where the effective independent variable in the selection is the bh mass of the qso , we prefer the latter approach : @xmath45 is the offset in host mass between the median relation marginalized over bh mass , and the intrinsic ( bisector fit ) relation . the lauer bias for the global galaxy population in the sam catalogue is represented in fig .  [ fig : lauer ] and table  [ tab : lauer ] . in these sam , the deviation of the distribution from the intrinsic relation is significant ( @xmath460.2  dex in @xmath47 , i.e.  larger than the typical dispersion ) around @xmath48  @xmath7 . at this bh mass ,",
    "the bias increases from 0.2  dex to 0.6  dex between @xmath49 ; this is comparable to the evolution determined by decarli ( 2010b ) , considering that most of their objects at @xmath50 indeed have @xmath24  @xmath7 .",
    ".lauer bias for the global galaxy population in the sam catalogue .",
    "we indicate the offset @xmath51 ( typically an underestimate : minus sign ) of the median host stellar mass at a given bh mass , with respect to the intrinsic bisector fit relation .",
    "the dispersion is estimated from the 16 and 84 percentiles of the distribution ( corresponding to 1 standard deviation for a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "for the entry in the bottom right corner ( @xmath4 , @xmath48  @xmath7 ) , due to the small number of objects we considered the average logarithmic host mass and the extreme values in the sample . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : lauer ]      the cosmological evolution of the bh / host mass ratio : @xmath52 can contribute to discriminate between different scenarios of co  evolution of central super  massive black hole and host galaxy : models where quasar feedback plays a prominent role predict a stronger evolution in @xmath5 ( increasing in the past ) than models that do not include this effect ( wyithe & loeb 2005 ) ; and different feedback scenarios result in different predictions for @xmath53 ( fontanot 2006 ) .",
    "it is thus tempting to conclude that the strong evolution detected in recent observational studies favours the models that take feedback and self  regulation into account ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_models ] ) .",
    "in particular , it should exclude `` extreme merger scenarios '' where the relation between bh mass and host mass is just the statistical outcome of the stochastic merger history , with no direct physical relation between black hole and bulge formation at the level of individual galaxies ( peng 2007 ; jahnke & macci 2010 ) .",
    "however , an apparent evolution of @xmath5 is seen in the sam due to the lauer bias , as the combination of two factors : ( i ) the slope of the median @xmath44 relation is steeper than 1:1 ( closer to 2:1 ) and ( ii ) the mass function of quasars and the malmquist bias affect the accessible parameter range one can address as a function of redshift .",
    "we sample more luminous and massive quasars at increasing redshift and tendentially find smaller hosts and larger @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : gamma_evol ] illustrates that , when derived from the intrinsic relation ( bisector fit , dashed lines ) , @xmath5 is close to the local reference value with little evolution ( about 0.2  dex offset between @xmath3 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "in contrast , the median @xmath5 at @xmath48  @xmath7  shows a significant offset ( a factor of 23 already at low redshift ) and evolution with respect to the local value .",
    "this apparent evolution of @xmath5 due to the lauer bias is comparable to that traced by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_models ] , considering that observational samples mostly include qsos with @xmath24  @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath5 evolution inferred from the observations may be largely due to the bias , and be compatible even with models that do not include effective quasar feedback .",
    "decarli ( 2010b ) performed a more empirically  based estimate of the lauer bias expected in their data and found it to be negligible with respect to the observed evolution .",
    "the extent of the lauer bias depends on the luminosity / mass function of galaxies and of super - massive black holes , on the scatter of the intrinsic relation and on its evolution with redshift ( lauer 2007 ) . for the sam considered here",
    ", there is evidence ( see section[sect : qsomassfunc ] ) that the models underestimate the number of massive quasars at high @xmath11 ; consequently , the lauer bias in the sam is probably exhacerbated and `` shifted '' at proportionally too low bh masses .",
    "nontheless , our results show that it is an important ingredient in the interpretation of the data , and the global approach provided by sam is needed to interpret the properties of quasar host samples .",
    "the bh mass  host mass relation is physically more meaningful , yet the most direct comparison between models and data is for the bh mass  host luminosity relation .",
    "observationally , in fact , we measure the luminosity of detected quasar host galaxies .",
    "their stellar mass is then derived indirectly , typically assuming that the host is a spheroidal galaxy evolving passively since a higher formation redshift ( peng 2006 ; kotilainen 2009 ; decarli 2010b ) .",
    "this is a quite different picture from the `` young spheroid '' scenario of theoretical models .",
    "further differences in the adopted stellar initial mass function ( imf ) can easily introduce systematic offsets up to 0.3  dex in the @xmath55 ratio ( bell & de jong 2001 ; portinari 2004 ) .",

    "quasar host galaxies are a fair sample of the global galaxy populations : having suffered a recent merger with associated starburst , they tend to be overluminous and bluer than average .",
    "indeed at low redshifts , quasar hosts in the sam are systematically brighter by about 0.5  mag , at a given bh mass . at higher redshifts however ( @xmath63 ) , due to the younger age and more intense star formation activity of the galaxy population at large , the offset between the two populations tends to vanish .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbh_mrhost_all ] , we see that at low @xmath11 the median relation for the global galaxy population ( thick solid line tracing the dotted contours ) agrees with the relation observed in the local universe ( this straight line ) , while departing from it at higher redshift .",

    "even considering that the normalization of the measured bh masses is somewhat arbitrary , depending on the assumed geometry of the broad line regions , one can hardly reconcile model predictions with the data : the minimum bh masses , corresponding to the isotropic case , would be systematically lower by 0.5  dex than the normalization adopted by decarli ( 2010a ) ; but a disc  like geometry is favoured by a number of arguments ( decarli 2008ab ; graham et  al .",

    "this effect was discussed by shen & kelly ( 2010 ; see also shen 2008 ; kelly 2009 ) : observational errors on measured bh masses , combined with the steep end of the bh mass function , introduce a malmquist  type bias that skewes the sample toward much larger apparent bh masses",
    ". we shall refer to this as the shen  kelly bias .",
    "an analogous malmquist  type bias at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function has proved to help to account for the stellar mass function of high @xmath11 galaxies in the hierarchical scenario ( fontanot 2009 , and references therein ) .    the evolution of the bh mass  luminosity relation , in terms of brightening with redshift at given bh mass , is illustrated in fig .",

    "we show the results after error convolution : while the evolution of objects around @xmath67  @xmath7  is marginally affected , the scenario drastically changes at the high mass end : for ( apparent ) bh masses of @xmath68  @xmath7 , sam are consistent with no evolution within the errors , and become compatible with observational results .",

    "notice that both biases , acting at the massive / luminous end , produce a steepening in the slope of the bh mass  host luminosity ( or host mass ) relation : the apparent slope is about 1.5  dex / mag .",
    "future observational investigations of the apparent slope , extending to qsos of lower bh mass , will be a useful test for the models .",
    "in the previous sections , we have seen how statistical biases dominate the interpretation of the observed evolution of the bh mass  host relation . even with the `` aid '' of bias effects , though , fig .",
    "[ fig : mbh_mrhost_obs ] suggests that the sam hardly reach the most massive bh observed in the high redshift samples . since the extent of the biases strongly depends on the luminosity / mass function of galaxies and bh at the high mass end , we discuss in this section the observational constraints on the mass function of qso s .",
    "in particular , we consider whether the lack of massive bh in the sam is just a statistical limit , simply due to the fact that very massive quasars are too rare objects to be included in the simulation volume .",
    "the millennium simulation follows a comoving box of size 500  @xmath69=685  mpc ; from the mass function of quasars ( vestergaard & osmer 2009 ) , in such a volume we expect about 10 active nuclei with @xmath70  @xmath7  at redshift @xmath71 , while none is obtained in the simulations  not only considering the selected quasar host galaxies , but even in the global galaxy population . the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : vester ] shows the number of expected active nuclei as a function of mass and redshift ( thick histogram ) , compared to those obtained in the sam .",
    "the excess of low mass qsos in the sam might depend on the details of our selection criterion , or to the incompleteness of the observed qso mass function below @xmath72  @xmath7  ( kelly 2010 ) .",
    "more important for us here is the clear lack of quasars more massive than @xmath72  @xmath7  at high redshift , independent of our selection criteria  as it is confirmed looking at the global galaxy population .",
    "this dearth of massive black holes at high @xmath11 may be due to an intrinsic difficulty of hierarchical models to form massive objects at high redshift , or may demand a specific recipe for the formation of the most massive , rare bh .",
    "marulli ( 2008 ) noticed an analogous mismatch with the bright end of the agn luminosity function at @xmath73 , and suggest that an accretion efficiency increasing with redshift may cure the problem ( see also bonoli 2009 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how the new prescription would impact the evolution of the scaling relations and the lauer and shen  kelly bias in the munich sam .",
    "both biases are strongest at the high mass / luminosity end , therefore a bh mass function depleted already at @xmath48  @xmath7  probably corresponds to an enhanced bias at that bh mass .",
    "however , here also we must convolve model predictions with realistic observational errors . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vester ] we show the results after convolving model bh masses with a lognormal error distribution of 0.4  dex standard deviation , similar to that adopted in section  [ sect : hostlum ] .",
    "the comparison with the observed mass function at the high mass end is improved , yet not satisfactory : the problem of undermassive bh persists , at least above @xmath74  @xmath7 .",
    "( notice that no error convolution is considered on the dot  with  arrow , i.e.  on the most massive bh actually formed in the simulation ; this highlights how the shen  kelly bias on qso hosts can produce even higher bh masses , than actually existing in the whole simulated volume . )",
    "however , if typical errors as large as 0.55  dex are allowed for the virial technique ( vestergaard & osmer 2009 ; vestergaard 2010 ; but see also kelly 2010 , favouring smaller uncertainties ) , the discrepancy between sam and observed mass function is much reduced ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : vester ] ) . especially relaxing the `` doubling '' criterion on bh masses for the selection of qso hosts ( see section  [ sect : selection ] ; dotted histogram ) and taking into account that cosmic variance is typically 23 times poisson noise .",
    "all things considered , there is some evidence for a lack of massive bh in simulated qso hosts , but it is not compelling once observational errors are included . a deeper investigation on this issue would require a detailed simulation of the qso light curves and luminosities , so as to extract from the sam a sample of objects mimicking closely the observational selection .",
    "finally we remark that , while the shen  kelly bias depends only on the bh mass function and the uncertainties on measured bh masses , the lauer bias is also sensitive to the luminosity function of galaxies : a paucity of simulated luminous , massive galaxies at high redshift would also enhance this bias . in this respect ,",
    "we notice that the long  standing difficulty of most sam with the k  band galaxy luminosity function at early epochs , seems to be now overcome thanks to improved treatment of the critical agb phase in population synthesis models ( henriques 2011 ) .",
    "qso host galaxies at high redshift are important tracers of the co  evolution of galaxies and black holes . taking advantage of recent datasets extending out to @xmath4 ,",
    "we have studied how the observed evolution of the bh  host scaling relations compares to theoretical semi ",
    "analytical models ; we considered specifically the publicly available sam of the munich group ( de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) .",
    "while at @xmath3 the scaling relations are established for the general galaxy population , at high @xmath11 bh masses can be only derived for active nuclei by means of the virial technique .",
    "this introduces a number of potential biases , to be taken into account when discussing the evolution of the scaling relations .    1 .",
    "quasar host galaxies are in a peculiar phase of their evolution : in the theoretical scenario considered here , they are `` young spheroids '' that have just merged and suffered a starburst .",
    "our analysis highlights the distinction between the general population and the recent mergers / quasar hosts .",
    "2 .   at high redshift",
    "it is hard to decompose the host galaxy into its bulge / disc component so the scaling relations we analyze refer to the global galaxy ; yet , for consistency with observational papers , evolution is defined with respect to the local relations derived for quiescent host spheroids .",
    "3 .   luminous quasars tend to trace over  massive bh with respect to the underlying intrinsic bh ",
    "host relation ( lauer 2007 ) , so the comparison relation in the models must be defined accordingly .",
    "4 .   the observational errors on bh masses introduce a malmquist  type bias ( shen & kelly 2010 ) that also must be taken into account , by convolving model prediction with observational errors before direct comparison to the data .",
    "we find that the latter two bias effects dominate the interpretation of the observational results . in the munich sam ,",
    "two basic predictions are : ( i ) the intrinsic ( bisector  fit ) relation between bh mass and host stellar mass has negligible evolution out to @xmath4  as typical of models that do not include quasar feedback and self  regulation mechanisms ; ( ii ) quasar host galaxies are systematically overluminous ( and/or have systematically undermassive black holes ) with respect to the local bh mass  host luminosity relation",
    ". both predictions , taken at face value , are in stark contrast with observations .",
    "however , the lauer bias in the sam produces an apparent evolution of 0.6  dex out to @xmath4 , for the host stellar mass of black holes with @xmath75  @xmath7(the typical bh masses probed by high redshift qsos ) : this is comparable to the observed evolution of @xmath5 ( section  [ sect : hostmass ] ) . besides , when observations and models are directly compared in the bh mass  host luminosity plane , and models are properly convolved with observational errors , the shen  kelly bias compensates for the intrinsic overluminosity of sam quasar hosts , bringing the models into agreement with the observations ( section  [ sect : hostlum ] ) .",
    "we thus find that the observed strong evolution , with bh formation preceding the growth of the hosts , could be largely the result of statistical and selection biases , compatible with negligible real evolution of the intrinsic bh mass  host mass relation ; this agrees with the conclusion of shen & kelly ( 2010 ) . whether a strong @xmath5 evolution really characterizes the general co  evolution of bh and galaxies , is therefore still unclear .",
    "we note , for instance , that sub - mm galaxies tend to trace the opposite trend ( @xmath5 decreasing at high @xmath11 ) , which can be understood if different selection biases apply to different sub ",
    "populations of galaxies ( lamastra 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "since biases dominate the interpretation of the results , it is of paramount importance to ascertain that sam predict realistic biases .",
    "as both the lauer and the shen  kelly bias are related to the fact that high@xmath11 quasars trace the massive / bright end of the bh and galaxy distribution functions , sam should reproduce these adequately at various redshifts .",
    "while the situation for the galaxy luminosity function is nowadays satisfactory ( henriques 2011 ) , there is evidence that the munich sam fail at reproducing the high mass end of the bh mass function at early epochs .",
    "indications for this come from the bright end of the agn luminosity function at @xmath73 ( marulli 2008 ) and from the mass function of high@xmath11 qsos ( section  [ sect : qsomassfunc ] ) ; though this latter evidence is less compelling , if an error on observed bh masses as large as 0.55  dex is allowed and cosmic scatter is considered .",
    "a deeper investigation on this issue requires more detailed modelling of the bh accretion history and qso luminosity curves , so as to extract from the sam catalogue qso samples that closely mimic the observational datasets .",
    "a dearth of massive black holes ( @xmath76  @xmath7 ) in the simulated volume may be due to a general difficulty of hierarchical galaxy formation models to produce massive objects at high redshift , or to the fact that these massive black holes are so rare ( e.g.  decarli 2010b ) that a separate , specific scenario is required to implement their formation in sam .",
    "alternative mechanisms of bh formation in the very high redshift universe , advocated to account for the rarest , most massive quasars at @xmath77 ( e.g.  mayer 2010 , and references therein ) may indeed help also to improve on the statistics of massive quasars at @xmath11=3 and below .",
    "progress in the interpretation of high redshift data also requires a better understanding of the biases in the real universe .",
    "both the lauer bias and the shen  kelly bias act at the high end of the bh mass function , producing a steepening of the apparent bh mass  host relation with respect to the intrinsic one . both effects",
    "are predicted to vanish around @xmath78  @xmath7 , and to be present also at low redshifts .",
    "therefore , assuming evolution to be negligible at relatively low redshifts , comparing the relation for the local galaxy population to that for agn hosts , can constraint the actual biases .",
    "also extending high  redshift samples to lower bh masses would be valuable .",
    "in summary , the interpretation of the properties of quasar hosts involves a full account of the statistical properties ( luminosity / mass functions ) of both galaxies and quasars : on one hand quasar hosts are useful tests for sam , on the other hand we need the global approach of sam to properly interpret the data .",
    "the sam considered here , although not adequately reproducing the agn population , can still recover the observed trend of @xmath53 in quasar host galaxies , when selection biases are included ; and suggests that the underlying @xmath5 evolution for the general galaxy population , may be much milder .",
    "it will be worthwhile to reconsider the role of biases at the massive end of the bh populations , in the context of sam that better account for the properties of the quasar population .",
    "the available observational datasets at present consist of a relatively small number of objects , but larger samples are expected to become available in the near future , based on high resolution observations with the next generation of 3050  mt .",
    "we conclude with a `` wish  list '' for future semi  analytical studies , to fully exploit the potential of quasar hosts galaxy observations to constrain the co  evolution of bh and galaxies .",
    "* sam should include the modelling of the quasar accretion rate and light curve , so as to predict the properties of galaxies and the bh  host relations _ specifically during the phase of optical quasar activity _ , as in kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) . * in analyzing the co  evolution of the bh mass and its host",
    ", a clear distinction should be made between intrinsic ( bi  sector fit ) relation and median relation at a given bh mass .",
    "the latter is affected by the lauer bias , whose effects should be assessed separately .",
    "error convolution , including the shen  kelly bias , is another mandatory step .",
    "* besides the @xmath79 relation , sam should provide predictions on the @xmath80 relation , which allows a more fair and self  consistent comparison to the observations .",
    "effort is particularly required to reproduce properly the mass / luminosity function of quasars at high redshift at the massive end : due to the importance of statistical biases , this is a crucial pre - requisite to our understanding of the co  evolution of bh and galaxies as traced by quasar hosts .",

    "the observed luminosities of quasar host galaxies are to be translated into stellar mass , in order to recover the underlying bh mass  host mass relation to be compared to the local one . in this appendix",
    "we discuss the stellar mass  to  light ratio ( @xmath55 ) necessary for the transformation .",
    "a passively evolving starburst formed at @xmath81 well describes the observed dimming of quasar hosts ( kotilainen 2009 ) and was consequently assumed by decarli ( 2010b ) to convert luminosities to stellar masses .",
    "similar assumptions were made by peng ( 2006 ) .",
    "let us compare the colour and @xmath55 evolution predicted by the sam , to the classic assumption of passive evolution .",
    "sam galaxies are expected to be bluer and have lower @xmath55 than a passively evolving galaxy , since in a hierarchical universe galaxies build up progressively and are on average younger than in the monolithic scenario .",
    "quasar hosts , selected to be recently merged objects with associated starbursts , should deviate even further from passive evolution .",

    "there is a significant offset in colour between the global average galaxy population and the quasar hosts , that are systematically bluer by about 0.4 mag due to merger  induced recent star formation . at increasing redshift the offset decreases , as the global population gets on average bluer , faster than the quasar hosts ; by @xmath4 , the offset is reduced to @xmath840.2  mag , corresponding to only @xmath85 difference between the two populations .",

    "interestingly , the rate of @xmath86 evolution of the sam galaxies is very similar to the passively evolving scenario ; the offset of 0.3  dex can be partly ascribed to the different stellar imf adopted ( salpeter 1955 for passive evolution , chabrier 2003 for the sam galaxies ) ; and partly to the fact that sam galaxies are significantly bluer than a purely passively evolving galaxy ( fig .",

    "as the _ rate _ of luminosity evolution is similar in the various scenarios , the result of decarli ( 2010b ) that quasar hosts were significantly undermassive at high redshift does not strongly depend on the passive evolution assumption .",
    "actually , adopting the lighter @xmath55 ratios predicted by the sam would only strengthen their findings , with central bh being even more overmassive , by a further 0.30.5  dex , with respect to their hosts .    the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlrevol ] also highlights that a complex galaxy formation history may easily mimic a passively evolving case when viewed in a monochromatic band . , brightens with redshift following the passive evolution of a high  redshift starburst , so as to apprently trace a population of ellipticals formed at @xmath8 .",
    "however , when the authors consider the decrease in number density of bright galaxies beyond @xmath88 , and the evolution of the red and blue populations separately , the apparent passive fading of @xmath89 clearly hides a much more complex galaxy evolution history . ]",
    "a possible way to distinguish a truly passively evolving population from a merger scenario is to use colour information ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b - rcolour ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , multi  band information on quasar hosts at high @xmath11 is still scarse and mostly limited to @xmath90 ( jahnke 2009 ; bennert 2011 ) . moreover , since the host luminosity and colors have typical uncertainty of 0.3  mag one can hardly discriminate between the two scenarios beyond @xmath91 .    as to the adopted imf for the @xmath55 normalization , most recent theoretical models of galaxy formation adopt the `` bottom  light '' chabrier ( 2003 ) prescription ; however , for the most massive ellipticals that presently host the most massive bh  analogous to those traced by high redshift qso  recent results suggest that a salpeter , or even `` heavier '' imf , may be more appropriate ( treu 2010 ; thomas 2011 ; van dokkum & conroy 2010 , 2011 ; tiret 2011 ) .",
