    "a framing for a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 is a smooth choice of ordered basis @xmath2 for the tangent space at each point of @xmath1 .",
    "a _ projective _ framing is a smooth choice of a _ pair _ of bases of the form @xmath3 .",
    "it has long been established that any orientable 3-manifold admits a framing ( s ) and any non - orientable 3-manifold admits a projective framing ( hh ) .",
    "the original proofs rely on the notion of characteristic classes .",
    "we present a proof for compact @xmath1 , which will only use basic facts about immersions of surfaces in 3-space .",
    "we now present the facts on immersions that we will need .",
    "denote @xmath4 , which is a cyclic group of order 4 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote an annulus or mobius band .",
    "there are two regular homotopy classes of immersions of @xmath5 into @xmath6 .",
    "to each such class we attach a value in @xmath7 as follows : for @xmath5 an annulus , the regular homotopy class of immersions which includes an embedding whose image is @xmath8 { \\subseteq}{{\\bbb r}}^2 \\times { { \\bbb r}}= { { { \\bbb r}^3}}$ ] , will have value @xmath9 .",
    "the other class , ( containing an embedding differing from the previous embedding by one full twist ) will have value @xmath10 . for @xmath5 a mobius band we attach once and for all the value @xmath11 to one of the classes and the value @xmath12 to the other ( which again differ from the previous by one full twist ) .",
    "now let @xmath13 be a closed surface and @xmath14 an immersion .",
    "we define a map @xmath15 as follows : given @xmath16 let @xmath17 be an embedded circle which represents @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a thin neighborhood of @xmath19 in @xmath13 , then @xmath5 is an annulus or mobius band .",
    "we define @xmath20 to be the value in @xmath7 attached above to the immersion @xmath21 .",
    "it has been shown in p that @xmath22 is indeed well defined on @xmath23 and satisfies the following property : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the intersection form on @xmath23 .",
    "note @xmath26 .",
    "we remark that the notation in p differs from ours in that @xmath7 is taken there to be @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 .",
    "and so the numerical value of @xmath22 appearing there is twice the value here , and our property ( fp ) appearing above is replaced there by @xmath29 .",
    "we point out that the above facts about immersions are indeed basic , in the sense that they may be obtained without knowledge of the smale - hirsch theorem .",
    "e.g. for the classification of regular homotopy classes of immersions of @xmath5 into @xmath6 where @xmath5 is an annulus or mobius band , one needs to show that the easily constructed map into @xmath30 is bijective . in general",
    "one would use the smale - hirsch theorem , but in this case surjectivity follows by direct construction of the two immersions , and injectivity follows by familiarity with the `` belt trick '' .",
    "we will prove the statement for @xmath1 a closed 3-manifold .",
    "the statement for @xmath1 with boundary will follow by restricting a framing from the double of @xmath1 .",
    "so let @xmath1 be a closed 3-manifold , and let @xmath31 be a heegard surface , i.e. @xmath13 splits @xmath1 into two handlebodies @xmath32 ( orientable or non - orientable ) with common boundary @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a system of disjoint circles which may be compressed in @xmath34 , reducing @xmath34 to a ball , and let @xmath35 be such system compressible in @xmath36 .",
    "then a thin neighborhood @xmath5 of each of the @xmath37s and @xmath38s is an annulus .",
    "if @xmath1 is orientable then embed @xmath34 into @xmath6 as in figure f1a .",
    "this induces an embedding @xmath14 as its boundary .",
    "if @xmath1 is non - orientable , then take an immersion @xmath39 into @xmath6 as in figure f1b . in both cases we have @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "( we allow @xmath37 to denote both the circle in @xmath13 and its homology class in @xmath23 . )      for any diffeomorphism @xmath42 , define @xmath44 by @xmath45 .",
    "note that indeed @xmath46 and by ( fp ) @xmath47 is a linear functional .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the dehn twist along @xmath37 , then the induced homomorphism @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 .",
    "we get ( by ( fp ) ) for all @xmath16 : @xmath51 let @xmath52 be the subspaces spanned by the @xmath37s and @xmath38s respectively , then the intersection form vanishes on @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it follows by ( fp ) that @xmath55 is identically 0 and @xmath56 is a @xmath57 valued linear functional . by ( e2 ) @xmath53 is contained in the kernel of each @xmath58 and since the intersection form is non - degenerate on @xmath23 , @xmath59 span all linear functionals on @xmath23 which vanish on @xmath53 . in particular , they span a linear functional @xmath60 vanishing on @xmath53 and satisfying @xmath61 .",
    "now let @xmath62 be the composition of dehn twists along those @xmath37s participating in the presentation of @xmath60 as linear combination of @xmath59 , then @xmath63 and so for all @xmath41 : @xmath64 .",
    "we now change the gluing between @xmath34 and @xmath36 using the @xmath42 given by lemma dhn .",
    "this does not change the diffeomorphism type of @xmath1 since dehn twists along the @xmath37s may be extended to @xmath34 . after this change of gluing we have that @xmath65 for all @xmath41 , and still @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "we will first construct a ( projective ) framing on @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 denote the tangent spaces of @xmath13 and @xmath1 at @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the unit vector normal to @xmath70 and pointing away from @xmath34 .",
    "( assume we have chosen a riemannian metric on @xmath1 . )",
    "if @xmath1 is orientable then there is well defined a unit normal @xmath71 at @xmath72 pointing away from the embedding of @xmath34 . and",
    "so @xmath73 together with the choice of normals @xmath74 and @xmath71 induce an isomorphism of @xmath75 with @xmath76 , with which we pull back the standard framing of @xmath76 to @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath1 is non - orientable then a normal to @xmath77 may not be well chosen .",
    "let @xmath71 be one of the two unit normals .",
    "we define the isomorphism from @xmath75 to @xmath76 using this @xmath71 , and pull back the frame in @xmath76 which is obtained from the standard frame by rotating it by @xmath78 around @xmath71 in the positive sense defined by the direction of @xmath71 .",
    "when choosing the opposite @xmath71 , then the isomorphism will differ by the reflection defined by @xmath71 , and the frame we pull back from @xmath6 will differ by a @xmath79 rotation around @xmath71 , and so altogether the frame induced in @xmath75 will differ by @xmath80 .",
    "so such pull back defines a projective framing on @xmath66 .    the next step is to extend the framing to a thin neighborhood of the compressing discs of the @xmath37s and @xmath38s in @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath19 be one of the circles @xmath37 or @xmath38 and let @xmath5 be a thin neighborhood of @xmath19 in @xmath13 , then @xmath5 is an annulus , and since @xmath81 , there is a regular homotopy @xmath82 , @xmath83 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 an embedding with image @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes @xmath88 $ ] . let @xmath89 be a neighborhood of the compressing disc of @xmath19 in @xmath34 or @xmath36 , so @xmath90 where @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath91",
    ". for @xmath92 let @xmath93 denote @xmath94 where @xmath95 are respectively the disc and circle of radius @xmath96 in @xmath97 .",
    "for any @xmath98 take @xmath74 to be the unit normal to @xmath99 pointing inward in @xmath89 . now",
    "if @xmath1 is orientable then we follow the increasing time @xmath83 of our regular homotopy @xmath100 with decreasing radius from @xmath101 to @xmath102 in @xmath97 , and pull back the standard framing of @xmath6 to any point @xmath103 as before , using the normal @xmath74 , and normal @xmath71 to the image of the immersion in @xmath6 , where the side of the normal is chosen at time 0 to be pointing outward from the embedding of @xmath34 .",
    "this extends the framing we have constructed in @xmath13 . at @xmath104 we have an embedding of @xmath105 as @xmath106 , and by additional regular homotopy if necessary we may assume the normals @xmath71 are pointing inward .",
    "this extends to an embedding of @xmath107 onto @xmath108 .",
    "now if the metric on @xmath1 is chosen so that this embedding of @xmath107 into @xmath6 is isometric , then the pull back of the standard framing of @xmath6 to @xmath105 that we have , coincides with the one induced by this embedding of @xmath107 , and so the framing can be extended to the whole of @xmath109 .",
    "this completes the construction of the framing in @xmath89 .",
    "we now only need to extend the framing to the remaining 3-balls in @xmath34 and @xmath36 , but this may always be done ( e.g. since @xmath110 ) .",
    "this completes the proof for the case @xmath1 is orientable .    for non - orientable @xmath1",
    "we argue as follows : since @xmath5 is an annulus , it is orientable and so we may choose a unit normal @xmath71 in @xmath6 along @xmath111 . from the projective framing we have defined along @xmath13 select the proper ( i.e. non - projective ) framing determined above by this choice of @xmath71 .",
    "we will extend this to a proper framing on @xmath89 as in the orientable case , only that now the framing in @xmath89 will be defined in three layers , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 . in the outer layer we will realize a rotation of the framing around @xmath71 in the negative sense , until we have the actual pull back of the framing in @xmath6 .",
    "then the middle and inner layers will be defined as in the orientable case , using a regular homotopy of @xmath5 to a standard annulus in @xmath6 .",
    "again we may complete the framing to the remaining balls in @xmath32 since once we have a projective framing on the boundary of such ball , we may select a proper framing from it ( since the ball is orientable ) , and then extend the framing to the ball as before ."
