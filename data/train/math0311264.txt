    "the natural action of the symmetric group @xmath16 on @xmath17 gives rise to a rank - preserving , order - preserving action on the lattice @xmath18 of partitions of @xmath19 ordered by refinement .",
    "the resulting @xmath16-action permuting chains of comparable poset elements yields an @xmath16-representation on the top homology of the order complex of the partition lattice .",
    "we study the multiplicity @xmath0 of the trivial representation in the representation @xmath20 of the symmetric group @xmath16 on the homology of the partition lattice @xmath21 restricted to rank set @xmath3 for various @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "questions about these multiplicities were first suggested in [ st1 ] and studied quite extensively , using symmetric functions , in [ su ] .",
    "we approach these questions from two other angles : spectral sequences of filtered complexes and partitioning of quotient complexes .",
    "a partitioning of the quotient complex @xmath23 lends itself well to proving lower bounds on @xmath0 , while spectral sequences of filtered complexes seem well - suited to giving upper bounds .",
    "one of our interests is finding cases where we can get the two bounds to meet and seeing how the two very different methods make use of the same information .",
    "in particular , we give results about when @xmath0 is positive and when it is 0 ( as well as when a related multiplicity @xmath24 is positive ) , including proofs of two conjectures of sundaram [ su ] .",
    "recall that the * order complex * @xmath25 of a finite poset @xmath26 with minimal and maximal elements @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the simplicial complex comprised of an @xmath29-face for each chain @xmath30 of comparable poset elements .",
    "whenever a group @xmath31 acts on a graded poset @xmath26 in a rank - preserving , order - preserving fashion , the group also permutes the poset chains , or equivalently the faces in its order complex .",
    "this @xmath31-action on @xmath25 commutes with the boundary map , so the action on chains also gives rise to a @xmath31-representation on each of the homology groups of @xmath25 .",
    "the action on chains also may be restricted to any rank set @xmath3 giving rise to a group representation @xmath32 permuting the chains of support @xmath3 and to representations on the homology of @xmath25 restricted to rank set @xmath3 .",
    "we will be interested in the alternating sum @xmath33 of @xmath16-representations @xmath34 on chains .",
    "when @xmath26 is a cohen - macaulay poset , then @xmath25 ( and each of its rank - selected subcomplexes ) only has top homology , in which case @xmath20 is the @xmath31-representation on the top homology group in the rank - selected complex @xmath35 obtained by restricting @xmath36 to rank set @xmath3 .",
    "the partition lattice is a cohen - macaulay poset , and we will be interested in the multiplicity @xmath0 of the trivial representation in @xmath37 .",
    "our results about when @xmath0 is positive come out of an analysis of the flag @xmath38-vectors of the quotient complex @xmath11 , defined as follows :    the * flag @xmath39-vector * of a @xmath40-dimensional balanced simplicial complex @xmath36 is a vector with coordinates @xmath41 for each subset @xmath42 of the set of vertex colors for @xmath36 where @xmath41 counts how many faces in @xmath36 have vertices colored exactly by @xmath3 .",
    "the * flag @xmath38-vector * is the alternating sum @xmath43 , or alternatively , @xmath44 .",
    "see [ st2 ] for more background .    in our case ,",
    "the vertices of @xmath45 are colored by poset rank , and @xmath45 is balanced because no two elements of a chain have the same rank , implying no two vertices in the same face in @xmath45 are assigned the same color .",
    "the quotient complex @xmath46 consists of the @xmath31-orbits of faces in @xmath25 , and it inherits the balancing by poset rank from @xmath25 when @xmath26 is graded and @xmath31 preserves rank . note that @xmath46 typically is not the same as the order complex @xmath47 of the quotient poset , and in particular @xmath48 ; there are elements @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for @xmath51 but @xmath52 is not in the same @xmath31-orbit as @xmath53 .",
    "the quotient complex often is not a simplicial complex , but it is always a boolean cell complex , i.e. a regular cell complex in which each cell has the combinatorial type of a simplex .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath54 of the trivial representation within the group action @xmath32 on chains of support @xmath3 equals the number of orbits in the action @xmath32 , i.e. it equals @xmath55 . as observed in [ re ] , this implies that @xmath56 hence , we will study flag @xmath38-vectors of quotient complexes as a way of getting at @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , we will use the fact that when a balanced complex @xmath36 is shellable or partitionable , then @xmath58 counts minimal faces of support @xmath3 in the shelling or partitioning .",
    "a pure simplicial complex @xmath36 is * partitionable * if the set of faces may be partitioned into a direct sum @xmath59\\cup\\cdots\\cup [ g_k , f_k]\\ ] ] of intervals of boolean type where @xmath60 are the facets of @xmath36 and @xmath61 is a face of @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the complex @xmath36 is * shellable * if the facets may be ordered @xmath60 so that for @xmath64 , the set @xmath65 of faces belonging to @xmath66 but not to any earlier facet , has a unique minimal element @xmath67 .",
    "thus , a shelling may be viewed as a type of partitioning .",
    "further background may be found in [ st2 ] .",
    "we will use a very complicated partitioning for @xmath11 given in [ he ] to show @xmath12 for various classes of @xmath3 by exhibiting facets @xmath62 with minimal faces @xmath61 of support @xmath3 . the partitioning for @xmath11",
    "has the property that for a very large class of facets @xmath62 , the minimal faces @xmath61 may be described in terms of a generalized notion of ascents and descents in a chain - labeling on orbits of saturated chains in @xmath68 .",
    "our strategy is to construct facets achieving various descent sets @xmath3 to show that @xmath12 for these rank sets @xmath3 .",
    "denote by @xmath2 the rank - selected subposet of the partition lattice consisting of those poset elements of rank @xmath69 for some @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "we show in section 3 that @xmath71 for nearly all other @xmath3 by using spectral sequences to prove that the trivial - isotypic piece of @xmath72 vanishes .",
    "the middle ground that is not covered by our results seems fairly subtle .",
    "section 4 generalizes the partitioning of @xmath73 to @xmath74 in order to prove a second conjecture of sundaram , regarding representations of @xmath15 on homology .",
    "in sections 2 and 4 , we will study the flag @xmath38-vector for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , using partitionings which express flag @xmath38-vector coordinates in terms of ascents and descents in a chain - labeling for orbits of saturated chains in the dual poset ; this virtually necessitates the use of ranks in the dual poset within these proofs , despite the fact that related results and conjectures of sundaram and our own spectral sequence arguments are phrased in terms of the ranks of @xmath18 instead of @xmath77 . in an effort to minimize confusion in converting back and forth between the rank sets for the partition lattice and its dual",
    ", we will denote by @xmath78 the rank set in @xmath77 which translates to rank set @xmath3 in @xmath18 ( or equivalently to corank set @xmath78 in @xmath18 ) .",
    "for the sake of consistency , the statements of all results will be in terms of rank sets @xmath3 ; however , all of the proofs in sections 2 and 4 ( as well as theorem 3.1 ) work internally with ascents and descents in the dual poset , so we systematically refer to rank sets @xmath78 inside these proofs .",
    "our arguments also may sometimes abuse notation by referring to chains when we always mean orbits of chains .",
    "let us depict the facets in @xmath79 ( namely the @xmath16-orbits of saturated chains in @xmath77 ) by diagrams consisting of @xmath80 balls with bars separating them ( or arrows indicating where these bars are to be inserted ) and the numbers from 1 to @xmath81 labeling the bars ( or the arrows ) .",
    "the bar labels indicate the ranks in @xmath77 ( or equivalently the coranks in @xmath21 ) at which the bars are inserted in the course of progressively refining a single block of @xmath80 objects into @xmath80 singleton blocks .",
    "the balls represent the numbers @xmath82 being partitioned , since we may freely permute these @xmath80 numbers without switching orbit .",
    "figure  [ sheila_even ] gives an example ( to be used again later ) which begins by refining a block of size 10 into children of sizes 2,8 and next refines the block of size 8 into children of sizes 2,6 .",
    "( 150,60)(0,0 )    each refinement step takes an ordered partition ( with the block ordering coming inductively from the choice of root for the chain orbit ) and splits one of its blocks into two smaller blocks by inserting a bar into the block .",
    "thus , we preserve the order of the original blocks and must only choose which of the two new blocks goes to the left of the other in the former position of the parent block .",
    "we make the convention of placing each bar as far to the left as possible among all choices that would give the same saturated chain orbit . in particular , placing a bar at position @xmath29 in a block of size @xmath80 is equivalent to placing the bar at position @xmath83 in that block , and we choose the position farther to the left .",
    "the other situation in which there is a choice to make is when there are equivalent blocks of the type to be split , in which case we refine the leftmost such block .",
    "this only happens if the blocks have the same size and were created from the same parent at the same step .",
    "the partitioning in [ he ] uses a chain - labeling in which each covering relation @xmath84 is labeled by a triple @xmath85 consisting of the position @xmath29 of the bar being inserted , the word @xmath86 recording the positions of all bars in @xmath87 and the rank @xmath69 at which the block being split at step @xmath84 was itself created . in [ he ]",
    ", there is also some sorting of equivalent blocks just prior to the labeling of each covering relation , but we may safely ignore this because our arguments based on the partitioning will only consider facets in which no sorting takes place ( or in a few cases ranks at which sorting does not occur within facets that do require sorting elsewhere ) .",
    "we say that a saturated chain orbit in @xmath77 has a * topological descent * at rank @xmath29 if the pair of covering relations @xmath84 and @xmath88 labeled @xmath85 and @xmath89 , respectively , satisfy any of the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the bar inserted by @xmath84 is farther to the right than the bar insertion from @xmath88 ( in which case @xmath90 , so the labels decrease ) ; 2 .",
    "the bar insertions @xmath84 and @xmath88 proceed from left to right splitting a single block of @xmath91 into three smaller blocks with the left child from the @xmath84 refinement strictly larger than the left child from the @xmath88 refinement step ; 3 .",
    "the bar insertions @xmath84 and @xmath88 refine a single block of @xmath91 into three children such that the left children resulting from the @xmath84 and @xmath88 covering relations both have size two and the latter gets refined to singletons before the former .",
    "all other ranks in the saturated chain orbit are called ( topological ) ascents . when the above chain - labeling is used to lexicographically order facets , the topological descents are the ranks which may be omitted from a facet to obtain codimension one faces that also belong to lexicographically earlier facets . for most facets @xmath62 , the ranks of the topological descents in @xmath77 are exactly the ranks included in the minimal face @xmath61 in the partitioning for @xmath79 , so our aim will be to find facets achieving various topological descent sets .",
    "to be more precise , the support of @xmath61 is exactly the ranks of the topological descents in @xmath62 if @xmath62 satisfies the nontrivial , non - equal block condition , as stated just prior to theorem 3.1 .",
    "we should remark that facets @xmath62 in @xmath73 violating the nontrivial , non - equal block condition have minimal faces @xmath61 whose support is not exactly the set of topological descents in @xmath62 , but our @xmath12 results only need to make use of facets which do satisfy the non - equal block condition ; when we give partitioning proofs of @xmath10 and @xmath92 results , we must consider all facets , but then we use the fact that even for facets @xmath66 violating the non - equal block condition , the ranks not involving equal blocks are in @xmath67 if and only if they are topological descent ranks .",
    "these ranks which are governed by descents are enough to show that these facets do not have minimal faces of support @xmath3 forbidden in the @xmath10 results and these ranks also suffice to set up the bijection needed in the new proof of stanley s @xmath92 result .",
    "let us represent the rank set @xmath93 by the word @xmath94 which has a @xmath95 ( for descent ) at each position @xmath96 and an @xmath97 ( for ascent ) at each of the remaining position .",
    "this reflects the fact that in a lexicographic shelling a saturated chain having descents at exactly the positions in @xmath78 would increase the value of the flag @xmath38-vector coordinate @xmath98 by one .",
    "now let us turn to the following two conjectures of sundaram [ su ] :    1 .   if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath101 be the multiplicity of the trivial representation in the representation of @xmath102 on homology of the rank - selected partition lattice @xmath2 . if @xmath103 then @xmath104 and otherwise @xmath105 .",
    "sundaram proved in [ su ] the first part of her second conjecture , namely that @xmath104 for @xmath106 .",
    "theorem 2.1 will confirm the first conjecture .",
    "we defer the proof of the second conjecture until section  [ otherlambda ] because it will rely on a partitioning for @xmath107 that is given in that section .",
    "theorem 2.1 is followed by a slight generalization , and then we give short new proofs based on partitioning for results of sundaram [ su ] and stanley [ st1 ] .",

    "figure  [ sheila_even ] gives an example for @xmath119 .",
    "note that the first @xmath120 pairs of consecutive bar insertions are topological descents because the codimension one face which skips from the bar insertion into position @xmath121 directly to partition with additional bars at positions @xmath122 also belongs to the lexicographically earlier facet which reverses the order ( later in the chain ) in which bars are inserted into positions @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
