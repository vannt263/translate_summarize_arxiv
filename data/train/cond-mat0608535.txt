    "extensive recent numerical investigations , done at finite @xmath11 @xcite , as well as ground state analysis @xcite , suggest evidence for a multiplicity of gibbs states in the low temperature phase of the 3disg .",
    "the most widely measured properties are @xmath12 the site overlap between any two microstates @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the _ global _ distribution of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and , in particular , @xmath17 , the distribution averaged over the random variables @xmath18 . in ( [ eqpq ] )",

    "there is general agreement that in 3disg the averaged distribution @xmath20 is not trivial ( that is , does not converge to a @xmath21-function in the infinite volume limit ) and is not self averaging , in agreement with rsb theory .    as to the droplet theory @xcite ,",
    "although its common interpretation involves a trivial @xmath20 @xcite , it explicitly predicts only the triviality of the _ local _ @xmath20 - the overlap distribution over a finite ( large ) window in an infinite system .",
    "that is , _ locally _ there is only one gibbs state for the system ( up to a spin - flip symmetry ) , so that when a finite window of an infinite system is viewed , the system will be almost always in this gibbs state .    in order to test this prediction numerically",
    ", one should observe the site overlap in a finite constant window as the system size increases @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to measure the link overlap @xmath22 summing over all the @xmath23 bonds in the system , e.g. over all nearest neighbors pairs in the case of 3disg .",
    "the distribution of the link overlap , @xmath24 , is defined similarly to @xmath25 in eq .",

    "newman and stein @xcite showed that triviality of @xmath0 for given boundary conditions may be deduced from general considerations even if one relaxes some of the scaling assumptions of the droplet theory .",
    "however , according to rsb @xmath0 is not trivial . unlike the case of @xmath20 ,",
    "the triviality of @xmath0 is still an open question @xcite .",
    "in the present work we analyze 3disg systems of sizes @xmath28 .",
    "we generated 65 realizations of the disorder , @xmath18 , for each system size .",
    "for each realization we produced a weighted sample of microstates .",
    "we used simulated tempering monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the number of temperatures , @xmath29 , and their values were determined so that in each inter - temperature step the transition probability is larger than 0.25 .",
    "we used @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 . the lowest and highest temperatures were @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for @xmath31 ) . for every realization",
    ", we took @xmath37 samples ( i.e. microstate - temperature pairs ) .",
    "we ran @xmath38 sweeps to thermalize the system , and the same number of sweeps between samples .    in most realizations the temperatures of consecutive samples",
    "were decorrelated , so that the system often went above @xmath9 , where it lost spin correlations .",
    "for some realizations the decorrelation times were as large as 10 sampling cycles .",
    "one approach used to study the link overlap is to measure the fractal dimension of the surface of low energy excitations @xcite .",
    "such studies are limited by the small system sizes available for numerical investigation .",
    "another approach is to calculate directly the moments of the link overlap distribution , @xmath0 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figvq ] we present @xmath39 , the second moment of @xmath0 . as the system size increases , the second moment decreases ( apparently towards zero ) at all temperatures , indicating that @xmath0 becomes trivial as @xmath40 .    ,",
    "for 3disg systems .",
    "the error bars are larger then the values of the variance . ]    however , characterization of the behavior of a distribution on the basis of a single parameter , such as a fractal dimension or a particular moment , may be misleading .",
    "this was demonstrated in ref .",
    "for the site overlap distribution , and the same holds for the link overlap distribution .",
    "the distribution @xmath41 , measured for a particular realization of the random @xmath18 , may consist of many modes , which correspond to different peaks in the graph of @xmath41 .",
    "each such mode is related to the distribution of overlaps between two given gibbs states .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the gibbs state with the highest statistical weight .    as temperature decreases the variation of the statistical weight of the gibbs states increases .",
    "in particular , the weight of @xmath42 approaches 1 as @xmath11 goes to zero . thus , at low temperatures the most dominant mode of @xmath41 is @xmath43 - the distribution of overlaps within @xmath42 - which is trivial in the thermodynamic limit . at small system sizes , as the ones considered in this work ,",
    "the peak of @xmath44 is still wide , and it narrows as @xmath45 increases . since even at finite ( albeit low ) temperatures @xmath44 dominates the distribution",
    ", one would expect a clear decrease of the variance of @xmath0 with size , as observed in fig .",
    "[ figvq ] , even if @xmath0 is non - trivial in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence decrease of the second moment of the distribution with size may capture nothing but the narrowing of the dominant single peak part of a non - trivial @xmath0 ; in order to test non - triviality , it is much more effective to measure the size dependence of a quantity which is independent of the dominant ( but uninformative ) @xmath46 .",
    "we present @xmath0 in fig . [",
    "figpq](a ) for two temperatures , one above and one below @xmath9 , for three system sizes . above @xmath9 , @xmath0 consists of a single peak which narrows as the @xmath45 increases ; , approaching @xmath47 .",
    "below @xmath9 the distribution consists of a dominant peak , whose main contribution comes from @xmath44 , and a tail at lower values of @xmath48 . as @xmath45 increases , the peak narrows and since the weight of the peak is much larger then that of the tail , a single measured parameter ( say moment ) may reflect mainly the convergence of the peak to a @xmath21 function , which is expected irrespective of whether @xmath0 is trivial or not . to address this question one has to assess whether the weight of the tail of @xmath0 , say , in the range @xmath49 , decreases with increasing system size .",
    "measured for 3disg systems at @xmath50 .",
    "the distribution converges to a @xmath21-peak .",
    "the grey lines above and below each curve indicate the error range . ]    , in linear plot and linear - log plot ( inset ) .",
    "( b ) the distribution @xmath51 for @xmath52 , which gives a finite contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "all distributions are normalized to unity .",
    "the grey lines above and below each curve indicate the error range . ]",
    "if @xmath0 is to have a non - trivial component at the thermodynamic limit , it must originate from pairs of microstates that belong to different gibbs states .",
    "ideally , we would like to calculate the link overlap distribution over all such pairs .",
    "in finite systems this is not possible since we can not identify the gibbs states unambiguously .",
    "however , the coarsest partitions of phase space _ can _ be observed clearly , even for very small systems @xcite .",
    "this partition consists of two sets of microstates , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which we identify by the _ average linkage _ agglomerative clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "the statistical weights of the sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 remain finite as the system size increases , and the average site overlap between them remains different from the overlap between two microstates that belong to the same set @xcite .",
    "therefore the contribution of the set of pairs of microstates @xmath55 to @xmath0 remains finite as the system size increases .    following the method described in ref .",
    "for @xmath20 , we define @xmath56 in order to move from a state in @xmath53 to a state in @xmath54 , some groups of spins ( domains ) have to be flipped .",
    "we refer to the surfaces that separate these flipped domains from spins that did not flip as domain walls .",
    "if these domain walls have a vanishing density , the fraction of links affected by switching one micro - state from @xmath53 to @xmath54 goes to zero as the system size increases , and hence at the thermodynamic limit we will have @xmath57 .    in fig .",
    "[ figpq](a ) we observe that for 3disg at @xmath52 , @xmath0 seems to converge to a peak at @xmath58 . if @xmath51 does not converge to the same distribution , we expect it to have a non - vanishing weight at @xmath59 .",
    "we calculate @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath28 the values of the integral are 0.81(5 ) , 0.83(4 ) , 0.80(4 ) respectively , suggesting that the weight of @xmath51 for @xmath61 does not decrease .",
    "thus , @xmath51 does not converge to the peak at @xmath58 which dominates @xmath0 .",
    "these results imply that the domain walls between @xmath53 and @xmath54 occupy a finite fraction of the volume of the system . since @xmath53 and @xmath54 remain finite and distinguishable as the system size increases @xcite , @xmath51 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figpq](b ) ) constitutes a finite contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 is not trivial at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "according to rsb theory , @xmath0 is not trivial .",
    "more over , all overlap measures are equivalent @xcite , so @xmath48 is determined by the value of the site overlap @xmath15 .",
    "this statement is trivial for the sk model , where the sum in eq .",
    "[ eqqab ] is over all pairs of sites , so @xmath62 . in 3disg",
    "the site overlap and bond overlap have different roles : given two states of the system , the site overlap is given by the volume of spin - domains flipped between the states , and the link overlap by the surface area of the domain walls .",
    "recent numerical investigation of 3disg systems @xcite indicated that the two overlaps are equivalent .",
    "this result along with previous numerical evidence for the non - triviality of the site overlap , @xmath20 , yield a non - trivial @xmath0 and support the results presented here ."
