    "the problem of pair creation from the qed vacuum by electromagnetic fields has been studied by various methods since the early days of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the application of the one - particle dirac equation leads to difficulties ( klein paradox ) because pair creation is obviously a many - body problem .",
    "all paradoxes are resolved when this process is described by quantum field theory .",
    "since pair creation by an external electromagnetic field involves quantum - mechanical tunneling , the process can not be described in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "some time ago we introduced in @xcite a formalism based on a generalization of the wigner function to quantum field theory .",
    "this allowed us to describe pair creation without resorting to perturbation theory .",
    "the basic tool in this formalism is the 16-component dirac - heisenberg - wigner ( dhw ) function .",
    "the formalism based on the dhw function was further developed in @xcite to yield quantum transport theory for relativistic spinning particles . in several papers",
    "@xcite a relativistic generalization of the wigner function was introduced . however , this approach is not suited for the solution of the initial value problem which is the main subject of this work .",
    "other methods were also developed to treat the problem of pair production @xcite but they have not led to an exact analytic solution .",
    "such a solution is especially useful since the dependence on the field strength of the pair density is described by a function with an essential singularity .    in the general case of space - dependent fields the evolution equations for the components of the dhw function form a set of complicated integro - differential equations .",
    "however , for a time - independent , uniform electric field these equations become tractable since , as shown in @xcite , they can be reduced to the following three equations for the relevant components of the dhw function ( notation is explained in the next section ) : @xmath0\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } 0&\\mathcal{e}/e_q^2&0\\\\-\\mathcal{e}/e_q^2&0&-2e_q\\\\0&2e_q&0\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c } a_0(q,\\tau)\\\\a_1(q,\\tau)\\\\a_2(q,\\tau)\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations were integrated numerically in @xcite and the schwinger formula @xcite for pair creation was obtained .",
    "recently , by an elaborate procedure a single solution of equations related to eqs .",
    "( [ orig ] ) was constructed as a combination of parabolic cylinder functions @xcite .",
    "this discovery stimulated our return to the study of pair production by a uniform electric field .",
    "in the present paper we construct not one but a complete set of solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ orig ] ) . with the use of these solutions",
    "we solve the initial value problem for these equations with arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "the initial conditions that interest us most are those of the qed vacuum and we describe the time evolution in this case .",
    "our solution clarifies the mechanism responsible for pair production and may explain some details of the vacuum decay studied recently @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ secevol ] we recall basic definitions and we derive a simplified form of the evolution equations ( [ orig ] ) best suited for our analysis . in sec .  [ secprec ] we exhibit the underlying @xmath1 symmetry that enabled us to express the solutions of the evolution equations in terms of spinors .",
    "the method of spinorial decomposition introduced in sec .",
    "[ secspin ] to lower the order of the differential equations by reducing the number of functions is quite general and might be applicable to a class of similar problems . finally , in sec .",

    "the dirac - heisenberg - wigner function @xmath2 for the quantized dirac field in an external electromagnetic field was defined in @xcite as follows : @xmath3\\right|\\phi\\right\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the square bracket denotes the commutator of the quantized dirac field operator @xmath4 with its hermitian conjugate and the phase @xmath5 is the line integral of the vector potential @xmath6 the commutator was introduced to make the dhw function invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "the phase factor ensures its gauge invariance and , as a result , the momentum variable @xmath7 is the kinetic momentum and not the gauge - dependent canonical momentum .",
    "the dhw matrix @xmath8 will be expanded into a set of dirac matrices , as was done in @xcite @xmath9 since the dhw matrix is hermitian , the expansion coefficients are all real functions .",
    "the dirac equations for the field operators lead to evolution equations for the dhw function @xmath10 that can be rewritten as 16 equations for the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .    for arbitrary electric @xmath14 and magnetic @xmath15 fields",
    "the evolution equations were derived in @xcite .",
    "here we shall need only a simple version of these equations valid for a time - independent , uniform electric field . since we will be concerned only with the time evolution of the initial vacuum state",
    ", it is sufficient to consider only ten , out of 16 , components of the dhw function that couple to the vacuum dhw function .",
    "the relevant components can be combined into a ten - dimensional vector @xmath16 and the evolution equations have the form : @xmath17 where we have taken into account that a uniform electric field does not introduce any space dependence .",

    "the derivative with respect to @xmath54 reproduces the right hand side of equations .",
    "second , we check that this expression satisfies the initial condition .",
    "this follows from the fact that at @xmath56 both arguments become equal and the product of the matrix and its inverse reduces to the unit matrix .    to make use of the formula ( [ init ] ) we must find a complete set of solutions of eq .",

    "the reduction of the set of three equations ( [ eqq ] ) to just one equation for a single function leads to a third - order equation .",

    "a representation of the solution of the resulting third - order equation in the form of a contour integral has been given by radoycki @xcite .",
    "the contour integral form was sufficient to obtain the schwinger formula .",
    "however , it can not serve as a basis for the solution of the initial value problem and we proceed by a different route .",
    "the key property is the presence of the @xmath1 symmetry in the equation ( [ eqq ] ) .",
    "indeed , this is an equation describing the precession in three - dimensional space of the vector @xmath57 around the vector @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath54 plays the role of time .",
    "the factor of 2 is pulled out for further convenience . were it not for the @xmath54-dependence of the precession vector @xmath58 , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ prec ] ) would have been very simple .",

    "this is a crucial simplification equations of the second - order are much more friendly than third - order equations .",
    "the technique of lowering the order of a differential equation by seeking the solution in the product form was known before for some third - order equations @xcite .",
    "here we extend it to a set of equations with an underlying symmetry group .",
    "for our choice of the precession vector we obtain from ( [ seq ] ) , @xmath65 where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the upper ( lower ) component @xmath66 of the spinor @xmath61 .",
    "these equations have parabolic cylinder functions as their solutions .",
    "of course , the solutions of the second - order equations must be chosen in such a way that the spinor @xmath61 is a solution of the original equations ( [ seq ] ) .",
    "there are several equivalent representations of the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ pcyl ] ) in terms of parabolic cylinder functions ( cf .",

    "owing to the minus sign in the definition ( [ three ] ) , the determinant of @xmath75 is equal to 1 ( it describes a pure rotation ) . the final formula for the vector @xmath80 that represents the solution of the initial value problem is @xmath81^t \\!\\cdot\\!{\\bm{\\mathcal{x}}}(q-\\mathcal{e}\\tau,0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath75 are expressed in terms of the parabolic cylinder functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 by the formula ( [ 3in2 ] ) .",
    "note that as compared with the general formula ( [ init ] ) we could replace the inverse matrix with the transposed matrix because we used an orthonormal set of solutions .",
    "the solution of the initial value problem ( [ initf ] ) can be used to evaluate the overlap @xmath82 between the dhw function evolved from the qed vacuum in time and the initial dhw function .",
    "this overlap is a simple measure of the departure from the initial state .",
    "it is given by the projection of the vector ( [ initf ] ) on the vector @xmath83 that describes the initial vacuum state . in this way",
    "we obtain the following compact formula for the overlap as a scalar product of two vectors , @xmath84 where @xmath85     as a function of the dimensionless momentum @xmath54 plotted at the values 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 of the dimensionless time @xmath86 .",
    "the dimensionless field strength @xmath87 is set to one . ]",
    "the overlap function , denoted by @xmath88 in @xcite , was obtained there by numerical integration of eqs .",
    "( [ orig ] ) .",
    "our analytic formulas reproduce exactly those results but instead of showing again the plots we shall transform the overlap function into a more intuitive characteristic  the density of pairs @xmath89 produced by the electric field . the relation between these two functions , as shown in @xcite by the calculation of the produced current , is very simple @xmath90 obviously , the number of pairs is small when the overlap function is close to unity . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the pair density as a function of @xmath54 for different values of @xmath86 .",
    "the pair density @xmath89 as a function of @xmath54 has a plateau in the middle region and some transient oscillations near @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the length of the plateau region grows with @xmath86 covering more and more of the @xmath54 axis .",
    "the plateau region reaches only as far as @xmath93 .",
    "this is an expression of causality because the largest momentum that could be acquired in time @xmath86 is @xmath93 .",
    "the departures at @xmath94 and @xmath92 from the plateau values can be explained as transient effects .",
    "the longer we apply the electric field , the less important is their role : they occupy a smaller and smaller fraction of the phase space .    in the limit , when @xmath95 , the pair density is totally dominated by the plateau .",
    "the height of the plateau at the mid point for @xmath96 has the value @xmath97 this height can be determined as a function of @xmath87 , in the limit when @xmath95 , from the asymptotic expansions of the parabolic cylinder functions ( [ pcf ] ) for large values of the argument .",
    "these expansions are different for @xmath98 and @xmath99 due to the stokes phenomenon .",
    "the role of the stokes phenomenon in pair production has been recently exposed in the context of the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "the leading terms in the asymptotic expansions are @xcite    [ as ] @xmath100    where the phases @xmath101 are @xmath102 now , let us note that for @xmath103 the vacuum vector ( [ vv ] ) reduces to @xmath104 . therefore , the vectors @xmath105 involve only those elements of the matrix ( [ 3in2 ] ) that form its bottom row .",
    "this observation leads to a particularly simple result for the positive values of @xmath54 . in this case , according to ( [ as1 ] ) and ( [ as2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath106 the calculation of @xmath107 is more involved , since the asymptotic formulas are more complicated .",
    "however , because @xmath108 has only one nonvanishing component , we only need the last component of the vector @xmath107 to calculate the scalar product ( [ qvv ] ) .",
    "this component is equal to @xmath109 , where we can substitute the asymptotic values given by ( [ as3 ] ) and ( [ as4 ] ) . with the use of the following identity for the euler @xmath110 function : @xmath111 we obtain finally @xmath112 it was shown before ( cf .",
    "( 69 ) , ( 72 ) , and ( 73 ) in @xcite ) that this value for the number of pairs , after integration over all momenta , leads to the schwinger formula @xcite .",
    "we have shown once more that the dhw function is a powerful tool to analyze quantum electrodynamic processes without recourse to perturbation theory .",
    "it is true that the evolution equations for this function , in general case , are prohibitively complicated .",
    "however , the case of the time - independent , uniform electric field treated here allows for the complete analytic solution of the initial value problem . our derivation of the analytic solution may also be viewed as a case study to explain a new method of solving differential equations with some group symmetry . the original equations involved the adjoint representation of the @xmath1 group . by expressing the solutions in terms of the fundamental representation ( spinors ) we were able to simplify the equations",
    "this technique will also work for other symmetry groups .        in order to see the underlying group structure ,",
    "we shall rewrite eq .",
    "( [ prec ] ) with the use of the structure constants @xmath113 for the @xmath1 group . to show the general structure of these equations more clearly",
    ", we will change the notation as follows : @xmath114 the structure constants for the @xmath1 group are given by the levi - civita symbols @xmath115 .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of looking at these equations .",
    "one may consider the right hand side as the poisson bracket of @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "then the equations determine a family of canonical transformations .",
    "alternatively , one may view them as the evolution equation of a vector @xmath118 in the adjoint representation of the group , i.e. @xmath119 { \\bm{\\mathcal{x}}}(\\lambda),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrices @xmath120 are the spin 1 matrices in the cartesian basis .",
    "the second interpretation is closer to our procedure .",
    "we just replace the evolution equations ( [ adj ] ) for the vector in the adjoint representation ( spin 1 ) by the evolution equations for the vector in the fundamental representation ( spin 1/2 ) .",
    "we only have to change the generators @xmath121 but we keep the same combination of the generators as determined by @xmath122 . after solving the equations in the spinorial representation we may construct solutions in any other representation by taking the appropriate products .    27 i. bialynicki - birula , p. grnicki , and j. rafelski , phys .",
