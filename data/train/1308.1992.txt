    "the ` hidden - order ' ( ho ) state of heavy - fermion compound uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , which is defined by a second order phase transition , represents a new state of matter with peculiar electronic , and magnetic properties.@xcite the particularly intriguing characteristics of the ho state are large anomaly in spin - related measurements including inelastic neutron scattering ( ins),@xcite nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr),@xcite magneto - torque,@xcite and magnetic susceptibility,@xcite despite the absence of any accountable static magnetic moment,@xcite and time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "these trademark signatures of the ho state @xmath1 which apparently conflict with each other according to the conventional physics of quantum phase transition @xmath1 demand a new mechanism of quantum order which concurrently involves broken and invariant symmetries .",
    "the present theoretical efforts@xcite encompassing a large body of new order parameters have been inclusive.@xcite    essential clues to the paradoxical symmetry properties of the ho state can be lent from the theory of symmetry - protected quantum spin hall@xcite and topological phases@xcite of matter which have been shown in recent years to arise from spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) entanglement in the single - electron wavefunction .",
    "another interesting analogy can be made with the theory of weyl semimetals , originally refereed as ` accidental degeneracy in bands'@xcite , in which multiple relativistic dirac points are scattered in the momentum space ( and thus termed ` semimetal ' ) owing to a broken crystal symmetry , but they remain topologically protected via other subjective symmetry invariance.@xcite these compelling physical concepts led us to propose and formulate an electronic interaction induced spin - orbit density wave ( sodw ) as an emergent phase of matter which stabilizes in soc systems via broken translational but invariant time - reversal symmetry.@xcite    the consistency of the sodw properties with many experimental signatures of the ho phase in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is appealing , particularly as it reconciles the apparently contradictory magnetic properties of this phase . among them , we highlight the following robust properties .",
    "( 1 ) the present order breaks translational symmetry,@xcite , but thanks to soc , the order parameter respects time - reversal symmetry and charge conservation symmetry at each lattice point . ( 2 ) as a result , no magnetic moment is induced , in agreement with measurements.@xcite ( 3 ) time - reversal symmetry invariance fosters magnetic field , in addition to temperature , to be a perturbation to the order parameter , and the corresponding critical field primarily depends on the gap value and the @xmath2 factor .",
    "experiments confirm the vanishing of the ho around @xmath3  t.@xcite .",
    "( 4 ) as a consequence , as field increases the ho gap decreases ( given other parameters such as temperature being constant ) , and thus the resistivity decreases .",
    "in other words , a negative magnetoresistance effect is expected within the sodw framework , when no other field - induced phase is involved . here",
    "we explore and expand this chart to demonstrate that the sodw gives a unified explanation to the itinerant gapping of the electronic structure , and the magnetic excitation spectrum in terms of the dispersion in both energy and momentum space .",
    "finally , we offer a detectable prediction of a second spin-1 collective mode localized inside the gap at @xmath4 in the sodw state which can be probed via electron spin resonance ( esr ) or nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) at zero magnetic field or polarized neutron scattering measurements .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our first - principles bandstructure calculation for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 and compute the bare susceptibility to understand the nesting condition . here",
    ", we also present the analytical hamiltonian of the sodw order based on two orbitals with atomistic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we obtain the wavefunction of the sodw and show explicitly how magnetic moment vanishes for all spin channels in the sodw state . in sec .",
    "iii , we show representative results of electronic structure and magnetic structure of the sodw in the hidden order state of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . finally we conclude in sec .",
    "the low - energy electronic states of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 can be defined by itinerant quasiparticle dynamics , with the inclusion of a relevant mass renormalization , because the transformation from localized to itinerant electrons occurs at a much higher temperature @xmath560 - 80  k , signaled consistently by specific heat , magnetic susceptibility,@xcite and tunneling@xcite measurements .",
    "furthermore , pertaining to the larger atomic size of 5@xmath6 electrons in u atoms than in the highly localized smaller 4@xmath6 atoms , the inter - atomic electron hopping is larger here and mobile 5@xmath6 electrons stem within the single - electron picture . in other words , the electronic structure of this actinide compound can be described adequately by first - principles calculation , without invoking kondo - like physics .",
    "in fact , both dft calculation@xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurement@xcite have ruled out the presence of @xmath7 electrons within the @xmath8500  mev vicinity of the fermi level to cause any significant hybridizations .",
    "of course , among the octet and sextet multiplets of 5@xmath6 electrons , variable renormalizations to different states can cause mixing between localized and itinerant electrons within the @xmath6 states .",
    "the above observation is consistent with the dft bandstructure , calculated by including soc using the wien2k software,@xcite and shown by blue solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) along several representative high - symmetry momentum ( * k * ) directions in the body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice of the crystal . from their corresponding band characters , two facts emerge that the bands are dominated by 5@xmath6 multiplets in the low - energy scales of present interests , and these @xmath6 states are itinerant . the corresponding fermi surface ( fs ) topology is depicted in fig.[fig1](b ) , overlayed by a shifted fs with the ` hot - spot ' wavevector @xmath9 ( red lines ) in this unit cell notation .",
    "paramount fs nesting is evident here between different orbitals , and hence identified it to be responsible for the sodw state .",
    "the fs nesting property is confirmed by static susceptibility calculation , plotted in the basal plane momentum space , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) , exhibiting a dominant peak at this @xmath10 vector .",
    "the band structure shifted by @xmath10 is then plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) in red color which reveals that the low - energy bands are linear in momentum , and the contact points between main bands and folded bands at the fermi level are in the particle - hole channel along the ( 110 ) direction .",
    "therefore , the nesting condition in this system resembles the so - called ` accidental degenerate points ' or weyl - type dirac cones@xcite as visualized in the entire two - dimensional momentum space in figs .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) for the relevant bands .",
    "this fact justifies our ansatz that the sodw is a protected state , as in topological weyl semimetals .    constrained by the fs properties and the nesting condition , it is appropriate to write down the effective theory for the ho state by using two nested bands . furthermore , although we take the bandstructure directly from above the dft calculation to obtain numerical results in sec .",
    "iii , to explicate the physical mechanism of sodw and the role of soc in it , we start from a two - orbital basis with atomistic soc , @xmath11 .",
    "the purpose here is to derive a general hamiltonian of such kind and obtained analytical solution of the sodw wavefunction and nonmagnetic ground state , in which no particular assumption of the orbital symmetry and the relevant details of the soc are imposed .",
    "our starting noninteracting hamiltonian is thus @xmath12 , \\label{h0}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the electron creation operator in the @xmath14 orbital with spin @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is its corresponding dispersion spectrum in a translationally invariant crystal of bloch momentum @xmath17 . with a translational symmetry breaking at the reduced reciprocal wavevector or the `` hot - spot '' vector @xmath10 , the new spin - orbit basis in the nambu - space yields @xmath18 .",
    "the spin - polarized nambu operator is an important consideration which distinguishes the present sodw order parameter from an inter - orbital spin - density wave ( see , for example , ref .  ) , and promotes a _ zero _ magnetic moment as will be evaluated rigorously below . in this basis , we express our interacting hamiltonian in a matrix form : @xmath19 the sodw field parameter @xmath20 is taken to be complex for generality and will be defined below .",
    "we diagonalize the above hamiltonian in two steps by the bogolyubov method .",
    "first , we define the bogolyubov spinor for the soc term as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the 2@xmath232 identity matrix , and @xmath24 is the second pauli matrix , representing orbital basis . after this basis transformation , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ h0 ] becomes diagonal with eigenstates @xmath25 , and the corresponding spin - orbit helical weight is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . for our main computation and presentation ,",
    "we start with this spin - orbit basis accessed directly from the dft calculation including soc and include interaction .",
    "the subsequent diagonalization onto the nambu - basis on the reduced brillouin zone follows similarly , and the spin and orbital notations are retained explicitly . here the bogolyubov basis transformation is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the orbital indices , and @xmath31 is the spin - orbit helicity index which changes sign when orbitals are interchanged . here",
    "the canonical density operators @xmath32 take equivalent forms as that of @xmath33 defined before , after replacing the corresponding quasiparticle states with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the final quasiparticle spectra in the sodw state with soc are thus @xmath36 , and two more eigenvalues when orbitals 1 and 2 are interchanged . a schematic view of the sodw split bands and the shared orbital character , determined by coherence factors @xmath37 between them is given in fig .  [ fig2](a ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the soc allows the many - particle wavefunction to have a dynamical spin flip on the same orbital at the same momentum as indicated by vertical arrow , which governs a collective @xmath38 mode to be derived below .",
    "it is worthwhile to combine the above two steps to visualize how the four - vector sodw nambu operator transforms under translational symmetry breaking while retaining time - reversal symmetry :    @xmath39    an immediate ansatz emerges from the above transformation@xmath1guided by the same symmetry of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ hint]@xmath1that the system is time - reversal invariant under the representation of this symmetry @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the complex conjugation . under time reversal , the hamiltonian transforms as @xmath42 .",
    "this important symmetry consideration renders a _ zero _ magnetic moment , as depicted schematically in fig .",

    "indices @xmath46 are for two bands and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are components of pauli matrices , and @xmath49 is the total number of states .",
    "this is due to the fact that magnetic moment in different orbitals cancel each other owing to soc .    on the other hand",
    ", the sodw order parameter has finite expectation value as @xmath50\\left[f(\\tilde{e}^+_{\\bf k})-f(\\tilde{e}^-_{\\bf k})\\right ] , \\label{sodw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fermion occupation number is defined as @xmath51 and so on , and @xmath52 are the degenerate eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) .",
    "the notation ` prime ' over the momentum summation indicates that the summation is restricted within the reduced brillouin zone .",

    "the state - of - the - art electronic and magnetic fingerprints of the sodw induced ho state are evaluated using dft - based band structure as the input frame of reference , and writing down the reduced space hamiltonian with ` hot - spot ' wavevector @xmath9 in the bct crystal structure . in presenting the results , we focus on the representative electronic properties obtained from arpes,@xcite and the spin - excitation spectrum measured by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiment.@xcite figure  [ fig3 ] gives the single - particle maps along several representative momentum cuts , and the fs topology before and after the ho transition .",
    "gapping of the fs is clearly visible for the two bands aligned along the ( 110)-direction at the degenerate dirac points at the fermi level , introduced in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "this gapping process truncates the paramagnetic fs into small pockets aligned along the bond - direction .",
    "we require paying particular attention to the location of the fs pockets in this system , since the original crystal structure is bct ( not simple tetragonal which is often used for the simplification of computation ) . in this unit cell notation , the location of gapping and fs pockets governed in the sodw state are in direct agreement with the arpes spectral function map on the fs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) .",
    "we find that the locii of the gapped states move away from the fermi level as we increase @xmath61 value .",
    "we note that a shubunikov de - hass ( sdh ) measurement finds that the quantum oscillation frequency does not change by any significant amount in going from ho phase at ambient pressure to the large moment antiferromagnetic ( lmaf ) phase at high pressure,@xcite indicating that the ho phase is intertwined with the lmaf phase at high pressure and at finite magnetic field .",
    "our final results of the spin - excitation spectrum have two - fold objectives .",
    "they give a realistic fit to the existing data of ins both in dispersion and energy values , and also make a prediction of a second @xmath4 mode in the sodw which can be probed by esr or nqr without any applied static magnetic field .",
    "ins measures the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility@xmath1modulo materials specific form factor@xmath1which is theoretically computed as a convolution of the single - particle green s function in the ho state @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the fermionic matsubara frequency and @xmath64 are band indices , and @xmath65 is the green s function in the @xmath66 band and so on , and @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are obtained by taking analytical continuation to the real frequency axis and integrating over the complex plane as @xmath68 with @xmath69 being infinitesimal .",

    "it should be noted that the mechanism and structure of the interacting susceptibility is mainly tied to the details of the electronic structure and ho ` hot - spot ' wavevector embedded within this bare susceptibility ; however , it becomes a collective excitation when rpa correction is included .",

    "figure  [ fig4](a ) presents the computed inter - band spin excitation spectrum along the zone diagonal direction , and compares with the corresponding experimental data@xcite obtained along the zone boundary direction given in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . for the inter - band transition in the particle - hole continuum",
    ", we clearly mark a prominent @xmath38 collective mode with a dispersion that resembles a gapped goldstone mode or a roton - like spectrum . for the case of the discrete symmetry breaking due to the complex order parameter @xmath75 , such gapping of the goldstone mode",
    "is expected .",
    "the mode is localized around @xmath76 , slightly shifted from the original ho wavevector @xmath10 due to the band structure effect .",
    "however , the shift of the mode below @xmath77 is a many - body correction as discussed above . to match the mode energy of the experimental data about @xmath78=5  mev",
    ", a gap amplitude of @xmath79  mev is invoked in our calculation which is close to the spectroscopic value of the ho gap.@xcite although a static neutron signal is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath80 , but in the inelastic spectrum , both experiment@xcite and our theory find a weaker and featureless intensity at this wavevector , as compared in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) .",
    "we note that the ins spectral weight loss at the incommensurate wavevector , as opposed to the commensurate one , can fully account for the entropy loss at the ho transition .    by construction ,",
    "the sodw is associated with an interaction induced spin - orbit entangled electronic structure , rendering conceptual similarity with the spin - orbit order in the particle - particle channel proposed by leggett@xcite for the liquid @xmath81he superconducting phase , dynamic generation of soc@xcite or the single - particle quantum spin - hall state@xcite which do not break time - reversal symmetry . in",
    "what follows , the umklapp scattering process between different spin - orbital states brings out two zeeman - like spin - split states at the same momentum * k * , on both sides of the ho gap with coherence factors @xmath37 , without any external magnetic field , as discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "therefore , a second spin - flip collective mode is expected in the off - diagonal susceptibility @xmath82 to localize inside the sodw gap @xmath83 around @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , our computation confirms the existence of this collective mode at energy @xmath84 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4](c ) and [ fig4](e ) . since the intensity of this mode is about an order of magnitude lower than that of the @xmath10-mode presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , it will be difficult to simultaneously detect them both in the ins measurements",
    ". however , esr or nqr , having the capability of detecting lineshifts of resonance without the application of a static magnetic field , will be able to measure our proposed @xmath85 mode .",
    "in addition , we also reproduce a large anisotropy in the spin - susceptibility with the anisotropy arising below @xmath86  k. this implies that the susceptibility anisotropy is related to the bandstructure of this compound , and not triggered by the ho phase .",
    "our result ( not shown ) is similar to the one obtained earlier in ref .   using similar dft bandstructure , and agrees well with experiment.@xcite",
    "broken and invariant symmetries drive quantum phase transitions and the stability of a phase , respectively , and thus the uncharted physical phenomena emerging from their interplay can inherit even more interesting merits . spin - orbit entanglement has gained recent attention along this line which has been shown to foster the quantum spin - hall state,@xcite and other topologically protected phases@xcite due to the time - reversal invariance . it is also shown that the spin - orbit coupling is directly or indirectly responsible for causing landau - type novel quantum phase transitions via , for example , translational symmetry breaking where time - reversal symmetry is not necessarily broken in two - dimensional electron gas,@xcite and iridates@xcite .",
    "sodw is a leading example of this kind that we formulate and characterize here.@xcite the direct consequence of this order is that the magnetic field is a perturbation to this order ( for symmetry reason ) , in addition to the temperature . of course",
    ", since the sodw renders fs gapping , and thereby larger resistivity with respect to its paramagnetic value , the application of magnetic field will lead to a reduction in resistivity ( when other parameters are kept constant ) which is often refereed as the negative magnetoresistance effect . finally , the shared coherence weight of the quasiparticle weight between the spin - orbit entangled state leads to a collective excitation mode , localized in energy @xmath77 at the zero momentum transfer .",
    "this is shown here to exist in the uru@xmath0si@xmath0 band structure below the ho transition , and can be measured in future esr or nqr or polarized ins measurements .",
    "taken together , a generalized framework for the theory of sodw and its relevant electronic and magnetic fingerprints are deduced here and shown to reconcile a number of experimental signatures of the ho state in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 which were taken earlier to be contradictory according to conventional theories . the essential ingredient for the realization of a sodw in any other systems is that the single - electron wavefunction inherits a spin - orbit coupling stronger than its effective inter - orbital coulomb interaction .",
    "finally , we note that the possible competition and/ or coexistence of the ho phase with large moment antiferromagnetic phase at high - pressure will be studied in a future work.@xcite    the author acknowledges valuable discussion with a. leggett , j. mydosh , p. coleman , m. j. graf , p. woelfle , and j .- h .",
    "the author expresses gratitude to a. leggett for suggesting the study of esr for the sodw order parameter , and to jian - xin zhu for sharing some of the first - principles band structure files for wien2k calculation .",

    "@xmath97 is the single - particle green s function in the orbital basis ( while that presented in the main text is in the band basis ) .",

    "( [ rpaham1 ] ) .    finally , in the sodw state , each component of non - interacting susceptibility again becomes a 2@xmath232 matrix , made of direct transitions ( in the diagonal terms ) and umklapp scattering terms placed in off - diagonals .",
    "the direct term means scattering between two main bands and between two shadow bands while the umklapp term arises from the scattering between main and shadow bands .",
    "the direct term gives a gapped spectrum at the ` hot - spot ' vector , while the umklapp term is responsible for the @xmath4 mode as discussed in the main text .",
    "the interacting susceptibility is calculated within rpa framework in which the rpa susceptibility matrix is @xmath105 , where @xmath22 is the identity matrix and @xmath106 is the rpa vertex of same dimension as of @xmath107 .",

    "as mentioned before , the small contributions of hund s coupling and pair - scattering terms are neglected here .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry of the sodw hamiltonian enforces the total magnetic moment to vanish at each spatial point .",

    "it is interesting to see that for both cases of @xmath114 , the magnetic moment vanishes , which means there is no magnetic moment associated with the sodw order parameter in any spatial direction . in this spirit",

    "<S> the mysterious second order quantum phase transition , commonly attributed to the ` hidden - order ' ( ho ) state , in heavy - fermion metal uru@xmath0si@xmath0 exhibits a number of paradoxical electronic and magnetic properties which can not be associated with any conventional order parameter . we characterize and reconcile these exotic properties of the ho state based on a spin - orbit density wave order ( sodw ) , constructed on the basis of a realistic density - functional theory ( dft ) band structure . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the nature of the gapped electronic and magnetic excitation spectrum , in agreement with measurements , while the magnetic moment is calculated to be _ zero _ owing to the spin - orbit coupling induced time - reversal invariance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a new collective mode in the spin-1 excitation spectrum is predicted to localize at zero momentum transfer in the ho state which can be visualized , for example , by electron spin resonance ( esr ) at zero magnetic field or polarized inelastic neutron scattering measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate that the concomitant broken and invariant symmetries protected sodw order not only provides insights into numerous nontrivial hidden - order phenomena , but also offers a parallel laboratory to the formation of a topologically protected quantum state beyond the quantum spin - hall state and weyl semimetals . </S>"
