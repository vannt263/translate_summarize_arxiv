    "a good example is provided by the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite where an absorbing medium can be rendered transparent to a probe field if it is simultaneously submitted to the action of a coupling field .",
    "eit takes place when the two fields satisfy a two photon resonance condition between atomic levels .",
    "the corresponding ( coherence ) resonance for the probe absorption is called a `` dark resonance '' and is associated to the system being driven into a `` dark state '' i.e. a coherent superposition of atomic states uncoupled to the light field@xcite .    in recent years , a new kind of coherence resonance was observed in which the atomic coherence results in an increase in the absorption of a probe field @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon designated electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) , bears except for the sign of the resonance , several common features with eit although it can not be associated to the system being driven into a particular superposition of atomic states .",
    "eia was first observed on a transition between two atomic levels with angular momentum degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the degenerate two - level system ( dtls ) was illuminated by  a resonant pump field and probed with a tunable probe field .",
    "it was clearly established that eia is essentially a multilevel effect in the sense that it only takes place if both the lower and the upper atomic levels posses degeneracy .",

    "the transient behavior of eit in three level system when the pump field is suddenly switched on is considered and the onset of rabi oscillations for saturating pump field intensities discussed .",
    "the occurrence of eit for low intensities was analyzed in @xcite for a closed three level @xmath7 system .",
    "it is established that eit can take place even for very low intensities and that the characteristic time for the onset of the resonance is proportional to the square of the pumping field rabi frequency divided by the excited state relaxation rate .",

    "it is argued that this behavior is characteristic of open systems .",
