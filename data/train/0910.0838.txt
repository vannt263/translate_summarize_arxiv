    "the reionization epoch represents the latest observational frontier of galaxy formation .",
    "little is known about the galaxy properties during this time , including feedback , metal production , and their contribution to reionization .",

    "the arrival of wfc3/ir aboard _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ heralds a dramatic improvement in our ability to survey the reionization era , allowing us to identify the predominant low - luminosity galaxies at @xmath30 by their redshifted @xmath32 light . whereas _ hst",
    "_ remains crucial for identifying the galaxies , longer - wavelength data are necessary for constraining the stellar masses and ages .",
    "access to the rest - frame optical is offered by the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) on _ spitzer _ , which by itself has permitted estimates of stellar masses for large numbers of @xmath33 sources @xcite , and even a few at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one surprising early finding was the number of quite massive @xmath34 galaxies with appreciable ages ( @xmath35myr ) suggesting the galaxies formed substantial amounts of stars at even earlier times , well into the epoch of reionization @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we extend the stellar mass and age estimates to lower luminosities ( @xmath36 ) and higher redshift @xmath37 by analyzing the irac mid - ir fluxes of the robust @xmath8-dropout and @xmath3-dropout galaxy samples found by @xcite and @xcite in the newly acquired wfc3/ir data ( go-11563 , pi illingworth ) over the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt an @xmath38 cosmology with @xmath39  km  s@xmath17mpc@xmath17 .",
    "magnitudes are in the ab photometric system @xcite .",
    "imaging depths refer to @xmath40 ab point source total magnitude , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the recent @xmath41 @xmath1dropout   and @xmath28 @xmath9dropout   samples were selected from exceptionally deep wfc3/ir imaging , to @xmath42 ab magnitude @xmath43 in @xmath3,@xmath44,@xmath45 , allowing the study of fainter sources than the nicmos based samples presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we discuss briefly the irac photometry of 14 of the 16 @xmath1dropouts found by @xcite and the 5 @xmath9dropouts reported by @xcite ( see @xcite for the two @xmath1dropouts found earlier with nicmos ) .",
    "_ spitzer _ data over this field were obtained from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; m. dickinson et al . in preparation ) , which observed the hudf with irac in two epochs of @xmath46 hr each .",
    "the irac depths in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 bands are 27.7 and 27.2 ( ab ) .",
    "we supplement the observations with deep @xmath49-band data from the _ very large telescope _ and _ magellan _ to k@xmath50 ( i. labb et al . in preparation ) .",
    "a critical aspect is obtaining reliable irac fluxes of the candidates .",
    "this is challenging because of extended wings of the irac point - spread function ( psf ) , causing flux contamination from nearby foreground sources .",
    "we use the technique of @xcite to fit and subtract the foreground sources using the flux profiles in the ultradeep wfc3/ir detection images as priors ( see @xcite for a more complete description and @xcite for illustrative examples ) .    after cleaning the irac images , we first performed conventional aperture photometry in @xmath47 and @xmath48 bands in 25 diameter apertures .",
    "we define the photometric error as the quadratic sum of random fluctuations in the aperture ( determined from empty apertures on the nearby background ; e.g. , @xcite ) and the fit uncertainties to each individual neighbor .",
    "we performed the photometry independently on the first and second epoch irac data , which are rotated by @xmath51 and therefore have different psfs and contamination ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two of the 14 @xmath8-dropouts and 1 @xmath3-dropout were too close to bright sources to be successfully measured and were removed from the sample ( later we assume average @xmath52 for these galaxies ) .",
    "of the remaining galaxies none were detected ( @xmath53 ) in the epochs individually or combined ( to @xmath6>26.9 $ ] , @xmath7 total ) .",
    "owing to the extreme faintness of the @xmath1dropout  and @xmath9dropout  samples over the wfc3 hudf09 field , we derive average properties by registering and stacking the confusion corrected irac maps .",
    "the resulting stacked image for the 12 @xmath8-dropouts is shown in figure  [ figstack ] , featuring an unambiguous source coincident with the @xmath1dropout  location , with an average magnitude of @xmath6=27.2 $ ] ( ab , measured in a 25 diameter aperture and corrected to total ) . to evaluate robustness of the detection",
    "we also create a median stack , which is resistant against outliers , to ensure that the signal is not coming from only a few sources .",
    "we derive uncertainties by bootstrap resampling the images in the stack 200 times , finding signal - to - noise ratio @xmath54 .",

    "detecting the @xmath9dropouts is even more challenging .",
    "not only are the @xmath3-dropouts in our samples fainter , there are also fewer to stack ( 4 versus 12 ) , and they might be bluer due to younger ages , lower metallicities , or other effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the resulting stacked image for the 4 is shown in the lower panels of figure  [ figstack ] , showing no detection to a limit @xmath6>27.5 $ ] ( @xmath7 , total ) .",
    "the formal measurement is @xmath57 .",
    "the photometry is presented in table  1 .",
    "the average sed shape of the faint @xmath0 @xmath1dropout  galaxies , shown in figure  [ figsed ] , is remarkably similar to that of the more luminous and massive nicmos sample presented by @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame far - uv slope is extremely blue ( @xcite find @xmath58 ) , suggesting low ages or sub - solar metallicities .",
    "however , note the relatively red @xmath45@xmath59=0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.25}$ ] color , suggesting the presence of a modest balmer break between the bands , indicative of evolved stellar populations .",
    "we use standard techniques to derive stellar masses and redshifts by fitting stellar populations synthesis models to the average @xmath60-band flux densities of the @xmath1dropouts and @xmath9dropouts . we use ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 ) models and assume solar metallicity and a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) between @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xmath63 .",
    "this choice enables straightforward comparison with previous results , but we also review the effect of different assumptions and models .",
    "furthermore , we assume constant star formation ( csf ) as opposed to exponentially declining models , motivated by the lack of evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) per unit mass ( specific sfr,(ssfr ) ) between @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "up to @xmath66  mag @xcite starburst reddening is allowed , where we note that @xmath67 galaxies have blue uv - continuum slopes and low dust extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use the @xmath68-fitting code fast @xcite which provides best - fit parameters and uncertainties using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we fit the average sed fluxes to models smoothed to a resolution of 100    rest frame , corresponding to the approximate width of the dropout selection windows .",
    "the modeling results are presented in table  2 and overplotted in figure  [ figsed ] .",
    "the best - fit redshifts of the @xmath1dropouts and @xmath9dropouts are @xmath69 and @xmath20 , respectively , in agreement with expectations from simulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the extremely blue rest - frame far - uv slope of the @xmath0 galaxies is a challenge to fit , requiring @xmath12 , and sub - solar metallicity rather than solar models ( @xmath70 versus @xmath71 ) .",
    "consistently , the relatively red @xmath11 color favors evolved models ( age@xmath72myr ( for csf ) , where @xmath73 is the time elapsed since the start of star formation . ] ) .",
    "we caution that emission lines can contribute to the @xmath6 $ ] flux , but for the redshift distribution and @xmath74 $ ] color of this sample we estimate the effect is only @xmath75 mag .",
    "interestingly , @xcite and charlot and bruzual ( in preparation ; cb07 ) models produce nearly identical results as the bc03 models . derived stellar masses are quite robust with at most 0.1  dex systematic variation between the different model choices . the only important effect on the masses",
    "is imf : a more reasonable @xcite imf reduces the stellar masses and sfrs by @xmath76  dex , but does not change other parameters or the quality of fit .",
    "more detailed exploration of the stellar ages and star formation histories ( sfhs ) is presented by @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses and ages of the @xmath9dropout  galaxies are not well constrained .",
    "the low s / n of the irac stack causes the fit to be determined by the @xmath44  and @xmath45  fluxes , producing a formal best - fit with minimal allowed masses @xmath77 and ages @xmath78  myr and @xmath311.5 dex uncertainties .",
    "however , if we refit the @xmath0 stack without irac data we also find very low masses and ages and large uncertainties .",
    "this underscores the crucial importance of deep irac data and suggests that model fits relying exclusively on far - uv data should be regarded with caution .",
    "even though the fits may suggest a strong evolution of the stellar populations , we can not exclude that galaxies at @xmath2 have similar masses , ages , and @xmath52s as faint @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the reionization epoch represents the latest frontier of galaxy formation theory , which is now being probed to extreme depths with the amazingly efficient wfc3/ir camera aboard _",
    "hst_. using the conservative @xmath1dropout and @xmath9dropout  samples of @xcite and @xcite we find _",
    "spitzer_/irac capable of an equally remarkable feat : the stacked @xmath79 detection of even the faintest @xmath80 galaxies found by wfc3/ir , providing direct proof that irac can probe much deeper than widely accepted .",
    "in addition we derive upper limits for the newly discovered @xmath81 galaxies , some of which may well be at higher redshift than the currently most distant @xmath82 grb @xcite .",
    "we now elaborate on various implications .",
    "+ _ 1 ) stellar populations at @xmath0 _ + _",
    "spitzer_/irac places two important constraints on the stellar populations .",
    "first , the combination of the blue far - uv slope and the moderately red @xmath74=0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.25}$ ] color in the ultrafaint ( @xmath83 ) @xmath0 galaxies indicates the presence of a modest balmer break , expected for evolved stellar populations .",
    "very young stellar ages are ruled out ( csf age@xmath84myr at @xmath85% ) .",
    "interestingly , low - metallicity models , which produce bluer far - uv colors at fixed age , provide significantly better fits than do solar , but for both it is challenging to reproduce the extremely blue observed far - uv slope ( @xmath58 as found by @xcite ) .",
    "second , the average stellar masses @xmath86 indicate appreciable mass - to - light ratios m / l@xmath87 and m / l@xmath88 .",
    "the ratios are comparable those of the more massive @xmath89 sample of @xcite , suggesting that the @xmath52 ratios do not strongly depend on luminosity or mass .",
    "we find no appreciable difference between the best - fit parameters of bc03 , ma05 , and cb07 models , although imf variations are a potentially significant source of systematic uncertainty : a steeper high - mass slope ( e.g. , @xcite ) would lower the inferred stellar ages , a higher characteristic mass ( e.g. , `` bottom light '' , @xcite ) would lower the total stellar masses and @xmath52s , and any evolution with time would complicate comparisons between sfr and stellar mass across epochs .",
    "+ _ 2 ) star formation histories _ + sfhs are notoriously hard to constrain from observations of individual galaxies .",
    "however , statistical constraints can be obtained by comparing the ssfrs as a function of time and mass , as different shapes of the sfh give rise to distinctly different evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one remarkable recent result is the observation that the ssfr at fixed @xmath90 does not evolve from @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "here we benefit from the extreme depths of the wfc3/ir data to probe the lowest luminosities , suggesting that the ssfr at @xmath0 is also not strongly dependent on luminosity or stellar mass over the range @xmath92 .",
    "this may imply that the sfr correlates with stellar mass with a logarithmic slope close to 1 . both results ( with redshift and mass )",
    "qualitatively agree with numerical simulations for early galactic star formation ( @xmath93 , which robustly predict that sfr is proportional to m * , with similar sfhs in haloes of different masses @xcite , and that the sfrs of individual galaxies are constantly rising @xcite .",
    "+ _ 3 ) evolution of the stellar mass density to @xmath94 _ + the low - luminosity galaxies probed in this paper are expected to contribute significantly to the stellar mass density owing to their substantial @xmath52 . following the approach of @xcite",
    ", we derive integrated stellar mass densities at @xmath94 by multiplying the uv - luminosity densities of @xcite , integrated to @xmath95 , with the mean @xmath52 derived for the galaxy samples in this letter . for the @xmath1dropouts at @xmath0 ,",
    "this results in @xmath96mpc@xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of the mass density is shown in figure  [ figmass ] , compared to previous luminous samples , which were corrected to the same luminosity limit assuming a constant @xmath52 .",
    "the stellar masses at @xmath28 are uncertain by @xmath97dex due to the weak constraints from irac , so instead of plotting the best - fit @xmath52 we show the 95% confidence upper limit .",
    "the integrated mass density to a limit of @xmath22 then declines to @xmath98mpc@xmath24 .",
    "this is marginally consistent with the extrapolation of the @xmath26 evolution over the range @xmath99 .",
    "the upper limit may be evidence for a more rapid evolution toward @xmath28 , but deeper irac data and larger samples are needed to establish this firmly .",
    "the uncertainties quoted above do not include cosmic variance , which is estimated to be @xmath100% for the @xmath0 sample and @xmath101% at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "+ _ 4 ) reinionization since @xmath102 _ + combined , the results have profound implications for the ability of the universe to be reionized by photons from star formation  and to remain so for an extended period .",
    "crucially , the large stellar mass density in @xmath0 low - luminosity galaxies points to significant amounts of star formation at earlier times .",
    "we can therefore ask whether this corresponds to enough ionizing photons at higher redshift to keep the universe reionized .",
    "let us assume the stellar mass density @xmath103mpc@xmath24 was assembled in the @xmath104  myr between @xmath19 , in the reionization era ( wmap5 , @xcite ) .",
    "correcting by 10% to account for mass loss in stellar evolution , the possible sustained sfr density would then be @xmath105yr@xmath17mpc@xmath24 , significantly higher than that has been derived for luminous galaxies alone @xcite .",
    "however , the primary uncertainty is the fiducial critical sfr density needed for reionization @xmath106 @xcite , which depends sensitively on the values for the igm clumping factor @xmath107 and the fraction of ionizing photons @xmath108 that leak unhindered out of the galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the popular choice @xmath109 leads to @xmath110yr@xmath17mpc@xmath24 averaged over @xmath19 , which is @xmath111 times higher than that can be explained by the stellar masses .",
    "however , at early times the clumping factor may be as low as @xmath112 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the escape fraction may be significantly higher as well : recent numerical simulations suggest @xmath113 @xcite and @xcite note that the extremely blue far - uv slope of the galaxies studied here could also result from large escape fractions @xmath114 .",
    "the choice @xmath115 leads to @xmath116yr@xmath17mpc@xmath24(over @xmath19 ) , which means photons from the low - luminosity star forming galaxies observed here are capable of causing sustained reionization since @xmath117 .",
    "+ the first _",
    "spitzer_/irac detection of low - luminosity @xmath41 galaxies and their red @xmath118\\approx0.7 $ ] colors provide important insights into the earliest phases of galaxy evolution , showing that these early galaxies have relatively high @xmath14myr ages and @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , low - luminosity galaxies contribute significantly to the stellar mass density @xmath119mpc@xmath24 , suggesting that the sfr corresponding to that mass may have provided a substantial fraction of the ionizing photons that kept the universe reionized at earlier times .",

    "<S> the best - fit ages @xmath14myr , @xmath15 , and @xmath16  gyr@xmath17 are similar to values reported for luminous @xmath0 galaxies , indicating the galaxies are smaller but not much younger . the sub@xmath18 galaxies observed here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and under favorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustained reionization at @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath20 @xmath3-dropouts have stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near - complete reliance on far - uv data . adopting the @xmath7 upper limit on the @xmath21 , the stellar mass density to @xmath22 declines from @xmath23mpc@xmath24 to @xmath25mpc@xmath24 , following @xmath26 over @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> lower masses at @xmath28 would signify more dramatic evolution , which can be established with deeper irac observations , long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope . </S>"
