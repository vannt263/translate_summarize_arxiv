    "passive microwave remote sensing has a long track record especially in earth observation .",
    "currently , there is an increasing interest in using microwave remote sensing for monitoring key parameters of our environment .",
    "it offers an all - weather capability that is paramount to understanding and monitoring surface variables and parameters of earth . among the parameters which can be measured",
    "are sea surface temperature @xcite , ocean salinity @xcite , soil moisture @xcite and sea ice concentration @xcite to name but a few . for several measurements , notably sea surface salinity or surface soil moisture ,",
    "low frequencies are to be preferred @xcite which leads to using the protected frequency bands ( e.g. , 1400 - 1427 mhz ) .",
    "however , spatial resolution then becomes an issue because an adequate resolution ( 10  40 km ) requires a large antenna ( respectively 32 to 8 meters , roughly ) .",
    "as the launcher s shroud is limited , embarking an 8 meter antenna is already a challenge which has been addressed differently according to the science objectives .",
    "+ the smos mission was the first attempt ever to have an l band radiometer on a satellite ( the skylab mission was an attempt to check feasibility during a very short period of time in the 1970s @xcite ) . to address both sea surface salinity and soil moisture",
    "it was proposed to esa to use spatial aperture synthesis interferometry @xcite , giving a relatively high spatial resolution ( ranging from 27 to 60 km ) with a deployable antenna .",
    "the radiometric resolution is relatively low but can easily be compensated by multi - angular acquisitions @xcite .",
    "the satellite was launched in 2009 and is still operational providing good results on both oceans and land .",
    "alternative approaches use filled antennae and do not achieve the same spatial resolution , such as the aquarius mission ( launched 2011 , @xmath0100 km resolution , @xcite ) , and the smap mission ( launched in january , 2015 , 47@xmath1 km resolution @xcite ) . + spatial aperture synthesis is a widespread technique in radio - astronomy @xcite .",
    "it is based on precisely timing the arrival times of signals from a given source at spatially separated antennae and then correlating them . in the simplest case of negligible motion of the observer relative to the source and correlation of simultaneously registered signals",
    "the correlation functions are related by a simply fourier - type law to the intensity distribution of the distant incoherent source through the van cittert ",
    "zernike theorem ( vczt ) ( see eq.([vcz ] ) below ) .",
    "the standard derivations of the theorem do not take the motion of the observer relative to the sources into account .",
    "in particular , the doppler shift is neglected .",
    "secondly , one may want to generalize the theorem to correlations of electric fields measured at _ different _ times in order to achieve a _ temporal aperture synthesis _",
    ", where in addition to the physical baselines provided by different antennae , virtual baselines are created through the motion of the same antenna . in astronomy ,",
    "rotational synthesis using the motion of earth has long been used , starting from radio - astronomy in the 1950s till its advance into the visible in the last decade @xcite .",
    "satellite - based temporal aperture synthesis for radio astronomy is currently being tested on board of the mission spektr - r ( radio - astron ) @xcite , whose measured signals are combined with those of antennae on earth and allow one to create virtual baselines of up to 350,000 km lengths .",
    "the notion of measurements at different times arises here due to the different arrival times of a signal from a given small source .",
    "also in microwave remote sensing of earth the use of motion of the satellite was proposed in the recent past @xcite with the same idea of delays specific for each antenna and pixel .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold : firstly , we provide the appropriate generalizations of the van cittert ",
    "zernike theorem to the case of an observer moving relative to the sources .",
    "secondly , we investigate correlations of fields measured at different times , delayed by the motion of the observer along the desired virtual base line .",
    "these delay times depend on the motion of the antennae , but not on the positions of the sources .",
    "the question is whether with such global , pixel - independent shifts virtual baselines can be created .",
    "our derivation is based on first principles , using only maxwell s equations and a lorentz transformation from the earth frame ( where the sources of the electro - magnetic fields are at rest ) to the satellite frame , taken to be moving uniformly with constant speed relative to earth .",
    "we show that there is a remarkable cancellation of the phase due to the first order doppler effect and the phase due to the virtual baseline .",
    "this renders the idea of temporal aperture synthesis through direct correlation of electric fields shifted in time by the travel time of the satellite over the distance of the virtual baseline impossible . at the same time",
    ", our generalized derivation shows that the vczt in its standard form is still valid to first order in the speed of the observer and provides therefore a _ a posteriori _ justification of the use of the theorem for satellite observations of earth without including the doppler shift .",
    "consider two antennae on - board a satellite flying at a height @xmath2 with a speed @xmath3 in the along - track ( @xmath4-direction ) over a current sources at earth surface .",
    "let @xmath5 be the reference frame fixed with respect to earth and @xmath6 the reference frame moving with speed @xmath7 , in which the satellite is thus at rest with the antennae at fixed positions @xmath8 . at time @xmath9 ,",

    "the first one , exploited in spatial aperture synthesis and implemented in smos , uses fields measured at space - time points @xmath27 and @xmath28 , implying a physical baseline @xmath29 .",
    "the second one uses measurements recorded in space - time points @xmath30 and @xmath31 for two different times @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which implies a virtual baseline in frame @xmath19 with an additional `` virtual '' component @xmath34 in the direction of the motion of the satellite ( neglecting here for clarity the relativistic correction , see below for the precise transformation ) .",
    "this is therefore a `` temporal '' aperture synthesis .",

    "these fields are observed at a space - time point @xmath38 in the frame @xmath15 relative to the satellite .",
    "the fields @xmath39 measured in the satellite frame @xmath40 can be obtained from a lorentz transformation ( lt ) that describes the relation between physical quantities measured by two observers moving at constant speed with respect to each other @xcite .",
    "electric and magnetic fields mix under the lorentz transformation , i.e.  we need to calculate both @xmath36 and @xmath37 for obtaining @xmath39",
    ". more precisely , the strategy will be the following :    * calculate @xmath36 and @xmath37 generated by @xmath11 for every space - time point in @xmath13 . *",

    "+ for a given time dependent charge density @xmath20 and current density @xmath11 , the exact expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are ( see eqs.(6.55,6.56 ) in 5th german edition of @xcite ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the unit vector in @xmath49-direction , and @xmath50 are the electric susceptibility and magnetic permeability of vacuum , respectively",
    ". eqs.([elec_field1],[magn_field1 ] ) show that the electric and magnetic fields are fully retarded with respect to the sources by the propagation time @xmath51 .",
    "both fields contain terms present also for static charges and currents that decay according to the coulomb - law with distance , i.e.  as @xmath52 .",
    "however , in the far field @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the wavelength , these terms are negligible compared to the ones decaying as @xmath55 and which arise only for time - dependent charge and current densities @xcite . in the following we will take into account only these radiation fields . in the far - field approximation ,",
    "the fields are given by @xmath56    the lorentz transformation of the electric and magnetic fields from @xmath13 to @xmath15 reads @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",

    "+ the next step consists of lorentz transforming the space - time coordinates in @xmath13 in order to get the expressions of @xmath64 as function of @xmath38 , @xmath65 inserting ( [ t],[r ] ) in ( [ elec_field3 ] ) , one finds that @xmath39 is still given by ( [ elec_field3 ] ) , where , however , the arguments of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , to be inserted after differentiation with respect to @xmath66 , are now @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is to be replaced everywhere on the right hand side , including in @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , by expression ( [ r ] ) .",
    "( [ elec_field3 ] ) can still be further simplified if we take into account that @xmath72 is typically very small .",
    "the example of smos with @xmath73 km , @xmath74km / s , gives @xmath75 .",
    "it makes therefore sense to expand in powers of @xmath72 .",
    "we keep in the following systematically terms up to order @xmath72 in all phases , but neglect corrections of order @xmath72 in the prefactor .",
    "this is justified by the fact that in the end we calculate correlation functions , where the phase information is crucial , whereas the overall amplitudes are irrelevant , as they are , in practice , always renormalized with respect to the total intensity .",
    "+ to first order in @xmath72 , we have @xmath76 and the following approximations @xmath77 with this , one finds @xmath78_{t = t'+\\frac {      { \\mathbold{\\beta}}\\cdot { { \\mathbold r}}'-r}{c}},\\ ] ] where we have introduced a total current source @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "another approximation is in order : we will be interested only in times @xmath16 smaller or equal to the maximum possible averaging time . as explained below , this time",

    "@xmath92 some 1 - 10 km , we have @xmath93 . for the typical values of smos ,",
    "the maximum @xmath16 would be of order 1s , but the inequality shows that even substantially longer times ( @xmath94 ) can still be accommodated in the range of validity of the following approximation : @xmath95 as for the shift @xmath96 in the time argument , we have , with antennae at positions @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( 10 - 100)m @xmath99 , @xmath100 for almost all @xmath16 , such that this term can also be neglected . also note that this term vanishes exactly for antennae located on a line perpendicular to the displacement of the satellite , @xmath101 .",
    "+ by neglecting again corrections of the amplitude of order @xmath72 or higher , the expression of the received electric field at position @xmath8 of the antenna relative to the satellite , expressed in the frame @xmath15 , becomes @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "analyzing expression ( [ elec_field6 ] ) , one realizes that it could have been obtained in a naive way by simply replacing @xmath68 in the far field expression of @xmath36 with the position of the moving satellite as seen in @xmath104 , and keeping the time @xmath66 .",
    "however , even the meaning of the partial time - derivative would have then remained ambiguous : does it apply to @xmath105 or not ? in the formal , rigorous derivation that we have followed here ,",
    "it is clear , that it does not : one first differentiates @xmath106 with respect to @xmath66 and then replaces @xmath66 as indicated .",
    "also , the sequence of well - controlled approximations discussed above opens the way to systematically deriving higher - order corrections , which is clearly not possible in the mentioned `` naive '' approach .",
    "thermal sources at the surface of earth , which are the origin of the thermal noise detected at the position of the satellite , are assimilated to random fluctuations as function of time .",
    "they can be expressed through their spectrum @xmath107 , @xmath108 inserting ( [ j_t ] ) in ( [ elec_field6 ] ) yields @xmath109 the spectrum of the electric field received at the position of the satellite corresponds to the fourier transform of ( [ elec_field7 ] ) , @xmath110 and using the approximation ( [ r3 ] ) , the previous expression becomes @xmath111 by noticing that the only remaining time dependence is in the exponent , the integral over time variable @xmath16 can thus be simplified to @xmath112 where the last expression is once more correct to order @xmath72 . by neglecting again corrections of the electric field amplitude ,",
    "the spectrum of the electric field measured in @xmath15 becomes @xmath113 on board of the satellite , the received electric field typically passes through a filter with filter function @xmath114 .",
    "e.g.  for smos , the spectrum is filtered to a narrow window corresponding to the allowed band of width @xmath115mhz centered at @xmath116ghz .",
    "the retrieved temporal electric field at the output of the filter is expressed through inverse fourier transforming @xmath117 multiplied with the filter function , @xmath118 since the integration over the frequency variable @xmath119 is from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , one can apply the change of variables @xmath122 .",
    "neglecting once more corrections of the amplitude of order @xmath72 or higher , and corrections of the phase of order @xmath123 or higher , this leads to @xmath124 as it was to be expected , the satellite motion generates a doppler shift of the frequency of the sources .",
    "the doppler shift appears in the expression of the filtered electric field by means of a shift of the frequency of the filter function and the appearance of the phase factor @xmath125 .",
    "the doppler shift to linear order in @xmath72 is clearly a purely longitudinal one , as is well - known .",
    "a transverse ( i.e.  purely relativistic ) doppler shift would appear at second order in @xmath72 .",
    "we define the correlation ( also called the visibility function ) of the electric fields in the frame @xmath15 fixed to the satellite as @xmath126 the thermal sources at the surface of earth can be modeled by gaussian stochastic processes that are uncorrelated for different frequencies and positions @xcite , @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 refer to the correlation length and the correlation time , respectively .",
    "+ the averages in ( [ corr_func ] ) and ( [ fdt_theo ] ) are in principle over an ensemble of different realizations of the noise processes , but , assuming ergodicity , they may be replaced by a time average .",

    "+ in the standard derivation of the theorem , sources and observer are taken at rest with respect to each other , and only electric fields observed at the same time ( with respect to the observer reference  frame ) but at different positions are correlated . we recover the standard form of the vczt when setting @xmath149 , and considering a small bandwidth , @xmath150 .",
    "the latter condition allows one to approximate the @xmath151-function by @xmath152 .",
    "the speed of the satellite @xmath153 has disappeared from the expression already in ( [ corr_func_3 ] ) with the cancellation of the doppler shift and the phase related to the virtual baseline created by the displacement of the satellite during time @xmath147 .",

    "our study therefore extends the validity of the standard form ( [ vcz ] ) of the van cittert ",
    "zernike theorem to the case of an observer moving with constant speed with respect to the sources .",
    "+ the cancellation of the phases due to the doppler shift and the virtual baseline shows that it is not possible to create a temporal aperture synthesis by correlating the observed time - dependent electric fields delayed by the travel time of the satellite in the direction of the virtual baseline .",

    "_ a rapidly oscillating phase factor .",
    "the first effect results from the sinc - term . if @xmath154 , the term due to @xmath147 in the argument of the sinc is up to a factor @xmath155 larger than the second one .",
    "the second one , on the other hand , has to be of order one if the spatial aperture in the direction of the real baseline @xmath156 is supposed to work .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the correlation function is suppressed by a factor @xmath157 relative to the standard case with @xmath149 .",
    "the rapidly oscillating phase factor is given by @xmath158 .",
    "this phase overwhelms the information in the cross - track direction contained in the phase @xmath159 .",
    "thus , while the hope of being able to use the virtual baseline created by a moving satellite for imaging purposes through correlating the time - dependent fields shifted only by the travel time over the virtual baseline is disappointed , our derivation justifies the neglect of the doppler effect in existing satellite - based passive radiometers based on the standard van cittert  zernike theorem @xcite .",
    "we have examined the possibility of temporal aperture synthesis for satellite - based passive microwave observation of earth , where a virtual baseline is created by the motion of the satellite in order to enhance the spatial resolution .",
    "our study shows that the interesting phase information in the along - track direction obtained from a time shift of the fields corresponding to the travel time over the virtual baseline is exactly canceled by the first order ( longitudinal ) doppler effect .",
    "furthermore , the time shift yields a large uncompensated frequency - dependent phase overwhelming the information in the cross - track direction , and a drastic reduction of the amplitude of the correlation function .",
    "therefore , by correlating in this way the time - dependent signals received by a 1d antennae array with pixel - independent shifts corresponding only to the travel time of the satellite , one can not reconstruct the brilliance temperature in both along- and cross - track directions .",
    "+ nevertheless , our result ( [ corr_func_4 ] ) constitutes a generalization of the van cittert ",
