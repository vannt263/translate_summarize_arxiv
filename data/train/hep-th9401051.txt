    "<S> in this paper we give a new derivation of the quark - antiquark potential in the wilson loop context . </S>",
    "<S> this makes more explicit the approximations involved and enables an immediate extension to the three - quark case . in the @xmath0 case we find the same semirelativistic potential obtained in preceding papers but for a question of ordering . in the @xmath1 case </S>",
    "<S> we find a spin dependent potential identical to that already derived in the literature from the ad hoc and non correct assumption of scalar confinement . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we obtain the correct form of the spin independent potential up to the @xmath2 order . </S>"
