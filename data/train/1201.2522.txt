    "clearly , the change of the original problems with the sub - problems usually results some error , called _ splitting error_.",

    "however in the practical computations in many cases we require splittings of higher order accuracy .      in the following we introduce a weighted sequential splitting method , which is based on two sequential splitting methods with different ordering of the operators",
