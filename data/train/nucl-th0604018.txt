    "in what follows we concentrate on a set of 121 spherical even - even nuclei ( ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) .",
    "we started from a mean field calculated in the hf approximation , according to the procedure followed by goriely et al .",
    "in particular , we made use of the skyrme - type msk7 interaction , adding a phenomenological wigner term in order to take into account neutron - proton correlations in nuclei having nearly equal number of neutrons and protons .",
    "the pairing channel was treated in the bcs approximation using a zero - range interaction @xmath2 in which we allow the pairing strength parameter @xmath3 to be different for neutrons and protons and with an energy cutoff corresponding to one major shell ( @xmath4 mev ) .",
    "hfbcs solutions were computed in a box of 16 fm radius , making use of a radial mesh of 0.1 fm .",
    "we then focused on the effect of correlations on the binding energies .",
    "the contribution associated with surface vibrations has been calculated in the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) , according to the expression @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the energies of the n - th qrpa phonons of multipolarity @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the backwardsgoing amplitudes ( associated with the corresponding vibrational modes of energy @xmath6 ) and the sums over @xmath9 and @xmath10 run on qrpa quasiparticle indices ( on rpa particle and hole indices for nuclei which are not superfluid ) .",
    "we do nt consider here other important renormalization effects , e.g. self - energy effects , which affect the value of the effective mass ( @xmath11 in the case of the msk7 interaction ) and the position of single - particle levels and level densities . in qrpa calculations , using the same interactions adopted in the hf+bcs mean field , @xmath12 and @xmath13 vibrations have been calculated using a space dimension ranging from 40 mev for the heaviest isotopes to 64 mev for the lightest ones , exhausting the energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "only the most collective low - lying qrpa phonons have been considered for the computation of correlation energies .",
    "the selection of the most collective phonons is achieved taking into account only those qrpa states with a reduced transition probability greater than 2% of non - energy weighted sum rule , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ; for what concerns the individualization of the low - lying states , the fragmentation of the qrpa response imposes a case by case analysis , but a simple rule came out : quadrupolar ( octupolar ) states up to 7 mev ( 5 mev ) contributed to the calculation of correlation energies , except for some nuclei ( namely , ar , ca , ti , zr ) for which we took into account quadrupolar ( octupolar ) states up to 10 mev ( 7 mev ) .    pairing vibrations ( see @xcite,@xcite ) were treated in rpa . while it is true that well developed pairing vibrational bands based on doubly closed nuclei have been observed ( e.g. in the case of @xmath14pb , see @xcite ) , one expects pairing collectivity to be important also for systems with few nucleons outside closed shells . however , the correlation energy associated with pairing vibrations is calculated only on shell closures , while the correlations associated with pairing in open shell nuclei have been taken into account by means of the bcs approach . in any case , the above is an approximation which , if needed , can be removed from the calculation scheme .",
    "single particle levels have been computed using a woods - saxon potential with standard parametrization @xcite .",
    "a separable pairing interaction with constant matrix elements has been used to compute monopole pairing vibration contributions . in all calculations",
    "we have kept the contribution of only the lowest ( @xmath15 ) pair addition and pair subtraction modes , in keeping with the fact that , as a rule , the @xmath16 modes are much less collective .",
    "the values of the associated pairing strengths in a specific nucleus have been computed as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see note @xcite ) . for neutron pairing vibrations",
    "the pairing strength has been computed in double closed shell nuclei and the resulting value has been used for isotopes with the same magic number of neutrons ( @xmath17o,@xmath18ca,@xmath19ca,@xmath20sn,@xmath14pb for n=8,20,28,82,126 respectively ) , while for n=50 the value has been computed in @xmath21zr . for isotopic chains with magic atomic number , the correlation energy due to proton pairing vibrations has been calculated only for selected isotopes ( @xmath22o,@xmath18ca,@xmath19ca,@xmath23sn,@xmath24sn,@xmath14pb for z=8,20,50,82 ) and then interpolated for the rest of the chain .",

    "the r.m.s .",
    "deviation @xmath27 we obtain for this set of 121 nuclei is 0.724 mev .",
    "note that the parameters of the skyrme force used are slightly different from the msk7 developed by goriely et al . in @xcite .",
    "we started with the msk7 parametrization and , with the aid of a linear refit ( which will be discussed below ) , we fitted the skyrme parameters to the experimental binding energies of this set of 121 isotopes .",
    "the resulting parametrization was used as a starting point of the present work @xcite .",
    "the shell structure dependence of the results is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 10 ] . at variance with the results reported in ref . @xcite obtained making use of the sly4 skyrme parametrization , magic number nuclei are not , in our calculations , regularly overbound with respect to their neighbours . in fact , @xmath18ca,@xmath19ca and @xmath14pb ( indicated by the arrows in the plot ) are examples of magic nuclei which are underbound with respect to near isotopes , while for n=132 some opposite cases are observed .",
    "surface and pairing correlation energies are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 20 ] .",
    "low - lying surface vibrations show , as expected , a marked collectivity for all the isotopes calculated .",
    "these corrections tend to bind magic nuclei less than their neighbours ( compare fig . [",
    "fig : art2 20 ] for the neutron shell closures at @xmath28 ) . on the other hand",
    "pairing vibrations contributions show the opposite behaviour , providing magic nuclei with an important extra binding energy .",
    "the sum of the two contributions is displayed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 20 ] . the differences which can be found between the results presented in ref . @xcite and those presented in this work arise from the inclusion in the previous paper of quadrupole and hexadecapole pairing vibrations and from the fixing of some computational errors .    after adding surface and pairing correlations to mean field binding energies , a refit of the skyrme parameters is needed in order to minimize the rms deviation ( [ eq : art2 8 ] ) . after a first refit of the parameters one should recompute all nuclei in the mean field approximation and",
    "also recompute the correlations .",
    "since a full fit of the skyrme interaction to the experimental binding energies is too costly , we will follow here the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , readjusting perturbatively the parameters of the force @xcite .",
    "this implies that the new interaction will be , in the parameters space , rather similar to the original mf interaction .",
    "thus , qrpa correlations are expected to change little under the refitting process .",
    "this is the reason why we leave unchanged the correlation energy contributions coming from qrpa .    in the case of surface vibrations ,",
    "we have compared our results with those recently obtained by bender et al . .",
    "we started from their mean field binding energies computed with the sly4 skyrme interaction within the hf+bcs framework for the 121 isotopes studied in the present paper ; these binding energies display a rms deviation from the experimental values of 2.45 ( 1.54 ) mev before ( after ) a refit procedure is performed ( see below for a brief explanation or @xcite for a more detailed one ) . if one computes the correlation energies obtained projecting on good angular momentum ( @xmath29 ) , as the authors of @xcite did , and adds these corrections to the mean field binding energies one obtains ( after refitting ) a rms deviation of 1.45 mev . if instead one adds the surface correlation energies showed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 20 ] , one obtains a rms deviation of 1.46 mev .    in what follows",
    "we give a brief description of the perturbative refit performed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the mean field skyrme energy functional is decomposed into a sum of integrals @xmath30 , each of which is weighted by some linear combination @xmath31 of the skyrme parameters @xmath32 these integrals @xmath30 and the mean field binding energies are sufficient to perform the refit of the interaction .",
    "since certain linear combinations of the skyrme parameters are not determined by nuclear masses , one should not include them in the fit . according to @xcite",
    "only four combinations are well fixed by the binding energies .",
    "the refit procedure is linear in these integrals @xmath30 and one can vary the @xmath31 coefficients in order to minimize the rms deviation between theoretical and experimental binding energies .",
    "we tested the linearity of the procedure recomputing the binding energies with the new parameters and comparing these energies to those obtained exploiting the linearity , finding excellent agreement .",
    "the results obtained after performing the refitting procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 50 ] .",
    "the rms deviation for the refit of mean field plus surface and pairing correlations is 0.714 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 50 ] ) , very close to the mean field value ( 0.724 mev ) .",
    "it can be seen that adding the negative correlations has increased the deviation of the calculated masses from the experimental data for a few specific isotopic chains , which are now systematically overbound ( cf .",
    "for example the oxygen isotopes , indicated by an arrow in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 50 ] ) , notwithstanding the refitting procedure .",
    "to gain perspective concerning this point , it is worth stepping back and looking at what happens when the ground state correlation energies are added to the isotopic chains studied , without carrying out the refitting procedure .",
    "it is seen that , adding the correlation energy contributions , the deviation between theory and experiment for some of the nuclear chains studied displays a flatter isotopic dependence .",
    "an index of this flattening is provided by the rms deviation calculated with respect to the average deviation of the single isotopic chain . in other words , for the @xmath33 isotopic chain @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average deviation @xmath36    the values of @xmath37 for all the 21 isotopic chains studied are displayed in table [ table : art2 10 ] .",
    "it can be seen that in many cases ( 13 out of 21 ) @xmath37 decreases compared to the mean field value , mostly due to the effect of pairing vibrations .",
    "the effect of surface vibrations alone is to increase @xmath37 compared to the mean field value in 16 chains out of 21 . the total value of @xmath37 for all the isotopic chains , defined by the expression @xmath38 decreases by about 6% from 0.532 mev for the mf calculation to the corrected mean field ( 0.502 mev ) .    in keeping with this finding",
    ", we have added to mean field only the fluctuations of the qrpa correlations .",
    "that is , we added to each isotope the difference @xmath39 between its correlation energy and the average correlation energy of the isotopic chain it belongs to .",
    "this procedure clearly cancels out the information related to the absolute value of the computed correlation energies , but keeps the , arguably , more important information concerning the isotopic dependence of these energies . in this context",
    ", we can remark that while the absolute value of the correlation energies associated with collective surface vibrations depends on the choice of the energy of the phonons which contribute to these correlation energies , the isotopic dependence is much more stable .",
    "this is because the properties of giant resonance modes change little along a given isotopic chain .",
    "consequently , adding the fluctuations @xmath39 to mf selects the most stable fraction of the contributions associated with ground state correlation energies .",
    "the results obtained after refitting are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : art2 50 ] . the rms deviation is now 0.691 mev .",
    ".rms deviations @xmath37 of calculated ground state energy from experimental values are shown .",
    "these deviations are calculated with respect to the average deviation for each isotopic chain ( see eqs . [",
    "eq : art2 10 ] and [ eq : art2 20 ] ) .",
    "the table displays : the mass number range ( 1st column ) , the number of isotopes calculated ( 2nd ) , the mean field rmsd @xmath37 ( 3rd ) , the rmsd obtained adding the contribution of surface vibrations to the mean field ground state energy ( 4th ) , the rmsd obtained adding the contributions from pairing vibrations as well ( 5th ) .",

    "we have performed a systematic analysis of the contribution of medium polarization effects associated with collective surface and pairing vibrations on the binding energies of even - even spherical nuclei .",
    "we have started from a hf+bcs mean field calculation based on a skyrme - type interaction , obtaining a rms deviation of 0.724 mev with respect to experimental masses .",
    "then we have added the correlation energy associated with low - lying surface and pairing vibrational modes ( calculated in the qrpa and rpa approximation respectively ) which typically increases the calculated binding energies by a few mev .",
    "subsequently we performed a linear refit of the parameters of the interaction in order to obtain the best agreeement with the experiment .",
    "although this refit procedure had some difficulties in minimizing the rms deviation of binding energies ( some isotopic chains turned out to be systematically overbound ) , we obtained in most isotopic chains a flattening of the deviations of the binding energies from the experiment . adding the fluctuations of the correlation energies , losing the information related to their absolute value , the linear refit was able to find a new set of skyrme parameters which gives a rms deviation of 0.691 mev ( that is , a reduction of about 4.5% from the mean field treatment ) .    in order to improve the results achieved , we tried to better study some critical chains .",
    "for example the calcium isotopes , whose deviations from experimental binding energies turned out to be insensitive to the addition of the correlation energies considered , and which contribute in an important way to the total rmsd .",
    "we have been able to improve the description of calcium and lead isotopes including the correlations associated with quadrupole pairing vibrations .",
    "this reduced the rms deviation for all 121 isotopes to 0.667 mev ( corresponding to about 8% reduction with respect to the mf rmsd ) .",
    "the reduction obtained is not strong , but it is sufficient to justify the effort made in going beyond the mean field approach .",
    "the improvement gained by the specific study performed on ca and pb isotopes can suggest that studying certain chains in more detail can allow us to learn something that could be useful to build a general prescription .",
    "concerning surface vibrations correlations , we also compared our results with what was obtained by bender et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite with the projection on good angular momentum and obtained a very good agreement , pointing to the question of how much the details of the calculation count .",
    "our results show that , for the set of isotopes studied , the degrees of freedom we investigated can help us in improving the mass formula built on a self - consistent mean field .",
    "however , our investigation was limited by the adopted refitting procedure , which made a perturbative survey of the parameters space , tying the results obtained to the starting skyrme parametrization .",
    "further investigations should adopt a more general refitting procedure , exploring a larger region of the parameter space .",
    "doing such a costly search for a better minimum of the rms norm would also imply that at every step one should re - calculate the mean field binding energies and also the correlation energies , because a larger change of the parameters implies that these correlation energies can show a no more negligible variation .",
    "we conclude emphasizing that the aim of this work is not to achieve a mass formula with a very low rms deviation from experimental findings , but to investigate the effects of some degrees of freedom of the nuclear system which have to be taken into account ( namely , surface and pairing vibrations ) .",
