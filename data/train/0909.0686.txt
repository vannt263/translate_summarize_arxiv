    "we introduce a weaker type of decomposition in which we no longer require the summands to be submodules of @xmath0 , but only vector spaces isomorphic to polynomial subrings .",

    "@xmath21 is defined accordingly .    since",
    "stanley decompositions are hilbert decompositions , the latter set upper bounds to the existence of stanley decompositions , and since they are easier to find , one may try to construct a stanley decomposition by appropriately modifying a `` good '' hilbert decomposition .",
    "moreover , our discussion shows that it is worthwhile to also consider the standard grading along with the multigrading , as already suggested implicitly by stanley , who allows arbitrary gradings in his conjecture . in order to distinguish multigraded and standard graded invariants",
    ", we use the indices @xmath10 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "all this is made precise in section  [ stanhilb ] .",
    "in addition , in the same section , we collect several useful results from the literature that are proved in a concise way , some of which in an extended form .",
    "while most papers are devoted to the case in which multigraded components have @xmath2-dimension @xmath23 ( and in which hilbert decompositions and stanley decompositions coincide under a mild hypothesis ) , we test our notions on the syzygy modules of the residue class field of @xmath1 $ ] ( as usual identified with @xmath2 ) .",

    "the further investigations reveal a significant difference between the `` lower '' syzygy modules @xmath3 , @xmath27 , and the `` upper '' ones . for the upper ones , one can easily determine the multigraded hilbert depth : if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , which is the best possible value for a nonfree module .",
    "we believe that the multigraded stanley depth has the same value , and show that this holds for @xmath30 ( in addition to @xmath31 ) .    in the lower range",
    ", it seems impossible to find a simple expression even for @xmath32 , since the binomial sum that must be evaluated for a precise bound ( see proposition  [ summation ] and remark  [ rem : imposs ] ) can not be summed in closed form .",
    "the best we can offer in section  [ asympt ] ( apart from experimental values for @xmath33 ) is asymptotic estimates for @xmath34 as @xmath10 becomes large .",
    "we consider two  regimes \" : if @xmath4 is fixed and @xmath10 tends to @xmath35 , then theorem  [ thm : regimea ] provides a rather precise asymptotic approximation , showing in particular that the lower bound @xmath36 has the correct leading asymptotic order , although it is still rather far away from the true value .",
