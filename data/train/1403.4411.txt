    "disordered face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 and fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 alloys have remained at the forefront of condensed matter theory for more than sixty years , owing to their rich variety of intriguing physical properties .",
    "their linear thermal expansion coefficient ( ltec ) , @xmath11 , is anomalously small @xmath12 $ ] over a wide range of temperature @xcite , a phenomenon known as the invar effect .",
    "their spontaneous volume magnetostriction , @xmath13 , measured at @xmath14 greatly exceeds that in body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) fe and fcc ni @xcite .",
    "their reduced magnetostriction , @xmath15 , scales with the square of the reduced magnetization , @xmath16^{2}$ ] , up to a temperature near the curie temperature , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , only one of these two ferromagnets , namely fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 , shows a peculiar thermal dependence of the reduced magnetization @xcite .    understanding all of the abovementioned phenomena within one framework is still a major open challenge .",
    "the most common theoretical explanation for the invar effect involves the so - called 2@xmath18-state model , where the iron atoms can switch between two magnetic states with different atomic volumes as the temperature is raised @xcite .",
    "this theory , however , seems incompatible with the results of mssbauer @xcite and neutron experiments @xcite .",
    "another popular explanation emphasizes the importance of non - collinearity of the local magnetic moments on iron sites @xcite , though experiments undertaken to detect such non - collinearity have not found it @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario with a purely magnetic origin for the invar effect has been proposed @xcite : the phenomenon is caused by anomalous thermal evolution of the magnitude of fe moments .",
    "it is supported by a recent work on iron - platinum alloys @xcite which involves _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations and the disordered local moment ( dlm ) model @xcite .",
    "however , the method employed in @xcite can not be extended to iron - nickel alloys .",
    "thus , it is unable to provide a unified picture for the invar effect in fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 and fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 and another treatment is called for .",
    "a theoretical framework @xcite has recently been designed to address the spontaneous magnetization , the spontaneous volume magnetostriction , and their relationship in fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 and fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 in the temperature interval @xmath19 . taking a similar approach as in @xcite and @xcite , alloys in equilibrium at temperature @xmath20",
    "have been modelled by random substitutional alloys in homogeneous ferromagnetic ( fm ) states , partially disordered local moment ( pdlm ) states , or dlm states depending on the fraction of fe moments which are antiferromagnetically aligned with the magnetization at @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the procedure could be divided into the following three stages . in the first stage , physical properties of interest ( volume and magnetization )",
    "have been calculated for fm ( @xmath22 ) , pdlm ( @xmath23 ) , and dlm ( @xmath24 ) states using _ ab initio _ dft . in the second stage",
    ", the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down has been determined by noticing that an accurate description of the reduced magnetization is provided by a function of this form @xmath25^{q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and assuming that @xmath5 obeys the following equation @xmath26 \\bigg [ 1- \\left ( \\frac{t}{t_{\\rm c } } \\right)^{p } \\bigg]^{q}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the third and final step , the outputs from the previous steps have been combined to explore how the magnetization and the magnetostriction vary as the system is heated . direct comparison between simulations results and experimental measurements",
    "has provided validation for the approach .",
    "the study supports the following ideas .",
    "the alloys at @xmath14 share several physical properties : the magnetization in a pdlm state collapses as the fraction of fe moments which point down increases , following closely @xmath27 while the volume shrinks , following closely @xmath28 x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow } ( 1-x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow});\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the volume in the fm state greatly exceeds that in the dlm state ; @xmath29 is close to 0 .",
    "these common properties can account for a variety of intriguing phenomena displayed by both alloys , including the anomaly in the magnetostriction at @xmath14 and , more surprisingly perhaps , the scaling between the reduced magnetostriction and the reduced magnetization squared below the curie temperature .",
    "however , the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down depends strongly on the alloy under consideration .",
    "this , in turn , can explain the observed marked difference in the temperature dependence of the reduced magnetization between the two alloys .",

    "this makes them particularly attractive for testing our general approach , identifying conditions under which an alloy shows the invar effect , and investigating the mechanism of the invar phenomenon . in principle",
    ", the ltec can be derived from the configuration - averaged free energy which depends explicitly on volume and temperature . in practice ,",
    "application of dft to _ ab initio _ calculations of a finite - temperature average free energy remains difficult , even in the adiabatic approximation where the electronic , the vibrational , and the magnetic contributions are treated separately .",

    ", the bulk modulus for the fm state lies within 175 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with measurements performed on fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 and ni @xcite .",
    "the effect of raising @xmath5 on the bulk modulus @xmath72 mirrors to a certain extent that seen in panel  ( a ) for the volume @xmath68 : ( i ) the bulk modulus decreases in the invar alloys , revealing that these materials become easier to squeeze .",

    "a useful way to analyze these data is as follows .",

    "then the material would not exhibit the invar effect .",
    "this would also be the case if all of the curves @xmath80 for @xmath81 superimposed @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "in reality , however , raising the temperature from @xmath83 to @xmath84 causes the material to demagnetize , and the value of @xmath5 changes accordingly .",

    "this is shown as a dashed line .",
    "insofar as panel  ( b ) allows us to judge for fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 , each hop is to a curve lower than the last , cancelling the upward trend of each individual curve : this is the essence of the invar effect . in section  [ resultsb ] ,",
    "we present a necessary condition under which an alloy shows the invar effect .",
    "consistent with the analysis of figure  [ figure2 ] , the criterion involves @xmath87 .    in panel  ( a ) of figure  [ figure3 ]",
    ", we plot the calculated anomalous contribution to the ltec @xmath58 against the reduced temperature for fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 , fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 , and fe@xmath31ni@xmath32 .",
    "irrespective of the material under consideration , @xmath58 exhibits a negative sign opposite to @xmath60 .",
    "however , only the fe - rich materials possess the exceptional property that @xmath58 compensates for @xmath60 in a wide temperature range .",
    "thus the approach predicts the occurrence of the invar effect in fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 and fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 and its absence in fe@xmath31ni@xmath32 .",
    "this perfectly matches experimental findings @xcite .",
    "to further evaluate the predictive power of the method , we compare the calculated renormalized anomalous contribution to the ltec @xmath88 with experimental observations @xcite for the invar alloys in panel  ( b ) of figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "note that we extract the calculated values for @xmath89 - v(0,1/2 ) \\ } / v(0,1/2)$ ] from figure  [ figure2 ] and obtain 2.29% for fe@xmath7pt@xmath8 and 3.03% for fe@xmath9ni@xmath10 .",
    "panel  ( b ) of figure  [ figure3 ] reveals a good quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments .",

    "features in the structural behaviour of the materials which have been observed experimentally ( see figure  [ figure3 ] ) , but have remained unexplained , can now be interpreted on the basis of the abovementioned insight and our theoretical results displayed in figure  [ figure4 ] : ( i ) the drop in the anomalous contribution to the ltec in fe@xmath103ni@xmath104 at @xmath105 when the nickel concentration is reduced from 0.8 to 0.35 arises from the steep decrease of the product of the magnetostructural coupling @xmath106 $ ] and the magnetic term @xmath66 .",
