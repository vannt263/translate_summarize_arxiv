    "the study of nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering has a long history and remains of interest due to both successes and failures that mark it ( see for example , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is an important subject _ per se _ , and is also important as a tool for the description of a series of phenomena that involve the distorted waves given by optical model potentials ( omp ) .",
    "we are searching here for reliable ways to predict optical model potentials for reactions with radioactive nuclear beams ( rnb ) .",
    "in particular our interest focuses on finding reliable descriptions for transfer reactions involving relatively light , loosely bound nuclei , which are used in indirect methods in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "a range of rnb studies were made at energies around 10 mev / nucleon , where the reactions are peripheral , with the intent to obtain information about the surface of the nuclei involved .",
    "these reactions use dwba techniques to extract nuclear structure information .",
    "however , the well known existence of many ambiguities in the omps extracted from elastic scattering can raise questions about the accuracy of these determinations .",
    "therefore , we are searching for ways to reduce these ambiguities and to predict omp for reactions with rnbs . experimental studies using rnbs",
    "have , heretofore , not been suitable for detailed elastic scattering analyses .",
    "the closest we can get using stable beams is by studying the elastic scattering of loosely bound nuclei .",
    "we chose here to study the elastic scattering of @xmath0li projectiles , because they are fragile ( loosely bound ) , with a pronounced cluster structure and with low z and can , therefore , exhibit a range of phenomena , involving absorption , diffraction and refraction , mostly of nuclear nature .",
    "earlier we have carried out a study of elastic scattering around 10a mev for a range of projectile - target combinations involving @xmath5-shell nuclei trache00 .",
    "we found a relatively simple method to predict omp for loosely bound nuclei , based on the renormalization of the independent real and imaginary terms obtained from a double folding procedure using the jlm nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) effective interaction .",
    "the procedure successfully described the data for all the projectile - target combinations and the energies in the study for most of the angular ranges measured .",
    "in one single case ( @xmath2li at 99 and 130 mev on @xmath4c ) the folding potentials failed to describe well the large angle data .",
    "later , the results were used to describe elastic scattering angular distributions measured in a series of experiments with rnbs at or around 10 mev / nucleon : @xmath2be on @xmath6b and melamine targets @xcite , @xmath7c @xcite , @xmath1n tang04 and @xmath8f @xcite on @xmath4c and @xmath9n targets .",
    "we return to that study here with new data extending the angular ranges for the @xmath2li scattering and adding data for @xmath10li scattering and with a refined analysis .",
    "recent work @xcite has established that elastic scattering of light tightly bound heavy ion systems such as @xmath11o+@xmath4c and @xmath11o+@xmath11o show sufficient transparency for the cross section to be dominated by the far - side scattering .",
    "intermediate angle structures appearing in the elastic scattering distributions at angles beyond the fraunhofer diffractive region have been identified as airy minima of a nuclear rainbow , i.e. a destructive interference between two far - side trajectories which sample the interior of the potential .",
    "a number of high order airy minima have been identified by observing that such structures are largely insensitive to an artificial reduction of the absorption in the optical potential , and therefore they appear as a manifestation of the refractive power of the nuclear potential . while at high energy @xcite this picture was well substantiated by a semiclassical nonuniform decomposition of the scattering function @xcite , at lower energies",
    "the situation is more difficult to understand .",
    "it has been shown by anni @xcite , that such structures could be explained by the interference of two amplitudes appearing in different terms of a multireflection uniform series expansion of the scattering amplitude and therefore the interpretation using rainbow terminology is not appropriate .    for loosely bound nuclei",
    "the situation is even more uncertain .",
    "when a nucleon or a group of nucleons has small separation energy , the wave function penetrates well beyond the potential range .",
    "the corresponding components in the optical potential are expected to be more diffuse as compared to normal nuclei , leading to a competition between the increased refractive power of the real potential and the increased absorption at the nuclear surface .",
    "the small separation energy implies also that the dynamic polarization potential ( dpp ) @xcite arising from the coupling to breakup states may be strong and with a complicated energy and radial dependence .",
    "it follows that for loosely bound nuclei the dpp can not be treated as a small perturbation and the usual phenomenological procedure in renormalizing the folding potential form factor may be questioned .",
    "it has been estimated that the dpp is strongly repulsive at the nuclear surface in the case of @xmath10li @xcite and this prompted mahaux , ngo and satchler @xcite to conjecture that for loosely bound nuclei the barrier anomaly may be absent due to the cancellation between the repulsive ( dpp ) and attractive ( dispersive ) components of the optical potential .    in the specific case of @xmath0li scattering on light targets a large body of data",
    "have been accumulated in the range 5 - 50 mev / nucleon . at high energy , nadasen and his group @xcite",
    "have been able to derive a unique optical potential which was essential to assess the quality of the folding model . at lower energies , ambiguities found in the analysis of data prevented any definite conclusion about the strength and energy dependence of the optical potential .",
    "a study by trcka _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite on @xmath10li+@xmath4c elastic scattering at 50 mev , found an exotic feature ( `` plateau '' ) in the angular distribution of the elastic scattering at intermediate angles which resembles similar structures found in more bound systems .",
    "they interpreted the structure as a diffractive effect arising from an angular momentum dependent absorption .",
    "there are experimental hints that such structures also  appear in neighboring systems , @xmath10li+@xmath11o and @xmath10li+@xmath12be , as a possible manifestation of the average properties of the interaction potential .    in this paper",
    "we present a precision measurement of elastic scattering of @xmath0li on @xmath13c and @xmath12be targets at 9 and 19 mev / nucleon .",
    "the lower energy was chosen in view of our systematic studies of nuclear reactions for astrophysics .",
    "the higher energy is close to the saturation energy for these projectiles , i.e. the energy where almost all reaction channels are open .",
    "the `` plateau '' feature is confirmed in four projectile - target combinations at 9 mev / nucleon .",
    "the high selectivity induced by this structure allowed the derivation of an almost unique woods - saxon optical potential . a folding model analysis using the complex , density and energy dependent nn interaction of jeukenne , lejeune and mahaux ( jlm ) @xcite , where corrections due to the strong dpp have been included , confirmed that our elastic distributions could be described using deep and extremely transparent potentials .",
    "the remaining ambiguities have been eliminated using an accurate dispersion relation analysis .",
    "the intermediate angle structures have been discussed using the semiclassical uniform approximation for the scattering function of brink and takigawa brink2 .",
    "we explain the intermediate angle structure as a coherent interference effect of two subamplitudes corresponding to trajectories reflected at the barrier and interfering with trajectories which sample the nuclear interior .",
    "thus , this refractive effect appears as a signature of a highly transparent interaction potential .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : after this introduction , the experimental methods are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the analysis of the elastic scattering data using phenomenological and microscopic optical model potentials is discussed in sect .",

    "the experiments were performed using @xmath10li and @xmath2li beams of 9 and 19 mev / nucleon from the texas a&m university k500 superconducting cyclotron and the multipole dipole multipole ( mdm ) magnetic spectrometer @xcite .",
    "a list of the measurements is given in table tabexp .",
    "the measurements with @xmath2li were done to extend the angular range that was effectively covered in earlier work . the experimental setup and",
    "the data reduction procedures were similar to those used in ref .",
    "the beams were prepared using the beam analysis system @xcite , which allows for the control of the energy spread ( @xmath14 up to 1/2500 ) and angular spread ( @xmath15 ) of the beam .",
    "self - supported @xmath16be ( 200 @xmath17g/@xmath18 thick ) , @xmath19c ( 260 @xmath17g/@xmath18 ) and @xmath1c ( 390 @xmath17g/@xmath18 ) targets were placed perpendicular to the beam in the target chamber of the mdm .",
    "the magnetic field of the mdm spectrometer was set to transport the fully stripped li ions to the focal plane where they were observed in the modified oxford detector @xcite . in the detector ,",
    "the position of the particles along the dispersive direction was measured with resistive wires at four different depths , separated by about 16 cm each . for particle identification we used the specific energy loss measured in the ionization chamber and the residual energy measured in a ne102a plastic scintillator located behind the output window of the detector .",
    "the input and output windows of the detector were made of 1.8 and 7.2 mg/@xmath18 thick kapton foils , respectively .",
    "the ionization chamber was filled with pure isobutane at @xmath20 torr .",
    "the entire horizontal acceptance of the spectrometer , @xmath21 , and a restricted vertical opening , @xmath22 , were used in the measurements at forward angles , whereas at the largest angles the vertical opening of the acceptance window was raised to  @xmath23 .",
    "raytracing was used to reconstruct the scattering angle . for this purpose ,",
    "position calibration of the detector was performed by using the scattering on a thin au target ( 212 @xmath17g/@xmath18 ) and an angle mask consisting of five openings of @xmath24=0.1@xmath25 located at -1.6@xmath26 , -0.8@xmath26 , 0@xmath26 , + 0.8@xmath26 and + 1.6@xmath26 relative to the central angle of the spectrometer .",
    "in addition to raytrace @xcite calculations , angle calibration data were obtained at several angles by using the angle mask .",
    "typically the spectrometer was moved by @xmath27 or @xmath28 at a time , allowing for an angle overlap that provided a self - consistency check of the data .",
    "normalization of the data was done using current integration in a faraday cup .",
    "focal plane reconstruction was done at each angle using the position measured with the signals in the wire nearest to the focal plane and using the detector angle obtained from the position measured at two of the four wires ( typically the first and last ) .",
    "the angular range , @xmath29 , covered by the acceptance slit was divided into 8 bins , resulting in 8 points in the angular distribution being measured simultaneously , with each integrating over @xmath30 .    the measurements with the angle mask showed that the resolution in the scattering angle ( laboratory ) was @xmath31 full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "this includes a contribution from the angular spread of the beam of about @xmath15 .",
    "the best energy resolution obtained at forward angles was 150 kev fwhm .",
    "it degraded as we advanced to larger angles due to the large kinematic factor , @xmath32 , coupled with the finite angular spread in the beam .",
    "however , it never degraded our ability to isolate the elastic peak , even in the case of the @xmath2li experiments where the first excited state of the projectile is only 477 kev away .",
    "the active length of the focal plane allowed us to cover a total excitation energy of about 7 mev , centered around the elastic peak .",
    "thus we were able to measure inelastic scattering to the lowest excited states of the projectile - target systems at the same time .",
    "these inelastic scattering data were used as additional information to check the experimental procedures . in one of the runs we have also measured the neutron transfer reaction @xmath1c(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath4c at e(@xmath2li)=63 mev , which was discussed elsewhere in detail @xcite and is used here to check the sensitivity of observables in other channels to the omp extracted from the elastic scattering data .    to obtain accurate absolute values for the cross sections , target thickness and charge collection factors were determined by a two - target method as described in ref .",
    "we also determined the target thickness by measuring the energy loss of alpha particles from a @xmath33th source and the accuracy in normalization is 9% . combining the results of these independent determinations , we conclude that we have an overall normalization accuracy of 7% for the absolute values of the cross sections .",
    "the measured elastic data at 9 mev / nucleon , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ws ] as the ratio to the rutherford cross section , extend to a larger angular range than previously measured @xcite .",
    "these data show complex forms with characteristic rapid oscillations at small angles followed by a marked change in shape at intermediate angles : a plateau is developed at @xmath34 followed by a deep minimum at @xmath35 . assuming pure fraunhofer scattering at forward angles , we extract a grazing angular momentum @xmath3615 from the angular spacing @xmath37 .",
    "the striking fact is that the same pattern emerges for all four projectile - target combinations , including that for the @xmath12be target where a much stronger absorption is expected .",
    "( we remind the reader that @xmath12be is a perfect black disc target since it has very low thresholds for breakup into the neutron and alpha channels @xmath38=1.66 mev and @xmath39=2.47 mev , and there are no bound excited states .",
    "these values should be compared with @xmath39=1.47 mev in @xmath10li and @xmath39=2.47 mev in @xmath2li . )",
    "similarities seen in the differential cross sections shown in fig .",
    "fig : ws indicate general wave - mechanical characteristics of the scattering process and average systematic properties of the nuclear interaction .",
    "specific structure effects can be isolated only as small deviations from the normal behavior .",
    "therefore the data are analyzed using optical potentials with conventional woods - saxon ( ws ) form factors for the nuclear term , supplemented with a coulomb potential generated by a uniform charge distribution with a reduced radius fixed to @xmath40=1 fm .",
    "no preference has been found for volume or surface localized absorption and throughout the paper only volume absorption is considered . in the absence of any spin dependent observables , spin - orbit or tensor interactions have been ignored .",
    "ground state reorientation couplings also have been neglected .",
    "the potential is defined by six parameters specifying the depth and geometry of the real and imaginary terms @xmath41where @xmath42 ^{-1 } }   \\label{p2}\\]]and x = v , w stands for the real and imaginary parts of the potentials , respectively .",
    "the number of data points per angular distribution exceeds n=100 points and therefore the usual goodness of fit criteria ( @xmath43 ) normalized to n has been used .",
    "a source of bias was the finite angular acceptance of the detectors ( the 0.5@xmath26 bins , in the present case ) .",
    "the averaging associated with this finite angular resolutions has most effect on the depth of sharp minima .",
    "a few exploratory calculations showed that allowing the normalization to vary did not result in any qualitative changes and did not indicate that any renormalization by more than a few percent would be preferred .",
    "optical parameter sets collected from the literature were used as starting values for the search procedure . in particular the potential om1 of trcka _",
    "@xcite has been extensively tested .",
    "guided by these potentials and by our earlier analysis @xcite a number of some @xmath44 potentials with real volume integrals in the range @xmath45 mev @xmath46 have been generated for each reaction channel , thus exploring the functional woods - saxon space in full detail .",
    "local minima were identified and a complete search on all six parameters determined the best fit potentials .",
    "the plateau feature at the intermediate angles and the sharp decrease in the cross section near @xmath47 could be fitted only with deep potentials with real volume integrals ( per nucleon ) exceeding a critical value @xmath48 300 mev @xmath46 .",
    "there is a consistent preference for potentials with relatively weak imaginary parts with values of @xmath49 around 15 mev except for @xmath2li scattering where somewhat larger values are needed to fit the data .",
    "we systematically find @xmath50 and large diffuseness parameters @xmath51 0.8 fm in agreement with theoretical expectations for loosely bound nuclei @xcite . a grid search procedure on the real depth of the potential allowed to identify discrete ambiguities .",
    "parameters for the first two discrete families are given in table tab1:res_ws .",
    "these are identified by a jump of @xmath52 100 mev @xmath46 from one family to another and almost constant imaginary volume integral . as a consequence",
    ", the total reaction cross section seems to be a well determined observable .",
    "gridding on other ws parameters revealed a continuous ambiguity of the form @xmath53 const , where @xmath54 is the @xmath55 radius of the potential .",
    "the larger the volume integral , the smaller the radius that is required to fit the data .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of a complicated radial dependence of the dynamic polarization potential ( dpp ) which may lead to radii much smaller than the minimal value implied by the folding model ( e.g. , @xmath56 , for a zero range nn effective interaction ) .",
    "however , for each discrete family rather precise values of the @xmath55 radii were required to fit both forward and intermediate angle cross sections .",
    "sometimes more subjective criteria may be used to choose between various ambiguous potentials based upon general theoretical expectations .",
    "for example one may require consistency with the results of analyses of other data for the same system at nearby energies with the expectation that the potential should not change rapidly with mass and energy .",
    "individual elastic data sets possess individual idiosyncrasies which facilitate the inference of a single local potential .",
    "we note that , seemingly , there is a compatibility between all data sets : an optimum potential found for one data set gives already a good fit to the other .",
    "in fact , potentials given as first entry in table [ tab1:res_ws ] were obtained by iterating several times this procedure in an attempt to find a single potential which would simultaneously fit all data at 9 mev / nucleon .",
    "a compromise could be obtained with transparent deep potentials close to @xmath57 225 mev having a strongly refractive core at small radii , surrounded by a weakly absorptive halo .",
    "in fact , examining the ratio @xmath58 @xcite as a function of the radial distance , we found that our potential may by qualified as having internal ( @xmath59 fm ) and surface ( @xmath60 fm ) transparency ( @xmath61 ) but with a pronounced maximum ( @xmath62 ) near the empirical strong absorption radius ( @xmath63 fm ) in agreement with the systematics found in other more bound systems brandan .",
    "the surface localized absorption suggests that the reaction mechanism is dominated by direct reactions .",
    "the relatively large radius of the absorption required by the data is an indication that fusion already sets in the region of the barrier and that fusion is a large component of the total reaction cross section .",
    "a variety of notch tests have been performed to determine the radial sensitivity of the potential .",
    "one test was done using a gaussian spike superimposed on the real potential at a given radius . the resulting influence on the @xmath43 of the fits",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spike ] .",
    "it shows that there is a relatively high sensitivity for radial distances as low as 4 - 6 fm , well inside the strong absorption radius .",
    "deeper inside this radial range , the refractive index , defined as @xmath64 is almost real and reaches values as high as @xmath65 , comparable to that of diamond .",
    "as mentioned already , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the elastic scattering of light heavy ion systems such as @xmath11o+@xmath4c and @xmath11o+ @xmath11o shows sufficient transparency for the cross section to be dominated by far - side scattering .",
    "structures appearing in the elastic scattering angular distributions at intermediate angles have been identified as airy minima of a nuclear rainbow , due to a destructive interference between two far - side trajectories which sample the interior of the potential . at 19 mev / nucleon",
    "the @xmath2li scattering data show rapid , diffractive fraunhofer oscillations at small angles due to the strong near - far amplitude interference ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ws130 ] ) . beyond the crossover the near - side amplitude makes a negligible contribution to the cross section .",
    "the shoulder and the deep minimum seen at 9 mev / nucleon ( fig .",
    "fig : ws ) are washed out in the far - side amplitude and only a broad , less pronounced minimum survives , followed by a broad airy maximum and an exponential , structureless decay of the cross section at large angles . clearly , both the data at 9 and 19 mev / nucleon ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ws ] and fig : ws130 ) show far - side dominance as a possible manifestation of refractive effects .",
    "however , this simple dominance does not explain , by itself , the difference in the angular distributions seen at these energies , suggesting a difference in the reaction mechanism .",
    "in fact the above picture has been already challenged by anni @xcite and by michel _",
    "@xcite for the simple reason that the far - side amplitude has never been decomposed in subamplitudes which would explain the quoted interference .",
    "we come back to this topic in section [ sec6 ] . for the moment",
    "we adopt the interpretation of michel _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and denote the complex structure at intermediate angles in our data as pre - rainbow oscillations .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the ability of the folding model to describe the pre - rainbow oscillation seen at 9 mev / nucleon and the rainbow patterns at higher energies .",
    "data at somewhat lower energies are also examined in order to see if the plateau feature persists in adjacent systems and on a larger energy range .",
    "our preferred model is the nuclear matter approach of jeukenne , lejeune and mahaux ( jlm ) @xcite which incorporates a complex , energy and density dependent parametrization of the nn effective interaction obtained in a brueckner hartree - fock approximation from the reid soft core nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "the systematic study trache00 of the elastic scattering between @xmath5-shell nuclei at energies around 10 mev / nucleon led to the surprising result that on average , the imaginary part of the folded jlm potential was perfectly adequate to describe such reactions and did not need any renormalization ( @xmath66 ) , while the real component needed a strong renormalization , in line with other effective interactions used in folding models .",
    "however , the present data extend to a much larger angular range and need further refinements of this model .    in the jlm model the complex form factor for the optical potential is given by @xmath67where @xmath68 is the ( complex ) nn interaction , @xmath69 are the single particle densities of the interacting partners , calculated in a standard spherical hartree - fock procedure using the energy density functional of beiner and lombard with the surface term adjusted to reproduce the total binding energy @xcite , @xmath70 is the nn separation distance between interacting nucleons and @xmath71 is the overlap density .",
    "the effective nn interaction contains an isovector component which gives a negligibly small contribution for @xmath5-shell nuclei but is included here for convenience in conjunction with appropriate single particle isovector densities .",
    "the smearing function @xmath72 is taken as a normalized gaussian @xcite , @xmath73which tends to a @xmath74-function for @xmath75 , while for finite values of the range parameter @xmath76 it increases the @xmath55 radius of the folding form factor by @xmath77 , leaving unchanged the volume integral .",
    "inclusion of a smearing function with a varying range parameter , greatly increases the ability of the folding form factor to simulate the radial dependence of dpp .",
    "the geometric or arithmetic mean of the overlapping densities has been used to define the overlap density @xmath71 in eq .",
    "[ eqjlm1 ] @xmath78^{1/2 }   \\label{eqjlm3}\\]]and @xmath79 .",
    "\\label{eqjlm4}\\]]the former was introduced by campi and sprung in density - dependent hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "it is physically appealing since the overlap density tends to zero when one of the interacting nucleons is far from the bulk , and to the nuclear matter saturation value at complete overlap .",
    "the approximation in eq .",
    "[ eqjlm4 ] is similar to that used in folding calculations with density - dependent m3y effective interactions khoa , except for the factor @xmath80 which has been introduced here because jlm interaction is defined only up to the nuclear matter saturation value @xmath81 .",

    "6a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) may be due to the weak density dependence introduced by eq .",
    "[ eqjlm4 ] , and thus rainbow patterns could not be reproduced . however , the optical model analysis presented above showed clearly that the pre - rainbow oscillations ( at 9 mev / nucleon ) and rainbow patterns ( at 19 mev / nucleon ) could be described if and only if the potentials have the proper @xmath55 radius .",
    "it turns out that the smearing procedure described above is essential in simulating the complicated radial dependence of the dynamic polarization potential .    in the earlier analysis @xcite ,",
    "fixed values for the range parameters @xmath82 fm and @xmath83 fm , found from a global analysis of the data were used .",

    "the pre - rainbow oscillation is carried entirely by the dominant far - side component .",
    "some other high order structures appear at angles near 180@xmath26 as the result of near / far amplitude interference . at most forward angles this interference produces an inner fraunhofer crossing which give rise to a deep minimum in the cross section .    for @xmath2li+@xmath12be at 63 mev , jlm1 calculation failed to describe the oscillation near @xmath89 for the simple reason that data required a @xmath55 radius for the real potential @xmath90 fm , while the bare jlm interaction predicts a minimal @xmath54=3.6 fm for @xmath91 .",

    "a close examination of the parameters in table [ tab1:res_jlm1 ] reveals an erratic variation of the range parameters @xmath94 from one energy to another and from system to system . as mentioned above , this largely reflects the mass and energy dependence of dpp .",
    "the other parameters are more stable .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath84 decreases slowly from 5 to 16.5 mev / nucleon and then increases again up to 53 mev / nucleon , the highest energy at which reliable data exist .",
    "this may suggest that dpp reaches its maximum amplitude at energies around 16 mev / nucleon . on average the @xmath84 values in table [ tab1:res_jlm1 ]",
    "are somewhat larger than in our earlier analysis trache00 reflecting the need for stronger refractive effects , but again @xmath85 approaches unity , on average .",
    "as already mentioned , in one experimental run we have also measured the neutron transfer reaction @xmath1c(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath4c at e(@xmath2li)=63 mev .",
    "the purpose of the study was to determine the anc for the ground state of @xmath3li , and then , using charge symmetry to relate it with that in its mirror nucleus @xmath3b . the anc was then used to calculate the astrophysical factor @xmath95 that gives the rate of the proton capture reaction @xmath2be(@xmath96)@xmath3b , of crucial importance for the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the major advantage of the neutron transfer reaction over its mirror proton transfer reaction is that it involves a stable beam , and , therefore , a much more precise and detailed angular distribution could be measured . that allowed the determination of the admixture of the minor component @xmath97 in the wave function of the ground state of @xmath3li ( and @xmath3b , respectively ) , dominated by the @xmath98 orbital .",

    "eleven different combinations of entrance / exit potentials were used to show that the resulting values for @xmath99 and @xmath100 are very stable , when the potentials are reasonable .",
    "the potentials used were either volume woods - saxon forms with the parameters from similar projectile - target combinations at similar energies , or were obtained from the double folding procedure with the renormalization coefficients from the previous paper @xcite .",
    "calculations done after the publication with the new ( deeper ) potential `` 227 '' of table [ tab1:res_jlm1 ] in both entrance and exit channels lead to minor ( @xmath1015% ) variations in the results .",
    "the very good agreement between the experimental data and the dwba calculations and between the results of present and previous calculations ( figure [ fig : transf ] ) shows that the region of the potential contributing to transfer ( the surface ) is well and uniquely described .",
    "this simultaneous description of elastic and transfer data is also an argument for the complete determination of the optical potentials .",
    "the dispersion relation is a fundamental property of the optical potential ( see for example @xcite ) and a selection between ambiguous potentials can be performed by studying the dispersive properties of these potentials , provided accurate analyses of experimental data are available over a large energy range .    the threshold anomaly which manifests itself as a sharp increase of the real optical potential for energies close to the coulomb barrier , has been explained by nagarajan , mahaux and satchler @xcite as due to the opening of reaction channels with increasing energy .",
    "an application of the dispersion relation for elastic scattering of @xmath11o on @xmath102pb at energies around 80 mev accounted well for this effect .",
    "later it was conjectured by mahaux , ngo and satchler @xcite that for loosely bound nuclei , this anomaly may be absent .",
    "for these nuclei , the strong coupling with breakup channels gives rise to a repulsive dpp which compensates the strong attractive component . according to sakuragi @xcite this effect",

    "@xcite of @xmath10li+@xmath103si at near barrier energies found that the strength of the real part of the folding potential using the m3y interaction remains almost independent of energy , suggesting a cancellation between the attractive ( dispersive ) component and the strong repulsive dynamic polarization potential arising from the coupling to continuum states .",
    "another study of  @xmath0li+@xmath102pb near the coulomb barrier @xcite found that at low energies the dpp is of opposite sign for the two projectiles and there is a threshold anomaly for @xmath2li but none for @xmath10li .",
    "no significant fusion hindrance caused by breakup effects was found in the fusion reaction of @xmath0li on a @xmath104co target near the coulomb barrier @xcite , thus leading the authors to conclude that breakup suppression above the barrier appears to be a common feature of @xmath0li induced reactions .    therefore , the energy dependence of the @xmath0li optical potential is far from clear and the competition between dispersive ( attractive ) and coupling to continuum ( repulsive ) effects need to be studied more carefully .",
    "an earlier study @xcite showed that the total reaction cross section for @xmath10li scattering saturates at energies around 20 mev / nucleon and therefore dispersive effects could be identified by accumulating good optical potentials in this energy range .",

    "in fact , this logarithmic dependence is physically meaningful and can be understood on the basis of the dispersion relation with a schematic ( line segments ) approach for the imaginary volume integral .",
    "a relatively strong localized energy variation is predicted by the linear model in the range 0 - 20 mev / nucleon , while the exponential model predicts a smooth dependence on the entire range of energies .",

    "most probably the phenomenological values found at 5 mev / nucleon are due to the erratic variation in the ws parameters due to the rapidly changing elastic scattering angular distributions @xcite near the resonance energy region around 20 mev .",
    "once we have established the main features of the average om potential , we turn now to study the reaction mechanism in the elastic scattering of @xmath0li on light targets at 9 mev / nucleon using semiclassical methods .",
    "the far - side dominance observed in the angular distributions at 9 and 19 mev / nucleon is not able to explain the differences in the reaction mechanism at these energies .",
    "the reason is of course that the far / near ( f / n ) decomposition method does not perform a dynamic decomposition of the scattering function , but merely decomposes the scattering amplitude into traveling waves .",
    "the intermediate angle structures , such as those observed in our angular distributions , have been repeatedly interpreted as arising from the interference of two ranges in angular momenta @xmath121 and @xmath122 contributing to the same negative deflection angle .",

    "the major interest in this theory comes from the fact that it can give precious information on the response of a nuclear system to the nuclear interior .",
    "recent application @xcite of this technique helped to clarify the controversial problem of `` airy oscillation '' seen in low energy @xmath11o+@xmath4c scattering @xcite .",
    "for the potentials in table [ tab1:res_ws ] ( the first entry for each of the four cases measured here ) we discard the absorptive terms and define the effective potential as , @xmath126where the langer prescription has been used for the centrifugal term .",
    "this guarantees the correct behavior of the semiclassical wave function at the origin @xcite .",
    "then we calculate the deflection function , @xmath127where @xmath128 is the outer zero of the square root , i.e. the radius of closest approach to the scatterer and @xmath17 is the reduced mass . note that with the replacement @xmath129 , eq .",

    "rather we need an interpretation appropriate for orbiting , a well documented situation in classical physics @xcite .",
    "we identify the cusp angular momenta as orbiting momenta ( @xmath134 ) since they are related with the coalescence of two ( barrier ) turning points and the innermost turning point given by the centrifugal barrier become classically accessible .",

    "the internal component gets significant values up to the grazing angular momentum ( @xmath162=15 ) and is negligibly small beyond this value .",
    "the barrier component resembles a strong absorption profile and this justifies the interpretation that it corresponds to that part of the flux not penetrating into the nuclear interior . for values near the orbiting angular momentum ( @xmath16312 ) ,",
    "the two components interfere and a downward spike appears in the total profile , in complete agreement with the quantum result .",
    "second , the b / i components are almost decoupled in the angular momentum space and therefore they will contribute in different angular ranges .",
    "semiclassical cross sections are compared with the data in fig.fig:wkbcross for the reaction @xmath10li+@xmath4c at 54 mev .",
    "better insight into this technique is obtained by further decomposing the b / i components into far and near ( bf / bn and if / in ) subcomponents .",
    "clearly , the barrier component dominates the forward angle region .",
    "fraunhofer diffractive oscillations appear as the result of bf and bn interference . at large angles ,",
    "the internal contribution accounts for the full cross section . as both b / i contributions are dominated by the far - side component ( fig .",
    "fig : wkbcross bottom panels ) , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : wkbmin ] the angles at which the phase difference of the bf and if amplitudes passes through an odd multiple of @xmath164 , i.e. where minima should be expected .",
    "since the crossing angle ( where @xmath165 ) is about @xmath166 75@xmath26 and lies just in between predicted minima , the coherent interference around this angle gives rise to the `` plateau '' ( constructive ) and the deep minimum ( destructive ) at @xmath167 80@xmath26 .",
    "similar consideration apply to the other three reactions .",
    "thus , the intermediate angle exotic structure in angular distributions for the elastic scattering of @xmath0li on light targets can be understood as a result of coherent interference of two far - side subamplitudes generated by different terms in the uniform multireflection expansion of the scattering function ( terms @xmath154=0 and @xmath154=1 in eq .",

    "our intention is to narrow the ambiguities in the optical model potentials by systematic studies of the scattering of loosely bound projectiles over a large range of angles and energies , and extract information that can be used for systems involving radioactive projectiles , for which elastic scattering data of very good quality are not easily available .",
    "we demonstrate this procedure by reanalyzing the one neutron transfer reaction @xmath1c(@xmath2li,@xmath3li)@xmath4c using optical potentials obtained in the present study .    the present data , which extend over a much larger angular range than previously measured , confirm the existence of an exotic intermediate angle structure , observed previously by trcka _",

    "@xcite as a diffractive effect arising from an angular momentum dependent absorption .",
    "we adopt an opposite point of view and interpret these structures as refractive effects arising from a fine balance between the real and imaginary components of the optical potential .",
    "we have performed a traditional analysis of our data in terms of woods - saxon and microscopic jlm folded potentials .",
    "both approaches lead to the conclusion that the optical potential is deep and surprisingly transparent , in line with findings for more bound systems . folding model form factors",
    "have been renormalized in the usual way in order to account for the energy and radial dependence of the dynamic polarization potential .",
    "it is suggested that dpp attains its maximum amplitude at approximately 16 mev / nucleon for these systems .",
    "the intermediate angle structures could be reproduced only with potentials exceeding a critical volume integral of about 300 mev @xmath46 and , consequently , are severely selective , limiting the ambiguities in the determination of the omp .",
    "the remaining discrete ambiguities could be removed by a dispersion relation analysis .",
    "based on a good estimation of the absorption at low energy ( 5 - 20 mev / nucleon ) , this analysis allowed us to extract a smooth energy dependence of the optical potential .",
    "our analysis did not find any spectacular anomaly near the coulomb barrier and seems to confirm , to some extent , the conjecture of a canceling effect between the repulsive dynamic polarization potential due to the coupling with breakup channels and the attractive , dispersive component of the optical potential .    in our previous study @xcite we found a simple recipe to obtain omp for loosely bound @xmath5-shell nuclei from a double folding procedure using the jlm effective nn interaction .",
    "the already independent real and imaginary parts were smeared with constant , but different ranges @xmath82 fm and @xmath83 fm , which accounted for the well known need for a wider imaginary potential to describe the experimental data .",
    "we found that a considerable renormalization of the real part was needed @xmath168 ( leading to volume integrals @xmath169 mev @xmath46 ) , but not for the imaginary part @xmath170 .",
    "that recipe was already successfully applied to predict the elastic scattering angular distributions of rnbs on light targets in a number of cases at energies around 10 mev / nucleon .",
    "the present analysis shows that in order to reproduce the structures observed at intermediate angles in the same cases measured , one needs to  allow for a more complicated radial dependence of the dynamic polarization potential , energy and target dependent , and require deep real potentials with volume integrals larger than a critical value of @xmath93 mev @xmath46 .",
    "this is a conclusion of the phenomenological analyses and is supported by the dispersion relation analysis .",
    "however , the elastic scattering data in the angular range of the fraunhofer oscillations and the transfer reactions can be equally well described by the previous potentials produced by the folding procedure with fixed smearing ranges for the effective nn interaction and the simple renormalization of ref .",
