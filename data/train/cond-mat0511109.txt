    "although forty years have passed since the discovery of the kondo effect , it is still one of the most interesting topics in condensed matter physics ; it lies at the heart of understanding strongly correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect , which leads to the quenching of an impurity spin , forms the basis of the physics of a single magnetic impurity embedded in a metal .",
    "however , systems with more than one impurity are considerably more complicated and present additional difficulties in a theoretical investigation . in particular , there are two effects which compete against each other in multiple - impurity systems : the kondo effect and the runderman  kittel  kasuya",
    " yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "the rkky exchange favors the formation of non - local magnetic correlations ; the kondo effect , on the other hand , is based on purely local magnetic correlations .",
    "the competition between kondo effect and rkky interaction is thought to be the key mechanism to understanding the magnetic properties of the heavy fermion materials  @xcite .",
    "the simplest systems in which to study this competition are two - impurity models . recently ,",
    "such models have also attracted much attention in the context of double quantum dots  @xcite , which can be viewed as a direct experimental realization of the two - impurity kondo model .    theoretically , the two - impurity anderson model ( tiam )  @xcite and the two - impurity kondo model ( tikm )  @xcite have been extensively studied with various methods ; nevertheless , their physical properties at low temperature are not yet well understood .",
    "in particular , the situation is far from clear concerning dynamical properties because only a few methods are able to reliably calculate the dynamical properties of such models due to their complexity .",
    "so far , the spectral density has been calculated using perturbation theory ( pt )  @xcite and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite , but the results are not fully satisfactory .",
    "the pt provides an explicatory and accurate picture of quantum impurity dynamics only in certain limiting cases . while the nrg can determine the low - energy dynamics of quantum impurity models almost exactly , it is less precise at high energy .",
    "recently , the dynamical density - matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) method  @xcite was applied to the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) and it was shown that the method can calculate the impurity spectral density with good resolution for all frequencies and coupling strengths  @xcite .",
    "this method can be extended to investigate the dynamics of a two - impurity problem without difficulty .",
    "here we study the spectral density of the tiam using the ddmrg method .",
    "since the parameter space of the tiam is rather large , for simplicity we focus here on the limit of small inter - impurity distance .",
    "this simplification does not change the substance of the problem and is quite likely relevant for typical experimental situations , e.g. , clusters of magnetic atoms on metal surfaces or multiple quantum - dot systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the efficiency of the ddmrg for the two - impurity system and to discuss the dynamical properties of the tiam in the limit of zero impurity distance as the first step of a more general ddmrg study .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model hamiltonian for the tiam is introduced . in section 3",
    ", we transform the hamiltonian for an efficient treatment with the ( d)dmrg and define even- and odd - parity orbitals of coupled impurities . in section 4",
    ", we show the static and the dynamical properties calculated with the ( d)dmrg method .",
    "the conclusion and discussion follow in section 5 .",
    "the hamiltonian for two impurities placed at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath5 in a local level ( the impurity site @xmath6 ) , @xmath7and @xmath8 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath9 in an eigenstate of the ( noninteracting ) host band with dispersion @xmath10 .",
    "the sum over @xmath11 runs over all states of the host band .",
    "the hybridization between the local impurity state and the delocalized band state @xmath11 is given by the positive couplings @xmath12 .",
    "electrons in the local level are subject to a coulomb repulsion @xmath13 . in this paper ,",
    "the energy level of impurity sites is set by @xmath14 . under this assumption",
    ", we can map our model to the two - impurity kondo model in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we also set @xmath15 and replace @xmath16 for simplicity .",
    "thus , our model depends on the parameter @xmath13 and the hybridization function @xmath17 for a symmetric hybridization function , @xmath18 , the tiam is particle - hole symmetric for @xmath19 .    since , for the time being , we are interested in understanding the qualitative aspects of the model , it is convenient to choose a flat - band host density as the hybridization function .",
    "in addition , the flat - band case of the siam is very well understood  @xcite and is thus helpful to explain features found in our model .",
    "we also take the host bandwidth to be much larger than any other bare energy scale and use a hybridization function which is constant , @xmath20 .",
    "our goal is then to compute the spectral density in the relevant energy window @xmath21 with @xmath22 . for all numerical results presented here",
    ", the energy scale is set by @xmath23 .",
    "in this work , we employ the dmrg technique  @xcite which is a reliable numerical method for one - dimensional systems .",
    "we use the standard dmrg method to calculate ground - state properties and the ddmrg method  @xcite to calculate dynamical properties . in order to carry out our calculations",
    ", we consider @xmath24 electrons in a system consisting of @xmath25 noninteracting bath sites ( @xmath25 even ) and two impurity sites .",
    "the electron density is @xmath26 .",
    "the ( d)dmrg calculations can be performed on finite lattices only , i.e. , we must discretize the host band and carry out ( d)dmrg calculations for finite number @xmath25 of host band eigenstates corresponding to energies @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and then extrapolate the results to a continuous host band ( @xmath29 ) if needed . choosing a discretization of the host band , i.e. , selecting the @xmath25 band state energies @xmath27 , should be done appropriately depending on what is to be obtained .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is , however , somewhat unsuited for a dmrg treatment because it includes hopping terms that are long - range .",
    "for example , the system size is limited to @xmath30 for typical calculations even when several thousand density - matrix eigenstates are kept in the dmrg procedure , the maximum possible on current workstations .",
    "therefore , we first transform the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) into a linear chain with nearest - neighbor hopping only , @xmath31 the new fermion operators @xmath32 correspond to electronic states in the host band and are related to the original representation by a canonical transformation @xmath33 the orthogonal matrix @xmath34 , the diagonal terms @xmath35 , and the nearest - neighbor hopping terms @xmath36 are calculated using the lanczos algorithm for tridiagonalizing a symmetric matrix starting from the initial vector @xmath37 with @xmath38 . for a hybridization function ( [ hybridization ] ) symmetric about @xmath39 , the diagonal terms @xmath35 vanish .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) describes two impurities coupled to one end of a one - dimensional chain representing the host band states ( see figure  [ fig_model ] ) .",
    "this transformation enables us to handle a system with up to @xmath40 bath states using the ( d)dmrg method .",
    "furthermore , for efficient treatment , we introduce even- ( @xmath41 ) and odd- ( @xmath42 ) parity impurity orbitals @xmath43 as in ref.19 . with @xmath15 , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is transformed to @xmath44   \\label{ham3_u } \\",

    "note that only the even - parity orbital hybridizes with the noninteracting bath states directly . when @xmath46 , the even- and odd - parity orbitals are completely separate .",
    "in our model , they will be mixed only via the coulomb interaction .",
    "we begin our discussion with some static properties of the system , namely , the electron density at the impurities and the spin - spin correlation function between the impurities , calculated with the standard dmrg method . here",
    "we apply a logarithmic discretization scheme of the host band , @xmath47 ( with @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , as usually used in wilson s renormalization group method  @xcite , because we are interested in the case of large host bandwidth as well as in having dense bath states around the chemical potential for quantitative accuracy .",
    "typically , we use @xmath50 bath states with @xmath51 and @xmath52 and keep @xmath53 density - matrix eigenstates in the dmrg procedure . in some cases , systems with up to @xmath54 and @xmath55 are used to extrapolate the results to @xmath56 .",
    "the average electron densities @xmath57 and @xmath58 for even- and odd - parity orbitals of coupled impurities , respectively , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) for different values of @xmath13 as function of @xmath59 .",
    "since the two - impurity sites are equivalent , we have @xmath60 . note that @xmath61 can take values between 0 and 2 due to the charge degrees of freedom at the impurity sites , in contrast to the two - impurity kondo model for which @xmath62 always .    when @xmath19 , @xmath63 for all interaction strengths due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the local densities are drastically affected by @xmath59 .",
    "we find a discontinuous transition at a critical value @xmath64 which is dependent on @xmath13 .",
    "the critical value @xmath65 is zero at @xmath46 and becomes larger with increasing @xmath13 . in the large @xmath13 limit ,",
    "it saturates at @xmath66 .",

    "an infinitesimally small @xmath59 shifts the state above @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 . for small but finite @xmath13",
    ", the situation is similar and the transition is caused by the competition between @xmath59 and @xmath13 . at @xmath19 , the odd - parity orbital is split by the coulomb interaction [ see eq.([ham3_u ] ) ] into two states with energy difference @xmath72 , the lower and the upper hubbard band ( we call them the lhb and the uhb , respectively ) located at @xmath73",
    ". a finite @xmath59 has the effect of shifting the lhb to higher energies by @xmath74 .",
    "the odd - parity orbital is occupied by one electron if the lhb is below @xmath75 and almost vacant if the lhb is above @xmath75 .",
    "this leads to @xmath76 and a large discontinuity ( @xmath77 ) of @xmath58 at @xmath65 .",
    "this anticipated behavior is in fact observed in our dmrg results . as @xmath13 increases , the odd - parity orbital begins to hybridize indirectly with the host band via the interaction term ( [ ham3_u ] ) .",
    "the discontinuity , therefore , becomes smaller and goes to zero as @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath65 has almost no @xmath13-dependence in the large-@xmath13 regime .",
    "this implies that the physics behind the transition for large @xmath13 is different from the competition between @xmath59 and @xmath13 at small @xmath13 . before we discuss a possible mechanism in the next paragraph ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the behavior of the even - parity orbital .",
    "for all @xmath13 values , @xmath57 increases slowly as a function of @xmath59 because the even - parity orbital hybridizes directly with the host band , thus experiencing a strong broadening .",
    "hence , the discontinuity of @xmath57 at @xmath64 is smaller than that of @xmath58 .",
    "we can also see the largest discontinuity , which means that the charge fluctuation on the even - parity orbital is largest , for intermediate @xmath13 values ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath80 independent of @xmath13 below @xmath65 , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 for finite @xmath13 .",
    "we now investigate the spin - spin correlation between the two impurities , @xmath84 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) as a function of @xmath59 for different values of @xmath13 .",
    "before we discuss the results , let us first identify the different types of magnetic interactions present in our model .",
    "first , we have the @xmath85-@xmath86 exchange interaction @xmath87 , which is the antiferromagnetic interaction between an electron on the impurity sites and conduction electrons . for a single impurity",
    ", @xmath87 leads to the kondo effect and a _ local _ spin singlet as the ground state . within the standard schrieffer - wolff mapping ,",
    "the value for @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the effective coulomb interaction and the impurities are both occupied by one electron .",
    "the @xmath85-@xmath86 exchange is effective only when an electron is localized on the impurity so that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "second , the conduction electrons mediate the rkky interaction @xmath92 . for our particular setup",
    ", we obtain a ferromagnetic interaction between two electrons on the impurity sites . as usual",
    ", @xmath92 is obtained as second - order process , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "third , the model exhibits a direct exchange interaction @xmath94 due to the coupling @xmath59 , which is an antiferromagnetic interaction and is given by the standard expression @xmath95 .",
    "we expect that for @xmath96 ferromagnetic correlations due to the rkky interaction are dominant , i.e. , @xmath97 . on the other hand , when @xmath98 , antiferromagnetic correlations due to the exchange interaction are stronger , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "such a transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic correlations at @xmath65 is in fact found at all interaction strengths , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath84 increases with increasing @xmath13 and reaches the maximum possible value as @xmath78 , which means that one electron is localized on each impurity in the @xmath100 limit .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath13-dependence of the critical value @xmath65 .",
    "the transition is driven by the charge degrees of freedom in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "however , the spin degrees of freedom play an essential role in the strong - coupling regime . taking into account that the spin - spin correlations between the impurity sites change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic at @xmath65 , we may expect that the competition between the rkky and direct exchange interactions is the origin of the transition .",
    "if we take @xmath101 as the criterion for the occurrence of the transition , we obtain @xmath102 .",
    "thus , @xmath65 would go to zero as @xmath78 , which is obviously inconsistent with the dmrg results which show almost constant @xmath65 as a function of @xmath13 .    up to now",
    ", we have not taken into account @xmath87 , which leads to a competition between the formation of local kondo and non - local singlets , offering a quite different mechanism for the transition . in this case , the criterion to obtain @xmath65 is @xmath103 , which gives @xmath104 .",
    "this result is indeed consistent with our findings .",
    "thus , the transition in the strong coupling regime can be interpreted as competition between local singlet formation due to the kondo effect and non - local singlet formation due to the direct exchange introduced by @xmath59 .",
    "note , however , that , in contrast to the general folklore , the boundary is _ not _ set by @xmath105 , but by the direct comparison of the bare energy scales .",
    "we also find that the total spin is @xmath106 for @xmath96 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "in this section , we study the spectral density for impurities in the tiam .",
    "the impurity one - particle green function for even- and odd - parity orbitals can be written as @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , where @xmath111 is the ground - state energy and @xmath112 represents a ground - state expectation value .",

    "the spectral density fulfills the sum rule @xmath116 note that the spectral densities for both impurities are the same , i.e. , @xmath117 , and are equal to @xmath118/2 $ ] .",
    "the standard dmrg algorithm  @xcite can be used to calculate the ground - state properties as shown in the last section .",
    "in particular , the ground - state wave function @xmath119 and the ground - state energy @xmath111 can readily be obtained .",
    "to compute dynamic properties such as the impurity green s function  ( [ green ] ) we use the ddmrg  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on a variational principle .",
    "one can easily show that for @xmath120 and fixed frequency @xmath121 , the minimum of the functional @xmath122 with respect to all quantum states @xmath123 is @xmath124 the functional minimum is related to the convolution of the spectral density  ( [ bdos ] ) with a lorentz distribution of width @xmath125 by @xmath126 a similar result is obtained for the spectral density  ( [ ados ] ) if one substitutes @xmath127 for @xmath128 , @xmath129 for @xmath121 and @xmath130 for @xmath131 in the above equations .",
    "the ddmrg method consists essentially of minimizing the functional  ( [ functional ] ) numerically using the standard dmrg algorithm .",
    "thus the ddmrg provides the spectral densities @xmath132 and @xmath133 for a finite broadening @xmath125 .",
    "the full spectral density  ( [ dos ] ) convolved with the lorentz distribution @xmath134 } \\label{convolution}\\ ] ] is given by the sum of @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the real part of the green s function can be calculated with no additional computational cost but is generally less accurate .",
    "the necessary broadening of spectral functions in ddmrg calculations is actually very useful for studying continuous spectra or for doing a finite - size scaling analysis  @xcite .",
    "what we really would like to obtain is the spectral density in the @xmath135 limit .",
    "this can be done by carrying out a deconvolution of the ddmrg data  @xcite . in theory ,",
    "a deconvolution amounts to solving ( [ convolution ] ) for @xmath136 using the ddmrg data on the left - hand side .",
    "we also know that the broadened spectral density of the impurity system on an infinite lattice ( @xmath29 ) is usually almost identical to the spectral density of the discretized impurity system ( @xmath137 ) if @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , one can make the approximation that the ddmrg data for @xmath139 describes the broadened spectral density for @xmath29 and can then solve ( [ convolution ] ) approximately under the condition that @xmath136 is the exact spectral density of the tiam .",
    "for instance , one can require that @xmath136 is a continuous and relatively smooth function . to obtain quantitatively accurate spectra after deconvolution",

    "we next turn to the spectrum for the odd - parity orbital , @xmath156 .",
    "as long as @xmath46 , this orbital has no direct hybridization with the host band , so that @xmath156 consists of a localized state , i.e. , a single @xmath147-function peak .",
    "when a small @xmath173 is introduced at @xmath19 , this peak splits into two peaks located around @xmath174 due to the effective repulsion on the odd - parity orbital @xmath90 [ see eq.([ham3_u ] ) ] .",
    "they correspond to the lhb and the uhb .",
    "in other words , the odd - parity orbital is half - filled and a mott - hubbard gap opens .",
    "the peaks are still very sharp but are no longer exact @xmath147-functions , as we can see in fig .",

    "the lhb and uhb become sharper ( broader ) while retaining their respective weights .",

    "for the tiam , however , the situation is more complex due to competing interactions , i.e. , the rkky interaction , the kondo ( or @xmath85-@xmath86 exchange ) effect , and the exchange interaction between impurity sites . in fig .",

    "as long as @xmath59 is smaller than @xmath65 , the quasi - particle peak stays pinned at @xmath39 and maintains its height ( @xmath192 ) , while the hubbard satellites stay located at @xmath193 with width @xmath194 .",
    "above @xmath65 , on the other hand , the kondo peak vanishes .",
    "the local spin is now screened due to the formation of a non - local singlet between the impurities due to the dominant exchange interaction , i.e. , the scattering channels leading to the abrikosov - suhl resonance are not active any more .",
    "simultaneously , the ` effective ' hybridization between the host band and the even - parity orbital becomes weaker so that the width of hubbard satellites becomes narrower .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the hubbard satellites turn into lorenzians with width @xmath150 and weight @xmath195 located at @xmath196 in the limit of @xmath83 and @xmath78 .",
    "next , let us turn to the odd - parity spectral density @xmath156 . at @xmath19 ,",
    "we find four peaks .",
    "the two prominent peaks located at @xmath197 can be identified with the hubbard bands of the electrons localized in this orbital . since no direct hybridization to the band states exists , these peaks are sharper than the corresponding ones in @xmath141 , i.e.",
    ", the broadening is introduced indirectly via the coulomb interaction .",
    "rather more interesting is the appearance of a structure at the fermi energy consisting of two narrow peaks separated by a gap @xmath198 for @xmath19 . as @xmath59 increases , this feature and , in particular , the gap prevails , although its size decreases ( see insets to fig .  [ fig_u15 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the gap edges remain symmetric with respect to the fermi energy , while the spectral weight is larger below the fermi level as long as @xmath199 . for @xmath200 , a rearrangement of spectral weight from below to above",
    "the fermi energy takes place , while the size of the gap does not change noticeably .",
    "we interpret this structure as a replica of the kondo resonance induced indirectly by the interactions between the even and odd channel .",
    "however , adding or removing electrons in the odd - parity orbital would at least break one `` kondo bond '' in the even - parity channel , i.e. , cost an energy @xmath201 , explaining the appearance and size of the gap for @xmath19 . note that , in contrast to the weak - coupling regime , this explanation connects the gap to the spin rather than to the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "as @xmath59 increases , the gap becomes smaller because the direct exchange interaction @xmath94 between the impurity sites competes with the kondo effect , effectively reducing the local moment , which is screened by the band states , and hence the corresponding spin gap .",
    "however , we find @xmath202 , which would be the naive expectation , because the formation of dynamic spin correlations between the impurities due to @xmath94 introduces a further contribution to @xmath203 .",
    "thus , the gap will be always finite and develops a minimum close to @xmath65 , where @xmath103 . for @xmath200 ,",
    "the impurities form a non - local spin singlet and the spin gap will scale with @xmath94 , i.e. , increase again slowly with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "an estimate for @xmath204 yields @xmath205 , which is in rough agreement with the numerical value @xmath206 obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig_u15](c ) .       and for the even - parity orbital @xmath141 with ( a ) @xmath19 , ( b ) @xmath207 , and ( c ) @xmath177 at @xmath208 and @xmath140 .",
    "dashed lines denote @xmath141 calculated with a constant discretization for @xmath54 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , then deconvolved .",
    "solid lines denote @xmath156 calculated with a variable discretization for @xmath157 , @xmath209 and a constant broadening @xmath161 , then deconvolved .",
    "insets : expanded view around the fermi level @xmath39.,width=283 ]    finally , we present the spectral function for @xmath210 , i.e. , in the intermediate - coupling regime . note that from the point of view of the siam this value already resides within the `` strong - coupling '' regime delimited by @xmath211 ( the effective hybridization for the even - parity channel is @xmath150 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_u5 ] , we show the spectral density calculated with the ddmrg for @xmath19 , @xmath212 , and @xmath187 at @xmath208 . the transition here occurs at @xmath213 .",
    "as already mentioned above , the even - parity spectral density @xmath141 below @xmath65 resembles that of the siam .",
    "the central peak at @xmath39 starts to become narrower and its spectral weight is increasingly transferred to the high - energy range with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "however , the three - peak structure typical of the strong - coupling regime is not yet fully developed ; the hubbard bands appear only as visible but shallow shoulders around @xmath214 .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the siam , the central peak here does not fully reach the friedel limit , its height being slightly lower than @xmath215 .",
    "this behavior was also seen in previous nrg studies  @xcite and in the mean - field approach  @xcite , and is connected to the non - local magnetic correlations induced by the rkky exchange , which is stronger for smaller @xmath13 . as in the strong - coupling regime , @xmath141 hardly changes with increasing @xmath59 until @xmath65 is reached , where a dramatic redistribution of spectral weight connected to the formation of a non - local singlet due to the direct exchange introduced by @xmath59 appears . in particular , as in the strong - coupling regime , the kondo peak has vanished completely .",
    "the behavior of the odd - parity channel in fig .  [ fig_u5 ] is also similar to the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we again find a gap in the spectrum , which remains symmetric about @xmath39 for all @xmath59 , and observe a similar but much more pronounced change in the distribution of spectral weight , as in fig .",
    "[ fig_u15 ] .",
    "the gap , too , initially decreases until @xmath65 is reached and then increases again .",
    "we believe that the physics behind this behavior is essentially the same as in the @xmath100 limit , although the energy scales associated with the spin gaps induced by the different exchange mechanism in particular now can not be written down explicitly",
    ". however , we expect them to be larger than in the limit of large @xmath13 , which is indeed what we observe in fig .  [ fig_u5 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have presented static and dynamical properties of the two - impurity anderson model at half filling for vanishing impurity separation . in this limit ,",
    "the otherwise rather complex model becomes considerably simpler , nevertheless retaining most of its interesting physical aspects .",
    "in particular , the competition between different types of magnetic correlations such as kondo , rkky and superexchange is preserved .",
    "we employ the ( dynamical ) density - matrix renormalization method to calculate static properties ( filling , magnetic correlations ) and one - particle spectra . for the latter ,",
    "we obtain results that are convoluted with a lorenzian , which we , however , can deconvolute with good accuracy , as demonstrated for the exactly solvable case @xmath46 .    while this model can ,",
    "in fact , easily be studied by e.g. , wilson s nrg , an evident advantage of the ddmrg is that one obtains an accurate description of spectral features on all energy scales at the cost of the resolution of exponentially small structures . in the nrg ,",
    "on the other hand , exponentially small scales can be readily resolved , however , at the expense of accuracy at intermediate and high energies .",
    "since we are interested here in describing both the features emerging at intermediate ( @xmath216 , @xmath94 ) and high energy scales ( hubbard bands @xmath72 ) as well as at a possible small kondo scale , we feel that the ddmrg is more useful for the present study .    in the weak - coupling regime , @xmath217 , we observe a transition between a situation with weakly ferromagnetically coupled impurity spins to a situation with weak antiferromagnetic correlations as function of inter - impurity hopping @xmath59 , as is apparent from the behavior of @xmath218 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . from the spectral functions discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig_u1 ] , we can furthermore infer that this transition is primarily driven by the charge degrees of freedom in the odd - parity channel of the two - impurity system . for @xmath219 , on the other hand , the transition is into a state with rather strong antiferromagnetic correlations . at the same time , the behavior of the spectral functions , in particular in the odd - parity channel , changes considerably .",
    "although the transition is still accompanied by a change in occupancy in the odd - parity channel , this change is visibly reduced .",
    "furthermore , the gap in the odd - parity spectrum is always pinned to the fermi energy and is of the size of the typical magnetic exchange interactions , which points to the spin degrees of freedom as the driving force of the transition .",
    "finally , the existence of a kondo peak in the even - parity spectrum for @xmath199 , which abruptly vanishes for @xmath200 , must be taken as evidence that the transition is in fact driven by the competition between kondo and direct exchange in this regime .",
    "it is quite important to note that the actual transition occurs at the point where @xmath103 and _ not _ when @xmath105 , and also that the energy scales appearing in the spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig_u15 ] and [ fig_u5 ] are in fact related to these `` intermediate '' quantities rather than the actually much smaller kondo scale .",
    "of course , the current investigation is restricted to a special limit of the tiam , namely , that of vanishing impurity separation .",
    "the results for this case clearly show that a more thorough investigation of this model is still necessary .",
    "in particular , we believe that such an investigation must carefully study the relation between the different energy scales inherent to the problem . the method to study the tiam should be chosen so that it can at least resolve accurately intermediate , i.e. , of the order of the effective exchange interactions , and low energy scales , i.e. , of the order of the kondo scale .",
    "evidently , we can not expect that any method can handle both regimes equally well when the energy scale of the latter is exponentially small , but we believe that the ddmrg can at least treat the intermediate situation when @xmath220 but is still resolvable with the method .",
