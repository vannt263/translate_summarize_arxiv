    "this paper develops new modelling and estimation procedures for complex - valued time series .",
    "we derive the interpretation of such models , and efficient methods for their estimation based on sampled time series .",
    "complex - valued series are a useful representation of bivariate series , and arise in a significant number of important application areas , such as functional magnetic resonance imaging  @xcite , doppler ultrasound signals of bloodflow  @xcite , optical tomography  @xcite , seismic readings  @xcite , neural networks  @xcite , meteorology and oceanography  @xcite and blind source separation  @xcite .",
    "we refer to section 1.9 in  @xcite for a more extensive list .",
    "there have also been a number of recent advances in methodological statistics for the analysis of complex - valued vectors , as well as for time - series samples  @xcite . a common need in applications",
    "is the ability to specify a simple parametric model for the signal structure , and then to estimate these parameters from a finite sample .",
    "however , approaches to inference for complex - valued series have mainly been non - parametric , and little focus has been placed on methods for efficient parametric inference . for reasons that will be come clear , our approach to parametric modelling will be in the frequency - domain . to this end , a main contribution of this paper is extending the whittle likelihood @xcite to complex - valued time series , addressing new ways to deal with finite sample effects in the process .",

    "the gdp is a database of global circulation measurements important for our understanding of decadal to century - scale climate change .",
    "each series in this data set can be represented as a complex - valued series .",
    "for example , we show a 150-day trajectory from global drifter program i d # 44000 in the top right of figure  [ figintro ] .",
    "the velocities corresponding to the eastward and northward displacements , together with the periodogram ( the magnitude square of the fourier transform ) of the complex - valued velocity for the first 40 days of these two velocity signals , are displayed on the bottom row of figure  [ figintro ] .",
    "we have plotted the negative and positive frequency axes overlaid , and it is clear that certain features are only present on one side of the spectrum , indicating oscillatory behaviour with a preferred direction of spin .",
    "such structure is significantly easier to model in the frequency domain than in the time domain .",
    "the first key contribution of this paper is the creation of appropriate frequency - domain models for complex - valued time series like the surface drifter velocity records .",
    "the second key contribution is the development of an improved inference method .",
    "specifically , we practically and efficiently adapt whittle likelihood for real and complex - valued time series . for asymptotic understanding",
    ", well - established results have been the consequence of the initially derived theory , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for finite @xmath0 however , more subtle effects are known to be in evidence  @xcite .",
    "most observed time series are nonstationary ( as in figure  [ figintro ] ) , such that stationarity can only be reasonably assumed over small windows , for example by assuming local stationarity or segmenting the series .",
    "this motivates the development of parsimonious models , and indicates the need for bias - corrected estimation procedures for finite - length samples .    to achieve accurate inference with small sample sizes , we here propose the use of the _ blurred _ whittle likelihood .",
    "this novel approach accounts for sampling effects such as leakage and aliasing , while maintaining the @xmath1 computational efficiency of the standard whittle likelihood .",
    "we prove consistency and discuss properties of our likelihood , and analyse performance through simulations against state - of - the - art time domain approximations @xcite .",
    "while our focus is on complex - valued series , the advantages of the blurred whittle likelihood are just as relevant for applications to real - valued series .",
    "in addition , we extend a number of related statistical procedures to complex - valued time series . we propose semi - parametric procedures for models that are misspecified at certain frequencies , relating this to @xcite .",
    "we construct a parametric test for impropriety , which tests for anisotropy if the time series track spatial positions .",
    "finally , we provide model choice criteria for selecting between nested models .    at first glance",
    ", it may seem that formulating theory and methods for complex - valued time series is just a special case of the study of bivariate real - valued series . in this paper",
    "we will show that this is not the case .",
    "we introduce flexible models for complex - valued signal structure that incorporate the possibility of anisotropy or impropriety .",
    "a focus here is on the matrn process , a natural choice for modelling multiscale variability such as that seen in the surface drifter trajectories .",
    "we shall illustrate such concepts with practical examples .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "s : prelim ] we provide some necessary preliminaries for real- and complex - valued time series . in section  [ s : models ]",
    "we introduce our models for cartesian and rotary structure in complex - valued time series .",
    "section  [ s : whittle ] introduces the whittle likelihood for complex - valued time series and also the _ blurred _ likelihood which correctly accounts for finite - sample bias in both real- and complex - valued time series .",
    "we then prove consistency of the blurred whittle likelihood in section  [ s : prop ] . in section  [ s : implem ]",
    "we discuss semi - parametric inference , likelihood ratio tests and model choice .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : simulations ] we demonstrate our modelling and inference procedures , including a detailed analysis of oceanographic flow and seismic data .",
    "concluding remarks can be found in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "readers only interested in developments for real - valued processes should only refer to sections  [ prelim - real ] , [ whittle - real ] , [ whittle - taper ] , [ s : prop ] and [ ss : simulations1 ] .",
    "the sequence @xmath2 is defined from a corresponding zero - mean continuous - time gaussian process @xmath3 , by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the sampling period and @xmath6 .",
    "assuming that the process is second - order stationary , one may define the autocovariance sequence @xmath7 for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes expectation .",
    "the power spectral density of @xmath2 forms a fourier pair with the autocovariance sequence : @xmath10 the angular frequency @xmath11 $ ] is given in radians . for a sample @xmath12 , a simple , but statistically inconsistent estimate of @xmath13",
    "is the periodogram  denoted @xmath14which is the squared absolute value of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) defined as @xmath15.\\ ] ] using the spectral representation theorem we can write @xmath16 in terms of orthogonal increments @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "note that because @xmath16 is a discrete sequence , @xmath19 has already been aliased .",
    "thus there may be departures between @xmath13 and the continuous - time process spectral density , which we denote as @xmath20 .    a direct consequence of equations   and is that by calculating the dft from a finite sample size , we have automatically  blurred \" the spectral information , due to leakage and aliasing effects .",
    "leakage is associated with the truncation of the sequence @xmath16 over a finite time interval , whereas aliasing results from the discrete sampling of the continuous - time process to generate an infinite sequence ; both effects are a consequence of analysing a sample of a continuous - time process .",
    "as it does not account for these effects , the periodogram is considered a nave estimator of the continuous time process spectral density . the expected value of the periodogram is equal to the convolution of the true spectrum with the fejr kernel ( the magnitude - squared of the dirichlet kernel ) , which can badly bias spectral estimates ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "leakage effects are often tackled by using tapering ( e.g.  @xcite ) which reduces bias and variance at each frequency , at the expense of increased correlation between neighbouring fourier frequencies ; we will discuss this trade - off in more detail in this paper .",
    "the issue of aliasing results in energy outside of the nyquist frequency ( the highest observable frequency , @xmath21 ) being folded back into the observable spectrum , which is often ignored when estimating spectra of continuous sampled processes  @xcite .    the classical approach to frequency - domain inference , the whittle likelihood , makes use of the periodogram and therefore relies on asymptotic behaviours for very large sample sizes to minimise bias effects . in section  [ s : whittle ] , we propose a new modification of the whittle likelihood that directly incorporates finite sampling effects from both leakage and aliasing correctly , which can be used with either the periodogram or tapered spectral estimates .      as is already done in my applications areas , it is often convenient to express bivariate time series as complex - valued .",
    "the real and imaginary parts often represent displacements or velocities in orthogonal spatial directions , and will be henceforth referred to as the _ cartesian components_. a more useful decomposition of the variability , however , is to separate the process into _ rotary components _",
    ", that is , into contributions from positively - rotating and negatively - rotating complex exponentials .",
    "statistical understanding of complex - valued time series , in particular in the frequency domain , has been developed over the past 20 years ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .    to form a complex - valued series , we start from a pair of real - valued sequences , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these processes can be combined to form the complex - valued sequence @xmath24 via @xmath25 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are jointly gaussian and zero mean , such that any collection of the processes at a number of sampled points are gaussian .",
    "therefore to fully characterise their properties we need to specify the joint covariance @xmath26 as well as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the process is stationary then we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as well as @xmath31 for the cross - covariance sequence ; the latter then forms a fourier pair with @xmath32 , as in equation  .",
    "alternatively , in terms of the stationary complex - valued gaussian process @xmath24 , the process may be fully characterised by specifying the covariance and _ relation _ sequence @xmath33 @xmath34 , \\nonumber\\\\ r_{zz}(\\tau)&=&{\\ensuremath{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{e}}}}\\{z_tz_{t-\\tau}\\ } = s_{xx}(\\tau)-s_{yy}(\\tau)+i[s_{xy}(-\\tau)+s_{xy}(\\tau ) ] , \\label{rzz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 denoting the complex conjugate of @xmath36 . clearly specifying @xmath37 and @xmath33 for the complex - valued process",
    "is equivalent to specifying @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for the bivariate real - valued process .",
    "it is directly apparent from equation   that @xmath41 ( hermitian symmetry ) and @xmath42 ( symmetry ) .",
    "the spectrum and complementary spectrum are defined from @xmath37 and @xmath33 via a fourier transform @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum and complementary spectrum together describe the second order properties of the fourier transform of the complex - valued process @xmath24 .",
    "we note that @xmath46 is _ not _ the relation sequence of the fourier - domain orthogonal increment process @xmath47 , but rather is the fourier transform of the relation sequence of @xmath36 .",
    "if the relation sequence , or the complementary spectrum , is zero everywhere then the process is said to be _ proper _ , and otherwise it is _ improper _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a key motivation behind this paper is not to interpret complex - valued time series as bivariate real - valued time series , but instead as processes that have two complex - valued counter rotating components .",
    "this decomposes a process according to the direction of spin .",
    "specifically , we write @xmath48 , \\label{eq : zpluszminus}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are both _ analytic _ , that is , supported only on positive frequencies . under the assumption of stationarity",
    ", the spectra of the two rotary processes are given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , while the cross - spectrum is @xmath53 ; all of these are defined only for @xmath54 , and vanish otherwise .",
    "the relationships between three different representations of a complex - valued process  cartesian ( @xmath55 ) , complex ( @xmath56 ) and rotary ( @xmath57 )  are presented in table  [ table : realcomplex ] .",
    "the derivations can be found in section  [ sm : derivations ] of the appendix .",
    "note that relationships involving @xmath57 do not hold at frequency @xmath58 , as the energy at this frequency is divided between the two rotary components ",
    "these specific relationships can also be found in the appendix .",
    "the rotary components are defined only for positive frequencies as they are analytic and hence equal to zero for negative frequencies .",
    "the relationships between the cartesian and complex / rotary representations are nontrivial , and highlight some of the differences between working with bivariate and complex - valued data .",
    "we will refer to table  [ table : realcomplex ] in future sections to provide more intuition and simplify calculations .",
    "similar expressions relating the covariance ( and relation ) sequences of each representation can be found from table  [ table : realcomplex ] using inverse fourier transforms .    sometimes the decomposition is made slightly differently , such that @xmath59 is analytic and the second component",
    "is defined to be anti - analytic , i.e. have a spectrum only defined on negative frequencies .",
    "we prefer our representation , and consider it more natural as we then only need to specify a covariance structure between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , as the relation sequence is zero everywhere , in contrast to @xcite for example .    at first",
    "the division in equation   may seem artificial and opaque .",
    "one might argue that representing a bivariate time series as complex - valued is unnecessarily complicated , making the inclusion of _ two _ extra complex - valued processes seem yet more redundant .",
    "we shall see that splitting up a process into two components in this way is natural , as it divides the process into forward rotating and reverse rotating phasors , as is clear from equation  .",
    "the rotary decomposition has been used as a modelling tool for many years and across many applications , as detailed in section 1.9 in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss key aspects of the specification of stochastic models for complex - valued time series , including the possibility of coherence between time series components .",
    "specifying rotary coherence is different from specifying cartesian coherence . as a practical example",
    ", we focus on models based on the matrn process .      as real - world time series",
    "may be characterised by significant coherence between components , we must develop stochastic models that are capable of capturing such behaviour .",
    "a common way of defining covariance structure in bivariate series is in the time domain , but in this paper we do this in the frequency domain by modelling the _ frequency - domain coherency_. we represent the cross - spectrum between @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the _ coherency _ of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; @xmath63 is the _ coherence _ , and @xmath64 is the _ group delay _",
    ", quantifying whether @xmath22 or @xmath23 are leading or lagging in time at frequency - cycle @xmath65 .",
    "we refer to @xmath66 as the _ cartesian coherency_. the group delay and coherence must satisfy @xmath67 on account of the hermitian symmetry of @xmath32 .    from a modelling standpoint",
    ", we may also regard equation   as _ specifying _ the cartesian cross - spectrum for a given choice of the individual spectra @xmath13 and @xmath68 , together with a suitable choice of the coherency @xmath66 .",
    "it can be shown that choosing @xmath66 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 does indeed lead to a valid spectral matrix that is always non - negative definite .",
    "realistic functions specifying @xmath63 would include the logistic function @xmath71 as we note directly from equation   that @xmath63 must be an even function .",
    "furthermore it is reasonable to have decaying polynomials such that @xmath72 , which will be the case in equation   provided the highest - order polynomial coefficient is positive , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath64 is odd , we may propose the form @xmath74 the simplest choice for the orders @xmath75 and @xmath76 is @xmath77 , which imposes a simple structure of fixed correlation across all frequencies .",
    "note that while a constant phase is not valid , we may have @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the signum function ; or we may have phase that is locally constant within particular frequency bands ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "next we ask what constraint is imposed on the phase function @xmath64 if we require the time series to be proper .",
    "it follows from table  [ table : realcomplex ] that we require @xmath80 _ and _ @xmath81 in order for the time series to be proper . for the second condition we require that _ at each _ positive frequency @xmath82 , either @xmath83 _ or _ @xmath84 and @xmath85 , such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are strictly  out of phase . \"",
    "the latter possibility follows from the fact that a time series is zero - mean gaussian and proper if and only if it is _ circular _",
    "( i.e. a series whose properties are invariant under rotation ) , see  @xcite .",
    "an example of such would be a deterministic time series which follows an exact circle , which corresponds to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    for spatially generated processes such as the oceanographic time series we shall study subsequently ,",
    "propriety is found to be related to the condition of spatial isotropy , with impropriety in turn implying anisotropy .",
    "thus we can test for anisotropy in the spatial process that generates the sampled time series , and so if the complex - valued time series is generated from a spatial process , we to refer to propriety and isotropy interchangeably .",
    "alternatively one may employ a model which specifies the coherence between rotary components @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "as we have chosen the two to be supported only on positive frequencies however , there can be no covariance between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore in addition to specifying the variance of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , corresponding to specifying the rotary spectra , we only need to model their covariance at the same frequency .",
    "the _ rotary coherency _",
    "@xcite is defined as @xmath92 where again @xmath93 .",
    "taking equation   as a _ model _ for the rotary cross spectrum , we find he flexibility for @xmath94 to vary across frequencies particularly useful . in oceanographic data , for example",
    ", it is unlikely that clockwise and anti - clockwise oscillations will be correlated identically at all frequencies  but at different frequencies we would expect a different mode of correlation , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "another desirable aspect of the rotary model specification is that we can account for the possibility of different slopes governing the spectral decay across positive and negative frequencies . as we shall see later such",
    "would be extremely challenging to incorporate into the model for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but considerably easier to incorporate for the complex - valued rotary decomposition .    as in the cartesian case , one may construct models for the coherence @xmath95 and group delay @xmath96 comparable to equations   and , with the difference that these functions now only need to be supported over positive frequencies .",
    "if we desire to model proper complex - valued series , we see from table  [ table : realcomplex ] that we require that @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "thus , a proper complex - valued time series has no rotary coherency at non - zero frequencies , which is an important interpretation of propriety . as an aside",
    ", we point out that if one desires to model a _",
    "non - zero - mean _ proper time series , we must additionally ensure that @xmath99 vanishes ; this is because @xmath100 only for @xmath101 . modelling the rotary coherency",
    "can be used to formulate a test for impropriety , as is detailed later in section  [ impropriety ] .      to illustrate the specification of a model with frequency - domain coherence",
    ", we will employ a particular type of random process that is in increasingly widespread use .",
    "the matrn process @xcite is a continuous stationary gaussian process that has received much attention in the spatial and spatiotemporal modelling literature . after carrying some theoretical extensions in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will also employ the matrn process in the applications of section  [ s : simulations ] .",
    "the univariate matrn process is a three - parameter , stationary gaussian process with covariance given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the smoothness parameter @xmath105 defines the hausdorff dimension ( equal to max@xmath106 ) and the degree of differentiability of the process , the range parameter @xmath107 is a timescale parameter , where @xmath108 can be referred to as the correlation timescale , and @xmath109 defines the magnitude of the variability of the process .",
    "the matrn is a useful process in time series analysis , as the limiting behaviour over short timescales ( or as @xmath110 ) is like nonstationary fractional brownian motion , whereas the limiting behaviour over long timescales ( or as @xmath111 ) is white noise  the matrn hence provides a continuum between these two regimes over different timescales",
    ". we can therefore view the process as truly multiscale .",
    "the process has the potential to capture complicated structure while simultaneously being parsimonious , yielding useful modelling potential for structured processes with which we wish to infer physically meaningful parameters from relatively few observations .",
    "there has been much interest in constructing valid multivariate matrn processes in the spatial statistics literature . in particular ,  @xcite and @xcite have constructed multivariate matrn processes such that all marginal covariances and cross - covariances are themselves also of matrn type , i.e. for dimensions @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( where @xmath114 ) of the @xmath115-variate process @xmath116 @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( which is trivially set to 1 if @xmath119 ) , @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the univariate matern covariance function defined in equation  .",
    "@xcite specifies necessary and sufficient conditions for the bivariate matrn process ( @xmath122 ) to have cross - covariances that are of matrn type and for the covariance matrix to be nonnegative definite . in this paper , however , we choose to specify the cross - covariance structure in the frequency domain .",
    "our rationale for this choice is twofold .",
    "first , for the oceanography application we study , it is easier to specify the covariance of the flow process in terms of specially chosen complex - valued processes from physical considerations .",
    "second , it is very easy to check whether a specified choice corresponds to a valid covariance ( we simply require @xmath123 in equation  ) , unlike the torturous calculations sometimes necessary in the time domain .",
    "the spectrum of the continuous - time matrn process has a succinct and interpretable representation : @xmath124 where @xmath20 indicates the spectral density of the continuous - time process .",
    "this relates to the aliased spectral density of a sequence @xmath2as defined in equation  via the relationship @xmath125 for @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "we can specify that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are matrn processes with spectra that follow the form given in equation  , for @xmath127 .",
    "we denote these parameters as @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which are permitted to differ between the processes .",
    "if we specify a model for the cross - spectra using equation  , then the overall process is valid as long as @xmath123 . by ",
    "valid \" we mean it possesses an invertible covariance / spectral matrix , but not necessarily a cross - covariance / cross - spectrum that is also matrn , _ unlike _ the definition of  @xcite . in this sense",
    "our specification is more general , particularly as we can propose frequency - dependent coherence .",
    "if we do wish to formulate cross - spectra that are of matrn form , we can set @xmath130 and @xmath94 as real - valued and constant across frequency , but still allow @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "it is easy to show using equation  , that this specifies a valid matrn as per the @xcite definition , however for comparison , we verify that this parameterisation also meets the conditions required by  @xcite , in section  [ sm : matern ] of the appendix .      finally , it is interesting to discuss the matrn family in the context of a transformation framework , which we will make use of later in the applications .",
    "we define the deformation operator @xmath133 , where @xmath75 is an amplitude scaling transformation and @xmath134 is a temporal dilation or compression .",
    "we take @xmath135 , @xmath136 , assuming that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are independent realisations of the same stochastic process .",
    "this deforms the original stochastic processes and also introduces correlations .",
    "it follows that @xmath139 , and we see that the processes remain jointly stationary , but stretched or compressed in time by the factor @xmath134 .",
    "if we look at the cross - spectrum then it transpires that it takes the form @xmath140 we find that if @xmath141 takes a matrn form , then so does @xmath142 , but with altered parameters .",
    "both @xmath143 and @xmath144 change from such deformations but not @xmath145 .",
    "this indicates how a jointly matrn process can be generated by a simple transformation of an original matrn .",
    "alternatively we may combine a matrn process in each of the two cartesian or rotary components , with the parametric specification of coherency discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2 .",
    "choosing the rotary representation , and setting the damping and slope parameters of the positive and negative rotary components to be equal , the form of the spectral matrix becomes @xmath146 where the coherence function @xmath94 remains to be specified .",
    "this type of bivariate model would regulate _ the same _ scaling behaviour between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , but the energy of each process being individually regulated by @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we use this model to capture both isotropic and anisotropic structure in oceanographic flow processes in section  [ ss : simulations2 ] .",
    "the usefulness of the matrn family is that multiscale behaviour is achievable from one single family . a subtle issue , however , is the relationship between the rotary and cartesian decompositions .",
    "specifying two matrns with unequal slope and/or range parameters in one representation will , in general , force the other to posses a mixture of matrns ; this can be inferred from the identities in table  [ table : realcomplex ] . in general",
    ", a matrn specified in @xmath59 and @xmath60 only specifies a matrn in @xmath22 and @xmath23 if @xmath130 and @xmath149 , and if @xmath150 and @xmath151 are constant across frequencies such that the cross - spectra are coincidentally of matrn form even when @xmath152 or @xmath131 . ] ; the reverse it also true . in such cases the cross - spectra @xmath32 and @xmath142 are in general complex - valued and out - of - phase .",
    "this means that a simple model in one decomposition does not lead to a simple model in the other , and the practitioner must therefore understand the data and the processes driving the data to find the simplest decomposition in which to model .",
    "in this section we turn to the problem of estimating the parameters of a chosen model from observations .",
    "maximum likelihood is the preferred approach but has two drawbacks .",
    "first , its large computational cost renders it unwieldy to apply in practice ; this is due to the computational cost associated with inverting the full time - domain covariance matrix .",
    "second , we wish to parameterise the structure in terms of properties of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which is not conveniently implemented in the time - domain .",
    "the method we shall choose , however , will closely _ approximate _ the time - domain log - likelihood , preserving its desirable qualities .",
    "henceforth we let @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate length  @xmath0 samples of the corresponding random processes arranged as column vectors . in the univariate case of a sample @xmath22 from a zero - mean real - valued gaussian process , after choosing a particular parametric model characterised by a vector of parameters @xmath153 , the time domain log - likelihood can be written as @xmath154 where we note that the subscript  @xmath155 \" is a label standing for  time \" , the superscript ",
    "@xmath156 \" denotes the transpose , and the superscript ",
    "@xmath157 \" is the matrix inverse . here",

    "the periodogram is in general an inconsistent and biased measure of the continuous time process spectral density , due to the blurring caused by leakage and aliasing effects .",
    "it is important to note that the desirable properties of the whittle likelihood rely on the _ asymptotic _ behaviour of the periodogram for very large sample sizes . in order to prevent problems with the periodogram for finite sample sizes from adversely affecting our inference process",

    "it can readily be shown that if @xmath22 is drawn from a process with a given theoretical spectrum , the expected value of its periodogram @xmath186 will blur the theoretical spectrum in precisely the same way .",
    "therefore the bias in the estimation process caused by leakage and aliasing arising from finite sample effects has now been correctly accounted for .",
    "we call this the _ blurred whittle likelihood _ and prove consistency of estimators in section  [ s : prop ] , as well as document its performance in a monte carlo study in section  [ ss : simulations1 ] .",
    "the usual form of the whittle likelihood can be computed efficiently by using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) to calculate the dft , which is an @xmath1 operation .",
    "the blurred whittle likelihood however , is slightly more complicated to compute as @xmath187 must now be calculated . the best way to do",
    "this is by working with the fourier pair of the blurred theoretical spectrum @xmath188 , which is the expected biased sampled autocovariance sequence of length @xmath189 , denoted @xmath190 for @xmath191 , @xmath192    observe that the truncation to finite length has the effect of multiplying the true autocovariance sequence with the triangle kernel .",
    "in fact , both aliasing and leakage effects are automatically accounted for in equation  ; the effect of _ aliasing _ is accounting for by sampling the theoretical autocovariance function at discrete times , while the effect of _ leakage _ due to the truncation of the sample to finite length is accounted for by the triangle kernel . by forming the blurred and aliased spectrum @xmath188 in this way from a _ time domain _ multiplication",
    ", we avoid an expensive summation over the aliased frequencies , and the algorithm may still be performed in @xmath177 operations .    note that if the closed form of the autocovariance sequence is unknown , then we can inverse fourier transform the modelled spectrum of the process to approximate the autocovariance sequence numerically ( see equation  ) .",
    "subsequently we would take the fourier transform of this sequence , multiplied with the triangle kernel ( as in equation  ) , to recover an estimate of @xmath187 , still in @xmath1 operations .",
    "as an aside , we note that computing the whittle likelihood with the aliased , but not blurred , spectrum @xmath193defined in equation  can be complicated , as this seldom has an analytic form and must be instead approximated by either arithmetically wrapping in contributions from frequencies higher than the nyquist , or via an approximation to the fourier transform in equation  .",
    "this is in contrast to the blurred whittle likelihood , where the blurred spectrum can be computed exactly in one operation , as in equation  .",
    "it is therefore easier to incorporate both leakage and aliasing effects together , rather than separately .",
    "so far we have encountered the time - domain likelihood , the standard whittle likelihood , and the blurred whittle likelihood .",
    "there is a fourth possible likelihood that could be defined by extending the whittle likelihood to tapered discrete fourier transforms @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to replacing the direct spectral estimator formed from @xmath174 in equation   with one using the taper @xmath194 @xmath195 where @xmath196 is real - valued . setting @xmath197 recovers the periodogram estimate of equation  .",

    "both the blurred tapered and blurred periodogram likelihoods have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "tapering reduces broadband leakage , but increases variance ( by effectively throwing away statistical information ) and also increases correlations between local frequencies .",
    "the periodogram may exhibit greater global bias and correlation with other frequencies , on account of the implicit convolution with the fejr kernel ; the magnitude of this effect depends on the degree of dynamic range of the observed process in frequency .",
    "we explore the comparison between these various methods , and demonstrate the importance of blurring the likelihood , through monte carlo simulations in section  [ ss : simulations1 ] .      in the previous section ,",
    "modified versions of the whittle likelihood appropriate for a single real - valued time series were developed .",
    "next we construct the whittle likelihood for complex - valued time series .",
    "we start from the bivariate whittle likelihood @xcite and then reformulate this for rotary ( @xmath57 ) and complex ( @xmath56 ) components using the relationships given in section  [ prelim - complex ] .",
    "while the whittle likelihood is normally derived with continuous - time spectra @xmath204 ( see equation  ) , for notational simplicity in this subsection we formulate in terms of aliased spectra for sampled sequences , denoted @xmath13 , as defined in equation  ; the representations however do not change for continuous - time spectra .",
    "we first define the cartesian spectral matrix and the cartesian fourier transform vector as @xmath205 using these definitions , the standard bivariate likelihood is  @xcite @xmath206,\\ ] ] where again @xmath172 is the set of discrete fourier frequencies : @xmath173 .",
    "we note that this likelihood is the bivariate form of equation  , and it approximates the bivariate likelihood of @xmath181 given in equation  .",
    "the bivariate likelihood   can be equivalently expressed in term of the rotary components , as will now be shown .",
    "we start by defining the rotary spectral matrix and rotary fourier vector : @xmath207 the complex - valued length-@xmath0 sequences @xmath208 and @xmath209 are defined implicitly by equation   for @xmath210 .",
    "there is a simple linear relationship between @xmath211 and @xmath212 @xmath213 as can be seen directly from @xmath214 together with equation  . by inverting equation",
    "we have that @xmath215 we then substitute equation   into equation   @xmath216.\\label{eq : complexsub}\\ ] ] by expanding and rearranging , and using @xmath217 at @xmath127 , we see that @xmath218 which from table  [ table : realcomplex ] is simply equal to @xmath219 , meaning that equation   simplifies to @xmath220 , \\label{whittle_rotary}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 denotes equality up to an additive constant .",
    "the whittle likelihood for complex - valued time series , given by equation  , is therefore equivalent to the bivariate likelihood of equation  .",
    "the blurred , tapered , and blurred / tapered versions of the whittle likelihood for complex - valued series can similarly be computed by inserting the appropriately modified versions of the rotary spectral matrix , and/or the fourier transform vector , into equation  .",
    "for example , if we wish to retain the blurred whittle likelihood analysis for complex - valued time series we evaluate @xmath222 , \\label{complex_whittle_2 } \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\overline{s}_\\pm(\\omega;\\bm{\\theta})&=&\\int_{-\\pi/\\delta}^{\\pi/\\delta}s_\\pm(\\omega';\\bm{\\theta}){\\cal f}_n\\left(\\omega'-\\omega\\right)\\;d\\omega',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for tapered versions .",
    "as discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 , these can all be computed in @xmath223 operations .",
    "one detail regarding the whittle likelihood in terms of its rotary representation is that frequency @xmath58 can not be included in the range of estimation , owing to complications in defining the rotary spectra for zero frequency , see section a in the appendix .",
    "this is usually not a restrictive requirement , as in practice the time series is often differenced or has had its mean removed , such that the zero - frequency content of the time series is lost in any case , and there is no value in including this in the likelihood summation .",
    "if this is not the case however , and the frequency content of the signal at @xmath58 is appreciable , then the whittle likelihood can be represented in terms of @xmath224 and @xmath46 , which is of identical form to equation   but can include @xmath58 .",
    "we note that for proper time series , when @xmath225 , this form of likelihood has the simple form @xmath226,\\ ] ] where this time @xmath172 is the set of positive and negative discrete fourier frequencies , which is the length @xmath0 sequence @xmath227 .",
    "observe that the likelihood for a proper complex - valued time series has the same form as that for a real - valued univariate time series , see for example equation  .",
    "it is known that standard whittle likelihood provides a consistent estimator of the spectrum @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we establish consistency and related properties of the blurred whittle likelihood .",
    "the main difficulty in the proof is that , although the blurred whittle likelihood accounts for the bias of the periodogram , there is still present the broadband correlation between frequencies .",
    "this is what prevents the blurred whittle likelihood being exactly equal to the time - domain maximum likelihood for gaussian data .    to establish consistency , we need to bound the asymptotic behaviour of this correlation .",
    "the statement is provided below in theorem 1 , with the proof provided in the appendix ( section  [ sm : consistency ] ) . the proof is composed of three propositions which provide bounds , in turn , for the covariance of the dft , the variance of linear combinations of the periodogram , and finally the score and hessian of the blurred whittle likelihood .",
    "together these establish that the blurred whittle likelihood is a consistent estimator converging with probability at rate @xmath228 .",
    "we prove consistency for real - valued series , but the result naturally extends to complex - valued series also .",
    "this is because the fourier transform is complex - proper , even if the process itself is not , as long the process is stationary .",
    "this result requires that the spectrum , @xmath13 , is bounded from above and below , and that the blurred whittle likelihood , @xmath229 , is twice differentiable in @xmath153 .",
    "standard theory shows that the standard whittle likelihood approach is consistent with a @xmath230 rate if the spectrum is twice differentiable in @xmath65 and bounded below and above by a non - zero constant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while the rate of convergence we prove is somewhat slower than that for the standard whittle likelihood , our method of proof requires weaker assumptions , as it does _ not _ require the assumption that the spectrum is differentiable in @xmath65 , and is near constant over widths of the fejer kernel . in practice , we find the benefits in bias reduction more than make up for the slower guaranteed rate of convergence .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the variances of the standard and blurred whittle estimators will behave similarly asymptotically , as sums of weighted periodograms will behave similarly whether weighted by quantities involving @xmath231 or @xmath13 .",
    "assume that the sequence @xmath2 is a zero - mean second - order stationary discrete process where @xmath184 , defined in equation  , is twice differentiable in @xmath232 .",
    "assume that the spectral density of @xmath16 is bounded above by the finite value @xmath233 and below by the non - zero value @xmath234 .",
    "then the estimator @xmath235 for a sample @xmath12 , with @xmath229 being the blurred whittle likelihood defined in equation  , satisfies @xmath236    we may conclude from theorem 1 that @xmath237 is a consistent estimator . note that for simplicity , and without loss of generality , we set @xmath238 in this section .",
    "having established consistency , we can use this to obtain variance estimates of the blurred whittle estimators . from equations  , and in the appendix we see that @xmath239 where the matrix @xmath240 is defined entrywise by @xmath241 .",
    "the matrix @xmath240 can be approximated  numerically , if the analytic form is not known  by evaluating the hessian at @xmath237 .",
    "the remaining term , @xmath242 , is the likelihood score , and to estimate its variance we substitute from equation  , noting that @xmath243 , and then express the partial derivative in each element of @xmath153 separately , to obtain @xmath244 where we have defined @xmath245 in deriving this expression we have made use of the fact that the @xmath246 term is deterministic and therefore does not contribute to the variance . as we have established consistency for @xmath237 we can now use the invariance principle to construct an estimator of @xmath247 we find that because @xmath237 is consistent we first take @xmath248 , and then to estimate the covariance of the periodogram we approximate the integral @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the dirichlet kernel ( see equation   of the appendix ) .",
    "this provides estimates of the variance of the estimators .",
    "normality of @xmath237 follows because proposition 3 in the supplementary material shows that @xmath251 converges in probability to a positive constant , and @xmath252 is a gaussian quadratic form where the diagonalised representation does not put too much mass at any individual variate ; thus the sum will be a gaussian random variable . to further investigate what controls the variance of the estimators , we explore how the score behaves .",
    "the score is zero mean ( for any finite @xmath0 ) , and the variance ( as derived in equation   of the appendix ) can be bounded by @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 are upper bounds on the spectrum and the partial derivative of the blurred spectrum respectively , and @xmath256 is a lower bound on the blurred spectrum .",
    "the significance of equation   is that the magnitude of the variance of the score is controlled by the dynamic range of the spectrum .",
    "a high dynamic range increases the value of the first ratio in the bound @xmath257 .",
    "this advocates differencing a sampled process with steep spectral slopes , as reducing this ratio will reduce the variance of the estimators , taking care to omit the zero frequency from the fit .",
    "this is consistent with numerical simulations performed in @xcite , where the whittle likelihood was found to perform poorly with fractionally differenced processes that were more smooth .",
    "indeed , we will demonstrate the effectiveness of fitting to the differenced process , if the process itself has a high dynamic range , with a numerical example in section  [ ss : simulations1 ] .",
    "in this section we discuss several issues that arise in applying the inference method developed in the previous sections to complex - valued time series .",
    "as discussed in section  [ whittle - real ] , the whittle likelihood for real and complex - valued time series can be performed over a reduced range of frequencies @xmath172 , such that inference is semi - parametric .",
    "we note work by @xcite and related papers by this author , in which frequency - domain inference is performed semi - parametrically .",
    "in contrast to our work , the @xcite approach is aimed at inferring long - memory processes such as fractional brownian motion and there is no bias correction performed in the whittle likelihood .",
    "we propose using semi - parametric inference for different reasons .",
    "primarily , frequencies can be omitted from the likelihood when the chosen model is only correctly specified within a certain range of frequencies .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the movement of surface drifter pairs exhibit different spectral slopes for certain ranges of frequencies .",
    "if we are only interested in inferring parameters of one of the slopes , for example , then this can be performed semi - parametrically by constraining @xmath172 accordingly .",
    "a second use of semi - parametric inference is that high frequencies can be omitted to account for sampling bias such as measurement uncertainty , which will contaminate high frequencies the most .",
    "we note however , that without a full model for the spectrum at all frequencies , then not all blurring and aliasing effects can be incorporated into the blurred whittle likelihood , although this was found to have limited effect in the practical examples studied in section  [ s : simulations ] .",
    "care should be taken if the omitted frequencies have high spectral energy , as unknown leakage and aliasing effects could bias estimation .      in sections  [ prelim - corr ] and [ prelim - rotary ] we defined the coherence between components of a complex - valued time series , in particular , between the rotary components @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we may wish to test a proposed model for coherence against the simpler scenario where @xmath97 for all @xmath65 .",
    "this hypothesis corresponds to there being no relationship between the positive rotating and negative rotating phasors .",
    "we note from table  [ table : realcomplex ] that this hypothesis is _ not _ equivalent to @xmath258 ; rather , a process with zero rotary cross - spectra , @xmath97 , is equivalent to a proper process , @xmath225 , for @xmath127 .",
    "this is a deliberate and convenient consequence of the way we have constructed @xmath59 and @xmath60 to _ both _ be analytic .",
    "testing for impropriety in the time domain is then equivalent to testing for a non - zero cross - spectrum between rotary components in the frequency domain .",
    "there are many tests for impropriety using data sets of multiple replicates of complex - valued vectors , see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that these are _ non - parametric tests _ using replicated complex - valued vectors . here , by contrast , we have a simple _ parametric _ time series model suitable for a _ single time series _ , and will derive a test statistic for this scenario .    for example , we have proposed to study the matrn model in section  [ s : matern ] , and can estimate suitable parameters for @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath143 by using the whittle likelihood , which can be permitted to differ across the cartesian or rotary components as discussed .",
    "we can also estimate the coherence structure by specifying a model for @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we may however prefer to use the simpler model where @xmath97 and we can make use of the parametric model  in combination with the whittle likelihood for complex - valued series  to perform a likelihood ratio test to check for evidence if @xmath259 ( in equation  ) such that @xmath260 .",
    "specifically , this is done by computing the likelihood ratio statistic @xmath261 where @xmath262 includes non - zero estimates for the coherency @xmath263 , while for @xmath264 , @xmath265 for all @xmath65 .",
    "the exact type of whittle likelihood used in equation   ( tapered / periodogram or standard / blurred ) can be selected from section  [ s : whittle ] .",
    "if we use the time domain bivariate likelihood ( see equation  ) in equation  , the likelihood ratio statistic @xmath266 is asymptotically distributed according to a @xmath267 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of extra parameters @xmath115 in the alternative hypothesis versus the null .",
    "this follows from standard likelihood theory . in the appendix ( section  [ sm : ht ] )",
    ", we prove that the whittle likelihood for complex - valued series does yield a likelihood ratio statistic with a @xmath267 distribution , for special cases which include the practical example studied later in section  [ ss : simulations2 ] .",
    "for the blurred whittle likelihood , the asymptotic properties of @xmath266 are more subtle , and care must be taken when the dynamic range of the spectrum is large . for standard processes , or after suitable differencing to lower the dynamic range ,",
    "it is reasonable however to assume a @xmath267 distribution , as discussed in section  [ sm : ht ] .",
    "we note that in the case of the coherency structure proposed in equations   and , the degrees of freedom @xmath268 , which in the special case of a constant coefficient across frequencies with no group delay the number of degrees of freedom becomes @xmath269 .",
    "once the appropriate alternate model has been chosen , we can conduct hypothesis tests against the @xmath267 distribution to test for evidence of impropriety , and if multiple series are available , the user can contrast findings with non - parametric methods .",
    "we investigate this test for impropriety with a practical example in section  [ ss : simulations2 ] .      in many practical scenarios , the most appropriate choice for a model , and",
    "the corresponding number of parameters , is unknown _",
    "a priori_. when it is possible to define a model such that possible candidate models are _",
    "nested_that is , with simpler models being recovered from a more complete model by setting certain parameters to constants  then it is possible to apply the method of _ model choice_. as an example , for a range of arma(p , q ) , processes , the akaike information criterion ( aic ) can be used to find the most appropriate choice of @xmath115 and @xmath270 .",
    "similarly , model choice can be used to select between a matrn and fractional brownian motion  as the spectrum of fractional brownian motion is nested functionally ( but not formally ) inside that of a matrn ( by setting @xmath271 in equation  ) .",
    "model choice can also be used to check if certain parameter values are correctly known _ a priori _ , such as the slope parameter @xmath145 in the matrn process , which is assumed for physical reasons to be a fixed known value for certain oceanographic time series ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the aic can be closely approximated in the frequency domain using the whittle likelihood .",
    "this is done by using the whittle likelihood to approximate the time - domain likelihood and combining this with a model penalisation parameter as in @xcite : @xmath272 where @xmath115 is the number of parameters in the model . the model with the smallest aic value",
    "is then selected . for small sample sizes ,",
    "it is often recommended to use a correction to the aic known as the aicc , which for complex - valued time series is given by @xmath273 which converges to the aic for large sample sizes .",
    "the correction uses @xmath274 ( rather than @xmath0 as would be done for real - valued time series ) as there are @xmath274 degrees of freedom in a length @xmath0 complex - valued time series . in the case of semi - parametric estimation ,",
    "equation   should not be used , as the sample - size correction needs to take account of degrees of freedom in the data not used in the estimation .",
    "we instead replace @xmath0 by @xmath275 in equation  , which is the number of fourier frequencies used in the frequency range @xmath172 .",
    "when a tapered spectral estimate is used in whittle likelihood estimation , then the degrees of freedom are further reduced by the correlation induced in neighbouring fourier frequencies by the taper .",
    "this loss of resolution is also known as narrowband blurring , in contrast to the broadband blurring which is attributed to the leakage of the fejr kernel in the periodogram for example . without tapering , nominally each fourier coefficient ,",
    "spaced @xmath276 apart , are uncorrelated ; however , with tapering , coefficients spaced @xmath277 are approximately uncorrelated , where @xmath278 is some constant reflecting the implicit bandwidth of frequency - domain smoothing .",
    "we must then further reduce @xmath275 by a factor of @xmath279 in the aicc , which can be computed by fourier transforming the taper onto a fine grid and then finding the frequency width where the transformed sequence is only correlated below some threshold ( such as 0.05 ) .",
    "in this section we present several real - world examples that apply the modelling and inference methods we have developed for complex - valued time series , as well as a monte carlo study to investigate the performance of the blurred whittle likelihood for simulated data .",
    "all data and matlab^^ code used to generate the results in this section can be found at www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/spg/software , along with accompanying documentation , including a technical description of how the numerical simulation in section  [ ss : simulations2 ] was performed .",
    "the numerical simulation can also be reproduced using the software available at jeffreyearly.com / numerical - models/.      in section  [ s : whittle ] , we presented several frequency - domain approximations to the standard time - domain maximum likelihood , and advocated the use of the blurred whittle likelihood ( @xmath280 in equation  ) or the tapered blurred whittle likelihood ( @xmath281 in equation  ) .",
    "these methods adjust for bias from leakage and aliasing , while maintaining the @xmath1 efficiency of the standard whittle likelihood . in this section",
    "we investigate the effectiveness of blurring the whittle likelihood in a monte carlo study using data from a real - valued matrn process , and then study the parameter estimates for each type of likelihood .",
    "recalling the motivating example in the introduction , we set our parameters to representative values for a surface drifter trajectory ( @xmath282 in equation  ) which would be a good fit to the time - windowed spectra displayed in figure  [ figintro ] , excluding the two peaks representing other oscillatory oceanographic processes .",
    "table [ table : mc2 ] displays the results of our monte carlo study with @xmath283 where we have averaged over 10,000 repeats to remove sampling variability yielding small standard errors of the performance metrics ( the standard error of the bias is equal to the standard deviation divided by 100 ) .",
    "note that we include results for two tapers : a discrete prolate spheroidal sequence taper ( of order zero , see @xcite ) and a full cosine taper @xcite .",
    "the optimisation is performed in matlab^^ using ` fminsearch ` and uses identical settings for all likelihoods , where initial values for the slope and amplitude are found by performing least squares on the spectral slope , with the initial guess for the damping parameter @xmath143 set to equal 10 times the rayleigh frequency , such that it is non - zero .",
    "the time - domain estimator marginally outperforms the blurred whittle methods , as expected from the optimal properties of the maximum likelihood estimator , but at a considerable computational expense ",
    "the optimisation is two orders of magnitude slower than the whittle likelihood . for large data sets , such as that collected from the global drifter program",
    ", this burden is significant when computing across many million data points over rolling windows of time .",
    "in addition , for complex - valued time series , we may wish to specify rotary models in the frequency domain , which are not easy to formulate in the time - domain .    of the whittle estimators , the blurred versions ( both periodogram and tapered ) perform significantly better than the standard form , both in terms of bias and root mean square error ( rmse ) .",
    "this is due to accounting for both aliasing and leakage effects , though the degree to which each of these effects matter will depend on the process and its dynamic range .",
    "the blurred likelihood using the periodogram returns biases and errors that are extremely close to that of maximum likelihood , at a fraction of the computational cost .",
    "the biases and errors may be found to be relatively larger with process with a higher dynamic range , but in such cases we find good results by differencing the process , and fitting this differenced process to the spectrum of the _ first difference _ of a sampled matrn process ( see the discussion of section  [ s : prop ] ) .",
    "the additional computational cost of blurring  requiring a second fourier transform  is very small compared to the standard approach , and in this experiment it is preferable to use the periodogram rather than tapered spectral estimates .",
    "there have been recent developments in proposing @xmath1 approximations to maximum likelihood in the time domain made in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these methods use hutchinson trace estimators and circulant embedding , thus removing the need to calculate a matrix inverse or determinant .",
    "we contrast our approaches here using the matlab package  scalagauss \" supplied by those authors at http://press3.mcs.anl.gov / scala - gauss / software/. we use the parameters selected in their example code for a matrn process , which only estimates the damping parameter , and assumes the slope parameter is known , and the amplitude parameter is known up to a proportion of the damping parameter",
    ". the parameters used , when transformed into the form of equation  [ e : maternacvs ] , are @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "as the slope parameter is very high with respect to the damping parameter , we fit the blurred whittle likelihood to the differenced process for better resolution .",
    "we perform 10,000 repeats and report the results in table  [ table : mc3 ] .",
    "the method of @xcite returns estimation errors that are only slightly superior to those for the blurred whittle likelihood , however , this method requires an order of magnitude more processing time than the frequency - domain method .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the @xcite method is numerically far more complicated than the blurred whittle likelihood : whereas our method can be implemented in around 10 lines of code , the circulant embedding method requires several hundred , and also requires generating random numbers for the hutchinson trace estimators .",
    "furthermore , the online code provided in the scalagauss package only estimates one matrn parameter , it is not clear how easily the code can be generalised to estimate all 3 matrn parameters , as we have performed in the previous experiment in table  [ table : mc2 ] .    to speed up the @xcite method , we have included results with a faster version which uses only 1 hutchinson trace estimator ( as opposed to the 50 used in the example code ) , but this method is still slower than the blurred likelihood and now yields slightly worse estimation accuracy .",
    "overall , as with table  [ table : mc2 ] , the reported biases are very small compared to the standard deviations ( where the standard error of the bias is the standard deviation divided by 100 ) .",
    "therefore no significance should be placed on the ordering of estimators in terms of bias , other than the poor performance of the standard whittle likelihood .",
    "this type of matrn process produces time series that appear nonstationary , and as documented by @xcite , standard whittle likelihood performs poorly in such scenarios unless tapering is used , as can also be seen in table  [ table : mc3 ] . with the blurred likelihood however",
    ", the poor properties of the periodogram are corrected , and we see that there is no advantage to be gained by using the tapered spectral estimates .      in this section",
    "we show the advantages of modelling bivariate processes in terms of their rotary decomposition .",
    "specifically we track the spatial trajectories of particles over time from two sets of numerical experiments , snapshots of which are displayed in figure  [ figvorticities ] . here",
    "trajectories of particles are computed from the time - varying velocity fields associated with quasi - steady state forced - dissipative two - dimensional turbulence simulations under both isotropic ( @xmath183-plane ) and anisotropic ( @xmath134-plane ) dynamics .",
    "such simulations are standard in oceanography , see e.g. @xcite for details .",
    "we model the velocities of the lagrangian trajectories as complex - valued time series following a matrn process , where energy is equally divided between rotary components such that @xmath286 the motivation for using the matrn is based on observations : both the matrn and lagrangian trajectories such as these exhibit close to power law behaviour at mid - to - high frequencies ( see the review paper of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in contrast to fractional brownian motion , the power law behaviour of a matrn breaks at low frequency making the process stationary ( and not self - similar )  this is again consistent with @xcite where ocean - flow velocities are expected to be stationary , approximately gaussian and have finite spectral energy at very low frequencies .",
    "in addition to modelling the two rotary components as matrn processes having the same parameters , we also account for potential anisotropy by modelling the rotary coherence .",
    "this is done using the following 1-parameter model : @xmath287 where we set @xmath288 ; thus , the full model now has a total of four parameters .",
    "this simple coherence model naturally defines a timescale at which anisotropy begins , as the coherence is zero at @xmath289 , corresponding to a period of @xmath290 , and then increases linearly as frequency decreases until at long timescales all energy is in the dominant cartesian component .",
    "equation   defines the rotary cross - spectrum and should be correctly blurred , together with the spectrum of the matrn process ( equation  ) , as detailed in section  [ s : whittle ] .",
    "the appropriateness of the blurred whittle likelihood fit is displayed in figure  [ figanisofit ] for a trajectory from the anisotropic numerical simulation shown in the left panel of fig  2 .",
    "here we have used a semi - parametric fit by excluding the upper half of the frequency range ( @xmath291 ) and well as the zero frequency as we can not estimate @xmath292 here .",
    "the extra parameter in our model has succinctly captured the difference between the flow in each cartesian component ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) at low frequencies .",
    "thus the matrn model plus frequency - domain coherence as in equation   appears to generally be a good fit for these complex - valued trajectories .",

    "we can then use a likelihood ratio test as described in section  [ impropriety ] to test for evidence of anisotropy . for consistency",
    ", we also repeat this procedure with the same number of trajectories ( of the same length ) from the isotropic experiment in figure  [ figvorticities ] ( right ) to see if we correctly do not reject the null in such cases .",
    "the set of likelihood ratio test statistics from both experiments is displayed in figure  [ figanisohist ] ( left ) .",
    "the statistics are compared with the 95% one - sided confidence interval for the @xmath299 distribution , as there is only 1 additional parameter in the anisotropic model .",

    "this is in agreement with a type i error level set to 5% . in experimental rather than",
    "controlled data we would account for multiple testing issues if performing this test over multiple trials , applying techniques such as false discovery rates .",
    "in addition to the anisotropy , the timescale associated with these anisotropies are of interest .",
    "because the data was simulated , we can assess which frequencies are associated with the anisotropic behaviour from the settings . a spatial scale known as the rhines scale  @xcite , well known in oceanography , determines the scale at which the transition to anisotropic large - scale behaviour begins ; this can be converted to a temporal scale through a division by the root - mean - square velocity .",
    "this gives a time - scale of approximately 23 days for the anisotropic experiment .",
