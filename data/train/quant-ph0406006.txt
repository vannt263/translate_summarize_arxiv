    "there seems to be no doubt in the literature that entanglement of quantum mechanical states is one of the important ingredients in the broad field of quantum information theory .",
    "many protocols in this area are based on entangled states , it is the basis of quantum cryptography @xcite , super dense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite and other fields . although it is an important ingredient entanglement",
    "is even called puzzling , and especially genuine multipartite entanglement for 3- and 4-qubits is a field of active research , because only for two qubits a correct measure for their entanglement is available .",
    "+ in this paper we will give a new method of characterization of 3- and 4-qubit entanglement .",
    "+ in the following we will show how different measures for quantifying entanglement can be applied to a model spin system which can be used as a basis for many different experimental setups .",
    "it is a one - dimensional heisenberg spin system with different arrangements for 3- and 4 spins .",
    "we will compare a global entanglement measure @xcite with the results of bell inequalities in the form proposed by mermin and klyshko @xcite which means that we look for a measure with optimized polynomial spin operators .",
    "it will be shown that the optimized polynomials measure the different degrees of entanglement astonishing well .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows : in chapter ii a special form of bell inequalities is described for 3- and 4-qubit systems.we also define a new method how to handle these polynomial inequalities . in chapter iii",
    "we shortly discuss the global entanglement measure and describe its relation to concurrences as well as to 3-qubit tangle measure . in chapter iv these measures are applied to the general greenberger horne zeilinger ( ghz ) state for 3-qubits and the surprising result is that the optimized mermin - klyshko operators are well suited to describe the entanglement as well as the global entanglement over a wide range of parameters . in chapter",
    "v we now apply these different measures to the special form of a 3-qubit heisenberg spin system and again it turned out that for the pure eigenstates and for the superposition of these eigenstates the optimized bell operator as well as the global entanglement measure are in excellent agreement describing the entanglement . in chapter",
    "vi we have a look at a 4-qubit system and compare it with the 3-qubit results .",
    "a discussion follows in the concluding chapter vii .",
    "from bell - inequalities various polynomials are known for entanglement - classifications .",
    "we use here the mermin - klyshko polynomials which were discussed by yu et al .",
    "@xcite in their classififcation scheme .",
    "we propose a special optimization procedure to give a quantitative analyse of heisenberg spin models .",
    "+ we test our method for 3-qubit systems and then apply it to 4-qubits , where it is shown that the resulting optimized mermin - klyshko operators are able to quantitatively describe the total entanglement measures . furthermore , comparing it with the sum of the 2-qubit concurrences the difference gives a measure to the additional 3- and 4-qubit entanglements .",
    "we note already here that the optimization procedure yields many equivalent minima , therefore it is not possible to extract directly a single well defined operator polynomial .      for 3-qubits",
    "the polynomials can be written as products of spin operators @xcite : @xmath0 where the operators are written as sums of pauli matrices .",

    "we look for the maximum of the absolute values of the expectation values of these polynomials and find for pure product states : @xmath12 the other inequalities found in @xcite can be written as @xmath13 if the state is 2-qubit entangled and @xmath14 if the state is 3-qubit entangled . +",
    "our method consists in a numerical optimization of the components of the vectors @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 of these polynomials .",
    "we used the nag library function e04ucc with randomly chosen initial conditions .",
    "+ since it was not clear from @xcite we applied two different methods . in the first approach",
    "we look for the expectation value of @xmath15 and maximize it .",
    "the polynomial @xmath16 is calculated with these paramters and then the sum @xmath17 is determined .",
    "+ in the second approach we directly maximized the sum of the squares since all these inequalities are sufficient but not necessary . by comparing the results of the optimization with each other and with other measures of entanglement we found that the first described method , the optimization of the @xmath18operator yields the best information .",
    "+ since we have not seen this numerical investigation even for the simplest states used in the literature we cite the following results , obtained with the first described method . + for the ghz - state @xcite @xmath19 : @xmath20 while for the so - called w - state @xcite @xmath21 we can list the following results which show that there seems to be a 3-party entanglement although compared to ghz it has not the maximum possible value . @xmath22      the sufficient conditions for 4-qubits are a little more involved since we have to introduce an additional spin polynomial for the @xmath23 qubit but we can write altogether @xmath24 where @xmath15 and @xmath25 are defined in ( [ f3 ] ) resp .",
    "( [ f3s ] ) and @xmath26 are the spin operators on the @xmath23 qubit @xmath27 .",

    "4-qubit entanglement means a state with fully entangled 4-qubits , 3-qubit entanglement describes a product - state of one qubit with fully entangled 3-qubits , and 2-qubit entanglement can be a product of two 2-qubit entangled states or a 2-qubit entangled state as product with two single qubits . + before applying these inequalities to the spin - systems we discuss another useful measure .",
    "the original measure @xmath32 of a many qubit pure state @xmath33 was introduced by meyer and wallach @xcite .",
    "it was later shown by brennen @xcite that this kind of global entanglement can be written as @xmath34,\\ ] ] with @xmath35 , the density matrix reduced to a single qubit @xmath36 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there can be introduced the so - called i - concurrence @xcite which also is directly related to the reduced density matrix @xmath37 of a subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "this i - concurrence measures the entanglement between two subsystems @xmath8 and @xmath9 and can be written as @xmath38}\\ ] ] in the following we use the notation @xmath39 . + we find as first result that the global entanglement @xmath32 is directly related to the sum of the squares of the i - concurrences of the 1-qubit subsytems of a @xmath40 qubit state @xmath41      for the special case of 3-qubits one can introduce the so - called tangle @xmath42 @xcite which in a sense describes those contributions to the i - concurrences which are not described by 2-qubit concurrences @xcite @xmath43 we can sum these relations up @xmath44 and introduce this into the global entanglement",
    ". it is nicely seen that for 3 qubits this consists of the sum of squared 2-qubit concurrences plus the additional tangle : @xmath45 the total entanglement measure is the sum of different entanglement contributions .      these nice results for 3-qubits",
    "can not easily be extended to 4-qubits since there is no equivalent definition of the corresponding higher tangle . but to give an impression of the power of the description with a global measure one can look for special qubit states were there are effectively only 2-qubit concurrences .",
    "@xmath46 one easily finds that the i - concurrences are sums of 2-qubits concurrences and therefore the global entanglement can be written as @xmath47 again this indicates a good total measure of entanglement by the value of @xmath32 .",

    "+ as a first test we consider the generalised ghz state for 3 qubits written as @xmath55 with @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "it is well known that there are no 2-qubit concurrences so that the remaining i - concurrences @xmath57 mainly measure the tangle of the state which is of course parameter dependent and from our formula ( [ qconctau ] ) it can be seen that @xmath32 just measures this tangle : @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ bellvghz ] the results of the bell optimization are plotted as a function of @xmath48 .",

    "( [ vghz - tangle ] ) ) over a large parameter range .",
    "this fact is underlined with the fit of the results of the inequalities by the results of the i - concurrences resp . the tangle .",
    "we therfore conclude that our maximization procedure yields the correct information for the entanglement .",
    "( note however that the optimization procedure as with all search - algorithms may fail to find the appropriate maximum . )",
    "+ only for a small parameter range ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) the inequalities are not sufficient compared to the calculated tangle .",
    "these results show that at the boundaries of the parameter values the optimization of @xmath15 could have problems but over a large range of the parameter values the optimized @xmath15 gives a good measure of entanglement as the tangle itself although we have no direct proof of the equivalence of these two meassures . quite remarkable",
    "is here the fact that the optimiztion of @xmath17 ( notation : @xmath54 ) yields for the parameter values @xmath62 no sufficient criterion for entanglement . + the points ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) where the inequality ( [ max1 ] ) is not violated agree with the results derived by scarani and gisin @xcite .",
    "+ this successful description of the generalized ghz - states encourages us to describe the entanglement of more complex systems .",
    "as in reference @xcite already discussed , heisenberg spin sytems are good models for various experimental realizations of multi - qubit systems . here",
    "we look for a special chain of 3 qubits where the interaction between qubit 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 are given by a certain interaction constant while between 1 and 3 we have doubled the interaction .",
    "our main purpose is , however , to study the anisotropy effect of this hamiltonian given by @xmath65 with the anisotropy coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "the eigensystem of this hamiltonian is calculated in the computational basis .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates are given in table i.    .eigensystem of the 3-qubit hamiltonian [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     even more interesting are the entanglement characteristics fot the state @xmath67 .",
    "we will apply our reasoning also to this state although one can only give partially quantitative answers .",
    "first of all we note that the general form of the state given as @xmath68 is quite complicated but it reduces to a ghz state in the two limits @xmath69 and @xmath70 as well as @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 from this we can conclude that there must be besides the 2-qubit concurrences an additional 3- and/or 4-qubit entanglement .",
    "+ for the concurrences one finds : @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 are greater or equal than 0 for @xmath77 resp . @xmath78 .",
    "the exact analytic representation of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is only possible in the parameter ranges @xmath81 and @xmath82 : @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are equal to 0 .",
    "[ phi15-erg ] we have plotted the sum of the squares of the concurrences .",
    "we can see that the maximum is at @xmath86 .",
    "it drops for very large @xmath87 to 0 while for @xmath88 to infinity it levels to a finite value .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the total global entanglement is constantly 1 @xmath89 which means that there is no differentiation between the different qubit entanglements in this measure .",
    "again it is very remarkable that the mermin - klyshko optimized operator is describing the additional entanglement ( besides the 2-qubit concurrences ) and follows parallel to the curve @xmath90 .",
    "we therefore conclude in analogy to the 3-qubit case that @xmath91 measures the true 3- and 4-qubit entanglements for this state .",
    "this is the most interesting result of our paper , since here is a quantitative measure of @xmath92-qubit entanglement @xmath93 for a 4-qubit state , although we can not discriminate between 3- and 4-qubit entanglement .",
    "+ again if we look for the structure of @xmath91 we find that all polynomial contributions for the limits @xmath94 and @xmath95 come from products of @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the different qubits and that the weight of this contribution changes with the strength of the additional entanglement ( cp .",
    "table [ bellparameter ] ) .",
    "+ in a future paper the polynomial structure is investigated in detail .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the optimized mermin - klyshko operators can be used very effectively to describe the degree of entanglement in different clusters of heisenberg spins . in those cases where there is in the 3-qubit system besides the concurrences no additional entanglement ( i. e. the tangle @xmath98 ) the optimized @xmath15 operator perfectly describes the 2-qubit entanglement of the system as a function of the anisotropic parameter in the heisenberg cluster and it is more or less identical to the global entanglement measure resp .",
    "the sum of the squared concurrences , cp .",
    "( [ qconctau ] ) . in those cases",
    "where in addition to the 2-qubit concurrences there is a finite tangle @xmath99 , we find that this additional 3-qubit entanglement measured by @xmath99 is nearly perfect described by the optimized @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ erg - ps78 ] .",
    "+ we therefore test this result in a 4-qubit system and again we find two different cases .",
    "we discuss a special state @xmath100 where the sum of the 2-qubit concurrences is mainly proportional to the global entanglement measure and from this we find that the optimized @xmath91 operator follows this @xmath32 value . in the second eigenstate for the system @xmath67 where the global entanglement is just equal to 1 , independent of the parameters , we expect",
    "besides the 2-qubit concurrences an additional entanglement and this seems to be perfectly the case , especially when the expression @xmath101 is compared in its parameter dependence to the optimized @xmath91 , shown in fig .",
    "[ phi15-erg ] .",
    "our special interest is here that even at the minima of these functions , at the point @xmath102 , there is a small but finite higher entanglement which of course at the moment could not be interpreted as 3- or otherwise 4-qubit entanglement .",
    "+ it should be noted that the optimization procedure for the @xmath103 operators heavily depends on the starting values and therefore a procedure has to be used where a random choice for the starting values has to be done .",
    "another remark is , that this optimization yields much more than one minimum or maximum and therefore one should be careful with the interpretation of these parameters .",
    "but at least for the ghz - state with 4-qubits we have shown that these operators contain besides the usually used @xmath97 operators additional @xmath96 contributions @xcite . + further work is in preparation where a more extensive study of these @xmath103 operators will be presented .",
