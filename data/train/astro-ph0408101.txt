    "spectroscopy indicates that this fraction could be substantial ( van dokkum et al .",

    "furthermore , the stacked x - ray flux of undetected sources provides an additional constraint on the average instantaneous star formation rate . where needed we assume @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21kms@xmath22mpc@xmath22 .",

    ", we removed 2 sources because they have photometric redshifts @xmath35 , and three sources within @xmath36of the center of the cluster , to minimize effects of the diffuse cluster light .",
    "the final sample thus consists of 40 drgs .",
    "johnson et al .  ( 2003 ) selected point - sources in the ms105403 field using wavdetect with a rather conservative threshold ( giving @xmath37 spurious source over the entire field ) , and we first determined the overlap between drgs at @xmath3 and x - ray sources in the johnson et al .",

    "( object 30 in their catalog ) .",
    "next we examined the prevalence of x - ray sources fainter than the conservative limits imposed by johnson et al .",
    "the x - ray fluxes were determined using apertures of @xmath40 diameter , which contain @xmath41% of the flux for point - sources over our entire @xmath42 fires field . for each drg",
    "a local background was determined from the mean flux in 30 randomly placed apertures near the location of the drg .",
    "the locations of these apertures were constrained to be non - overlapping , at a distance of @xmath43 from the drg , and at least @xmath44 from point sources identified by johnson et al .",
    "in addition to galaxy 1100 we find one other object ( 313 ; @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ) with a significant ( @xmath47 ) x - ray flux .",

    "the sed of object 313 is very similar to the median , suggesting that the agn does not contribute significantly to the continuum flux .",
    "however , galaxy 1100 has much bluer optical - nir colors than the majority of drgs indicating that its active nucleus may effect the sed , in particular in the rest - frame ultra - violet .",
    "the @xmath48 limit of 5.3 counts ( after background subtraction ) corresponds to an x - ray flux of @xmath49  ( see below ) , and a k - corrected luminosity of @xmath50 in the rest - frame @xmath51kev band for the median @xmath52 of the drgs in our sample .",
    "we conclude that the fraction of agn with @xmath53among drgs is @xmath4% ( assuming poisson statistics ) .",
    "we note here that both _",
    "spectroscopically_-identified agns in the ms105403 field have dropped out of the drg sample after recalibration of their photometry ( see van dokkum et al .",
    "interestingly only one of the two ( object 1035 , with @xmath54 ; labeled in fig .",
    "1 ) is detected with chandra , suggesting that a multi - wavelength approach is necessary to accurately determine the agn fraction among red galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the low x - ray background allows very efficient stacking analyses of sources that individually are too faint to be detected ( e.g. , alexander et al .",
    "2003 ; brandt et al .  2001 ; malhotra et al .  2003 ;",
    "reddy & steidel 2004 ) .",
    "we averaged the 38 flux measurements of the undetected drgs , effectively increasing the exposure time to 2.8ms .",
    "we also averaged each of the 30 sets of background measurements .",
    "these 30 random stacks have the same properties ( background and point spread function ) as the red galaxy stack , and are used to assess the significance of the flux in the averaged red galaxy apertures .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "the average background and significance in each band was determined in the following way .",
    "each of the 30 sets of random apertures was averaged in the same way as the drg apertures , providing 30 independent measurements of the mean of 38 random apertures .",
    "the mean of these 30 measurements gives the background value , and their rms is used to calculate the significance of the mean detection .",
    "after background subtraction , the mean emission from drgs is 0.54 counts ( 3.2@xmath55 significance ) in the full band , 0.41 counts ( 3.4@xmath55 ) in the soft band , and 0.14 counts ( 1@xmath55 ) in the hard band .",
    "images of the average detections are shown in fig .",
    "[ stack.plot ] .",
    "a concern is that the mean flux is dominated by one or two luminous sources which are just below the detection threshold .",
    "figure [ fluxhist.plot ] shows the distribution of the x - ray fluxes of our undetected drg sample after background subtraction , as well as the average distribution of the 30 random samples .",
    "the drgs show a tail of positive fluctuations and a deficit of negative fluctuations , consistent with the hypothesis that most sources contribute to the mean detection .",
    "we empirically test how much flux is lost by our adopted @xmath40 apertures by repeating our measurements of the mean x - ray emission using differently sized apertures .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 . as expected , the flux is a function of aperture size .",
    "based on the values in table 1 and the acis documentation we estimate that the @xmath40 apertures miss @xmath56% of the flux at the average location of the drgs ( @xmath57 from the optical axis ) . this aperture effect is partially countered by weak lensing of the background drgs by the foreground @xmath18 cluster .",
    "this effect is @xmath58% on average ( see frster schreiber et al .",
    "the aperture- and lensing - corrected mean flux of the drgs is @xmath59 ( random ) @xmath60 ( systematic ) counts in the full band .",
    "the systematic error reflects the uncertainties in the two corrections .",
    "the average x - ray detection of the drgs provides a constraint on their instantaneous star formation rate . in general , x - ray emission of galaxies is due to a combination of hot gas ( e.g. , from supernova bubbles and winds ) , low mass x - ray binaries , high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , and possibly an active nucleus .",
    "hmxbs are short - lived as they trace the prompt formation rate of massive stars with @xmath61 , and it appears that for galaxies with star formation rates in excess of @xmath62  they dominate the x - ray luminosity , particularly above 2kev ( grimm et al .",
    "several recent studies have therefore explored the relation between the instantaneous star formation rate and the rest - frame 210kev x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , ranalli et al .",
    "2003 , grimm et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    "we use the grimm et al.(2003 ) relation , sfr@xmath63 .",
    "the grimm et al .",
    "calibration gives @xmath64% lower star formation rates than the ranalli et al .",
    "calibration .",
    "we convert the observed counts in the @xmath6kev energy band to a rest - frame @xmath51kev luminosity in the following way .",
    "first we determined the average conversion from counts to flux from the sources listed in johnson et al .",
    "the conversion varies by less than 10% over the acis field .",
    "their conversion assumes a spectrum with photon index @xmath65 , and we use the portable interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms ) to calculate the effect of changing @xmath66 from 1.7 to 2.0 , which is the appropriate value for the @xmath67kev spectrum of hmxbs . applying this @xmath58% correction to the empirically determined conversion factor we obtain @xmath68 , with @xmath69 in units of @xmath70 .",
    "the lensing- and aperture - corrected mean drg flux is then @xmath71 in the 0.58kev band .",
    "next , the flux is k - corrected to the rest - frame 210kev band ( again assuming @xmath72 ) , using @xmath73 . converting the rest - frame flux to a rest - frame luminosity ( for @xmath73 ) we find @xmath74 , and the grimm et al .  ( 2003 ) calibration gives an instantaneous star formation rate of @xmath11 ( random ) @xmath12 ( systematic ) .",
    "the systematic error is due to uncertainties in the aperture- and lensing correction , uncertainties in the conversion of x - ray luminosity to star formation rate , and the scatter in the relation between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate .",
    "it was assumed that these uncertainties can be added in quadrature .",
    "we note that pimms predicts a @xmath75 ratio for the soft vs.hard band counts , consistent with our non - detection in the hard band .",
    "our estimate of the star formation rate in drgs based on x - ray emission can be compared to previous estimates based on sed fitting and emission lines ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "the main uncertainty in the sed fits is the assumed star formation history .",
    "frster schreiber et al .  ( 2004a ) find a median ( mean ) instantaneous star formation rate of @xmath76 ( 190 )  for drgs with @xmath77 in the ms105403 field assuming continuous star formation models , and only 23 ( 69 )  for declining models with @xmath78myr . as shown in van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2004 ) the inclusion of h@xmath79 measurements does not break the degeneracy between star formation history , dust , and instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "our result is in excellent agreement with the high star formation rates derived from continuous ( dusty ) models , and may imply that drgs contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate at @xmath13 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the mean x - ray luminosity of drgs with that of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "reddy & steidel ( 2004 ) find a mean x - ray flux of @xmath80  in the @xmath8kev band and an implied sfr of @xmath81  for lbgs at @xmath82 in the chandra deep field north . as the redshift range of these lbgs and",
    "our drgs is roughly similar we can compare the fluxes directly , limiting systematic uncertainties .",
    "the mean flux of the drgs is @xmath83 in the @xmath8kev band , a factor @xmath62 higher than that of lbgs .",
    "the interpretation is unclear , as the two samples have not been matched in observed @xmath84 magnitude , their luminosity functions may be different , and the space density of drgs is still uncertain .",
    "our estimate does not include one significant systematic uncertainty , likely to be present in most attempts to infer high redshift star formation rates from x - ray luminosities .",
    "for nearby galaxies the angular resolution of chandra can be used to subtract out the possible contamination from a central active nucleus , but this is not possible for high redshift objects .",
    "all the x - ray luminosity attributed to hmxbs could in fact come from a population of low luminosity agn . since we do not have optical spectra for most of our obects and we do not have the x - ray counts and count rates to impose constraints based on x - ray spectral and variability information",
    ", we can not directly rule this possibility out .    as a general caution ,",
    "we remark that even if we did have optical spectra , it might be quite difficult to rule out the presence of a low luminosity agn .",
    "if we assume that the relation between the mass of a galaxy bulge and the mass of the bulge s central black hole ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .  2000 ) is already established for these objects , then",
    "the red galaxies in our sample have typical black hole masses @xmath85 the mean x - ray luminosity of @xmath86  is a factor @xmath87 below the typical x - ray luminosity for unobscured agn with similar black hole masses , i.e. , the nuclei of these galaxies are heavily obscured or the possible black holes in these galaxes are accreting at low , sub - eddington rates . in either case , if one does not have the angular resolution to separate out the nucleus , the starlight from the bulge can completely dominate the agn light ( e.g. , moran et al .",
    "the lack of obvious agn features in a spectrum is thus not conclusive evidence against an agn contribution if the aperture used contains most of the galaxy and the signal to noise ratio of the spectrum is low .",
    "a better ( but still circumstantial ) argument that the x - ray luminosity represents star formation might instead be the concordance of several independent star formation indicators , e.g. , between the radio , de - reddened uv , and x - ray in reddy & steidel ( 2004 ) .",
    "further independent constraints on the star formation rate in drgs are thus urgently needed .",
    "studies of larger samples will provide a better measurements of the number of _ luminous _ agns : whereas our initial spectroscopy indicates agn fractions of @xmath88% ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) the chandra data suggest that this is largely due to the strong spectroscopic selection bias toward galaxies with bright emission lines .",
    "it is also important to directly assess the effect of agns on the broad - band seds ( and hence estimates of star formation rates , ages , and dust content ) .",
    "planned observations with nicmos and acs on hst of ms105403 will provide constraints on the point - source contribution to the continuum from the rest - frame uv to the optical .",
    "finally , deeper x - ray observations are needed to further constrain the hardness ratio of the mean detection and to detect more individual x - ray sources ; our results and those of barger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that in 12ms exposures many of the @xmath0 red galaxies may be ( faint ) chandra sources ."
