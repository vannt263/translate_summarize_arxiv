    "the origin of supersonic jets from young stellar objects ( ysos ) remains unclear .",
    "the current consensus holds that magnetic fields tied to either an accretion disk or the star - disk boundary can launch _ and _ collimate material into a jet .",
    "these  magneto - centrifugal \" scenarios have been explored analytically in a variety of configurations including the popular disk - wind ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and x - wind ( @xcite ) models .",
    "numerical simulations of magneto - centrifugal mechanisms have shown mixed but promising results .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that disk wind models can produce well collimated jets when the feed - back on the disk is ignored . @xcite",
    "have shown that magneto - centrifugal mechanisms can launch winds ; however , in their simulations the winds do not collimate into jets .",
    "the potential difficulties involved in turning magneto - centrifugal winds into jets have been noted before .",
    "@xcite discussed the slow ( logarithmic ) rate at which mhd models produce collimation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that x - wind models will tend to produce wide - angle winds rather than discrete cylindrical jets .",
    "along with these issues , recent numerical studies have shown that pure hydrodynamic collimation can be surprisingly effective at producing well collimated supersonic jets .",
    "frank & mellema ( 1996 , 1997 ) and mellema & frank ( 1997 ) have demonstrated that isotropic or wide angle yso winds interacting with toroidal density environments readily produce oblique inward facing wind - shocks .",
    "these shocks can be effective at redirecting the wind material into a jet .",
    "if the wind from the central source is varying , this `` shock focusing '' mechanism can , in principle , produce jets on the observed physical scales ( mellema & frank 1997 ) .",
    "similar mechanisms have been shown to work in other jet - producing contexts as well ( peter & eichler 1996 ; frank , balick & livio 1996 ; borkowski , blondin & harrington 1997 ) .",
    "the variety of available collimation models begs the question of which process actually produces protostellar jets .",
    "observations that can distinguish signatures of different theoretical models are obviously needed . unfortunately seeing into the collimation region",
    "is difficult .",
    "a number of studies indicate that collimation occurs on scales of order @xmath4 ( burrows 1996 ; ray 1996 ) , at or below current observational limits .",
    "in addition the many magnitudes of extinction common for star forming systems often obscure the innermost region where jets form",
    ". thus critical observations concerning the formation of the jets will have to come from downstream of the collimation regions ; i.e. from the jets themselves .    if the collimation process is mhd dominated , then magnetic fields will remain embedded in the jets as they propagate . in particular both disk - wind and x - wind models of jet collimation will produce jets with strong toroidal fields .",
    "this is evidenced by the fact that while the sonic mach numbers of the jets may be high ( @xmath5 ) the fast mode mach numbers will be low ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) .",
    "direct observation of magnetic fields in protostellar jets would help clarify issues surrounding jet origins .",
    "unfortunately such measurements have generally proven to be difficult to obtain ( ray 1997 ) .",
    "a promising alternative is look for less direct tracers of strong fields in yso jets .",
    "if jets are produced via mhd processes , dynamically significant magnetic stresses should affect the beam and jet head as they interact with the environment .",
    "thus the propagation characteristics of protostellar jets may hold important clues to their origins .    in this letter we present the first results of a campaign of radiative mhd simulations of yso jets .",
    "the goal of our ongoing study is to search for observable characteristics that distinguish hydrodynamic from magnetohydrodynamic jets .",
    "here we present models that articulate significant radiative mhd effects while also making contact with the extensive bibliography of previous numerical jet studies .",
    "radiative mhd jets are the next logical step in the explication of astrophysical jet dynamics .",
    "we have deliberately used simplified initial conditions in our simulations .",
    "our initial set - up , similar to those used past studies , demonstrates new features introduced by the interaction of radiative losses and magnetic stresses in the context of those aspects of jet physics that are well understood .",
    "beginning with the work of norman and collaborators the behavior of axisymmetric jets ( @xmath0-d ) without radiative losses has been successfully cataloged and explained ( norman 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the dynamics of the _ bow shock _",
    "( which accelerates ambient material ) , _ jet shock _ ( which decelerates material in the jet beam ) , and _ cocoon _ ( decelerated jet gas surrounding the beam ) have been well - studied in these simulations .",
    "one should note that these investigations have tended to focus on so called `` light '' extra - galactic jets where the density of the material in the jet beam ( @xmath7 ) is lower than that in the ambient medium ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the jets emanating from ysos are , however , thought to be `` heavy '' in the sense that the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "another fundamental difference between extra - galactic and yso jets is the presence in the latter of strong post - shock emission from collisionally excited atomic and molecular lines .",
    "thus , while extra - galactic jets can be considered `` adiabatic '' , yso jets must be considered `` radiative '' . beginning with the work of blondin , knigl & fryxell ( 1990 )",
    "the dynamics of radiative jets has been explored in considerable detail ( stone & norman 1994 ; raga 1994 ; suttner  1997 ) .",
    "these simulations all show that as pressure support is lost , the bow shock / jet shock pair collapse into a thin shell . they also revealed dynamical and thermal instabilities associated with this shell .",
    "mhd simulations of non - radiative jets were first carried out by clarke , norman & burns 1986 using a strong , purely toroidal magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "their results showed that `` hoop '' stresses associated with the radially directed tension force inhibit sideways motion of shocked jet gas .",
    "material that would have spilled into the cocoon is forced into the region between the jet and bow shock , forming a `` nose - cone '' of magnetically dominated low @xmath11 gas ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "hoop stresses also collapse the beam near the nozzle , producing strong internal shocks .",
    "lind ( 1989 ) performed similar calculations , initializing their simulations with a jet in hydromagnetic equilibrium and presenting a more complete exploration of parameter space .",
    "they confirmed that nose - cones form in jets with low initial @xmath11 .",
    "kssl , mller & hillebrandt ( 1990ab ) explored mhd jets with a variety of initial field configurations ( poloidal , toroidal , and helical ) .",
    "cases with significant toroidal fields always developed nose - cones .",
    "cases with poloidal fields developed loops with field reversals in the cocoon susceptible to tearing mode instabilities and reconnection .",
    "we note studies of mhd instabilities in _ just _ the jet beam have also been carried out ( hardee , clarke & rosen 1997 )    mhd simulations of heavy yso jets have been carried out by todo 1992 .",
    "these models did _ not _ include radiative losses .",
    "their jets showed similar forms to those simulated by kssl mller & hillebrandt 1990a , but todo 1992 also were able to identify the presence of both slow and fast mode shocks in the jet and to present a more quantitative analysis of stability issues .",
    "very recently , cerqueira 1997 , in a study parallel to ours , have reported the first 3-d simulations of radiative mhd jets using an sph code .",
    "those simulations show results that are similar to what we present below .",
    "our work and that of cerqueira are complimentary in that very different methods are used .",
    "their study was carried out in 3-d , while ours is @xmath13-d at this point .",
    "however , our grid - based axisymmetric simulations have a factor 10 higher resolution . especially in radiatively unstable structures ,",
    "high numerical resolution is important to capture the dynamics properly .",
    "our simulations evolve the equations of ideal mhd in cylindrically symmetric coordinates ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "since all three components of vector fields are accounted for the model is @xmath0-d .",
    "the mhd code used is based on the mhd version of the total variation diminishing method .",
    "it is an extension of the second - order finite - difference , upwinded , conservative scheme , originally developed by harten ( 1983 ) .",
    "the mhd code is described in @xcite ( 1-d version ) , @xcite ( multidimensional cartesian version ) , and @xcite ( multidimensional cylindrical version ) .",
    "the code contains routines that maintain the @xmath15 condition at each time step .",
    "however , since the simulations described actually contain only the toroidal component of magnetic field in @xmath0-d , @xmath15 is trivially satisfied although @xmath15 is not enforced in the code .",
    "cooling is calculated from look - up tables for a coronal cooling curve @xmath16 taken from @xcite .",
    "full ionization is assumed and the cooling is applied in between hydro time - steps via an integration of the thermal energy @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "tests show the method can recover steady state radiative shocks to within @xmath18 accuracy when the cooling region is resolved .",
    "a  floor \" on the temperature is set at @xmath19 .",
    "the code has been extensively tested in 1.5 dimensions ( franklin , noriega - crespo & frank 1997 ) with and without cooling and against uchida et al . simulations ( 1992 ) with satisfactory results .",
    "we have performed simulations that compare the evolution of 4 cases : a non - radiative weak field jet ; a non - radiative strong field jet ; a radiative weak field jet ; a radiative strong field jet . since the first three cases have been studied before , our goal was to confirm that the code recovers features seen in previous investigations available in the literature and to extend the sequence into the radiative , strong - field regime .    in each simulation",
    "the jet was driven into the computational domain ( @xmath20 ) as a fully collimated supersonic / super - fast mode beam @xmath21 .",
    "the properties of the jet common to all the simulations were as follows ( @xmath22=jet , @xmath23=ambient medium ) : @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; @xmath27 .",
    "the initial gas pressure in the jet @xmath28 , and hence @xmath29 are varied radially to obtain hydromagnetic equilibrium .",
    "thus the sonic mach number @xmath30 must be defined as a radial average of @xmath31 . in all our simulations",
    "@xmath32 the computational domain spanned @xmath33 with a jet radius @xmath34 or 30 grid cells .    in all the simulations a magnetic field",
    "was imposed in the _",
    "jet only_. the field was purely toroidal . this simplification can be justified on theoretical grounds ( camenzind 1997 ; @xcite ) , since most disk - wind models rely on a dominant toroidal field to produce tightly collimated jets .",
    "hydromagnetic equilibrium between gas and magnetic pressure in the jet was imposed as an initial condition ( priest 1983 , begelman 1997 ) after choosing a form for @xmath35 the equilibrium condition is solved for the initial radial gas pressure distribution @xmath36 . in our simulations",
    "we used the same @xmath35 and @xmath36 as lind ( 1989 ) .",
    "as with the sonic mach number the alfveic mach number @xmath37 for the jet is a radial average of @xmath38 .",
    "the fast mode , sonic and alfvenic mach numbers are related by @xmath39 . for our strong field simulations the average initial value of the field is @xmath40 @xmath41 and an average plasma beta @xmath42 . it should be noted that this configuration , known as a z - pinch in the plasma physics community , is almost always unstable to both pinch and kink modes . since our simulations",
    "are axisymmetric we are unable to track kink modes ( but , see cerqueira 1997 ; todo 1993 ) .",
    "the pinch modes are quite important , however , and , as begelman 1997 has shown , the beam will be unstable to these instabilities when @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the lind 1989 initial configurations .",
    "we note that since these simulations include radiative cooling @xmath45 quickly flattens out as the jet propagates .",
    "we first present an equation to estimate the speed of the jet head , @xmath46 ( the bow shock ) that accounts for magnetic ( and gas ) pressure effects .",
    "we define @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is effective jet head radius over which the ram pressure , @xmath50 is applied .",
    "> from 1-d momentum balance , ignoring the ambient pressure , we find @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the familiar expression for the speed of a `` cold '' , pressure - less jet ( dal pino & benz 1993 ) , and the remaining terms describe an  enhancement factor \" for the head speed due to finite jet pressure .",
    "this factor in equation [ bige ] is _ always greater than or equal to unity _ , as we should expect . for the limiting case @xmath53 equation [ bige ]",
    "gives @xmath54 . in fig 1 and 2",
    "we present the results of our simulations with @xmath55 .",
    "we will use equation 4.1 to interpret the results presented below .",
    "* a ) non - radiative weak field jet * : here the magnetic field is set quite low so that alfvnic mach number is @xmath56 .",
    "fig 1 shows clearly the well - known bow shock / jet shock configuration at the head of the jet ( norman 1993 ) .",
    "the scale of the bow shock is relatively large because of the post - shock thermal pressure .",
    "note however that the speed of the jet ( @xmath57 ) is relatively low compared with extragalactic jets .",
    "thus the post _ jet _ shock temperature in this simulation is low ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the pressure in the cocoon is therefore also small compared with extragalatic jet simulations and only weak internal waves are forced into the the jet beam .",
    "blondin , fryxell & knigl 1990 found a similar result in their comparisons of non - radiative and radiative yso jet simulations .    *",
    "b ) non - radiative strong field jet * : here a stronger field is used so that the alfvnic mach number is @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) . in this simulation",
    "the structure of the jet head has changed dramatically due to dynamical influences of the field .",
    "note the large separation of the jet and bow shocks . as has been described in other mhd jet studies ( clarke 1986 ; lind 1989 ; kssl 1990ab ) such `` nose - cone '' structures occur because of the pinching effect of the magnetic hoop stresses .",
    "post jet - shock material , which would otherwise back flow into the cocoon , is forced to remain between the two shocks .",
    "the bow shock is accelerated forward producing higher propagation speeds ( note the times at which the images where taken ) . in previous studies",
    "the acceleration was attributed to the magnetic pressure in the nose cone ( kssl 1990b ) .",
    "we demonstrate below that the increased speed can be better attributed in this case to a cross section effect produced by magnetic pinch forces .",
    "note the strong convergence occurring just beyond the jet nozzle and the reflected shocks in the beam downstream .",
    "this occurs due to the pinch instability described in section 3 and has been seen in all mhd jet simulations with strong toroidal fields .",
    "we note also that these results look quite similar to the those presented by kssl 1990b ( see their figure 10a ) .",
    "* c ) radiative weak field jet * : the magnetic field in this case is the same as case a. again the standard bow shock / jet shock configuration is apparent .",
    "maps of temperature show that the post - bow / jet shock region is nearly isothermal .",
    "the loss of post - shock thermal energy reduces the transverse width of the bow shock . densities behind the shocks become high with compression ratios of @xmath61 ( compared to the value @xmath62 obtained in the non - radiative case ) .",
    "animations of this model show that the structure at the jet head is highly time - dependent with the region between the two shocks becoming quite thin at times . at late times in the simulation",
    "the jet head undergoes the non - linear thin shell instability ( vishniac 1994 ) , which also has been observed in other radiative jet simulations ( blondin , fryxell & knigl 1990 ; stone & norman 1994 ) .",
    "note again the lack of structure in the jet beam . in both cases",
    "a ) and c ) the jet heads propagate at a velocity @xmath63 km which compares well with @xmath64 predicted by equation [ bige ] for a cold jet ( @xmath65 ) with @xmath66 .    *",
    "d ) radiative strong field jet * : in this simulation the field is the same as for the non - radiative , strong field jet ( case b ) and the structure of the jet head is similar to what obtains in that simulation .",
    "a narrow bow shock appears some distance ahead of a high density region associated with the jet shock .",
    "note that the loss of thermal energy behind the shocks has reduced the scale of the bow shock @xmath49 compared with its non - radiative twin .",
    "fig 2 shows the evolution of this simulation at five different times .    for this case the initial collapse of the beam just beyond the nozzle produces a series of strong shocks and reflections in the jet as it propagates down the length of the grid .",
    "fig 2 shows the periodic density enhancements in the beam formed from these reflections .",
    "if such features are not a consequence of the imposed axi - symmetry they may have important consequences for the emission characteristics of real yso jets .",
    "figs 1 and 2 show that a jet shock forms close to the bow shock .",
    "the reduced width of the jet shock / bow shock pair is similar to what is seen in the evolution of the weak field radiative jet ( blondin , fryxell & knigl 1990 ) .",
    "the most important conclusion to be reached from these simulations comes from comparison of the third and fourth panels of fig 1 .",
    "for radiative jets , the weak and strong field cases look dramatically different from each other in terms of the morphology of the jet head and beam . in the weak field case",
    "there are no shocks in the beam .",
    "the strong field case shows multiple shock reflections ( fig 2 ) .",
    "the head of the weak field jet is quite `` blunt '' compared with the strongly tapered strong field jet .",
    "the average propagation speed for the head of the strong field jet is @xmath67 , a 30% increase over the weak field case , even though both simulations have the same jet / ambient density ratio , @xmath68 .",
    "the combination of higher shock speeds and strong pinch forces in the radiative strong field jet produces a compression ratio in the head almost twice as large as in the radiative weak field case .",
    "if these results are born out in more detailed studies , particularly those in 3-d , then indirect diagnostics of the presence of dynamically strong fields in jets should exist .",
    "as noted , the increased speed of mhd jet heads has sometimes been attributed to magnetic pressure in the nose - cone .",
    "equation [ bige ] , however , demonstrates that the increased momentum provided by finite pressure alone can not account for the enhanced head speed in the mhd cases we have simulated . using @xmath55 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 appropriate to our simulations",
    ", this relation gives @xmath71 , assuming the same head - scale factor @xmath72 that was used successfully to estimate the jet head speeds for our non - mhd simulations .",
    "in fact , the finite pressures nominally add only about 2% to the jet head speeds according to equation [ bige ] . on the other hand",
    ", it is apparent that the tapered shape of the nose cone formed by magnetic hoop stresses has streamlined the flow around the jet head .",
    "that effectively increases the geometry factor , @xmath73 , which can significantly enhance the jet head speed , @xmath46 . from the simulation data we estimate in case d that the radius of the jet head is @xmath74 , leading to @xmath75 .",
    "inserting this into equation [ bige ] gives a jet head speed of @xmath76 , closer to the @xmath77 estimated from the simulation itself .",
    "the results of these simulations demonstrate that propagation - based diagnostics for radiative mhd jets may exist .",
    "the strong effect of magnetic pinches in these axisymmetric calculations change both the structure of the jet head and the beam .",
    "the increased velocity of the bow shock is also a distinctive feature of mhd jets .",
    "these morphological and kinematic characteristics would alter the observed emission properties in a real yso jet .",
    "the strong shocks in the beam would produce increased excitation of both atomic and molecular lines .",
    "the increased speed of the jet head will alter both the degree of ionization and excitation .",
    "this study is too preliminary , however , to provide observers with a definitive accounting of the differences between real radiative hydrodynamic and mhd jets .",
    "we leave this task to future studies ( frank 1998 ) .",
    "the most obvious deficit in our models is the imposed axisymmetry .",
    "cerqueira 1997 have recently reported 3-d sph calculations which also show that strong toroidal field components dramatically alter the morphology of the jets , consistent with our results .",
    "their numerical resolution was too low , however , to see the detailed structure of shocks in both the beam and the jet head , which are both clearly captured in our simulations .",
    "since these kinds of structures are not seen in observations , cerqueira 1997 ( who did observe the narrowing of the jet head due to pinch forces ) concluded that real yso jets can not have significant toroidal fields .",
    "if future high resolution grid - based and sph based codes continue to find such effects , that may pose a serious challenge to mhd jet models that rely on collimation via hoop stresses .",
    "it is also worth noting the role of reconnection .",
    "the initial conditions used in our models do not allow for field reversals to occur . if a poloidal ( @xmath78 ) component exists , then field lines embedded in the beam will be decelerated upon passage through the jet shock .",
    "if the fields and cooling are not strong enough to inhibit the formation of a cocoon , these lines will be carried backwards forming field reversals ( frank 1997 ; kssl , mller & hillebrandt 1990b ) .",
    "such a topology is unstable to resistive tearing mode instabilities and magnetic reconnection .",
    "the presence of reconnection in jets could have important consequences for the interpretation of shock emission diagnostics ( hartigan , morse & raymond 1993 ) .",
    "reconnection would provide an alternate means for converting kinetic energy into a thermal energy ( the field acts as a catalyst , jones 1997 ) which is then channeled into collisionally excited emission .",
