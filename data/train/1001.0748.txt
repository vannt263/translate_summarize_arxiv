    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of permalloy ( the magnetic material commonly used to fabricate artificial spin ice ) is effectively zero , so that the shape anisotropy of each island forces its magnetic moment to align along the largest axis , making the islands effectively ising - like .",

    "down : configurations of the spins obeying the ice rule in a tetrahedron in the artificial ( left ) and the natural ( right ) spin ices .",
    "this small distortion of the spins configuration causes a residual ordering and consequently , an outstanding energetic string connects the monopoles in the modified artificial system.,width=264 ]    in a previous work @xcite we have pointed out that monopoles do not appear as effective low - energy degrees of freedom in two - dimensional square spin ices , as they do in the three - dimensional materials @xmath12 . due to the antiferromagnetic order in the ground - state , the constituents of a pair monopole - antimonopole",
    "become confined by a string which forbids them to move independently .",
    "however , we have also argued that above a critical temperature , the string configurational entropy may lose its tension leaving the monopoles free .",
    "the quantitative analysis of such a possible phase transition is under current investigation@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , other strategies to find monopoles in synthetic spin ices have been proposed .",
    "mller and moessner @xcite have suggested a modification of the square lattice geometry in which they argue that , considering a special condition , the string tension vanishes at any temperature .",
    "this modification in the system produced by wang _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite consists of introducing a height offset @xmath0 between islands pointing along the two different directions @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ modifiedsystem ] ; such a system is currently under experimental planning@xcite ) .",
    "their idea comprises basically the following : if @xmath0 is chosen so that the energies of all vertices obeying ice rule become degenerate , then , an ice regime is established leaving the monopoles `` free '' to move ( indeed , there is a coulombic interaction between the monopoles)@xcite . for point - like",
    "dipoles they considered that a degenerate state is obtained when the interactions between nearest - neighbors ( @xmath13 ) and next - nearest - neighbors ( @xmath14 ) are equal , leading to the following value for the height offset where `` free '' monopoles occur : @xmath15 ( where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing)@xcite .",
    "taking into account the finite extension of the dipoles , the height offset diminishes and as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the length of the island ) , the endpoints of the islands form a tetrahedron , so that at @xmath18 the ordering disappears , and the monopoles become free to move@xcite .    here",
    "we numerically calculate the energetics of the ground - states and excitations in the modified square lattice as a function of @xmath0 . in our calculations",
    "we consider point - like dipoles forming the lattice .",
    "although the main physical aspects of the system must be correct with this approximation , some parameter values ( such as magnetic charge , string tension , critical height etc ) should be quantitatively altered for the realistic case in which @xmath17 has a finite length .",
    "on the other hand , since we take into account all the long - range dipole - dipole interactions , it is expected that our results could better describe the actual system .",
    "for instance , while in the calculations of refs .  , the ground - state changes its configuration at @xmath19 , our results indicate that it occurs at @xmath20 .",
    "besides , we noted that at least one of the several configurations that satisfy the ice rule does not have the same energy of the `` ground - states '' ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) at this very height , indicating that for @xmath6 the system is not in a completely degenerate state .",
    "we have also shown that the string tension decreases rapidly as @xmath0 increases but it does not vanish at any value ( @xmath23 ) : rather , at @xmath6 , its strength reads about 20 times smaller than that of the usual case for @xmath5 . a possible cause of the finite strength of the string tension even at @xmath24 is the fact that , concerning the spin configurations in a tetrahedron , the artificial spin ice has a slight difference with its natural counterpart .",
    "for the artificial compounds proposed in ref .  , the localized magnetic moments forming a corner - sharing tetrahedral lattice are forced to point along the longest axis of the islands ( here , @xmath25- or @xmath26-directions , see fig.[vertices ] ) while in the original @xmath27 spin ices , they point along a @xmath28 axis ( indeed , in this case , the magnetic dipoles point along axes that meet at the centers of tetrahedra ) . as a result of this mismatch",
    ", there is always a single ordered ground state in the artificial systems , which is responsible for the residual value of the string tension and its anisotropy .",
    "another interesting result obtained here with the point - like dipole approximation is that the magnetic charge of the monopoles jumps as the system undergoes a transition in its ground state .",
    "in addition , in general , this strength of the interaction between a monopole and its antimonopole is anisotropic , depending on the lattice direction and on the type of order .",
    "however , as expected from the above discussions , we note that the system anisotropy diminishes as @xmath0 goes to @xmath24 .",
    "actually , as @xmath0 increases from zero , the differences found in the values of the  charges \" ( as distinct directions for the monopoles separation are taken into account ) decreases , and they tend to disappear as @xmath29 , i.e. , in the ice regime ( nevertheless , @xmath30 is not really an optimal ice regime , at least for point - like dipoles ) .",
    "we model the system suggested in refs .   assuming : the magnetic moment (  spin \" ) of the island is replaced by a point dipole at its center . at each site @xmath31 of a `` square '' lattice",
    "two spin variables are defined : @xmath10 with components @xmath32 , @xmath33 located at @xmath34 , and @xmath11 with components @xmath35 , @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",

    "we observed exactly the same behavior for obc and pbc and the size dependence of the results is not appreciable . by using a simulating annealing process ( see ref .  ) , the first thing to notice is that the ground - state configuration changes for a critical value of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstates ] ( a ) , for all values @xmath46 , the system ground - state ( hereafter referred to as @xmath21 )   has exactly the same form as that of the usual case in which @xmath5 .",
    "however , for @xmath51 , the ground - state changes to @xmath22 ( see fig .  [ groundstates ] ( b ) ) . really , as @xmath52 , the energies of both states are comparable , whereas for @xmath51 the state @xmath22 is less energetic ( see fig .  [ groundstatesenergy ] ) .",
    "such a result is in qualitative agreement with findings of ref .  , which presents the transition at @xmath53 .",
    "as expected , both configurations obey the ice rule ( two spins point in and two point out in every vertex ) , but while in @xmath54 the magnetization is zero at each vertex , in @xmath47 it points diagonally , but with net vanishing magnetization . as shown in fig .",
    "[ groundstatesenergy ] , the energy of @xmath21 increases rapidly as @xmath0 increases while the energy of @xmath22 is constant .",
    "actually , for this latter configuration , the horizontal and vertical sub - lattices are decoupled .",
    "we note that these two ground - states are metastable in the sense that they are local minima and can not be continuously deformed one into another without spending a considerable amount of energy ; trying to align the dipoles from one state to another costs the inversion of two spins by vertex ( half of the spins have to be inverted in the whole system ) .",
    "this changing has an @xmath0-dependent energy barrier which is roughly of the order of @xmath55 ( for @xmath56 and @xmath49 ) , making this process much improbable to occur spontaneously .",

    "we choose four different ways they may be separated ( see fig .  [ cena10 ] ) .",
    "firstly , using the string shape @xmath58 and starting in the ground - state @xmath54 ( for @xmath46 ) we choose an arbitrary site and then the spins marked in dark gray in fig .",
    "[ cena10 ] are flipped , creating a monopole - antimonopole separated by @xmath66 .",
    "next , the spins marked in light gray are flipped and the separation distance becomes @xmath67 , and so on . in this case , the string length ( @xmath68 ) is related to the charges separation distance @xmath69 by @xmath70 ( the monopole and the antimonopole will be found along the same horizontal or vertical line ) .",
    "secondly , we also consider a string - path of form @xmath59 ( for @xmath61 ) , making the separated monopoles to be found in different lines ( diagonally positioned ; now we have @xmath71 ) .",
    "more two equivalent ways were studied for @xmath51 in which @xmath22 is the ground - state . in this case , however , differently from the situation in the @xmath54 state , now the monopoles can be separated by using a linear string - path ( so that @xmath72 ) without any violation of the ice rule .",
    "finally , another monopoles separation studied for @xmath47 is the  diagonal - path \" ( or path 3 ) , in which the charges are put in different lines .",
    "our analysis shows that besides the coulombic - type term @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the a coupling constant which gives the strength of the interaction ) , the total energy cost of a monopole - antimonopole pair has an extra contribution behaving like @xmath75 , brought about by the string - like excitation that binds the monopoles , say , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a @xmath0-depended constant related to the monopole pair creation ( for instance , for @xmath5 @xmath78d and @xmath79d ) .",
    "the results for the `` charge '' @xmath80 are shown in figure [ coulomb ] for the range @xmath81 . when @xmath61 , the excitations are considered above @xmath21 , and we observe that there is a small h - dependent difference in the @xmath60-value for paths @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which vanishes as @xmath82 . at higher heights , @xmath51 , @xmath60 is valued with respect to @xmath22 , and is @xmath0-independent for a linear string - path . however , for path 3 , it comes back to increase as @xmath0 increases .",
    "therefore , the interaction of a monopole with its partner ( antimonopole ) is anisotropic in artificial spin ices .",
    "perhaps , it would be more appropriate to redefine things in such a way that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and the actual value of the charges @xmath85 is independent of the angle @xmath86 that the line connecting the poles makes with the @xmath25-axis . in this case , the anisotropy of the interaction ( coming from the background ) is implicitly considered in the function @xmath87 but its complete expression was not evaluated here . since @xmath88 tends to be a constant ( independent of @xmath86 , we set @xmath89 and so , only around the ice regime ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) , the interaction tends to be isotropic .",
    "thus we can find the genuine strength of the magnetic charge in this artificial compound as being @xmath91 , where we have used @xmath92 .",
    "just for effect of comparison , using some parameters of ref .",
    "such as @xmath93 , we get a charge value which is about @xmath94 times larger than the typical value found for the original @xmath27 spin ices @xcite ( or about 100 times smaller than the dirac fundamental charge ) .",
    "besides its anisotropy , another interesting fact about the coulombic interaction in the artificial compounds is that it jumps at @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , at this point , @xmath60 abruptly changes from @xmath95 to @xmath96 when the linear path is taken into account .",
    "such a discontinuity may be attributed to the ground - state transition and that above @xmath22 the coulombic interaction between a pair somewhat incorporates the residual magnetization stored in each vertex .",
    "on the other hand , keeping a diagonal separation of the monopoles along the ground state transition , the magnetic charge parameter @xmath60 increases almost continuously .",
    "( color online ) the string tension for the two string shapes shown in fig.[cena10 ] for @xmath61 and for a linear string - path and path 3 ( diagonal ) for @xmath51 .",
    "the green dot and the dashed lines represents an extrapolation of our data.,width=188 ]    how the string tension @xmath97 depends upon @xmath0 is shown in fig.[tension ] . note that , while @xmath21 is the ground - state ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath97 diminishes as @xmath0 increases . at higher heights , and being evaluated over @xmath22 , the tension remains a non - vanishing small constant for linear path and turns back to increase for diagonal separation ( path 3 ) . in general , since @xmath97 is also a function of @xmath86 ( i.e.,@xmath98 ) , it is more favorable energetically that a pole and its antipole reside at the same line in the array . it should be remarked that , near the ice regime , @xmath99 is almost independent of @xmath86 ( almost isotropic limit ) and its value is reduced around 20 times whenever this modified system is compared to its counterpart at @xmath5 ( at zero temperature ) . in principle , this result indicates that free monopoles do not appear in this system .",
    "then , the modified array @xcite faces a small obstacle by the fact that the islands are placed in such a way that the spins can not point to the center of a tetrahedron as they do in the @xmath27 materials . indeed , as pointed out before , the spins in the artificial compound point along its edges ( see fig.[vertices ] ) ; the islands are rigid objects that do permit the spins to point only along their longest axis .",
    "this disparity causes an ordering in the artificial material , which diminishes as @xmath0 increases ; eventually it becomes tiny but persists at @xmath30 .",
    "this persistent ordering contributes for the residual string tension at the ice regime and also for the different string tension values as the monopoles are located at different angular positions in the array .",
    "such a difficulty may be overcome when one takes the limit @xmath100 in the modified array . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the mechanism responsible for the equivalence between the artificial ( @xmath9 ) and natural @xmath27 spin ices is not operational in @xmath101 , as it requires also the dimensionality of the dipolar interaction to coincide with that of the underlying lattice . here",
    ", we have a @xmath102 dipolar ( @xmath103 ) and coulombic (  monopolar \" , @xmath104 ) interactions in a two - dimensional array . independent of this ,",
    "since the state @xmath21 is metastable one could imagine if the excitations could be considered to lie in @xmath21 for @xmath0 slightly greater than @xmath105 . in this case the extrapolation of our results indicate that the string tension may vanish at @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ tension ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the energetics of the modified artificial spin ice expressing several quantities , such as ground states energy , magnetic charges and string tension , as a function of the height offset @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis show that the ground - state changes from an ordered antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic one at @xmath107 , which is in good agreement with the value obtained in refs .",
    ", @xmath108 .",
    "we claim that such a small difference comes about from the fact that in these cited works , authors assumed equal nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions , whereas we have taken all the dipole interactions into account . for the excitations above the ground - state",
    "we have found that the magnetic charges interact through the coulomb potential added by a linear confining term with tension @xmath109 , which decreases rapidly as @xmath0 increases , from @xmath110 to @xmath105 , assuming a non - vanishing constant value at higher @xmath0 .",
    "actually , the system presents an anisotropy that manifests itself in both the coulombic and linear interactions and it tends to diminish as @xmath0 increases , almost disappearing at @xmath30 .",
    "the source of this anisotropy is a residual ordering , which still persists even in the ice regime ( at @xmath30 for point - like dipoles ) .",
    "ordering and anisotropy may disappear completely in the ideal limit @xmath100 , @xmath111 .",
    "another interesting result is that the magnetic charge jumps , depending on the direction in which the monopoles are separated , as the system undergoes a transition in its ground state . for a separation of the monopoles , vertex by vertex , along the same line of vertices , which is possible only for the @xmath47 ground state ,",
    "the coupling @xmath60 exhibits considerably discontinuity in relation to its limit value in the @xmath54 ground state . on the other hand",
    ", it tends to grow up continuously for the diagonal path along the transition .",
    "although the residual ordering leads to a confining scenario for monopoles , its very small strength , whenever @xmath4 , signalizes a significant tendency of monopole - pair unbinding at a critical ( optimal ) height offset , even at zero - temperature .",
    "further improvements in model ( 1 ) , for instance , taking the actual finite - size of the dipoles into consideration , could shed some extra light to this issue .",
    "additionally , temperature effects may also facilitate the conditions for free monopoles .",
    "indeed , the string configurational entropy is also proportional to the string size and therefore , at a critical temperature@xcite , on the order of @xmath112 , the monopoles may become free . in view of that , for small @xmath97 , the monopoles should be found unbind at very low temperatures . as a final remark we would like to stress that these results show that the background configuration of spins has a deep effect in the charges interactions , being responsible for the string tension , anisotropies and a kind of screening of the charges .",
