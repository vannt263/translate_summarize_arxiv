    "the experimental achievement of quantum degeneracy in a dilute trapped gas of cold fermionic atoms @xcite has stimulated theoretical interest in the properties of this fundamental system .",
    "attention has focused on the critical temperature @xcite and the detection @xcite of cooper pairing as well as on the properties of mixtures of various fermionic and bosonic species @xcite .",
    "another important problem concerns the interactions between ultracold fermions @xcite . owing to the exclusion principle , spin - polarized fermi atoms",
    "do not interact via s - wave collisions , whereas they dominate in the low - energy regime for bosons and have pronounced effects on the statics and dynamical properties of cold boson gases @xcite .",
    "hence , in the absence of low - energy collisions other types of forces come into play .",
    "a good candidate is a dipole - dipole interaction between atoms or molecules , not analyzed so far in the context of cold trapped fermions .",
    "some atoms possess permanent magnetic dipole moments of considerable magnitude ( chromium , for instance , has @xmath0 ) .",
    "it was also proposed to induce electric dipoles in atoms @xcite .",
    "huge permanent electric dipole moments occur naturally in diatomic polar molecules @xcite .",
    "the behavior of atomic bosonic dipoles in traps has been investigated in @xcite , which addressed the question of instabilities in the system caused by an attractive component of dipolar interactions .",
    "the conclusion drawn was that a large enough positive scattering length ( providing repulsive interactions ) can stabilize a system of bosonic dipoles . for strong ( e.g. molecular ) dipoles , when supposedly the scattering length can be neglected , it is the trap geometry that plays a crucial role @xcite  the system is stable provided the trap assures the domination of repulsive interactions in the gas .",
    "a full quantum mechanical description of the system of many interacting fermions is of course very complex .",
    "but the lessons of semiclassical atomic physics can be applied , in particular the thomas - fermi approach @xcite and its refinements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "its success in describing static properties of atoms is well known , and we note that , in recent years , these methods were also used successfully for studying dynamical processes of atoms and molecules in superstrong light pulses @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the thomas - fermi model is revisited with an eye on the dipole - dipole forces . the dirac correction to the interaction energy term is discussed and scaling properties derived with the help of the virial theorem . in section iii the results of approximate ( nearly analytic ) and numerical minimizations of the thomas - fermi - dirac energy functional are presented .",

    "one should keep in mind the simple situation of two dipoles in the plane perpendicular to their polarization , which repel each other , as opposed to the situation of two attracting dipolar particles placed along the direction of their polarization . extending this picture to a cloud of trapped dipoles",
    "one would expect that attraction dominates in prolate traps , and repulsion in oblate traps ( provided the dipoles are polarized along the trap axis as is the case here ) . in the case of predominant attraction one may surmise that instabilities occur . by varying the two system parameters ( @xmath109 and @xmath13 ) we have investigated the issue of stability , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] .    from this stability diagram one concludes that , for oblate traps ( @xmath16 ) , the bigger the trap aspect ratio , the bigger values of the dipole parameter @xmath109 can be stabilized .",
    "in fact , we found numerically that fermions form stable configurations for @xmath110 irrespective of the strength of their dipole interaction ( an analogous effect was observed for dipolar bosons by santos _",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", one might naively expect an exactly opposite effect in prolate traps ( @xmath15 ) where attractive interactions should dominate .",
    "this is not quite true  indeed for moderate trap aspect ratios ( @xmath111 ) the critical value of the dipole parameter is smaller , but in traps that are very soft ( @xmath112 ) in the @xmath51 direction of rotational symmetry we observe an increase of the critical value of @xmath109 ( see the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : stability ] ) .",
    "this can be understood with the help of the following argument .",
    "we note that the dipole - dipole energy term vanishes for a uniform density distribution .",
    "as the trap is made softer in the polarization direction , the shape of the cloud along the soft axis becomes more and more uniform , contributing to the interaction energy to a lesser extent ( this argument was also used to interpret our earlier results for bosons interacting via contact and dipole - dipole forces , see @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath98 and @xmath99 on @xmath13 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloudparams ] , is consistent with this argument .",
    "we see that @xmath98 decreases with decreasing @xmath13 whereas @xmath99 increases .",
    "accordingly , the cloud gets stretched along the @xmath51 axis of symmetry , and the diameter of the circular cross section in the @xmath113 plane ( @xmath114 ) is reduced . at the center of the cloud , we thus have a relatively large volume of ( almost ) constant density , and the inhomogeneous parts of the cloud are relatively far apart . taken together",
    ", these geometric features lead to a rather small dipole - dipole interaction energy .      whereas the stability of the system considered",
    "can be well understood , the spatial behavior of the fermionic cloud , especially near the collapse , seems to be much less intuitive . as we approach the critical parameter values , the aspect ratio @xmath98 of the cloud decreases and the cloud becomes elongated in the attractive @xmath51 direction .",
    "this type of behavior is general in the sense that it does not depend on the trap aspect ratio , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaofd ] .",
    "it is only for traps with @xmath110 that @xmath98 reaches an asymptotic value ( dependent on @xmath13 ) for extremely large values of @xmath109 .",
    "the dependence of the dipolar energy @xmath17 on the dipole parameter @xmath109 and the trap geometry is also of interest as it is the quantity responsible for the ( in)stability of the system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eddofd ] . for all prolate traps ,",
    "@xmath17 remains negative approaching some critical value at the collapse point . for @xmath115",
    ", the dipolar energy can be positive for moderate dipole parameters , but if their values are large enough , @xmath17 turns negative indicating the collapse . for @xmath110 , @xmath17 is always positive and increases as a function of @xmath109 .      finally , we take a look at the total tfd energy , see fig .  [",
    "fig : etfdofd ] . for @xmath115 ,",
    "the system becomes unstable at the critical value of @xmath109 .",
    "consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] , we observe that larger values of @xmath109 are supported for @xmath116 and @xmath14 than for @xmath117 .",
    "let us now discuss the dipole parameter @xmath109 and give some typical values for it .",
    "owing to the @xmath2 dependence , one can locate the experimental system in various regions of the stability diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] not only by choosing ( or inducing , as proposed for bosons @xcite ) a specific value of @xmath118 , but also , to some extent , by varying @xmath2 .",
    "one could also exploit the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath119 , which is particularly relevant for optical traps with tight confinement @xcite .    for the parameters of the fermionic chromium isotope , @xmath120 hz and @xmath121 , one obtains @xmath122 , which is a very small value . therefore , the conclusion for atoms possessing even relatively large magnetic dipole moments is that irrespective of their number and the trap frequency they will always remain stable against collapse .",
    "the following amusing analogy offers a good reason for this observation @xcite .",
    "let us compare the characteristic sizes of the noninteracting fermi gas and the bose - condensed atomic gas interacting via a repulsive contact potential .",
    "in the thomas - fermi approximation the appropriate quantities , in units of @xmath123 , read : @xmath124 for fermions and @xmath125 for bosons , where @xmath126 is the scattering length . by equating the two sizes",
    "one can calculate the effective , @xmath2 dependent , scattering length due to the exclusion - principle  induced repulsion : @xmath127 . for typical numbers of atoms , @xmath128 ,",
    "this @xmath126 is huge on the scale set by typical scattering lengths for bosonic atoms ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "once we realize how strong is the repulsion that originates in the fermi statistics , we understand that small atomic magnetic dipoles can hardly have a noticeable effect on the behavior of dipolar fermionic gases .",
    "however , for polar molecules the situation is different . for a trap frequency of @xmath120hz and @xmath121 molecules of mass @xmath130 a.m.u .",
    "( the typical mass of an alkaline dimer ) and a typical electric dipole moment of 1 debye , one reaches @xmath131 , which may very well put the system into the unstable regime ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] .",
    "in this situation , a sufficiently large @xmath13 value will stabilize the system .    in order to assess the quality of our variational results we have computed exact numerical solutions of eq.([eq : nonlininteq ] ) .",
