    "macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) and coherence ( mqc ) of the magnetization were intensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in recent years.@xcite more recently , much attention was attracted to the spin tunneling in the single - domain ferromagnetic ( fm ) nanoparticles in the presence of an external magnetic field applied at an arbitrary angle .",
