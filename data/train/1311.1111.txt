    "in this section we explicitly demonstrate that @xmath53 can be used as an order parameter in the description of the spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , we show how the parameter @xmath54 is related to the @xmath103 topological invariant of the two - dimensional time - reversal symmetric insulators .",
    "then , we summarize these results in a phase - diagram , which contains the different phases we found in the numerical calculations .    for the sake of transparency",
    ", we use here our numerical observation that the order parameter can be written as @xmath104 where @xmath59 , and we neglect the asymmetry of effective masses @xmath50 and the spin - orbit couplings @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "all these assumptions can be numerically justified , because for realistic values of these parameters the phase - diagram does not change qualitatively . with these assumptions ,",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian for @xmath105 can be written as @xmath106 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta_s \\sin\\phi_s s_1 \\sigma_2+\\delta_p \\sin \\phi_p   \\big[-s_2 \\sigma_3 k_x - s_1 \\sigma_0 k_y \\big ] , \\label{simph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pauli matrices @xmath107 and @xmath108 describe the layer and the spin degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry operator is defined as @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the complex conjugation operator .",
    "it is easy to see by straightforward calculation that all the terms in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ simph ] ) obey the time - reversal symmetry and all the terms in the second line break it .",
    "therefore , all values of phases @xmath111 result in spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking . on the other hand , using the definition of the order parameter @xmath53 given in the main text and the exciton order parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ ecorderparameter ] ) , we notice that @xmath112 clearly , @xmath113 if and only if @xmath111 , and therefore @xmath53 can be used as an order parameter for description of the spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "we now explain the connection between the order parameter @xmath54 and @xmath103 topological invariant of the two - dimensional time - reversal symmetric insulators .",
    "the @xmath103 topological invariant is only well - defined in the presence of time - reversal symmetry .",

    "however , this is only because we have used the low-@xmath116 expansion of the order parameter instead of taking into account the full momentum dependence of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the relevant scale where the momentum dependent order parameters change must be determined by the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which are approximately equal to each other for typical parameters considered in the main text .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain transparent expression for @xmath54 we use @xmath121 as cut - off momentum in eqs .",
    "( [ p - exp ] ) . this way we obtain @xmath122 in order to describe the connection between the topological invariant",
    ", we need to also consider the other parameters @xmath46 , @xmath42 and @xmath20 and the overall magnitude of the exciton order parameter @xmath123 .",
    "we fix them to the typical values considered in the main text @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and calculate the @xmath103 topological invariant as a function of @xmath54 for hamiltonian ( [ simphtrs ] ) .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ phasediagrampt ] , and can be understood by repeatedly utilizing the powerful result that @xmath103 topological invariant can only change when the energy gap of the system closes .",
    "first , we notice that for @xmath128 the @xmath0-wave exciton order parameter strongly dominates the tunneling terms and the @xmath1-wave exciton order parameter .",
    "therefore , in this case it is possible to adiabatically set @xmath129 without closing the energy gap . by inspecting the hamiltonian ( [ simphtrs ] ) in this limit ,",
    "we notice that it is topologically indistinguishable from the usual bcs s - wave superconductor , which is well - known to be topologically trivial i.e.  it does not support edge states .",
    "second , in the opposite limit @xmath130 the p - wave exciton order parameter dominates , and it is possible to adiabatically set @xmath131 without closing the energy gap . in this",
    "limit the system is described by the bernevig - hughes - zhang hamiltonian in the topologically nontrivial phase .",
    "finally , we find that if we continuously change @xmath54 from @xmath132 to @xmath133 there is exactly one value of @xmath54 , where the energy gap closes .",
    "this means that the @xmath103 topological invariant must change at this point , and we have obtained the full phase - diagram shown in fig .  [ phasediagrampt ] .",
    "the two most important parameters concerning the exciton order parameter are the tunnel couplings @xmath42 and @xmath20 , because they act as symmetry breaking terms in the hamiltonian , turning the second order phase transition to the exciton condensate phase into a crossover . as we explained in the main text",
    ", these parameters fix the spin structure of the exciton order parameter .",
    "however , additionally , they control the phase - boundaries between the different types of exciton condensate phases . in the main text",
    ", we showed the phase diagram of our model for @xmath49 , and found three distinct phases ( trivial insulator , time - reversal broken insulator and quantum spin hall insulator phases ) in different regimes of the phase - diagram . here , we address the question how the magnitude of @xmath20 affects the phase - boundaries between these phases .",
    "the phase - diagrams for different values of @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagramsupp ] . based on these figures",
    "we conclude that increasing @xmath20 shifts the phase - boundaries to larger values of @xmath42 as one would have expected",

    "secondly , the area of the time - reversal broken insulating phase shrinks with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "we can understand this in the framework of ginzburg - landau theory by noticing that the terms @xmath135 and @xmath136 try to pin the phases of the s- and p - wave exciton order parameters to zero , and thus for large enough @xmath20 and @xmath42 it becomes energetically less favorable for the system to spontaneously break the time - reversal symmetry .",
