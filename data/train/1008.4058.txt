    "this galaxy is one of the targets of the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) nearby galaxies legacy survey ( ngls ) @xcite whose goals include searching for molecular gas and dust in nearby galaxies and comparing the global properties of such systems .",
    "in addition , the spatial and spectral coverage of the 325 - 375 ghz band presented by the new heterodyne array receiver programme - b - band ( harp - b ) detector together with the wide - band auto - correlation spectrometer imaging system ( acsis ) has also made it possible to study individual galaxies in the sample in some detail .",
    "for ngc  4631 , our goals are to examine the co(j=3 - 2 ) properties and distribution in this unique galaxy and to relate , where possible , the molecular emission to known outflow features .        the strength , prevalence , and multi - phase aspects of the halo of ngc  4631 make this galaxy unique and an important target for disk - halo studies . the halo is observed in all ism components , including cosmic rays ( crs ) and magnetic fields as indicated by polarized radio continuum emission @xcite , hi @xcite diffuse ionized gas @xcite , dust @xcite , molecular gas @xcite , and hot , x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "expanding shells have also been observed in hi @xcite and co(j=1 - 0 ) @xcite .",
    "the halo extends over the entire star forming disk , reaching a variety of vertical heights , @xmath6 , depending on the component considered , from 900 pc in molecular gas @xcite to 10 kpc in the radio continuum @xcite .",

    "large edge - on galaxy about @xmath11 ( 84 kpc , @xmath12 km s@xmath10 ) to the south - east , the result being 4 long intergalactic hi streamers @xcite stretching to @xmath1342 kpc .",
    "the bases of these tidal streamers overlap with the halo of ngc  4631 . in addition , three more faint companions have been detected in hi @xcite as well as a faint optical dwarf galaxy candidate , ngc  4631 dw a , @xmath14 kpc below the plane of ngc  4631 @xcite for which no redshift data are yet available . of these companions , two ( ngc  4627 and ngc  4631 dw a ) fall within the field shown in fig .",

    "presumably , the star formation ( sf ) activity ( and hence the halo ) in ngc  4631 has been triggered and/or enhanced by interactions .",
    "interactions have also likely produced the observed thick stellar disk , i.e. the optical emission shows @xmath15 scale heights , @xmath16 , up to 1.4 kpc ( depending on the stellar population considered ) with detections to many scale heights in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "studies of the mid - ir emission and dust properties in ngc  4631 can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] the conclusions .",
    ".basic parameters of ngc  4631 [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      as indicated in the previous section , the anomalous velocity features seen in the pv plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] ) are not easily traced to high latitudes .",
    "however , we do see some evidence for the presence of high latitude co(j=3 - 2 ) in the data .    fig .",
    "[ fig : mom0_optical ] shows that the disk thickness of ngc  4631 varies with position , but at least within the central molecular ring , the evidence suggests that ngc  4631 forms a thick , rather than a thin distribution . a thin global molecular gas disk with the observed diameter of the co(j=3 - 2 ) emission ( see sect .  [ sec : results : outerdisk ] ) which is inclined by 86@xmath20 ( table  [ tab : galaxy_params ] ) would project to a total apparent vertical extent of only 48@xmath21 including the smoothing effects of the beam , whereas the total observed minor axis extent is approximately 65@xmath21 ( 2.3 kpc after beam correction , or @xmath22 kpc ) .",
    "if the inclination of the central molecular ring were as low as 83@xmath23 , then it could be interpreted as thin .",
    "however , our model of the central molecular ring ( table  [ tab : ring_model ] ) gives best results for an even higher inclination ( @xmath24 ) ; lower values are poorer .",
    "to further investigate the vertical extent of the molecular gas , we have formed a plot at high sensitivity showing the minor axis profile by averaging over a 100@xmath21-wide region of the major axis ( i.e. approximately over the fwhm of the central molecular ring ) and then averaging the north / south sides .",
    "the result , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : minoraxis ] , reveals a complex profile which is not well described by a single smooth fit .",
    "co(j=3 - 2 ) can be traced out to @xmath25 ( 1.4 kpc ) , correcting for beam smoothing .",
    "thus , the central molecular ring of ngc  4631 appears to have a thick vertical distribution of co. given the known halo activity in this galaxy , most of which has been measured to much larger values of @xmath6 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , the presence of thick , agitated molecular gas is perhaps not surprising . for comparison",
    ", we note that main sequence stars in ngc  4631 have been measured out to a @xmath6 height of 2.3 kpc and agb and rgb stars have been measured to even higher @xmath6 values @xcite .     averaged over a 100@xmath21 wide region centered at the nucleus . the profiles to the north and south",
    "have also been averaged to form a sensitive plot .",

    "[ fig : mom0_optical ] ) .",
    "the projected minor axis extent of a thin disk of radius , @xmath27 , inclined at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and then smoothed by the beam , is given by the thick vertical line segment . ]",
    "we see no evidence from the pv plots ( fig .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although the vertical extent of molecular gas in ngc  4631 is , in general , smaller than these other components .    fig .  [",
    "fig : mom0_optical ] also shows a number of disconnected emission features above and below the plane at distances of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 kpc ) . the smoothing and noise cut - off techniques used to create the total intensity image are ideal for emphasizing such low level emission which generally can only be seen in cubes that are smoothed , rather than in the original channel maps .",
    "their emission is contiguous in velocity space and several can be identified in the independently reduced , lower velocity resolution data of @xcite . however , since not every one can be independently confirmed , we do not label each individually and only consider the energetics ( below ) of a ` typical ' feature . for the purpose of discussion",
    ", we refer to them as high latitude ` clouds ' .",
    "[ fig : wangs_overlay ] , which emphasizes the low level emission of fig .",
    "[ fig : mom0_optical ] , shows how these clouds exist above apparent disturbances in the disk .",
    "for example , there are clouds both above and below the location of the western hi supershell ( the western x ) .",
    "there is also a cloud above the plane and a complete loop below the plane at the location of feature f5 .",
    "these clouds have masses of m@xmath32 m@xmath5 and estimated potential energies of , @xmath33\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "input energies are likely higher still ( cf . @xmath37 , @xmath38 in table  [ tab : anomalous ] ) if these clouds have originated in the disk .",
    "further discussion can be found in sect .",

    "approximate locations of the features identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv ] are marked as well as the two hi shells ( marked with x ) identified by rand & van der hulst ( 1993 ) . ]      as indicated in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the halo of ngc  4631 has been observed in every ism component .",
    "since the halo is so extensive and there is overlap with the broader hi tidal streamers , some caution must also be exercised in identifying correlations as they may be due to chance projections along the line of sight ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the features that we have identified ( table  [ tab : anomalous ] ) are mostly visible in pv space , rather than in ra - dec and we have thus not found counterparts at other wavebands , other than f3 as noted in sect .",
    "[ subsec : results : supershells ] which is associated with a co(j=1 - 0 ) expanding shell .    a possible high latitude dust arch , discovered by @xcite , but interpreted as part of hi tidal spur 4 by @xcite , has its footprint in the disk at approximately the position of the west hi expanding shell . at this location ,",
    "early x - ray images show hot gas extending into the halo , as shown most clearly in @xcite ( their fig .",
    "more recent x - ray images ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wangs_overlay ] ) show emission from hot gas which has originated from the disk and is associated with h@xmath39 emission and a ` froth ' of superbubbles @xcite .",
    "given the varying distributions of the x - ray and co(j=3 - 2 ) components and the edge - on nature of the galaxy , fig .",
    "[ fig : wangs_overlay ] does not show clear correlations between the two components .",
    "however , it is clear that the stronger x - ray halo emission is located over the region of the central molecular ring .    finally , one high latitude co(j=3 - 2 ) feature , namely the southern loop associated with f5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wangs_overlay ] ) , does appear to have an h@xmath39 counterpart in the form of two h@xmath39 spurs , the latter seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlays]a . to the east of the two spurs is a third h@xmath39 spur that appears to have a counterpart in the @xmath40 @xmath41 m emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overlays]c ) .",
    "a picture has emerged of ngc  4631 as an actively star forming galaxy , but not one with a central starburst .",
    "approximately 80% of the massive star formation in this galaxy occurs outside of the central 1.8@xmath18 ( 4.7 kpc ) diameter region and h@xmath39 and uv emission in the disk are also widely distributed . the x - ray halo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wangs_overlay ] ) , which resembles the well - known radio halo @xcite , is similarly widespread over the entire star forming disk .",
    "widespread halo emission is seen in all ism components ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : intro ] for references ) and all evidence , including the presence of hi supershells , a co(j=1 - 0 ) expanding shell , vertical filaments , the vertical structure of the magnetic field lines , the concentration of stronger halo emission over stronger star forming regions in the disk , and now co(j=3 - 2 ) anomalous velocity features point to star forming regions and their related supernovae and stellar winds in the disk as the origin of the halo .",
    "the question is , why does ngc  4631 , whose halo is arguably the most spectacular ever observed , have such a wide - spread , prominent halo in comparison to other edge - on galaxies ?    to consider this question , it is worth comparing ngc  4631 to two other galaxies : ngc  5775 , which has a similarly wide - spread multi - phase halo @xcite , and m  82 , which is the prototypical nuclear starburst with bipolar outflow .",
    "all three galaxies have significant companions with which they are interacting , the most obvious evidence being the presence of hi bridges or streamers between them @xcite . for ngc  4631",
    ", the interaction is with the large spiral , ngc  4656 and the dwarf elliptical , ngc  4627 ( sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "these interactions may have played an important role in forming their halos via tidal disruptions or agitation of the disk .",
    "for example , if the disk has become ` puffed up ' , such as we seem to see in the thick co(j=3 - 2 ) layer in ngc  4631 ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : results : thickness ] ) , it would be easier for material to escape into the halo .",
    "stellar winds and supernovae should also produce thickened gaseous disks as material escapes vertically into the halo . for ngc  4631 , since the stellar disk also extends several kpc above the plane ( sects .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ,  [ subsec : results : thickness ] ) , the interaction has most likely played an important direct role .    as for star formation , m  82 , ngc  5775 and ngc  4631 all have similar fir luminosities to within a factor of about 2 , but their luminosities per unit optical disk area , a distance - independent quantity , vary in the ratio , 1:0.16:0.05 in the order listed above @xcite .",
    "ngc  5775 and ngc  4631 , which both show disk - wide halos , differ by only a factor of 3 .",
    "m  82 , on the other hand , has a sfr per unit area that is higher than that of ngc  4631 by a factor of 20 . since m  82 has been well - studied , it is possible to compare activity within the nuclear region itself . for m  82 ,",
    "the supernova rate in the central 700 pc is @xmath42 yr@xmath10 @xcite . from eqn .",
    "[ equation1 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_mass]d , and relations in @xcite , we find @xmath43 yr@xmath10 for an equivalently sized region at the center of ngc  4631 .",
    "that is , the central supernova rate in ngc  4631 is two orders of magnitude smaller than in m  82 , hence the nuclear outflow in m  82 but not in ngc  4631 .",
    "it is well known that interactions can trigger a build - up of molecular gas in galaxy centers and can also induce strong central starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "what is particularly striking about ngc  4631 is the presence of strong central molecular emission in a ring out to a radius of @xmath44 5 kpc ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : major_axis ] ) but without a central starburst .",
    "the physical properties of the ring are typical of galaxy disks , rather than other known nuclear starbursts ( sect .",
    "[ sec : results : excitation ] ) and the star formation efficiency is not very high ; that is , if sf continues at the current rate , there is sufficient molecular gas to sustain it for at least @xmath45 yr . inside the ring , within the central 17@xmath21 ( 740 pc ) diameter region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_mass ] ) the sfr is enhanced and there is a peak in the hot dust distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] ) as well as a small peak in co(j=3 - 2 ) ( fig .  [",
    "fig : major_axis ] ) .",
    "even here , however , the gas consumption time scale is at least @xmath3 yr . if the interaction is to trigger a central starburst in ngc  4631 , then it has already happened or it has not happened yet .",
    "@xcite have added further confirmation to the notion that , although bursts of sf can occur as a result of interactions and there is a tendency for the star formation to be centrally concentrated , interactions can also initiate continuous star formation over longer timescales , ie . a few @xmath46 yrs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for ngc  4631 , the interaction with its companion occurred @xmath47 years ago @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that at least one burst of star formation ( or higher sfr ) has already occurred in ngc  4631 . from uv observations @xcite note that the _ current _ rate of sf does not seem to account for other indications of strong outflow in this galaxy .",
    "for example , the eastern hi shell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mom0_optical ] ) can be explained by supernovae from a massive sf region containing @xmath48 ob stars beginning about @xmath49 yr ago and that the currently observed uv emission ( which is insufficient to explain the shell ) is due to second generation stars . our own estimates for the lifetimes of the observed co(j=3 - 2 )",
    "anomalous velocity features are approximately the same ( table  [ tab : anomalous ] ) and , estimated the same way , the hi supershells observed by @xcite also result in ages of a few @xmath50 yr .",
    "these results suggest that a higher rate of sf may have occurred of order @xmath51 yr ago .",
    "however , as noted in sect .",
    "[ subsec : results : supershells ] , selection effects may have prevented us from detecting features with larger or smaller lifetimes , so we can not place a limit on the timescale for past sf in general .",
    "estimates for the kinetic energies of the anomalous velocity features are of order @xmath52 ergs and estimates of potential energy of the small clouds above and below the plane are about the same ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : results : thickness ] ) .",
    "the implied input energies are higher still , possibly by an order of magnitude ( table  [ tab : anomalous ] ) , a conclusion also implied for the energetics of the outflowing molecular gas in the nuclear outflow of m  82 @xcite .",
    "these energies are also typical of what has been previously seen for hi and co expanding shells in other galaxies ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : results : supershells ] ) and are quite high . if the observed features are associated with a higher sfr in the past as suggested above , however , the energies may be sufficient .",
    "supernovae from the stars that are believed to be responsible for the eastern hi supershell could supply ( at 10@xmath53 ergs each ) @xmath54 ergs for this shell which is more than adequate .",
    "however , there would need to be at least five such sf regions throughout the region of the central molecular ring to account for all of the features of table  [ tab : anomalous ] .",
    "there is still some need for time - dependent modelling of such outflows in a realistic multi - phase , multi - density , and magnetised ism .    the prominent radio halo in ngc  4631 actually reflects an integration over past sf activity in the disk .",
    "the average magnetic field strength in the disk of ngc  4631 is @xmath55 @xmath41 g @xcite with a cr electron lifetime estimate of @xmath56 yrs .",
    "the ratio between the halo and disk magnetic field strength is 5/8 @xcite yielding an average halo field strength of @xmath57 @xmath41 g and , since @xmath58 , the cr lifetime in the halo is @xmath59 yrs .",
    "consequently , the radio halo that we see today has a memory of outflows that have occurred since approximately the time that the interaction occurred , assuming that the outflows have not escaped into the intergalactic medium . whether or not this assumption is correct requires deeper and more extensive mapping of the magnetic field direction than is currently available",
    "however , arguments presented in @xcite suggest that even in the more energetic nuclear outflow of m  82 , at least the molecular gas and dust do not escape .",
    "the implication of a higher sfr in the past suggests that , when strong halos such as in ngc  4631 and ngc  5775 are observed , they may have been enhanced by a previous outflow event ( or events ) .",
    "although rather speculative , another possibility is that such galaxies have also experienced a stronger m  82-like starburst and nuclear outflow in the past that was triggered by the interaction . in the case of ngc  4631",
    ", the enhanced sfr right at the nucleus could be a remnant of a past ` m  82-like ' nuclear starburst .",
    "we could imagine the interior of the nuclear molecular ring to have been excavated by massive star formation and outflow .",
    "the minimum near the nucleus at ` c ' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mom0_optical ] ) could reflect local variations in sfr and molecular content .",
    "the past additional ` boost ' of outflow material into the halo may be what is required to distinguish between spectacular halos and those that are more modest .",
    "as part of the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey , we have mapped the co(j=3 - 2 ) emission from the edge - on galaxy , ngc  4631 , which is known for its spectacular multi - phase gaseous halo .",
    "most of the co(j=3 - 2 ) emission is concentrated within a radius of @xmath44 5 kpc .",
    "although the spatial distribution could be more complex , the emission is well modelled by a simple edge - on ring with a gaussian density distribution which peaks at a radius of 1.8 kpc and has inner and outer scale lengths of 0.1 and 0.28 kpc , respectively .",
    "the center of the ring agrees with the ir center .",
    "a small co(j=3 - 2 ) peak occurs within this ring , right at the nucleus . outside of the central molecular ring ,",
    "weaker more extensive disk emission is present which has been mapped out as far as 9.25 kpc to the east of the nucleus and 12.4 kpc to west .",
    "this radial extent exceeds that of any previous co observations .",
    "comparisons have been made between co(j=3 - 2 ) , @xmath60 m , @xmath61 m emission and h@xmath62 .",
    "we find that the co(j=3 - 2 ) emission more closely follows @xmath60 m ( a hot dust tracer ) rather than @xmath61 m emission ( a cold dust tracer ) , suggesting that co(j=3 - 2 ) is a good tracer of star formation .",
    "emission is uncorrelated because of the high extinction in this edge - on galaxy .    for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region of the central molecular ring ,",
    "we have formed the first spatially resolved maps of @xmath0 , the h@xmath1 mass surface density , and the sfe for ngc  4631 .",
    "only 20% of the global sf occurs in this region .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is typical of galaxy disks , in general , rather than of regions associated with central starbursts .",
    "molecular cloud densities ( @xmath63 @xmath64 ) in this region are also typical of molecular clouds in galaxy disks rather than central starbursts .",
    "the sfe in this region is , on average , @xmath65 yr@xmath10 leading to a mean gas consumption timescale of @xmath66 yr for the h@xmath1 and longer if hi is included .",
    "that is , the sfr in this region is modest when compared to the abundant gas that is present .",
    "there is , however , an enhanced sfr and sfe right at the nucleus ( within a central region of 740 pc diameter ) , although the gas consumption timescale is still long ( @xmath3 yr ) .",
    "the total molecular gas mass in ngc  4631 is m@xmath67 m@xmath5 , which improves upon previous values .",
    "since the total hi mass is m@xmath68 m@xmath5 , the total gaseous content of the galaxy is dominated by hi .",
    "the global gas - to - dust ratio is 170 .",
    "the velocity field of ngc  4631 is dominated by the steeply rising rotation curve of the central molecular ring followed by the flatter outer disk ; the peak rotational velocity is @xmath69 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the total dynamical mass within 11 kpc radius is @xmath70 m@xmath5 . at the center of the galaxy ,",
    "we find a steep rotation curve , providing the first evidence for a central concentration of mass , i.e. m@xmath4 m@xmath5 within a radius of 282 pc .",
    "we can now add co(j=3 - 2 ) emission to the long list of evidence for outflowing gas in ngc  4631 .",
    "five anomalous velocity features with properties similar to those found in expanding shells ( or parts thereof ) in other galaxies have been detected , all associated with the central molecular ring .",
    "one of these ( f3 ) corresponds to an expanding co(j=1 - 0 ) shell previously found by @xcite .",
    "the galaxy also has a thick co(3 - 2 ) disk which we trace to a @xmath6 height of 1.4 kpc .",
    "some small ` clouds ' are observed at higher latitudes , possibly associated with outflows from the disk .",
    "we suggest a scenario in which interactions with the companion galaxies in the past has produced enhanced star formation throughout the disk and speculate that there could have been a massive nuclear outflow in the past .",

    "<S> we have made the first map of co(j=3 - 2 ) emission covering the disk of the edge - on galaxy , ngc  4631 , which is known for its spectacular gaseous halo . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest emission , which we model with a gaussian ring , occurs within a radius of 5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> weaker disk emission is detected out to radii of 12 kpc , the most extensive molecular component yet seen in this galaxy . from comparisons with infrared data </S>",
    "<S> , we find that co(j=3 - 2 ) emission more closely follows the hot dust component , rather than the cold dust , consistent with it being a good tracer of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the first maps of @xmath0 , h@xmath1 mass surface density and sfe have been made for the inner 2.4 kpc radius region . </S>",
    "<S> only 20% of the sf occurs in this region and excitation conditions are typical of galaxy disks , rather than of central starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the sfe suggests long gas consumption timescales ( @xmath2 @xmath3 yr ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field is dominated by a steeply rising rotation curve in the region of the central molecular ring followed by a flatter curve in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> a very steep gradient in the rotation curve is observed at the nucleus , providing the first evidence for a central concentration of mass : m@xmath4 m@xmath5 within a radius of 282 pc . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field shows anomalous features indicating the presence of molecular outflows ; one of them is associated with a previously observed co(j=1 - 0 ) expanding shell . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with these outflows is the presence of a thick ( @xmath6 up to @xmath7 kpc ) co(j=3 - 2 ) disk . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the interaction between ngc  4631 and its companion(s ) has agitated the disk and also initiated star formation which was likely higher in the past than it is now . </S>",
    "<S> these may be necessary conditions for seeing prominent halos .    </S>",
