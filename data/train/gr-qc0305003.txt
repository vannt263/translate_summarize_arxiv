    "in this paper we present results from a numerical study of critical collapse of the massless scalar field in axisymmetry .",
    "in spherical symmetry , the threshold of black hole formation was first systematically explored in  @xcite , which described intriguing behavior , called _ critical phenomena _ , in solutions approaching the threshold .",
    "this behavior includes _ power - law scaling _ of the mass @xmath0 of black holes that form in the super - critical regime , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a _",
    "universal _ constant ( i.e. independent of the initial data ) called the _ scaling exponent_. here , @xmath3 is a parameter describing some aspect of the initial distribution of scalar field energy such that for @xmath4 black holes form during evolution , while for @xmath5 all of the scalar field disperses to infinity .",
    "thus , @xmath6 denotes the threshold of black hole formation for the particular family of initial data under consideration .",
    "the solution approached in the limit @xmath7 , called the critical solution , was also conjectured to be universal , in that all one - parameter ( @xmath3 ) families of initial data having a threshold parameter @xmath6 should exhibit the _ same _ critical solution in the vicinity of collapse .",
    "in addition , the critical solution for the real scalar field is discretely self - similar , characterized by an _ echoing exponent _ @xmath8 . since the initial discovery reported in  @xcite , critical phenomena",
    "have been observed in numerous systems ",
    "see @xcite for recent review articles on the subject .",
    "note that the particular behavior observed in the threshold solution depends upon the matter model and spacetime dimensionality .    to date",
    ", the only non - perturbative calculation of critical gravitational collapse away from spherical symmetry was carried out by abrahams and evans @xcite , who studied the collapse of pure gravitational waves in axisymmetry ( note that axisymmetry is the ` minimal ' symmetry one can impose on gravitational waves and retain the possibility of black hole formation ) .",
    "in addition , the threshold of singularity formation in a non - linear sigma model in three dimensions was considered in  @xcite , and found to exhibit features similar to critical gravitational collapse .",
    "these studies provide evidence that critical phenomena _ is _ observed beyond spherical symmetry at the respective thresholds of these two distinct physical systems .",
    "an explanation for critical phenomena , in particular the observed universality of the solution and departures from it in near - critical collapse , is offered by positing that the critical solution , when perturbed , has _ exactly one unstable mode _ @xcite . that there is only one unstable mode allows the threshold solution to be found in a numerical collapse `` experiment '' whereby we fine - tune a single parameter of a generic family of initial data .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the unstable mode eventually dominates the properties of near - critical solutions ; for example , the scaling exponent @xmath2 can be shown to be equal to the inverse of the exponential growth factor @xmath9 of the unstable mode .    the purpose of the present study is to move beyond spherical symmetry and to explore the threshold of black hole formation from the collapse of axisymmetric distributions of the massless scalar field .",
    "linear perturbation studies of the scalar field critical solution beyond spherical symmetry were carried out by martn - garca and gundlach @xcite ( a similar analysis has also been performed by gundlach @xcite for the case of perfect fluid collapse ) .",
    "their study found no additional growing modes beyond the one seen in spherical collapse , a result that suggests that we should expect to see the spherical critical solution emerge from our axisymmetric studies .",
    "having looked at a variety of initial configurations of the scalar field , some deviating significantly from spherical symmetry , we find that in all cases during the early phases of near - critical evolution , we _ do _ see a discretely self - similar solution unfold that can be described as the spherically symmetric critical solution plus perturbations .",
    "however , in contrast to the perturbation theory calculations in @xcite , we find some evidence for a second , slowly growing unstable mode , with an angular dependence described by the @xmath10 spherical harmonic .",
    "the simulations suggest that this mode will eventually cause a near - critical solution , with some asymmetries , to `` bifurcate '' into two distinct echoing solutions , which , individually , would subsequently be subject to the same instability . in principle then , if we could fine tune to arbitrary precision , this bifurcate behavior would be repeated indefinitely .",
    "the appearance of this second unstable mode is in conflict with the above - mentioned perturbative results .",
    "one possibility is that the non - spherical mode that appears unstable in our simulations is in fact damped in the continuum limit , and only grows within the context of our discrete numerical approximation .",
    "our current code ( running on the computer systems to which we have access ) can not provide the accuracy needed to _ conclusively _ determine that the growth rate of the suspect mode is positive in the continuum limit , and not dominated by truncation error effects .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ system ] we briefly describe the relevant system of equations , the numerical code used to solve them , and various properties of the solution that we will analyze . details of the formalism and numerical technique can be found in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we describe several of the families of initial data that we have studied , and present the results from corresponding near - critical collapse simulations .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] by summarizing the results and possible future directions of study .",
    "we are interested in solving the einstein field equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ricci tensor , @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , and we use geometric units with newton s constant @xmath14 and the speed of light @xmath15 set to 1 .",
    "we adopt a massless scalar field @xmath16 as the matter source , with corresponding stress - energy tensor @xmath17 given by @xmath18 and the evolution of @xmath16 is governed by the wave equation @xmath19 note that ( [ set ] ) differs by a factor of @xmath20 from the convention of hawking and ellis @xcite , which amounts to rescaling @xmath16 by a factor of @xmath21 .    we restrict our attention to axisymmetric spacetimes without angular momentum , and choose the following cylindrical coordinate system , adapted to the symmetry @xmath22 .",
    "\\label{metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the axial killing vector is @xmath23 and hence all the metric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and scalar field @xmath16 depend only on @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we use the @xmath28 formalism @xcite to arrive at the system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) that we need to solve , which in the absence of angular momentum is the same set of pdes that the adm decomposition provides .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint yields an elliptic pde for the conformal factor @xmath29 , and the @xmath30 and @xmath31 momentum constraints give elliptic pdes for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 components of the shift vector , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we choose maximal slicing , in particular @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the extrinsic curvature tensor of @xmath36 slices ; this condition gives an elliptic equation for the lapse function @xmath37 .",
    "we convert the hyperbolic evolution equations for @xmath25 and @xmath16 to first order form by defining `` conjugate '' variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 by @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "we thus end up with a mixed hyperbolic - elliptic system of pdes for the @xmath42 variables @xmath43 and @xmath39 that we approximately solve using second - order accurate finite difference ( fd ) techniques .",
    "the hyperbolic fd equations are solved using an iterative crank - nicholson scheme with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , and the elliptic fd equations are solved ( on the adaptive grid hierarchy ) using the fas multigrid algorithm . at @xmath44 , we freely specify @xmath45 and @xmath39 , then solve the @xmath46 constraint equations and slicing condition for the remaining variables .",
    "after @xmath44 , we continue to use the momentum constraints to solve for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the slicing condition for @xmath37 , but in lieu of the hamiltonian constraint , we update @xmath29 using the first order in time evolution equation that follows from the definition of the the extrinsic curvature .",
    "( thus , we employ a _ partially constrained _ evolution . )",
    "we add kreiss - oliger dissipation to the differenced form of the hyperbolic equations , to reduce unwanted ( and un - physical ) high - frequency components in their solutions .",
    "for outer boundary conditions , we apply outgoing radiation ( or sommerfeld ) conditions on @xmath47 and @xmath38 , and appropriate asymptotic fall - off behavior for the remaining variables , assuming an asymptotically flat coordinate system .",
    "more details on the boundary conditions , system of equations and the numerical scheme ( including various tests ) can be found in @xcite ; a detailed description of the amr implementation is given in @xcite      in section  [ results ] we will quantitatively describe the near - critical solution for any given family of initial data by measuring its associated scaling exponent ( @xmath2 ) , echoing parameter ( @xmath8 ) , the local minima / maxima attained by the scalar field during each half - echo , and deviations of the scalar field from a spherically symmetric profile .",
    "that we _ can _ define such properties for all the solutions is an indication that they are similar enough that a comparison is meaningful .",
    "however , it is _ not _ a trivial task to compute some of these quantities , because we need to make sure that we are calculating them in a coordinate independent fashion .",
    "our coordinate system is not `` symmetry - seeking ''  @xcite , and the initial data is sufficiently different among the various families that we can expect , and in some cases clearly see , `` gauge '' differences between solutions that are apparently quite similar .",
    "the simplest quantity to calculate is the scaling exponent @xmath2 .",
    "we use the method proposed by garfinkle and duncan @xcite , whereby we measure the maximum value @xmath48 attained by the absolute value of the ricci scalar , @xmath49 , in a set of sub - critical evolutions ; @xmath2 can then be obtained from the following property of near - critical solutions @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 is a periodic function of its argument with period @xmath53 that describes a small `` wiggle '' superimposed on an otherwise linear relationship . as a result ,",
    "we can also use ( [ lnrp_def ] ) to obtain an estimate for @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the effectiveness of our use of  ( [ lnrp_def ] ) to compute @xmath2 and @xmath8 is predicated on the degree to which our computed near - critical solutions _ are _ well approximated by a discretely self - similar solution with a single unstable mode . in addition , although  ( [ lnrp_def ] ) provides the only method we use to estimate @xmath2 , we also measure @xmath8 using a more direct procedure outlined below .",
    "the direct comparison of results from our axisymmetric code to those from a spherically symmetric computation presents more of a challenge . in order to compare `` local self - similar solutions''portions of the computed spacetime that appear to be approximately self - similar about some center of symmetry  we need an invariant way of slicing the spacetime in the region of interest . to accomplish this",
    ", we use a sequence of outgoing null hypersurfaces , starting from the local center of symmetry @xmath54 , to generate the common slices along which we compare @xmath16 . to construct each such null hypersurface ,",
    "we evolve a family of null geodesics , with affine parameter @xmath55 and initial tangent vectors equally spaced in @xmath56 , outward from @xmath57 .",
    "the geodesics are synchronized by setting @xmath58 at the start of integration , where @xmath59 is the proper time measured by a timelike observer that is stationary relative to the center of symmetry .",
    "@xmath59 is the time of relevance to critical collapse , for in coordinates @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the _ accumulation _ point of the critical solution ( i.e. the central proper time of the central singularity formed by the cascade of the critical solution down to infinitesimally small scales ) , the central value of the scalar field is a periodic function of @xmath60 , with period @xmath8 .",
    "estimation of the period of the profile of @xmath16 along the local center of symmetry , with respect to @xmath59 thus gives us the alternate method for computing @xmath8 .    during a simulation",
    ", we integrate @xmath55 as a function of @xmath27 for each null geodesic labeled by @xmath62 , and record @xmath63 ( we typically use @xmath64 geodesics per slice , linearly spaced in @xmath65 ) .",
    "if two solutions from different families of initial data do locally tend to the same discretely self - similar solution , then @xmath63 ( synchronized so that the null integration is started at the same time within the periodic oscillation ) will tend to the same function , regardless of differences in the @xmath66 coordinate systems between the two solutions .    as a final comment in regards to our analysis , we note that to calculate @xmath59 we integrate a central timelike geodesic , and measure proper time along it .",
    "we can do this for families of initial data that are symmetric about @xmath67 , for then we know that the center of symmetry will , at least initially , be at @xmath68 . an interesting aspect of the numerical solution is that truncation error effects cause a small drift to occur in the @xmath31 location of the local center of symmetry , during a near - critical evolution .",
    "this drift is quite small ( and does appear to converge away with increasing resolution ) , typically being less than 1 part in @xmath69 of the size of the computational domain .",
    "however , because of the exponentially decreasing length scales that arise in a critical collapse , this is a _ huge _ drift relative to the size of the local self - similar region at late times .",
    "hence , if we simply measured central proper time at @xmath70 , and correspondingly integrated null geodesics from this location , we would entirely miss the relevant part of the solution .",
    "fortunately , the timelike observer initially placed at @xmath68 experiences an identical drift , and so we can use its location and proper time to do the desired measurements . for initial data that is not plane - symmetric ( the only such family described in the next section is the `` anti - symmetric '' example ) we have not yet been able to devise a method to accurately track the local center of symmetry for long periods of time , and hence have not been able to calculate @xmath59 for these families .",
    "however , at least at key moments during the evolution , we are able to accurately determine the center of symmetry ( by looking at local minima or maxima of @xmath16 , for instance ) , to use as the starting point for the null integration .",
    "here we present results from the critical collapse of several families of initial data .",
    "these families consist of a time - symmetric series of prolate spheroids , with ellipticity @xmath71 ( defined by looking at surfaces of constant @xmath16 ) : @xmath72 and an initially ingoing distribution in @xmath16 that is anti - symmetric about @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath73 : @xmath74 in all cases we set @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and vary the amplitude @xmath77 when searching for the threshold solution .",
    "we show results for six families of ( [ prolate_ic ] ) , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in ( [ anti_ic ] ) , @xmath80 is a parameter describing how far the initial pulse of matter begins from the origin ; we have chosen @xmath81 . in all cases presented here",
    "the outer boundary of the computational domain is at @xmath82 , though in other simulations we have varied its position to make sure that the above choice does not significantly impact the results .",
    "the base level in the adaptive hierarchy used a resolution of @xmath83 points , and up to 28 additional 2:1-refined levels were used in the most nearly critical case .",
    "our amr implementation is based on the algorithm of berger and oliger  @xcite , wherein regridding is determined through estimates of the local truncation error ( solution error ) in the computed solution .",
    "the key control parameter that determines placement of refinements is the truncation error threshold , @xmath84 : mesh refinements are introduced in an attempt to keep the magnitude of the local truncation error estimate @xmath85 throughout the solution domain . for each family of initial data studied",
    ", we generally tuned to threshold using three different values of @xmath84 , namely @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "most of the data presented here are from @xmath89 runs ( i.e. finest effective resolution ) , with the results computed using the less stringent values of @xmath84 then being used to give some estimate of how close to the continuum solution we may be ( though convergence testing with an adaptive code is not trivial , particularly in the critical limit ) .",
    "there are of course , infinitely many different parametrized families that we could have considered  those used to generate the results discussed here were chosen for the following specific reasons .",
    "first , the anti - symmetric configuration ( [ anti_ic ] ) provides a more drastic departure from spherical symmetry than any family of data that can smoothly be deformed into a spherical distribution ( such as ( [ prolate_ic ] ) by letting @xmath90 ) . in this regard",
    "we note that one of the characteristic features of spherical scalar field critical collapse is that the `` central '' value of @xmath16 oscillates between specific extremal values @xmath91 ; clearly the anti - symmetric property of ( [ anti_ic ] ) allows no such oscillation .",
    "one might therefore expect that evolutions with this type of initial data might produce a qualitatively different critical solution than the spherically symmetric one .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ asym_ex ] , at threshold _ two _ spherical - like echoing solutions develop off - center at @xmath92 .",
    "second , we include the prolate family because the initial amplitude of the putative second unstable mode seems to be closely related to the prolateness of the initial distribution ( rather , for instance , than asymmetries in @xmath16 within an imploding spherical shell ) .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath71 in ( [ prolate_ic ] ) allows us to demonstrate the effect of adding more ( larger @xmath71 ) or less of the unstable mode .",
    "the axisymmetric instability , once it has grown beyond a certain amplitude , causes a near - spherical threshold solution to `` bifurcate '' into two echoing solutions , separated by some distance along the axis . as an example , figure [ prolate_1_4_ex ] shows several time - instants from the near - critical evolution of initial data with @xmath93 , transformed to logarithmic coordinates in space to better illustrate the self - similar nature of the initial critical behavior . note that this bifurcation is qualitatively different from the two echoing solutions observed in anti - symmetric collapse ",
    "there , by construction , no self - similar behavior is seen about @xmath67 , and there are two ( out of phase ) echoing solutions from the beginning . furthermore , the initial separation of the two ( in phase ) echoing solutions arising from a bifurcation is related to the smallest length scale that developed in the single , origin - centered echoer prior to the bifurcation .",
    "in contrast , the separation of the two anti - symmetric echoing solutions is related to a length scale in the initial data .",
    "moreover , if there really is a second unstable mode , then each of the anti - symmetric echoers should also be subject to that instability and eventually bifurcate , and we do see some evidence for this .     from the evolution of near - critical , anti - symmetric initial data ( [ anti_ic ] ) .",
    "the figures span the first several half - echoes of the local self - similar solutions , and the particular times shown correspond to when the scalar field reaches a local minima / maxima .",

    "the growth of the instability is sufficiently small that after 3 echoes we do not yet see a bifurcation for @xmath106 ; for @xmath93 and @xmath104 we see a bifurcation after approximately @xmath20 and @xmath107 @xmath108 echoes respectively .",

    ", in an adaptive scheme there is no single scale @xmath138 ; however , individual grids within the hierarchy do admit richardson expansions , and hence we can loosely think of ( [ lambda_exp ] ) holding over the hierarchy with some effective @xmath138 that would be related to the maximum truncation error estimate @xmath121 . in @xcite , the real part of the largest eigenvalue of any non - spherical mode perturbing the critical solution",

    "this magnitude of decay is about 100 times smaller than the growth rate of the dominant spherically symmetric mode , that has @xmath144 .",
    "thus , looking at ( [ lambda_exp ] ) , it is certainly plausible that in a numerical scheme , even if @xmath138 were small enough to reasonably accurately model the dominant feature of a solution ( as we evidently are from the comparison in figure [ cent_phi_1d ] ) , it might still be large enough to significantly affect sub - dominant features of the solution , such as a small @xmath135 in ( [ lambda_exp ] ) .",
    "we should then be able to see a significant effect when changing @xmath138 ; however , in figure [ ma_ssb ] , even though the initial amplitude of the asymmetry decreases as @xmath121 decreases ( as expected ) , the apparent growth rate that we obtain , namely @xmath145 , does not noticeably change within the relatively large uncertainty of the measurement by assuming exponential growth between adjacent , local maxima of the plots in figure [ ma_ssb ] ( and [ ma_1_3 ] later on ) , and then averaging the growth rate found over the number of half - echoes where the growth is clearly visible ( so unfortunately with @xmath120 data , the more accurate the solution with smaller @xmath121 , the fewer data points we have to estimate the growth ) . ] . on the other hand , we may still be too far from the convergent regime to measure @xmath146 ( so that higher order terms in ( [ lambda_exp ] ) are still important ) .",
    "note that we also can not conclusively say that the growing mode we see has a pure @xmath10 angular dependence , but it appears that the @xmath10 mode is at least an order of magnitude larger than any of the other asymmetric modes we find in the spectral decomposition .",
    "however , it must be noted that for computations with any of the three values of @xmath121 adopted we use 50 points in @xmath147 along which we integrate null curves , and so do not have good accuracy for determining the higher @xmath148 modes .    in figure [ ma_1_3 ] below",

    "this value of @xmath71 is the smallest , _ non - zero _ value considered that clearly shows growth of the asymmetry during the roughly three self - similar echoes of evolution ; in the @xmath150 and @xmath151 cases , early - time evolution of the @xmath10 spectral component is dominated by decaying modes . for the @xmath149 data in figure [ ma_1_3 ] we apparently _ are _ converging to the growth shown ; i.e. as was the case for the spherically symmetric initial data , the growth does not appear to be truncation error dominated .",
    "estimates of the growth rate from the simulation with the smallest value of @xmath121 gives @xmath152 .",
    "however , this is quite a rough estimate as we can not disentangle the supposed growing mode from the full spectrum of @xmath10 modes contributing to the plot shown in figure [ ma_1_3 ] .",
    "although we appear to be converging to a growth of the asymmetry in the @xmath149 case , and to a bifurcation for the @xmath93 case , this does not necessarily prove that the spherically symmetric critical solution has a second unstable mode .",
    "these families are sufficiently aspherical that one can imagine that the bifurcation is due to some artifact of the initial data  in particular a `` focusing '' effect , as the wave front of an imploding , prolate distribution of the scalar field will tend to focus to two locations on the axis , above and below the origin .",
    "if this is the case though , it is rather surprising that we see self - similar collapse occur about a single center _",
    "prior _ to the bifurcation .",

    "the graph indicates similar growth rates independent of the effective resolution . in order to better show the similarity of the growth rates , the data for the higher truncation error thresholds",
    "have been shifted along the horizontal axis which labels logarithmic central proper time ( about @xmath153 for the @xmath154 case and @xmath155 for the @xmath156 data ) .",

    "the horizontal axis labels the logarithmic central proper time when the given outgoing null surface intersects the origin .",
    "note the different vertical scales when comparing this plot to the similar one for @xmath120 in figure [ ma_ssb ] ( and we have _ not _ shifted the data here).,width=330 ]    finally , in figure [ l2_comp ] , we show comparisons of the `` radial '' profile of the @xmath10 spherical harmonic component of @xmath16 , measured along an outgoing null geodesic at ( approximately ) the same time within a self - similar echo and anti - symmetric cases , and the second maxima for the @xmath149 case  see figure [ cent_phi ] ) ] , for the @xmath157 and anti - symmetric near - critical solutions ( with @xmath158 ) . in the plot ,",
    "the overall amplitude and affine distance along each null curve is rescaled so that the maximum amplitude is one , and occurs at one in rescaled affine time @xmath159 .",
    "that the curves from these representative families do approximately agree provides additional evidence that we are seeing a _ unique _ , asymmetric unstable mode .",
    "( @xmath124 ) spherical harmonic component of @xmath16 , measured along an outgoing null geodesic starting from similar times within a ( chosen ) self - similar oscillation of the @xmath160 and anti - symmetric near critical solutions ( from @xmath158 simulations ) . to facilitate comparison , we have rescaled the amplitude of each curve so that the maximum is 1 , and rescaled the affine parameter ( labeled @xmath159 ) along the null curves so that the first maxima of each is at @xmath161 . ,",
    "we have presented results from a first study of scalar field critical collapse in axisymmetry in the fully non - linear regime .",
    "we find that critical phenomena is observed at the threshold of gravitational collapse of several families of asymmetric initial data .",
    "the critical solution that unfolds at threshold can ( locally ) be described as the spherically symmetric critical solution found in @xcite , with asymmetric perturbations . however ,",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite , we find some evidence that a single @xmath10 spherical harmonic perturbation does _ not _ decay with time ; rather it grows at a rate of roughly @xmath162 the magnitude of the dominant , spherically symmetric unstable mode .",
    "the nature of this second unstable mode is such that it causes a self - similar threshold solution , with some asymmetry in it , to eventually bifurcate into two local , self similar solutions that again resemble the spherical threshold spacetime .",
    "if this second instability is indeed a property of the spherically symmetric critical solution , then presumably one ( or both if the initial data has reflection symmetry ) of the new self - similar solutions would bifurcate again , and so on , resulting in an infinite , `` random walk '' of bifurcations on ever decreasing scales . thus the second instability would not completely destroy the universal nature of generic ( axisymmetric ) critical collapse , but rather would alter it in an intriguing , family dependent manner .    to conclusively answer 1 )",
    "whether there _ is _ a second unstable mode , and if so 2 ) how the bifurcation ultimately affects the threshold solution , is beyond the capabilities of our current code .",
    "first , we are using double precision arithmetic , and this prohibits us from tuning closer than @xmath107 part in @xmath103 of the threshold . because the echoing exponent of the spherically symmetric solution is ( relatively speaking ) so large , @xmath107 part in @xmath103 can only give us about three , complete self - similar echoes .",
    "this is far from ideal when trying to estimate the growth ( or decay ) rate of a mode that may have an e - folding time on the order of 10 - 20 echoes .",
    "second , we would like to achieve higher accuracy than we have been able to attain so far . to do this with the current code",
    "will require that we parallelize it because we have already reached the practical limits ( in terms of memory usage and runtime ) imposed by the hardware to which we have access .",
    "alternatively , one could write a code adapted to the spherical critical solution ( for instance using spherical polar coordinates with a logarithmic radial coordinate ) .",
    "this would allow one to obtain greater resolution , with a given amount of resources , than what we can achieve with our more general purpose cylindrical coordinates .",
    "of course , spherical polar coordinates would not be well suited to following a solution beyond a bifurcation , but it should be adequate to study the growth or decay of perturbations . +",
