    "stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) is a nonlinear process by which light interacts coherently with acoustic vibrations in an optically transparent medium  @xcite .",
    "predicted by brillouin in 1922  @xcite , sbs was first experimentally demonstrated by chiao , townes and stoicheff soon after the invention of the laser  @xcite , and thereafter became one of the standard techniques for measuring the mechanical properties of materials at high frequencies  @xcite .",
    "sbs has historically often been regarded as a non - desirable side - effect that must be either suppressed or accommodated , for example in fiber optics , where it can strongly deplete narrow - band pumps .",
    "however in recent years there has been a remarkable resurgence of interest in guided wave sbs  @xcite , driven largely by the ability to harness the effect in modern nanophotonics experiments  @xcite .",
    "as well as forming the basis for the investigation of fundamental physical effects such as slow - light  @xcite and non - reciprocity @xcite , these experiments have led to a number of interesting sbs - based applications , such as narrow - linewidth tunable sources  @xcite , as well as on - chip processing of optical  @xcite and radio - frequency  @xcite signals .",
    "sbs is closely related to the field of opto - mechanics  @xcite , which is a similarly dynamic aera of research  @xcite .",
    "the sbs interaction arises from a pair of physical mechanisms that transfer energy back and forth between the electromagnetic field and the mechanical stresses and strains of the material  @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms can be categorized as _ scattering _ ( or forward - action ) processes , by which the acoustic modes scatter light from one state to another , and _ back - action _ ( or force - like ) processes , by which the optical field generates mechanical motion via optical forces and pressures . informed by the understanding of fiber and bulk systems , it was thought until very recently that sbs was driven entirely by the photoelasticity and electrostriction .",
    "these are inverse scattering and back - action processes respectively , linked by the thermodynamics of dielectric materials under mechanical strain .",
    "however these mechanisms are not the only possibilities for optomechanical interaction : in particular in the field of nano - optomechanics it is known that the back - action of radiation pressure can be very large in small , high - refractive - index - contrast devices , with the effect playing a central role in the interaction between optical and acoustic resonators in a number of seminal experiments in this field@xcite . in recent work rakich  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that radiation pressure can also make a significant contribution to the sbs gain : this is the result of large optical forces that act on the boundaries of suspended waveguides and resonantly excite acoustic modes of the free - standing structure .",
    "this prediction has important implications for the harnessing of sbs in cmos - compatible materials such as silicon , in which electrostriction is relatively weak .",
    "radiation pressure is strongest for small , high index contrast waveguides , and radiation - pressure - induced sbs has recently been observed in a silicon / silicon nitride hybrid waveguide  @xcite .    in this recent work and in the associated literature",
    "@xcite , the scattering of the optical mode by the acoustic field is not considered directly ; instead the phonon generation rate is computed by summing the optical forces due to both radiation pressure and electrostriction acting on the waveguide , and the sbs gain is then obtained via particle conservation in the classical limit . while this is a valid approach ,",
    "there are several subtleties that arise in the physics that are not explicitly discussed in the existing literature .",
    "the main difficulty with this force - based approach is that force - like terms arise in such a way as to make it unclear whether they should be included or not . in sbs",
    "this is most clearly manifested in the form of an electrostrictive pressure term that appears on the boundary  @xcite : it is not entirely obvious whether this pressure term should be separately included , or whether it is simply a manifestation of the radiation pressure and already contained in the divergence of maxwell s stress tensor across a material boundary . in a similar way",
    ", the radiation pressure can appear to give rise to a body force  @xcite in addition to the familiar surface terms , and it is unclear whether this body force should be included separately or whether it is readily contained in the electrostrictive process .",
    "these questions are not easy to answer ; indeed the appropriate separation of optical forces in materials is related to the proper form of the photon momentum within material , and this has been a realm of some debate ( known as the abraham - minkowski controversy ) for the past hundred years . given this uncertainty ,",
    "the question arises not only as to which forces to include in one s calculations , but whether there exist further force - like terms that are yet to be discovered .",
    "our approach to resolve these issues is to avoid optical forces as much as possible and found our description on the forward - action processes , which are not controversial .",
    "these processes include the scattering of light via the photo - elastic effect , scattering due to deformations of the waveguide boundary , as well as any other process whereby mechanical motion can influence the electromagnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the forward - action half of the sbs interaction is important for any experiment in which the stimulated acoustic wave acts on other optical fields that are also present in the waveguide , as occurs in the generation of frequency combs via sbs  @xcite or in sbs - based optical isolation  @xcite .",
    "perhaps more critically , scattering mechanisms form an important part of the physics of sbs , and a theory that discusses these explicitly can not only shed light on the physicality of back - action processes , but is necessary to complete our understanding of brillouin processes in integrated photonic waveguides . here we present a new formalism for sbs that considers all interactions in a unified way . by considering scattering mechanisms explicitly ,",
    "we derive expressions for the interaction that do not rely on the exact form of the optical forces between and within materials .",
    "a main result of this formalism is the classification of forward and back - action processes into interaction pairs : for example we show that motion of the waveguide boundary forms the inverse process to the radiation pressure between lossless dielectrics , just as the photoelastic effect is associated with the electrostrictive force .",
    "we also identify a new term in the sbs interaction that results from coupling between the moving dielectric and the magnetic part of the optical mode .",
    "furthermore , we observe that optical losses are related to irreversible forces using the case of radiation pressure as an example ; this breaks the aforementioned symmetry between the scattering and back - action processes .",
    "finally , we derive coupled mode equations that include all of these effects in a consistent framework . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first such treatment in the literature .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we state the properties of the systems under investigation and the expansion bases for the optical and acoustic wave propagation . in section",
    "[ sec : modal_optical ] , we formulate a conventional modal expansion and , more importantly , state the terms that describe the three scattering mechanisms of optical modes due to an acoustic displacement field in the waveguide s bulk , on its surface and due to by the acoustic velocity field .",
    "these are all first - order terms that are present under our preliminaries . in section  [ sec : modal_acoustic ] , we again formulate a conventional modal expansion and then show based on a lagrangian picture that for reversible interactions  and only for those  the coupling constant for the excitation of acoustic modes coincides with the previously formulated optical scattering constant .",
    "this provides a complete description of sbs that is independent of expressions for the optical forces and , hence , independent of the abraham - minkowski controversy . in section  [ sec : discussion ] finally , we show how to derive the common resonant expression for the sbs - gain of a long waveguide and state limits for its applicability , we show that the coupled mode model as presented conserves energy and finally we discuss how the acousto - optic expressions that arise from our treatment are compatible with an expression for the optical momentum fluxes . in this context",
    ", we also explicitly comment on electrostrictive surface pressures .",
    "we consider the interaction between optical and acoustic fields in waveguides having the general form depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] , with a material cross section that is invariant along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "we make no assumptions on the shape of the waveguide , save that it is capable of guiding light in at least one optical mode . for the materials we assume the absence of magnetic response ( @xmath1 ) and we disregard loss and dispersion in the dielectric parameters .",
    "we do so mainly to simplify the disucssion in section  [ sec : thermo ] ; the effect of dispersion and loss on the optical pulse shape can be easily incorporated in the same way as we introduce acoustic loss in section  [ sec : modal_acoustic ] .",
    "furthermore , we neglect the effect of any nonlinearity apart from the brillouin scattering process that we investigate ; specifically , we exclude piezoelectric materials .",
    "the exclusion of material dispersion is justified by the very small frequency shifts that occur in sbs , which are typically of only a few ghz . a material",
    "whose permittivity changes appreciably over this frequency range would probably be too lossy to be used as a material for a waveguide .",
    "if desired , weak dielectric loss can be incorporated in the mode expansion in the same way as we incorporate weak acoustic loss ( see section  [ sec : modal_acoustic ] ) . throughout this work",
    ", we use si units .",
    "although a specific waveguide cross - section is shown here , the results apply to waveguides of arbitrary cross section and composition . ]",
    "we describe the evolution of the optical fields by the electromagnetic wave equation in terms of the electric field @xmath2 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electric field and electric induction field respectively , and @xmath5 denotes the partial derivative with respect to time . in the context of acousto - optics",
    ", we prefer the term `` electric induction field '' over `` electric displacement field '' to avoid confusion with the mechanical displacement field . later on",
    ", we also use the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the dielectric function @xmath7 is isotropic and homogeneous in the @xmath8 is the position vector .",
    "we assume that the electromagnetic fields can be approximated as a superposition of two propagating optical eigenmodes @xmath9 with frequencies @xmath10 and wave vectors @xmath11 .",
    "note that the propagation constants @xmath12 may be both positive or negative .",
    "the dimensionless envelope functions @xmath13 are assumed to change only slowly over an optical wavelength and the time scale of an optical cycle .",
    "the other fields @xmath4 and @xmath6 are likewise expanded .",
    "the basis functions @xmath14 are bound solutions to the 2d - eigenproblem @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nabla operator in the @xmath17-plane .",
    "there is no need to normalize these modes , although there may be practical advantages in doing so in numerical simulations . since we neglect dispersion , the average electromagnetic energy density per unit length of the waveguide and the corresponding energy flux carried by the unnormalized mode functions are  @xcite @xmath18^\\ast \\cdot { { { { \\bf{e}}}}^{(i ) } } ;    \\\\    { { { { \\mathcal{p}}}}^{(i ) } } = &     2 \\int { { \\rm{d}}}^2 r \\ { \\hat{\\rm z}}\\cdot ( [ { { { { \\bf{e}}}}^{(i)}}]^\\ast \\times { { { { \\bf{h}}}}^{(i)}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration is across the whole transverse plane . using maxwell s equations ,",
    "the latter can be recast to an expression that only involves the electric field ; the energy transport velocity of the mode ( which in the lossless case here is equal to its group velocity )  @xcite is given by the ratio of the energy flux and energy densities : @xmath19^\\ast \\cdot [ { \\hat{\\rm z}}\\times ( \\nabla \\times { { { { \\bf{e}}}}^{(i ) } } ) ]     \\\\    & \\quad +    [ { { { { \\bf{e}}}}^{(i)}}]^\\ast \\cdot [ \\nabla \\times ( { \\hat{\\rm z}}\\times { { { { \\bf{e}}}}^{(i ) } } ) ]    \\big\\ } \\label{eq : emflux }    \\\\ \\label{eq : emvg }    { { v}^{(i ) } } = & { { { { \\mathcal{p}}}}^{(i ) } } / { { { { \\mathcal{e}}}}^{(i)}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the fundamental equation for the mechanical part of the problem is the acoustic wave equation  @xcite for the ( mechanical ) displacement field @xmath20 @xmath21    { \\partial}_k u_l = -f_i ,    \\label{eqn : ac_wave_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the density , @xmath23 is the stiffness tensor and @xmath24 is the viscosity tensor . here , @xmath25 denotes the spatial derivative in the @xmath26-th spatial direction along @xmath26 , where . the source term @xmath27 on the right hand side is the driving external force field per unit volume through which the coupling to the electromagnetic field will be introduced . assuming first that the acoustic losses are weak , we express the displacement field in terms of a solution @xmath28 with carrier @xmath29 to the lossless wave equation ( with @xmath30 ) with a corresponding dimensionless envelope function  @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an eigenmode of the equation @xmath34",
    "note that we need not assume that the acoustic modes are strictly bound , since significant sbs can occur with leaky acoustic modes  @xcite .",
    "however , we assume that the acoustic propagation loss is small so that it appears to first approximation in the equation of motion for @xmath31 .",
    "the first main advantage of this approach ( moving the loss into the dynamics ) is that the set of functions from which we choose @xmath28 is formed by eigenfunctions to a hermitian operator resulting in convenient orthogonality relations .",
    "second , @xmath35 is related to the amplitude of the acoustic field in a straight - forward way throughout the whole system and so is directly related to the acoustic energy density . again , there is no need to normalize the acoustic basis function . for what follows ,",
    "the acoustic wave is chosen to be phase - matched with the beat between the two optical modes , we specify for the rest of this paper that @xmath36 note that such conditions are not in general automatically satisfied if the two electric fields are chosen freely .",
    "there must also be an appropriate resonant , phase - matched acoustic mode to provide the coupling .",
    "this strict phase - matching condition is used to select appropriate basis functions for the subsequent modal expansion .",
    "the energy density of the acoustic field is the sum of the kinetic and the elastic energy . for a traveling wave ,",
    "we focus on the time - averaged total energy per unit length of the waveguide  @xcite . for an acoustic mode with unit envelope",
    "@xmath37 it thus reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the strain tensor and the subscript @xmath40 indicates that the average is taken over a time window that is much longer than one acoustic cycle but shorter than the time scale for any relevant slower process .",
    "the transverse integral extends over the interior cross - section of the waveguide . if , as is typically the case , the waveguide s total momentum and angular momentum are both zero , the average kinetic energy is equal to the average elastic energy and we may simplify : @xmath41 the time - averaged energy flux that traverses the waveguide cross section @xmath42 is given as the normal projection of the product between the velocity field and the stress tensor @xmath43  @xcite ; the mode s energy transport velocity @xmath44 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emvg ] ) : @xmath45    finally , we assume that the coupling mechanism between optical and mechanical modes is reversible , that energy is lost only by the propagation of modes but not by the conversion between them .",
    "this means we neglect for example the optical force that occurs due to absorption of light .",
    "we comment on this in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we derive the equations of motion for the optical envelope functions @xmath13 and examine the two main effects by which a sound wave can scatter energy from one optical mode into the other .",
    "the mechanical deformation affects the electromagnetic field in two ways .",
    "first , it changes the value of the permittivity .",
    "this is known as the photoelastic effect .",
    "second , the material boundaries can be displaced and do work on the fields , an effect for which no familiar name seems to exist , but which we refer to as moving boundary scattering . in either case , the deformation leads to time - dependent changes @xmath46 , @xmath47 in the electric field and induction , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_patterns ] .",
    "furthermore , we allow for an additional magnetization @xmath48 due to the motion of polarized particles . in formulating the problem in this way",
    ", we go beyond similar prior descriptions of sbs  @xcite .",
    "the distorted fields are still solutions of maxwell s equations and so satisfy the wave equation @xmath49 the field perturbations contain contributions with all possible sum and difference frequencies , but only those perturbations that simultaneously match the spatial and temporal frequency of a basis function ( are phase - matched to a basis function ) are relevant for what follows .",
    "thus , we neglect all but the phase - matched contributions @xmath50 each one of the thus far unspecified patterns @xmath51 contains the corresponding optical wave carrier : @xmath52 the other field perturbations @xmath47 and @xmath48 are treated likewise .",
    "we have explicitly assumed that the field perturbations that are phase - matched to one optical mode stem from the interaction between the other optical mode and the sound wave and that they are linear in both fields . to proceed ,",

    "the only source of entropy is the mechanical loss , which can be neglected because of the very small acoustic amplitudes in sbs .",

    "typically , the mechanical contribution to the free energy of a solid body is separated into boundary terms ( surface pressures ) and interior density - like terms ( internal stress )  @xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : epe_body_force ] ) are the only body forces inside a lossless dielectric .",
    "it is not surprising that this is the expression for electrostrictive coupling , because photoelasticity and electrostriction are connected via a maxwell relation .",
    "in this paper , we have formulated the dynamics of sbs in a coupled mode framework . based on energy considerations , we have established connections between the nonlinear coupling coefficients that mediate the interplay of optical and acoustic eigenmodes in a waveguide . in this context , the connection between scattering of optical eigenmodes due to the motion of dielectric interfaces in conjunction with the electromagnetic continuity conditions on the one hand and the transverse radiation pressure on the other hand is a finding of some interest . we have also pointed out that irreversible forces are bound to appear in lossy waveguides and that these coupling terms form a qualitatively different contribution to the sbs gain .",
    "this finding may become relevant in the near future as people start to begin to consider metals in sbs - designs in order to further reduce the device dimensions .",
    "finally , we have shown how the miniaturization is challenged by the finite velocity of acoustic waves . again , this finding is of certain importance for the design of integrated sbs - devices .",
    "we are deeply indebted to gustavo wiederhecker for fruitful discussions . furthermore , we acknowledge financial support of the australian research council via discovery grant dp130100832 , its laureate fellowship ( prof .",
    "eggleton , fl120100029 ) program and the arc center of excellence cudos ( ce110001018 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we estimate the relevance of the magnetic coupling term described in section  [ sec : mag_photoelasticity ] . we base this on the expressions for the reciprocal optical force contributions as identified in section  [ sec : forces ] . the contribution from the magnetic coupling depends heavily on details of the structure , especially on the geometry and mode symmetry .",
    "thus , a discussion of its influence on the sbs - properties of specific designs for integrated optical waveguides is beyond the scope of this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of plane waves can be easily solved and is important to estimate the contribution of the magnetic part in measurements of the photoelastic parameters of a material based on acousto - optic methods .",
    "as we assume quasi - plane waves , we are dealing only with the bulk material , which we furthermore assume to be isotropic .",
    "finally , we assume backward - type sbs caused by the longitudinal acoustic wave . the force caused by the reciprocal process of the conventional electric photoelastic effect and by the reciprocal process of the dynamic , effective magnetic coupling effect",

    "<S> recent theoretical studies of stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) in nanoscale devices have led to an intense research effort dedicated to the demonstration and application of this nonlinearity in on - chip systems . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of sbs in integrated photonic waveguides is that small , high - contrast waveguides are predicted to experience powerful optical forces on the waveguide boundaries , which are predicted to further boost the sbs gain that is already expected to grow dramatically in such structures because of the higher mode confinement alone . in all recent treatments , the effect of radiation pressure is included separately from the scattering action that the acoustic field exerts on the optical field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this , we show here that the effects of radiation pressure and motion of the waveguide boundaries are inextricably linked . </S>",
    "<S> central to this insight is a new formulation of the sbs interaction that unifies the treatment of light and sound , incorporating all relevant interaction mechanisms  radiation pressure , waveguide boundary motion , electrostriction and photoelasticity  from a rigorous thermodynamic perspective . </S>",
    "<S> our approach also clarifies important points of ambiguity in the literature , such as the nature of edge - effects with regard to electrostriction , and of body - forces with respect to radiation pressure . </S>",
    "<S> this new perspective on brillouin processes leads to physical insight with implications for the design and fabrication of sbs - based nanoscale devices . </S>"
