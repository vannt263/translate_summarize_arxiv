    "over the last decade , it has become increasingly apparent that not only do supermassive black holes reside in the centres of all massive galactic bulges , but also that their ongoing evolution is strongly coupled , despite nine orders of magnitude difference between the relevant spatial scales of the black hole and its galactic host ( kormendy 1993 ; magorrian et al 1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al 2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; cattaneo & bernardi 2003 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "regardless of the physical driving mechanisms for these correlations , it is certain that understanding the periods of agn activity , when the central black hole is most able to grow via accretion , are of crucial importance for building up a cogent theoretical framework for galaxy evolution in general ( e.g. yu & tremaine 2002 , shankar et al 2004 , marconi et al 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "this problem poses two central , interlinked questions : what is the nature of an active galaxy , and how do they differ from the inactive population of galaxies from which they are ( presumably ) drawn ?",
    "extragalactic radio sources play a particularly important role in such studies .",
    "historically , they have been amongst the best studied distant agn , due to the ease with which large samples of such objects could be assembled out to large redshifts . under orientation - based unification schemes for radio galaxies and radio loud quasars ( e.g. barthel 1989 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) , they provided a perfect laboratory for studying the host galaxies of radio loud agn without the complicating presence of an unobscured bright quasar nucleus .",
    "additionally , the presence of extensive powerful radio emission directly links the behaviour of these systems from the small scales of the central accreting black hole out to many hundreds or thousands of kiloparsecs into the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "early studies of the proto - typical 3cr sources suggested that the host galaxies of these radio sources were members of a remarkably uniform population , and seemed to be `` standard candles '' to within @xmath5mag ( lilly & longair 1984 ) , with characteristic effective radii of up to 15kpc and ir magnitudes dominated by emission from an old stellar population formed at @xmath6 ( best et al 1998 ) .",
    "however , subsequent revisions to the most widely accepted cosmological model ( e.g. hinshaw et al 2009 ) and an improved understanding of structure formation in the universe ( e.g. springel et al 2005 ) add considerable complexity to this picture .    while a radio source _ may _ undergo several active phases ( e.g. haehnelt & rees 1993 ; saikia & jamrozy 2009 and references therein )",
    ", this does not imply that any given radio source would necessarily have been active in the past , or will be so again in the future .",
    "this opens up the scenario whereby radio galaxies at different epochs could be drawn from quite different galaxy populations : might this indeed be the case ?",
    "the tightness of the @xmath7 relation ( e.g. inskip et al 2002 ; willott et al 2003 ; rocca - volmerange et al 2004 ) and the total near - ir luminosities of their host galaxies ( seymour et al 2007 ) suggest that radio sources are hosted by a relatively homogeneous , high mass ( up to @xmath8 ) population of galaxies over a wide redshift range . even at higher redshifts , while morphological studies have shown that some sources are still undergoing active assembly , radio source host galaxies at redshifts of @xmath9 are in general similar in size to those nearby ( e.g. van breugel et al 1998 , pentericci et al 2001 ) .",
    "however , the increased luminosity of high - redshift radio galaxies relative to passive evolution models goes against the simplest picture of closed - box evolution of a single population of galaxies .    the high mass of radio source host galaxies at all epochs provides an additional constraint . since @xmath10 ,",
    "the most massive members of the elliptical galaxy population have shown little evolution in mass ( e.g. heavens et al 2004 ; thomas et al 2005 ) .",
    "although subsequent episodes of agn activity in massive galaxies could be triggered by minor mergers or galaxy interactions which lead to little additional change in galaxy mass , the links between periods of black hole accretion and galaxy growth ( as evidenced by the black hole mass vs. bulge mass relation ) limits the ability of such objects to repeatedly host powerful , high accretion - rate agn in more recent cosmic epochs .",
    "on top of this , it has been theorised that the very presence of a powerful radio source and/or agn can limit the potential for further galaxy growth , via heating of the local environment ( e.g. fabian et al 2000 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ; croton & farrar 2008 ; de young 2010 ) .",
    "equally , the actively accreting lower - redshift systems have likely been assembled from their less - massive constituent progenitor objects too recently to have hosted powerful agn at high redshifts .",
    "similarly , at different redshifts the powerful radio source population samples different environments ( e.g. lilly & prestage 1987 ; yates et al 1989 ; hill & lilly 1991 ; best 2000 ) , with a tendency towards more highly clustered objects at higher redshifts .",
    "it is now clear that galaxies are subject to so - called `` cosmic downsizing '' , by which both star formation ( e.g. cowie et al 1996 ; juneau et al 2005 ) and agn activity ( e.g. granato et al 2004 ; de lucia et al 2006 , croton et al 2006 ; merloni & heinz 2008 ; martini et al 2009 ; shen 2009 ) become increasingly more prevalent in lower - mass objects at later cosmic epochs , and in less dense environments .",
    "the inherent changes in the host galaxy population highlight the essential need to effectively characterise their properties at all redshifts . without a clear handle on what a radio galaxy _",
    "is _ at any given epoch , it is practically impossible to determine how it may or may not differ from the underlying inactive galaxy population , or from the population of radio - quiet agn .",
    "what are the characteristic sizes of powerful radio galaxies , and how does this parameter vary with redshift and/or radio power ? is the scatter in the @xmath7 relation solely due to variations in galaxy mass , or can it be accounted for at least in part by variations in the host galaxy stellar populations ?",
    "do the host galaxies show signs of recent merger activity , and how does the proportion of merging / disturbed sources compare with that of normal galaxies ?",
    "is there any dependence of galaxy morphology on local environment , or on the radio source / agn properties ?",
    "with such physical characteristics of the host galaxies pinned down , deeper questions may then be posed on the nature of _ how _ agn and radio source activity are triggered , e.g. : whether triggering occurs due to major or minor interactions or the more gradual infall of material ; the prevalence of different triggering modes ; the details of the timeline of events involved and any timelags between star formation and agn / radio source activity ; and the links between such processes and the evolution and observed morphological characteristics of the host galaxies .    in order to investigate these issues , we turn not to the 3cr sample , but instead to the similarly well studied 2jy sample of southern radio sources at @xmath11 ( tadhunter et al 1993 , morganti et al 1993 ) .",
    "this sample is unique in the sense that it is the _ only _ major sample of powerful radio galaxies for which complete , high quality optical continuum and emission line spectra , as well as radio imaging data , exist for all the objects , alongside near- and mid - ir imaging and spectroscopy for most sources .",
    "one particular advantage of this sample is that the combination of the mid - ir data and optical spectra allows us to separately determine the extent of both obscured and unobscured star formation activity within the host galaxies , as well as providing two independent measures of the degree of nuclear activity ( via the 24@xmath12 m emission and the optical line emission ) .",
    "our current dataset consists of ground - based near - ir imaging of the majority of the sample objects .",
    "these data will be used to obtain accurate photometric magnitudes , and to thoroughly characterise the host galaxy structural properties as observed in this wavelength regime ( galaxy profile , effective radius and the extent of any nuclear point source contamination from the agn ) , and how they compare to other radio galaxy samples .",
    "we will also make a preliminary assessment of the prevalance of visible merger activity within the sample ( either ongoing or having occured in the recent past ) ; this issue is expanded on in our analysis of optical imaging data for the 2jy sample ( ramos almeida et al in prep , hereafter ra10 ) .",
    "having characterised the morphological properties of the host galaxies , in paper 2 of this series we will extend our investigation to the more global properties of the sample . by combining galaxy morphologies with our data on the host galaxy stellar populations , the results of the current paper will be used to investigate the nature of the scatter in the @xmath7 relation , and how well it can be accounted for in terms of galaxy mass and recent star formation activity .",
    "we will also use literature data for other radio galaxy surveys at higher redshift to examine how redshift and radio power impact on the observed trends .",
    "finally , together with the results of ra10 , we will assess in paper 2 how closely morphological signatures of merger activity correlate with the degree of recent star formation , the host galaxy morphologies , and the size / age of the radio source , helping us to build a clearer picture of the variety of different physical modes of agn triggering in these sources .",
    "further to this work , these data will also be used in conjunction with the existing optical data ( ra10 ) to also constrain the local environments of the host galaxies ( ramos almeida et al , in prep ) , and to comprehensively assess the impact of environment on the properties of powerful radio sources and their host galaxies .    in section 2",
    ", we provide details of our observed sample .",
    "our observations and data reduction processes are described in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we present our observational results and our 2-d modelling of the host galaxies , while our discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "a more extensive analysis of this dataset is postponed to a second paper in this series .    throughout this paper , we assume cosmological parameters of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the sample of galaxies studied in this paper has been selected from the 2jy sample of wall & peacock ( 1985 ) which has flux densities @xmath16jy and declinations @xmath17 , with the addition of pks0347 + 05 which was later found to meet the same criteria ( di serego - alighieri et al 1994 ) .",
    "optical classifications have been determined for these objects on the basis of previous optical spectroscopic observations ( tadhunter et al 1998 ) and their optical appearance ( wall & peacock 1985 ) .",
    "sources with [ oiii]@xmath185007 emission line equivalent widths @xmath19  are classified as weak line radio galaxies ( wlrgs ) .",
    "the remainder are classified as narrow line radio galaxies ( nlrgs ) , broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) and quasars .",
    "the quasars were classified by wall & peacock ( 1985 ) on the basis of their stellar appearance on optical images , while the nlrgs and blrgs are classified according to whether or not their optical spectra show evidence for broad line emission .",
    "our sample excludes sources optically - classified as quasars , and was primarily selected within the redshift range @xmath20 and with right ascensions of @xmath21 . due to the availability of observing time on different instruments , this",
    "was later extended to redshifts of @xmath22 within the right ascension range of @xmath23 , and @xmath20 within the ranges @xmath24 and @xmath25 . of the resulting sample of 46 sources",
    ", we have obtained observations of 43 .",
    "pks0620 - 52 was dropped from the sample due to its proximity to the bright star canopus , while pks1839 - 48 was lost due to observing time constraints .",
    "pks1954 - 55 is known to have a bright foreground star in close proximity to its nucleus , and was also excluded . despite not reaching 100% completeness ,",
    "this sample is a representative , unbiased 93% complete subset of the whole .",
    "the ukirt observations were carried out on 2004 september 13 , 2004 september 14 and 2004 september 15 using ufti ( the ukirt fast  track imager ; roche et al 2002 ) .",

    "march 15 and 2006 november 13 , using the son of isaac ( sofi ; moorwood , cuby & lidman 1998 ) instrument on the eso 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) , as part of the european southern observatory ( eso ) observing programmes 074.b-0296(a ) , 074.b-0296(b ) and 078.b-0500(a ) . on most nights the instrument was used in the small field mode , which results in a plate scale of 0.144 arcsec per pixel .",

    "details of the observing conditions are provided in table 1 , with further details of the sources observed and the individual exposure times listed in table 2 . generally , the observations of each source consisted of a number of 1 min exposures , with each observation subject to a random offset within a 40 arcsec diameter box .",
    "for the lower redshift objects in our sample ( typically those with @xmath285 ) we switched to five 1 min integrations at fixed offsets .",
    "the data were corrected for sofi s interquadrant row cross talk effect using an adapted version of the sofi crosstalk.cl iraf script .",
    "flat - fielding of the data was carried out using the following process : all target frames were combined , median filtered and normalised to a mean pixel value of 1.0 to create a first - pass flat - field image , which was then applied to each frame .",
    "bright objects on the flat - fielded images were then masked out , and the process repeated with the masked frames , allowing the data to be cleanly flat fielded without any contamination from stars or galaxies .",
    "the subsequent data reduction uses well - established techniques : the flat - fielded data were sky - subtracted and combined using the iraf package dimsum .",
    "flux calibration used observations of nicmos photometric standard stars ( persson et al 1998 ) .",
    "aperture photometry , galactic extinction corrections and uncertainties for the resulting magnitudes were determined in the same way as for the ufti observations .    the observations carried out on the nights of 2004 november 15 and 2005 february 26 were unfortunately subject to the presence of variable patchy cirrus at the start and the end of the night .",
    "regular observations of standard stars and good knowledge of the instrumental zero point based on the previous night s observations allowed us to keep track of which sources were observed in partially non - photometric conditions , and the changing extent of the extinction due to thin clouds .",
    "as an example , the bulk of our observations of pks0023 - 26 were obtained in non - photometric conditions .",
    "( note that the use of repeated standard star observations confirmed that some of the observations made of this object were obtained in clear transparancy conditions . )",
    "this presents several challenges .",
    "firstly , due to the strongly varying sky background level , the data are no longer best reduced in time - sequence order , such that sky subtraction is carried out for each frame based on the mean sky level of the frames immediately preceding and following the observation . instead ,",
    "the data are re - stacked in order of background sky brightness , and sky subtraction is carried out based on the mean sky background of the frames closest in sky luminosity .",
    "this procedure results in a high - quality final data product indistinguishable from one obtained in better observing conditions , which would not be the case for the more standard mode of sky subtraction . secondly , while the non - photometric data are still useful for morphological studies , simple combination of frames with equal weighting does not result in the best signal - to - noise level for the final image .",
    "we therefore monitor the flux of bright objects and the background noise level in each frame , and our final image is produced from a weighted combination of individual frames according to the signal - to - noise level applicable for each .",
    "monitoring the flux level of bright objects in each frame is also of great importance for selecting any frames which may be free of extinction due to cirrus , particularly for the stars with 2mass magnitudes available within the instrumental field of view . in the case of pks0023 - 26 ,",
    "the final five frames obtained were identified as being free of extinction , and combined together to make a photometric - equivalent final product separate from that used for our analaysis of the galaxy morphologies . for pks0213 - 132 ,",
    "even the best frames were not obtained in clear transparency conditions , but from examination of 2mass object fluxes we have confirmed the extinction level at 1.2 magnitudes for these frames , and applied the appropriate correction to the derived magnitudes .    for the data obtained on the night of 2004 november 15 ,",
    "the bulk of the sources were observed under clear - transparency conditions . for most of the remainder ,",
    "either reliable photometric - equivalent images were produced , or further data were obtained .",
    "photometric observations of pks0404 + 03 were obtained on 2005 february 28 , while photometric observations of pks0806 - 10 and pks0625 - 35 were obtained on 2006 november 13 .",
    "for the two outstanding sources observed only under non - photometric conditions , standard star fluxes and the variation of 2mass object fluxes within the observational fields of view confirm that the observations of pks0055 - 01 and pks0043 - 42 were subject to a stable extinction of @xmath286magnitudes and @xmath287magnitudes respectively .",
    "this , along with an associated estimate of the error on the extinction due to thin cirrus , has been accounted for in our photometry of these sources .",
    "infrared ks - band imaging observations of nine sources in our sample were carried out on 2005 july 12 and 2005 july 13 using the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ; moorwood et al 1998 ) as part of the european southern observatory ( eso ) observing programme 075.b-0674(a ) .",
    "isaac is mounted on the nasmyth b focus of the ut1 antu unit of the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",

    "we used a nine - point jitter pattern for these observations , and the data were reduced and flux - calibrated using the same process as for our sofi observations .",
    "aperture photometry , galactic extinction corrections and uncertainties for the resulting magnitudes were determined in the same way as for our other observations .",
    "limited observations of three sources were obtained from the eso archive .    for pks0039 - 44 , four photometric 10s spectroscopic acquisition observations ( from program 075.b-0777(a ) ) taken on the night of 2005 august 18",
    "using the sofi instrument on the ntt are available .",
    "while the total exposure time is too brief for the observations to be of use for morphological studies , they are still useful for determining a galaxy magnitude .    although we observed pks0915 - 11 on the night of 15 november 2004 , none of our data for this source is photometric .",
    "we have obtained additional archival observations of this source ( from program 072.a-0549(a ) ) , consisting of 38 10@xmath2886s photometric exposures using the sofi instrument in the large field mode on the ntt on the night of 2003 december 13 .",
    "pks2104 - 25 had been previously observed on the night of 1999 april 14 using the sofi instrument in the large field mode on the ntt .",
    "these archive observations ( from program 63.o-0448(a ) , studying the cluster abell 3744 of which pks2104 - 25 is a member ) consist of 36 20@xmath2885s photometric exposures .",
    "however , due to the relatively small size of the random offsets used in the observational sequence for pks2104 - 25 relative to the size of the galaxies in the cluster observed , the outer regions of the radio source host galaxy are unavoidably oversubtracted as part of the data reduction process , and these data are not useable for our purposes .",
    "our observations make use of two different filters : the mauna kea broad - band @xmath0band filter in use with ufti on ukirt , and the shorter @xmath1band filter in use with sofi on the ntt and isaac on the vlt . broadly speaking , at low redshifts",
    "the numerical difference in magnitudes obtained in either filter is negligible , due to the comparable shapes of the seds of both galaxies and the zero - magnitude a0v reference star vega .",
    "however , for observations of higher redshift galaxies the situation becomes marginally more complex .",
    "due to the flattening of the galaxy sed as redshift increases , the redder emission which would be included in the full @xmath0band filter but not in the shorter @xmath1band filter increases in strength relative to the emission included in both filters .",
    "thus , the magnitude of a higher - redshift galaxy observed in the @xmath1band is numerically larger than the value obtained in the @xmath0band .",
    "we illustrate this effect in figure [ fig : kks]a , which displays the sed of an elliptical galaxy formed at a redshift of 10 and observed at redshifts ranging from 0.01 to 1.12 , alongside the two filter profiles and two scaled seds representative of vega , which ( in the vega - based magnitude system ) has a magnitude of zero in both bands . we have calculated the necessary numerical corrections which would need to be applied in order to convert a @xmath1band magnitude to a @xmath0band magnitude at the redshifts of all sources observed in the @xmath1filter ; these values are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : kks]b .",
    "we also apply these k - corrections to the cleaned 64kpc aperture photometry ( table 3 , column 6 ) , producing a consistent set of @xmath0band magnitudes for the whole sample ( table 3 , column 7 ) .",
    "also displayed in [ fig : kks]c and and [ fig : kks]d are similar plots illustrating the k - corrections which would be applicable to the mean sed of a quasar ( from richards et al 2006 ) at the same redshifts of interest ; these allow us to account for the minimal k - corrections of any modelled qso point source components found in the @xmath1band data .",
    "the results of our aperture photometry , carried out as described in section 3.1 , are tabulated in table 3 .",
    "the errors on our final k - corrected magnitudes range from 1.5% to 12% , and for over 70% of our sample the photometric error is below 5% .",
    "in addition to photometry we have also modelled the morphological properties of the sample galaxies , as detailed in the following sections .",
    "the aim of our modelling is not solely to derive an accurate model for each galaxy , but also one which is useful in a wider sense , allowing us to compare sources both within the sample and in the wider literature in a simple , consistent and transparent manner . in brief",
    ", our modelling process asks the following questions : how well can the host galaxy be described as ( a ) a pure de vaucouleurs elliptical ( i.e. a galaxy with an @xmath289 srsic ( 1968 ) profile}$ ] , where @xmath290 is the surface brightness at a radius of @xmath291 , @xmath292 is the srsic index , @xmath293 a numerical parameter which varies with @xmath292 , @xmath294 is the effective radius of the galaxy ( within which is contained half the light ) , and @xmath295 is the surface brightness at the effective radius . ] ) , ( b ) a combination of de vaucouleurs elliptical and an unresolved nuclear point source , and ( c ) a combination of an alternative srsic index profile and a nuclear point source , or more complex models as required .",
    "our modelling utilises galfit ( peng et al 2002 , version 3.0 peng et al 2010 ) , a well - documented two - dimensional fitting algorithm which allows the user to simultaneously fit a galaxy image with an arbitrary number of different model components , and thus to extract structural parameters of the galaxy .",
    "the model galaxy is convolved with a point spread function ( psf ) and , using the downhill - gradient levenberg - marquardt algorithm , is matched to the observational data via the minimisation of the @xmath296 statistic .    as the data for some objects",
    "have been obtained over the course of several nights and with different observing conditions , the point spread function for the combined data can be rather complex . we therefore derive point spread profiles for each object by extracting 2-d images of stars in the field of view of each source , normalizing to unit flux and taking an average profile weighted by the signal - to - noise of the component extracted stellar profiles .",
    "where the resulting psf data is still relatively noisy ( i.e. for approximately half of our sources ) , we then use galfit to model the psf as a combination of gaussian functions , resulting in a less noisy psf image with the same characteristic shape and fwhm .",
    "this process results in an appropriate , high - quality point spread function for each of our sample objects , regardless of the observing conditions or availability of bright stars in the field of view .",
    "the host galaxies of our sample objects are modelled over an area equivalent to a 100kpc @xmath288 100kpc box on the plane of the sky at the redshift of the source in question . alongside the morphological parameters of the host galaxy",
    ", our galfit modelling is also intended to determine the percentage contamination by any unresolved nuclear point source emission from the agn . as demonstrated by pierce et al ( 2010 ) , even a low level of agn contamination",
    "can substantially affect the derived morphological parameters if it is left unaccounted for .",
    "as our data span a wide range of magnitudes and spatial resolutions , it is also important to consider how well we can disentangle nuclear point source emission from that of the host galaxy , particularly in cases of poor seeing . is the fitting biased towards identifying higher or lower nuclear point source contributions , under the conditions of different host galaxy sizes , different magnitudes and spatial resolutions ?    in order to address this question , it is important to understand how reliably galfit can extract morphological information from an image .",
    "this issue has been tested both by comparing galfit with other software and via the analysis of simulated data .",
    "for example , floyd et al ( 2008 ) tested the results produced by galfit in comparison with those of 2 dm ( mclure et al 1999 , floyd et al 2004 ) , which is optimised for the analysis of quasars .",
    "both routines produced very consistent results , though the error treatment of the latter was deemed better for sources dominated by their nuclear emission , and overall galfit s separation of the extended host galaxy emission from genuine unresolved emission from the galaxy nucleus was deemed to be very reliable .",
    "this result is backed up by our prior modelling of several sources in the sample , which used our own least - squares fitting routines , also based on the levenberg - marquardt algorithm . for pks2250 - 41 ( inskip et al 2008 ) and pks1932 - 46 ( inskip et al 2007 ) , the structural parameters derived with galfit are in very close agreement with those determined for our previous work .",
    "a number of different groups ( primarily working with hst data ) have used extensive sets of simulated images to test the performance of galfit ( e.g. sanchez et al 2004 ; jahnke et al 2004 ; simmons & urry 2008 ; kim et al 2008 ; gabor et al 2009 ) . in general , the magnitudes of bright point sources are very accurately recovered , although the morphological parameters of the host galaxies of such high - contrast systems were found to be less accurately constrained . however",
    ", spurious point - source contributions were identified in a small number of bulge - dominated systems ( simmons & urry 2008 ) .",
    "such issues are in part due to psf undersampling and/or mismatches ( e.g. kim et al 2008 ) , and the fact that the acs psf follows roughly an @xmath297 profile ( jahnke et al 2004 ) . in cases where the psf and galaxy data are well sampled , galfit accounts for observational point spread functions very robustly ( peng et",
    "al 2002 ; peng et al 2010 ; galfit website ; kim et al 2008 ) , and the size of the observational psf has no significant impact on the further separation of host galaxy from nuclear point source . in the rest frame of our target objects ,",
    "the physical resolution of our observations ranges from @xmath298kpc per pixel at best down to a minimum of @xmath299kpc per pixel for the highest redshift object in our sample . for our worst - resolution object ( pks0023 - 26 ) , the seeing fwhm is equivalent to a spatial scale of @xmath300kpc , and the host galaxy is clearly well resolved beyong this level . for our sample as a whole ,",
    "undersampling of the host galaxy model components is not an issue , nor is undersampling of our psf images , even for our large - field sofi observations .",

    ".    for our more complex model fits ( case c ) , we consider a range of different srsic indices , and identify the best model resulting from the possible values of @xmath345 , 2 , 4 or 6 . while it would be possible to allow the srsic index @xmath292 to vary freely , in general",
    "there is some level of degeneracy between the nuclear point source contribution and srsic index ( and to a lesser extent the background level and galaxy scale length ) . by holding @xmath292 fixed over an appropriate range of values ,",
    "although we may overlook the numerical best - fit , we can more reliably obtain solid values for the other model parameters and a measure of the goodness of fit in each case .",
    "this also gives us a better understanding of how the source deviates from a more standard model which can be easily contrasted with other sources and previous models of the same galaxy within the literature .",
    "where the galaxy is obviously more complex than a single srsic profile plus a point source , we also add further components ; these are noted separately on a case - by - case basis .",
    "finally , following the work of donzelli et al ( 2007 ) we also attempt to fit each source with a combination of an @xmath289 srsic bulge with an @xmath345 srsic disk component ; unlike donzelli et al , we fix the srsic parameter of the bulge at @xmath289 and also explicitly account for a nuclear point source component as an additional optional parameter of our modelling , as opposed to excluding the innermost point source contaminated regions from the model fits .    the results of our modelling are tabulated in table 4 , where we include the relevant values for the pure @xmath289 models ( with and without a nuclear point source ) and also the best fit models with alternative values of @xmath292 and/or the donzelli - style bulge / disk combination where appropriate .",
    "the modelling results are also presented pictorially in figures 2 - 8 ; machine readable images can be obtained from the main 2jy website .",
    "we display contour plots of only the central 50kpc @xmath288 50kpc part of this modelled region in figures 2 - 42a , together with contours of the best - fit model ( as denoted by the bold reduced-@xmath303 values in table 4 ) overlaid on a greyscale of the model - subtracted residual images in the same region .",
    "the choice of displaying only the central area of our modelled regions was made as it provides a far clearer illustration of the match between observation and model , and any residual features observed . in the following section , we provide more detailed notes on the results obtained for each individual object .      in this section ,",
    "we present notes on each individual object in turn . where comparisons are made with other morphological modelling studies in the literature , these all account for the presence of a nuclear point cource component , except where otherwise noted .",
    "pks0023 - 26 , at a redshift of @xmath346 , is one of the higher redshift objects in our sample .",

    "our model tends towards a much larger galaxy size , due to the extensive diffuse emission surrounding the source , the larger @xmath289 srsic index used , and potentially our inability to resolve the innermost regions of the host galaxy to a sufficiently high degree of accuracy and the fact that the surrounding diffuse emission has _ not _ been resolved out in our ground - based data .",

    "we also observe no bias in the measured point source contributions towards more compact galaxies having brighter or fainter nuclear point source components . while weaknesses in the modelling of the central regions of the galaxies could lead to strong degeneracies between total point source contribution , effective radius and srsic index",

    "although we can not rule out a non - agn contribution to the unresolved emission from the galaxy cores ( i.e. the addition of excess nucleated emission due to young stars ) , the potential presence of such features is very unlikely to have biased our other structural parameters .",

    "et al s ground - based study of low redshift radio galaxies also found that the necessary nuclear point source magnitude was not correlated with the host galaxy magnitude , and was about 5 - 10% on average .",

    "these observations have the advantage of better separating the unresolved agn emission from any compact core emission which would not be resolved in ground - based imaging .",
    "as expected , floyd et al s average detection rate of unresolved cores ( in @xmath497 of their sample objects ) is lower than our own ( point sources contributing @xmath498 of the total flux are observed for 76% of our sample , while 56% of our sample objects are best modelled with a point source contribution @xmath499 ) , illustrating that some of the nuclear point source emission isolated in our structural modelling likely originates from physical process other than solely the agn , most likely nuclear star formation regions . however , despite this inability to resolve the innermost regions of the host galaxies as accurately as other studies , the close match between the vast majority of effective radii derived from our modelling and other studies in the literature ( e.g. govoni et al 2000 ; donzelli et al 2007 ; floyd et al 2008 and other references in section 4.2 ) provides a reassuring confirmation of our modelling results .      in table 6 , we display information on the distribution of galaxy morphologies across the different optical classes .",
    "the majority of sources are well described as bulges in all cases , or as a bulge+disk combination .",
    "as expected for orientation - based unification scheme , there are no statistically significant differences between the host galaxies of blrgs and nlrgs , which have an average effective radius of close to 10kpc . while the wlrgs span a similar range of host galaxy sizes , their average effective radius is marginally larger than that of the more powerful blrg and nlrg sources at @xmath500kpc .",
    "of the forty - one sources in our sample for which morphological modelling could be carried out , twenty - five can be adequately described by either a single @xmath289 srsic profile or the combination of an @xmath289 srsic profile plus a nuclear point source ; i.e. 61% of the sample objects are consistent with being de vaucouleurs elliptical galaxies .",
    "while our best - fit model for the post - merger object pks2313 + 03 is also an @xmath289 srsic profile , it should be noted that there are very large residuals for this fit , and this object would be better described with a more complex morphological description .",
    "however , the degeneracies involved prevent us from narrowing the options down to a genuinely best alternative for this source .",
    "for the best fit models of the surface profiles of the remaining sixteen sources , two ( pks0349 - 27 and pks1559 + 02 ) require a steeper @xmath392 srsic index , two ( pks0518 - 45 and pks1814 - 63 ) a srsic index of @xmath368 , and three ( pks0055 - 01 , pks1547 - 79 and pks1549 - 79 ) are consistent with exponential disks .",
    "the final nine galaxies require a combination of host galaxy components for their best - fit model .",
    "in contrast with the modelling of donzelli et al ( 2007 ) , where they find that 45% of their sample objects require multi - component models , only 22% of our sample objects fall into this latter category , and of these only half are very inconsistent with a single srsic profile .",
    "overall , our results are more in keeping with the findings for agn in the sloan digital sky survey , where agn are almost exclusively hosted either by early - type objects or heavily bulge - dominated spirals ( e.g. kauffmann et al 2003 ) .",
    "powerful radio galaxies hosted by late type / disk galaxies , or galaxies with a _ substantial _ disk component , are clearly a rarity . of the three sources in our sample best described by pure exponential disk models ,",
    "one ( pks1547 - 79 ) is currently undergoing a major merger , and the other ( pks1549 - 79 ) is a highly - disturbed post - merger ulirg . with this in mind , an obvious question to ask is whether such sources are more likely to be disturbed / interacting than the more typical elliptical hosts .",
    "we have therefore categorised the galaxies in terms of their interaction status ; these data are also included in table 6 .",
    "sources which display multiple nuclei ( within 10kpc ) , clear interactions ( not merely spatial proximity ) with other galaxies ( either bright or faint relative to the radio source host ) , or noticeably disturbed isophotes are classed as disturbed / interacting .",
    "this accounts for 19 of the sample galaxies , while the remaining 22 objects in the sample appear isolated / undisturbed on the basis of these observations .",
    "this is a very preliminary assessment , which provides no handle on interaction timescales and in some cases may miss the lowest surface brightness features of a late - stage merger .",
    "a more detailed analysis of interaction signatures is provided by ramos almeida et al in their study of the optical images of these sources ( ra10 , ramos almeida et al in prep ) .",
    "however , our basic treatment here does provide a simple , broad overview of the prevalence of clear - cut signs of such activity in radio galaxy hosts .",
    "considering first the different optical classes of radio galaxies , a higher proportion of wlrg hosts appear to be interacting or disturbed : 62% compared with 40% for the nlrg / blrg .",
    "the tendency is contrary to that found by ramos almeida et al .",
    "( 2010 ) based on optical imaging of the 2jy sample at @xmath501 : 55% for wlrg ( though note that the near - ir and optical morphological classifications agree for the objects common to both samples ) compared with 94% for nlrg / blrg . given the small number statistics , the rate of morphological disturbance for the wlrg is consistent between the optical and infared studies , and the major difference lies in the much lower rate of interaction detected in the infared observations of the nlrg / blrg than in optical observations of the same objects .",
    "the latter is to be expected , since the optical observations are far more sensitive to subtle , low - surface - brightness signs of galaxy interactions than the infrared observations .",
    "moreover , the nlrg / blrg are at higher redshifts on average than the wlrg .",
    "finally , we also look at the breakdown of interaction status across the different morphological types . here",
    ", we see that roughly 40 - 50% of galaxies are either interacting or disturbed in all cases , and that there is no significant variation in the relative numbers of interacting / disturbed galaxies between the different morphological types .",
    "we have presented near infrared imaging observations for 41 radio galaxies of the 2jy sample with @xmath2 .",
    "the sources lie close to the tracks for passively evolving galaxies formed at high redshift on the infrared hubble diagram . through a combination of aperture photometry and 2-d surface profile modelling using galfit ,",
    "several useful galaxy parameters have been quantified for the sample , including the percentage contamination by a nuclear point source , srsic index and effective radius .",
    "overall , our structural parameter modelling results are in very good agreement with those in the literature for other radio galaxies at higher and lower redshifts , though a small fraction of the unresolved nuclear emission detected in our objects may be due to unresolved cuspy nuclear starlight profiles rather than agn emission alone .",
    "roughly two thirds of the sources in our sample are hosted by massive elliptical galaxies , with a further 20% being hosted by galaxies best modelled as bulges with an additional disk - component contributing additional flux to the galaxy .",
    "half are clearly either disturbed or interacting with companion objects . except at the lowest redshifts ( where the minimum intrinsic radio power required for membership in a flux limited sample is lower ) ,",
    "disky - type galaxies rarely host the powerful radio sources of samples such as the 2jy sample , unless other events ( such as a major merger ) increase the likelihood of a radio source having been triggered .",
    "although we see no obvious trends between agn type , recent / ongoing merger activity and a tendency towards galaxies being best modelled by either multi - component or disky models , the physical links between agn activity and the host galaxy properties may indeed be very indirect , and subject to time delays between mergers / interactions and any subsequently triggered agn activity . in the second paper of this series , we investigate the case for such links in greater depth .",
    "there , we extend our investigation of the global properties of this sample , tying the newly - measured structural parameters to the other properties of these systems ( including the radio source properties , the ongoing visible and obscured star formation , and the interaction status of the host galaxies ) .",
    "the derived galaxy luminosities , morphological parameters and measures of star formation activity are used to fully characterise the scatter on the infrared hubble diagram . with the aid of literature data",
    ", we will also assess the dependence of the host galaxy characteristics on redshift and radio power .",
    "finally , the combination of optical ( from ra10 ) and near - ir signatures of recent merger activity will be correlated with the overall galaxy morphologies , star formation histories and radio source properties to highlight the links between radio source triggering / agn activity and the ongoing evolution of the host galaxies , and to develop a more thorough picture of the diversity of radio source triggering mechanisms , and the timelines / chains of events involved .",

    "<S> we present the results of a program of @xmath0 and @xmath1band imaging of a sample of 2jy radio galaxies with redshifts @xmath2 , for which the host galaxy morphologies and structural parameters ( effective radius , srsic index and unresolved nuclear point source contribution ) have been determined using galfit . </S>",
    "<S> two - thirds of our sample are best modelled as being hosted by massive elliptical galaxies with srsic indices of @xmath3 , with the remainder being better suited either by a mixture of morphological components ( usually a bulge plus a small , less luminous , disk component ) or by more disky galaxy models with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our measured galaxy sizes are generally in very good agreement with other imaging programs , both space- and ground - based . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine a slightly higher average nuclear point source contribution than similar hst - based programs . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to our inability to separate the agn emission from compact circum - nuclear stellar emission , but does not bias our modelling of the remainder of the host galaxies and our results remain robust . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that roughly half of the objects in our sample are either undergoing major or minor merger activity or are clearly morphologically disturbed .    </S>",
