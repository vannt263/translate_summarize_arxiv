    "recent progress in the fabrication of a near - field scanning thermal microscope ( nsthm ) enables one to measure the radiative heat transfer between a cooled sample and a hot probe directly in the near - field regime , i.e.for distances in the nanometer range  @xcite . due to thermally excited evanescent waves , in this regime one",
    "expects an energy transfer several orders of magnitude greater than the black body value  @xcite . for estimating the heat current in such a device several theoretical models are available , which describe the probe as a dielectric sphere , and the sample as a semi - infinite dielectric body with a flat surface  @xcite .",
    "these models can now be tested against the data provided by the nsthm .    in the literature",
    ", the near - field radiative heat transfer between a sphere and a structured surface has not been studied so far , although such a geometry is of considerable practical relevance and theoretical interest .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we analyze the near - field radiative heat transfer between a spherical probe and planar samples with surface structures such as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : configuration ] .",
    "in particular , we discuss numerical results obtained for a planar surface structured by an infinite bar and a square pad , respectively .    in this work , we use the general formulation of the near - field radiative heat transfer between a probe described as a spherical metallic nanoparticle within the dipole approximation and a second material as developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on rytov s fluctuational electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "this formulation allows one to take the material s properties of the probe into account in terms of its electric and magnetic dipole moments , and the properties of the sample material , which is assumed to be a semi - infinite body with a given surface structure , through the local density of states  @xcite above that medium .",
    "since the dipole moments of the probe or nanoparticle are known it remains to calculate the local density of states ( ldos ) above the sample material .",
    "this is done within a perturbative approximation employing the ewald - oseen extinction theorem , as described in detail in ref .",
    "it should be mentioned that our work is closely related to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the changes of linewidth and the lineshift for a molecule near a structured surface were calculated , since the electric ldos can in principle be read off from the green s function calculated therein . however , in our work not only the electric but also the magnetic fields are determined , since it is known  @xcite that for metallic nanoparticles these magnetic fields can cause a heat transfer much greater than that due to the electric fields , as a result of the induction of foucault s currents .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the dipole model for the radiative heat transfer between a metallic nanoparticle and an arbitrary second material , and outline the strategy of the following calculations .",
    "in order to determine the electromagnetic ldos , we deduce the appropriate dyadic green s functions in sec .",
    "iii by means of a perturbative expansion due to agarwal  @xcite , which we terminate after the first order . within this approach ,",
    "the ldos itself is calculated and numerically evaluated for different surface profiles in sec .",
    "iv , where we also deduce tentative criteria justifying the restriction to the lowest - order contributions . in sec .",
    "v we then present some numerical results for the near - field heat transfer between a metallic nanosphere and a structured surface , and predict signatures that should be observable with a nsthm operated in either constant - height or constant - distance mode .",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that the near - field radiative heat transfer between a metallic nanoparticle with radius @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 and a dielectric material with temperature @xmath2 can be described within the dipole model for particle - sample distances @xmath3 . in this model the electric polarisability @xmath4 and the magnetic polarisability @xmath5 of the particle are given by  @xcite @xmath6 and @xmath7    \\label{eq : alpha_h}\\ ] ] with the permittivity of the probe @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; as usual , @xmath10 denotes the velocity of light in vacuum . assuming that the two bodies are in local thermal equilibrium , the mean energy rate @xmath11 flowing from the hot to the cold body is given by the relation @xmath12 2 \\omega \\bigl (         \\alpha_{{\\rm p}}''(\\omega , r ) d^{{\\rm e}}(\\omega,\\mathbf{r } ) + \\mu_{{\\rm p}}''(\\omega , r ) d^{{\\rm h}}(\\omega,\\mathbf{r})\\bigr ) .",

    "therefore , the thermal radiative heat transfer between a nanoparticle and an arbitrary second medium can be calculated if the electromagnetic local density of states above that medium is known .",
    "we point out that in the opposite limit @xmath21 the dipole model discussed here is not valid , whereas the so called `` proximity approximation '' should prove to be useful then  @xcite .",

    "thus , the evanescent part of the local density of states above a material surrounded by vacuum can also be calculated by means of the equilibrium expressions  @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 which state that the electric and magnetic local density of states at the point @xmath20 is given by the imaginary part of the trace of the renormalised green s functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the renormalisation procedure is defined as  @xcite @xmath32   \\label{eq : renormalisation}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 denoting the green s function of the vacuum .",
    "since the green s function with the observation and source point located above the medium consists of an incident and a reflected part , with the incident part coinciding with @xmath33 , the renormalised dyadic green s function coincides with the reflected green s function , so that the index `` r '' can be understood as both `` renormalised '' and `` reflected '' .    obviously , the relations in eqs .",

    "[ fig : z - spekto ] that for all distances the ratio of the leading two contributions to the magnetic ldos gives much smaller values than the corresponding ratio for the electric ldos .",

    "i.e.  in a situation with @xmath147 , the underlying structure becomes important for much greater distances than for metallic materials , as can be concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : z - spekto ] .",
    "furthermore , a nsthm gives very different images of the underlying structure when either the constant - height or the constant - distance mode is used . in particular , for distances where @xmath148 the values for @xmath11 should resemble the inverse surface structure in constant - distance mode , whereas for distances where @xmath133 becomes important , the measured signal can be rather complex in that mode . on the other hand , in constant - height mode the signal should approximately resemble the topology of the underlying structure at distances where @xmath133 becomes important .",
    "these are strong predictions that are amenable to immediate verification in current experiments  @xcite , and may help to correctly interprete the various types of signals obtainable with a nsthm  @xcite ."
