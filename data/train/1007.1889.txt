    "a major issue of the static , spherically symmetric einstein field equations in gr is to find out interior solutions which are free of singularity .",
    "it has shown that an uncharged incompressible fluid sphere of mass @xmath0 can not be held in equilibrium below certain radius @xmath1 and even demands a larger value for @xmath2 related to physically reasonable equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "regarding stability of the model stettner @xcite argued that a fluid sphere of uniform density with a net surface charge is more stable than without charge .",
    "therefore , a general mechanism have been adopted by the relativists to overcome this singularity due to gravitational collapsing of a static , spherically symmetric fluid sphere is to include charge to the neutral system .",
    "it is observed that in the presence of charge either gravitational attraction is counter balanced by the electrical repulsion in addition to the pressure gradient @xcite or inhibits the growth of space - time curvature which has a great role to avoid singularities @xcite . according to ivanov @xcite the presence of the charge function serves as a safety valve , which absorbs much of the fine tuning , necessary in the uncharged case .",
    "however , in connection to this we would like to mention here a special kind of mechanism to avert singularity as used by trautman @xcite under einstein - cartan theory where physical entity spin - torsion supposed to act as an agent of repulsive effect .",
    "a large amount of works on charged fluid spheres are available in the literature ( an exhaustive discussion with various classification schemes regarding sources for the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) space - time can be obtained in ref .",
    "however , in connection to singularity we would like to mention here that efinger @xcite , kyle and martin @xcite and wilson @xcite have found relativistic internal solutions for static charged spheres , but none of these solutions is absolutely free from singularities . on the other hand ,",
    "spheres of charged dust have been investigated by bonnor @xcite , bonnor and wickramasuriya @xcite and raychaudhuri @xcite . among all these investigations",
    "it is observed that in efinger s solution the metric has a singularity at the origin ( @xmath3 ) whereas the solutions due to kyle and martin @xcite and wilson @xcite do not have any interior singularities .",
    "however , it is argued by junevicus @xcite that in both the above cases the metrics may have singularities at points other than the origin so that restrictions have to be imposed on the sphere to avoid them . according to him the fluid sphere solutions of kyle and martin @xcite , wilson @xcite , kramer and neugebauer @xcite and krori and barua @xcite are of special interest since , with the imposition of suitable conditions , they are completely free of metric singularities and satisfy physical considerations ( for the discussion and analysis of stability vide refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "we would like to note here , specially , the works of krori and barua ( kb ) @xcite and junevicus @xcite which are the basis of our present investigation . krori and barua ( kb )",
    "@xcite constructed static , spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations based on a particular choice of the metric components @xmath4 and @xmath5 in curvature coordinates . assuming that the source is a charged fluid with isotropic stresses , the three independent einstein equations were reduced to linear algebraic equations for the energy density @xmath6 , pressure @xmath7 and the square of the electric field , @xmath8 . in this approach the independent maxwell equation is used to obtain the charge density from the pre - determined form of @xmath9 .",
    "a special feature of kb @xcite solutions is that they are singularity free .",
    "a thorough analysis of this singularity - free kb @xcite solution has been done by junevicus @xcite .",
    "the main aspect of his investigation is to fix up the constants involved in the kb @xcite metric in terms of the physical constants of mass , charge and radius of the source .",
    "he also investigated the conditions for physical relevance leading to a functional dependence of the ratio of mass - to - radius on the ratio of charge - to - mass and also to upper and lower limits on these ratios .",
    "in his recent work on static charged perfect fluid spheres in general relativity ivanov @xcite has also observed that the solution of kb @xcite which are fixed by the junction conditions is non - singular and the positivity conditions are satisfied .    in connection to the above discussion on kb solution @xcite it is to be mentioned regarding the very recent work on these solution by varela et al . @xcite .",
    "the work deals with self - gravitating , charged and anisotropic fluids to solve the einstein - maxwell equations . in order to discuss analytical solutions",
    "they @xcite extend kb method @xcite to include pressure anisotropy and linear or non - linear equations of state .",
    "the obtained solutions satisfy the energy conditions of general relativity and have the following features : ( 1 ) spheres with vanishing net charge contain fluid elements with unbounded proper charge density located at the fluid - vacuum interface ; ( 2 ) inward - directed fluid forces caused by pressure anisotropy may allow equilibrium configurations with larger net charges and electric field intensities than those found in studies of charged isotropic fluids ; ( 3 ) links of these results with charged strange quark stars as well as models of dark matter including massive charged particles are possible , and ( 4 ) the van der waals equation of state leading to matter densities constrained by cubic polynomial equations is considered .",
    "our present investigation of static , spherically symmetric charged fluid sphere distribution is in continuation of the above work of anisotropic fluid source @xcite .",
    "this means that the radial and tangential pressures are , in general , unequal so that the simplest relation between them may be assumed as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , there are several other forms of anisotropic relationship between pressures can be noted in the literature , e.g. , in connection to electromagnetic mass model herrera and varela @xcite introduced a condition of anisotropy in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant having non - zero value whereas barreto et al . @xcite",
    "define the degree of local anisotropy induced by charge as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the local electric field intensity , to consider self - similar and charged radiating fluid spheres as anisotropic sources .",
    "recently , scientists show great interest on chaplygin gas eos in order to explain accelerating phase of the present universe as well as to unify the dark energy and dark matter . as",
    "chaplygin gas eos is a specific form of polytropic eos so it looks promising to describe dark energy spherically symmetric charged objects , generally termed as _ dark stars _ in the literature @xcite . as a possible mechanism of formation",
    "it is argued by several investigators that the first stars to form in the universe , at redshifts @xmath15 , may be powered by dark matter annihilation for a significant period of time rather than nuclear fusion @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is believed that dark energy exerts a repulsive force on its surrounding and this repulsive force , likewise electric charge , may prevent the star from gravitational collapse .",
    "therefore , people have speculated that a massive star does not simply collapse to form a black hole , instead to the formation of dark energy star with a final configuration without neither singularities nor horizons @xcite .",
    "however , among the above mentioned dark star models we are specially interested to the work of bertolami and pramos @xcite where they , like us , have used the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) eos in special reference with anisotropic pressure though our motivation and approach to solve the spherically symmetric gas model is quite different from them .",
    "the scheme of the present investigation is therefore as follows : we write down the four independent einstein - maxwell equations . by allowing the radial ( @xmath16 ) and",
    "tangential ( @xmath17 ) pressures to be different , we have found out the six variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 where the other parameters are , respectively , matter - energy density , electric field intensity and metric potentials ( sec .",
    "ivanov @xcite has explained the usual difficulties that generally arise when we combine equations of state ( even a linear one ) with the field equations .",
    "interestingly , we are here dealing with a non - linear eos and are able to find solutions using an algebraic method ( we do not solve differential equations ) . adding the non - linear chaplygin gas eos @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two arbitrary constants ) and using the kb ansatz for @xmath20 and @xmath21 we get four algebraic equations for @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 . using the independent maxwell equation",
    "we determine the charge density @xmath25 from @xmath26 ( sec .",
    "we present and discuss the necessary matching of the solutions and the related boundary conditions in the sec .",
    "iv which allow us to find out the expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 with their physical features through the graphical plots .",
    "also , energy conditions have been discussed in detailed ( sec .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in sec .",
    "the kb @xcite metric is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 with arbitrary constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the most general energy momentum tensor compatible with spherically symmetry is @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",

    "now , we consider kb ansatz : @xmath41 where , as mentioned earlier , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are some arbitrary constants .",
    "it is of interest to note that these constants were determined by junevicus @xcite in terms of the physical quantities mass , charge and radius of the source .",
    "along with the above ansatz let us also use generalized chaplygin gas eos for the charged fluid as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two positive constants .    equations ( [ eq : lam ] ) and ( [ eq : nu ] ) implies @xmath43    from equations ( [ eq : rad ] ) , ( [ eq : kba ] ) and ( [ eq : eos ] ) , we get the following solution set :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46,\\label{eq : p_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath47    @xmath48 \\label{eq : q^2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 .",
    "we observe that for finite values of the physical parameters @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 .",
    "the rn metric @xcite is given by    @xmath52    to match our interior metric with the above exterior one we impose only the continuity of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 across a surface , @xmath56 , at @xmath57 .",

    "this result was expected as a consequence of the matching conditions at @xmath65 ( absence of thin shell ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the electric field at @xmath67 is zero .",
    "therefore , the energy conditions at @xmath67 involve only the central value of density , as well as for the radial and tangential pressures .",
    "as thin shell exists , so we could not use boundary condition for @xmath26 at @xmath2 which means one can not get @xmath68 .",
    "let us now impose the boundary conditions @xmath69 we obtain two independent equations which are readily solved for @xmath23 and @xmath24 as functions of the source parameters .",

    "the generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equation as presented by ponce de len @xcite is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the effective gravitational mass inside a sphere of radius @xmath81 and @xmath82 is given by ( 15 ) .",
    "the effective gravitational mass is given by the expression @xmath83 derived from the tolman - whittaker formula and the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "it is important to note that the above equation describes the equilibrium condition for charged fluid elements subject to gravitational , hydrostatic and electric forces , plus another force due to anisotropy factor which is a measure of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid comprising the charged body .",
    "combined with ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) , the above equation takes the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88    the profiles of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for sources are shown in fig .",
    "this figure indicates that @xmath90 is comparatively small .",
    "thus the hydrostatic force has a negligible effect in spite of the static equilibrium is attainable due to pressure anisotropy , gravitational and electric forces .        though several specific equation of states for @xmath93 are used in literature , but a very little is known for the much less intuitive second equation of state @xmath94 .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath95 for the anisotropic object can be obtained directly from equations ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , which is given by    @xmath96}{8\\pi \\left(\\frac{f + \\sqrt{f^2 + 2hk}}{h}\\right)}\\ ] ]        fig .",
    "5 shows that the variation of @xmath97 against @xmath81 .",
    "the equation of state for anisotropic charged fluid is positive and confined within @xmath98 i.e. charged fluid is non exotic in nature .",
    "it is well known for the charged fluid that the null energy condition(nec ) , weak energy condition ( wec ) and strong energy condition ( sec ) will be satisfied if and only if the following inequalities hold simultaneously at every point within the source :    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    direct plotting of the left sides of ( 9)-(12 ) show that these inequalities are satisfied as well at every @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) .        at this point",
    "we feel it is required to determine whether specific choices of mass , charge and radius lead to solutions satisfying the above energy conditions at @xmath67 .",
    "a close observation of the equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) suggest us to adopt here some adimensional quantities which can be defined as @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "( equations ( [ eq : a ] ) - ( [ eq : c ] ) in our present case ) are alternatively expressed in the adimensional forms @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "it is very important that the field equations can eventually be expressed in terms of these adimensional constants , the adimensional variables @xmath114 , and the adimensional radial coordinate @xmath115 .",
    "we have seen that particular values of the adimensional parameters @xmath116 determine the adimensional kb constants @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath32 which in turn determine @xmath20 and @xmath21 at every @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "the values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 are restricted by the condition that no horizon is included in the external region described by the rn metric .",
    "we consider all possible roots of the equation @xmath122 .",
    "the radius of the charged sphere @xmath2 is big enough so that no horizons are included in the external rn metric .",
    "the three possible cases are :      @xmath123 .",
    "+ we choose @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 and @xmath120 satisfies @xmath126 .",
    "+ we choose @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 , otherwise arbitrary .",
    "+ the selected values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 determine values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 which should satisfy the energy conditions .",
    "another acceptability condition is that @xmath130 for every @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the arising expressions for @xmath18 and @xmath16 and @xmath132 can be evaluated at @xmath67 .",
    "hence we find the energy density and pressures at @xmath67 as @xmath133 @xmath134    now , the energy conditions @xcite at the centre can be written as : + ( i ) nec : @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 + ( ii ) wec : @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 & @xmath138 @xmath136 @xmath139 + ( iii ) sec : @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 & @xmath140 @xmath136 @xmath141 + ( iv ) dec : @xmath142 @xmath136 @xmath143 + the characterization of dark energy fluid is the violation of one of the sec , more specifically , that one related the raychaudhuri equation @xcite .",
    "if the second of the wec is violated , we have a phantom dark energy fluid .",
    "now , eos at @xmath67 is @xmath144 where , @xmath145    notice that @xmath18 and @xmath16 are decreasing functions of @xmath81 ( these can be shown by plotting the graphs of @xmath18 and @xmath16 or one can find @xmath146 and @xmath147 i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath148 are decreasing functions of @xmath81 ) . since , at @xmath149 , they assume fixed values , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "so , @xmath18 and @xmath148 has a maximum at @xmath67 .",
    "we have checked that @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "bertolami and pramos @xcite argue that if one assumes that the gcg tends to a smooth distribution over space then most density perturbations tend to be flattened within a time scale related to their initial size and the characteristic speed of sound .",

    "the figs 7 and 8 show that these parameters satisfy the inequalities @xmath158 and @xmath159 everywhere within the charged fluid .",
    "now , we use herrera s approach @xcite to identify potentially unstable or stable anisotropic matter configuration known as the concept of cracking ( or overturning ) . since , @xmath160 and @xmath159 , therefore , according to @xcite , @xmath161 . the fig",
    ". 9 of the model also supports this .",
    "now,@xmath162 implies    @xmath163 @xmath164    one can note that the region for which @xmath165 is potentially stable region and the region for which @xmath166 is potentially unstable region .",
    "if @xmath167 keeps the same sign everywhere within a matter distribution , no cracking will occur . the curve profile ( fig .",
    "10 ) for @xmath168 indicates that there is a change of sign and thus alternating potentially unstable to stable region within the distribution .",
    "from , the above analysis indicates that our model is very much unstable within radius @xmath169 unit .",
    "but , the the configuration is stable within @xmath170 . in a recent paper",
    ", andrasson @xcite has discovered a surprising result as :    @xmath171    for a lower bound on the radius r of a charged sphere with mass @xmath108 and charge @xmath109 .",
    "the inequality is shown to hold for any solution which satisfies @xmath172 .    the plot ( fig .",
    "11 ) for @xmath173 against @xmath81 indicates that in the region @xmath170 , @xmath173 is negative .",
    "since , our model is stable within @xmath174 , so andrasson s relation holds good for our model .",
    "it would be interesting to made some comments regarding opposite situations with the maximum mass - radius relation . by using the static spherically symmetric gravitational field equations buchdahl @xcite has obtained an absolute constraint of the maximally allowable mass - radius for isotropic fluid spheres of the form @xmath175 ( for a generalized expression we refer the work of mak et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to calculate effective gravitational mass which due to the contribution of the energy density @xmath18 of the matter and the electric energy density @xmath176 and can be expressed as    @xmath177 r^2 dr = \\frac{1}{2}r + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a } } \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{3}{2 } , ar^2\\right)- \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{a } } \\gamma \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } , ar^2\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath178 is the lower incomplete gamma function . in fig . 12 , we plot the mass - radius relation .",
    "we also plot @xmath179 against @xmath180 ( see fig",
    ". 13 ) which shows that the ratio @xmath179 is decreasing even if the radius is increasing with the mass .",
    "according to ponce de len @xcite the energy conditions require @xmath181 .",
    "these relations lead to a maximum charge is as follows :    @xmath182    where @xmath108 and @xmath183 represent the total mass and charge of the charged sphere of radius @xmath180 .    assuming @xmath184 km and @xmath185 , we find from equation ( 15 ) as @xmath186 .",
    "thus our model satisfies the ponce de len s condition @xcite .    in this connection",
    "we add that the mass - radius - charge relation for compact astrophysical objects plays an important role in many physical processes .",
    "the strong gravitational field due to the density of the matter inside the stars indicates that a strong electric field due to the electric charge is possible to exist .",
    "the effect of electric charge in compact stars assuming that the charge distribution is proportional to the mass density were studied recently by several authors @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are checking the energy conditions only at the center of the charged sphere",
    ". it would be convenient to extend the analysis to other points within the sphere .",
    "a series method like the one used in equations ( 32 ) and ( 34 ) by kb @xcite might be useful .",
    "unlike the work of bertolami and pramos @xcite where they have used the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) eos in special reference to anisotropic pressure we generate the solutions for kb metric under einstein - maxwell space - time .",
    "so a natural question - does the result go over into the solution of bertolami et al . for isotropic stresses ?",
    "the straight forward answer is no .",
    "this is because we have extended kb approach assuming singularity free form of the metric ansatz to charged anisotropic source with non linear , chaplygin type equation of state .",
    "therefore , whether our solution corresponds to chaplygin dark star needs a special verification , specifically whether charged chaplygin dark star does exist demands further investigation . in a similar fashion one",
    "may raise the question that does the result go over into an exact solution for an eos @xmath187 ) ?",
    "the answer this time is affirmative , as our solution coincides with the solution obtained by varela et al .",
    "@xcite for an eos @xmath188 ) .",
    "one can see easily that our results go over into the expressions obtained by varela et al . with @xmath189 .",
    "also , it may be interesting to extrapolate the present investigation to the astrophysical bodies , specially quark or strange stars with radius around @xmath190 km .",
    "we can note that the metric coefficients continuous at the junction i.e. at @xmath56 where @xmath65 .",
    "however , this does not mean that the metric coefficients be differentiable at the junction .",
    "the affine connection may be discontinuous there .",
