    "after the new analysis of the @xmath1 reaction on polarized target in 1997 , the long standing two - fold `` up - down '' ambiguity in scalar - isoscalar @xmath0 amplitudes below 1000 mev reappeared as a four - fold one @xcite .",
    "two of these solutions , called `` steep '' , violate unitarity and can be rejected as non - physical @xcite .",
    "the phase shifts for the two left `` flat '' data sets are presented in fig .  1",
    ".        the biggest differences are in the effective two - pion mass range @xmath2 between 800 and 970 mev i.e. near the two scalar resonances @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the knowledge of the phase shifts in that region is important for example in the determination of the parameters of these scalar resonances and it is crucial for works on dispersion relations for the @xmath0 amplitudes below 1000 mev @xcite .",
    "to determine whether unitary amplitudes , fitted to the `` flat '' solutions , can be treated as physical ones we have checked if they fulfill crossing symmetry conditions @xcite .",
    "we have used , as input amplitudes in roys equations , the scalar - isoscalar ( s0 ) , scalar - isotensor ( s2 ) and vector - isovector ( p1 ) waves defined in @xcite . we have performed simultaneous fits to experimental data and to roys equations in the @xmath2 range from the @xmath0 threshold to 970 mev using the @xmath5 test for @xmath6 with @xmath7 }         { \\delta \\varphi_{\\ell}^i \\left(s_i\\right ) } \\right\\rbrace^2 ,          \\label{eq : chi : exp}\\ ] ] @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the experimental phase shifts and their errors , respectively .",
    "the real parts @xmath11/(2\\,k_i\\,s^{1/2}_i)$ ] are expressed as functions of the @xmath0 phase shifts @xmath12 and have been calculated under the assumption that the inelasticity @xmath13 is equal to 1 in the studied @xmath2 range .",
    "the other real parts , denoted by re  @xmath14 are the output values calculated from roy s equations .",
    "we took @xmath15 value of @xmath16 to obtain reasonable fits to roy s equations .",
    "the @xmath17 experimental values of the `` up - flat '' or `` down - flat '' data between 600 and 950  mev were used in addition to the six data points taken from @xcite .",
    "the s0-wave amplitudes have been constructed by fitting the three coupled - channel model predictions for phase shifts and inelasticities ( see @xcite ) to the data of @xcite . in the s2-wave",
    "we have used the data from solution a of hoogland _ et .",

    "the following pad representation of the s0 phase shifts has been taken : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pion momentum and @xmath20 are constant parameters . above 970  mev and up to 2  gev our coupled channel model @xcite amplitude a , fitted to the `` down - flat '' data , and the amplitude c , constrained by the `` up - flat '' data , were used .",
    "these two representations , one below 970 mev and the second above were joined smoothly at 970 mev up to their first derivative . in the fits",
    "we have also used the near - threshold phase shifts calculated from the differences @xmath21 obtained in the high statistics @xmath22 decay experiment @xcite .",
    "the parameterization of the s2-wave , using a rank - two separable potential model , has been described in @xcite where detailed analysis of the present study is presented . for the @xmath23-wave , from the @xmath0 threshold up to 970  mev",
    ", we have used an extended schenk parameterization @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath23-wave scattering length and @xmath26 is equal to the @xmath27-mass squared . above 970",
    "mev we took the @xmath28-matrix parameterization of hyams et al . @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 were chosen to join smoothly around 970  mev the phase shifts given by both parameterizations .",
    "the contributions to roy s equations from high energies ( @xmath31 gev ) and from higher partial waves ( @xmath32 ) , called driving terms , are composed of contributions from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 resonances and from the regge amplitudes for the pomeron , @xmath27- and @xmath35-exchanges . for the @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "we have used the breit - wigner parameterization with masses , widths and @xmath0 branching ratios taken from @xcite . for the regge parts we have used formulae of @xcite without the @xmath36-crossed terms . in the driving term the @xmath33 resonance dominates in the scalar - isoscalar wave and the isotensor and isovector waves",

    "@xmath37  re  @xmath38  -  re  @xmath39  @xmath37 are of the order of @xmath40 in all three partial waves .",
    "the @xmath5 for 18 points between 600 and 970  mev was 16.6 in the `` down - flat '' and 46.4 in the `` up - flat '' cases .",

    "2b that the solid line lies distinctly below the `` up - flat '' data points between 800 and 970  mev . in contrary , the corresponding line for the `` down - flat '' case in fig .",
    "2a is very close to experimental data in the same range of @xmath2 . in order to improve the fit to the `` up - flat '' data we have used constraints given by the good fit to the `` down - flat '' data .",
    "two parameters were fixed by choosing the values of the scattering length and the slope parameter and two others by the values of phase shifts calculated from this fit at 500 and 550  mev .",
    "a new fit with these constrains gave smaller value of @xmath41 for 18 `` up - flat '' data points , but simultaneously provided us with an enormous value of @xmath42 .",
    "the phase shifts for this amplitude are presented in fig .",

    "the curves labeled _ upper `` in '' _ and _ lower `` in '' _ form a band included inside a band delimited by the lines _ upper `` out '' _ and _ lower `` out''_. all the curves lying inside these bands correspond to the amplitudes fulfilling crossing symmetry so the `` down - flat '' data can be accepted as physical ones . in the `` up - flat '' case in fig .",
    "3 the output band lies outside of the input band from 840 to 970  mev .",
    "it means that in this case crossing symmetry is violated by the amplitudes fitted to the `` up - flat '' data .",
    "having chosen the `` down - flat '' solution as the physical one we have performed another fit with different but uniform parameterizations in s0- , s2- and p1-waves separately ( we have called this fit _ uniform fit _ ) .",

    "the _ uniform fit _ has been done in wider @xmath2 range , than that described in section 2 ( hereafter called _ nonuniform fit _ ) . in the s0-wave case",

    "we present values of @xmath5 functions defined in equations ( [ eq : chi : exp ] ) and ( [ eq : chi : roy ] ) for both fits .",

    "the use of roys equations allows final elimination of the long - standing up - down ambiguity in the @xmath0 phase shifts in favour of the `` down - flat '' solution .",
