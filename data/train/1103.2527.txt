    "the @xmath1co  emission is much fainter in the west of the remnant than in the east .",

    "there is a northsouth oriented branch stretching from the northeastern bright portion and well following the radio continuum  ridge \" that is usually thought to be a structure of the remnant . at this lsr velocity , however , no molecular features other than the `` branch ''",
    "correspond to the other structures of the snr ( e.g. , especially , the eastern radio shell ) .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ s : ridge ] , the faint radio ridge is likely to be irrelevant to the snr .",

    "the lsr velocity of the oh maser , 86@xmath39 , corresponds to similar distances 5.2  kpc and 8.3  kpc .    a modified hi absorption method ( tian et al .",
    "2007 ) is next used to discriminate between the near and far distances .",

    "estimates of the hydrogen number densities , @xmath137 , derived from the volume emission measures ( @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the filling factor of the hot gas and @xmath140 is assumed ) are also given in table  [ t : xpara ] .",
    "in the derivation of the densities we have assumed that the three - dimensional shapes of the elliptical regions ( a and b ) are ablate spheroids .",
    "deviations from these assumptions and the non - uniformity of the x - ray - emitting plasma are consolidated into factor @xmath139 of the individual regions .",
    "as revealed above ( section [ s : vlsr ] ) , snr  kes  78  evolves in an interstellar environment of molecular gas with systemic velocity @xmath50 and expands into a cloudy region in the east .",
    "interestingly , the x - ray - emitting gas in the northeastern edge is characterized by a single thermal temperature ( around 1.5  kev ) and a low number density ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this indicates that the blast wave in the northeast of the snr propagates in the intercloud / interclump medium ( icm ) .",
    "the velocity of the blast wave propagating in the icm can be estimated as @xmath142^{1/2}\\sim1.1_{-0.2}^{+0.1}{\\times 10^{3}}{\\,{\\rm km}}{\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}}$ ] , where the fitted hot gas temperature for region a ( for which the error bars of the spectrally fitted parameters are smaller than those for region b ) , @xmath143 , is adopted as the postshock gas temperature and the mean atomic weight @xmath144 equals 0.61 for fully ionized plasma .",
    "we take the curvature radius of the eastern radio shell @xmath145 as the snr radius , namely , @xmath146  pc , assuming that the dynamical age of the remnant , @xmath147  kyr , is derived with the sedov ( 1959 ) evolution law .",
    "the explosion energy is @xmath148 , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 is the preshock intercloud hydrogen density .",
    "the ionization age of the x - ray emitting gas in the northeastern edge is inferred from the ionization timescales ( see table  [ t : xpara ] ) ; for region a , @xmath151  kyr old , which is slightly , but reasonably , smaller than the dynamical age .",
    "both estimates suggest a relatively young age of kes  78 .",
    "the absence of [ oiii ] leads to an inference that the velocity of the shock wave responsible for the optical filamentary and diffuse structures is @xmath152 ( boumis et al .",
    "this shock can not be the snr blast wave , otherwise the snr should have been in the radiative phase with a considerably large age ( chevalier 1974 ) : @xmath153  kyr , inconsistent with the x - ray properties obtained above . as boumis et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest , however , it is in the interstellar clouds that the slow shocks are propagating .",
    "the bright radio emission in the east of the snr is in agreement with the aggregation of the @xmath50 molecular gas there and the inference that the clouds are clumpy .",
    "the radio continuum emission may arise from the blast shock that propagates in the icm ( blandford & cowie 1982 ) .",
    "contrarily , in the west , the @xmath50 co emission is weak and the radio continuum fades out .    as also mentioned in section [ s : vlsr ] , in the west , the snr expands into a relatively low - density region ; but there the snr seems to collide with a clumpy molecular arc .",
    "the entire snr appears to be in a cavity surrounded by molecular matter .",
    "the molecular number density of  clump 1 \" along the arc is @xmath154/@xmath155 , with an angular radius @xmath23 adopted .",
    "the broad co line wings and enhanced @xmath2co  @xmath3=21/@xmath3=10ratios along the western arc impliy a disturbance suffered by the molecular gas .",
    "similar molecular arcs are seen in some other interacting snrs , such as kes  69 ( zhou et al .",
    "2009 ) and kes  75 ( su et al .",
    "2009 ) , in which the arcs are suggested to represent the debris of the clumpy shells of the progenitors wind bubbles . if the molecular cavity in kes  78  was created by the progenitor , using the linear relation between the main - sequence wind bubble size and the progenitor s mass ( y. chen , et al ..  2011 , in preparationygchen / papers / rb - m / rb - m.pdf ] ) , @xmath156  pc , the cavity radius 17pc would imply a mass around @xmath6 for the progenitor star of snr kes  78 , which seems to be of o9 type .",
    "we have arrived at such a scenario in section [ s : evolution ] that snr kes  78  evolves in a cloudy interstellar medium , the blast wave in the icm giving rise to the x - rays and the cloud shocks in the dense clouds to the optical emission .",
    "the thermal pressure of the x - ray - emitting gas is @xmath157 and @xmath158 for regions a and b , respectively . according to the density - sensitive line ratio of [ sii]@xmath159 , b09 determined the electron densities in the shocked clouds to lie below @xmath160 and suggest a temperature of the electrons @xmath161  k. the upper limit of the thermal pressure in the optically emitting structures is estimated to be @xmath162 , which is similar to the pressure derived for the x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "thus , it seems that the shocked icm may be in pressure balance with the shocked clouds .",
    "however , there is significant pressure variation in the multi - phase cloudy gases in the east of the remnant .",
    "the 1720  mhz oh masers are believed to arise from very dense ( @xmath163 ) regions of mcs that are shocked by the c - type shock waves ( lockett et al .",
    "1999 ) . by means of zeeman splitting",
    ", the los component of the magnetic field in the kes  78 oh maser region , @xmath164 , was measured to be @xmath165 ( koralesky et al .",
    "1998 ) . for a randomly oriented field , the post shock field strength @xmath166 ( frail & mitchell 1998 ; crutcher 1999 )",
    "thus , the magnetic pressure in the oh maser region of kes  78is @xmath167 , which is over two orders of magnitudes higher than the thermal pressures of the x - ray emitting intercloud plasma and the optically emitting filamentary and diffuse structures .",
    "notably , similar pressure variation from the x - ray emitting gas to the oh maser regions is seen in snr  w28 ( rho & borkowski 2002 ) . such a pressure contrast has been suggested to be caused by the interaction of the radiative shell with the dense molecular clumps ( chevalier 1999 ) .      the radio  ridge \" was sometimes suspected to be the western part of an elongated snr shell ( e.g. , caswell et al .",
    "we have seen in section [ s : other ] that the radio ridge appears to be coincident with the northsouth oriented @xmath42 ir branch , which extends from the bright emission in the northeastern region outside the remnant s radio boundary , the @xmath42 emission in and around the eastern region of the snr has a strikingly similar distribution to the @xmath83 @xmath1co  emission .",
    "this leads us to suspect that the radio ridge is not a part of the snr that is associated with the @xmath50 mcs , but rather is associated with the @xmath168 mcs , which is essentially located at the tangent point of the inner scutum ",
    "centaurus spiral arm of the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "optical observation towards kes  78  finds no significant [ sii ] from the radio ridge , while in the eastern , northern , and southern regions of kes  78 , the [ sii ] emission is evident , with the [ sii]/h@xmath16  ratio @xmath169 ( boumis et al .",
    "2009 ) . as the [ sii ]",
    "strength in the shock - ionized gas is comparable to the h@xmath16  strength and is much fainter in the photoionized gas ( hii regions or planetary nebula ; dennefeld & kunth 1981 ) , the radio emission is probably of thermal origin and possibly arises from star formation region(s ) .",
    "furthur study estimating the radio spectral index for the radio  ridge \" will test its nature .",
    "since the progenitor of kes  78  was probably a massive star ( see section [ s : evolution ] ) , a neutron star or pulsar may have been left after its explosion .",
    "psr1850 - 0006 is projected in the northwestern portion of the snr ( keith et al .",
    "however , with a rotational period of 2.2  s and a period derivative of @xmath170  s@xmath101 , the pulsar has a characteristic age of about 8  myr , which is much older than the age of snr kes  78(section [ s : evolution ] ) , disfavoring an association between psr1850 - 0006 and the snr .",
    "the ultracompact hii region located at ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 , j2000 ) is northeast of the snr , as seen in figure  [ f : environ ] .",
    "it is coincident with the massive star formation region iras  18488 + 0000 ( bronfman et al .",
    "1996 ) and may be associated with snr kes  78 .",
    "in fact , a 22  ghz @xmath173 maser at @xmath174 , which is very similar to the systemic lsr velocity of the mcs with which the snr is in contact , is suggested to be associated with the star formation region and is at the same distance ( 5  kpc ) as we determine here for the snr ( beuther et al .",
    "the hii region or iras  18488 + 0000 is located at the northern molecular strip with which the snr interacts and only @xmath23 north of the radio brightness peak of the snr .",
    "another ultracompact hii region at ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 , j2000 ) ( garay et al .",
    "1993 ) appears to be projectionally located on the northwestern boundary of the snr and connects the western molecular arc in the northwest , as seen in figure  [ f : environ ] . in this hii region ,",
    "six 22  ghz @xmath173 masers were detected at the lsr velocity range @xmath177@xmath78 ( hofner & churchwell 1996 ) .",
    "there may not be associated with the snr because they are at different lsr velocities .",
    "as concluded in section [ s : other ] , the bubble / ring - like structure discovered at @xmath179@xmath84 is at a furthur distance ( 5.5/7.9  kpc ) than that to snr kes  78  ( 4.8  kpc ) . if it is an interstellar bubble , then the mean molecular number density of the undisturbed gas before the bubble was created is @xmath180 for the near / far distance .",
    "adopting an expansion velocity @xmath181 ( fwhm of the @xmath1co  line at @xmath182 ) , the kinematic energy is @xmath183 .",
    "if the bubble is blown by a wind , it has an age @xmath184 and the mechanical luminosity of the wind is @xmath185 according to the canonical evolutionary law of a wind bubble given by weaver et al .",
    "this ring / bubble - like structure may not be a distinct snr .",
    "actually , for an snr in the radiative stage ( chevalier 1974 ) , its age is @xmath186 , but the supernova explosion energy would be @xmath187 , which is much higher than the fiducial value @xmath188 .",
    "we have investigated the molecular environment of the galactic snr  kes  78  using the co observations in pmod , kosma , and fcrao and have performed an _ xmm_-_newton _",
    "x - ray spectroscopic study for the northeastern edge of the remnant .",
    "the main results and conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "snr  kes  78  is found to be associated with the mcs at a systemic lsr velocity of @xmath0 . at around this velocity ,",
    "the snr is revealed by the @xmath1coobservation to be in the side of some dense mcs and is consistent in extent with a cavity of @xmath2co  gas .",
    "the snr expands into a cloudy dense region in the east , where the oh maser emission arises and the bright radio shell overlaps with most of the region of strong @xmath2co  emission .",
    "broadened @xmath2co  line profiles discerned in the eastern maser region and the western clumpy molecular arc , the elevated @xmath2co  @xmath3=21/@xmath3=10  ratios along the snr boundary may be signatures of shock perturbation in the molecular gas .",
    "the association of snr kes  78  with the @xmath50 mc , together with the hi absorption along the los , places the snr at a kinematic distance of 4.8  kpc .",
    "the x - rays arising from the northeastern radio shell are emitted by underionized hot ( @xmath4 ) , low - density ( @xmath5 ) plasma with solar abundance , and the plasma may be of intercloud origin .",
    "especially , the x - rays from the radio brightness peak , where a long molecular strip appears to connect , suffers a heavier absorption than those from other parts along this",
    "_ xmm_-observed section of the shell .",
    "the thermal pressures of the x - ray - emitting gas and the optically emitting structures along the shell are lower than the magnetic pressure in the oh maser region by up to two orders of magnitudes .",
    "the age of the remnant is inferred to be about 6  kyr .",
    "the size of the molecular cavity in kes  78 , which is assumed to be created by the main - sequence wind , implies the progenitor s mass to be around @xmath6 .",
    "5 .   the north - south oriented radio continuum ridge west of the bright shell",
    "is suggested to be irrelevant with the snr , but related to a @xmath168 co branch at the tangent point , which corresponds to ir bright , low-[sii]/h@xmath16  ratio star formation region(s ) .",
    "6 .   along the los toward snr  kes  78 , we discern an irrelevant bubble / ring - like @xmath1co  structure @xmath189 in angular radius at the lsr velocity @xmath88 , but the possibility of it being a separated snr is ruled out .",
