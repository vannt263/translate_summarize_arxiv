    "recently , @xcite introduced a simple population genetics model of an infinite population with a continuous distributions of alleles incorporating pleiotropy ( one gene affecting several characters of an organism ) .",
    "they demonstrated that when the number of characters affected is greater than two , the long - time steady state solution of their model can have a nonzero fraction of the population with identical alleles , and that this phenomenon does not occur if the number of characters affected per gene is two or fewer .",
    "in this paper we consider their model and a simple variant of it , addressing several issues .",
    "the first three issues involve the mathematical analysis of the theory .",
    "first we study the time evolution of the distribution of alleles . in the model ,",
    "the initial distribution of alleles is continuous , and at infinite time there is an infinitely narrow ( @xmath0-function ) peak ; , is defined to be a function very sharply peaked around @xmath1 , but having a total weight @xmath2 equal to one .",
    "one definition of such a function is the limit as @xmath3 goes to positive infinity of @xmath4 $ ]",
    ". we shall deal with variables @xmath5 with @xmath6 components . for such variables ,",
    "@xmath7 is defined to be a delta function in the first component of @xmath5 , times one in the second component , @xmath8 . in this way",
    ", one has @xmath9.@xcite ] we ask how the distribution of alleles depends on time at long but finite times .",
    "second , we describe how to construct time - dependent solutions by using an expansion in a sum of functions ( gaussians ) particularly picked to meet the requirements of this problem .",
    "third , we examine the relationship between the model with discrete generations used by waxman and peck ( where mutations occur at discrete times , and fitness selection occurs continuously ) and a continuous - time model in which both mutations and fitness selection occur continuously .",
    "the latter is a limiting case of the discrete model arising when the time between generations gets very short .",
    "we demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the two models is the same , but that dependence of the behavior on the parameters can be different in the two models .",
    "we show that the population genetics models can be mapped onto problems in quantum mechanics , specifically bose - einstein condensation@xcite and motion of a particle in a central potential .",
    "the mapping onto bose condensation is performed on the discrete - time model in the limit that the fitness selection is very strong so that only organisms with fitnesses very near optimum survive each generation .",
    "the mapping onto the quantum particle in a central potential applies more generally .",
    "the simplest case has the potential independent of time .",
    "this case corresponds to the a limit of the population model in which fitness selection and mutations both occur continuously .",
    "the close relation between the continuous - time population biology models and schrdinger s equation has been exploited by brger to obtain many general results on the long - time behavior of models of the type studied here . in this paper , we focus on the mapping for a specific model , which yields a simple physical interpretation of the emergence of a unique genotype , and allows the extraction of the time - dependence of the fitness peak as well as comparison to the discrete - time model .",
    "we find that the behavior is qualitatively identical when the mutations are continuous and when they are discrete , though there are some quantitative differences .",
    "we also discuss our attempts to relate the results from this model to the statistical properties of the sequences that are archived in various sequence databases .",
    "we analyze the statistical properties of gene sequences tabulated in genetic databases and attempt to correlate observed variations with estimates of the degree of pleiotropy of different genes in the databases .",
    "the results of these attempts are inconclusive .",

    "we introduce the theoretical models .",

    "[ continuous ] we present our analysis of the continuous - time model .",
    "section [ crossover ] contains remarks on the relationship between the continuous- and discrete - time models .",
    "section [ database ] presents our examination of dna sequence archives and our attempts to correlate the statistics of documented sequence variations to the degree of pleiotropy of various genes .",
    "section [ conclusion ] recaps our main conclusions .",
    "the appendix contains mathematical details of the analysis of the time - dependence of the continuous - time model aimed at establishing the long - time time - dependence .",
    "one model we study is that of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the population is infinite , the phenotypic variation is continuous , each gene affects @xmath6 characters , and the effects of different genes are uncorrelated ( no linkage disequilibrium or epistasis ) .",
    "the model assumes a very large population of haploid and asexual organisms with discrete generations .",
    "let @xmath5 be a continuous vector with @xmath6 components which represents characters which determine the viability of an organism , and @xmath10 be the normalized probability density that an organism in the population has the characters given by @xmath5 at time @xmath11 .",
    "the normalization condition for the probability is given by an @xmath6-dimensional integral as @xmath12 at each generation an organism with characters @xmath5 survives viability selection with a probability proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "this gaussian fitness selection will play an essential role in our solution of the model .",

    "( [ wpequation ] ) involves the processes of multiplication and of convolution with a gaussian .",
    "if one multiplies two gaussians , one gets another gaussian according to the rule : @xmath37 convolution has slightly different rules .",
    "a textbook integration yields the simple result : @xmath38    instead of doing integrals at each time step , we can write recursion relations for the evolution of the widths and amplitudes of the gaussians .",
    "we then solve these equations in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "our method of solution has similarities with that used by @xcite on a simpler model .    to perform the calculation explicitly , first consider a warm - up problem  the case of no mutations ( @xmath40 ) , which is described by the equation : @xmath41 \\phi(\\xvec , t ) ~ , \\label{nomutateeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is defined in eq .",

    "when @xmath185 , then , since the second term on the right hand side is nonzero as @xmath102 , we must have @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is a constant .",
    "this implies @xmath188 . by calculating the correction to the sum because of this variation in @xmath181",

    "we plot @xmath191 , the fraction of the population which is unmutated , versus time @xmath11 for the parameter values @xmath192 and @xmath193 , for @xmath142 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",

    "a more elegant method is to note that we are looking for a function @xmath261 which satisfies @xmath262 . since @xmath263 is a current @xmath264 that is angle - independent and obeys @xmath265 , then @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath268 .",
    "therefore , one must have @xmath269 , so that @xmath270 . ]    for almost all potentials both @xmath258 and @xmath259 are nonzero ; fourier transforming the term proportional to @xmath259 yields : @xmath271 ( here , @xmath272 is the integral over angles . )",
    "thus , just as in our discrete - time solution , we find associated with a @xmath0-function at @xmath199 a power - law divergence at small @xmath160 , @xmath273 .    in the regime where the ground state is bound , there is a finite energy gap between the ground state and the excited states , which implies that the the long - time limit is approached exponentially in time . when there is no bound state , the energy spectrum of the schrdinger equation is continuous , which leads to power - law convergence to the long - time limit .",
    "these points are discussed in greater detail in the appendix .",
    "in this section we discuss the similarities and differences between the results of our discrete - time analysis valid when @xmath62 and those of the continuous - time analysis .",
    "the basis of our discussion is eq .",
    "( [ generalequation ] ) , which can be used to describe both cases .",
    "qualitatively , the discrete and continuous models exhibit very similar behavior .",
    "they both lead to only smooth distributions ( a  normal \" phase ) for @xmath274 , and for @xmath105 display a transition as the mutation rate is decreased between the normal phase and a  condensed \" phase , where a finite fraction of the population has a unique genotype . in both models ,",
    "the convergence to the long - time limit is power law in the condensed phase and is exponential in the normal phase .",
    "however , there are quantitative differences between the two models , particularly the detailed dependence on model parameters .    in the continuous - time model , the form of eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger2 ] ) makes it clear that the behavior depends only on the single parameter @xmath275 .",
    "in contrast , the discrete model that we solve in the limit @xmath276 ( eqs .",
    "( [ a_0equation]-[a_iequation ] ) ) depends on two parameters : @xmath91 and @xmath14 . for @xmath105 , the discrete model might or might not have a condensate , depending on the value of the ratio @xmath277 . in this regime ,",
    "the continuous - time model is always in the condensed phase .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ generalequation ] ) to discuss the relation between the continuous- and discrete - time models .",
    "one can fourier transform this equation ( as we did in section [ continuous ] for the continuous - time model ) and interpret the result as a quantum - mechanical problem of a particle in a potential which is applied only at the discrete times @xmath278 as in eq .",
    "( [ generalequation ] ) .. ]    the discrete model has two parameters while the continuous model has only one , since eq .",
    "( [ generalequation ] ) depends not just on the mean mutation rate @xmath279 but also on @xmath28 , the time between mutation events .",
    "thus , in principle the discrete - time model has one more parameter than the continuous - time one . if @xmath28 is increased by a factor of two , then the product @xmath280 ( @xmath14 the mutation probability per generation and @xmath281 the viability selection parameter ) remains constant , but @xmath281 itself is halved . the analysis in section  [ discrete ] , which is valid when @xmath282 is very small , and hence in the limit when @xmath28 is very long , yields a solution in which that both @xmath14 and @xmath282 enter explicitly and not just as a product .",
    "nonetheless , two models have very similar outcomes .",
    "here we present our investigations of the statistical properties of dna sequences archived in genetic databases .",
    "the aim is to see if observed sequence variability of a gene is correlated with its degree of pleiotropy .",
    "the focus in this section is on a qualitative prediction of the model , that genes with a high degree of pleiotropy should have a narrower distribution of alleles than those that affect only one trait .",
    "this trend , which is consistent with the mathematical results of the previous sections , is easy to understand : if a gene of high fitness is pleiotropic , then because each mutation affects several characters independently , the chances are high that a given mutation leads to a large fitness decrease .",
    "our first test for possible correlation between degree of pleiotropy and the probability distribution describing genetic variation is simply to count the number of naturally occurring variants of various genes in the _ drosophila _ database flybase@xcite .",
    "we choose to include naturally occurring alleles , including spontaneous mutations arising in laboratory stocks , of the genes analyzed .",
    "mutagen - induced variants are not included , since there is no evidence that they exist in natural populations .",
    "table 1 shows data for nine genes : @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 , @xmath290 , and @xmath291 .",
    "the number of naturally occurring variants is tabulated together with the length of the primary transcript and the approximate length of the genomic region encompassing the gene and its flanking regulatory regions .",
    "transcript and genomic lengths are taken from the full - format gene reports in flybase . for genes with multiple transcripts , we report the length of the longest described transcript .",
    "when the full gene report does not include the genomic length , this is estimated from the flybase molecular map of the gene .",
    "the number of variants per gene is normalized both by the transcript length and by the genomic length . in both cases ,",
    "the values range over approximately three orders of magnitude .",
    "we estimate the degree of pleiotropy of each of the listed genes according to the number of tissues / structures and developmental stages in which the genes are expressed .",
    "this ordering is admittedly arbitrary to some extent , but few would argue with the conclusion that @xmath287 ( encoding a transcription factor essential for development of the midgut ) and @xmath286 ( encoding a homeotic gene establishing segmentation ) are more pleiotropic than the eye color mutants @xmath284 , @xmath291 , and @xmath283 .",
    "inspection of table 1 reveals a clear inverse correlation between estimated pleiotropy and number of variants / transcribed length or variants / genomic length .",
    "this relationship is consistent with the prediction of waxman and peck s model .",
    "a weak point of this approach is that other factors besides degree of pleiotropy could lead to the observed differences in the number of variants .",
    "for instance , even two genes which only affect single traits could have vastly different variabilities , if the traits have greatly different effects on overall fitness .",
    "for example , a gene that controls eye color may well have a much smaller overall effect on fitness than a gene that controls a crucial developmental function . in the population genetics model , differences of this type",
    "are reflected by different values of the fitness parameter @xmath73 . within the model , differences in overall variability caused by changing @xmath73 can be distinguished from those caused by changing the degree of pleiotropy @xmath6 because they yield very different functional forms for the distribution function @xmath247 .",
    "however , counting mutations yields no information about the functional form of the distribution function and thus can not be used to distinguish between the mechanisms .",
    "our second strategy for relating degree of pleiotropy to statistics of archived dna sequences aims to obtain information about the form of the probability distribution for various genes .",
    "it assumes that two genetic variants whose sequences are highly similar in sequence space code for genes that are close together in fitness space .",
    "we use the blast  2 sequence similarity search tool@xcite to search the genbank and embl dna sequence databases against the 8 gene sequences listed in table 2 .",
    "these databases contain sequences of genes from many organisms , though a preponderance of the sequences are from humans .",
    "given a target sequence , blast  2 generates a list of matching sequences along with scores which measure the degree of similarity .",
    "because the maximum possible score for a given sequence is larger for longer sequences , we avoided examining genes that were either very short or very long .",
    "as can be seen in table 2 , the lengths of the sequences examined varied by less than a factor of ten .",
    "only genes were used whose list of matches was truncated because the score fell below the cutoff value of 40 ; no genes were used whose match list was truncated because the number of matching sequence exceeded blast  2 s maximum number of matches of 500 . as shown in table 2 , the number of matches obtained also varies by roughly an order of magnitude for the genes in the table , and is not obviously correlated with the length of the gene .",
    "high blast  2 scores correspond to sequences which match the search sequence the most closely .",
    "the scores range from roughly @xmath292 ( a sequence matching itself ) to the default cutoff of 40 .",
    "we assume that this score is inversely correlated with the evolutionary distance between the input gene and the retrieved sequences , so that a gene with a high fraction of matches with low scores has a broader probability distribution @xmath293 than a gene with more matches with high scores .",
    "thus , if all the matches tend to be very good , the gene is considered to be less variable than one with many poor matches .",
    "we examine the statistics of the closeness of the matches , in particular the fractions of the total number of matches that fall into given ranges of scores .",
    "figure [ blastfigure ] is a plot of a histogram of the fraction of the matches in a given score range obtained versus the inverse of the score for several genes .",
    "we do observe significant variability between these genes ; for example , _",
    "cytochrome  p-1 - 450 _ , which codes for a general - purpose antioxidant expressed in many tissues and is thus plausibly highly pleiotropic , has relatively many very good matches compared to @xmath294 , which is quite specific , coding for a protein essential for vision .",
    "however , we can not claim that there is an unambiguous correlation between degree of pleiotropy and these plots .",
    "for example , _",
    "hox  a1 _ has many poor matches , where it might be expected to be pleiotropic , since it is essential to many developmental functions .",
    "thus , though interesting variations in the statistics of dna sequences for different genes are found , we have not been able to demonstrate convincingly a correlation between degree of pleiotropy and these statistical variations .",
    "the behavior of _ hox  a1 _ can be explained by a process of repeated duplication and divergence over the course of evolution .",
    "many of the retrieved genes have assumed distinct but related developmental functions .",
    "the blast  2 analysis presented here does not account for a shift in score distributions arising from divergence among members of gene families and superfamilies .",
    "another fundamental difficulty with our analysis is illustrated by the case of _ alpha - tubulin _ , which codes for a protein vital to the formation of microtubules .",
    "on the one hand , microtubules are expressed in many different tissues , but on the other hand , all its functions arise from similar structural properties .",
    "thus , one could categorize _ alpha - tubulin _ as either highly pleiotropic ( since it is expressed in many tissues ) or as non - pleiotropic ( since the function is similar everywhere where it is expressed ) . in short , though degree of pleiotropy is defined in the populations genetic model , it is not clear how to quantify it in terms of biological function",
    ".    there are several additional difficulties and ambiguities inherent in comparisons between genome sequence data and population genetics models of the type considered here .",
    "first , the database scores are based on the quality of sequence alignments , whereas the population genetics models define distances in terms of fitness , which is a phenotypic quantity . fitness distance and evolutionary sequence distance",
    "may be quite different ; for example , point mutations at different locations may range in effect from unobservable to lethal .",
    "however , even if there is not a single definite relationship between sequence distance and fitness distance , so long as these quantities are positively correlated with each other , meaningful results may be obtained .",
    "variability in the relation between the distances will result in noisy data , but different genes are all subject to similar uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is plausible to hope that , if significant differences between the sequence variability of two genes are observed , they reflect differences in the fitness distribution @xmath247 of the population genetics models .",
    "another limitation of our analysis is that we consider the fitnesses of alleles as fixed .",
    "this is not necessarily the case , as many gene products function as components of multi - protein structures or pathways@xcite , @xcite .",
    "this dependency of the fitness value of a specific sequence variant on the remainder of the genotype is manifested explicitly by the existence of epistatic interactions ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one may worry that the population genetics model we have used involves a continuously varying phenotype , whereas sequence variations are discrete .",
    "however , because genes are thousands of base pairs long , there is still a huge range of variability , and the use of a continuum model is therefore reasonable .",
    "finally , as mentioned above , pleiotropy itself is defined in terms of phenotypic fitness , and it is not clear how to create an independent measure that enables one to assign objectively the degree of pleiotropy @xmath6 to a given gene .",
    "this is a serious fundamental difficulty that must be overcome if one is to make meaningful quantitative statistical analysis of the possible correlations between the sequence statistics and the degree of pleiotropy .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed some variants of a population biology model incorporating selection , mutation , and pleiotropy .",
    "we have focussed on understanding the circumstances under which at long times a nonzero fraction of the population has a unique genotype , and on characterizing the time dependence of the population distribution in this regime .",
    "we have analyzed both the discrete - time model of @xcite as well as an associated continuous - time model .",
    "we find :    1 .   in both the discrete and continuous - time models ,",
    "a unique genotype can emerge only when @xmath6 , the number of characters affected by each gene , is greater than two , a result in agreement with @xcite . for any @xmath105 , the infinite - time population distribution @xmath250 contains a @xmath158function contribution when the mutation rate is nonzero but small , but not when the mutation rate is large enough .",
    "2 .   in the regime where @xmath250 has a @xmath0-function contribution , this @xmath0-function is accompanied by a @xmath295 singularity at small @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   the @xmath0-function peak emerges as the limit of a peak that continually becomes higher and narrower .",
    "thus , in this regime the convergence to the @xmath102 limit is power - law .",
    "4 .   in the regime when @xmath250 is smooth , the convergence to this distribution is exponential in time .",
    "the continuous- and discrete - time models exhibit qualitatively identical behavior , but there are quantitative differences between them .",
    "our analysis of the discrete - time equations relies on the use of gaussian functions for both the fitness and mutation terms .",
    "however , our analysis of the continuous - time model assumes only that the potential in the quantum mechanics problem is attractive and short - ranged .",
    "therefore , we expect our results to apply qualitatively for a large class of different mutation terms .    other mechanisms giving rise to genetic diversity such as antagonistic pleiotropy , genetic drift , and discreteness of alleles change qualitatively the nature of the equations describing the system .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether the  condensation \" phenomenon investigated here is robust when these effects are taken into account .",
    "in addition to our mathematical analysis , we also attempted to assess whether the degree of pleiotropy of genes resulted in systematic trends in the degree of variation they exhibited in the mutations documented in online genetic databases .",
    "these attempts to correlate the degree of pleiotropy with the statistics of the sequence variations were inconclusive .",
    "available database resources do not allow unbiased sampling of the sequence variation present in a natural population .",
    "such a database is likely to emerge as the human genome project s present initiative to sample the extent of sequence variation in a wide array of genes in the american population progresses .",

    "this result has been shown by brger and collaborators ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; for completeness we derive it here and emphasize the implications for the approach to the long - time behavior in the population biology model .",
