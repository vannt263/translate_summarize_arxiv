    "early - type galaxies are traditionally classified into elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies .",
    "more than thirty years ago , before observations of the stellar kinematics were available , e galaxies were thought to constitute a homogeneous class of simple oblate systems , with an isotropic velocity distribution , and in which the flattening provided a measure of the galaxy angular momentum ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "lenticular galaxies were considered similar to spiral galaxies , containing an isotropic bulge and a disk , but without significant evidence for gas and dust .",
    "the revolution came in the late 70 s , when it became possible to extract the stellar kinematics of bright galaxies . to characterise the degree of ordered rotation in galaxies the anisotropy diagram",
    "was introduced , which relates the ratio between the ordered and random motion ( ) in a galaxy to its observed flattening ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the small observed values of , for a sample of 13 bright e galaxies , was interpreted as evidence that these systems are inconsistent with being oblate systems , close to isotropic and supported by rotation @xcite . as rotation was not needed to flatten the systems , the observations could also be explained by assuming that e galaxies were triaxial and supported by orbital anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the observations were later extended to a sample of 11 fainter e galaxies @xcite and bulges of 9 barred @xcite and 8 unbarred @xcite spiral galaxies . from the resulting compilation of a sample of 50 es and bulges , over two orders of magnitude in luminosity , it was found that , contrary to the brighter systems , the fainter galaxies and the spiral bulges were rotating fast and their location on the  diagram was consistent with oblate isotropic rotators @xcite .",
    "it was later discovered that the fast rotating galaxies also tend to have disky isophotes , while the slow rotating ones have boxy isophotes @xcite .",
    "one possibility to explain this connection between photometry and kinematics was to assume the fast rotating galaxies all contained disks seen at various inclinations on top of a spheroidal stellar component ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations at different scale heights on edge - on disk galaxies however showed that bulges themselves are rotating fast @xcite .",
    "the slow rotation of the brighter es could be equally due to either radial or tangential anisotropy . to address this point @xcite used two - integral jeans dynamical modelling to analyse a compilation of long slit kinematics of 37 bright es . he concluded that es as a class are _ radially _ anisotropic .",
    "this appeared consistent with what had been observed in the outer parts of @xmath7-body simulations of collisionless collapse @xcite .",
    "the difference between the different types of spheroidal systems could be explained in the context of galaxy formation as due to the relative importance of gaseous dissipation @xcite .",
    "the whole picture was summarised by @xcite who proposed a revision of the standard photometric classification @xcite of early - type galaxies into e and s0 .",
    "they suggested that there was a dichotomy between two classes of early - type galaxies : ( i ) on one side the bright , boxy , slow rotating , and radially anisotropic e galaxies , with a break between a steep outer surface brightness profile and a more shallow nuclear cuspy core , and ( ii ) on the other side the generally fainter , disky , fast rotating and isotropic disky - e and s0 , without clear breaks between the outer and nuclear profiles .    more recently a systematic investigation of the anisotropy of a sample of 21 luminous , nearly round and slowly rotating elliptical galaxies was performed using spherical models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they found that ellipticals are only moderately radially anisotropic .",
    "@xcite constructed more general axisymmetric models and explored the anisotropy of a sample of 12 early - type galaxies , which included flattened objects .",
    "they found a range of anisotropy and no obvious trend ( except near the nuclear supermassive black holes ) , but they also found the roundest galaxies to be generally only weakly anisotropic .",
    "however the models in these studies were generally fitted to the kinematics extracted along a few long - slit positions .",
    "the introduction of panoramic integral - field spectrographs on large telescopes , combined with the advances in the dynamical modelling techniques , has opened the possibility for a reanalysis of the orbital distribution in early - type galaxies .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use ` sauron `  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) integral - field stellar kinematics to derive the  anisotropy diagram for the ` sauron `  sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) in a new way that can be rigorously interpreted with the formalism of @xcite .",
    "the results are analysed making use of a new classification scheme that we introduce in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ix ) .",
    "the anisotropy derived from the  diagram is interpreted and tested using general axisymmetric dynamical models for a subsample of the survey galaxies .",
    "the galaxy sample is described in section  2 . in section  3",
    "we describe the dynamical modelling technique and in section  4 we present our modelling results . in section  5",
    "we present the   diagram obtained from the ` sauron `  data , while in section  6 we compare our results with previous works . finally in section  7",
    "we draw some conclusions .",
    "two different subsamples are used in this paper .",
    "( i ) the main galaxy sample ( table  [ tab2 ] ) is composed of the 48 e and s0 galaxies of the ` sauron `  survey ( paper  ii ) . the  diagram of this sample is presented in section  [ sec : vs_lines ] .",
    "( ii ) for half of the survey galaxies we constructed axisymmetric dynamical models to interpret the ` sauron `  diagram .",
    "this modelling subsample of 24 galaxies ( table  [ tab1 ] ) is the same used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  iv ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes : the meaning of the various columns is the same as in table  [ tab2 ] . here",
    "the effective radii  are mostly taken from rc3 .",
    "exceptions are ngc  221 for which  was taken from paper  iv , and ngc  2679 , ngc  6547 and ngc  6548 , for which  was determined from our mdm photometry .    @xmath8 these two galaxies show nearly face - on bars .",
    "the ellipticity represents the one of the outer disk , which also defines the photometric pa .",
    "[ tab3 ]    in addition to the 48 e / s0 galaxies of the ` sauron `  representative sample presented in section  [ sec : vs_lines ] , we observed 18 additional e / s0 galaxies with ` sauron ` , using the same setup as for the main survey . for these galaxies we extracted the stellar kinematics and measured the  and @xmath9 using the same procedures and definitions as for the main sample ( section  [ sec : vsigma ] ) and",

    "[ fig : v_over_sigma_lines ] , where , in addition to the 48 galaxies of the ` sauron `  survey , we also include the 18 specials .",
    "the new galaxies still populate the same regions as the galaxies from the main survey , confirming the result from that smaller sample .",
    "in particular all the fast - rotators still lie within the envelope defined by the @xmath10 relation ( the magenta line ) and its variation with inclination , while the slow - rotators lie in the bottom - left part of the  diagram .",
    "the five new slow - rotators are on average flatter than the ones in the survey sample , but still fall within the same ranges of low ellipticity ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a notable exception is ngc  720 which is at the edge of being classified as a fast - rotator ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) , but is quite flat and lies well below the magenta line .",
    "this galaxy shows little rotation , but displays a clear and symmetric velocity pattern , with no kinematical misalignment and no sign of photometric twist @xcite .",
    "all this indeed supports the classification of this galaxy as a fast - rotator and would suggest that the slow rotation may be due to counterrotating stellar components , as in the case of ngc  4473 and ngc  4550 ( section  [ sec : understand ] ) .",
    "however , contrary to this hypothesis is the lack in ngc  720 of an elongation of the @xmath11 field along the galaxy major axis .",
    "two - integral dynamical models using the jeans equations @xcite already showed that part of the slow rotation in this galaxy must be in the form of a flattened velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane [ @xmath12 i.e.  df not of the form @xmath13 .",
    "this galaxy shows evidence from x - ray observations of being embedded in a triaxial dark - matter halo @xcite and the stellar component may be triaxial as well .",
    "detailed three - integral schwarzschild s dynamical modelling is needed to clarify the nature of the orbital distribution in this interesting galaxy .",
    "but for the 66 e / s0 galaxies observed with ` sauron `  ( 48 galaxies from the main survey plus 18 specials ) .",
    "the red and blue labels refer to the slow and fast rotators respectively .",
    "the filled symbols refer to the galaxies in the ` sauron `  survey , while the ngc numbers indicate the 18 ` special ' objects.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a key additional test provided by this extended sample concerns the shape distribution that we discussed in section  [ sec : shape ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics_pa_66 ] we present a plot of the kinematical misalignment for the new sample of 18 galaxies , in addition to the ` sauron `  sample .",
    "the sample of specials contain four additional slow rotators ngc  4168 , ngc  4261 , ngc  4365 and ngc  4406 , which display a very clear rotation along the apparent minor axis and are certainly not oblate bodies ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion about ngc  4365 , but see @xcite ) .",
    "these new objects confirm that some of the slow - rotators must be triaxial . a previous indication that large kinematics twists tend to appear only in the boxy slowly",
    "rotating galaxies was found by @xcite .",
    "the additional fast - rotators still show no significant kinematical misalignment ( @xmath14 ) , the only exception being ngc  2679 which has a morphology dominated by the obvious oval shape of a nearly face - on bar .",
    "even the face - on barred galaxy ngc  6548 has a kinematical pa which well agrees with the pa of the large scale stellar disk . in total , out of 49 fast - rotators presented in this paper , the only two that show significant kinematical misalignment , and are thus not consistent with axisymmetry , possess strong bars or show signs of recent interaction",
    "this provides strong evidence that _ all _ the fast - rotators constitute a homogeneous family of flattened and nearly oblate systems ( sometimes with embedded bars ) .",
    "but for the whole sample of 66 galaxies with existing ` sauron `  stellar kinematics .",
    "blue and red symbols refer to the fast / slow - rotators respectively .",
    "the filled symbols refer to the galaxies in the ` sauron `  survey , while the ngc numbers indicate the 18 ` special ' objects .",
    "the morphology of ngc  2679 is dominated by a strong face - on bar , which explain the observed large misalignment .",
    "all the other new fast - rotators are consistent with a family of nearly oblate bodies and show no significant kinematical misalignment.,title=\"fig : \" ]      a number of caveats and possible improvements apply to the results we discussed in the previous sections :    the sample of e / s0 galaxies we consider in this paper is still relatively small and is not fully representative of the whole galaxy population .",
    "the modest size of the sample constitutes by far the largest limitation of the present study .",
    "although the available kinematics extends to larger distances and has higher @xmath15 than what was used in previous studies of the  diagram , it is still spatially limited and does not sample the whole galaxy , as would be required for a rigorous interpretation of the  diagram .",
    "the comparison between the modelling results , which treat the limited spatial coverage in detail , and the  results ( section  [ sec : vsigma ] ) , and the test with isotropic models ( appendix  [ sec : test_iso ] ) , all indicate however a general agreement , suggesting the results are reliable .",
    "another effect is that slow - rotators tend to have larger  than the fast - rotators .",
    "for this reason the former are not spatially as well sampled as the latter .",
    "we verified that the conclusions would not change if we restricted our analysis to within @xmath16 for all galaxies .",
    "the ` sauron `  representative sample includes a number of barred galaxies .",
    "since their complex structure and dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not be represented in detail by oblate spheroids , and axisymmetric models likely provide only a very rough approximation , it is therefore unclear how bars affect correlations derived under the oblate assumption .",
    "most strong bars must however have been rejected by the selection criteria for the @xmath17 galaxy in our modelling subsample , so they are unlikely to be the primary driver behind the observed trend between @xmath6 and @xmath18 .",
    "the slow rotating galaxies are likely weakly triaxial @xcite and the assumption of axisymmetry in our models certainly introduces a bias in the recovered anisotropy . as it appears that the triaxiality of these systems is not strong , at least in their central regions , the inferred anisotropy is likely to be representative of what we would measure from a full triaxial model @xcite .",
    "a more detailed investigation of this issue will be presented in a future paper .",
    "in this section we compare the results on the  diagram derived from our ` sauron `  integral - field stellar kinematics to previous results obtained from long - slit kinematics . the  diagram from long - slit data of e galaxies",
    "was first presented and discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was later extended to galaxy bulges by @xcite .",
    "a widely known form of the diagram is the one presented in @xcite , which is based on a compilation of long - slit kinematical measurements for 50 elliptical galaxies and bulges .",
    "the compilation was extended by @xcite and many new observations were added by @xcite .",
    "the largest homogeneous set of long - slit  and ellipticity values is currently constituted by the 94 measurements for elliptical galaxies by r.  bender ( private communication ) .",
    "we will refer to this sample as that of @xcite , although it was later extended with new unpublished measurements .    to perform a comparison between long - slit and integral - field  measurements one has to take into account that the two techniques measure two different quantities and",
    "can not be compared in a rigorous way . from integral - field data",
    "one measures a luminosity - weighted quantity ( equation  [ [ eq : vsigma ] ] ) , which is closely related to the corresponding quantity appearing in the tensor virial equations and can be used directly in a quantitative way . from long - slit kinematics ,",
    "one usually only measures the quantity @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the maximum observed velocity ( usually on the galaxy major axis ) , while @xmath21 is an average value of the velocity dispersion inside @xmath16 .",
    "this value can not be linked to the expression appearing in the tensor virial equations without some rather arbitrary assumptions or ` calibration ' with models .    from theoretical considerations",
    ", @xcite provides a very rough connection between the two  determinations .",
    "he shows that the long slit @xmath19 measurements agree with the isotropic line , in the old formalism , if the isotropic line ( his equation  [ 9 ] ) is scaled by a factor @xmath22 so that for an oblate isotropic galaxy @xmath23 at @xmath24 . in his new integral - field formalism",
    "the isotropic line is a factor @xmath25 lower ( his equation  [ 26 ] ) than that in the old one when @xmath26 , so that for an oblate isotropic galaxy @xmath27 at @xmath24 . for our adopted value @xmath28 ( appendix  [ sec : test_iso ] ) one has @xmath29 at @xmath24 so that the expected combined decrease from long - slit data to integral - field one would be a factor @xmath30 .",
    "however , as also pointed out by @xcite , the precise form of this equation depends on the detailed velocity distribution in a galaxy , as well as on the field coverage of the observations , and should not be expected to be quantitatively accurate .",
    "this was in fact his motivation to introduce a new formalism for integral - field data .    to avoid the approximations and assumptions in the above theoretical derivation , and to be able to compare directly our ` sauron",
    "`  values with those measured with long - slit observations by @xcite , we selected the 28 galaxies in common between the two samples and we determined the best scaling factor by least - squares fitting ( fig .",

    "we found a best - fitting relation @xmath31 which is @xmath32 lower than the above rough theoretical estimation .",

    "however integral - field kinematics provides many advantages over long - slit measurements for the study of the  diagram : ( i ) the dynamical models can only be uniquely constrained by integral - field kinematics ; ( ii )  can be compared to the theoretical value in a rigorous way , without the need for an ad - hoc scaling , allowing for a quantitative comparison with modelling results , in individual cases , as we did in section  [ sec : vsigma ] ; ( iii ) the ability to accurately determine the kinematical misalignment allows us to recognise the different shape distribution of the fast / slow - rotators ; ( iv ) the possibility to rigorously measure the specific angular momentum adds the crucial ability to distinguish between fast and slow - rotators , independently from the  diagram itself ( paper  ix ) . a proper kinematical classification of the galaxies is the key for the interpretation of the  diagram .      the comparison between the ` sauron `  diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : v_over_sigma_lines ] and the corresponding one by @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_bender94 ] shows clear differences in the distribution of the observed galaxies .",
    "the reason for these differences are easily understood as due to very different selection criteria in the two samples .    the early - type galaxies of the ` sauron `  survey were selected to have an absolute blue magnitude @xmath35 , and in this luminosity range to include 24 objects in both the e and s0 morphological classes , to be uniformly sampled in @xmath36 and in the observed ellipticity ( as given by * ? ? ? * hereafter rc3 ) . by construction",
    ", this sample provides a uniform coverage of the  diagram , but does not give a representative sample of early - type galaxies in the given magnitude range .",
    "in fact the true observed shape distribution of e / s0 galaxies displays a clear maximum at an ellipticity @xmath37 and lacks very round and very flat galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the requirement of a uniform sampling in @xmath0 obviously produces an excess of very round and very flat galaxies with respect to the general galaxy population .",
    "an additional complication arises from the fact that the ` sauron `  selection was done according to the rc3 ellipticities , which are measured at large radii .",
    "the ellipticity in galaxies is generally not constant and its variation depends on galaxy luminosity , in the sense that luminous galaxies tend to become rounder in their central parts than in their outer parts @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 used in the  diagram are those measured in the central regions , where the kinematics is available , and not those of rc3 . as a result of this ,",
    "the ` sauron `  selection produces a distribution in @xmath0 which is difficult to quantify .",
    "although the ` sauron `  sample selection , by construction , erases any information given by the @xmath0 distribution , one may naively expect the distribution in for any given @xmath0 interval , to be representative of the general e / s0 population , as no explicit selection was performed in . in practice , this is not the case because of the morphological selection , which implicitly introduces a selection on . in particular table",
    "[ tab2 ] shows that out of the 24 galaxies classified as e from rc3 , 14 ( 58% ) are classified as fast - rotators and 10 ( 42% ) as slow - rotators .",
    "for the s0 galaxies 23 ( 96% ) are fast - rotators and only 1 ( 4% ) is a slow - rotator .",
    "[ fig : v_over_sigma_lines ] shows that the fast - rotators tend to lie above the magenta line , at any given @xmath0 , while the slow - rotators are in the bottom - left part of the  diagram .",
    "this implies that the selection of s0 galaxies will guarantee objects above the magenta line in the  diagram , while e galaxies will provide an equal number of objects above the magenta line and in the bottom - left part of the diagram .",
    "the morphological selection thus defines the allowed ranges of  of any galaxy .",
    "the requirement of an equal number of e and s0 galaxies in every interval of @xmath0 specifies a certain distribution of galaxies in the  diagram , which is not representative of the early - type galaxies population .",
    "these selection biases are very difficult to estimate and to correct for from the present sample , as they depend on the unknown distribution of fast / slow - rotators as a function of intrinsic galaxy shape and morphological classifications .",
    "the morphological selection also affects the appearance of the  diagram as obtained from the long - slit measurements by @xcite .",
    "that sample is in fact constituted only by e galaxies .",
    "as originally pointed out by @xcite , clearly stated by @xcite and strongly confirmed in this paper and paper  ix , the e class constitutes a quite heterogeneous group , made by less than half of genuine non - rotating ellipticals ( the slow - rotators ) and the rest by disk - like systems , resembling s0 galaxies ( the fast - rotators ) .",
    "the appearance of the  diagram of e galaxies thus depends on the fraction of fast - rotators that are ( mis)classified as e in different @xmath0 intervals .",
    "a direct comparison with the ` sauron `  diagram for the e galaxies alone ( open circles ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsigma_morphology ] .",
    "although the ` sauron `  sample has only 25% of the number of e of @xcite , the distribution of the galaxies appears qualitatively similar .",
    "the  values for the e galaxies of @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_bender94 ] span the same region as those of ` sauron `  of fig .  [",
    "fig : v_over_sigma_lines ] or [ fig : v_over_sigma_66 ] .",
    "however there are three main qualitative differences between this diagram and the ` sauron `  one , which can be understood as due to differences in the sample selection : ( i ) the e selection in the long - slit sample poses an upper limit on @xmath38 , as otherwise the galaxies would be classified as s0 .",
    "( ii ) the lack of s0 in the long - slit sample implies a smaller fraction of fast - rotating galaxies ( above the magenta line ) , compared to the ` sauron `  diagram .",
    "( iii ) the fact that there was no explicit selection on @xmath0 in the long - slit sample gives a smaller fraction of very round galaxies , compared to the ` sauron `  sample .",
    "moreover older samples of  values tend to prefer flatter e , as these were thought to be most likely to be seen edge - on , and consequently better consistent with the assumption of the  diagram .",
    "it is important to obtain an unbiased view of the  diagram , from a larger statistical sample , to be able to compare the observed distribution of fast - slow rotators , with the predictions from different galaxy formation scenarios . for this",
    ", one needs a sample which is only selected in absolute magnitude and is not biased by the morphological selection , as the currently available samples . some selection in morphological type is still required , as the  diagram looses its meaning for spiral galaxies , which have a clear bulge and a thin disk component with very different ellipticity .",
    "however , contrary to the problematic classification into e or s0 galaxies , the separation between early - types galaxies and spirals is robust and clearly bimodal @xcite . only with this larger and unbiased sample of e / s0 galaxies",
    "will we be able to understand whether the fast - rotators all really fall within the envelope indicated by the current study , and whether the distribution of the slow / fast - rotators shows a bimodality in the  diagram , as the current data seem to suggest .",
    "in section  [ sec : selection ] we showed that our ` sauron `  data on the  diagram are generally consistent with previous long - slit works .",
    "the current study however seems inconsistent with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in its finding that the massive and slowly rotating galaxies are _ not _ more anisotropic than the generally fainter and fast - rotating galaxies ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_beta ] ) .",
    "part of the difference between the current work and the previous ones may lie in the sample selection , which here includes s0 galaxies , as they can not be distinguished from the other fast - rotators .",
    "the rest can be understood as due to ( i ) the use of the parameter @xmath39 as a measure of galaxy anisotropy and ( ii ) the neglect of inclination effects on the  diagram .",
    "the anisotropy parameter was defined by @xcite as @xmath40 i.e.  the ratio between the observed  value for a galaxy and the predicted value @xmath41 for an oblate galaxy with isotropic velocity dispersion tensor @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "@xmath39 is not a reliable way of measuring anisotropy in a galaxy and should be replaced by the real anisotropy value @xmath42 .",
    "the problems of @xmath39 as a measure of anisotropy @xmath42 are the following : ( i ) galaxies with the same @xmath42 but with different intrinsic ellipticity @xmath43 , can appear to have dramatically different @xmath39 when seen edge - on , and even more different @xmath44 .",
    "in particular the rounder galaxies will have a systematically lower @xmath39 at any given @xmath42 ( fig .",

    "( ii ) a galaxy with a given @xmath42 and @xmath43 , will appear to have a lower @xmath39 at lower inclinations ( @xmath45 being edge - on ) as shown e.g.  in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_over_sigma_lines ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the blue diamonds and red squares represent the location of edge - on galaxies , with different intrinsic ellipticity @xmath43 but the same anisotropy @xmath46 .",

    "bottom panel : _ location of the galaxies of the top panel in the @xmath47 diagram .",
    "the diamonds and squares represent galaxies with the same small anisotropy , so one should expect @xmath48 .",
    "there is however a dramatic decrease of @xmath44 for the objects which fall close to the region of the slow - rotators ( red squares ) , which is not associated to any variation in the anisotropy.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the slow - rotators generally have observed ellipticities @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v_over_sigma_lines ] and [ fig : comparison_bender94 ] ) , which implies they are intrinsically not very flat . the fast rotators can be intrinsically flat .",
    "given this difference in the shape of the fast and slow - rotators , both the ellipticity and inclination effects mentioned in the previous paragraph act to systematically decrease the observed @xmath39 of the slow - rotators with respect to the fast - rotators , giving the misleading impression of a strong increase of the anisotropy .",
    "we conclude that @xmath39 should not be used as a measure of anisotropy .",
    "observations at high redshift , combined with detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background , have provided a scenario for galaxy formation in which the universe is dominated by dark matter of unknown nature .",
    "the general picture for the assembly of the dark matter seems to be rather well understood and is described by a hierarchical process driven by the sole influence of gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "much however still has to be learned about the way the luminous matter , namely the stars and galaxies that we actually observe , form from the accretion of gas within the dark matter potential .",
    "the complication comes from the fact that these processes are driven by the hydrodynamic and chemistry of the gas , combined with complex feedback processes of the radiation on it .",
    "one way to constrain the formation of the luminous matter in galaxies is by trying to uncover the ` fossil record ' of that process in nearby galaxies , which can be observed in great detail due to their vicinity .",
    "a key element to differentiate between different galaxy - formation model is the degree of anisotropy and the amount of rotation in early - type galaxies , in relation to other galaxy properties like luminosity , surface brightness profiles or chemical composition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "observations show that early - type galaxies can be broadly separated into the most massive giant ellipticals on one side , which are red , metal - rich , slowly - rotating , and have shallow central photometric profiles , and the fainter objects on the other side , which tend to be bluer , metal - poor , are dominated by rotation , have cuspy profiles and may contain disks @xcite    a first factor determining these observed differences in the structure of early - type galaxies appears to be the amount of dissipation during the last galaxy merger .",
    "in particular more anisotropic and slowly rotating galaxies result from predominantly collisionless major mergers , while faster rotating galaxies are produced by more gas - rich mergers , where dissipation plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of gas - poor mergers in the hierarchical formation of massive galaxies @xcite would help explain the fact that slowly rotating galaxies are more common in the high - mass galaxy range . a second factor driving the galaxy structure seems to be the mass fraction of the merger components .",
    "equal - mass galaxy mergers tend to produce more slowly rotating galaxies than mergers of significantly different mass ratio @xcite .",
    "a third factor appears to be the feedback on the gas , during a merger event , produced by the radiation emitted by a central agn or by supernovae winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a complete understanding of the formation of early - type galaxies , and the relative role of the different factors , requires the treatment of the above phenomena in a cosmological context , within the hierarchical merging process .",
    "this still has to be attempted in a rigorous way as current computer simulations can not resolve the many orders of magnitude scales that are involved in these processes .",
    "this implies that instead of describing the gas via accurate hydrodynamical and radiative transfer equations , the models use approximate and very simple relations , based on empirical relations , to describe the process .",
    "this paper and the companion paper  ix provide new observational constraints for the upcoming models . in the next section",
    "we speculate on the formation scenarios for the observed characteristics of early - type galaxies that we derived .",
    "the fast rotators seem consistent with galaxies with a significant disk component , which experienced minor mergers and accreted a significant amount of gas @xcite .",
    "the accreted gas , which settles in the galaxy equatorial plane and forms stars , would explain the metallicity enhancement in the plane of the disk ( paper  vi ) and the nearly perfect alignment of the angular momentum of the different , sometimes counterrotating , stellar structures ( section  [ sec : understand ] ) .",
    "the minor mergers may explain the fact that rounder galaxies have a larger @xmath49 dispersion orthogonal to the disk plane ( along the @xmath50-axis ) .",
    "the disk instabilities triggered by minor mergers can in fact deviate stellar orbits out of the disk plane and produce an increase in the @xmath49 dispersion and a corresponding thickening of the disk .",
    "the trend may also be related to the two - components nature of the fast - rotators .",
    "disks may be more anisotropic than bulges and are more prominent in flat galaxies ( section  [ sec : bulges ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations seem able to produce the observed level of anisotropy in these systems @xcite , but it is unclear for what conditions they will reproduce the observed trend between anisotropy and flattening .",
    "although we do not find any physical distinction between e fast - rotators with disky isophotes and s0 fast - rotators with an obvious disk component , and this suggests a common formation scenario for the whole class of objects , the current observations do not necessarily require a common origin .",
    "originally the slow rotators were thought to form at high redshift via equal mass mergers of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the n - body simulations were able to produce some slowly rotating systems that appeared like ellipticals , however it became clear that this simple picture could not explain the observed appearance of slowly rotating ellipticals as a class @xcite .",
    "in addition , current numerical simulations of gas - free major mergers seem to generate large fractions of strongly triaxial or prolate galaxies ( @xmath51 ) than we do _ not _ observe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a missing ingredient in these models is the cosmological context , which produces sequences of mergers .",
    "also lacking is a detailed treatment of the gaseous component , which is likely to play an important role in the early universe .",
    "major gas - rich mergers , regulated by the feedback of a powerful central agn , have been suggested to explain the scaling relations of early - type galaxies @xcite and to reproduce the dichotomy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the colour distribution of galaxies as a function of their luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is unclear why the slow rotators in our sample possess the low degree of anisotropy that we observe in their central regions .",
    "a process that could in principle explain both the relatively small anisotropy and the roundish shape of the slow rotators would be the global transition to chaos , as can be produced by central supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "current estimates of black holes mass fractions @xcite seem however too small to produce significant effects .",
    "the transition to chaos and the symmetrisation of the major triaxial merger remnant could be significantly enhanced by the gas inflow and its nuclear concentration during the initial phase of the mergers , before the gas is expelled from the galaxies by the agn activity @xcite .",
    "another process that could explain the isotropy and shape of the slow - rotators , especially for the most massive galaxies found near the centre of cluster potentials , is a sequence of radial mergers @xcite .",
    "the detailed observations of the structure of the small sample of nearby galaxies that we discuss can be related to much less detailed observations at higher redshift obtained with much larger survey . from the analysis of a large sample of galaxies in the nearby universe , observed by the sloan digital sky survey ,",
    "it was found that galaxies are well distinct in terms of their colour , in the sense that they can be clearly separated in a so called ` blue cloud ' and a ` red sequence ' @xcite .",
    "this discovery , and the subsequent realisation that the bimodality can be traced back in time at higher and higher redshift @xcite , allowed a dramatic improvement in the detailed testing of galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "it is now believed that the gas - free and dead , red - sequence galaxies form by merging of gas - rich , star - forming , blue - cloud galaxies , followed by a rapid ejection of the gas , due to the feedback from a central supermassive black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a merger event between blue gas - rich galaxies",
    "the gas tends to settle onto a plane and form a disk , so that the end result of the merger , after the gas has been expelled from the system , will be a red , purely stellar system dominated by rotation .",
    "but mergers can still happen between red gas - poor galaxies , in which case simulations show that the resulting red galaxy will show little or no rotation .",
    "we speculate that the two classes of fast and slow - rotating galaxies that we described may be the relics of the different formation paths followed by early - type galaxies when loosing their gas content and moving from the ` blue cloud ' to the ` red sequence ' , in the ` quenching ' scenario of @xcite . in that picture",
    "the fast - rotators are naturally associated with the spiral galaxies whose disks were quenched by ram - pressure stripping or other ram - starvation processes , and subsequently experienced mainly minor mergers .",
    "the slow - rotators can be generated by a sequence of mergers involving little amount of gas along the red sequence , or due to major violent gas rich mergers in which the gas component was rapidly expelled by a starburst or a central agn .",
    "we analysed the orbital distribution of elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies using observations of the stellar kinematics within one effective ( half light ) radius obtained with the ` sauron `  integral - field spectrograph .",
    "we constructed the  diagram for the 48 e / s0 of the ` sauron `  sample . for a subsample of 24 of the galaxies , consistent with axisymmetry .",
    "we use three - integral axisymmetric schwarzschild models to recover the detailed orbital distribution .",
    "we used a new classification of early - type galaxies based on the stellar kinematics ( paper  ix ) , to divide the sample into two classes of objects with and without a significant amount of angular momentum per unit stellar mass .",
    "we refer to these two types of object as `` slow - rotators '' and `` fast - rotators '' respectively .",
    "the slow - rotators are more common among the brightest systems , and are generally classified as e from photometry alone .",
    "the fast - rotators are generally fainter and are classified either e or s0 .    from the combined analysis of the dynamical models and the  diagram we find that , in the central regions ( within @xmath52 ) of the galaxies which we sample with our kinematics :    1 .   the slow rotators can display misalignment between the photometric and kinematic axes , indicating that as a class they are triaxial .",
    "those in our sample tend to be fairly round ( @xmath1 ) , and span a range of moderate anisotropies ( binney 1978 anisotropy parameter @xmath2 ) .",
    "2 .   the fast - rotators can appear flattened ( @xmath3 ) , do not show significant kinematical misalignment ( unless barred or interacting ) , which indicates they are all nearly axisymmetric , and span a large range of anisotropies ( @xmath4 ) . _",
    "the main physical difference between fast and slow - rotators is not their degree of anisotropy , but their intrinsic shape .",
    "the measured anisotropy appears to be due to a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane ( @xmath5 ) , which we quantify with the @xmath6 anisotropy parameter . while the velocity dispersion tends to be similar along any direction orthogonal to the symmetry axis ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we find a general trend between the anisotropy in the meridional plane @xmath6 and the galaxy intrinsic ellipticity @xmath54 .",
    "flatter galaxies tend to be more anisotropic . 5 .",
    "the results from the models are consistent with the values of the anisotropy inferred from the  diagram of the whole ` sauron `  sample of 48 e / s0 , which we determined from our integral field kinematics .",
    "we find that the distribution of the fast rotating galaxies is well described as a family of nearly oblate galaxies following a trend between flattening and anisotropy .",
    "this result is confirmed when we include in the sample 18 additional e / s0 galaxies observed with ` sauron ` .",
    "although the sample of early - type galaxies considered in this work constitutes the first significant sample for which the  diagram and the anisotropy could be investigated with integral - field stellar kinematical data , the main limitation of our work is the relatively small number of galaxies and the complicated sample selection effects .",
    "even so , as we discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we are able to reach some provisional conclusion on the formation of early - type galaxies .",
    "we reviewed the usefulness of the  diagram to test galaxy - formation models .",
    "a similar analysis , performed on a much larger sample of galaxies could provide much stronger constraints on the process by which galaxies form .",
    "we thank andi burkert and marijn franx for very useful comments , ralf bender for providing his latest long - slit  measurements and ortwin gerhard for providing his numerical values of the anisotropy .",
