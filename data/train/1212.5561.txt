    "multi - component polymer materials including nanocomposites , fiber - reinforced plastics , and polymer blends typically have inhomogeneous internal structures on a mesoscopic level .",
    "the properties of such mixture materials are strongly dependent on the distribution of their internal structures , namely , the mixture quality @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a common need to develop a quantification measure to describe the mixture quality of multi - component polymer materials .",
    "such a technique would also be required to evaluate mixing processes in various mixing devices in the field of chemical engineering @xcite .",
    "though various methods for the analysis of mixture quality have been proposed , these approaches are sometimes system - specific and fail to directly assess hierarchical internal structures . to compare different mixture systems ( different filler loading , different mixing conditions , etc .",
    ") , a simple quantification method based on non - system - specific criteria is required . in general , internal structures in a complex mixture",
    "have their own characteristic scales .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous quantification of size and distribution is necessary .",
    "however , deviation from uniformity , which is a commonly used method , often misses characteristic scales of internal inhomogeneity because uniform distribution itself is intrinsically defined without any scale . from this observation ,",
    "the identification of characteristic scales is a fundamental problem when discussing the mixture quality of complex mixtures .",
    "many prior works regarding the quantification of mixture quality primarily focused on the non - uniformity of distribution , regardless of the sizes or structures of the dispersed phase . typically for a dispersion of spherical particles ,",
    "the center points of the particles are first identified , then the distribution of the center points is analyzed @xcite .",
    "one direct approach to measure the distribution inhomogeneity is to evaluate the deviation from the uniform distribution based on fluctuation of the point density @xcite .",
    "another approach is to evaluate a certain cost function of the inter - point distance , which is the minimum when the points are uniformly distributed  @xcite .",
    "these techniques are useful for systems where the ideal distribution is homogeneous but not for systems with internal structures .",
    "the length scales of internal structures can not assessed by these approaches . instead of measuring deviation from uniformity , a degree of clustering",
    "was used to characterize the inhomogeneity of the distribution .",
    "the spatial correlation function of density of the dispersed phase is the simplest way to define correlation length , which is an average size of the cluster @xcite .",
    "alternative methods to define size were developed based on either a concentration gradient  @xcite , or the inter - point distance  @xcite .",
    "the size of the matrix phase not containing the dispersed phase can also be used to characterize the clustering tendency , which is closely related to the mechanical reinforcement of nanocomposites  @xcite .",
    "another method is based on the mathematical morphology , which considers the volume fraction of isotropic virtual dilation of the dispersed phase .",
    "the dependence of the volume fraction on dilation differs depending on the degree of clustering  @xcite .",
    "these approaches focus on one representative length scale but not on the multiple characteristic scales associated with hierarchical internal structures .",
    "internal structures within a complex mixture are often hierarchical in nature .",
    "thus , different scales associated with hierarchical structures should be involved in characterizing the mixture quality of a complex mixture .",
    "the only other known study that has assessed inhomogeneity at different scales involves the mix - norm method  @xcite .",
    "however , the mix - norm method has focuses on the defining non - uniformity of a system in which the ideal mixture state is uniform for all scales and thus does not apply to the identification of hierarchical characteristic scales . in this paper",
    ", we propose a scale - dependent measure for inhomogeneity of complex mixtures that is capable of identifying multiple characteristic scales of inhomogeneity .",
    "the degrees of inhomogeneity are defined at different scales through the coarse - graining of the concentration field of a dispersed phase .",
    "multiple characteristic scales are identified with the scale dependence of inhomogeneity .",
    "we demonstrate how the scale - dependent measure works by applying the technique to synthetic dispersions with different distributions .",
    "this technique can aid in comparing different complex mixtures and can provide a fundamental understanding of the mixture quality of systems with different internal structures .",
    "we start with a concentration field , @xmath0 , of a component in a mixture .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the mixture can be characterized based on the fluctuation in the concentration field , which contains information on a microscopic level .",
    "the resolution of @xmath0 is determined by the resolution of the data obtained .",
    "because the definition of inhomogeneity should not depend on the total content of the component , we consider the normalized concentration field , namely a probability density , as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the whole domain of the mixture . the induced probability density @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 irrespective of the total content of the dispersed substance @xmath5 . to quantify the fluctuation of a specific scale ,",
    "the coarse - grained field is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the domain of a linear size @xmath8 around a location @xmath9 .",
    "coarse - graining is a familiar concept in statistical physics and has been especially useful in characterizing fractal structure in fluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "coarse - graining has also been applied to characterize time - series with long - range correlation@xcite . in these applications ,",
    "fractal structures were characterized by power - law scaling , and the exponents of this analysis were a primary concern . here , we are interested in applying the coarse - graining concept to quantification of mixture quality .",
    "the fluctuation at a resolution scale @xmath8 is characterized by the statistical moment , @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 represents the magnitude of fluctuation : a large positive @xmath11 indicates a large fluctuation and a negative @xmath11 indicates a small fluctuation . if a mixture is homogeneous at a scale @xmath8 , @xmath12 holds . for instance , in the limit of macroscopic scale , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the system size , and the coarse - grained concentration becomes @xmath15 by definition ; therefore , the normalized moment is always close to unity at the system size , @xmath16 .",
    "this property simply represents the macroscopic homogeneity in the general situation .",
    "furthermore , if there is no coherent structure of scale @xmath8 , the relationship @xmath17 holds with a coefficient @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the spatial dimension . based on the properties ( [ eq : mu_qp ] ) and ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , to characterize the inhomogeneity of a mixture",
    ", we define the _ inhomogeneity function at scale @xmath8 _ by a normalized moment , @xmath20^{1/(q-1)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to understand the physical implication of @xmath21 , we consider a mixture with a correlation length @xmath22 . in this case",
    ", the inhomogeneity function behaves as @xmath23 the fluctuation in a smaller scale than @xmath8 is accounted for in @xmath24 .",
    "three ranges of characteristic scales are observed . in the large - scale regime of @xmath25",
    ", the mixture appears to be homogeneous .",
    "this leads that eq.([eq : mu_qp ] ) holds , and then @xmath26 is obtained irrespective of @xmath11 . at the small - scale regime of @xmath27 ,",
    "the mixture has a certain level of inhomogeneity . in this scale , eq.([eq : scaling1 ] ) holds and @xmath28 is obtained asymptotically irrespective of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 approaches a certain level depending on non - uniformity at the smallest scale . at the correlation scale of @xmath29 , the rapid variation of",
    "@xmath21 characterizes the correlation scale in the mixture . from the inhomogeneity function",
    ", we can identify both the macroscopic homogeneity and microscopic inhomogeneity of a mixture . to characterize macroscopic homogeneity",
    ", we define the scale of homogeneity , @xmath30 , which is a lower bound , as @xmath31 holds for @xmath32 . in general , @xmath21 is a monotonously decreasing function of the scale @xmath8 , which corresponds to the decreasing inhomogeneity as the observation scale enlarges . to identify a characteristic scale in a mixture clearly , it is convenient to see the first derivative of @xmath21 .",
    "we define the _ scale susceptibility _ of the concentration fluctuation as @xmath33 which takes a finite positive value when @xmath21 decreases sharply based on the characteristic scale of the fluctuation . because we are foucusing on hierarchical structures with a wide range of scales , the scale susceptibility is defined as the derivative with respect to @xmath34 .    for the cases described in eq.([eq : fqr_scale_l ] ) , the scale susceptibility becomes @xmath35 from which the characteristic scale @xmath22 is identified . in practical situations ,",
    "the scale susceptibility @xmath36 is more convenient than @xmath21 to identify the characteristic scale @xmath22 . we demonstrate how @xmath21 and @xmath36 work by applying them to synthetic images with a definite characteristic scale and different levels of concentration fluctuation .",
