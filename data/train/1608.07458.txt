    "<S> the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) is one of the cornerstones of the modern theories of gravity , stating that the trajectory of a freely falling test body is independent of its internal structure and composition . </S>",

    "<S> we make an attempt to constrain possible deviations from wep utilizing the modern accelerator technologies . we analyze the ( absence of ) vacuum cherenkov radiation , photon decay , anomalous synchrotron losses , and the compton spectra to put limits on the isotropic lorentz violation and </S>",

    "<S> the on - shell emission of a photon by an electron or positron in the vacuum , so - called vacuum cherenkov radiation , is normally forbidden kinematically . however , in the presence of the nontrivial modification of the dispersion relation ( [ energy ] ) with @xmath15 , the energy - momentum conservation condition allows such a process . in other words , the electron ( positron ) </S>",

    "<S> the threshold on the photon energy @xmath24 is given by@xcite @xmath25 , where we assumed for simplicity that the electron s dispersion relation is modified in the same way as the positron s , since there are no precise limits on the gravitational mass of the ultrarelativistic electron either . </S>",
