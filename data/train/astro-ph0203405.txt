    "in recent years the study of the vertical structure and kinematics of the h  i disks of spiral galaxies has been pursued almost exclusively with observations of galaxies viewed either edge - on or face - on .",
    "the study of edge - on systems has revealed vertical extensions of the h  i layer up to several kpc from the plane and , in the case of ngc  891 , also a slower rotation velocity of the gas in the halo @xcite . in the face - on or nearly face - on galaxies the observations have shown vertical motions of neutral gas frequently associated with ` holes ' in the h  i distribution @xcite .",
    "these results point at a substantial gas circulation between disk and halo ( review by @xcite ) .",
    "the ejection of gas out of the disk is thought to be related to star formation in the disk and to be due to stellar winds and supernova explosions that blow out ionized gas . after cooling ,",
    "this gas falls down to the plane .",
    "such processes are generally described as _ galactic fountains _",
    "there are cases , however , in which the vertical motions originate from external events such as collisions with intergalactic clouds and with small companions @xcite .",
    "accretion of intergalactic ` primordial ' gas , as proposed for the high velocity clouds in our galaxy @xcite , may also play a role .",
    "the present study represents a first attempt to use objects at intermediate inclination angles which offer the advantage that , for a given object , information is obtained on both the density structure and the kinematics of h  i in the vertical direction .",
    "the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  2403 is a suitable candidate because of its inclination angle of @xmath2  60@xmath3 , and also because of its extended h  i layer ( about twice the optical size ) , its regular kinematics and its symmetric , flat rotation curve .",
    "ngc  2403 is an isolated sciii galaxy ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) with a bright optical disk of about 8 kpc diameter surrounded by outer , faint - surface - brightness ` fossil arms ' @xcite .",
    "it hosts rich h  ii regions with brightnesses comparable to that of the 30  doradus complex @xcite .",
    "previous h  i observations with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) @xcite of ngc  2403 showed systematic asymmetries in the h  i velocity profiles along the major axis in the form of wings on the side of the lower rotation velocities , towards systemic .",
    "this pattern ( we refer to it as ` the beard ' ) is similar to that found in galaxies viewed edge - on or observed with low angular resolution but it is totally unexpected in ngc  2403 if its h  i disk is thin .",
    "schaap et al .",
    "( 2000 ) re - analyzed sicking s ( 1997 ) observations of ngc  2403 and investigated the effect of the layer thickness in order to explain such a pattern .",
    "they concluded that the beard may be produced by h  i gas located above the plane ( in a thick disk or halo ) and rotating more slowly than the disk .",
    "their picture is very similar to that proposed by swaters et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for ngc 891 .",
    "we obtained new h  i observations of ngc  2403 with the very large array .",
    "these have led to a considerable improvement of the observational picture and to the detection of new , very faint emission from h  i with remarkably anomalous kinematics .",
    "we have observed ngc  2403 with the cs configuration of the vla on four separate days in january and february , 1999 .",
    "this configuration differs from the regular c - array in that the middle ( fifth ) telescope on the north arm is located at the innermost north arm location of the d array .",
    "this leads to a spatial resolution similar to that of the regular c - array , while adding short baselines  and hence sensitivity at larger angular scales  not - found in regular c - array observations @xcite .",
    "each observation was 12 hours in duration , of which approximately 10 hours were spent on source .",
    "the remaining time was used to observe one phase calibrator ( 0841 + 708 ) and three flux calibrators ( 3c48 , 3c147 , and 3c28 ) .",
    "the latter were used for bandpass calibration as well .",
    "the observational parameters are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "calibration and editing of the data were done separately for each of the four data - sets , using standard procedures of the aips ( astronomical image processing system ) package .",
    "nineteen channels at both ends of the band ( excluding the very edges ) were identified as being free of line emission .",
    "the aips task uvlin @xcite was then used to interpolate this continuum emission across the range of channels containing line emission , and subtract it from the @xmath4 data .",
    "the resulting continuum - free @xmath4 dataset containing the combined data for all four days was then further reduced using the miriad ( multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display ) package .",
    "the data cube was made using robust or briggs weighting @xcite with robustness 0.2 getting a spatial resolution of @xmath2  15@xmath5 or 230 pc at the adopted distance of 3.18 mpc @xcite .",
    "another data cube was made by applying a gaussian taper in the visibility domain .",
    "this data cube has a spatial resolution of @xmath2  30@xmath5 .",
    "the two cubes have 62 channels ranging in velocity from @xmath124.7 km  s@xmath0 to 289.6 km  s@xmath0 and spaced by 5.15 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "to these data a hanning smoothing was applied in velocity , leading to a velocity resolution of 10.3 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the dirty images were deconvolved using a clark clean algorithm @xcite . to identify the region of emission ,",
    "the cubes were firstly cleaned with a cutoff of 3 times the r.m.s .",
    "the resulting images were then used to interactively define the regions of line emission in each channel .",
    "next , a deep clean ( cutoff of @xmath2  0.2 @xmath6 ) was performed .",
    "after cleaning , a few channel maps still showed some spurious effects ( figure  [ fig2 ] , top left corner of maps from 217.5 km  s@xmath0 to 248.4 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "these may indicate the presence of very extended h  i associated with the outer parts of the warp .",
    "some channel maps show serious contamination from h  i emission from our galaxy at velocities around 0 km  s@xmath0 ( figure  [ fig2 ] , see the channel maps between @xmath2  @xmath110 km  s@xmath0 and @xmath2  @xmath710 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "this contamination is slightly reduced by applying the hanning smoothing and also by using high resolution data because it generally has a greater angular scale than the emission from ngc  2403 .",
    "comparison of our global h  i profile with a previous single dish profile from @xcite ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) shows we are not missing significant h  i flux due to missing short spacings . the final data cube at @xmath2  15@xmath5 resolution has a r.m.s .",
    "noise per channel of 0.17 mjy beam@xmath0 , while the lower resolution data cube has a r.m.s .",
    "noise of 0.22 mjy beam@xmath0 .",
    "the minimum detectable column density ( 5 @xmath6 detection in one velocity resolution element in the 30@xmath5 resolution cube ) is @xmath8 @xmath9 ( 0.15 @xmath10 pc@xmath11 ) corresponding to @xmath2  2.6 @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath10 beam@xmath0 .",
    "this very high sensitivity has permitted us to detect very faint components in the neutral hydrogen that were not seen in previous observations .",
    "a summary of the parameters for the two cubes is given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "once the data cubes were obtained , the subsequent analysis was done using the gipsy ( groningen image processing system ) package .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows every second channel map of the 30@xmath5 resolution cube of ngc  2403 .",
    "we present here the smoothed data because they show more clearly the faint h  i components .",
    "some representative channels at high ( 15@xmath5 ) resolution are shown in figure  [ fig8 ] overlaid on an optical dss image .",
    "we also present several position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams parallel to the major ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) and minor ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) axes .",
    "the cuts are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] overlaid on the total h  i map .",
    "the full resolution total h  i map ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) was obtained by adding the channel maps containing h  i emission ( from @xmath119.6 km  s@xmath0 to 279.3 km  s@xmath0 ) . for each channel",
    "map the areas with h  i emission were outlined using masks made on the 30@xmath5 resolution smoothed data cube .",
    "the total h  i mass , corrected for the primary beam attenuation , is 3.24 @xmath14 0.05 @xmath12 10@xmath15 @xmath10 .",
    "the value of the mass derived for this galaxy by @xcite was 3.0 @xmath12 10@xmath15 @xmath10 while @xcite with more sensitive observations derived 3.13 @xmath12 10@xmath15 @xmath10 assuming the distance of 3.18 mpc .",
    "for comparison the single dish mass @xcite is 3.31 @xmath12 10@xmath15 @xmath10 .",
    "to first order , the distribution and the kinematics of the h  i are regular . figure  [ fig6 ] ( left panel ) shows the total h  i at low ( 60@xmath5 ) resolution overlaid on the dss optical image .",
    "the radius of the h  i disk down to a column density of @xmath2  0.2 @xmath10pc@xmath11 ( 2.5 @xmath12 10@xmath16 @xmath9 ) is about 22 kpc ( the holmberg radius is 13 kpc ) .",
    "the h  i disk appears to be full of holes , some having kpc sizes @xcite .",
    "the very outer layer is warped .",
    "the warp is highly asymmetric , more pronounced on the eastern side of the galaxy ( see channels from 176.2 km  s@xmath0 to 227.8 km  s@xmath0 ) than on the western side where it is just faintly visible ( channels from 42.3 km  s@xmath0 to 62.9 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the warp is also visible in the total h  i map and in the velocity field at low resolution shown in figure  [ fig6 ] where the h  i disk on the n - e side appears to be more extended .",
    "a summary of the optical and h  i parameters for ngc  2403 is given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the most striking characteristics of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen in ngc  2403 are illustrated in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "this diagram offers a display of the h  i emission along the major axis of ngc  2403 .",
    "it was obtained by integrating the 15@xmath5 full resolution data over a slice 1@xmath17 wide in order to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "clearly , the h  i line profiles are strongly asymmetric with respect to the peak of the line emission . note that the white squares , which mark the rotation curve , follow closely the ridge of the h  i. there are h  i tails extending ( as a beard ) towards the systemic velocity .",
    "the brighter of these tails had been seen in previous 21-cm observations with the wsrt and already reported by schaap et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . because of the higher sensitivity of the present observations the tails are now much easier to recognize and they appear to extend over a much larger region of the position - velocity map . a clearer picture of the extent , the structure and the kinematics of the gas in the beard is now emerging .",
    "the density distribution is characterized by sub - structures in the form of filaments and spurs .",
    "these are observed all over the h  i disk at velocities that differ tens of km  s@xmath0 from rotation .",
    "the most remarkable filament has a size of @xmath2  8 kpc and is visible in the channel maps between 93.8 km  s@xmath0 and 155.6 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "it has a coherent structure and kinematics and its total h  i mass is @xmath2  1 @xmath12 10@xmath18 @xmath10 .",
    "it does not show any obvious relation with any feature in the optical disk ( see upper right and bottom left panels of figure  [ fig8 ] ) or with the h  i spiral arms .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 p - v plots parallel to the major axis ( and partly also that along the major axis itself ) in figure  [ fig4 ] show this filament elongated on the low velocity side between 0@xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath17 .",
    "remarkably , it follows the overall pattern of the low - density gas suggesting that it is just a prominent condensation of gas within it and not a separate feature .",
    "the p - v plots parallel to the minor axis ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) show an asymmetric distribution of the low - level emission ( tracing the beard ) . in the diagrams from @xmath14@xmath17 to @xmath11@xmath17 , at velocities below the systemic velocity ( horizontal line at 133 km  s@xmath0 ) , this low - level emission appears preferentially in the left part of the diagrams , between 0@xmath17 and @xmath2  @xmath710@xmath17 ( north - east side of the galaxy ) , whereas at velocities above systemic it is more visible in the right part of the plots . in the diagrams from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , at velocities above systemic the low - level emission is more prominent on the right part of the diagrams ; at velocities below systemic it is in the left part . a similar asymmetric distribution of the low - level h  i emission is also seen in the channel maps close to the systemic velocity ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) where the lower contours do not follow the h  i ridge and seem displaced counter - clockwise .",
    "this effect indicates a rotation of the kinematical axes of the faint emission with respect to the axes of the cold disk . as we will discuss later ( see section 3.2.1 ) such a change in the kinematical position angles can be attributed to an overall radial motion of the anomalous gas of about 10@xmath120 km  s@xmath0 towards the centre of the galaxy .",
    "apart from the extended low - level emission described above , the p - v diagrams in figure  [ fig4 ] and figure  [ fig7 ] also show emission in the forbidden quadrants .",
    "this is particularly clear in the upper right quadrant in figure  [ fig7 ] ( 0@xmath17 to @xmath23 north - west with respect to the centre ) along the major axis at projected velocities ( around 200 km  s@xmath0 ) which differ from rotation by more than 130 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the spatial location of this gas can be seen in the channel maps between 165.9 km  s@xmath0 and 217.5 km  s@xmath0 where it is visible just north - west of the centre .",
    "the total mass of this gas is 4.3 @xmath12 10@xmath24 @xmath10 .",
    "the channel maps between 62.9 km  s@xmath0 and 104.1 km  s@xmath0 show a faint counterpart on the south - east side of the galaxy with a total mass of 1.7 @xmath12 10@xmath24 @xmath10 .",
    "all this gas at extreme anomalous velocities ( the ` forbidden ' gas ) seems to be confined to the region corresponding to the bright optical part of ngc  2403 ( see figure  [ fig8 ] , top left and bottom right panels ) . its overall kinematical pattern , as it appears in figure  [ fig7 ] , indicates that all the anomalous gas , including the forbidden one , forms one coherent structure , which closely follows the rotation of the system .    in the following",
    "we refer to all the gas at projected anomalous velocities with respect to the rotation curve ( beard + forbidden gas ) as the ` anomalous gas ' .",
    "we have attempted to separate the anomalous from the regular h  i assuming that the h  i profiles are formed by two components : 1 ) a narrow one of gaussian shape centred on the rotation velocity of the galaxy ( the cold disk ) , and 2 ) a broader one , mainly at lower rotation velocities and with unknown profile shape ( the anomalous gas ) .",
    "we have modelled the cold disk by fitting a gaussian function to the line profile after clipping the data at 30% of the peak . with this clipping",
    "we fit only the upper part of the profiles .",
    "the differences between the gaussian fit with and without the clipping are about 1 km  s@xmath0 for the value of the rotation velocity and about 3 km  s@xmath0 for the velocity dispersion . the velocity field and the distribution of the velocity dispersion of the cold disk ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , obtained with this gaussian fit ,",
    "have then been used to generate a ` gaussian cube ' that has been subtracted from the data leaving the residual anomalous gas .",
    "a second method has been tried to generate the gaussian cube for the cold disk by fitting half a gaussian to the high velocity side of the line profiles .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the anomalous gas does not contribute to the high velocity side of the line profile .",
    "the obtained half - gaussian has then been folded on the low velocity side of the profile and subtracted from the data .",
    "the results obtained with the two methods are very similar .      the velocity field and the map of the velocity dispersion of the cold disk are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the velocity field is regular and symmetric .",
    "the velocity dispersion has average values around 9@xmath110 km  s@xmath0 except in the central region and in the spiral arms where it reaches values of up to 10@xmath115 km  s@xmath0 ( darker grayscale ) .",
    "after correction for the instrumental resolution these values are about 1 km  s@xmath0 lower . in order to determine the kinematical parameters and the rotation curve of ngc  2403 we have performed the standard tilted ring fit of the velocity field @xcite .",
    "the rings have been fitted with a radial increment of 15@xmath5 .",
    "points were weighted by the cosine of the azimuthal angle with respect to the major axis . in the determination of the central position and the systemic velocity only the rings with radii smaller than 13 kpc were considered .",
    "the values derived for the position of the centre and for the systemic velocity are reported in table  [ tab3 ] . while keeping these parameters fixed , we proceeded to fit the position and inclination angles .",
    "the position angle ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) shows a clear deviation from the mean value in the central region between 2 and 4 kpc and remains constant out to about 15 kpc where it starts decreasing in the region of the warp .",
    "the inclination angle shows variations in the central region around a mean value of about 61@xmath3 .",
    "then it rises to more than 65@xmath3 beyond 15 kpc .",
    "the mean ( error weighted ) values for the position and the inclination angles were derived between 4 and 15 kpc and resulted in 124.5 @xmath14 0.6@xmath3 and 62.9 @xmath14 2.1@xmath3 respectively .",
    "the values obtained by @xcite were 123.9 and 60.9 degrees respectively while @xcite found 122.5 and 60.2 .",
    "the lower values for the inclination angle found by these authors agree with the value we get considering only the inner regions ( radii @xmath25 10 kpc ) of the disk .    while keeping the other parameters fixed , the rotation curve was derived separately for the approaching and receding side of the galaxy , as shown in the top left panel of figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the line shows the rotation curve obtained by @xcite .",
    "points beyond 20 kpc were determined using the velocity field at 30@xmath5 resolution . because of the large deviations of position and inclination angles from their mean values beyond 20 kpc they were left free to vary in the fit .",
    "the rotation curves for the two sides indicate a good overall symmetry except for the regions beyond 16 kpc where the approaching side has velocities 5@xmath110 km  s@xmath0 higher than the receding one .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] also shows the radial column density fitted with an exponential law for radii larger than 4 kpc ( the inferred h  i scalelength is 5.7 @xmath14 0.1 kpc ) , and the velocity dispersion derived with the formula @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the instrumental velocity resolution ( @xmath28  2 @xmath12 channel separation ) and @xmath29 is the @xmath6 of the gaussian function fitted to the clipped line profile .",
    "the derived velocity dispersion shows a decrease from the central values of @xmath2  12 km  s@xmath0 to values of @xmath2  8 km  s@xmath0 in the outer regions .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc  2403 was derived again by applying the tilted ring fitting to the velocity field of the whole galaxy . for points beyond 20 kpc",
    "we again used the smoothed data cube with no fixed position and inclination angles . as an estimate of the errors we took the difference in velocity between the approaching and receding side",
    "we have subsequently performed the standard analysis of the rotation curve with the decomposition into three mass components @xcite : the stellar disk , the gas disk , and the dark matter halo .",
    "no stellar bulge is visible in the optical luminosity profile @xcite . for the stellar disk we have taken the brightness profile published by @xcite",
    "while for the h  i profile we multiplied our data by a scale factor of 1.4 to take into account the helium abundance .",
    "we assumed a value of 0.4 kpc for the scale height of the stellar layer @xcite and 0.2 kpc for gas layer @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halo was modelled with the spherically symmetric density distribution @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the central density and @xmath32 is the core radius .    in figure  [ fig10 ]",
    "we show four different fits .",
    "the maximum disk model gives a scaling factor ( @xmath33 ) for the stellar component of 2.3 , the ` bottema disk ' model @xcite has a fixed @xmath33 of 1.4 , and the third model is the so - called maximum halo ( no stellar disk ) .",
    "the fourth panel shows a model with no dark matter halo and a free scale factor for stars and h  i ; we obtained an @xmath33 of 2.3 and a value of 9.9 for the h  i scaling factor , similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "the first three fits are comparable .",
    "note that the last model gives a higher discrepancy in the outer regions than found by hoekstra et al .",
    "2001 . however , this latter produces the best fit of the inner substructures of the rotation curve .",
    "the present rotation curve is more extended ( about 2 kpc ) than that by @xcite and does not show any sign of declining .",
    "the total dynamical mass inferred within a galactic radius of 22.5 kpc is 9.4 @xmath14 0.7 @xmath12 10@xmath34 @xmath10 .",
    "this value is consistent with that obtained by @xcite ( 8.4 @xmath14 0.4 @xmath12 10@xmath34 @xmath10 ) for a galactic radius of 20 kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows the p - v diagram for the anomalous gas along the major axis of ngc  2403 after the subtraction of the cold disk .",
    "the filled squares show the rotation curve derived for the cold disk .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows the distribution of the anomalous gas overlaid on the optical picture ( left panel ) .",
    "its outer radius is about 15@xmath116 kpc and the total h  i mass is @xmath2  3 @xmath12 10@xmath35 @xmath10 ( 1/10 of the total h  i mass of ngc  2403 , 0.3% of the total dynamical mass ) . for the velocity dispersion of the anomalous gas",
    "the data indicate values of 20@xmath150 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "where is this anomalous gas located in space with respect to the cold disk ? is it located above the disk , in the halo region ?",
    "the vertical extent of this gas layer is difficult to determine precisely because the inclination of the galaxy is not sufficiently high .",
    "schaap et al . ( 2000 ) using a 3d modelling of the gas layer arrived at possible values for its thickness between 1 and 3 kpc ( fwhm ) .",
    "similar values were found for the edge - on galaxy ngc  891 ( swaters et al .",
    "1997 ) whose h  i ` halo ' is probably a component similar to the anomalous gas in ngc  2403 .",
    "a similar modelling performed by us gives an upper limit for the thickness of the anomalous gas of about 3 kpc , while the thickness of the disk is presumably lower than 0.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "also from a dynamical point of view this separation into two systems of different thicknesses is natural as the anomalous gas and the cold disk , being collisional systems with separate kinematics , can not spatially co - exist in the same thin layer .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] ( right panel ) shows the intensity - weighted velocity field of the anomalous gas . clearly the kinematics is dominated , as for the cold disk , by differential rotation .",
    "the projected kinematical axes , however , appear to be rotated counter - clockwise with respect to those of the cold disk .",
    "this is more evident for the minor axis ( thick line ) .",
    "furthermore , the two axes are not orthogonal .",
    "this is a result of the asymmetric distribution of the anomalous gas already noted in the description of the p - v parallel to the minor axis of the galaxy ( section 2.2.1 ) .",
    "a simple explanation is that of an overall inflow of the anomalous gas towards the center of the galaxy @xcite .    we have explored the possibility of such a radial flow quantitatively using a tilted ring fit to the velocity field of the anomalous gas",
    "this was done by keeping the centre of the galaxy and the systemic velocity fixed to the values found for the cold disk .",
    "the resulting inclination angle is similar to that of the disk , but the position angle , as expected from the counter - clockwise rotation of kinematical axes , turns out to be significantly higher ( @xmath2  131@xmath3 ) . assuming such a rotation of the kinematical axes is indeed due to radial motions , we have included in the tilted ring model a radial component for the gas velocity . in order to decide about the sign of such radial motion @xmath1inflow or outflow@xmath1 it is necessary to know which is the near and which is the far side of the galaxy .",
    "we have taken the south - west side as the near side of ngc  2403 .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the spiral arms are trailing and is also supported by the presence of dust absorption features ( see optical images in sandage et al .",
    "keeping the position angle fixed to the value found for the cold disk ( 124.5 ) , the fit gives a radial flow velocity of @xmath113.6 @xmath14 1.2 km  s@xmath0 ( the minus sign means inflow ) from 4 to 15 kpc .",
    "is it possible that also the cold disk has a non - zero radial velocity ?",
    "we tested this possibility by considering both radial velocity and position angle as free parameters in the tilted ring fit to the velocity field of the cold disk .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] ( right panel ) shows the trend of radial velocity for both the disk and the anomalous gas obtained with this method .",
    "the mean values of radial velocity between 4 and 15 kpc are @xmath13.1 @xmath14 0.3 km  s@xmath0 and @xmath116.2 @xmath14 1.1 km  s@xmath0 for the disk and the anomalous gas respectively .",
    "thus the velocity field of the cold disk also shows a small distortion that could be explained as a weak radial inflow .",
    "however , an alternative and more likely interpretation for this distortion is that of triaxiality of the potential .",
    "indeed , the deviation from circular motion found here is comparable to that found by @xcite ( about 2 km  s@xmath0 ) with a fourier analysis of the orbits .",
    "such a weak triaxiality would , instead , be totally insufficient to account for the effect ( a factor of 10 greater ) observed for the anomalous gas .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] also shows the rotation curve of the disk compared with the mean rotation velocity of the anomalous gas .",
    "the difference is about 25 km  s@xmath0 in the outer parts , increasing to 40@xmath150 km  s@xmath0 in the inner regions .",
    "table  [ tab4 ] summarizes the properties of the h  i disk and of the anomalous gas for ngc  2403 .",
    "we have presented new , deep h  i observations of the spiral galaxy ngc  2403 .",
    "these have been used to study the structure of the gas layer and the dynamics of the system .",
    "the main results are briefly summarized here .    a new faint , extended gas component with anomalous velocities has been detected .",
    "this h  i component ( the ` anomalous gas ' ) shows up in the line profiles as broad wings at velocities lower than rotation and partly also at forbidden ( non - circular ) velocities . such wings are not explained by inclination effects , pure thickness or poor angular resolution , but result from the presence of a thick layer of h  i which rotates more slowly than the gas in the plane ( see also schaap et al .",

    "we have separated the anomalous gas from the thin disk of cold h  i assuming a gaussian profile for the latter .",
    "the anomalous h  i has a mass of about 3  @xmath12 10@xmath35 @xmath10 ( 1/10 of the total h  i mass ) , a mean rotation velocity 25@xmath150 km  s@xmath0 lower than that of the disk , and a radial inflow of 10@xmath120 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the origin of this gas is still a matter of debate .",
    "the main issue is whether it is the result of processes taking place in the system itself or whether it could be infall of extragalactic , possibly primordial gas ( cf .",
    "oort 1970 ) .",
    "the overall kinematical pattern of the anomalous gas , its highly coherent structure and its close connection with the disk of ngc 2403 seem to point at an internal origin .",
    "indeed , there may be a close relation with the process of active star formation going on in the disk of ngc 2403 and a galactic fountain type of mechanism may provide the explanation for both its origin and its dynamics .",
    "however , the detection of h  i at forbidden velocities ( more than 130 km  s@xmath0 from rotation ) and the presence of coherent structures with sizes up to 8 kpc , are puzzling . considering the large velocity dispersion ( about 20@xmath150 km  s@xmath0 ) and the lower rotation velocities found for the anomalous h  i , it is tempting to describe what we see here in terms of a large asymmetric drift of a thick and clumpy gas layer .",
    "the results of the present h  i observations of ngc  2403 have also interesting implications regarding the high velocity clouds observed in the milky way @xcite whose distances , nature and origin are still a matter of debate .",
    "it is possible that the anomalous h  i complexes discovered in ngc  2403 are analogous to the hvcs seen in the galaxy , or at least to a class of them .",
    "consider for instance the 8  kpc filament , the largest structure found in ngc  2403 , with a projected velocity difference from the rotation of 60@xmath1100 km  s@xmath0 and an h  i mass of about 1 @xmath12 10@xmath18 @xmath10 .",
    "if viewed from inside ngc  2403 it would probably appear to have a large angular size similar to that of some extended hvc complexes e.g.  the well known complex c @xcite . to be as massive as the filament in ngc  2403",
    ", complex c would have to be as far as 15 kpc from us , compatible with the observational lower limits @xcite .",
    "such a distance would also be of the same order as the distance ( between 4 and 10 kpc ) estimated for complex a @xcite that shows several similarities with complex c. the fact that ngc  2403 is a normal , non - interacting spiral galaxy suggests that the h  i features discovered here may be common among spiral galaxies and that , perhaps , they have not been detected yet because of the low sensitivity of previous surveys .",
    "apart from the investigation of the newly discovered anomalous gas component , the present observations have also been used for the study of the dynamics of ngc 2403 .",
    "the main results are the finding of an extended , highly asymmetrical warp of the h  i outer layer and the derivation of a new rotation curve .",
    "this has been analyzed with the standard decomposition technique and the main results on the disk and the dark matter halo are similar to those already obtained by @xcite .",
