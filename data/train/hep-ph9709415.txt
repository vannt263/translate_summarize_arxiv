    "low energy photon - photon scattering is a textbook example of a process which can be described using an effective interaction , the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the precise form of this lagrangian ( given below ) can be obtained by expanding the box diagrams for photon - photon scattering in powers of the photon energy over the electron mass , @xmath3 , and keeping the first non - vanishing term , which is of order @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to the cross section @xmath5 with its characteristic @xmath6 dependence on the photon energy . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the cosine of the scattering angle .",
    "the energy scale in this case is @xmath1 , a result of ` integrating out ' the heavy degree of of freedom , the electron , to obtain an effective interaction .",
    "there are compelling arguments suggesting that effective interactions can be used to define effective field theories which are adequate descriptions of nature if one accepts a reasonable set of assumptions about the renormalization program @xcite . with these assumptions , it is possible to obtain finite corrections to physical processes from the ( ordinarily divergent ) contributions calculated by using the effective interactions in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the price for extracting these finite corrections is the introduction of local counterterms whose couplings are not known _",
    "a priori_. it is , however , clear that the counterterms introduce corrections of higher order in the ratio of the energy to the energy scale .    the implications of this approach can be explored using the laboratory of photon - photon scattering as is evident from the plot of the total cross section given in fig.1 @xcite . here",
    ", it can be seen that the @xmath6 behavior persists up to @xmath8 0.4 @xmath1 or so , at which point the slope increases indicating the presence of higher powers of @xmath0 .",
    "our purpose is to compute the one - loop corrections to low energy photon - photon scattering amplitude using the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian with the appropriate counterterms and to compare this result with that obtained by expanding the _ exact _ amplitude in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "this will enable us to better understand how an effective field theory mimics a full field theory in a situation where explicit calculations in both approaches are feasible .",
    "the full euler - heisenberg lagrangian describing photon self interactions is an expansion in powers of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath9 .",
    "assuming parity conservation , it can be expressed in terms of the two independent , gauge invariant combinations @xmath10 and @xmath11 . due to the antisymmetry of @xmath9 ,",
    "scalars formed from a odd number of field tensors vanish . for a one - loop calculation",
    ", it suffices to use the terms @xmath12 \\nonumber \\\\ &    & + \\frac{1}{315}\\frac{\\pi\\alpha^3}{m_e^8}\\left[9\\ ; \\left(f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\mu\\nu}\\right)^3   - 26\\;f_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\nu\\lambda}f_{\\lambda\\rho}f^{\\rho\\mu } f_{\\alpha\\beta}f^{\\alpha\\beta}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the one - loop contribution of the order @xmath13 term in eq.([e - h ] ) to the photon - photon scattering amplitude , obtained by contracting a pair of @xmath9 s , actually vanishes by dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "this leaves only the @xmath14 one - loop contribution from the first term of eq.([e - h ] ) used in the second order of perturbation theory . because the photons are massless , all the loop integrals , which take the form @xmath15 @xmath16 , are proportional to the scalar integral @xmath17 multiplied by a polynomial in the momentum @xmath18 .",
    "evaluating @xmath19 using a cutoff @xmath20 , we find @xmath21    in second order , the @xmath22 term in eq.([e - h ] ) has @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 channel contributions , illustrated in fig.2 . as a consequence , the one - loop correction to the helicity amplitudes can be written @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since the vertex functions resulting from @xmath30 are quite complicated @xcite , the programs schoonschip @xcite and form @xcite were used to perform the algebraic manipulations .",
    "the explicit forms of the @xmath31 are given in table i. in order to isolate the cutoff dependence , we introduce a renormalization scale @xmath32 and rewrite eq.([amps ] ) as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is obtained from eq.([amps ] ) by replacing @xmath35 with @xmath36 in @xmath37 .",
    "the sums of the various helicity combinations are given in the last row of table i.    to complete the interpretation of the cutoff - dependent terms in eq .",
    "( [ renamp ] ) as contributions to coupling constant renormalization , it is necessary to show that they can be obtained as matrix elements of local , gauge invariant operators .",
    "in addition to four @xmath9 s , these operators must contain four derivatives in order to produce the @xmath38 behavior .",
    "finding them is something of a trial and error process .",
    "there are many tensors which can be formed with the required properties , but most of them are not independent .",
    "the forms given below are sufficient to reproduce the helicity amplitudes in the last row of table i. @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effective lagrangian @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then gives a finite matrix element for elastic scattering at the one - loop level provided the cutoff dependent terms represented by eq.([counter ] ) are interpreted as renormalizations of the coupling constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the leading @xmath6 dependence of the low energy cross section follows from the fact that the terms in eq.([e - h ] ) involving four field tensors are of dimension 8 .",
    "thus , the amplitudes go as @xmath43 and , from qed or using eq.([e - h ] ) , one can obtain the helicity amplitudes @xcite given in the first row of table ii .",
    "the remaining amplitudes are equal to these by parity and time reversal .",
    "equation([sig0 ] ) follows by taking the sum of the squares of the @xmath44 .",
    "table iii compares the total cross section , as calculated approximately by integrating eq.([sig0 ] ) over @xmath7 , @xmath45 with the full one loop qed expression calculated by using a rapidly converging series for the spence functions @xcite and performing a numerical integration over @xmath7 .",
    "as can be seen , eq.([xsec4 ] ) provides a reasonable approximation for @xmath46 .",
    "again , corrections to eqs.([sig0 ] ) or ( [ xsec4 ] ) can only involve effective interactions with derivatives acting on four factors of @xmath9 and , by lorentz invariance , must involve an even number of derivatives . thus the helicity amplitudes and therefore the cross section are expansions in @xmath2 .",
    "for comparison purposes , we have calculated the terms of order @xmath6 and @xmath38 by expanding the electron box diagrams of qed .",
    "the results are given in the second and third rows of table ii .",
    "these amplitudes add terms to eq.([sig0 ] ) which becomes @xmath47\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the contribution from the square of the @xmath43 amplitude , the second term is the cross term between the amplitudes of order @xmath43 with those of order @xmath6 , the third term consists of the square of the @xmath6 amplitudes and the cross terms between the @xmath43 amplitudes and those of order @xmath38 . the corresponding total cross section is @xmath48\\,.\\ ] ] the last column of table iii gives the ratio of eq.([xsec6 ] ) to the full one loop cross section .",
    "inclusion of the second and third terms in eq.([xsec6 ] ) provides a very good approximation , all the way to @xmath49 .",
    "as mentioned above , the helicity amplitudes in the first row of table ii can be obtained from the effective lagrangian @xmath50\\,.\\ ] ] in order to generalize this expression to reproduce the @xmath6 and @xmath38 corrections , it is necessary to construct terms containing two or four additional derivatives acting on a combination of four @xmath9 s to produce a scalar .",
    "terms with four derivatives were encountered in the discussion of the one - loop corrections and suffice to describe the @xmath38 terms found here . the enumeration of the terms with two derivatives can be done similarly and we find that @xmath51 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gives the @xmath6 correction and @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gives the @xmath38 correction .",
    "the expansion of the photon - photon scattering amplitude can thus be obtained by computing the matrix element of the local effective lagrangian @xmath53 , and it is accurate for photon energies very close to the energy scale @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "by using the euler - heisenberg largangian , eq.([e - h ] ) , to the one - loop level in perturbation theory we obtained an expansion of the low energy photon - photon scattering amplitude containing terms of order @xmath4 and @xmath54 . since there is no contribution of order @xmath55 , it is not necessary to introduce a counterterm to ensure renormalizability in this order .",
    "this situation is not peculiar to the one - loop approximation .",
    "an @xmath55 correction can not be generated by retaining more terms in the euler - heisenberg expansion or by including perturbative corrections with more than one loop . while we do obtain finite one - loop terms of order @xmath54 , these are higher order in @xmath56 and thus should be negligible numerically .",
    "in fact , the discussion of the order @xmath54 is essentially complete .",
    "the only other potential @xmath38 correction to the elastic amplitude is associated with term in the euler - heisenberg expansion which consists of products of eight field tensors , but this contribution also vanishes by dimensional regulation .",
    "this situation should be compared with the result of expanding the exact qed amplitude in powers of @xmath2 . here",
    ", one obtains , as expected , the same @xmath4 term , as well as an @xmath55 term and an @xmath54 correction which is not suppressed by additional powers of @xmath56 .",
    "the existence of a leading order ( in @xmath56 ) @xmath54 correction in the qed expansion can be accommodated in the effective field theory approach by an appropriate choice of the renormalized couplings @xmath57 of eq.([lcount ] ) .",
    "there is still a difference between the energy dependence derived from qed and that implied by simply requiring the renormalizability of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "this fact does not seem to be in conflict with the spirit of effective field theory , since it is always possible to add interactions such as those in eq.([leff1 ] ) to recover the @xmath6 dependence .",
    "one can not , however , restrict the number of such terms by appealing to renormalizability .",
