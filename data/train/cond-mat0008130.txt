    "the underlying nonlinearity can induce the system to exhibit a complex behavior with quite structured paths in the phase space .",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions is a relevant aspect associated to the structure of the dynamical attractor . in general , the sensitivity is measured as the effect of any uncertainty on the system s variables . for systems exhibiting periodic or chaotic orbits , the effect of any uncertainty on initial conditions depicts an exponential temporal evolution with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lyapunov exponent , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the uncertainties at times @xmath5 and @xmath6 . when the lyapunov exponent @xmath7 , @xmath8 characterizes the rate of contraction towards periodic orbits . on the other hand , for @xmath9 , it characterizes the rate of divergence of chaotic orbits . at bifurcation and critical points ( i.e. , onset to chaos ) the lyapunov exponent @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "recently , it was shown that this feature is related to a power - law sensitivity to initial conditions on the form@xcite      with @xmath11 defining a characteristic time scale after which the power - law behavior sets up .",
    "a quantitative way to measure the sensitivity to initial conditions is to follow , from a particular partition of the phase space , the temporal evolution of the number of cells @xmath0 occupied by an ensemble of identical copies of the system . for periodic and chaotic orbits @xmath12 . in the particular case of equiprobability ,",
    "the well - known pesin equality reads @xmath13 if @xmath14@xcite with @xmath15 being the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite defined as the variation per unit time of the standard boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath16 .",
    "this equality provides a link between the sensitivity to initial conditions and the dynamic evolution of the relevant entropy .",
    "the expansion towards the critical attractor of an ensemble of initial conditions concentrated around the inflexion point of the map can be characterized by a proper @xmath23 evolving at a constant rate .",
    "scaling arguments have shown that the appropriate entropic index @xmath24 is related to the multifractal structure of the critical dynamical attractor by@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the extremal singularity strengths of the multifractal spectrum of the critical attractor@xcite .",
    "the above scaling relation has been shown to hold for the families of generalized logistic and circle maps@xcite .    however , the temporal evolution of critical dynamical systems can be strongly dependent on the particular initial ensemble .",
    "although some scaling laws can be found for an ensemble of initial conditions concentrated around the map inflexion point , these are usually not universal with respect to a general ensemble . in this work , we are going to numerically investigate the critical temporal evolution of the volume of the phase space occupied by an ensemble of initial conditions spread over the entire phase space .",
    "this ensemble is expected to contract towards the critical attractor . using a family of one - dimensional generalized logistic maps having @xmath28",

    "in particular the fractal dimension of the critical attractor @xmath33@xcite and therefore it does not fill a finite fraction of the phase space . for a set of initial conditions spread in the vicinity of the inflexion point , it was found that the volume in phase space occupied by the ensemble grows following a rich pattern with the upper bounds @xmath34 governed by a power - law @xmath35 , where @xmath24 is the entropic index characterizing the relevant tsallis entropy that grows at a constant rate .",
    "it has been shown that the dynamic exponent @xmath36 is directly related to geometric scaling exponents related to the extremal sets of the dynamic attractor@xcite .    due to the presence of long - range spatial and temporal correlations at criticality",

    "indeed , the multifractal spectrum characterizing the critical dynamical attractor indicates that an infinite set of exponents are needed to fully characterize the scaling behavior .",
    "in particular , an ensemble consisting of a set of identical systems whose initial conditions is spread over the entire phase - space is a common one when studying non - linear as well as thermodynamical systems .    here , we will follow the dynamic evolution , in phase space , of an ensemble of initial conditions uniformly distributed over the phase - space and explore its relation with the generalized fractal dimensions of the critical attractor . in practice",

    "saturates at a finite fraction corresponding to the phase space volume occupied by the critical attractor on a given finite partition .",
    "the saturation is postponed when a finer partition is used once the fraction occupied by the critical attractor vanishes in the limit @xmath50 .    in figure  2",
    ", we show @xmath47 for a given fine partition of the phase - space and distinct sampling ratios @xmath51 .",
    "we notice that the crossover regime to the power - law scaling is quite short for large values of @xmath51 so that a clear power - law scaling regime sets up even at early times .",
    "this feature is consistent with eq.(7 ) which states that the crossover time @xmath52 scales as @xmath53 .",
    "further , the scaling regime exhibits log - periodic oscillations once the multifractal nature of the critical attractor is closely probed by such dense ensemble .",
    "a general form for @xmath0 reflecting the discrete scale invariance of the attractor can be written as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is a function of period unity and @xmath2 is the characteristic scaling factor between the periods of two consecutive oscillations .",

    "the factors controlling the log - periodic relative amplitude @xmath60 are not well known for most of the systems where it has been observed . in the present study",
    ", we can closely investigate the factors which may control these amplitudes by measuring it as a function of the map inflexion @xmath31 for a fixed partition and sampling ratio ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we found that these oscillations have amplitudes decaying exponentially with @xmath31 as shown in figure  4 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the fractal dimension of the attractor is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the above trend indicates a possible correlation between the amplitude of the log - periodic oscillations and the fractal dimension of the dynamical attractor .",
    "we also measured the critical exponent @xmath61 as a function of the map inflexion @xmath31 .",
    "our results are summarized in the table .",
    "it is a decreasing function of @xmath31 as can be seen in figure  5 .",
    "the volume occupied by the ensemble depicts a fast contraction for @xmath62 where the fractal dimension is small . on the other side ,",
    "a very slow contraction is observed for large values of @xmath31 , pointing towards a saturation or at most to a logarithmic decrease of @xmath0 in the limit of dense attractors .",
    "we would like to point out here that the exponent governing the expansion of the volume occupied by an ensemble of initial conditions concentrated around the inflexion point exhibits a reversed trend .",
    "although scaling arguments have shown that this exponent can be written in terms of scaling exponents characterizing the extremal sets in the attractor , we could not devise a simple scaling relation between @xmath61 and the multifractal singularity spectrum .",
    "however , we observed that , when plotted against the fractal dimension of the attractor as shown in figure  6 , the dynamic exponent @xmath61 is very well fitted by @xmath63 , which indicates @xmath64 as the relevant geometric exponent coupled to the dynamics of the uniform ensemble .",
    "we would like to mention here that the same dynamic exponents were obtained for the generalized periodic maps which belong to the same universality class of logistic - like maps@xcite .",
    "the results from the previous section indicate that a slow convergence to the critical attractor shall be expected for dense critical attractors . however , it is not clear in what fashion this convergence will take place when the dynamical attractor fills the phase space with a multifractal probability density as occurs for the one - dimensional critical circle map    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a point on a circle .",
    "the circle map describes dynamical systems possessing a natural frequency @xmath67 which are driven by an external force of frequency @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the bare winding number ) and belongs to the same universality class of the forced rayleigh - bnard convection@xcite . for @xmath70",
    "the circle map has a cubic inflexion ( @xmath71 ) in the vicinity of the point @xmath72 .",
    "starting from a given point on the circle , it generates a quasi - periodic orbit which fills the phase - space and the dynamical attractor is a multifractal with fractal dimension @xmath29@xcite .    in figure  7",
    "we show our results for the temporal evolution of the phase - space volume occupied by an ensemble of initial conditions uniformly spread over the circle .",
    "@xmath0 exhibits a rich pattern which resembles the one observed for the sensitivity function associated to the expansion of the phase - space from initial conditions concentrated around the inflexion point .",
    "however , @xmath0 does not present any power - law regime . instead",
    ", the lower bounds display a slow logarithmic decrease with time , saturating at a finite volume fraction .",
    "the saturation is a feature related to the finite partition used in the numerical calculation .",
    "this minimum decreases logarithmically with the number of cells in the phase - space as shown in figure  8 .",
    "we also observed the same behavior for generalized circle maps with an arbitrary inflexion @xmath31@xcite .",
    "the critical attractors within this family have all @xmath29 although they exhibit a @xmath31-dependent multifractal singularity spectra .",
    "the @xmath31-independent scenario for @xmath0 corroborates the conjecture that @xmath64 is the relevant geometric exponent coupled to the dynamics of the uniform ensemble .",
    "in this work , we studied the temporal evolution in phase space of an ensemble of identical copies of one - dimensional nonlinear dissipative maps .",
    "we found that the phase - space volume occupied by an initially uniform ensemble displays a power - law decay with log - periodic oscillations whenever the dynamical attractor has a fractal dimension @xmath28 , i.e. , when the fractal attractor does not densely fill the phase space .",
    "generally , these oscillations also emerge in open high - dimensional systems operating at a self - organized critical state .",
    "the spatio - temporal long - range correlations present on the critical state reflect the scale invariance of the dynamical attractor .",
    "therefore , the present work corroborates the concept that the fractal nature of the dynamical attractor and the presence of a characteristic scaling factor are key ingredients for the emergence of log - periodic oscillations@xcite.the amplitude of the oscillations was found to depict a monotonic parametric dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "for dense multifractal attractors , @xmath0 presents only a slow logarithmic contraction of its lower bounds followed by a rich pattern .",
    "the critical exponent characterizing the contraction of the uniform ensemble was found to have no direct relation to the one governing the expansion from a set of initial conditions concentrated around the inflexion point . in particular , no power - law was found for the contraction in the standard and generalized circle maps , in contrast to the @xmath31-dependent power - law expansion .",
    "these results indicate that the relevant tsallis entropy evolving at a constant rate ( modulated by log - periodic oscillations ) is characterized by an entropic index @xmath24 that depends on the initial ensemble",
    ". it would be valuable to investigate the possible existence of classes of ensembles with a common dynamics in phase - space and , therefore , characterized by the same entropic index @xmath24 .",
    "the non - universality of @xmath24 with respect to the initial ensemble is related to the multifractal character of the dynamical attractor . however , as for the ensemble concentrated at the vicinity of the inflexion point , the exponent governing the dynamics of the uniform ensemble is coupled to a geometric scaling exponent , in particular to the proper fractal dimension of the attractor .",
    "extensive numerical work would be valuable to verify the validity of the proposed relation on higher - dimensional systems . in any case",
    ", the present results come in favor of the concept that the degree of nonextensivity of the entropy measure evolving at a constant rate is related to the fractal nature of the dynamical attractor .",
