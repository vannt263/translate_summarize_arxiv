    "computing the thermodynamic pressure of the gauge field theories , defined by the path integral @xmath0),\\ ] ] has attracted a lot of interest over the years . in addition to being an interesting computation in itself , pressure is a phenomenologically important quantity when trying to understand the properties of quark - gluon plasma produced in heavy - ion collisions ( relevant physics being described by qcd ) and also in cosmology ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in qcd with massless quarks ,",
    "the expansion of the pressure in terms of the gauge coupling @xmath1 is known today to the last perturbatively computable term @xcite . in the full standard model ,",
    "the pressure is less well known , the interest having been focused on the properties of the electroweak phase transition ( crossover ) which depend only on the pressure difference between the phases of the theory . in this talk",
    ", we will review our recent computation of the pressure of the full minimal standard model to three loop order , or to order @xmath2 in the coupling constants .",
    "we will also outline some of the differences arising in the computations of the qcd pressure and the full standard model pressure .",
    "as well known , straightforward perturbative computations in gauge field theories at high temperatures are inhibited by infrared divergences that require resummation @xcite . a convenient way to perform",
    "the resummation is to construct effective field theories for the infrared sensitive modes ( the bosonic zero modes ) by integrating out the infrared safe modes ( see @xcite for details ) . in case of the standard model",
    ", the resulting effective theory will be a three dimensional gauge field theory with fundamental ( higgs ) and adjoint ( temporal components of the gauge fields , corresponding to the electrostatic modes of the full theory ) scalars , defined by the action @xmath3 in this theory , the scalars have obtained thermal masses ( @xmath4 for the higgs and @xmath5 for the adjoint scalars , @xmath6 to express all order of magnitude estimates in terms of the single gauge coupling @xmath7 .",
    "] ) that serve to regulate ( some of ) the infrared divergences .    within this framework , assuming for now that the temperature is well above the temperatures corresponding to the electroweak crossover , the recipe for calculating the pressure is :    * compute the strict perturbative expansion of the pressure in the full theory , schematically giving us ( using dimensional regularization , @xmath8 ) @xmath9,\\ ] ] leaving uncancelled infrared divergences at order @xmath10 ( three loop order ) . *",
    "construct the three dimensional effective theory for the bosonic zero modes and compute its pressure , schematically @xmath11 here @xmath12 refers both to @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    the total pressure is then given as the sum of these two contributions , @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 poles in @xmath18 exactly cancel those of @xmath19 , thus making @xmath20 infrared finite .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the qcd pressure becomes unreliable at temperatures near @xmath21 because confinement effects become important ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the landau pole of the electroweak theory , however , corresponds to a length scale comparable to the radius of the earth and one can therefore expect the confinement effects to be negligible in the electroweak case , enabling us to extend the perturbative computations all the way down to the electroweak crossover .",
    "near the crossover region the fundamental scalar , which drives the transition , becomes light compared to the adjoint scalars , thus introducing a new mass hierarchy to the system .",
    "consequently , the computation outlined above becomes invalid since it implicitly assumes that both the fundamental and the adjoint scalars can be considered heavy with masses @xmath23 . however , since the adjoint scalars are now heavy compared to the fundamental scalar , they can be integrated out leading to a new effective theory describing just the fundamental scalar and the magnetic components of the gauge bosons , @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( valid near the crossover ) .",
    "the contribution of the effective theories to the pressure is then divided into two parts : contribution from the adjoint scalars , @xmath26 , and the contribution from the remaining degrees of freedom , @xmath27 .",
    "these can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 since the fundamental scalar becomes light near the crossover , new infrared divergences ( terms @xmath30 ) appear that cancel only when the contribution from the second effective theory @xmath31 is taken into account .",
    "it is noteworthy that the new poles appear at order @xmath2 , thus leading to terms of the order of @xmath32 in the expansion of the full pressure .",
    "such terms are not present in the expansion of the qcd pressure .",
    ".,width=283 ]      the detailed analytic expression of the expansion of the pressure is given in @xcite and we will here content to reviewing some numerical results obtained from that . in fig .  [",
    "fig : pressure ] we have plotted the expansion at different orders in @xmath7 , normalized to the pressure of ideal gas of massless particles @xmath33 . the result deviates strongly from the ideal gas result , up to as much as 15% . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", such a departure from the ideal gas result may affect the predictions concerning the wimp relic density in the universe .",
    "as can also be seen from the plot , the expansion does not converge well ; the order @xmath2 term produces a significant correction to the pressure compared to the previous terms .",
    "the poor convergence is mostly due to the qcd contributions ( of the 106.75 bosonic degrees of freedom in the standard model , 79 come from qcd ) . to analyze the convergence within the electroweak sector , we can study a simpler su(2 ) + higgs theory . as can be seen from the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure2 ] , also normalized to the ideal gas pressure , the expansion within just the electroweak sector converges better : each new term in the expansion is smaller than the previous one .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached by studying the scale dependence of the expansion .",
    "as we approach the crossover region , the high temperature computation ceases to be valid as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this can be explicitly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] .",
    "the high temperature expansion of the pressure ( denoted by @xmath34 in the plot ) contains an unphysical singularity due to the infrared divergences which appear when @xmath35 . taking into account that the higgs scalar becomes light near the crossover",
    ", the expansion behaves well all the way down to the electroweak crossover ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this result can therefore be used for a precise determination of the expansion rate of the universe near the electroweak crossover , which is important in many cosmological studies .",
