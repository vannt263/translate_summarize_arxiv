    "anderson s theorem tells us that the s - wave superconductivity is insensitive to small potential scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "the d - wave superconductivity has zero superconducting gap in the nodal direction , and thus may be sensitive to disorder .",
    "however , experimental observation of the high - temperature superconductivity , which many people are nowadays convinced has d - wave symmetry , seems robust against disorder .",
    "for example , local density of states measured by the stm @xcite show clear v - shape at low energy that indicates the d - wave nodes are not much influenced by disorder .",
    "theoretically , it is proposed that this protection of v - shape is due to strong coulomb repulsion between electrons @xcite .",
    "hence detailed studies of effects of strong correlation for impurity scattering are necessary , and in this paper we focus on it .    in the gutzwiller approximation ,",
    "the model parameters are replaced by renormalized ones in return for taking the intractable projection operator away",
    ". then , @xmath1-term is renormalized by a factor @xmath5 because hopping is more difficult in the presence of projection . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4-term is renormalized by @xmath6 because each site is more often singly occupied . in this paper , we focus on another term ; how are impurity terms renormalized ?",
    "we use @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 model with an impurity term , namely , @xmath7",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 for nearest , second , third neighbors , respectively , and otherwise zero .",
    "the summation in the @xmath4 term is taken over every nearest - neighbor pair .",
    "the gutzwiller projection operator @xmath11 prohibits electron double occupancy at every site . throughout this paper",
    "we take @xmath12 and the hole density @xmath13 .",
    "we put an impurity at @xmath14 . here , we try three different types of the impurity term and compare them : ( i ) impurity potential , @xmath15 ( ii ) local @xmath1 variation , @xmath16 ( iii ) local @xmath4 variation , @xmath17",
    "we solve a bogoljubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation using the gutzwilller approximation with local gutzwiller factors and local chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "let us assume that a good variational ground state can be represented in the form of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents a state obtained by solving a bdg equation .",
    "the projection @xmath20 includes @xmath21 and an operator to control the particle number .    the gutzwiller approximation assuming that the average of the local electron density @xmath22 is not changed by the projection , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath23 gives the local gutzwiller factors as @xmath24 @xmath25 where the local hole density @xmath26 .",
    "here , @xmath27 denotes the expectation value by @xmath19 . from the extremum condition",
    "the free energy , the following bogoljubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation is derived : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are real numbers and that @xmath33 .",
    "the local chemical potential @xmath34 is the derivative of the internal energy with respect to the local hole density , @xmath35 we use a supercell composed of 20@xmath3620 sites whose origin is an impurity site .",
    "this supercell is repeated to construct a superlattice of 10@xmath3610 supercells with the periodic boundary condition @xcite .",
    "then , the hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized by the fourier transform with respect to the supercell indices , and calculation of expectation values is reduced to an average over many twisted boundary conditions of the 20@xmath3620 site system .",
    "let us start from impurity type ( i ) , namely , the impurity potential . as mentioned in eq .",
    "( [ eq : niconserve ] ) , @xmath37 is not renormalized by any @xmath38 factor by definition .",
    "however , as one can see in the bdg hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdg ] ) , the impurity potential can be compensated by @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we define a renormalized impurity potential by including difference of @xmath39 , namely , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the local chemical potential at the site farthest from @xmath14 .    figure 1 shows @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 . note that @xmath42 is strongly suppressed , and the renormalization factor seems about the order of @xmath44 which is plotted by a dotted line for comparison . in our understanding , it can be explained as follows : basically , impurity sites are uncomfortable for electrons to stay at . however , under strong electron correlation , everywhere is uncomfortable and impurity sites may be less uncomfortable compared to the systems without correlation .",
    "this effect appears as compensation of the impurity potential by local chemical potentials .",
    "next , in order to see the influence from the type-(ii ) and ( iii ) impurity , we plot the local electron density along @xmath45-axis in fig .  2 . here ,",
    "2(a ) is for the type-(ii ) impurity with @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath1 is smaller ( larger ) locally , the electron density near the impurity site is higher ( lower ) .",
    "therefore , effective @xmath47 , namely , @xmath48 , is further smaller ( larger ) .",
    "this should be because the system try to gain energy by increasing local gutzwiller factor at large @xmath1 region .",
    "namely , this defect is enhanced by the strong correlation",
    ".    we also find similar behavior for type-(iii ) impurity as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , where @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath4 is smaller ( larger ) locally , the electron density near the impurity site is lower ( higher ) , and @xmath50 , is further smaller ( larger ) .",
    "however , the magnitude of the enhancement is much smaller than that in fig .",
    "this should be because @xmath51 is much smaller than @xmath52 , and the effect by local electron density modification is also much smaller in the @xmath4 variation than in the @xmath1 variation .",
