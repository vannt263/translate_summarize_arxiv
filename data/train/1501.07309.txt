    "aperture synthesis interferometers are now a common instrument in astronomy that map sources on small angular scales .",

    "the typical understanding of how interferometers work is based on the fourier transforms of the electric field ",
    "first in time , then in space @xcite .",
    "interferometers have been used for decades now , particularly in radio astronomy , where the long wavelengths lead to low angular resolution @xcite .",
    "normally , diffraction limits the resolution of a single - dish telescope with diameter @xmath0 observing radiation with wavelength @xmath1 to @xmath2 . but a pair of receivers in an interferometer measure the fourier mode of the angular distribution of radiation on the sky with characteristic angles @xmath3 if @xmath4 is the separation of the receivers . each measured mode  from each pair of receivers  corresponds to a point on the @xmath5 plane , which is basically the fourier transform of the beam shape .",
    "a single dish telescope can be viewed as a filled - in array of receivers that measures all of the fourier modes within a disk of the @xmath5 plane .",
    "while a pair of interferometers provides only sparse information , more detailed geometrical information can be reconstructed by using an array of @xmath6 interferometers ( with @xmath7 pairs ) , using earth s rotation to rotate the @xmath5 plane , or using a spread of different frequencies .",
    "although early interferometers actually channeled radiation from receivers to a central location ( for example , through waveguides ) to be correlated , with modern technology , the field amplitude at each receiver can simply be recorded digitally .",
    "then , the signals can be processed numerically later to reconstruct the image .",
    "digital processing of this kind is necessary for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , where the receivers can be separated by thousands of kilometers @xcite .",
    "it is the method of choice for new or upgraded radio telescopes , including the karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) @xcite , the giant metre - wave radio telescope ( gmrt ) @xcite , the allen telescope array ( ata ) @xcite , and the low frequency array ( lofar ) @xcite .",
    "digital aperture synthesis is now enabling several arrays that are designed to detect 21 cm emission from the high - redshift intergalactic medium @xcite , among which are the donald c. backer precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ) @xcite , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) @xcite , the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) @xcite , and meerkat @xcite .",
    "these are currently intended to be pathfinders for the proposed square kilometer array ( ska ) , a global observatory intended to be built in the 2020s @xcite .",
    "the fast fourier transform telescope ( fftt ; @xcite ) is a refinement of digital interferometers .",
    "the original proposal calls for a large @xmath8 rectangular grid of simple dipole receivers ( @xmath9 total ) with spacing @xmath10 .",
    "the gridding of the antennas allows the electric field to be transformed with the fast fourier transform ( fft ) in only @xmath11 operations @xcite .",
    "the fftt can map radio emission on angular scales ranging from the whole sky to @xmath12 radians .",
    "it is thus ideal for measuring moderate to large brightness features over vast fields , the principle requirement for 21 cm reionization studies .",
    "the array of dipole antennas at the maip radio astronomy observatory was an analog version of the fftt , although there were only 6 independent rows of antennas @xcite .",
    "the waseda fft telescope is another early implementation of the fftt , with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the fftt can be simplified into the fractal `` omniscope '' which is a nested series of grids while still providing resolutions over a wide range of scales @xcite .",
    "one of the low frequency pathfinders , the mit epoch of reionization ( miteor ) telescope , is the first modern omniscope to be built @xcite .",
    "but fundamentally , why do we use the fourier transform in both time and space ?",
    "cosines and sines are not the only possible basis for representing functions .",
    "in fact , the fourier transform is only one of a whole family of transformations , the linear canonical transforms ( lcts ) .",
    "these transforms do have physical meanings , which will be explored in this paper .",
    "they can perform any area- and orientation - preserving linear mapping on space - frequency phase space : rotations , squeezing , and shearing . nor are we limited to lcts : we could express the electric field as the linear sum of any set of basis functions , such as wavelets or pulses . in principle",
    ", even more general non - linear transforms could be performed digitally .",
    "understanding the meaning of these other transforms provides insight into how interferometry and beamforming works .",
    "although i have chosen to center my discussion on astronomical interferometers , the basic ideas apply whenever beamforming is used to receive or broadcast a signal .",
    "beamforming , of course , is the main principle behind phased array antennas , which are used in radar detection . nor is beamforming limited to electromagnetic radiation , but it also is used frequently with sound waves , such as sonar .    a note on notation : throughout this paper , i use @xmath14 to refer to the dirac delta function",
    ", @xmath15 refers to @xmath16 , and an overline over a variable represents its complex conjugate .",
    "interferometers exploit the phases of arriving electromagnetic waves to reconstruct the direction the radiation is coming from .",
    "consider polarized monochromatic electromagnetic waves emanating from a single direction @xmath17 on the sky .",
    "the electric field at a point @xmath18 and time @xmath19 is @xmath20\\ ] ] if the wavelength is @xmath1 .",
    "i will consider the case of a 1d array , but the basic ideas can easily be generalized to a 2d array .",
    "in addition , i will suppose that all of the receivers are located on the ground ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the receivers in a 1d array are located at different positions in the @xmath22-direction .",
    "the electric field on the ground is @xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the zenith angle of the source .",
    "if the source is at the zenith , the phase of the electric field is the same everywhere on the ground ( figure  [ fig : interferometry ] ) .",
    "however , as the zenith angle increases , it takes radiation longer to reach one side of the array than the other because the path lengths are slightly different . the electric field on the ground at any instant therefore oscillates on the @xmath22-axis , with spatial wavelength @xmath25 ( figure  [ fig : interferometry ] ) .",
    "the spatial fourier transform of this electric field is particularly simple : @xmath26(\\kappa ) = { \\bf e_0 } \\times \\delta\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\lambda } \\right ) = { \\bf e_0 } \\times \\delta\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_x } \\right).\\ ] ] in fourier space , all of the power is concentrated at an inverse wavelength @xmath27 with a simple dependence on @xmath24 . instead of the wavenumber @xmath28 throughout the paper .",
    "this avoids the need to divide by @xmath29 when considering the units , although the equations themselves then do use a factor of @xmath29 . ]",
    "thus , the fourier transform of the field describes the direction the radiation is coming from ( bottom panels of figure  [ fig : interferometry ] ) . since the fourier transform is a linear operator , additional sources sum linearly in the fourier transform of the electric field .",
    "the interferometer can be `` aimed '' at a given direction @xmath30 by adding a time delay @xmath31 to each receiver , adjusting the relative phases of the electric field at each position .",
    "when considering radiation of many different wavelengths , there appears to be an ambiguity in equation  [ eqn : fouriere ] . how can we tell whether a short wavelength mode is a high frequency wave coming from near the horizon or a low frequency wave coming from near the zenith ? this is easily resolved by examining the signal in time domain .",
    "the time frequency of the signal is the same everywhere on the ground plane ; it is merely delayed at some points more than others .",
    "interferometry works because the projection of the wave onto a plane stretches it out in spatial wavelength without changing its time frequency .",
    "each pair of receivers @xmath32 and @xmath33 is separated by a distance @xmath34 ; the separation can also be written in terms of the @xmath5 coordinates : @xmath35 the pair measures a single fourier mode of the electric field with wavelength @xmath36 , which only provides information about the distribution of radiation on the sky on an angular scale of @xmath37 thus , traditional interferometers are insensitive to structures with angular scales greater than @xmath38 or less than @xmath39 .",
    "an important goal of interferometers is to `` fill in '' as much of the @xmath5 plane as possible , and this can be aided by allowing the earth s spin to rotate the sky and by using different frequencies .",
    "the fftt is the simplest interferometer to understand without obscuring the basic principle . in a standard fftt ,",
    "the receivers are arranged on a @xmath8 rectangular grid with separation @xmath40 . by nyquist",
    "s theorem , the electric field everywhere on the grid can be reconstructed with a spatial resolution @xmath41 .",
    "a fast fourier transform can be directly be performed on the electric fields measured at each receiver to produce an electric field image , which is then squared to give the intensity image @xcite .",
    "structures on angular scales ranging from @xmath42 to the whole sky can be mapped this way with the fftt .",
    "the spatial fourier transform works because _ it measures the projection effect _ on the time - domain fourier modes .      of course , it is often impractical to measure the electric field everywhere as a continuous function .",
    "the subtleties in understanding interferometry ( particularly the use of `` visibilities '' ) arise because of the limited sampling of the electric field .",
    "actual interferometers are composed of a series of discrete elements , which could be anything from simple dipole antennas to single dish telescopes .",
    "these receivers each have a primary beam @xmath43 that describes their sensitivity to radiation that comes from different directions @xmath44 on the sky . a large single dish s primary beam is typically confined to a narrow region in the sky with radius @xmath45 for a dish diameter @xmath46 .",
    "dipole antennas have sensitivity over much of the sky , which is why they are proposed for fftts .",
    "the measured electric field ( or intensity ) is the sky intensity convolved with @xmath47 ( or @xmath43 ) .",
    "i assume that the antennas all have the same response , are all pointed in the same direction , and there is only one point source in the sky , so that the antenna response can be approximated as a constant @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 in intensity ) .",
    "the other limitation , mainly faced by traditional interferometers , is that the @xmath5 plane may be sparsely sampled .",
    "interferometers , whether fftts or traditional , are insensitive to the electric fields outside of their collective area .",
    "in addition , sparse interferometers only have a few measurements of the electric field from which to extrapolate the entire @xmath5 plane .",
    "thus , the measured electric fields are filtered by the interferometer s sampling on the ground , @xmath50 : @xmath51 for a polarization @xmath52 .",
    "then the fourier transform of the electric field is the convolution of its fourier modes with the dirty beam @xmath53 $ ] : @xmath54 ( { \\bf \\kappa } ) = \\sqrt{a } { \\cal f } [ e_{\\pi}({\\bf x } ) ] \\ast p^{\\rm dirty}.\\ ] ] the result is the dirty map .",
    "some method is then necessary to deconvolve the dirty map with the dirty beam to get the sky distribution of radiation .    in traditional interferometry ,",
    "these difficulties are dealt with by calculating visibilities for each pair of receivers , @xmath55 averaged over time .",
    "the van cittert - zernike theorem relates the visibilities to the fourier transform of the sky intensity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the dirty map is calculated as @xmath56 \\ast p_{\\rm dirty}.\\ ] ] because of the sparsity of traditional interferometers , their dirty beams may be very complicated .",
    "algorithms like clean @xcite deconvolve the dirty map with the dirty beam .",
    "the fourier transform is actually just one of the family of linear canonical transforms ( lcts ) .",
    "the lcts are the set of all linear integral transforms that conserve volume and orientation in position - frequency space .",
    "they can be represented by the abcd matrix @xmath57 with a determinant of 1 @xcite .",
    "the lct synthesizes a signal at a new position coordinate @xmath58 and a new frequency ( inverse wavelength ) coordinate @xmath59 out of the old position @xmath22 and frequency @xmath27 , as given by @xmath60 there is no unique definition for an lct , but the following is usually used @xcite : @xmath61(x^{\\prime } ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{r } \\displaystyle \\sqrt{\\frac{-i}{b } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } e^{\\pi i ( a x^2 - 2 x x^{\\prime } + d x^{\\prime 2})/b } f(x ) dx \\\\ ( b \\ne 0 ) \\\\",

    "it measures how much of the signal is at each position and frequency @xcite : @xmath62(x,\\kappa ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } f\\left(x + \\frac{u}{2}\\right ) \\overline{f\\left(x - \\frac{u}{2}\\right ) } e^{-2\\pi i \\kappa u } du.\\ ] ] if @xmath63 is a delta function , then its wigner distribution is a vertical line ( taking @xmath22 to be horizontal and @xmath27 as vertical ) .",
    "the function @xmath64 is a horizontal line in wigner space .",
    "diagonal lines in wigner space are linear chirps .    a form of parseval s theorem applies to lcts , @xmath65 as such , an lct can not increase the total `` energy '' in a signal .",
    "what they _ can _ do is carve up wigner space into slices that are aligned with a signal s energy .",
    "this concentrates the energy into a small bin along one direction , making the signal easier to detect .",
    "the lcts are simply the composition of a few basic operations in wigner ( position - frequency ) space @xcite .",
    "the first basic operation is rotation through some angle @xmath66 : @xmath67 rotation mixes the position domain with frequency domain . when @xmath68 , the lct is simply the fourier transform : @xmath69 then the new position coordinate is @xmath27 . for other angles ,",
    "the rotation is a _ fractional fourier transform _",
    "( frfts ) .",
    "frfts use chirps as their orthogonal basis functions .",
    "the second basic operation is shear by some quantity @xmath70 : @xmath71 the shear of position / frequency space is also known as a _",
    "fresnel transform_. the final basic operation is magnification by a factor @xmath72 , or @xmath73    nor are lcts limited to real numbers .",
    "the laplace transform is well known to be the fourier transform of the imaginary frequencies , and is given by : @xmath74 of course , other transforms can be constructed out of these basic operations .",
    "the lcts are deeply connected with optics .",
    "quadratic phase systems can be represented by an @xmath75 matrix that corresponds directly to the @xmath75 matrix of an lct @xcite .",
    "suppose the electric field of a light wave at location 1 is described in terms of a position @xmath76 and spatial frequency @xmath77 .",
    "the light wave is processed by some optical system @xmath78 and reaches location 2 , where the electric field is described in terms of position @xmath79 and spatial frequency @xmath80 .",
    "then the optical system s effects can be represented as @xmath81 for monochromatic light , the spatial frequency directly corresponds to a ray s angle with the optical axis .",
    "@xmath78 is a composition of the @xmath75 matrices of several basic elements .",
    "if a light wave moves a distance @xmath82 through free space , the matrix is a shear matrix @xmath83 this is of course the fresnel transform , named for fresnel diffraction . a thin lens with focal length @xmath84 shears in the frequency axis instead : @xmath85 any lct can be constructed out of these elements @xcite .    with digital optics , there are none of the usual physical limits on what material properties are realistic or not .",
    "one can easily emulate a material with index of refraction that is less than 1 , negative , or even complex .",
    "digital optics that mimic negative index of refraction materials can effectively act as superlenses , useful for near - field imaging of sources closer than one wavelength ( see section  [ sec : evanescence ] ) .",
    "as is well known , a lens performs the fourier transform of the electric field .",
    "we can confirm this with the @xmath75 formalism .",
    "consider a lens with focal length @xmath84 .",
    "it focuses light from infinity into an image on a plane a distance @xmath84 after the lens .",

    "that is , we perform a `` magnification '' by a factor @xmath88 on the input plane to get a unitless coordinate system , perform a fourier transform , and then perform a `` magnification '' by a factor @xmath87 on the output to get it back into physical units .",
    "fractional fourier transforms lie in between the standard first - order fourier transform and a zeroth - order fourier transform  the identity transform .",
    "one can think of the identity and fourier transforms as two limiting extremes .",
    "if the source is so close that it lies within the array , it has a position but no single direction in the sky .",
    "the identity transform on the electric field is then most useful . if the source is at infinity , it lies in a definite direction , but it has no `` position '' within the array .",
    "then the first - order fourier transform of the electric field is necessary to recover its direction .",
    "this thought experiment suggests that if a source is at intermediate distance , its position and direction are both moderately defined , and one would use some intermediate fractional - order fourier transform to find it .",
    "this turns out to be the case .",
    "if the source is merely very distant but not at infinity , the source displays parallax between different parts of the interferometer ( figure  [ fig : frftgeometry ] ) .",
    "because of parallax , the radiation _ can not _ be effectively described as coming from a single direction , even if the source is localized ( figure  [ fig : fractionalinterferometry ] ) .",

    "the overall effect of a nim is to effectively undo the propagation of light @xcite .",

    "they vanish in the far - field ( @xmath209 ) , but if they enter a nim before that , they are amplified back up to their original strength or beyond .",
    "thus , it is possible to reconstruct the electric field at the source in precise detail with a nim .",
    "this superlens effect allows an optical system to capture information below the diffraction limit in the near - field limit @xcite .",
    "physical microwave superlenses have been built out of metamaterials , but there are fundamental limits to their performance that do not apply to digital optics .",
    "the most important is causality .",
    "a wavefront can not bend away from the surface normal instantaneously ; the far side of the wavefront needs time to catch up to the near side .",
    "light in a nim has a superluminal phase velocity , but the group velocity is necessarily less than @xmath210 , and there is a delay time before the wavefronts are launched @xcite .",
    "the constraint of causality necessarily introduces dispersion , however , so a physical superlens is limited to a narrow wavelength range @xcite .    but a digital system is not limited by causality . when a digital optical system is synthesized and applied to stored data , the entire history of the electric field is already known , so an acausal system is possible",
    ". causality is respected in a fundamental sense , because it already takes a light - crossing time for the information to be received by a central processor .",
    "as such , a digital superlens may be designed to have no dispersion and can work at any frequency . however , the resolution of a digital superlens is still limited by the sampling of the electric field @xcite .",
    "digital superlenses are practical in the near - field regime , when the source is less than one wavelength away .",
    "while this does not apply for astronomical sources , it does apply to atmospheric radio phenomena at very low frequencies .",
    "astronomical sources are , of course , so far away that evanescent waves have long since decayed away . trying to amplify these vanished waves instead merely amplifies random noise .",
    "the one proposal to use nims in astronomical telescopes involves artificially creating evanescent waves in a nim that simulate the evanescent waves that exist in the near - field of a source , which usually requires some knowledge of what the source looks like @xcite .",
    "an interferometer with a digital superlens is really a _ microscope _ rather than a telescope .",
    "if digital superlenses use evanescent waves to reconstruct sub - diffraction images of near - field objects , it is natural to wonder if the evanescent waves can be detected directly .",
    "the evanescent waves are exponentially damped with distance from the source .",
    "the array measures a slice of these fields , which generically has an exponential dependence on position due to projection ( figure  [ fig : laplacianinterferometry ] ) .",

    "can we build a _",
    "interferometer around this principle , instead of the usual fourier interferometer ?",
    "there are two types of laplace transform that we can consider .",

    "the spike is laplace transformed into an exponential in @xmath111-space , @xmath216 . ideally , we would just invert the measured electric field back into a delta function in @xmath27-space .",
    "yet the inversion fails because the inverse bilateral laplace integral diverges .",
    "bilateral laplace transforms generally have limited domains of convergence in @xmath217 .",
    "the one - sided laplace transform , @xmath218 = \\int_0^{\\infty } e^{-s \\kappa } f(\\kappa ) dk\\ ] ] has better convergence properties .",
    "once again , the laplace transform of @xmath215 is an exponential in @xmath111-space , @xmath219 , as long as @xmath220 .",
    "an exponential can be inverse laplace transformed back into a @xmath108-function .",
    "conceivably , all we need to do to build an evanescent wave interferometer is perform a one - sided inverse laplace transform on the measured electric field .",
    "this is the infamous problem of separating exponentials that crops up from time to time in various fields @xcite .",
    "the underlying obstacle is that that the inversion requires integration in the complex @xmath111 domain : @xmath221 = \\lim_{c \\to \\infty } \\int_{\\gamma - ic}^{\\gamma + ic } e^{s \\kappa } f(s ) ds.\\ ] ] the contour of integration is the bromwich contour , for which @xmath222 has a greater real value than all singularities of @xmath223 . while this is fine if we know the behavior of @xmath223 at complex @xmath111 ( as we do for the analytic exponential function ) , an array can measure the electric field only at real - valued positions .",
    "because of the importance of the problem , several numerical algorithms have been developed that attempt to fit exponential(s ) to data at real - valued positions @xcite .",
    "for example , one might fit the data with an analytic function ( such as laguerre or chebyshev polynomials ) and then extrapolate it into the complex domain @xcite .",
    "the exponentials can also be fit by transforming the variables and performing a certain deconvolution @xcite .",
    "all techniques suffer from extreme instabilities in the presence of noise , because the separation of exponentials is `` ill - posed '' with several solutions @xcite . in functional analysis terms , the exponential functions are far from orthogonal @xcite .",
    "since exponentials vary rapidly , even a slight fluctuation requires huge changes in the spectrum in order for the exponentials to cancel out in most places .",
    "even the number of exponentials that produce the signal can be impossible to extract @xcite .    the inability to infer which exponentials contribute to the electric field is fundamentally related to the diffraction limit in optics @xcite , and why we can not detect evanescent waves from astronomical sources .",
    "an image of an object is formed by an optical system with some entrance pupil .",
    "the image is a fourier transform of the electric field near the pupil ; therefore , the finite size of the pupil filters out high spatial frequency information .",
    "but the fourier transform necessarily produces an analytic function , so all of the information can hypothetically be reconstructed from the small sliver that passes the pupil @xcite . the apparently infinite resolution compared to the limited resolution of actual optics",
    "presents an apparent paradox @xcite .",
    "the paradox is solved by noting that although the high frequency information is still mathematically present , it is suppressed to nearly zero amplitude . in more formal terms , the eigenvalues of the optical system s eigenfunctions drop from almost exactly one to almost exactly zero as one passes the diffraction bound @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "attempting to find the strengths of the high frequency information results in a division by ( nearly ) zero , and even the slightest noise results in wild deviations .",
    "the problem is a generic one for integral equations , including the laplace transform , which smooths the exponential spectrum on small scales @xcite .",
    "physically , the suppression of the high eigenfunctions comes from the decay of evanescent waves decay after propagating any significant length . in order to measure those waves",
    ", they have to be multiplied back up by an exponential factor to their original strength  or , equivalently , their amplitudes must be divided by nearly zero .",
    "the inevitable noise within the system is also amplified with the evanescent waves , scrambling any information they contain .",
    "even if we had a perfect detector , quantum fluctuations inject unavoidable noise , limiting the resolution in the far - field @xcite .",
    "likewise , the throughput of the optical system is very small for evanescent waves , and any detectable signal requires a vast number of photons with a vast amount of energy @xcite . or , reversing time , an antenna can broadcast radiation in an arbitrarily narrow angle only at the cost of vast input power @xcite .    for astronomical objects , with distances of @xmath224 ,",
    "the evanescent waves are suppressed by a factor @xmath225 .",
    "hence , we can not use superlenses to image astronomical objects with arbitrary resolution . only in the near - field ,",
    "where the exponential functions are well - behaved and the evanescent waves have not yet decayed , can the laplace transform be inverted .",
    "the virtual impossibility of a laplacian interferometer makes the connection between the two problems explicit .",
    "just as non - fourier transforms can be used for the spatial structure of the electric field , the temporal structure of the field can be decomposed using other transforms . of course",
    ", there is nothing inherently wrong with using the fourier transform , as any function can be stably represented as a sum of fourier modes .",
    "the fourier transform is not as natural , though , for representing signals whose frequency changes rapidly in time ( as noted in @xcite ) .",
    "suppose the radiation from a source is isotropic .",
    "we denote the electric field at a distance @xmath226 ( see figure  [ fig : frftgeometry ] ) and a time @xmath19 as @xmath227 . because the radiation is isotropic , @xmath228 where @xmath229 can be any function with finite energy .",
    "now we wish to understand how the @xmath84 waveform varies across the array .",
    "let @xmath230 .",
    "then , @xmath231\\ ] ] using the same logic as we used to derive the fractional interferometer in section  [ sec : fracinterferometer ] .",
    "the principles of a generic waveform interferometer are essentially the same as those for a regular fourier interferometer ( section  [ sec : interferometryintro ] ) .",
    "the array on the ground measures a horizontal slice out of the electric field .",
    "the measured waveform at a given time is some kind of projection of the waveform in time .",
    "if the source is infinitely far away , the projection simply stretches out the waveform depending on its altitude .",
    "the waveform is stretched out more for a source at high altitude ( equation  [ eqn : tgenericinterferometer ] ) than for a source on the horizon ( see section  [ sec : interferometryintro ] and figure  [ fig : genericinterferometry ] ) . by measuring the amount the waveform is stretched out on the ground , one can reconstruct where on the sky the source is .",
    "when the source is not at infinity , the generic waveform interferometer is analogous to the fractional fourier interferometer ( section  [ sec : fracinterferometer ] ) .",
    "the source s position on the sky has a measurable parallax from one end of the array to the other .",
    "thus , the stretch of the waveform on the ground varies from one position to another because of the quadratic dependence of the delay time on position ( equation  [ eqn : tgenericinterferometer ] ) . on the side of the interferometer closer to the source ,",
    "the waveform is stretched more than on the far side .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : genericinterferometry ] ( right panel ) . by measuring the chirping of the waveform ,",
    "one gets information on its distance .    as with the usual fourier interferometer , the time dependence of the electric field signal allows one to distinguish whether its shape at a given moment is due to the radiation s temporal variation or is some kind of geometrical effect .",
    "we can see from equation  [ eqn : tgenericinterferometer ] that the geometry of the array merely shifts the delay time with position .",
    "otherwise , the time structure of the signal is not changed .",
    "we have greater freedom in interpreting the time structure of a radio signal than generally appreciated .",
    "what is so special about the fourier transform ?",
    "i believe the ubiquity of the fourier transform arises from four reasons .",
    "the first is that the fourier transform is well studied , with plenty of `` fast '' algorithms existing .",
    "there are widely available free packages that are tuned to compute the fft quickly .",
    "yet fast algorithms exist for other transforms .",
    "fast algorithms now exist for all lcts , if not quite as sophisticated as for fourier transforms .",
    "additionally , the discrete wavelet transform has been known for more than 20 years .",
    "second , complex fourier modes are defined as exponentials , which are eigenfunctions of standard derivatives and integrals .",
    "this simplifies the analysis with standard calculus , as opposed to wavelets for example .",
    "yet there is no reason , in principle , why we could not use a calculus based on different operations .",
    "third , the fourier modes are solutions to the wave equations as encountered in physics , like maxwell s equations .",
    "dispersion , and the effective velocity of the signal , depends on pure frequency only .",
    "dispersive effects are particularly important for radio waves passing through interstellar plasma . a mode with several fourier frequencies disperses . by using the fourier transform ,",
    "one can account for the effects of dispersion simply .",
    "this is less of an issue at high frequencies .",
    "finally , and i believe most important , the astronomical sources currently being studied are _ slowly varying _  at least compared to one cycle of a radio wave .",
    "radio sources have well - defined spectra that can be integrated over time .",
    "specifically , the power spectral density of radio signals from typical astronomical sources does not rapidly change in the fourier domain . as the fourier transform is natural for long - lived sources ,",
    "there has generally not been a need for another basis .",
    "but as the study of transient sources becomes more prevalent , there will be greater need for waveforms that are well - localized in time ( as in figure  [ fig : genericinterferometry ] ) .",
    "although the fourier basis can be used for short pulses , the time structure of the pulse is `` hidden '' in the phase information .",
    "the fourier basis power spectral density of a pulse is constant at all frequencies , the same as for generic white noise .",
    "in fact , the anita instrument for measuring radio pulses from ultra - high energy neutrinos already employs a kind of `` pulse interferometry '' for this reason @xcite .",
    "a possible testing ground for generalized interferometers are frbs .",
    "frbs are essentially chirps that last for a few milliseconds at each frequency ; they appear as thin curves in `` waterfall '' plots of the usual time - frequency domain @xcite . assuming an astronomical origin , the different arrival times of the frbs at different frequencies is caused by dispersion in plasma , parameterized by the dispersion measure ( dm ) : @xmath232^{-1}\\ ] ] bannister et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xcite noted that the delay time has a linear approximation because of taylor s theorem : @xmath233    as i discussed in section  [ sec : fracinterferometer ] , linear chirps are separable with a frft of the correct order .",
    "we must put the chirp variable in dimensionless terms to use the frft in equation  [ eqn : frft ] .",
    "this can be done by using any reference frequency @xmath234 as the unit for the frequency and @xmath235 as the unit for time ; then the chirping is @xmath236 . for a burst that is smeared out by plasma dispersion , and using the linear approximation ( equation  [ eqn : lineardispersion ] ) ,",
    "the `` angle '' of the frft we want is @xmath237 for a very small dm , @xmath238 because the pulse is basically the same at all frequencies .",
    "then we want to examine the signal essentially in time domain , where it appears as an undispersed pulse . for a very large dm , @xmath239 because the pulse appears to be a nearly pure tone , which very slowly slides in frequencies over time",
    ". then we want to examine the signal essentially in frequency domain , because the pulse is smeared out to a narrowband tone .",
    "the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath240 in equation  [ eqn : alphafrb ] seems extremely small , but it is in fact measurable .",
    "as with the fractional interferometer ( section  [ sec : fracinterferometerlimits ] ) , the difference @xmath241 and @xmath242 becomes measurable when the phase difference between a pure tone and the chirp is @xmath243 radian .",
    "the signal must be sampled for a time @xmath244 : @xmath245 since radio surveys last much longer than a few microseconds , a frft is actually quite useful .",
    "the problem of searching for chirps in signals for a sparse array has been considered before by bannister et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xcite .",
    "their algorithm for finding chirps involves multiplying the complex voltages at one element with the complex conjugate voltage at a second element .",
    "since the chirp at one element is just a time - delayed copy of the chirp at another element , the product can be shown to be a pure tone .",
    "a fourier transform of the product finds the frequency of the tone , giving information on the chirp .",
    "they call this method the `` chirpolator '' , and note that it is the maximum likelihood estimator for chirps as found in @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , this operation turns out to be the frft in disguise .",
    "the kernel of a frft with @xmath66 given by equation  [ eqn : alphafrb ] is ( c.f . , equation  [ eqn : frft ] ) @xmath246,\\ ] ] using the @xmath234 to take care of units .",
    "in this case @xmath247 has the units of time , and we can in fact interpret it as a time delay .",
    "thus , the kernel of the frft becomes @xmath248 \\\\",
    "\\times \\exp[2 \\pi",
    "i \\nu_0 ^ 2(\\cot \\alpha - \\csc \\alpha )",
    "t \\delta t].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] given a chirp with frequency derivative @xmath249 , the frft multiplies it by a conjugated , time - delayed copy of itself , and then takes a fourier transform of the result .",
    "this is precisely what the chirpolator does , up to a multiplicative constant @xcite .",
    "a similar algorithm by bannister et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is the chimageator , which involves taking the spatial fourier transform of the voltage product .",
    "the chirpolator and the frft formulations have different strengths . with the chirpolator ,",
    "it is not necessary to know the frequency slide @xmath249 beforehand to get a reasonable estimate of the chirp properties .",
    "one can apply the kernel in equation  [ eqn : kernelchirpolator ] without knowing what @xmath66 is , up to a frequency shift .",
    "in addition , the antennas do not have to be in a rectangular grid to apply the chirpolator .",
    "the frft s first advantage is that it is conceptually simpler  just a rotation in wigner space ( figure  [ fig : frftgeometry ] ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the complexity of a fast frft only goes as @xmath250 for @xmath6 elements , whereas the chirpolator s complexity goes as @xmath251 .",
    "one might consider combining these methods advantages by using the chirpolator with a few elements to get a decent estimate of @xmath66 , and then using the frft on all of the complex voltages in the array to extract a precise characterization of a chirp with all of the data .",
    "all of the tools of functional analysis can generalize interferometry fully , as they have done for signal processing .",
    "the electromagnetic field is a complex function of position .",
    "formally , we need four real numbers to describe it , one for each stokes parameter . but for simplicity , just consider a single scalar , the electric field intensity at a given point as a function of time , @xmath253 .",
    "( @xmath253 can also stand for any other wave , including sound . )",
    "any realistic signal lasts only a finite time and contains a finite amount of energy : @xmath254 but otherwise , @xmath255 may in principle be any square - integrable function .",
    "@xmath256 is therefore an element of the hilbert space @xmath252 , which represents all square - integrable functions .",
    "is perhaps most familiar as the space of all quantum wavefunctions .",
    "] it has an inner product defined by @xmath257 we can define various orthonormal bases for @xmath252 from orthogonal functions with @xmath258 .",
    "the vector of @xmath256 in @xmath252 in any basis is given by its projection onto each basis vector using the inner product .",
    "the important part is that we can change between bases .",
    "the standard basis for @xmath256 is the dirac position basis , with orthonormal vectors representing each @xmath259 . in this basis , the components of @xmath256 are just given by its value at each position , as can be seen by plugging @xmath259 into equation  [ eqn : innerproduct ] .",
    "we can say a trivial interferometer merely gives @xmath256 .",
    "the fourier basis is also common , with basis vectors of @xmath260 .",
    "the fourier basis components of @xmath256 in @xmath252 is just the fourier transform of the function .",
    "a normal fourier interferometer resolves @xmath256 into this basis , inferring where radiation is coming from .",
    "these do not exhaust the possibilities .",
    "all lcts on @xmath256  including the frft , laplace transform , and fresnel transform  perform a basis change on @xmath252 , where the basis vectors are the integral kernel .",
    "a major theme of this paper has been to explore when these other bases are appropriate .",
    "the lcts are just the beginning",
    ". other sets of orthogonal functions include polynomials , bessel functions , wavelets @xcite , and chirplets . in the most general sense , an interferometer projects @xmath256 into any @xmath252 basis .",
    "the only question is whether the bases have any useful meaning , and whether the transform is stable both forwards and in reverse ( it is not in general ; @xcite ) .",
    "an interferometer array measures a cross section of the electric field along a line or plane .",
    "if the source radiates isotropically , then the different antenna locations detect the same signal but sample it with different time delays .",
    "the radiation from a source at infinity arrives as planar wavefronts with no curvature , in which case the time delay is exactly proportional to position .",
    "if the source is closer , the time delay is roughly a second - order function of position .",
    "thus , the signal measured by the array at a given instant should be a stretched or chirped version of the signal in time .",
    "an interferometer decomposes @xmath253 into a set of basis functions , and then finds the inner product of these basis functions and the signal measured in space to determine the direction and distance of the source .",
    "we use fourier interferometers because the fourier basis is the natural one for the time structure of the electric field , which in turn is due to the steadiness of typically - studied astronomical sources ( section  [ sec : timedomain ] ) .",
    "the electric signals from a distant source have a simple representation in this basis , making it convenient for calculation .",
    "it is analogous to reference frames in cosmology : there is only one reference frame in which the cosmic expansion is isotropic at any point , so we usually do calculations in this frame .",
    "but the laws of physics are the same in all reference frames , and nothing stops us from working in any frame we wish . likewise , although fourier interferometers are computationally useful , nothing stops us from doing interferometry in any other basis of @xmath252 .",
    "i have focused on linear transformations of the @xmath256 signal , but nonlinear transformations are also possible . for a monochromatic input wave , a nonlinear interferometer produces a warped output image .",
    "this allows us to distort the wigner space distribution of a signal in arbitrary ways .",
    "this might be used to fit signals with quadratic dependence of frequency on position ( cubic dependence of phase on position ) , including those from sources that are very nearby .",
    "likewise , one could also warp the time - frequency basis of a signal to fit quadratic chirps . the main obstacle nonlinear interferometer , though , is the computational cost of calculating a relevant nonlinear transformation .",
    "quantum optics is an increasingly important field .",
    "photon arrival times is already an integral part of intensity interferometry of thermal sources @xcite .",
    "quantum non - demolition measurements may also prove useful in detecting structures below the diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "just as classical optics can be emulated with a standard digital computer , it may be possible to emulate arbitrary quantum optical systems with a quantum computer .",
    "the catch is that when the quantum computer produces an answer , the wavefunction collapses or decoheres .",
    "since a quantum state can not be exactly copied , it is lost forever to us and can not be recovered .",
    "thus , while we can run a classically recorded signal through any number of simulated classical optical systems simultaneously , we can simulate at most one quantum optical system .",
    "the fundamental limitation is that we can not determine which detector a photon passes through .",
    "equivalently , the phase of a single photon can not be measured @xcite .      to end on an extremely speculative note , an expanded consideration of the possible basis functions of a signal may have implications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) @xcite .",
    "so far , the most common assumption has been that a deliberate message would appear as an extremely narrowband signal @xcite .",
    "frequency combs are another possibility @xcite , as are very short pulses @xcite .",
    "messerschmitt @xcite argued that discrete points within blocks of time - frequency space could encode messages with optimal energy efficiency .",
    "the fourier basis seems natural to us , so we naturally think of tones and pulses .",
    "but with seti we have to extrapolate to entities with potentially very different psychologies and mathematics far beyond our comprehension .",
    "for example , the exponential functions that make up the fourier basis functions are the eigenfunctions of the standard differentiation and integration operations . but are these the only possible operators that an eti may base their calculus around ?",
    "if an eti has studied quantum mechanics for a long time , one could imagine that the wavefunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator may seem a more natural basis set . or consider that wavelets were essentially unknown to the physics community @xcite when modern radio seti was first proposed @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]    in time - frequency space , basis functions that seem `` obvious '' to a long - lived eti may appear very complicated to us if they are not using the fourier transform ( figure  [ fig : setiwigner ] ) .",
    "a more general way to look for eti signals is to search for strong signals that contain both fine - grained ( or `` thin '' ) features and big , smooth regions in time - frequency space .",
    "narrowband signals , combs , pulses , and sets of discrete points , are just a few examples of such signals . leaving behind smooth 1d curves",
    ", we could imagine a signal that looks like a 2d pattern in time - frequency space , such as a sierpinski triangle .",
    "known natural phenomena generally produce signals that are smeared out , with no fine - grained features , while white noise appears uncorrelated in all bases , with no big , smooth regions .",
    "even then , if an eti uses some nonlinear ( disconnected , even ) mixture of time and frequency , the signals may just appear as blobs in time - frequency space . wavelets , after all , use a three - dimensional signal representation @xcite .",
    "in addition , looking for mixed fine - grained and smooth features in time - frequency space may be a strategy biased towards finding patterns that human perception emphasizes ( such as edges in the visual field ) , which are contingent on human evolution .",
    "of course , it becomes impractical to search for _ all _ possible signals , unless they are distinguished by some other way , like being extraordinarily bright signals from a solar - type star . most of the possible signals look simply like white noise .",
    "we may be guided by the assumption that the etis resources are limited .",
    "the lcts and other transforms like the wavelet transform are advantageous in that they can be performed in only linear computational time . in contrast , a typical linear transformation is a matrix multiplication that requires at least quadratic computational time .",
    "but ultimately , we may just have to follow the example of bell burnell in discovering pulsars @xcite , and examine time - frequency space ( or any other obvious representation that occurs to us ) closely for anything out of the ordinary ( c.f .",
    "there is nothing inherently special about the fourier basis that requires its use for interferometry . in time domain",
    ", the signal can be decomposed into any set of basis functions .",
    "basis functions that are more wideband but localized in time may be more useful when characterizing very short transients .",
    "the position dependence of the electric field measured by a planar array is related to the signal in time domain for an isotropic source , which is stretched out due to projection effects if the source is away from the zenith , and is chirped if the source is nearby .",
    "the fourier modes are natural mainly because astrophysical sources vary slowly in time .",
    "digital interferometers simulate optical systems .",
    "the standard fourier transform performed by interferometers focuses light coming from infinity .",
    "i have described in this paper fractional interferometers , which use the fractional fourier transform .",
    "these focus light from sources that are closer than infinity .",
    "i have demonstrated that there are many sources that are in the regime where a fractional interferometer is useful , including atmospheric radio transients , artificial satellites , and vlbi observations of objects within the solar system .",
    "the frft with orders very close to 1 can be implemented by combining the standard fourier transform and chirp multiplications .",
    "i have shown that the fractional interferometer is analogous to the chirpolator @xcite .",
    "other linear canonical transforms simulate different optical elements .    since interferometers these days record signals digitally , it is possible to simulate optics that are not physically possible .",
    "i considered the possibility of digitally emulating negative refractive index superlenses .",
    "these would be useful for constructing images of sources that are within one wavelength of the array , which may be useful at very low frequencies .",
    "these techniques can not be applied to sources that are astronomically distant , because noise overwhelms any remaining signal from evanescent waves .",
    "this is related to the impracticality of using the laplace transform as a basis for interferometers  the separation of exponentials is generally an ill - posed problem @xcite .    my discussion in this paper has been general and qualitative .",
    "there are many practicalities that need to be considered in practice .",
    "most importantly , it is important to extend the results to the sparse arrays typical of interferometers , instead of the dense arrays used in fftts .",
