    "this symmetry must be broken either explicitly by some dimensional mass parameters in the theory or implicitly by quantum loop effects , _  la _ coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite , for example .",
    "indeed , scale invariance is manifestly broken in the lagrangian of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics at tree level by just a single negative mass squared term in the higgs potential . despite the lack of scale invariance in the standard model , it is logically plausible to imagine that there exists such a scale invariant sector at a higher scale above tev that can be probed at the lhc or ilc . such a sector",
    "might be strongly coupled to itself and highly nontrivial but nevertheless can be only weakly coupled to the matter in the standard model .",
    "one expects that such a sector decouples effectively from the low energy and can use the power of effective field theory approach to describe its low energy effects .",
    "recently , georgi @xcite motivated by the banks - zaks theory @xcite , suggested that a scale invariant sector with a nontrivial infrared fixed - point behaves rather peculiar from the perspective of particle physics .",
    "it was keenly observed in @xcite that an operator @xmath6 with a general non - integral scale dimension @xmath7 in a scale invariant sector has a mass spectrum looked like a @xmath8 number of invisible massless particles .",
    "this was coined as unparticle @xmath9 by georgi .",
    "unparticle does not have a fixed invariant mass squared but instead a continuous mass spectrum in accordance with the above general argument .",
    "it was also pointed out that real production of an unparticle at low energy processes described by an effective field theory can give rise to peculiar missing energy distributions because of the possible non - integral values of @xmath7 .",
    "subsequently , the propagator for the unparticle was worked out independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an unusual phase in the unparticle propagator was discovered by both groups and the interesting interference patterns between the amplitude of @xmath4-channel unparticle exchange and those from the sm were studied . in ref .",

    "in addition , four - fermion contact interactions due to spin-1 and 2 unparticle exchanges are written down . at the end of this section , we also speculate on a possible connection between unparticle physics and theories of large extra dimension .",

    "to fix notation we denote the scale invariant sector as a banks - zaks ( @xmath21 ) sector @xcite and follow closely the scenario studied in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 sector can interact with the standard model fields through the exchange of a connector sector that has a high mass scale @xmath22 . below this high mass scale ,",

    "these unparticle operators can even carry standard model quantum numbers @xcite , for example a charged unparticle can be anticipated . throughout this work we are contented with the unparticle operators that are standard model singlets .",

    "based on the similar scale dependence , the unparticle spectral density is identified with the phase space of @xmath8-body massless particle in a convention advocated in @xcite : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "we have studied a number of processes that involve emission of the unparticle in the final state , including @xmath360 at the ilc and @xmath17 at the @xmath0-pole , as well as the monojet production at the lhc .",
    "we found that the energy distribution of the single photon or the single @xmath0 at ilc and the missing energy distribution in @xmath361 can discriminate the scale dimension @xmath7 .",
    "however , the monojet energy spectrum is not so sensitive to @xmath7 because of the wash - out by parton smearing .",
    "we also formulate the virtual exchange of unparticles between sm particles .",
    "we have shown that spin-1 unparticle exchange between two fermions gives rise to contact 4-fermion interactions , which scale as @xmath362 and thus differ from the conventional one because of the peculiar scale dimension @xmath7 .",
    "spin-2 unparticle exchange gives rise to another form of 4-fermion interactions .",
    "we have used drell - yan production at hadronic colliders and fermion - pair production at @xmath145 colliders to study the interference of the unparticle - exchange amplitudes with the sm amplitudes .",
    "one peculiar feature of unparticle propagator is the phase factor @xmath363 which may interfere nontrivially with the @xmath0 boson propagator .",
    "we have demonstrated the intriguing interference effects in great details in fermion - pair production in @xmath145 collisions . finally , we have also studied diphoton production , which also shows the peculiar feature of the phase of unparticle propagator .",
    "unparticles can be conjectured as a generalization of extra dimensions .",
    "the number of extra dimensions only take on integral values while the scale dimension of unparticle can take on any , even non - integral values .",
    "we speculate on a relation @xmath364 that relates the scale dimension to the number of large extra dimension .",
    "therefore , unparticle physics is another program just as important as extra dimensions in the goals of the lhc .",
    "before we end , we offer a number of comments as follows .    1 .",
    "the calculation of diphoton production can be easily extended to other diboson production , such as @xmath365 and @xmath366 , at @xmath145 and hadronic machines .",
    "likewise , one can study the unparticle effect in the gauge boson scattering @xcite .",
    "the peculiar phase factor in the unparticle propagator can be used as a strong phase that is required in the cp violation studies @xcite of the @xmath367-meson system .",
    "it is more natural to assume that the unparticle sector is flavor blind .",
    "flavor changing coupling of the sm particles with the unparticle can then be induced at 1-loop via @xmath143-boson exchange as was done in the second paper in @xcite .",
    "direct flavor changing couplings of the sm fermions with unparticle will suffer strong constraints from low - energy flavor changing processes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these constraints would push unparticle physics out of reach at the lhc .",
    "dijet production at hadronic colliders is also sensitive to unparticle exchange . it would be similar to diphoton production .",
    "one would expect enhancement of cross section at high invariant mass of the dijet .",
    "5 .   our formulas for 4-fermion contact interactions",
    "can be applied to other areas , e.g. , the @xmath144 deep inelastic scattering @xcite , low - energy parity violating experiments , @xmath368 or @xmath369 mixings @xcite , and atomic parity violation experiments @xcite . 6 .",
    "quarkonium decays can also constrain the unparticle by their invisible widths and by the decay mode of @xmath370 nothing .",
    "astrophysics places constraints on real emission of unparticles . in principle ,",
    "emission of unparticles in supernova , neutron stars , or some other astrophysical systems can lead to substantial cooling other than that by neutrinos .",
    "therefore , using the experimentally measured cooling rates one can constrain the unparticle scale . various limits of the unparticle scale",
    "have been estimated in @xcite from the supernova sn 1987a data as well as from other cosmological considerations .",
    "the spin-1 unparticle contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment at 1-loop has been calculated @xcite",
    ". it should be possible to extend the calculation to the spin-2 case as well .",
    "the effect is expected to be minuscule , however .",
    "9 .   besides the 2-point function",
    ", the momentum part of a 3-point or in general @xmath53-point function is known for a conformal field theory in 4 dimension up to an overall constant .",
    "can one determine the overall constant for the 3-point or in general @xmath53-point function for the unparticle operators ?",
    "we will leave this to those with more ambitious minds .",
    "phenomenology of unparticle physics is quite rich .",
    "while the underlying theory of unparticle is still needed to be unraveled by theorists , experimentalists could detect such a hidden scale invariant sector when the behemoth lhc machine becomes online in the year 2008 !",
