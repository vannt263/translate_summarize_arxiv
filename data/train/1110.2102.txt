    "the theory of dissipativity for linear dynamical systems helps in the analysis and design of control systems for several control problems , for example , lqr / lqg control , @xmath0 , synthesis of passive systems , and optimal estimation problems .",
    "when dealing with lti systems , it is straightforward to define dissipativity for controllable systems due to a certain property of such systems that their compactly supported system trajectories are , loosely speaking , ` dense ' in the set of all allowed trajectories .",
    "however , this is not the case for uncontrollable systems , and this situation is the central focus of this paper .",
    "we elaborate more on this point when we define dissipativity and review equivalent conditions for controllable systems in section [ sec2 ] .    in this paper , we use a less - often - used definition of dissipativity for systems , possibly uncontrollable , and generalize key results using some techniques from indefinite linear algebra ( see @xcite ) for solving algebraic riccati inequalities in the context of an uncontrollable state space system .",
    "like in @xcite , we define a system as dissipative if there exists a storage function that satisfies the dissipation inequality for all system trajectories .",
    "the existential aspect of this definition raises key issues that this paper deals with .",
    "the main result we show is that if the uncontrollable poles of an lti system are such that no two of them add to zero , and if the controllable subsystem strictly dissipates energy at frequency equal to infinity , then the dissipativity of the controllable subsystem is equivalent to the system s dissipativity .",
    "we also show that , using the concatenability axiom of the state , the energy stored in a system is a static function of the state variables .",
    "further , we also show that this state is ` observable ' from the external variables , i.e. the state is a linear combination of the external variables and possibly their derivatives .",
    "this is intuitively expected in view of the fact that energy exchange between the system and its ambience takes place through the external variables .",
    "however , it appears that this may not be the case for lossless systems , i.e. systems that do nt dissipate any energy , nor contain a source within .",
    "in this section we include various definitions about the behavioral framework for studying dynamical systems ( subsection [ subsec2.1 ] ) and then introduce background results about dissipative systems ( subsection [ subsec2.2 ] ) .",

    "this kind of image representation is known as an _ observable _ image representation . in this paper ,",

    "we have @xmath511 the above two equations imply @xmath512 for all @xmath513 . since @xmath514 , the behavior @xmath26 is dissipative with respect to both @xmath72 and @xmath462 .",
    "dissipativity with respect to @xmath72 implies @xmath515 .",
    "similarly , dissipativity with respect to @xmath462 implies @xmath516 .",

    "this completes the proof .    as one of the consequences of the above theorem , if the input cardinality condition is satisfied for an uncontrollable behavior , i.e. @xmath519 or @xmath520 , then such a behavior can not be embedded into both a @xmath150-dissipative controllable behavior and a @xmath521-dissipative controllable behavior .",
    "however , an observable storage function for such a situation exists when the controllable part is strictly dissipative at @xmath522 and when the uncontrollable modes satisfy the unmixing condition ( see [ main ] and @xcite for this situation in presence of more assumptions ) , a situation when @xmath519 is very familiar : we deal with rlc circuits in the next section .",
    "we use this method of defining orthogonality of two behaviors to explore further the definition of dissipativity of a behavior . here",
    "we bring out a fundamental significance of the so - called input - cardinality condition : the condition that the number of inputs to the system is equal to the positive signature of the matrix that induces the power supply .",
    "we show that when this condition is not satisfied , then a behavior could be both supplying and absorbing net power , and is still not lossless .",
    "in this brief section we revisit a classical result : a rational transfer function matrix being positive real is a necessary and sufficient condition for that transfer matrix to be realizable using only resistors , capacitors and inductors ( see @xcite and also @xcite for the case with transformers ) .",
    "note that the transfer matrix captures only the controllable part of the behavior and positive realness of the transfer matrix is nothing but dissipativity with respect to the supply rate @xmath523 .",
    "this is made precise below .",
    "consider an @xmath158-port electrical network ( with each port having two terminals ) and the variable @xmath524 , where @xmath287 is the vector of voltages across the @xmath158-ports and @xmath525 is the vector of currents through these ports , with the convention that @xmath523 is the power flowing _ into _ the network .",
    "behaviors that are dissipative with respect to the supply rate @xmath523 are also called ` passive ' . given a controllable behavior @xmath26 whose transfer matrix @xmath526 with respect to a specific input / output partition , say current @xmath525 is the input and voltage @xmath287 is the output , is positive real , one can check that this behavior is passive .",
    "@xmath526 in this case is the impedance matrix and is square , i.e. the number of inputs is equal to the number of outputs .",
    "one can introduce additional laws that the variables need to satisfy , thus resulting in a sub - behavior @xmath527 which has a lesser number of inputs ; consider for example these additional laws as putting certain currents equal to zero : due to opening of certain ports .",
    "however , the transfer matrix for @xmath528 with respect to the input / output partition : input as currents through the non - open ports and output as the voltages across _ all _ the ports , is clearly not square , and in fact , tall , i.e. has strictly more rows than columns .",
    "let @xmath529 denote this transfer function .",
    "since @xmath530 , the behavior @xmath528 is also passive .",
    "of course , @xmath528 need not be controllable , even if @xmath26 is assumed to be controllable . as an extreme case ,",
    "suppose all the currents are equal to zero , and we obtain an autonomous @xmath528 .",
    "while rlc realization of such transfer matrices which are tall , and further of autonomous behaviors obtained by , for example , opening all ports , has received hardly any attention , we remark here one very well - studied sub - behavior of every passive behavior : the zero behavior .",
    "consider the single port network with @xmath531 and @xmath532 .",
    "this port which is called a nullator ( also nullor , in some literature ) behaves as both the open circuit and shorted circuit : see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the significant fact about a nullator is that a nullator can not be realized using only passive elements , and moreover any realization ( necessarily active ) leads to the realization of both a nullator and its companion , the norator ; a norator is a two - terminal port that allows both the voltage across it and current through it to be arbitrary .",
    "we briefly review the main results in this paper .",
    "we first used the existence of an observable storage function as the definition of a system s dissipativity and proved that the dissipativities of a behavior and its controllable part are equivalent assuming the uncontrollable poles are unmixed and the dissipativity at infinity frequency is strict .",
    "this result s proof involved new results in the solvability of are and used indefinite linear algebra results .",
    "we showed that for lossless autonomous dissipative systems , the storage function can not be observable , thus motivating the need for unobservable storage functions .",
    "we then studied orthogonality / lossless behaviors in the context of using the definition of existence of a controllable dissipative superbehavior as a definition of dissipativity .",
    "in addition to results about the smallest controllable superbehavior , we showed necessary conditions on the number of inputs for embeddability of lossless / orthogonal behaviors in larger controllable such behaviors .    in the context of embeddability as a definition of dissipativity",
    ", we showed that one can always find behaviors that can be embedded in both a strictly dissipative behavior and a strictly ` anti - dissipative ' behavior , thus raising a question on the embeddability definition .",
    "we related this question to the well - known result that the nullator one - port circuit is not realizable using only rlc elements .",
