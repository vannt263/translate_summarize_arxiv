    "over the past several decades , much evidence has been compiled supporting the idea that the baryonic mass visible in galaxies ( stars , gas , and dust ) comprises a small fraction of the total gravitating mass of such a system .",
    "the earliest evidence comes from observations of galactic motions within larger galaxy cluster systems .",
    "individual galaxies had velocities that were too large to remain bound to the cluster , given the inferred amount of stellar mass @xcite . however , the uncertainties associated with this analysis were large , and it took several more decades for more conclusive evidence to emerge .",
    "the rotation curves ( circular speed versus galactocentric distance ) of spiral galaxies are considered to be one of the clearest pieces of evidence for what has become known as dark matter surrounding galaxies . in general , these curves show circular speeds of stars and gas in spiral galaxies following solid - body - like rotation near their centers , then reaching a nearly constant value @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with predictions based on the observed stellar / gas mass distributions in these galaxies , where the circular speed should peak and then decrease in the outer regions of a galaxy .",
    "further studies of stellar kinematics in elliptical galaxies can hint at the need for dark matter , but the dynamics of such systems are more complex than for spiral galaxies , and interpretations are not as clear @xcite .    in parallel with these inferences from galaxy dynamics ,",
    "the idea of dark matter has also been supported by cosmological investigations .",
    "numerical simulations of large - scale structure formation in the universe can reproduce the observed filamentary structure of galaxy clusters if dark matter is included @xcite .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background reveal features that can be described best when roughly 25% of the mass in the universe is dark matter @xcite .",
    "a third route of evidence for dark matter around galaxies involves observations of gravitational lensing .",
    "locations and magnifications of images of distant galaxies and quasars that form when their light is bent around intervening galaxies ( or clusters of galaxies ) indicate that the lensing galaxies should have masses larger than what can be accounted for from their visible components @xcite .",
    "the current paradigm assumes that dark matter must act collisionlessly .",
    "the argument supporting this assumption is as follows .",
    "observations indicating the presence of dark matter have not shown indications of an edge to the dark matter halo .",
    "for example , there are no isolated spiral galaxy rotation curves where the circular speed of gas begins to show a keplerian decrease at some distance . as a result",
    ", it is assumed that the dark matter structures around galaxies have much larger spatial extent than the visible components .",
    "the baryons that will eventually form stars ( mostly hydrogen gas ) are initially mixed with the dark matter over these larger volumes , but the baryons will self - interact via forces other than gravity .",
    "this gives the baryons a cooling mechanism that is unavailable to dissipationless dark matter and allows gas to radiate energy away and sink towards the center of the dark matter structure ( typically referred to as a halo ) .",
    "further , collisional effects would lead to halos with more spherical shapes that observations of galaxy clusters would allow @xcite .",
    "the previously mentioned cosmological simulations of structure formation have done more than simply suggest the reality of dark matter , they have also predicted its behavior on the scale of galaxies .",
    "it is generally agreed upon in the simulation community that dark matter halo mass density profiles have central cusps @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the logarithmic density profiles then monotonically steepen as one moves away from the center ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the consistency of the density behavior across mass scales , initial conditions , and simulation methods suggests that some simple underlying physics is at play in these self - gravitating collisionless systems .",
    "further investigations into the kinematics of dark matter systems have likewise heightened the suggestion of a fundamental physical process driving the formation of mechanical equilibrium dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "investigations of these three - dimensional ( 3-d ) systems involve a wide range of modes of evolution that contribute to the relaxation from initial conditions to a final equilibrium state .",
    "the radial orbit instability @xcite , along with evaporation and ejection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) , are examples of these modes .    the dynamics of collisionless systems of particles interacting via long - range forces is studied with the vlasov and poisson equations , which describe the evolution of the distribution of particles in phase space .",
    "there is a rich and on - going record of previous work related to this topic , both in astronomy and plasma physics .",
    "a good introduction to the literature related to vlasov - solver techniques may be found in @xcite , where those authors categorize previous methods of solution .",
    "one category is the `` water bag '' solution , first discussed by @xcite and utilized in an astrophysical setting by @xcite .",
    "this method tracks the boundary of a patch of a region of phase - space , inside which the distribution function is constant , but as the occupied phase - space becomes more filamentary due to phase mixing , following the boundary becomes more computationally costly .",
    "another route to solutions relies on grid - based techniques .",
    "an early , popular implementation came from plasma physics @xcite .",
    "astrophysical situations following the lead of @xcite arrived slightly later @xcite .",
    "resolution effects negatively affect the ability of grid - based codes to follow filamentary phase - space structures , but there are routes available to minimize this drawback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . especially in higher dimensions ,",
    "grid - based codes can have resolution limited by computational constraints , but the advent of graphics processing units is beginning to loosen these bounds @xcite . @xcite discuss an approach that is reminiscent of smoothed particle hydrodynamics for following phase - space evolution .",
    "this technique has several attractive aspects , but must , by its nature , deal with a coarse - grained distribution function .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the evolution of a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) self - gravitating collisionless system ( which can also be formulated as a  sheet  model ,",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "compared to 3-d models , the 1-d model is easier to analyze while possessing the essential features of 3-d systems  attractive long range forces and collisonless collective dynamics .",
    "however , it lacks some of the features of 3-d systems like angular momentum and tidal forces .",
    "though the model is formulated in terms of continuous distribution functions , it can also be considered as the @xmath4 limit of system of @xmath1 particles with masses @xmath5 , interacting via two - body gravitational attraction .",
    "the evolution of the phase - space distribution function is described by the the vlasov equation ( or collisionless boltzmann equation ) , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the normalized distribution function @xmath8 the @xmath9 argument is implied in what follows .",
    "the density is obtained simply by integrating over velocities @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total mass of the system ( mass per unit area in the sheet model , @xmath12 for particles ) .",
    "the acceleration @xmath13 for 1-d systems is calculated by simply taking the difference of the total masses on each side of @xmath14 , @xmath15 note the long - range nature of the interaction , which couples particles through the distance between them .",
    "likewise , the density is non - local in phase space , in that it involves an integral over velocities",
    ".    studies of such 1-d systems have a long history @xcite . in general , much of the work can be categorized by dealing with either cosmological conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where an additional non - self - gravitating potential energy term is included in the hamiltonian ( or periodic boundary conditions are used ) , or isolated systems where self - gravity is the only source of potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "within each of these categories , a variety of initial conditions have been investigated .",
    "broadly speaking , initial conditions are typically near - equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or far - from - equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several investigations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have focused on solving linearized versions of equation  [ cbe ] , a topic we discuss in more detail in   [ linear ] .",
    "the situations we investigate are isolated systems near thermal equilibrium .",
    "such non - equilibrium systems might be considered to be in the final stages of condensation from uniform cosmological conditions , or perhaps in the aftermath of a collision in which two systems coalesce / pass through one another .",
    "we note that the absence of tidal forces in 1-d guarantees that non - overlapping systems can be considered as isolated , so that our discussion also applies to clusters of non - overlapping systems between encounters .",
    "what follows here is a discussion of a method for finding solutions to a linearized version of equation  [ cbe ] .",
    "our solution to the linearized vlasov equation is different than many previous solutions that use an action - angle approach ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that approach",
    ", the linearized vlasov equation is transformed from a description in position - velocity coordinates to an action - angle representation .",
    "the resulting partial differential equation can then be reduced to an algebraic equation using fourier and laplace transforms .",
    "the evolution of a perturbed distribution function in the new variables is then , in principle , determined . with appropriate transforms , potential - density pairs can then be found .",
    "a major strength of this approach lies in its general nature ; perturbations are taken about any equilibrium state and external forces are incorporated simply .",
    "another advantage taken by the action - angle approach is the simplification afforded by the laplace transform to remove the time - derivative term in the vlasov equation .",
    "but while the various transforms can simplify the differential equation , they also introduce the need for inverse transforms .",
    "another issue arises from the connections between the position - velocity and action - angle representations .",
    "if one wants to define the initial system in terms of position - velocity coordinates , then transformations such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 must be known ( here , @xmath18 is energy and @xmath19 is the conjugate angle coordinate ) . likewise ,",
    "if the final position - velocity distribution function is desired , one needs @xmath20 . in general , the tranformations between variables involve numerical integrals , with continuous parameters , which have to be inverted .",
    "finally , density and potential functions are not simply connected to action - angle solutions and require expansions in bi - orthonormal functions .",
    "our approach is to expand the distribution function in terms of orthogonal functions .",
    "this method has been used previously , with hermite polynomials to describe the velocity aspect of distributions @xcite , and fourier expansions for the position for cosmological models with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the form of the thermal equilibrium distribution function for isolated systems very naturally suggests the use of hermite polynomials for the velocity and legendre polynomials in @xmath21 for the position .",
    "the resulting linear set of equations of motion link the expansion coefficients @xmath22 . in this notation , @xmath5 and @xmath23 are the orders of the hermite and legendre polynomials , respectively .",
    "there are few couplings between the coefficients  in fact , the couplings are local , in that they are only between neighbors on the @xmath24 grid .",
    "this is rather fortuitous in light of the long - range nature of the forces , and gives a simple local continuity - type evolution of coefficients on the @xmath24 grid .",
    "furthermore , the method provides an alternative to @xmath1-body simulations that yields smooth distribution functions , at least for modestly perturbed systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ thermeq ] , the properties of thermal equilibrium are summarized .",
    "the expansion of the distribution function in terms of hermite - legendre polynomials is developed in ",
    "[ ortho ] .",
    "the vlasov equation is linearized and the equations of motion of the expansion coefficients are obtained in section  [ linear ] .",
    "the behavior of solutions is discussed in section  [ sols ] .",
    "numerical considerations and comparisons with @xmath1-body simulations are presented in   [ sims ] .",
    "conclusions and future directions are discussed in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "based on the structure of equation  [ cbe ] , any function of the single particle energy , @xmath25 is a time - independent solution .",
    "thermal equilibrium is a special case which case the distribution function has the separable boltzmann form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an energy scale ( commonly referred to as the inverse temperature ) , and @xmath28 is a normalization constant . upon substitution of equations  [ spece]-[boltz ] into equation  [ cbe ] ,",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the thermal equilibrium distribution function , which is commonly written as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this is the well - known result that is presented in @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that this is also the @xmath4 limit for a system of @xmath1 equal mass particles in both canonical and micro - canonical ensembles .",
    "the potential corresponding to this equilibrium is , @xmath31 from which we obtain the acceleration @xmath32 in terms of the quantities defined , the kinetic energy of the equilibrium state is @xmath33 the equilibrium potential energy is likewise given by @xmath34 as required by the virial theorem for one dimension .",
    "the boltzmann nature of the one - dimensional self - gravitating system is a vital difference from the three - dimensional case .",
    "mechanical equilibria of realistic three - dimensional self - gravitating systems always contain gradients in the kinetic temperature , @xmath35 , that act as pressure support against gravity .",
    "only the infinite mass and energy isothermal sphere has a constant temperature .",
    "this one - dimensional distribution function is a true thermal equilibrium , as the kinetic temperature is uniform throughout the equilibrium system .    for simplicity , we transform to dimensionless coordinates using the definitions , @xmath36 the scaled equilibrium distribution function is , @xmath37 where tildes are used to indicate dimensionless functions , when a distinction is necessary .",
    "the vlasov equation transforms to , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dimensionless time and @xmath40 is the dimensionless acceleration function .",
    "the form of the equilibrium distribution function suggests a set of orthogonal functions to use as a basis for a polynomial expansion .",

    ", we can eliminate the factor @xmath53 with the change of variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 note that this substitution also maps infinite limits on any @xmath57 integral to the interval [ -1,1 ] .    at thermal equilibrium ,",

    ", one can see that mass density @xmath65 derives only from @xmath58 terms , @xmath66",
    "we now use the orthogonal polynomials developed in the previous section as a basis to study the dynamics of perturbations from thermal equilibrium .",

    ".    using this perturbed @xmath70 in equation  [ cbe ] produces a modified vlasov equation for the perturbing function ( in terms of the previously defined dimensionless quantities ) , @xmath71 where we have used @xmath72 .",
    "the accelerations are given by @xmath73 @xmath74 the term @xmath75 is required by newton s third law . in this equation , it has been written on the right hand side to signify that it is neither a convective nor an advective term .",

    "we now express the perturbing distribution function in terms of the hermite and legendre polynomials discussed earlier , @xmath77 where @xmath78 since the equilibrium contribution has already been removed .",
    "this guarantees that the perturbations are massless . using equation  [ lindens ] in equation  [ alpha1 ] ,",

    "_ dynamics the @xmath105 evolve by coupling to diagonal neighbors only .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in light of the long - range nature of the forces , and can be traced back to the recursion relation equation  [ recurint ] , that replaces the integral over @xmath57 in the calculation of @xmath95 .",
    "because of this nearest - diagonal - neighbor coupling , the even parity and odd parity modes completely decouple , where the parity is given by @xmath106 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall concern ourselves with the even parity modes only , and set all the odd parity coefficients to zero .",
    "this automatically guarantees that the center of mass velocity and position are zero , @xmath107 .    as discussed in section  [ intro ] , an action - angle approach is often used to solve the linearized vlasov equation .",
    "in contrast to this approach , our solution is specific to thermal equilibrium in the absence of any external potential , a comparative weakness .",
    "additionally , our approach does not take advantage of a laplace transform to remove the time derivative in the vlasov equation , leading to the need to solve an ordinary differential equation .",
    "such a transform might provide additional insight into our method , and we leave that as a future direction of work . despite these facts , we suggest that our solution leads to a more straightforward interpretation of perturbation evolution for self - gravitating systems than the action - angle approach affords .",
    "the more specific link between equilibrium and our choice of transforms leads to the simplifications of the nearest - neighbor and decoupling behaviors discussed in the previous paragraph and provides an easily visualized evolution in ( @xmath108 ) space .",
    "additionally , our method makes the initial value problem simple ",
    "specific @xmath109 perturbations can be easily represented by a set of @xmath105 via a simple projection operation .",
    "our approach also provides a straightforward calculation of the spatial dependence of acceleration and density functions .",
    "although we do not attempt to find a general solution of equation  [ cbelp ] on the entire @xmath24 domain , we can sketch the behavior of coefficients by considering some restricted situations . as a first case ,",
    "imagine that only the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 coefficients are available to be non - zero .",
    "this truncated @xmath114 system , although unrealistic , should be describe the behavior of @xmath111 for short times .",
    "the equations of motion found from equations  [ cbelp]-[ldef ] , @xmath115 the term in parentheses has the terms due to @xmath116 and @xmath95 separated ; for test particles only the first term is present . taking another time derivative and substituting gives @xmath117 for self - gravitation [ @xmath118 for test particles ] , indicating that the @xmath111 coefficient value should oscillate with a period @xmath119 for self - gravitation ( @xmath120 for test particles ) .",
    "the other coefficients @xmath110 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are proportional to @xmath121 so they oscillate @xmath122 out of phase with @xmath111 . in phase space , this behavior is a simple oscillation of two density peaks back and forth through the center of mass .",
    "results of solving equation  [ cbelp ] and numerical simulations ( see   [ sims ] ) agree with the frequencies found here for early times .",
    "time - independent solutions exist as well , even for this simple system .",
    "for example , @xmath123 is a normalized solution , where @xmath124 is a constant . in these respects ,",
    "the self - gravitating system is similar to a distribution of harmonic oscillators .",
    "however , the harmonic oscillator coefficients change only by coupling between coefficients with the same @xmath125 values ; for example , @xmath126 .",
    "the difference between this expression and the analogous relation in equation  [ sho ] reflects the fact that the particles in the harmonic potential do not experience phase mixing , while those in the gravitational case do .",
    "the most serious limitation with this simple picture is that we have ignored the coupling to higher polynomial terms .",
    "the result of this coupling is most easily analyzed in the large @xmath24 limit with gradual variations of @xmath105 on the @xmath24 grid .",
    "taking a second derivative of equation  [ cbelp ] and substituting the appropriate derivatives , one obtains , after specifying that @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 each of the terms in parentheses in equation  [ tpshm2 ] is a finite difference approximation to a second derivative , if @xmath23 were considered a continuous variable .",
    "if we consider only slowly varying dependence on @xmath5 , then the second line of equation  [ tpshm2 ] is approximately equal to the sum of the first and third lines , so that equation  [ tpshm2 ] simplifies to , @xmath130 this wave equation form suggests a simple visualization where the distribution in @xmath24 is propagated toward higher @xmath23 ( at increasing speeds @xmath131 ) . combining the findings of these two restricted cases ,",
    "we develop a picture of how coefficients behave during evolution .",
    "we expect low - order coefficients to oscillate but with a decreasing amplitude as they effectively radiate to higher - order coefficients .",
    "this contrasts with the phase - space description where the distribution function becomes filamentary as it `` winds up '' due to dephasing .",
    "in order to test the accuracy of the coefficient evolution approach in describing systems near equilibrium , we have numerically integrated equation  [ cbelp ] for simple initial perturbations .",
    "the results have been compared with @xmath132body simulations , for both test - particle and self - gravitating dynamics .",
    "although the agreement is excellent at short times and small perturbations , the differences are also important as they give insights into the relative importance of dephasing and self - gravitation in collisionless relaxation , finite @xmath1 and discreteness effects in @xmath132body simulations , and the impact of nonlinear effects .",
    "numerical solutions to equation  [ cbelp ] have been found using a midpoint method on a fixed - size @xmath133 grid . for initial conditions , we have used simple perturbations , consisting of one low - order excited mode , either the @xmath111 , @xmath112 , or @xmath110 . for boundary conditions ,",
    "we have tried several schemes , but ultimately settled on fixed boundaries , i.e.  @xmath134 .",
    "this is the simplest choice that also provides stable integrations .",
    "for these boundary conditions , @xmath135 and @xmath136 must be approximately 100 to get accurate @xmath137 values for low - order polynomials over their lifetime - typically a few linear oscillation periods @xmath138 .",
    "for stability , a fixed time step of @xmath139 has been adopted for the midpoint integration .",

    "figure  [ tind ] highlights the fact that ( 0,2 ) linear perturbations lead to time - independent solutions , as the initial amplitude in the ( 0,2 ) term decreases to a non - zero value as the ( 2,0 ) amplitude grows to a non - zero value [ similar results develop given an initial ( 2,0 ) perturbation ] .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the results of the simple coefficient system developed in section  [ sols ] .    as is evident in figures  [ diffevtp ] and  [ diffevlp ] , differences between @xmath161 and",
    "@xmath105 grow with time in both test - particle and self - gravitating cases . to test whether this difference is due to the truncation of the polynomial expansion",
    ", we have also solved the equations on a grid where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are twice the values used to calculate the curves in the figures above .",
    "the rms differences between the two @xmath105 are an order of magnitude smaller than the differences between @xmath161 and @xmath105 , so the root cause of the @xmath1-body / coefficient dynamics discrepancy lies in @xmath1 .",
    "as the number of particles in a simulation is increased from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , the differences between @xmath161 and @xmath105 diminish .",
    "we have created two self - gravitating ensembles with initial ( 1,1 ) perturbations and @xmath163 .",
    "one ensemble is formed from realizations using @xmath140 particles , the other uses @xmath141 .",
    "we have calculated the ratios between the rms @xmath1-body / coefficient dynamics differences and the error in the mean values for the ensemble . for the @xmath140 ensemble ,",
    "these ratios are 1.08 , 0.70 , and 0.89 for the ( 1,1 ) , ( 0,2 ) , and ( 2,0 ) terms , respectively . for the @xmath141 ensemble , the error in the mean values decrease by @xmath164 , but the rms @xmath1-body / coefficient dynamics differences decrease by a larger factor , producing ratios of 0.97 , 0.66 , and 0.83 for the ( 1,1 ) , ( 0,2 ) , and ( 2,0 ) terms , respectively .",
    "we interpret these results to mean that the coefficient dynamics solutions represent the truly collisionless behavior of the system for small enough perturbations , which the @xmath1-body simulations can only produce in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to the finite @xmath1 effects described above , @xmath1-body simulations always contain some degree of non - linearity that is not included in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "we have investigated the effects of non - linearity by tracking ensemble coefficient evolutions as perturbation strengths is increased .",
    "specifically , @xmath140 particle evolutions with initial ( 0,2 ) , ( 1,1 ) , and ( 2,0 ) perturbations have been performed , each with strengths @xmath163 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "table  [ btable ] quantifies the impact of perturbation strength .",
    "as one would expect , the growth of the difference ratios indicates the increased presence of non - linear effects in the @xmath1-body simulations . depending on a particular tolerance for discrepancies",
    ", one could set a limit on the maximum perturbation strength allowable for an evolution to remain in the linear regime .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have demonstrated that a set of orthonormal polynomial terms based on the equilibrium distribution function is useful for investigating the evolution of one - dimensional , self - gravitating , collisionless systems , at least for small linear perturbations from equilibrium .",
    "the polynomial coefficients interact via diagonal - neighbor couplings , producing an alternate view of the evolution of these systems in terms of coefficients @xmath105 on the @xmath24 grid .    from a simple `` wall clock '' point - of - view ,",
    "a coefficient evolution takes less time to perform than an ensemble calculation .",
    "for example , our midpoint method solution ( with the timestep discussed in section  [ sims ] ) on an @xmath167 , @xmath168 grid takes approximately twenty minutes to evolve to @xmath169 on a 3ghz microprocessor using a translator language like matlab or idl . on the same machine ,",
    "each equivalent self - gravitating @xmath140 realization of an ensemble takes approximately three minutes to evolve with efficient compiled fortran code .",
    "the 100 realization ensembles discussed in this work would have taken five hours to complete , if run serially .",
    "the computation time dramatically increases for larger particle numbers , mainly because of the shorter crossing times in the heap - sort algorithm .",
    "each @xmath141 realization takes approximately eight times as long as the @xmath140 version . beyond the time issue",
    ", the coefficient evolution approach allows one to follow the behavior of a perfectly smooth distribution function , instead of using density histograms as one must do in the @xmath1-body approach .",
    "having said that , coefficient evolutions exhibit their own shortcomings .",
    "the size of the @xmath105 grid that is used determines the resolution of the features of @xmath109 phase that can be represented .",
    "while we have not developed an analytical relationship between resolution scale and boundary size , there is a conceptual connection that is useful .",
    "if one thinks of the hermite polynomials used to describe velocity behavior , there are @xmath170 roots for the @xmath171 term .",
    "phase - space features that have velocity scales smaller than the spacing between the roots will not be properly captured by terms with @xmath172 and go unresolved by the coefficient dynamics approach .",
    "a similar argument may be made for the position aspect of any phase - space feature .",
    "for any given situation , one must make a decision regarding an acceptable level of phase - space resolution and then choose @xmath173 appropriately , a familiar situation when dealing with classical phase - space @xcite .    for a constant , uniform time - step , the stability of the midpoint method places a rather severe requirement on the size of @xmath174 .",
    "instabilities occur in the coefficients at large @xmath5 and @xmath23 where the derivatives are largest .",
    "we have found that @xmath175 for the stability of the midpoint method . as a result ,",
    "the number of calculations required for an @xmath176 grid scales like @xmath177 . in principle",
    ", one could use different time steps for different regions of phase space , but we did not explore this strategy , since the savings would be modest .    the biggest shortcoming of our approach , however , is the fact that boundary conditions of the grid limit the time that equation  [ cbelp ] can be used to accurately calculate low - order coefficients so that they can be considered effectively those of an unbounded system .",
    "the simple `` fixed '' boundary conditions we have used , where @xmath178 , reflect coefficient amplitude `` waves '' incident on the boundary back into the interior , where they propagate back toward the low - order coefficients near @xmath179 .",
    "the effect of this reflection at long times on the evolution @xmath113 is clearly evident in figure  [ c22damping ] .    to test the impact of the reflection on the coefficient evolution we have compared two grids , one with twice the dimensions of the other .",
    "while a strict quantitative measure is difficult , our investigations suggest that terms with @xmath180 calculated on an @xmath181 grid are in good agreement with the same terms calculated on an @xmath182 grid for @xmath183 .",
    "terms with smaller @xmath108 values show the best agreement between the two grid evolutions .",
    "it must also be remembered that only a finite range of @xmath108 terms can be accurately tracked during an @xmath1-body evolution . for the @xmath1-values adopted in this work",
    ", we have found that , even with ensemble averaging , the particle noise level is comparable to the amplitude of @xmath184 terms that arise . while it may be possible to design non - reflecting boundaries ( as one would do for the ordinary wave equation ) , we have not been able to find a scheme that is stable and provides significant improvement over fixed boundary conditions .",
    "another strategy that shows promise is to include a damping term in the evolution equations . instead of simply propagating toward large @xmath24",
    ", disturbances also decay so that the boundaries of the grid are never reached , avoiding distortions due to reflection .",
    "several varieties of damping term have been tested , and the most appealing has the form , @xmath185 where @xmath186 can be interpreted as a quality factor for the coefficient dynamics .",
    "this form has the advantage that the damping rate is proportional to the derivatives of the coefficients , and , other than a gradual decay of the disturbance , its impact on the dynamics of low - order coefficients seems to be minimal . in particular ,",
    "the oscillation frequencies are hardly affected , for small damping .",
    "figure  [ c22damping ] shows the time - behavior of the @xmath187 amplitude calculated with two different damping factors . in contrast to the effects of boundary reflections , which lead to complicated distortions throughout the ( @xmath108 ) grid , the effect of damping seems to be a simpler filtering of the amplitude .",
    "however , even with this simple form of damping it is not easy to obtain a formula for the region of validity of a coefficient evolution for a given @xmath188 .",
    "the simplest approach is to pick a grid size and then find the minimum @xmath189 that keeps the perturbation from reaching the boundaries . figure  [ xvt ] shows a reconstructed phase space plot for @xmath190 with a quality factor @xmath191 .",
    "regardless of the numerical technique adopted , this polynomial expansion analysis of the vlasov equation provides a novel , and useful , view of the behavior of one - dimensional self - gravitating systems .",
    "while not in the scope of this introductory work , one can imagine several directions any future investigations using this analysis might take .",
    "for example one might study the aftermath of the interactions of multiple isolated systems , investigating collisionless processes in the non - equilibrium remnant .",
    "additionally , determining the stationary states of one - dimensional systems or the frequency spectrum of the @xmath192 matrix could also be approached .",
    "one could extend the analysis to second - order to investigate the onset of nonlinear effects , like stability or chaotic behavior .",
    "the nearest - neighbor coupling of the coefficients leads to `` local '' continuity - type dynamics of conserved quantities like energy and fine - grained entropy on the @xmath24 grid that should give further insight into the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of these systems .",
