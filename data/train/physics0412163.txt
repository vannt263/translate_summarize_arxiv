    "one of the most ambitious challenges in mathematical modelling of biological processes is to describe dynamics of two major biological events within a cell - dna molecule replication and transcription . in both cases , dynamical properties , especially large amplitude",
    "conformational changes of the double - stranded dna molecule play a vital part .",
    "the principal physical feature of biological functioning of biomolecules is that they operate at ambient physiological temperature , pressure and solvent conditions .",
    "thus , the surrounding physiological solvent plays the role of a thermostat , among others . to properly thermostat this dynamics , especially on a biological ( `` slow '' ) time scale , we propose a suitable and effective temperature control for both the practice of numerical simulation and the general theory of dynamical systems .",
    "for a recent and comprehensive review of the problem outlined above we refer to @xcite .",
    "current approaches commonly use the nos - hoover thermostat method ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "this canonical thermostat method involves integration of both position and momentum phase space variables .",
    "however , for problems that are related to slow conformational changes of biomolecules , integration of fast momentum variables appears superfluous from a theoretical point of view ( unobservable variables ) as well expensive in the sense of numerical simulation .    in this letter , a novel approach to the problem of slow conformational changes in thermostatting dynamics",
    "is presented .",
    "the method is based on an analogy with the derivation of the smoluchowski dynamics  ( eq .  ( [ smoluchowski ] ) below ) from the langevin stochastic dynamics  ( eq .  ( [ langevin ] ) below ) @xcite .",
    "the configurational deterministic thermostat is constructed so as to effect the temperature control via certain dynamics of the relaxation rate variable and also involves a dynamically fluctuated collective force to ensure the ergodicity property . as the result , the temperature control is connected to the specific configurational temperature recently introduced in @xcite in a different context .",
    "the new configurational thermostat can be combined with complementary temperature control via a dynamically fluctuated virial function @xcite that helps to enhance the efficiency of the thermostat and , more importantly because biological molecules are functioning at a constant pressure , implements the pressure control into the corresponding dynamics . moreover ,",
    "the configurational thermostat admits stimulation by a chain of thermostats similar to nos - hoover @xcite and a stochastically driven method ( see below ) . to test the new configurational thermostat , corresponding simulations of",
    "a one - dimensional harmonic and the morse oscillator dynamics is given , providing a stringent test of the ergodicity property .",
    "remark : braga and travis @xcite have recently proposed a thermostat based on the smoluchowski equation and configurational temperature ideas ( but retaining the momentum variables ) , citing an early preprint of this paper @xcite .",
    "the early and successful attempts to describe the dynamics of a mechanical system being in contact with an environment playing a role of the thermostat is based on the concept of the stochastic differential equation @xcite .",
    "the case of one - dimensional motion of a particle mass @xmath3 in a potential field @xmath4 provides the characteristic example , @xmath5 where the friction coefficient @xmath6 and the intensity @xmath7 of the external random force @xmath8 are connected by the relation , @xmath9 ; here @xmath8 is the generalized gaussian stochastic process , white noise , with characteristic cumulants @xmath10 .",
    "the equilibrium solution of the corresponding fokker - planck equation @xcite is known , @xmath11   $ ] .    langevin s equation ( [ langevin ] ) is a prototype of the nos - hoover deterministic dynamics ( after generalisation of the last with the term @xmath12 as in eq .",
    "( [ vsdyn ] ) it is especially evident ) .",
    "but while the langevin dynamics generate all the sample trajectories and the corresponding measure , the nos - hoover dynamics produce a single sample trajectory with the correct canonical ensemble statistics when ergodicity holds .",
    "often details of the dynamics of a system on short time scales are not needed for a dynamical description of the observable variables . however , then the smoluchowski limit of ( [ langevin ] ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , is an appropriate formulation @xcite . the position variable only is involved in this equation .",
    "formally , it is supposed that the momentum variable relaxes to the local equilibrium state .",
    "the corresponding smoluchowski equation has the boltzmann distribution as the equilibrium solution @xcite .",
    "( [ smoluchowski ] ) , without the random perturbation , appears as a dissipative dynamics with @xmath4 playing a role of the lyapunov function , @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the full dynamics is a superposition of relaxation to a minimum of the potential and random perturbations that occasionally expel the system outside the vicinity of the minimum .",
    "this process equilibrates the system .",
    "it is reasonable , in the spirit of deterministic thermostat methods , to conjecture that it is possible to use the relaxation time @xmath16 for thermostatting configurational degrees of freedom when momentum variables are still relaxed in their local equilibrium state .",
    "of course , in this case the sign of @xmath16 is not fixed and @xmath17 loses its meaning as a lyapunov function . in a sense , it means that time can go back as well as forward .    first , consider the simple dynamical equations for @xmath18 degrees of freedom , @xmath19 where @xmath16 is a constant , but by analogy with nos - hoover will be endowed with its own equation of motion below . by the change of variables , @xmath20 , it is possible to exclude all masses from the formulae in what follows , but we prefer to save the physical notation . requiring that the corresponding liouville equation has the boltzmann distribution , @xmath21 $ ] , as a steady state solution , we arrive at the condition that involves the temperature in the dynamics , @xmath22   = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes summation over all particles of the system .",
    "after time averaging , eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) appears as the definition of the recently introduced so - called configurational temperature @xcite .",
    "currently it is used in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . in a more general context ,",
    "in the case of a presupposed anisotropy in the system , let us assume that @xmath16 in ( [ iso - s ] ) is a matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "then the dynamics take the form , @xmath25 , and the condition that involves the temperature in the dynamics is @xmath26   = 0.\\ ] ] note that this condition involves the presupposed time scales in the dynamical temperature control .",
    "conventional nos - hoover methods do not allow such a generalisation . in what follows",
    "we also consider @xmath16 as a scalar . on the other hand , it is useful to keep in mind the possibility of the generalisation .",
    "we now attempt to generate statistics as in the nos - hoover scheme by making @xmath16 an independent variable in  ( [ iso - s ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen that this is too simple . at an equilibrium point",
    "@xmath27 , that is , all forces are zero , the evolution comes to a halt and no longer fluctuates , irrespective of the time dependence of @xmath16 . for initial conditions with nonzero forces  ( [ iso - s ] ) after a ( positive or negative ) change of time variable , it is a gradient flow as defined in  @xcite , and it is easy to show that all trajectories move along paths in @xmath28 with equilibrium points at either end . in short ,",
    "the system is not ergodic .",
    "note also that  ( [ t ] ) is singular when @xmath29 .",
    "the way to overcome the difficulty is suggested by the smoluchowski stochastic equation . in this equation the ergodic motion is ensured by the random forcing .",
    "hence , we need to add a deterministic analogue of the random force term in  ( [ smoluchowski ] ) .",
    "let us consider , instead of ( [ iso - s ] ) , the dynamical equations , @xmath30 where @xmath12 are constant vectors , but they will be endowed with their own equation of motion below . to detail the nature of vectors @xmath12 , three principal cases are possible : ( a ) all @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is number of particle in the system , can be varied independently ; ( b ) all @xmath33 are varied identically ;",
    "( c ) there exist a preferred direction , @xmath34 , where @xmath34 is a constant unit vector of physical ( _ i.e. _ three dimensional ) space , and only one variable , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , is varied . requiring that the liouville equation corresponding to ( [ xi ] ) has the boltzmann distribution as a steady states solution and varying @xmath12 according to cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , together with temperature control condition ( [ t ] ) we correspondingly obtain",
    "the following conditions , @xmath37 these conditions do not involve temperature but the thermalized forces acting in the system .",
    "all of them , as well as atheir combination , are candidates for simulating the deterministic analogue of the random force , chosen according to the problem under consideration .",
    "for example , in respect of the peyrard - bishop dynamical model of the dna molecule @xcite , case ( c ) appears to be appropriate .",
    "the physical sense of the conditions above are the following .",
    "case ( a ) : the force acting on a particle in the system equals zero ( static equilibrium of forces ) .",
    "case ( b ) : the static equilibrium of forces is not required but the total force acting on the system equals zero ( stability of the system ) . case ( c ) : stability of the system in the direction @xmath34 .    it is practical to remark that a thermostatting dynamics more general than ( [ xi ] ) is possible , @xmath38 where the term @xmath39 is suggested by the virial thermostatting scheme that first appears in  @xcite in the context of the harmonic oscillator . requiring that the corresponding ( [ vsdyn ] ) liouville equation has the boltzmann distribution as a steady state solution we obtain together with ( [ t ] ) and [ fxi ] ) the following condition on the virial function , @xmath40 in this case a double temperature control is provided . the @xmath41 term is not a mandatory temperature control for our configurational thermostat .",
    "we could consider only the @xmath16 term by a trivial modification of  ( [ vsdyn ] ) and subsequent equations but consider a more general equations of the form ( [ vsdyn ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the virial function involves the pressure in the dynamics and this is important for biologically oriented models . for the sake of definiteness and keeping in mind a future application to the peyrard - bishop model of the dna dynamics we here fix case ( c )",
    "when @xmath35 is endowed with its own equation of motion , it provides a shaking of the system along the direction @xmath34 .",
    "now we have three parameters which we group together as a 3-vector @xmath42 . as in  ( [ t ] ) ,",
    "( [ fxi ] ) and ( [ v ] ) we find a stationary solution of the liouville equation of the form @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a positive definite real symmetric matrix .",
    "it is , of course , not possible to justify consistently that parameters @xmath45 have a gaussian distribution at equilibrium .",
    "it is just a reasonable assumption that leads to the simplest form of self - consistent thermostat dynamics .",
    "intuitively , we can justify the gaussian character of the parameters at equilibrium by the limiting theorems of probability theory .",
    "note that when multiple thermostats are present , they are usually assumed to be uncoupled ( diagonal @xmath44 ) ; mathematically it is not required and we do not feel that this is physically necessary , thus we consider that the more general case of coupled thermostats may be useful .",
    "for comparison with the uncoupled case we define @xmath46 to be the matrix with only the diagonal components of @xmath44 .",
    "( [ t ] ) becomes @xmath47{c}% \\sum\\frac{1}{m}\\left [   ( \\nabla v)^{2}-k_{\\mathrm{b}}t\\delta v\\right ] \\\\",

    "v \\end{array } \\right )   = 0,\\ ] ] which now defines @xmath48 .",
    "let us realize the main conjecture the configurational thermostat scheme and allow the components of @xmath45 to fluctuate so that  ( [ vstemp ] ) holds only after time averaging ; we write @xmath49 where @xmath50 is as yet an undetermined vector of functions . now requiring the same condition for the solution of the liouville equation we find that the only solution is @xmath51 thus the only undetermined parameters of our thermostatting scheme are the components of the positive definite real symmetric matrix @xmath44 , and in the uncoupled case @xmath52 we have @xmath53 .",
    "we can now ask whether the addition of new variables @xmath41 and/or @xmath35 will remove the lack of ergodicity implied by the potential flow argument applying to  ( [ iso - s ] ) .",
    "a partial answer is provided by the frobenius theorem of differential geometry  @xcite , which in our case states that an integral surface exists ( hence the dynamics are definitely not ergodic ) if a vector space containing the terms in the equation for @xmath28 but smaller than the full phase space is closed under lie brackets .",
    "for realistic potentials ( not the harmonic oscillator ) this is very unlikely since multiple derivatives of @xmath17 are almost always linearly independent .",
    "if the theorem does not apply we are in the same situation as for nonthermostatted nonintegrable many particle systems , which are often assumed to be ergodic , at least for practical purposes .",
    "since under the transformation @xmath54 the equations of motion ( [ vsdyn ] ) and ( [ alphadot ] ) are still unchanged , they are time reversible .    to find a mechanically important integral of motion of system ( [ vsdyn ] )",
    ", we need to add a redundant variable .",
    "indeed , consider the balance of the mechanical work along trajectories of eqs .",
    "( [ vsdyn ] ) and ( [ alphadot]),@xmath55 to obtain an exact differential equation , it is necessary to set@xmath56 in that case , the following first integral takes place,@xmath57 since the origin of the redundant variable @xmath58 is arbitrary , it is always possible for an arbitrary fixed trajectory to set @xmath59 .",
    "this integral of motion is useful as a control parameter in numerical simulations . besides",
    ", it clearly relates to the equilibrium distribution @xmath60 and thus can be considered as a first step to reformulation of eqs .",
    "( [ vsdyn])-([alphadot ] ) in terms of a free energy functional .",
    "recall that the corresponding nos - hoover integral of motion  @xcite is given by its hamiltonian - no hamiltonian is possible here since the momentum does not appear explicitly .",
    "since the configurational dynamics above result in the gaussian equilibrium fluctuation of thermostat variables , the latter admits reinforcing by a chain of equations analogous to the nose - hoover chain thermostat @xcite .",
    "the chain method consists in including a subsidiary sequence of dynamical variables , @xmath61 , into a thermostat scheme such that asymptotically , in the equilibrium distribution , they are independent gaussian variables , @xmath62.\\ ] ] the corresponding dynamics are not unique . we have obtained a clear method for generalizing the chain , but since this does not directly relate to our main topic we do not discuss the details .",
    "instead we cite the example of the chain rule that has been used in our test simulation , @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "it is a simple chain of total length @xmath65 .",
    "it should also be noted that in spite of its popularity , the effectiveness of the chain method for computing non - equilibrium properties has been questioned @xcite .",
    "it is possible to stimulate the gaussian fluctuation of the thermostat variables by the process of brownian motion .",
    "this scheme has the advantage of ensuring the ergodicity property .",
    "the stimulation , similar to the chain one , may be done in a few ways , applying to one or more of the variables @xmath16 , @xmath41 and @xmath35 . in general",
    "we have@xmath66 where now @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positive definite real symmetric matrices , and @xmath69 is a vector of independent white noise components . the liouville equation corresponding to ( [ stst ] ) , averaged over all the realizations of @xmath69 , has the form of the fokker - planck equation and the boltzmann distribution as a steady state solution only if @xmath70 we consider that the most physical case is when the noise is used only for temperature control , that is , for @xmath16 and @xmath41 only .",
