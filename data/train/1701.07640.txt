    "the generation and verification of nonclassical light is one of the main challenges for realizing optical quantum communication and computation @xcite .",
    "the needed protocols and resources are becoming more and more sophisticated .",
    "however , robust and easily applicable methods are required to verify quantum features in order to employ quantum states of light for real - world applications ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the complexity of producing reliable sensors stems from the problem that new detectors need to be characterized initially . for this task ,",
    "various techniques have been proposed , e.g. , detector tomography @xcite .",
    "however , such a calibration requires many resources , for example , computational / numerical efforts , reference measurements , etc . only after this handling , the interaction between quantum light and the bulk material of the detector can be inferred and quantum features can be uncovered .",
    "the latter verification of quantumness also depends on the bare existence of criteria that are applicable to this measurement . here",
    ", we will prove that detectors with a general response to incident light can be employed in an optical detection scheme , which is well - characterized , to identify nonclassical radiation fields based on simple nonclassicality conditions .",
    "the concept of device - independent verification of quantumness has recently gained a lot of importance , because it allows one to employ even untrusted devices ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for instance , device - independent entanglement witnesses can be used without relying on properties of the measurement system @xcite .",
    "it has been further studied to perform communication and computation tasks @xcite .",
    "detector - independence has been also applied to state estimation and quantum metrology @xcite to gain knowledge about a physical system which might be too complex for a full characterization .",
    "an equivalently remarkable progress has been made in the field of well - characterized photon - number - resolving ( pnr ) detectors @xcite .",
    "a charge - coupled - device camera is one example of a system that can record many photons at a time .",
    "the correlation between different pixels can be used to infer quantum correlated light @xcite .",
    "another example of a pnr device is a superconducting transition - edge sensor ( tes ) @xcite .",
    "this detector requires a cryogenic environment and its operation is based on superconductivity .",
    "hence , a proper detection model for this detector would require the quantum mechanical treatment of a solid - state bulk material which interacts with a quantized radiation field in the frame of low - temperature physics .",
    "along with the development of pnr detectors , multiplexing layouts define another approach to realize photon - number resolution @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that an incident light field , which consists of many photons , is split into a number of spatial or temporal modes , which consist of a few photons only .",
    "these resulting beams are measured with single - photon detectors which do not have any photon - number - resolution capacity .",
    "they can only discriminate between the presence ( `` click '' ) and absence of absorbed photons .",
    "hence , the multiplexing is used to get some insight into the photon - statistics despite the limited capacity of the individual detectors . with its resulting binomial click - counting statistics",
    ", one can verify nonclassical properties of correlated light fields @xcite .",
    "recently , a multiplexing layout has been used in combination with tess to characterize quantum light with a mean photon number of 50 and a resolution of up to 80 photons for each of the two correlated modes @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we formulate a method to verify quantum light with arbitrary detectors .",
    "this technique is based on a well - defined multiplexing scheme and individual detectors which can discriminate different measurement outcomes .",
    "the resulting correlation measurement is always described as a mixture of multinomial distributions in classical optics .",
    "based on this finding , we formulate nonclassicality conditions in terms of covariances whose violation directly certifies nonclassical light .",
    "we implement our approach for quantum light which is produced by heralding photon - number states from a parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) source .",
    "we show that a single multiplexing step is already sufficient to verify the nonclassicality of such states without the need of characterizing the used tess .",
    "the detection scenario under study is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : theory ] .",
    "its detector - independence is achieved by the multiplexing layout whose optical elements , e.g. , beam splitters , are much simpler and better characterized than the detectors .",
    "our only broad requirement is that the measured statistics of the detectors are relatively similar to each other .",
    "in contrast to the typical idea of multiplexing , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not seek for a higher photon - number resolution , but we employ this scheme to get nonclassicality criteria that are independent of the properties of the individual detectors .     individual detectors .",
    "incident light is split into @xmath0 beams with similar intensities .",
    "each of the @xmath0 detectors returns a measurement outcome @xmath1 .",
    "the number of detectors @xmath2 with the same outcome @xmath3 is recorded . ,",
    "width=226 ]    first , we consider a single coherent , classical light field .",
    "the detector can resolve arbitrary outcomes @xmath4or , equivalently , @xmath5 bins  which have a probability @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the probability to have a coincidence @xmath7 from @xmath0 individual and identical detectors is @xmath8 after the @xmath9 splittings in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ] .",
    "further on , the integer @xmath2 represents the number of individual detectors that measure simultaneously the outcome @xmath10 .",
    "this means we have @xmath11-times the outcome @xmath12 together with @xmath13-times the outcome @xmath14 , etc . from the @xmath15 detectors .",
    "the probability to get @xmath16 in such scenario is known to be described by a multinomial distribution @xcite , @xmath17 to ensure a general applicability , we counter any deviation from the @xmath9 splitting and differences of the individual detectors by determining a corresponding systematic error ( in our experiment in the order of @xmath18 ) which basically quantifies the asymmetry in the recoded data .",
    "a detailed error analysis is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a different intensity , the probabilities @xmath6 of the individual outcomes",
    "@xmath10 might change .",
    "hence , if we consider a statistical mixture of arbitrary intensities , we can generalize the distribution in eq . by averaging over a classical probability distribution @xmath19 , @xmath20 because any light field in classical optics can be considered as an ensemble of coherent fields @xcite , the measured statistics of the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ] can be described as a mixture of multinomial distributions .",
    "this is not necessarily true for quantum light as we will demonstrate .",
    "the distribution applies to arbitrary detectors and includes the case of on - off detectors ( @xmath21 ) , which yields a binomial distribution and has been previously considered @xcite .",
    "in addition , we even determine the number of outcomes , @xmath5 , directly from our data .",
    "let us now formulate a criterion that allows for the identification of quantum correlations .",
    "the mean values of multinomial statistics obey @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "multiplying eq . with @xmath0 and using eq . , we can introduce the @xmath31 matrix @xmath32    as the covariance matrix @xmath33 is nonnegative for any classical probability distribution @xmath19 , we can conclude : we have a nonclassical light field if @xmath34 i.e. , the symmetric matrix @xmath35 in eq",

    "when photons are absorbed , the increase in temperature causes a corresponding electrical signal which is picked up and amplified by a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) module and subsequently amplified at room temperature .",

    "our heralding tes allows for a resolution of @xmath51 outcomes . due to the splitting of the photons on the beam splitter in the multiplexing step , the data from the other two tess yield a reduced distinction between @xmath52 outcomes",

    "<S> we introduce a method for the verification of nonclassical light which is independent of the complex interaction between the generated light and the material of the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by an optical multiplexing scheme . </S>",
    "<S> its theoretical description yields that the coincidence statistics of this measurement layout is a mixture of multinomial distributions for any classical light field and any type of detector . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to formulate bounds to the statistical properties of classical states . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our directly accessible method to heralded multi - photon states which are detected with a single multiplexing step only and two detectors , which are in our work superconducting transition - edge sensors . </S>",
    "<S> the nonclassicality of the generated light is verified and characterized through the violation of the classical bounds without the need for characterizing the used detectors . </S>"
