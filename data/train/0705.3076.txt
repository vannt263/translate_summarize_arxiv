    "the proof that @xmath13 can not satisfy ( ac-1 ) and ( ac-2 ) relies essentially on the fact that the definition for each of these crossing patterns involves elements from _ only two _ orbits of @xmath13 .",

    "[ remark5.11 ] at this moment we narrowed down quite a bit the possibilities for how it can happen that @xmath549 , but @xmath550 : we must have that @xmath460 is @xmath119-connected and without inversion - invariant blocks ( because of corollaries [ corollary5.5 ] and [ corollary5.8 ] ) , and the permutation @xmath13 constructed in proposition [ proposition5.10 ] must display the crossing pattern ( ac-3 ) .",
    "it is somewhat disappointing to see that if @xmath50 , this one possibility that was left ( with @xmath13 displaying the crossing pattern ( ac-3 ) ) _ can in fact occur_. this is immediately seen by looking at the example where @xmath551 and @xmath552 for @xmath553 in fact , if @xmath50 then one can argue directly that @xmath1 is not a lattice , in the following way : let @xmath554 be as in ( [ eqn:5.2 ] ) , and consider on the other hand the permutations @xmath555 we denote @xmath556 , @xmath557 , @xmath558 , @xmath559 .",

    "this detail really turns out to be essential  in the next section we will see that it is possible to `` finish the argument '' for the fact that @xmath570 , if we place ourselves in the particular situation when @xmath571 and @xmath5 .",
    "this section is a continuation of section 5 , and inherits all the notations used there ( @xmath230 , @xmath572 , with the specification that the positive integers @xmath77 are now set to be @xmath573 so the set @xmath82 continues to be @xmath574 , but @xmath148 and @xmath149 have now become @xmath575 @xmath119 is the permutation @xmath576 and so on .",
    "our goal for the section is to present the proof of theorem [ theorem3 ] , which states that @xmath52 is a lattice .",
    "[ remark6.1 ] it is easily seen that in order to prove theorem [ theorem3 ] , all we need to do is prove that @xmath53 is closed under the operation `` @xmath454 '' of intersection meet which was reviewed at the beginning of section 5 .",
    "indeed , once this is established , it becomes clear that every @xmath577 have a greatest common lower bound in @xmath53 , which is precisely their intersection meet ; hence `` @xmath454 '' really gives a meet operation on @xmath53 . on the other hand",
    "it is obvious that @xmath53 has a largest element , the partition of @xmath82 into only one block ; and it is easily checked that a finite poset with a meet operation and which has a largest element has to be a lattice ",
    "see e.g. proposition 3.3.1 in the monograph @xcite .",
    "[ remark6.2 ] let @xmath578 be two partitions in @xmath53 , and consider their intersection meet @xmath579 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath460 is @xmath119-connected and has no inversion - invariant blocks , and let @xmath13 be the permutation of @xmath82 defined as in proposition [ proposition5.10 ] above : the orbit partition of @xmath13 is equal to @xmath460 , and for every block @xmath29 of @xmath460 we have that @xmath516 ( the canonical permutation of @xmath29 introduced in definition [ definition4.4 ] ) .",
    "we will spend most part of the present section by examining whether @xmath13 can display the crossing pattern ( ac-3 ) , in order to eventually conclude that this can not happen .",
    "so let us assume that @xmath13 does satisfy ( ac-3 ) , i.e. that there exist six distinct elements @xmath580 such that @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and where we have @xmath581 in the current remark we make some observations about what this entails , and we set some notations .",
    "the main observation we want to record here is that _ exactly one of the sets @xmath332 and @xmath329 is @xmath119-connected .",
    "_ indeed , it is clear that @xmath332 and @xmath329 ca nt both be @xmath119-connected , as this would imply that among @xmath582 there are three distinct elements of @xmath149 ( namely @xmath162 , one element from @xmath583 and one from @xmath584 ) ; this is not possible , since @xmath585 only has two elements .",
    "suppose on the other hand that neither of @xmath332 and @xmath586 are @xmath119-connected , i.e. that each of them is either contained in @xmath148 or contained in @xmath149 .",
    "note it is not possible to have @xmath323 or @xmath587 .",
    "indeed , if we had for instance that @xmath323 then it would follow that @xmath588 this would lead to @xmath589 and would imply that @xmath13 satisfies the crossing pattern ( ac-1 ) , in contradiction to proposition [ proposition5.10 ] .",

    "but this situation ca nt occur either , because , as explained in remark [ remark4.4].3 , it is not compatible with the assumption that @xmath594 .",
    "hence we know that exactly one of @xmath332 and @xmath329 is @xmath119-connected . by doing a circular permutation of @xmath271 ( which does not affect the two equalities from ( [ eqn:6.2 ] ) )",
    "we may assume that @xmath332 is @xmath119-connected , and moreover , that @xmath595 and @xmath596 .",
    "now , @xmath597 and @xmath162 are distinct elements of @xmath149 ; since @xmath598 , we deduce that @xmath599 and the remaining four elements @xmath600 that play a role in ( [ eqn:6.2 ] ) all belong to @xmath148 .",
    "it is useful to also record here that the cyclic order of @xmath600 on @xmath148 is given by the formula @xmath601 this follows immediately by using the assumption ( [ eqn:6.2 ] ) that @xmath602 , and by checking how the long cycle of @xmath160 goes , when one starts at the point @xmath595 .",
    "in what follows we will denote by @xmath531 and @xmath603 the three distinct orbits of @xmath13 ( equivalently , blocks of @xmath460 ) which contain @xmath332 , @xmath329 and @xmath530 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath604 , we can write @xmath605 where @xmath606 are blocks of @xmath44 and @xmath607 are blocks of @xmath43 . note that we have the relations @xmath608 which hold because @xmath609 and @xmath610 .",

    "we next observe that @xmath655 is distinct from @xmath656 because @xmath657 , @xmath658 ( by ( [ eqn:6.8 ] ) ) , and @xmath659 ( by ( [ eqn:6.7 ] ) ) ; a similar argument shows that @xmath660 ( we have @xmath661 , @xmath662 , and @xmath663 ) .    we consider the cyclic permutation induced by @xmath119 on the set @xmath664 . since we know that @xmath665 , there are in fact only four possibilities for what @xmath666 can be .",

    "the results of the paper were stated in the introduction in the framework of the groups @xmath12 , but all three theorems [ theorem1 ] , [ theorem2 ] and [ theorem3 ] have counterparts that hold in the framework of the weyl groups @xmath679 . in this section we present these counterparts of type d.    we will use the notations @xmath680 , @xmath229 , @xmath681 that were introduced in section 3 .",

    "the length function @xmath684 then defines a partial order on @xmath679 , by the same kind of formula as used in type b : for @xmath688 we put @xmath689    now , the counterpart of type d for theorem [ theorem1 ] turns out to follow easily from the theorem itself , due to the following easily checked observation about length functions : the length function @xmath684 on @xmath679 is in fact _ the restriction _ to @xmath679 of the length function of type b , @xmath102 on @xmath12 .",
    "this in turn implies that for @xmath688 we have the equivalence @xmath690 but then we immediately get that :          [ cor:7.2 ] let us denote @xmath693 then the map @xmath694 is a poset isomorphism , where @xmath7 is partially ordered as an interval of @xmath679 , while @xmath8 is partially ordered by reverse refinement .    from the equivalence ( [ eqn:1.154 ] ) it follows that the partial order considered on @xmath7 is the one induced from @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    "it is clear that the partial order on @xmath8 is the one induced from @xmath1 ( since for @xmath695 the inequality `` @xmath42 '' means that every block of @xmath43 is a union of blocks of @xmath44 , and this is independent of whether @xmath415 are viewed as elements of @xmath8 or as elements of @xmath1 ) .",
    "but then the fact that in ( [ eqn:1.156 ] ) we have a poset isomorphism follows by appropriately restricting the poset isomorphism ( [ eqn:1.06 ] ) from theorem [ theorem2 ] .    finally , let us discuss the counterpart of type d for theorem [ theorem3 ] .",
    "this does hold , that is , @xmath74 is a lattice with respect to the partial order given by reverse refinement .",

    "so here a different kind of argument is required ; but we are fortunate that we only need to invoke the work previously done by athanasiadis and reiner in the paper @xcite .",
    "we conclude by pointing out a couple of clues that have to be followed in order to make the connection between the poset @xmath697 from @xcite and the poset @xmath74 of this paper .",
    "the construction made in @xcite goes by drawing @xmath698",
    "@xmath699 around a circle , and by placing both @xmath700 and @xmath701 at the center of the circle .",
    "but if instead of putting @xmath700 and @xmath701 right at the center we put them on a small circle concentric with the one containing @xmath702 , then the partitions considered in the definition of @xmath75 ( see beginning of section 3 in @xcite ) become _ annular _ non - crossing .",
    "another point in @xcite which looks puzzling at first sight is that if a partition @xmath703 has a zero - block ( a block @xmath57 such that @xmath653 ) , then @xmath704 are forced to belong to that block .",
    "but this corresponds exactly to the passage from @xmath30 to @xmath46 in notation [ def:1.2 ] .",

    "<S> here we have to check that every orbit @xmath345 of @xmath316 satisfies the conditions ( i)+(ii ) of definition [ def:2.8].1 , in the appropriate reformulation where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are replaced by @xmath57 and @xmath203 . and indeed , these reformulated conditions ( i)+(ii ) are immediate consequences of the corresponding conditions ( i)+(ii ) satisfied by @xmath346 , and where we use the same @xmath345 . in order to illustrate what happens , </S>",
    "<S> let us work out for instance the condition ( i ) . in the reformulation for @xmath316 , this condition has the form @xmath347 where @xmath345 is an orbit of @xmath107 such that @xmath348 . </S>",
    "<S> so we are required to check that @xmath107 and @xmath119 induce the same permutation on @xmath349 . </S>",
    "<S> but the corresponding condition which we know to be satisfied by @xmath107 is that @xmath350 , and this does indeed imply that @xmath351 , since @xmath352 .    </S>",
    "<S> the verification that @xmath316 does not display any of the annular crossing patterns ( ac-1 ) , ( ac-2 ) , ( ac-3 ) with respect to @xmath310 goes along the same lines as in the preceding paragraph . that is , if @xmath316 displayed a crossing pattern ( ac-@xmath113 ) with respect to @xmath310 ( where @xmath353 ) , then the same set of 4 , 5 or 6 points of @xmath29 could be used to infer that @xmath107 displays the crossing pattern ( ac-@xmath113 ) with respect to @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> the straightforward verification of this fact is left to the reader . </S>",
    "<S> we only note here that when treating the crossing patterns ( ac-2 ) and ( ac-3 ) one has to take into account the following simple observation : if @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and @xmath356 is the ac - test permutation defined as in equation ( [ eqn:2.11 ] ) of notation [ def:2.7 ] , then the counterpart of @xmath357 in connection to @xmath358 coincides with @xmath359 .

    "<S> now , from the hypothesis that @xmath363 it follows that @xmath364 , since the blocks of @xmath365 ( respectively @xmath299 ) are obtained by intersecting the blocks of @xmath366 ( respectively the blocks of @xmath90 ) with @xmath148 . but proposition [ prop:3.2 ] gives us that @xmath367 ; so if we know that @xmath368 , then we can invoke the poset isomorphism reviewed in ( [ eqn:1.08 ] ) of subsection 1.2 to conclude that @xmath361 in @xmath190 . </S>",
    "<S> the inequality @xmath362 in @xmath191 is obtained in a similar manner .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath107 can not have inversion - invariant orbits either . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath369 and @xmath370 , thus our hypothesis is that @xmath371 .    </S>",

    "<S> then @xmath29 is a union of orbits of @xmath107 , and lemma [ lemma4.13 ] gives us that @xmath372 . observe that @xmath373 thus equation ( [ eqn:2.06 ] ) from subsection 2.4 gives us that @xmath374 ) let us sum over all orbits @xmath29 of @xmath13 , where we take into account that every orbit of @xmath107 is contained in precisely one orbit of @xmath13 , and that ( consequently ) the same is true for every orbit of @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath375    finally , we convert equation ( [ eqn:4.13 ] ) into a formula which involves lengths in @xmath12 . if a permutation @xmath109 has no inversion - invariant orbits , then the relation between the length @xmath376 and the number of cycles @xmath377 is @xmath378 this formula applies to each of @xmath379 and @xmath13 ( where in the case of @xmath111 , the absence of inversion - invariant orbits follows from the inequality @xmath380 ) . by substituting this into ( [ eqn:4.13 ] ) we get precisely that @xmath381 = @xmath382 , and the required </S>",
    "<S> inequality @xmath289 follows .    </S>",

    "<S> _ @xmath107 and @xmath13 are neither as in case 1 nor as in case 2 .    in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 must have inversion - invariant orbits ( otherwise case 2 would apply ) . </S>",
    "<S> proposition [ prop:3.4 ] thus implies that @xmath13 is @xmath119-disconnected . </S>",
    "<S> but then @xmath107 has to be @xmath119-connected , otherwise case 1 would apply . from the given inequality @xmath286 and the fact that @xmath107 is @xmath119-connected we next infer that the partition @xmath46 is @xmath119-connected .    in the preceding paragraph </S>",
    "<S> we saw that @xmath13 is @xmath119-disconnected , but the partition @xmath46 is @xmath119-connected . </S>",
    "<S> the only way this can happen is if @xmath13 has exactly two inversion - invariant orbits , an orbit @xmath383 and an orbit @xmath384 . </S>",
    "<S> then , denoting @xmath385 , we have that @xmath386 is the unique @xmath119-connected block of @xmath46 ( while all the other blocks of @xmath46 are actual orbits of @xmath13 , and each of them is either contained in @xmath148 or contained in @xmath149 ) . in the preceding paragraph </S>",
    "<S> we also saw that @xmath107 is @xmath119-connected ; note that , due to the inequality @xmath387 , all the @xmath119-connected orbits of @xmath107 must be contained in @xmath386 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now start to count orbits of @xmath107 and of @xmath111 , in the same way as we did in case 2 . for every orbit @xmath29 of @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> such that @xmath388 we have that @xmath29 is a union of orbits of @xmath107 and we can do exactly the same calculation as shown in case 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain , analogously to equation ( [ eqn:4.12 ] ) from case 2 , that @xmath389    on the other hand , @xmath390 also is a union of orbits of @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> lemma [ lemma4.14 ] applies to this situation , and gives us that @xmath391 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to replace here @xmath392 by @xmath393 ( the equality @xmath394 is the combination of the two equalities @xmath395 and @xmath396 , which hold because @xmath13 is compatible with @xmath119 , in the sense of definition [ def:2.8 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so we obtain that @xmath397 , and the genus formula for @xmath398 and @xmath393 gives us that @xmath399 ( on the right - hand side of ( [ eqn:4.16 ] ) we used @xmath400 rather than `` @xmath401 '' because we know that @xmath398 is @xmath402-connected . </S>",
    "<S> the latter fact is in fact a consequence of the fact @xmath107 has @xmath119-connected blocks which are contained in @xmath386 . )    </S>",
    "<S> let us now sum in equation ( [ eqn:4.15 ] ) over all the orbits @xmath403 of @xmath13 , and let us also add equation ( [ eqn:4.16 ] ) to the result of that summation . </S>",
    "<S> we get ( analogously to equation ( [ eqn:4.13 ] ) from case 2 ) that @xmath404    finally , we convert equation ( [ eqn:4.17 ] ) into a formula which involves lengths in @xmath12 . we leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify that the permutations @xmath107 and @xmath111 do not have inversion - invariant orbits ( the verification has only one non - trivial point , namely the absence of inversion - invariant orbits of @xmath405 , which is obtained by applying a `` re - denoted '' version of proposition [ prop:3.4 ] to the permutation @xmath406 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the conversion from @xmath407 and @xmath408 to the lengths @xmath409 and @xmath410 is done via the same formula ( [ eqn:4.14 ] ) as we used in case 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the permutation @xmath13 has two inversion - invariant orbits , hence the formula used for @xmath13 has to be @xmath411 when we use these formulas in order to rewrite equation ( [ eqn:4.17 ] ) in terms of lengths in @xmath12 , we get that @xmath412 = @xmath100 , and the required inequality @xmath289 is obtained in this case as well .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is clear that theorem [ theorem2 ] now follows , when we combine the statements of proposition [ prop:4.9 ] and of proposition [ proposition4.15 ] .    </S>",
