    "the figures of merit for the off - resonance , electronic nonlinear optical response are the scale - free , _ intrinsic _ , fully symmetric third and fourth rank hyperpolarizability tensors @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , whose magnitudes are limited by@xcite    @xmath2    and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state , m is the electron mass , e is its charge , and n is the number of electrons .",
    "figures of merit are then defined by normalizing the first and second hyperpolarizabilities to these maxima , viz .",
    "@xmath5 the second hyperpolarizability normalized this way has a largest negative value equal to @xmath6 of the maximum value .",
    "the existence of limits results from the physical constraints that the quantum system , described by a self - adjoint hamiltonian operator , necessarily satisfies the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rules@xcite .",
    "the first ( intrinsic ) hyperpolarizability is a sum over states : @xmath7 which implicitly defines the eigenfunction density for @xmath0 . in eq .",
    "( [ betaint ] ) , the prime indicates that the sum excludes the ground state , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are normalized transition moments and energies , defined by @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and where @xmath16 @xmath17 represents the largest possible transition moment value of @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath0 is scale - invariant and can be used to compare molecules of different shapes and sizes .",

    "( [ gammaint ] ) to each achieve a maximum value of unity .",
    "however , it is an empirical fact that all nonlinear optical materials discovered to date fall short of the maximum allowed values , most by over an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "this is a rather profound observation , inasmuch the search for highly active nonlinear materials is well over 40 years old and continues today . to explore",
    "why this is so , analytical studies of the space of possible sets of transition moments and spectra restricted only by the trk sum rules were carried out using monte carlo methods with the result that the maxima may be achieved , at least numerically@xcite , though the nature of the hamiltonian that can produce these is still unknown .",
    "subsequent studies began with specific potentials and calculated the spectra and states directly in an effort to discover the optimum potential for maximum response .",
    "the shapes of optimized potentials that have the largest hyperpolarizabilities were used to propose modulated conjugation as one new design guideline for making better molecules.@xcite searches using the concept of modulation of conjugation led to the discovery of molecules with record hyperpolarizabilities@xcite at that time , still well short of the fundamental limits .    however , three major results emerged from the potential optimization studies .",
    "the first is that the theoretical maximum for @xmath22 appears to assume a value that is about @xmath23 , not unity . for @xmath24 ,",
    "both extremes appear to be exactly sixty percent of the theoretical limits , viz , @xmath25 .",
    "recent examination of the origin of the limits has suggested that the true limits are indeed those from potential optimization and not those determined solely by the sum rules @xcite .",
    "corroborating results have also been provided @xcite , but have shown that optimization poorly determines the potential .",
    "the second major result is that all systems known to date satisfy a set of empirical observations known collectively as the three - level ansatz ( tla ) , whereby a structure that appears to be optimized for achieving its best @xmath22 has spectra and states such that the contributions to @xmath22 arise mainly from three states .",
    "this remarkable observation appears to be universal near the optimum value of @xmath22 for any system , in spite of the fact that many of the transition moments among higher states may be comparable or larger than those of the three lower states ( and thus satisfying the trk sum rules ) .",
    "moreover , the three level model parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear to scale to universal values @xmath28 and @xmath29 , independent of any structural features , when the hyperpolarizability scales to its optimum value .",
    "the final result is that the optimum potentials are those producing an energy spectrum that scales quadratically or faster with eigenenergy .",
    "this observation may explain why most molecular structures that are sampled off - resonance have nonlinearities that are well below the maximum .",
    "custom design of artificial materials may produce structures with the desired potentials .",
    "lower dimensional systems would be expected to exhibit additional enhancements due to confinement effects , as well as the change in the scaling properties of the potential .",
    "it is also desirable to examine systems with a quasi - quadratic energy spectrum but with sufficient topological variability to permit fine - tuning of the energy differences of the first few eigenstates , as well as control over the shape of the eigenstates in order to maximize the specific transition moments contributing the most to the hyperpolarizability near its optimum value .",
    "one dimensional quantum wells have too regular a spectrum to meet these requirements , but quasi - one dimensional quantum graph models often have regular root boundaries ( points between which one and only one eigenenergy can be found ) at locations resembling the spectra of a one - dimensional well but have energy spectra that may be varied within a pair of root boundaries in such a manner that energy differences and ratios may be custom - tailored by altering the topology of the graph .    for these reasons , we recently launched a study of the nonlinear optical properties of quasi - one dimensional quantum structures modeled by quantum graphs@xcite . a quantum graph ( qg )",
    "is a general confinement model for quasi - one dimensional electron dynamics .",
    "the objectives of the exploration are ( 1 ) to determine the exact dependence of the nonlinear optical response on the geometry in each of a class of graph topologies in order to understand the configurations capable of producing eigenvalues and transition moments that yield the largest first and second hyperpolarizabilities , ( 2 ) to identify universal properties of the spectra and states as the nonlinearities approach the fundamental limits , and ( 3 ) to explore the vast space of physical solutions to any hamiltonian defined on the graph that are consistent with the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rules and general principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "the generalized qg model of an @xmath30 electron structure constrains dynamics to the edges of a metric graph .",
    "our prior studies show that the one - electron version of the generalized quantum graph model ( hereafter referred to as the _ elementary qg _ ) exhibits the scaling behavior found in actual nonlinear optical systems . at the same time",
    ", multi - electron systems with arbitrary interactions yield the same universal results as one - electron systems@xcite , suggesting that the single electron models are suitable vehicles for studying the relationships of graph geometry and topology to the scaling properties of the nonlinear optical tensors .",
    "the single electron quantum graph is a well - studied , exactly solvable model of quantum chaos@xcite . with this in mind",
    ", we initiated our studies of the elementary qg model for nonlinear optics by focusing first on undressed edges and calculated the off - resonance first ( @xmath0 ) and second ( @xmath1 ) hyperpolarizability tensors ( normalized to their maximum values ) of elementary graphical structures , such as wires , closed loops , and star vertices@xcite and to investigate the relationship between the topology and geometry of a graph and its nonlinear optical response through its hyperpolarizability tensors@xcite .",
    "we also developed computational methods using graphical motifs in order to solve any graph and applied the method to topologies with several sets of star vertices@xcite .",
    "with undressed edges , we obtained nonlinear responses for both @xmath22 and @xmath24 approaching eighty percent of the fundamental limits empirically determined from potential optimization studies@xcite .",
    "the present work addresses graphs with dressed edges and discovers for the first time topologies achieving the limits obtained using 1d potential optimization .",
    "the quantum wires are dressed with finite delta potentials located anywhere on the wires .",
    "these structures are commonly called compressed delta atoms with one delta potential@xcite , and we call them compressed delta molecules with more than one delta potential .",
    "since these are quasi-1d quantum graphs , we can allow nonzero angles between the edges in order to vary graph geometry , if desired .",
    "we also dress the two star graph motifs@xcite ( the three - star and the lollipop ) with finite delta function potentials located at vertices . the presence of a delta function on a wire or at a vertex creates a source or sink for flux in the graph and provides a means for sensitive control of the nonlinearity by altering the matching of edge functions in such a way that optimum eigenfunction distribution may be achieved .",
    "the models simulate the presence of defects on intersections of quantum wires and show that the presence of such defects may provide significant enhancement of the nonlinearity .",
    "we are able to obtain nearly ninety percent of the potential - optimized upper bound of the first and second hyperpolarizabilities with a single , finite delta potential at the central vertex of a star or lollipop graph , and one hundred percent for the compressed delta atoms and molecules .",
    "this paper is presented as follows .",
    "section [ sec : standardgraphmodel ] begins with a concise summary of the standard method we developed for calculating the hyperpolarizability tensors of a large ensemble of topologically equivalent graphs whose geometry is varied in a monte carlo algorithm@xcite .",

    "section [ sec : delta3atom ] adds yet another delta function to the wire and shows that the resulting topology hits the maximum possible nonlinearity predicted by the theory of fundamental limits of nonlinear optical materials .",
    "sections [ sec : deltastar ] and [ sec : deltalollipop ] solve the two star motif graphs with a central delta potential , show how the dressed graphs achieve larger nonlinearities than the bare graphs , and show how their model parameters scale toward universal values as the geometries of the graphs achieve the form that maximizes the hyperpolarizabilities .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the key results of this paper and places them within the framework of our prior work on the elementary quantum graph model .",
    "the configurations studied in this paper are mainly linear along the x - direction of the lab frame .",
    "however , the quantum graphs are inherently two - dimensional objects , being comprised of a longitudinal dimension along the edges and a transverse dimension perpendicular to the edges@xcite . in the limit of vanishing transverse",
    "dimension , the hyperpolarizabilities depend only on the electron motion in the longitudinal direction .",
    "however , the integrity of the model , including its unitarity , require transverse contributions to satisfy the trk sum rules .",
    "this observation enables sensitive sum rule tests to verify that the calculated eigenstates of every graph are complete in hilbert space , and that the energy spectra are correct@xcite .",
    "our present work invokes our standard model of calculating nonlinearities for quantum graphs .",
    "we have used a general monte carlo method that explores a very large configuration space to discover structures with optimum nonlinearities , which has been extensively reviewed in our prior publications for undressed graphs@xcite .",
    "we start by randomly selecting vertices in 2d space , connecting them with metric edges representing a desired topology ( eg , a loop or star ) , endowing them with single - electron dynamics , and then solving for the exact eigenstates and spectra of the entire graph by first computing the edge states that are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian on each edge with the same spectrum as all other edges and then using an appropriate union operation on edge states to create an eigenstate of a hilbert space that is a direct sum of those on each edge@xcite :    @xmath31    where the notation is that of fig .",

    "terminated ends are modeled as infinite potentials , where edge functions vanish .",
    "the collection of boundary conditions , taken together , provide a set of simultaneous equations whose solution demands that the determinant of the coefficients vanishes .",
    "this produces a transcendental characteristic ( secular ) equation that provides the eigenvalues for the graph .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 and the phases @xmath34 of the edge functions are then extracted and used to construct the eigenstates through the union operation .",
    "the eigenstates are then normalized , and the set of states and energies may be used to compute the nonlinear optical properties of the graph .",
    "there are always enough boundary conditions to solve for the eigenvalues and amplitudes in a graph .",
    "let the graph have e edges , @xmath35 external vertices , @xmath36 internal vertices , and @xmath37 total vertices .",
    "each eigenfunction has two unknown amplitudes , so there are exactly 2e unknown amplitudes .",
    "we need exactly 2e boundary condition equations in order to solve for the eigenvalues and get the amplitudes , up to a normalization constant .",
    "there are exactly @xmath35 amplitude boundary condition equations on terminated ends .",

    "the sum over k of @xmath38 is equal to the total number of internal edges that are connected by these vertices , and is equal to @xmath41 .",
    "the sum of unity over all internal vertices is @xmath36 .",
    "thus , there are exactly @xmath42 total internal amplitude boundary condition equations .",
    "this yields @xmath43 total boundary condition equations , exactly the same number as the number of unknown edge amplitudes .",
    "a nontrivial solution requires the determinant of the coefficients to vanish , leading to the secular equation determining the eigenvalues of the graph , as required .",

    "the fundamental limits of the first and second hyperpolarizabilities of nonlinear optical structures first showed that all measurements to date of real materials fall well short of the limits @xcite .",
    "extensive analytical studies using monte carlo methods that employ sum rules to constrain the space of energies and transition moments have shown that the limits are exactly achieved .",
    "no known system is able to generate the maxima , though exotic hamiltonians are expected to be able to achieve this . invoking additional constraints on the energies by using specific potential functions",
    "has shown that the fundamental limits decrease by about thirty percent . prior to the work presented in this paper ,",
    "no analytical model that begins with a potential and calculates the energies and transition moments has generated the potential optimization results .",
    "this paper is the first to present such a model , dressed quasi - one dimensional elementary quantum graphs . our prior work on the relationship between the topology of a bare ( undressed ) graph and the range of its nonlinearities showed that the best achievable results were under three quarters of the potential optimization limits .",
    "that result revealed that both the two fundamental motifs , the star and the lollipop , were the best topologies for which select geometries could be found that had these responses .",
    "in contrast , the bare straight or bent wire had a much smaller response , regardless of its shape .",
    "the three star graph is topologically distinct from a wire .",
    "but the change in boundary conditions due to the addition of a prong to the wire creates a discontinuity in the edge function slopes that is similar to that obtained by inserting a @xmath134 function in a wire segment . this suggested that dressing the wire graph with a @xmath134 function would significantly increase the response of the graph .",
    "the work in this paper showed that a wire dressed with a single , finite @xmath134 potential well produces a response nearly at the fundamental limits from potential optimization . adding another @xmath134 function increases the response to the fundamental limits . adding a single @xmath134 potential at the vertex of the star or lollipop graph likewise increases the response to approach the fundamental limits .",
    "interestingly , in this case , the addition of the well increases the response but not as much as in a wire due to the constraints imposed by the multiple edges in the star or lollipop .",
    "a single wire with two @xmath134 functions offers sensitive tuning of the localization of the eigenstates to produce the best possible overlap for maximum response .",
    "studies of dressed quantum graphs have ramifications in applications and in enhancing our fundamental understanding of how geometry , topology , and control of the wavefunctions using dressing affect the interaction between light and matter .",
    "for example , delta potentials are to a good approximation a defect in a quantum wire . as such",
    ", it may be straightforward to intentionally place a defect in a quantum wire to greatly enhance its nonlinear optical response .",
    "composite materials filled with such quantum wires could lead to materials with ultra - large nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "furthermore , the tuning of the energy spectrum afforded by the strength of the defect might we usable to control the spectral response of the material to meet the requirements of a particular application .",
    "the precise control of a quantum system through the addition of defects allows a broader sampling of the configuration space to which all real systems are confined .",
    "one nagging question is the 30% gap between the limit and the largest values obtained from theoretical calculations of a large number of quantum systems .",
    "the key may lie in the three - level ansatz , which was used to derive the limits .",
    "empirical evidence supports the fact that the hyperpolarizability is always well approximated by a three - level system near a local maximum , but why has the global maximum predicted by the limits eluded all calculations and measurements ?",
    "the functions defined by equations [ eff ] and [ gee ] are assumed to be independent in the calculation of the limits , but in real systems , they may be related . as depicted in figures [ fig:1delta_spectra_beta_vs_g ] and [ fig:123delta_states_bestbetagamma ] , as the negative delta function",
    "is made stronger , the energy gap increases , yielding a favorable energy spectrum .",
    "however , as the delta function gets stronger , the ground - state wavefunction becomes more localized , so the overlap with other states is reduced , thus decreasing the nonlinearity . as such , the parameters @xmath223 and @xmath221 in real systems may not be independent .",
    "if this relationship can be quantified in the form of a constraint , it would undoubtedly be a useful tool to understand the puzzling observations .",
    "the various patterns observed in the present studies hint at a rich underlying structure that is a manifestation of the constraints imposed by nature .",
    "the present study is a first step in accumulating the needed evidence to unravel the mystery that presents itself .",
