    "the helmholtz or gibbs free energy constitutes an important thermodynamic quantity to understand how chemical species recognize each other , associate or react .",

    "thermodynamic integration ( ti ) is a commonly used approach for the calculation of free energy differences ( @xmath1 ) between two systems with potential energy functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the free energy difference , @xmath4 , is equivalent to the reversible work to switch from @xmath3 to @xmath2 , and can be determined by estimating the integral @xmath5 the notation @xmath6 indicates an ensemble average at a particular value of @xmath0 .",
    "the variable @xmath0 permits continuously switching from one energy function to another . switching potential energies requires a continuously variable energy function @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the free energy function @xmath7 must be differentiable with respect to @xmath0 for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the relationship in equation [ equ : integral ] is exact .",
    "the numerical estimation comes into play because the integral must be approximated by performing simulations at various fixed , discrete , values of @xmath0 .",
    "typically , these discrete @xmath0 values are used to convert the integral to a sum ( e.g. , using quadrature ) .",
    "if the estimate of @xmath11 is slow to converge , then it is necessary to perform very long simulations in order reliably estimate the average .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 may heavily depend on @xmath0 so that a large number of fixed @xmath0 simulations is needed in order to estimate the integral with sufficient accuracy .    previously , shyu and ytreberg @xcite reported the use of regression techniques to calculate the free energy from ti data . using analytical solvable examples ,",
    "the authors were able to achieve highly accurate estimates .",
    "we note that regression does not produce a curve that goes through every data point exactly .",
    "instead the regression model only describes the tendency of the data and does not represent the functional form .",
    "the purpose of this current study is to introduce polynomial and spline interpolation techniques to estimate @xmath1 and to use both interpolation and regression methods to estimate a small molecule solvation free energy .",
    "this differs from our previous study in that these polynomials interpolate the slope of the free energy @xmath13 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the derived curve is forced to pass through each data point .",
    "regression , by contrast , constructs the curve that minimizes the errors between the data and extrapolated points .",
    "the key motivation for this study is that , even if the averages @xmath6 are fully converged ( i.e. , infinitely long sampling ) , there will be error in the @xmath1 estimates due to the fact that one must estimate the integral . here",
    "we present methods which reduce this error and construct the polynomial that represents the functional form of ti data .",
    "we also examine the use of both equidistant and non - equidistant @xmath0 values .",
    "two test systems previously used by shyu and ytreberg @xcite with analytical @xmath1 values were utilized to quantify the accuracy and precision of the interpolation techniques .",
    "we also used both regression and interpolation techniques to estimate a small molecule solvation free energy .",
    "the results from our simulations suggest that polynomial fitting , especially with use of non - equidistant @xmath0 values , improves the accuracy and precision for @xmath1 estimates without demanding additional simulations .",
    "in addition , polynomial fitting techniques permit accurate estimates of free energy difference from ti without the need for soft - core scaling and separate simulations for partial charges and lennard - jones potentials .",
    "the primary focus of this study is to present a mathematical framework for the analysis of fixed ti simulation data using polynomial and spline interpolation techniques .",
    "the objective is then to construct a polynomial that best fits the ti data .",
    "the functional form of the simulation data is represented by a series of data points @xmath14 , thus a polynomial is constructed through these data .",

    "polynomial interpolation and regression techniques generally give a similar result , especially when high degrees of polynomials are employed to fit the ti data .",
    "however , the curve obtained from polynomial interpolation passes though each data point whereas the curved generated via regression does not . if ti simulations are fully converged ( i.e. , infinite sampling ) , then polynomial interpolation should give the most accurate and precise estimate .",
    "regression , on the other hand , utilizes the least squares method that minimizes the sum of the square of the difference between the actual value and the approximated one .",
    "regression does have an advantage over interpolation in that the approximation is independent of the number of data points .",
    "however , we note that regression may not give the best estimates if the ti data include several inflection points due to the fact that regression does not attempt to construct a curve that passes through every data point .      to simplify the mathematical expressions and to be consistent with the most commonly used notation in polynomial and spline interpolation papers , we denote the switching variable @xmath0 by @xmath16 , and , @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "we also denote the actual continuous function @xmath17 by @xmath19 .",

    "the most straightforward method to obtain the polynomial @xmath22 of degree @xmath25 is to calculate the values of @xmath19 for @xmath26 distinct fitting data points within the interval of @xmath27 , and satisfy the simultaneous equation @xmath28 , for @xmath29 .",
    "lagrange and newton polynomials are the most commonly used methods for interpolation @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the above polynomial @xmath22 then form the basis of the lagrange interpolation formula .",
    "the weierstrass theorem contends that there is always a unique polynomial @xmath22 of degree @xmath25 that satisfies these conditions .",
    "the lagrange interpolation polynomial @xmath30 is a linear combination of lagrange basis polynomials @xmath31 such that @xmath32.\\ ] ] it is worth noting that the degree of polynomial @xmath25 can not be chosen arbitrarily but is determined by the number of data points @xmath26 .",
    "this is important since the degree of interpolating polynomials will thus be determined by the number of @xmath0 values used to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "mathematically , the lagrange form of the interpolation polynomial is generally preferred in proof and theoretical arguments because the derivatives of the polynomial are continuous , and maxima or minima always exist @xcite .",
    "the construction of lagrange polynomials , however , is computationally demanding because all lagrange basis polynomials have to be reevaluated each time @xmath33 is updated .",
    "by contrast , newton interpolation utilizes the divided difference ( more on this below ) which is generally more computationally efficient @xcite .    a more practical form of interpolation polynomial for computational purposes is given by newton polynomials that utilize the divided difference .",
    "the divided difference is defined as the ratio of the difference in the function values , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , at two points divided by the difference in the values of the corresponding independent variable , @xmath35 .",

    "computationally , the divided differences can be written in the form of a table that significantly simplifies the algorithmic implementation @xcite .",
    "studies have suggested that the spline function is typically preferred over polynomials because the interpolation error can be reduced by using low degrees of polynomials @xcite .",
    "spline interpolation also avoids the runge s phenomenon which occurs when using high degree polynomials @xcite .",
    "runge s phenomenon is when approximation errors increase dramatically as the degree of interpolation polynomials increases .",
    "spline functions are piecewise polynomials of the same degree @xcite .",
    "unlike the lagrange and newton interpolation polynomials , the degree of the piecewise polynomials does not depend on the number of data points .",
    "the piecewise polynomials join together at the data points @xmath46 called knots and must be continuous @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of spline interpolation are stability and simplicity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the use of polynomials of lower degree offers the possibility to avoid the oscillatory behavior that commonly arises from fitting a single polynomial exactly to a large number of data points @xcite .",
    "we utilize the cubic spline which is the most commonly used type .",
    "a cubic spline function is a set of third degree piecewise polynomials that provide a smooth curve passing through all data points . because the segments join with matching derivatives up to order two , the curvature of the polynomials changes smoothly along the knots .",
    "the fundamental idea behind cubic spline interpolation is based on the engineer s tool used to draw smooth curves through a number of points .",
    "this spline consists of weights attached to a flat surface at the points to be connected .",
    "a flexible strip is then bent across each of these weights , resulting in a smooth curve .",

    "there are two boundary condition types which could be utilized .",
    "the natural cubic spline imposes the boundary conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the clamped cubic spline requires @xmath60 and @xmath61 for a given function @xcite .",
    "when the natural boundary conditions are used , the spline assumes the shape that a long flexible curve would take if it is forced to go through all the data points .",
    "a natural spline permits the slope at the ends be free to equilibrate to the position that minimizes the oscillatory behavior of the curve . a clamped cubic spline , on the other hand , further requires a piecewise cubic function which passes through the given set of knots with a given function or value .",
    "the derivatives and second derivatives of adjacent cubic polynomials must also agree at the interior abscissae .",
    "it is worth noting that spline interpolation polynomials are piecewise and do not always approximate the @xmath17 completely .",

    "our study utilized two test systems with analytical @xmath1 values to objectively quantify the accuracy and precision of the interpolation techniques .",
    "we also used both interpolation and regression to estimate the solvation free energy for buq .",
    "these polynomial approaches rely on constructing globally optimal polynomials that best fit the ti data , which are then used to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "additional algebraic calculations are done to permit analytical integration eliminating potential errors due to numerical evaluation on the integral .",
    "studies have shown that the use of soft - core scaling improves the accuracy of @xmath1 estimates within @xmath102 kj / mol for alchemical ti simulations @xcite .",
    "our simulations , however , suggest that similar accuracy can also be achieved using non - equidistant @xmath0 and polynomial interpolation or regression techniques without soft - core scaling .",
    "we have shown that polynomial and spline interpolation techniques provide more accurate and precise @xmath1 estimates than trapezoidal quadrature for the systems studied here . however , we caution that polynomial interpolation techniques possess some inherent weakness .",
    "the most significant is that use of more than eleven @xmath0 produces interpolation polynomials that are numerically unstable . as a consequence ,",
    "our approach is limited to use of eleven or less equidistant or non - equidistant @xmath0 values or one may judicially select subsets of the @xmath0 data that best represent the underlying functional form of the free energy curve .",
    "our results also illustrate the importance of selection of @xmath0 values if one wishes to use polynomial interpolation techniques to improve the accuracy of @xmath1 estimates . for the systems studied here , use of non - equidistant @xmath0 always produced more accurate @xmath1 estimates than use of equidistant @xmath0 . using twelve or less @xmath0 values the lagrange and newton polynomials always produced the highest accuracy .",
    "the @xmath1 estimates via cubic spline were more accurate than quadrature but less accurate than lagrange and newton .",
    "we note that for data containing more twelve @xmath0 values , cubic spline is expected to produce more accurate results than lagrange and newton because of superior numerical stability .    to better facilitate the use of polynomial fitting techniques , we propose several guidelines for estimating @xmath1 .",
    "researchers who already have very well converged ti data with eleven or less @xmath0 values are encouraged to utilize the lagrange or newton polynomial interpolation approach . for researchers who already have data from equilibrium simulations with twelve or more @xmath0 values , the spline interpolation technique should be used instead .",
    "researchers that have not yet generated data are strongly encouraged to use non - equidistant @xmath0 values and polynomial fitting techniques .",
    "finally , if the ti data is noisy or not very well converged then regression @xcite should be used instead of interpolation . to allow researchers to immediately utilize these methods , free software and documentation",
