    "ambient vibration monitoring ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) has now become widely accepted as an important tool for structural health monitoring ( shm ) . but",
    "structural vibrations are affected by prestress states .",
    "in particular , thermal variations may cause very significant changes in a bridge spectrum @xcite . since temperature effects may be orders of magnitude larger than the effect of a damage , overlooking them prevents from a reliable damage detection based on vibration monitoring .",
    "most attempts to eliminate thermal effects have favoured blind approaches not taking advantage of predictive models @xcite",
    ". however , successful endeavours to eliminate the temperature from subspace - based damage detection algorithms prove the relevance of relying on predictive thermomechanical models yielding the prestress state due to temperature @xcite .",
    "this suggests to deeper understand the way temperature interacts with structural dynamics and to revisit associated models .",
    "this paper steps forward in this direction .    on the other hand , identification of the geometrically non - linear behaviour of beams or plates has recently given rise to numerous papers ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , often using the notion of non - linear modes @xcite @xcite .",
    "non - linear dynamics of prestressed beams or plates undergoing small strains and moderate rotations is simulated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ". however , the dynamics used in these contributions seems to be based on some `` historical '' assumptions , whose justification is often skipped .",
    "the purpose of this paper is then to provide a new viewpoint on this classical subject , where a very large number of contributions , sometimes not clearly related , have been superposed over the years .",
    "we make clear the series of simplifying assumptions leading from the 3d continuous thermo - elasticity theory to the equations governing the dynamics of thin structures with prestress and thermal field , under the assumption of `` small strains and moderate rotations '' .",
    "attention is paid to the definition of the range of validity of these classical equations , introducing the notion of strain - rotation domains .",
    "more precisely : @xmath0 a hu - washizu functional including suitable stress constraints and the associated lagrange multipliers is defined : the constitutive law , the strain - displacement relationship as well as the dynamic equilibrium equations are then derived by imposing the stationarity conditions .",
    "stress constraints characterizing thin body theories are introduced in the 3d models in view of a convenient derivation of 1d beam models . @xmath1 the most important configurations characterizing the structural behaviour are clearly identified .",
    "@xmath2 the assumption that the _  prestressed _ configuration has a known geometry , adopted as _ lagrangian reference _ configuration ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , is removed .",
    "when the pre - stress field and the original geometry of the structure are very simple , this hypothesis is convenient .",
    "however , for more general conditions , _",
    "e.g. _ when the prestress state is time - dependent or related to a general thermal field , this assumption appears to be over - simplified .",
    "hence , a different analysis , where prestressed and lagrangian reference configurations are _ distinct _ , seems to be more suitable .",
    "the equilibrium equation governing the dynamics of a structure subjected to a generic prestress is defined as the _ difference _ between the lagrangian equations at the dynamic configuration and at the statically prestressed configuration .",
    "@xmath3 a rigorous formalization of the assumption of `` small strain and moderate rotations '' is provided . to this end , measures of the strain amplitude ( symmetric part of the displacement gradient ) and of the rotations ( skew - symmetric part ) are introduced in the 3d continuous framework , whereas standard approaches use the aspect ratio as the governing parameter ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the new solution - dependent measures enables one to define strain - rotation domains in which the leading terms of the strain energy are clearly identified .",
    "damping , due to internal friction or other dissipative phenomena , should carefully be taken into account in the structural analysis .",
    "several damping models exist , like general linear damping or viscous proportional or non - proportional linear damping ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "however , the link between these structural damping models and the corresponding dissipative material behaviour , described by a given strain - stress law , does not seem to be clearly established in the literature . here the beam dynamic equations with linear viscous damping are derived for the case of `` small strains and moderate rotations '' , thus filling the gap .",
    "the different configurations characterizing a vibrating structure subjected to static and dynamic loads and to a thermal field are defined in section 2 .",
    "then , the thermo - elastic constitutive rule is presented in section 3 .",
    "physical linearization is considered .",
    "section 4 introduces a modified hu - washizu functional accounting for stress constraints .",
    "the corresponding stationarity conditions are discussed . in section 5 , two global measures for the strains and the rotations are introduced and used to suggest approximated expressions of the strain energy , each approximation being valid in a strain - rotation domain .",
    "2d finite element simulations substantiate the approximation of the strain energy .",
    "section 6 introduces a dissipative stress tensor in view of modelling damping effect .",
    "section 7 leads to a general expression of the weak equilibrium of a continuum subjected to a general static prestress . in section 8 the previous general procedure",
    "is used to derive the euler - bernoulli beam equations for small strains and moderate rotations in the undamped case , while the damped case is treated in section 9 .",
    "after the conclusions , the appendix explains how to compute the lagrange multipliers .",
