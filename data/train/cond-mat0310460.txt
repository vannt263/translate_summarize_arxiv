    "for a bose gas of @xmath7 atoms contained in a trap at a given temperature , bose - einstein condensation first sets in at the point where the density is maximum .",
    "repulsive interactions tend to make the density more uniform , and hence will in general lower the density at this point , so that they will decrease the transition temperature with respect to an ideal gas .",
    "several authors have studied this effect ; for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite (   v - b ) and references therein .  here , for the sake of simplicity , we limit ourselves to the discussion of isotropic traps and to the thermodynamic limit of particles tends to infinity , the frequency @xmath8 of the trap goes to zero , and the product @xmath9 remains constant . ] .",
    "this excludes finite size effects , which are also discussed in @xcite ; a finite size system does not undergo a sharp phase transition and thus the critical temperature , and its shift , depend on a somewhat arbitrary definition of the critical temperature[multiblock footnote omitted ] . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", this arbitrary character disappears ; the width of the trap becomes large so that the effects of the trapping potential may be treated within a semi - classical approximation .  around the center of the trap",
    ", one can then completely ignore the effects of the potential , and the condensation is obtained when , locally , the critical conditions are reached .",
    "this happens when the local degeneracy parameter , the product @xmath10 , is equal to the critical value of this parameter in a homogeneous system , where @xmath11 is the number density at the center of the trap and @xmath12 the thermal wavelength .",
    "for an ideal gas , this value is @xmath13 ; for an non ideal gas , it is slightly shifted , see   [ correlation ] .",
    "the question now is to relate @xmath11 to @xmath7 in order to obtain its critical value as a function of the temperature , or conversely the critical temperature as a function of @xmath7 .      in a gas in equilibrium , the local density of the gas adjusts locally so that the pressure gradient in the gas compensates exactly for the force exerted by the external potential .",
    "the equation of state of the gas therefore plays an essential role in the determination of the density profile in a trap . a good approximation is provided by mean field theory , where the local density of the gas is written as:@xmath14 + n_{0 } \\label{1}%\\ ] ] with:@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inverse temperature , @xmath17 the usual bose function @xcite and @xmath18 the density of condensed particles .",
    "figure 1-a shows the variations of the density of the chemical potential , the curve should not have a kink , but a continuous slope . ] as a function of the chemical potential @xmath19 , assuming that the gas is repulsive ( @xmath20 ) - see for instance figure 10 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a geometrical construction of this curve .",
    "integration over the chemical potential provides the pressure ( fig .",
    "1-b ) ; eliminating @xmath21 leads to the equation of state in mean field approximation ( fig .",
    "1-c ) . for comparison ,",
    "the curves are also shown for the ideal gas ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "as expected , repulsive interactions tend to increase the pressure of the gas and to reduce its compressibility .      in a trap that is sufficiently large ( thermodynamic limit )",
    ", the effects of the external potential can be treated semi - classically , which allows one to extend equations ( [ 1],[2 ] ) to inhomogeneous systems .",
    "we now assume that the gas is not bose condensed and define the effective chemical potential @xmath22 by:@xmath23 and find:@xmath24   \\label{3 - 1}%\\ ] ] but equation ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) can be inverted as:@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the logarithm of the inverse function of @xmath27 . by differentiation , one obtains:@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the derivative of @xmath26 . combined with ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) , this equation yields:@xmath30   ~\\bigtriangledown n(\\mathbf{r } ) \\label{4}%\\ ] ] which relates the local variations of the potential and of the density .",
    "in general , the term in @xmath31 on the right side of this equation is a small correction to the term in @xmath32 , so that the relation between the two gradients depends only weakly on @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , in regions of space where the gas is almost condensed , the derivative @xmath29 becomes very small and , for a given @xmath33 , the density gradient @xmath34 becomes much larger and strongly @xmath1 dependent ; this phenomenon can take place at the center of the trap , as we discuss in more detail in ",
    "[ combined ] .",
    "equation ( [ 4 ] ) allows one to calculate @xmath35 at every point of the gas as a function of @xmath11 and , through an @xmath36 integration , of the total number of particles @xmath7 .  at the critical point , @xmath11 is fixed by the condition @xmath10",
    "@xmath37  in the mean field approximation , and therefore have no @xmath38 dependence .  in this case , one can easily show @xcite@xcite that , within mean field approximation , the critical value of the degeneracy parameter is unaffected by the interactions .",
    "] , so that this calculation provides a relation between the critical values of @xmath7 and @xmath39 . for a harmonic trap , where the size of the single particle ground state is @xmath40 , giorgini et al .",
    "@xcite show that , to lowest order , this critical temperature is shifted with respect to its ideal gas value @xmath41 by an amount @xmath42 given by:@xmath43 since @xmath44 , the relative change of temperature remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "significant critical temperature shifts can indeed be observed experimentally ; for instance , recent experiments by gerbier et al .",
    "@xcite have reported observations of relative shifts as large as 10% in a rb gas , in good agreement with ( [ 5 ] ) ; early monte carlo calculations on a trapped bose gas also predicted a temperature shift dominated by the mean field @xcite @xcite .",
    "a few remarks may be useful at this stage :    \\(i ) the shift @xmath42 describes the case where the total number of atoms @xmath7 is kept constant ; if , instead , the density of the gas at the center of the trap were kept constant , the shift would vanish ( within mean field theory ) .  within a factor ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath11 are conjugate variables where @xmath45 is the partition function with the usual notation @xmath46 . ] , the former extensive , the latter intensive , somewhat similar to energy and temperature in thermodynamics .",
    "neither of them is measured directly in experiments , since optical measurements provide the column density  ( density integrated along the line of sight ) , an intermediate physical quantity .",
    "conceptually , there is nevertheless a preference for using @xmath11 as the relevant variable : while the calculation of the shift @xmath42 at constant @xmath7 @xmath47gives different results for all possible forms of traps ( parabolic , quartic , or even more complicated as that shown schematically in figure 2 ) , in the thermodynamic limit , all lead to the same value of @xmath11 ; this result is clearly more universal .",
    "\\(ii ) the physics involved in @xmath42 is only remotely related to the physics of the bose - einstein transition ; it is more closely associated with the effects of interactions on the density profile in trap , which is in turn determined by the equation of state . in other words , the calculation of @xmath7 involves many atoms which play actually no role in the condensation , because they are in regions of space where the density is too low , almost or completely in a classical regime .",
    "this is particularly obvious for the trap of figure 2  where , clearly , all the atoms in the external part of the trap are counted in @xmath7 , with a weight proportional to the volume of this part , while they play no role whatsoever in the condensation phenomenon .",
    "we now come to the central part of this article and discuss another shift of the critical temperature of totally different physical origin .",
    "this effect is not related to an external trapping potential but emerges from correlations between the particles ; it is actually most conveniently calculated for a uniform gas contained in a box . as recalled in the introduction",
    ", the study of this shift has a long history of contradictory results , predicting either an increase or a decrease of the critical temperature , as well as variations with different powers of @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is now understood that correlation effects taking place in the non condensed gas just above transition lead to an increase of the critical temperature @xmath48 , which is proportional to @xmath1 in leading order:@xmath49 where @xmath50 is a numerical positive coefficient . in @xcite , linearity emerges as an exact result from a scaling analysis of the complete perturbation series .    in this text",
    ", we give another version of the argument leading to this linearity , with more emphasis on simple properties of non - linear self - consistent equations , and on the physical mechanism they contain .  behind the increase of @xmath48",
    "is a modification of the effective energies that determine the populations of the particles with low momenta . within the framework of the non - linear self - consistent equations introduced in @xcite , and without elaborate calculations",
    ", we summarize the basic ideas that lead to the shift of the transition temperature , and comment on various points involved .      in a non condensed gas , the diagonal elements @xmath51 of the single particle density matrix can be written as:@xmath52   ^{-1 } \\label{6}%\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the inverse temperature , @xmath21 the chemical potential and the effective energy is the sum of the free particle kinetic energy @xmath54 and the energy shift @xmath55 introduced by the interactions . as in @xcite , we write[multiblock footnote omitted ] : @xmath56 this equation is not exact , but a self - consistent one bubble approximation  to @xmath57 ; it nevertheless allows a qualitative discussion of the properties of the more general theory and provides a reasonable estimate of the leading correction for @xmath58 in the homogeneous system .",
    "the first term on the right side of ( [ 7 ] ) is simply the mean field term ; in the low temperature regime where the interactions are described in terms of the scattering length @xmath1 only , it depends only on the density : @xmath59 because this mean field is independent of @xmath38 , it has no effect whatsoever on the critical density ( at a given temperature ) .",
    "the second term is more interesting ; it corresponds to the effect of correlations due to interactions in the gas , and introduces a @xmath38 dependence of the energy shift @xmath57 .",
    "we will see that this shift tends to harden  the free particle spectrum around @xmath60    the condition for bose - einstein condensation reads : @xmath61 so that , in terms of the spectrum  at the critical point:@xmath62   \\label{w}%\\ ] ] eqs ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) provide the following self - consistent equation : @xmath63{ll}% w(\\mathbf{k } ) & \\displaystyle=\\beta e_{\\mathbf{k}}-8\\left (   \\frac{a}{\\lambda } \\right )   ^{2}\\left (   \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\right )   ^{6}\\int d^{3}k^{^{\\prime}% } \\int d^{3}q\\\\ & \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{e^{w(\\mathbf{k}^{^{\\prime}})}-1}~\\frac{1}% { e^{w(\\mathbf{k}^{^{\\prime}}-\\mathbf{q})}-1}\\left [   \\frac{1}{e^{w(\\mathbf{k}% + \\mathbf{q})}-1}-\\frac{1}{e^{w(\\mathbf{q})}-1}\\right ] \\end{array } \\label{8 - 3}%\\ ] ] from the spectrum we can obtain the populations @xmath64 and the critical density @xmath65 .  actually , what we wish to obtain is the change @xmath66 of the critical density ( at constant temperature ) with respect to the ideal gas value @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that only small values of @xmath38 contribute to this change ( we discuss why this is true below ) ; since @xmath68 vanishes , we can replace @xmath69   ^{-1}$ ] by @xmath70 to obtain : @xmath71 \\label{nc}%\\ ] ] to leading order .",
    "note that , as mentioned above , the mean - field term does not enter the problem anymore , and therefore does not influence the critical density or temperature .    at this point , it is easy to convert the change of density ( [ nc ] ) at constant temperature into a change of temperature at constant density .",
    "the critical condition in the presence of interactions can be written as:@xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ g ] ) defines the new critical line in the temperature - density plane ( fig .",
    "any point on the initial critical line ( ideal gas ) can be moved by a first order change of either the density , or the temperature , and reach a point on the new critical line ; the only condition is that the change of the product @xmath74 should be equal to @xmath75 to first order and @xmath73 . ] .",
    "but the same change of @xmath74 can be obtained , either when @xmath76 with a change of temperature @xmath77 , or when @xmath78 with a change of density @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , for any motion in the temperature - density plane , the relative variation of the left side of ( [ g ] ) is given by:@xmath80 the same relative variation can therefore be obtained , either with a relative change @xmath81 at constant @xmath39 , or with a relative change @xmath82  at constant density , provided the ratio between the two changes is @xmath83 .",
    "finally , the leading term of the change of critical temperature @xmath84 is given by:@xmath85",
    "\\label{tc-2}%\\ ] ]    we will see in   [ scl ] that the change of the spectrum at the critical point manifests itself primarily in a small @xmath0 region centered at the origin and of width @xmath86 given by:@xmath87 in this region , the correction @xmath88 is comparable to the free particle energy @xmath89 , or may even dominate in @xmath90 ; this property is also discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the change of energy is simple : the atoms with very low velocities are extremely sensitive to even very small effects of the interaction potential .",
    "they can therefore rearrange themselves in space to minimize their repulsive energy , reaching a smaller value than the mean field prediction .  on the other hand , the atoms with higher @xmath0 values than @xmath86 have too much kinetic energy to do so .",
    "this rearranging process can be regarded as an analogue , in terms of interaction potential and correlations , of the effect of a weak external potential on particle positions discussed by lamb et al .",
    "these authors point out that the character of the bose - einstein condensation is qualitatively modified even by a weak external potential , transferring it from momentum space to real space .",
    "here we have another illustration of the extreme sensitivity of a gas just above transition to any potential , but in the space of relative positions instead of ordinary position of the particles .",
    "the non - linear equations ( [ 6],[7 ] ) , or ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) , are not easy to solve .",
    "one can start by assuming that @xmath57 provides only a small correction to the free particle spectrum , so that the right side of ( [ 7 ] ) can be calculated with @xmath91 , which provides a first approximation for @xmath57 - this operation can be regarded as a first iteration of an infinite process leading to a fully self - consistent solution .",
    "the critical condition ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) then gives an implicit equation in @xmath21 to determine the critical value of the chemical potential ( still within this first iteration ) .",
    "for this value of @xmath21 , one can then use ( [ 6 ] ) to calculate the new populations @xmath64 , and finally @xmath92 by integration over @xmath0 .",
    "this is precisely what was done in @xcite for values of @xmath93 ranging from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , leading to the following value of the coefficient @xmath50 ( obtained by dividing the relative change of @xmath48 by @xmath96 ) : @xmath97    one can of course also make two ( or more ) iterations : again choose @xmath21 , calculate the first approximation for @xmath57 , the first approximation for @xmath64 , inject them into  ( [ 7 ] ) to obtain the second approximation for @xmath57 , and then only determine @xmath21 by the condensation condition .",
    "the second approximation for @xmath64 eventually provides the critical density by integration over @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure leads to a progressive hardening of the spectrum , as illustrated by fig .",
    "15 of @xcite , and typically to higher values of @xmath50 than suggested by the first iteration approximation , eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "but what is the validity of these calculations ?  knowing that the presently accepted value is @xmath98 @xcite , at first sight one could consider this calculation a success , especially in view of its simplicity",
    ".  however , success may be pure coincidence !",
    "in fact , an analytical study of the single iteration procedure shows that it does not lead to a linear dependence of @xmath84 in @xmath1 , but actually contains spurious logarithms in @xmath1 ; these logarithms will dominate in the limit @xmath99 and destroy the linearity - we come back to this point in   [ ir ] , but see also   5.1 of @xcite .",
    "in other words , if the numerical calculations leading to ( [ 10 ] ) had been made with a different range for the parameter @xmath93 , a different value for the coefficient @xmath50 would have been obtained , as illustrated by the table of   5.1 in @xcite .",
    "the validity of the first iteration leading to eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is therefore difficult to assess a priori ; see @xcite for another example of a calculation which predicts a non - linear leading correction , an @xmath100 in this particular case .",
    "we now come back to the full equation ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) and discuss the properties of the self - consistent solution @xmath90 .",
    "we define the dimensionless function @xmath101 of the dimensionless variable @xmath102 by : @xmath103 inserting this into ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) provides : @xmath104   \\label{self - dim0}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we take the limit @xmath105 of the integrand on the right side of this equation ( an operation justified below ) , we obtain the parameter - free self - consistent equation : @xmath106 \\label{self - dim}%\\ ] ] ( one can easily check that no other choice for the powers of @xmath1 and @xmath107 in the scaling factors of ( [ essai ] ) would allow the same complete disappearance of all parameters from the equation ) .",
    "we now assume the existence of a solution to ( [ self - dim ] ) that , for values of @xmath108 , is dominated by the free spectrum term @xmath109 .",
    "we note that the integral is made ultraviolet ( uv ) convergent by the difference that appears in the brackets .",
    "as for infrared ( ir ) convergence , for small @xmath110 s the self - consistent solution will automatically have a harder variation than @xmath111 ( free spectrum ) in order to make the integral convergent , a variation in @xmath112 for instance ) predicts a @xmath112 dependence of @xmath101 for small values of @xmath110 .",
    "] @xcite .",
    "being convergent , the value of the integral can be obtained with arbitrary accuracy from a finite domain of the dimensionless variable @xmath110 , corresponding to @xmath113 ( where @xmath114 is a pure number ) .",
    "coming back to ( [ self - dim0 ] ) , we see that the exponent in the denominator is smaller or equal to @xmath115 , which tends to zero when @xmath116 ( since @xmath117 is a pure number , independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this , in retrospect , justifies the lowest order expansion of the exponentials inside the integrand which led us to ( [ self - dim ] ) , at least for values of the current variable @xmath110 which are not too large ( see below ) .    finally , inserting ( [ essai ] ) into ( [ nc ] ) provides:@xmath118 or , with a variable change @xmath102:@xmath119",
    "this result is equivalent to ( [ nc ] ) and shows that the density shift at constant temperature is indeed linear in @xmath1 ; consequently , the same property is true for the temperature shift at constant density .",
    "the values of the dimensionless variable @xmath110 that contribute to the integral are smaller or comparable to @xmath114 .  in terms of the initial momentum variables appearing in ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) , this domain has a range given by some number multiplying @xmath120 defined in ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "going from ( [ self - dim0 ] ) to ( [ self - dim ] ) actually also requires that the current variable @xmath110 not be too large , namely that @xmath121 . since",
    ", for large @xmath110 , @xmath101 is dominated by the kinetic energy term @xmath122 , this condition corresponds to @xmath123 and therefore to @xmath124 . in other words , the values of @xmath57 obtained from ( [ self - dim ] ) are correct , but only for momenta significantly smaller that the maximum thermal momentum .",
    "this caveat is irrelevant for the calculation of the leading term of the density shift .  as we will see in more detail in",
    "  [ spectrum ] , what is important is the crossover value of @xmath0 at which the function @xmath101 switches from a behavior dominated by the integral to a behavior dominated by the quadratic kinetic energy .  from ( [ self - dim ] )",
    ", we know that this phenomenon takes place for some finite value of @xmath125 which corresponds , in terms of @xmath0 , to a multiple of @xmath120 . finally , it is easy to see in ( [ 9 ] ) that , for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 , the product @xmath126 remains much smaller than @xmath127 , which means that only particles with low momentum have a role in the change of critical density .",
    "the conclusion is that the non - linear self - consistent equation for the effective energies leads to linear @xmath1 dependences of the temperature shift , but only if it is treated self - consistently ; otherwise , more complicated spurious variations are introduced - see also ref .",
    "@xcite for other numerical illustrations of this property .",
    "we now go beyond the simple approximation ( [ 7 ] ) for the effective energy and generalize the considerations of the preceding section . in the complete theory @xcite ,",
    "the right side of this equation contains an infinite sum of integrals , corresponding to all diagrams in the theory .",
    "they start from the second order term in @xmath93 already contained in ( [ 7 ] ) , and continue with terms of all orders in @xmath93 , containing higher dimensional integrals with more elaborate structure .",
    "the problem then becomes significantly more complicated ; we will see , nevertheless , that most of the conclusions of the preceding section remain valid .",
    "we first discuss the general relation between infrared convergence of the theory and the linearity in @xmath1 of the leading term in the correction , then show that the linearity of the simple model remains valid within the general theory , and finally emphasize the difficulties arising in the precise calculation of the linear coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "it is well known that the perturbative treatment of second order phase transitions gives rise to infrared ( ir )  divergences . here",
    ", we discuss the close relation between these divergences and a possible breakdown of the linearity in @xmath1 of the critical temperature shift .",
    "let us first come back to the single iteration approximation discussed in ",
    "[ spurious ] .",
    "if we introduce again the effective chemical potential @xmath128 ,  we see that this approximation involves integrals - right side of ( [ 7 ] ) - which , because they contain the ideal gas spectrum @xmath129 , are ir  divergent if @xmath130 .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath131 , one obtains @xmath132 , so that the critical condition ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) leads to logarithms in the value of the critical chemical potential , @xmath133 .  but , for small @xmath0 , the integrand can be written as:@xmath134   ^{-1}=\\beta^{-1}\\left [ \\left (   \\hbar^{2}k^{2}/2m\\right )   -\\mu_{\\text{eff}}\\right ]   ^{-1}\\sim\\left [ \\left (   k\\zeta\\right )   ^{2}+1\\right ]   ^{-1 } \\label{fraction}%\\ ] ] where the mean field correlation length @xmath135 is defined by @xmath136 , as in refs .",
    "we then see that @xmath135 plays the role of a scaling factor for the @xmath0 dependence of the energies : @xmath137 where @xmath101 is a dimensionless function .",
    "we can finally use this result to calculate the critical density shift , eq .",
    "( [ nc ] ) , and obtain @xmath138 , which is proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "for extremely small values of @xmath1 , the logarithmic dependence on @xmath1 of the correlation length then dominates the shift of the critical temperature .",
    "this explains why the table of @xcite gives values of @xmath50 that depend slightly on the ratio @xmath93 .",
    "nevertheless , this logarithmic scaling is spurious , an artifact of the truncation of the self - consistent equations at the first iteration ; as we have seen in ",
    "[ scl ] , the complete self - consistent solution leads to a shift of @xmath48 linear in @xmath1 .    more generally , the relation between ir convergence and linearity is easy to understand .",
    "the critical condition ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) is the key to the calculation of the scaling factor @xmath140 at the critical point , which in turn determines the critical density . since",
    "@xmath141 can be written as:@xmath142 where @xmath143 is a positive integral depending on the chemical potential through @xmath135 , the critical condition ( [ 8 - 2 ] ) reads : @xmath144 graphically , as shown in figure 4 , the critical value of @xmath145 is obtained by intersecting a straight line with large slope @xmath146 with the function @xmath147 , considered as a function of @xmath145 .  the intersection point is close to the vertical axis .",
    "if @xmath148 has a finite limit @xmath149 when @xmath150 , we immediately obtain @xmath151 , and from this simple scaling factor linearity in @xmath1 follows .  on the other hand , if this function diverges when @xmath150 , the scaling factor has a more complicated @xmath1 dependence .    ref .",
    "@xcite discusses various models illustrating the relation between the absence of ir  divergences and the linearity in @xmath1 of the leading term in the correction .",
    "for instance , the bubble sum , or the ladder sum , both contain integrands with fractions that automatically control the divergences , and therefore lead to linear dependences of the density shift in @xmath1 .",
    "this property explains why ref .",
    "@xcite predicts a linear @xmath1 dependence , in an approach based on the many body @xmath39 matrix approximation , similar to a ladder sum approximation .",
    "clearly , these results do not establish the linearity in @xmath1 for the full theory , since there is no special reason why only bubbles or ladder should be retained from the full series .",
    "the disappearance of the ir divergences from the bubble or ladder sums is a special property of these subseries .  for the reasons discussed above",
    ", one could expect the density corrections to be dominated by other diagrams containing ir  divergences , therefore providing a result in @xmath152 for instance ( this is indeed the result obtained later in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and making the contribution of isolated ladders negligible .",
    "we now discuss the full theory to examine why the linearity in @xmath1 is actually preserved .",
    "the reasoning of   [ scl ] can be extended to the more complicated structure of the effective energies in the complete theory .",
    "we refer the reader to the discussion given in   4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ; here , we give only a brief discussion of the argument leading to linearity .",
    "the various terms in @xmath57 , corresponding to a series of diagrams with increasing powers of @xmath93 , may be obtained by recurrence from one order to the next . at each step ,",
    "one includes one more power of @xmath93 , one more @xmath38 integral with a factor @xmath153 , and two more @xmath64 s , introducing two fractions with exponentials of @xmath90 in the denominator .",
    "now , if we make the same change of variable @xmath102 as before , we see that the change of integration variable introduces an additional factor @xmath154 , which comes in addition to an @xmath155 from the two coefficients above ; altogether , we get precisely the factor @xmath156 that is necessary to add a factor @xmath157 to the numerator of each fraction , exactly as in ( [ self - dim0 ] ) .  as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain again a parameter free non - linear equation , generalizing ( [ self - dim ] ) .",
    "this new integral is more ultraviolet convergent than in the right side of ( [ self - dim ] ) since , for large @xmath110 , two additional factors of @xmath111 overcompensate the additional integration factor @xmath158 .  as for ir convergence ,",
    "again it is obtained because the solution @xmath101 has to adapt its small @xmath110 behavior to ensure it .",
    "finally , the reasoning of   [ scl ] can be made again with the more complicated non - linear equation , so that linearity is obtained in this case also .",
    "this result is another illustration of the general property mentioned in the preceding section : here , it is the self - consistent character of the calculation that avoids the ir  divergences - the solution automatically adjusts its low @xmath0 behavior - and linearity is indeed obtained .      even when linearity is proved , a difficult problem remains : the calculation of the linear coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "analytically , this is an intricate problem , because of its highly non - perturbative character . in the context of non - linear self - consistent equations ,",
    "we have seen that the problem is non - perturbative at two levels : the choice of the non - linear equation , and the resolution of the equation by successive approximations .  in usual perturbation theory , infrared divergences occur in all the integrals contained in the expression of @xmath57 , preventing any expansion in the small parameter @xmath93 around the ideal gas spectrum @xmath159 .",
    "when one includes higher and higher order in @xmath93 terms in the energy , these ir  divergences become more and more severe , so that higher powers of @xmath93 in the denominator compensate exactly those in the numerator .  as a result ,",

    "@xcite , which show that diagrams of all orders in @xmath93 may contribute comparable amounts to the small momentum part of the spectrum , and therefore to the critical temperature shift .",
    "the complexity of the general problem is illustrated by the second leading correction : instead of being proportional to @xmath160 , as one could naively expect , it is proportional to @xmath161 , and therefore manifestly non - analytic @xcite .     however , if we are only interested in the leading order ( linear ) shift of @xmath48 , a simplification is that factors @xmath162   ^{-1}$ ] can systematically be replaced by @xmath163   ^{-1}$ ] ; in other words , the problem reduces to classical field theory , a case in which the temperature shift is exactly proportional to @xmath1 to all orders @xcite .",
    "this simplification can be regarded as the generalization to all higher order contributions of the approximation of ( [ self - dim0 ] ) by ( [ self - dim ] ) .  in the absence of non - linear @xmath1 terms , numerical calculations for finite values of @xmath1",
    "are in principle easier , since a sometimes delicate extrapolation to zero @xmath1 values becomes unnecessary .",
    "nevertheless , in practice , space discretization introduces another length , the lattice parameter , which may re - introduce non - linearities ; a careful extrapolation of the lattice parameter to zero is then necessary .  taking this into account ,",
    "numerical lattice calculations @xcite have indeed provided a precise value , @xmath98 , which appears to be the best determination to date of this coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "classical field theory does not offer an analytic solution , since it is a priori not possible to select a class of well defined perturbation diagrams that are sufficient to give a reasonable value for @xmath50 .",
    "finally , another approach to the problem is given by the large @xmath7  expansion , where one studies the critical temperature of a gas containing particles with many internal states , resulting in an order parameter with @xmath7 components ; the problem is exactly soluble in the limit @xmath164 @xcite and the calculation of various @xmath165 corrections @xcite allows one to extrapolate to the case where the particles have only one internal state ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "other perturbative - variational methods have also been used , see @xcite .",
    "we have already mentioned in   [ non - linear ] that a spatial rearrangement of atoms with low energies takes place , a similar effect to that discussed by lamb et al .",
    "@xcite , but in the space of the relative positions of the particles ( correlations ) instead of their ordinary positions .",
    "the effect is maximal at @xmath167 , so that the atoms in this level condense more easily than they would in a simple repulsive mean field with no @xmath38 dependence ; of course , atoms with very low @xmath38 undergo a similar effect , which vanishes progressively when their momentum increases beyond @xmath120 .  the resulting spectrum @xmath168 is shown schematically in figure 5-a , with the origin of the energies at @xmath141 ( the value of the chemical potential at transition ) ; for comparison , a purely parabolic spectrum is also shown ( dashed line ) .",
    "figure 5-b shows the corresponding variations of the populations @xmath64 , multiplied by @xmath169 in order to give directly their contribution to the total population @xmath7 .  at condensation ,",
    "when @xmath170 , the function goes to a constant for the ideal gas ( dashed line ) , but to zero for the ideal gas ( full line ) - in the presence of interactions , the delta function corresponding to the presence of a bose - einstein condensate appears with no pedestal .",
    "the comparison between the situations for the ideal gas and the repulsive gas immediately shows that every @xmath171 level is less populated at the critical point in the presence of interactions .",

    ", we introduce the function @xmath172 by:@xmath173   = ( 2\\pi\\lambda^{2})^{-1}\\left [   w(\\mathbf{k})-\\beta e_{\\mathbf{k}% } \\right ]   \\label{11}%\\ ] ] if we replace in ( [ 6 ] ) @xmath64 by the long wavelength approximate form @xmath174   ^{-1}$ ] , we can express the change of the critical density created by the interactions as:@xmath175 a priori , one could imagine that the value of @xmath66 depends crucially on the details of the spectrum near @xmath176 .",
    "actually , the density change depends mostly on one parameter , the crossover point where @xmath177 becomes equal to @xmath169 ( the point at which the energy shift introduced by the interaction equals the kinetic energy ) ; it is relatively insensitive to the details of the variations of the spectrum .  for very low values of @xmath0 ( @xmath178 ,",
    "the role of the function @xmath177 is to harden the free particle spectrum so that integrals such as ( [ 8 - 3 ] ) converge ; therefore @xmath179 and the integrand in ( [ 12 ] ) is almost unity .  for a value @xmath120 of @xmath0",
    "comparable to @xmath155 , see equation ( [ 9 ] ) , there is a crossover between the two functions , and one can expect that one rapidly reaches the opposite regime where @xmath180 and the integrand in ( [ 12 ] ) is almost zero .",
    "altogether , we almost find an all or nothing  regime where the population depletion jumps rapidly from complete to zero , so that:@xmath181 which depends only on the value of @xmath0 at the crossover and not on the details of the variations of @xmath177 .",
    "this explains in particular why the calculation of the critical density , or of the critical temperature , is relatively insensitive to the exact value of the universal coefficient @xmath182 which characterizes the power dependence of @xmath183 at low @xmath0 .",
    "feynman has emphasized the role of exchange cycles in bose - einstein condensation @xcite : condensation takes place when a macroscopic exchange cycle can propagate across the whole sample - see also elser s work @xcite , as well as @xcite for a review .",
    "the notion of exchange cycles arises in first quantization , where identical particles are numbered , and where a symmetrization operator @xmath184 is applied in a second step to obtain the correct physical states .",
    "this operator can be decomposed into cycles of particles , usually visualized as a closed path joining all the particles involved @xcite .",
    "the probability of occurrence of a given path decreases rapidly when the distance between two consecutive particles much exceeds the thermal wavelength @xmath107 ; this provides the length scale for the maximum jump of a cycle between particles    reference @xcite discusses how the shift of the critical temperature introduced by the interactions in a homogeneous system can be interpreted in terms of exchange cycles .  in an ideal bose gas just above the transition point , the density fluctuations are large because exchange effects tend to bunch the particles together .",
    "there will be regions of space where the density is lower than average and where , because of the maximum length @xmath107 of the jump of an exchange path , cycles will not easily propagate ; clearly , this effect will oppose the appearance of bose - einstein condensation .  on the other hand , in a dilute repulsive gas , mutual repulsions create a restoring force which tends to make the system more homogeneous ; the occurrence of large regions of low density fluctuations becomes unlikely .",
    "this will facilitate the propagation of large exchange cycles across the whole system , i.e. , bose - einstein condensation .",
    "therefore , a lower density ( or conversely a higher temperature ) are needed to reach condensation .     at this point ,",
    "one may wonder what is the relation between this physical explanation and the calculations presented above : what is relevant is the effects of ir divergences , and therefore physical properties of the system at very large distances ; in this section , what matters is the correlations of particles at a distance of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "this apparent paradox is removed if one remembers that , in our preceding discussion , we were studying one - body properties ; here we are dealing with the propagation of exchange cycles , which depends on two - body properties .  a phenomenon which appears at long distances for single particles can translate into shorter range properties for correlations . here , we will not give a precise discussion of this point , but just develop a plausibility argument .",
    "we use a simplified model where the two - body density operator @xmath185 in the gas is given by : @xmath186   \\left [ 1+p_{\\text{ex}}\\right ]   + .... \\label{14}%\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the one - body density operator and @xmath188 is the exchange operator between particles @xmath127 and @xmath189 .",
    "this relation is exact for the ideal gas , but only an approximation for the interacting gas .  even if some effects of the interactions are already contained in ( [ 14 ] ) through changes of the @xmath190 s , it is clear that more terms should be added to the right of ( [ 14 ] ) to get an exact formula - in particular terms that introduce short range correlations between the particles .",
    "this approximation is sufficient for our present qualitative discussion .",
    "the direct term in the right side of ( [ 14 ] ) is simply a product containing no spatial correlation , so that we will ignore it and focus on the exchange term containing @xmath188 with diagonal elements : @xmath191 since one - particle density operators are diagonal in the momentum representation ( translational invariance ) , this term is proportional to : @xmath192 therefore the two - body correlation function is independent of the sum @xmath193 ( position of the center of mass of the two particles ) , while its @xmath194 dependence is given by the fourier transform of the integral : @xmath195 which , using parity , can be expressed as a convolution integral : @xmath196    at the critical point , we have seen above that the distribution function @xmath64 is the sum of two components : a bose - einstein distribution obtained within a mean - field approximation with a slightly negative value of the effective chemical potential ( proportional to the square of the scattering length @xmath1 ) , and a critical perturbation introduced for small @xmath0 ( comparable to @xmath120 ) by the correlation effects ; the latter is difficult to calculate , but small .",
    "we therefore have : @xmath197 where the first term has a width comparable to @xmath198 while the second has a width @xmath120 .",
    "the two - body correlation function now appears as the sum of three terms : a term in @xmath199   ^{2}$ ] , a crossed term in @xmath200 on which we will focus our interest , and finally a term in @xmath201   ^{2}$ ] , which we will ignore since it is smaller .",
    "the first term is well - known @xcite : it corresponds essentially to an ideal bose gas close to the transition point and contains the usual exchange bump , with a width comparable to @xmath107 , as well as a long exponential tail , equivalent to a zero matsubara frequency approximation - see for instance exercise 12.9 of @xcite .",
    "since the effective chemical potential is proportional to @xmath160 at the transition point , the range of this exponential tail is of order @xmath202 . ] .",
    "the second term is the crossed term ; its fourier transform appears as the convolution of the function @xmath203 by @xmath204 .",
    "since @xmath205 is much narrower than @xmath203 , the function @xmath205 may be approximated by a delta function at the origin , with a positive weight @xmath206 .",
    "we then obtain for the fourier transform of this term : @xmath207 this corresponds to a change of the spatial correlation function that is positive ; it has basically the same spatial dependence as the zero order term , except that no squared function appears here .",
    "it therefore contains an exchange bump that extends to distances comparable to the thermal wavelength , but slightly further because it no longer includes a convolution of two @xmath208 s ; there still is a long exponential tail , with twice the range of the zero order tail .",
    "this simple model illustrates how the physics behind the reduction of the critical density may appear at a different scale , depending whether it is expressed in terms of single particle properties or in terms of correlations .  in the former case , the critical phenomenon",
    "is contained in @xmath209 , which contains mostly small @xmath38 s and is dominated by long distances ; in the latter , @xmath209 disappears from the leading term , so that distances of the order of @xmath107 remain relevant .",
    "as already mentioned , in the thermodynamic limit , bose - einstein condensation is reached in a trap when the density at the center of the trap is exactly the critical density for a uniform gas , including of course the corrections introduced by the correlations .",
    "two effects ( the compressibility effect of   [ compressibility ] and the correlation effect of   [ correlation ] ) then add to each other to determine the change of the critical value of @xmath7  at a given temperature ( or , conversely , the critical temperature at fixed @xmath7 ) .  nevertheless ,",
    "as remarked by arnold and tomasik @xcite , their combination is not trivial because spatial effects in a trap mix up various orders in @xmath1 .  in this section",
    "we study the effects of the interactions on the density profile of a gas in a trap , assuming that the temperature is above , or just at the critical temperature .",
    "we start from the number density at the center , from which we can calculate the density profile by using an equation of state obtained within mean field approximation .",
    "the critical density profile is then derived by setting the density at the center to its critical value , including the correlation effects discussed in the preceding sections , which are beyond mean field theory .",
    "there is nevertheless no inconsistency in this approach ; the reason is that the calculation of the equation of state of the gas reduces to an ordinary virial correction to the pressure , which is perturbative , while the calculation of the critical density remains essentially non perturbative .",
    "we will see that the specific properties of the curves of figure 1 play a role in this problem , in particular the large compressibility of the gas at the critical point",
    ".  roughly speaking , the compressibility of the gas at the center of the trap is large ( @xmath210 ) , but remains much smaller in most other regions of the trap ( practically independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "one can then anticipate that a change of the pressure that is only second order in @xmath1 will correspond to a change of the density of the same order in those regions , but first order at the center .",
    "this will allow one to meet the change of the condensation condition introduced by the correlations effects .",
    "but , since @xmath7 is primarily determined by the density of the gas in those low compressibility regions , this change corresponds to a second order variation is fixed and that the temperature is reduced from above the transition ; the size of the atomic cloud then decreases progressively .",
    "when the system reaches a temperature close to condensation , the compressibility at the center becomes @xmath210 and therefore very large , so that particles tend to accumulate more around this point of space than elsewhere in the trap .",

    "<S> we discuss certain specific features of the calculation of the critical temperature of a dilute repulsive bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> interactions modify the critical temperature in two different ways .  </S>",
    "<S> first , for gases in traps , temperature shifts are introduced by a change of the density profile , arising itself from a modification of the equation of state of the gas ( reduced compressibility ) ; these shifts can be calculated simply within mean field theory .  </S>",
    "<S> second , even in the absence of a trapping potential ( homogeneous gas in a box ) , temperature shifts are introduced by the interactions ; they arise from the correlations introduced in the gas , and thus lie inherently beyond mean field theory - in fact , their evaluation requires more elaborate , non - perturbative , calculations . </S>",
    "<S> one illustration of this non - perturbative character is provided by the solution of self - consistent equations , which relate together non - linearly the various energy shifts of the single particle levels @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these equations predict that repulsive interactions shift the critical temperature ( at constant density ) by an amount which is positive , and simply proportional to the scattering length @xmath1 ; nevertheless , the numerical coefficient is difficult to compute .  </S>",
    "<S> physically , the increase of the temperature can be interpreted in terms of the reduced density fluctuations introduced by the repulsive interactions , which facilitate the propagation of large exchange cycles across the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction    the calculation of the effects of interactions in dilute gases is often considered as a classical textbook problem , which is generally solved with the help of cluster techniques in statistical mechanics ; well known examples are for instance the second virial correction to the pressure , the heat capacity , or to the magnetic susceptibility for a gas of spin @xmath2 particles @xcite .  for gases at low temperatures , all these corrections </S>",
    "<S> are expressed in terms of a single parameter , the scattering length @xmath1 , so that the result is simple . at first sight , the calculation of the first correction to the critical bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  temperature in a dilute repulsive bose gas seems to raise a similar problem .  </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , its solution was not well understood until recently , as illustrated by a large collection of contradictory results in the literature ( see @xcite and references contained ) .  </S>",
    "<S> several reasons underlie the confusion .  </S>",
    "<S> first , for a homogeneous gas at low temperatures , it turns out that a mean field treatment of the interactions leads to an exactly zero shift of the critical temperature ( the critical value of the chemical potential is shifted , but this does not affect the critical temperature ) ; combining mean field theory with additional - and not necessarily well controlled - approximations can then lead to results which are approximation dependent , providing arbitrary @xmath1 power variations and even sign .  </S>",
    "<S> the second reason is that the problem is actually not as simple as it looks .  </S>",
    "<S> it is essentially non - perturbative at several levels @xcite , even if the leading correction term which emerges from the calculations ends up being simply linear in @xmath1 ; we discuss below in more detail this peculiar feature of the calculations .  </S>",
    "<S> in retrospect , this difficulty is actually not so surprising , since the properties of a bose gas are non - analytic around @xmath3 , where the system is at the border of stability ( a bose gas collapses at condensation as soon as @xmath1 becomes negative ) .  </S>",
    "<S> the linearity in @xmath1 is therefore far from obvious , and indeed it turns out that the next correction @xcite is not simply @xmath4 but @xmath5 , clearly manifesting the non - analytic character of the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present article is to return to the considerations of @xcite and @xcite , with more detailed discussion of some of their physical aspects . in particular , we wish to emphasize that the linearity in @xmath1 of the leading term in the correction to the critical temperature may be missed if a non self - consistent theory is used to calculate the effect ; indeed , some calculations found in the recent literature and based on non self - consistent models provide different results , first corrections @xmath6 for instance . </S>",
    "<S> but , before we come to this point , in order to avoid any confusion , we carefully distinguish between two effects which are discussed in this context ; the former takes place in traps only , the latter also in a uniform gas contained in a box . </S>"
