    "semiconductor nanostructures under longitudinal electric field produce pronounced effects on optical properties . @xcite it has been shown that the field induces a red shift of the exciton peaks in the photoluminescence and electro - optical spectra .",
    "the shift of the excitonic peaks to lower energy with the increasing electric fields is known as quantum stark effect , while the reduction of the overlapping between the electron - hole pair wave function by the field is related to quenching of the fundamental transition in the luminescence spectrum .",
    "zero dimensional systems as colloidal semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) under electric fields are appropriate candidates for several device applications , including optical computing and fiber - optical communication ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "also , the micro - photoluminescence spectroscopic technique in single spherical qds has allowed to study fundamental issues of the excitonic states.@xcite    the electro - optical properties , the stark shift , and the dependence of the peak intensity in the optical spectra upon the applied field should depend strongly upon the details of the band structure .",
    "this was demonstrated for quantum wells in the 80s.@xcite it is interesting to investigate the analogous effects in qd , as the three - dimensional confinement causes properties that are beyond the naive enhancement of the effects observed in quantum wells .",
    "for example , in qds the band dispersion no longer exists , the energy spectrum is totally discrete and depends qualitatively upon the dot geometry .",
    "moreover , the high surface to volume ratio originates effects that are intrinsic to qds .",
    "perhaps , the most spectacular finding up to date is the discovery of high luminescence in porous si,@xcite where qds are believed to play an important role.@xcite other striking effects can be found in the dark magneto - exciton luminescence,@xcite and the blinking and spectral shifting of single qd luminescence under external electric fields.@xcite    calculations of the quantum stark effect in spherical qds in the strong confinement regime have been performed in the framework of the parabolic model .",
    "@xcite the simple parabolic model was able to provide a relative good picture for the description of the electronic states in the conduction band .",
    "this approximation breaks down for the calculation of the hole levels due to the fourfold degeneracy and the admixture of the light and heavy - hole bands present in the ii - vi and ii - iii compounds with zinc - blende lattice structure .",
    "a reliable description of the energy band dispersion is ruled by the baldereschi - lipari hamiltonian.@xcite within this approach , calculations of the influence of an external electric field @xmath1 were done in ref .  .",
    "however , this calculation presents several limitations ( for a detailed discussion see ref .  ) .",
    "as it is well known , the dependence of the interband optical transitions upon the light frequency ( absorbed or emitted ) reflects the structure of the conduction and valence bands .",
    "in this paper we study the excitonic stark effect of spherical qds taking into account the valence band admixture using the baldereschi - lipari hamiltonian@xcite . supported by a rigorous treatment of the exciton wavefunctions ,",
    "we have obtained the interband dipole matrix elements taking into account the fundamental symmetry properties of the qd . from the dipole matrix elements",
    "we have obtained the optical selection rules that allow the identification of the exciton levels observed in absorption and luminescence experiments .",

    "excitons with higher @xmath201 can split and give rise to weak optical transitions . if the electric field is not oriented along a 3-order axis , all the degeneracies are removed and additional transitions should appear .",
    "however , as the cubic anisotropy is induced fundamentally through the hole states , the splittings and intensities of the extra lines should be extremely small .",
    "the fine structure that we have revealed can be modified by other effects present in real nanocrystals , such as shape asymmetry , crystal field ( in wurtzite nanocrystals ) , and the electron - hole exchange interaction.@xcite these effects lead to a splitting pattern of the 8-fold lowest exciton into 5-levels , which is combined with the electric field - induced splitting .",
    "non - adiabatic phonon - induced effects@xcite and dielectric mismatch - induced modifications of the coulomb interaction@xcite contribute also to the magnitude of the splittings . for cdse qds with wurtzite structure the relative orientation of the crystallographic axes and the external electric field must have observable signatures in the optical spectra .",
    "these effects may be stronger than those produced by the cubic anisotropy . since our approach ignores these effects our discussion is approximate .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the influence of the electric field on the electron and hole single particle states in cdse nanocrystals , as well as on the exciton states and the optical properties .",
    "we have described the electric - field - induced quenching of the absorption and luminescence spectra and the importance of the exciton effects .",
    "we have found that the coulomb interaction has a large influence on the strength of the optical transitions , even for small quantum dots .",
    "this fact is related to the penetration of electron wave function in the embedding medium , that partially breaks the strong confinement regime .",
    "moreover , we have shown that for small qds the dependence of the exciton binding energy upon the applied electric field is strongly reduced .",
    "for zero electric field we have reported very general expressions for the solutions of the 4@xmath207 hole hamiltonian in spherical qds .",
    "this work was partially supported by alma mater project 26 - 2000 of havana university .",
    "the stark term in the electron effective mass hamiltonian is a component of an irreducible spherical tensor of rank 1 .",
    "the theorem of wigner - eckart and the reduction formulas for compound systems detailed in ref .   allows us to write the matrix elements as @xmath208 where the terms inside @xmath209 and @xmath210 are the wigner s 6-j and 3-j symbols , respectively ."
