    "up to today , various approaches of a theory of quantum gravity have been developed , but none of them has lead to a testable prediction yet .",
    "the main reason for this failure is the general smallness of effects in which both gravity and quantum theory play a role .",
    "it is expected that quantum gravity will only become sizable in situations involving energies in the region of the planck scale , i.e.  of approximately @xmath0 , which in principle restricts the search for quantum - gravitational effects to black hole physics and cosmology of the very early universe .    here , we want to restrict ourselves to looking for potentially observable effects of quantum gravity in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . as a framework we use _ quantum geometrodynamics _ , a direct canonical quantization of general relativity , and we calculate the dominant quantum - gravitational contribution to the cmb anisotropy spectrum by performing a semiclassical approximation to the wheeler ",

    "we consider an inflationary universe with perturbations of a scalar field @xmath1 . the background universe is assumed to be a flat friedmann ",
    "lematre universe with scale factor @xmath2 , where @xmath1 plays the role of the inflaton with the potential @xmath3 we also demand the slow - roll approximation @xmath4 to hold .",
    "the perturbations of the inflaton field are decomposed into fourier modes @xmath5 with the wave number @xmath6 defined to be dimensionless .    with the convention @xmath7 , a redefinition of the planck mass as @xmath8 and the quasi - static hubble parameter denoted as @xmath9 , the wheeler ",

    "we perform a semiclassical approximation @xcite to equation by making the ansatz @xmath15 and expanding @xmath16 in terms of powers of @xmath17 : @xmath18 inserting this ansatz into equation ( [ wdw ] ) and comparing terms of equal power of @xmath19 , we recover the hamilton  jacobi equation for the classical minisuperspace background at order @xmath20 . at the order @xmath21 , we define @xmath22 with @xmath23 imposed to be equal to the standard wkb prefactor .",
    "now we can introduce a time parameter @xmath24 that arises from the minisuperspace background : @xmath25 we then find that each @xmath26 obeys a schrdinger equation with respect to @xmath24 : @xmath27 in order to obtain the power spectrum of the scalar field perturbations , we solve equation by using the gaussian ansatz @xmath28 .",
    "the density contrast @xmath29 in the slow - roll regime at the time @xmath30 when the respective mode @xmath6 reenters the hubble radius is defined as @xmath31^{-1/2}\\right|_{t_{\\mathrm{exit}}}\\,.\\ ] ] by inserting the solution for @xmath32 , we find that @xmath33 , which leads to an approximately scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath34",
    "if we take the semiclassical approximation one step further , to the order @xmath35 , we can define the wave functions @xmath36 that obey a quantum - gravitationally corrected schrdinger equation of the form @xmath37\\psi^{(1)}_k\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "since the first term in the brackets gives the dominant contribution , we will neglect the second term in the following .    from equation ( [ corr_schr_eq ] )",
    ", we can calculate the quantum - gravitational correction to the power spectrum derived above by using the following modified gaussian ansatz : @xmath39   .\\ ] ] with the boundary condition @xmath40 as @xmath41 , we find that we can incorporate the quantum - gravitational modification into a correction term @xmath42 relating the uncorrected power spectrum @xmath43 to the corrected one @xmath44 via @xmath45 : @xmath46 while at first we determined the prefactor @xmath47 to take the value @xmath48,@xcite a recent investigation has found that a subtle change in the implementation of the boundary condition can lead to the alternative value @xmath49.@xcite apart from the sign change , the order of the correction is the same in both cases , however .",
    "one thus sees that the quantum - gravitational correction explicitly breaks the scale invariance of the uncorrected power spectrum and leads to a modification of the power at large scales ( small @xmath6 )",
    ". however , the quantum - gravitational effect would only become significant if the inflationary hubble parameter @xmath9 were close to the planck scale .",
    "but since one can derive an upper bound on @xmath9 from the observational bound of the scalar - to - tensor ratio , @xmath50 , we have to conclude that even in this limiting case the quantum - gravitational effect is extremely small .",
    "furthermore , measurement accuracy is fundamentally limited at large scales by cosmic variance .",
    "this implies that one will not be able to observe this effect even with more precise measurements of the cmb anisotropies by e.g.  planck.@xcite    nevertheless , we can use our analysis to independently derive an upper bound on the hubble parameter . since it was observed that the power spectrum deviates by less than @xmath51 from a scale - invariant spectrum @xcite , we assume that @xmath42 has to be within the limits @xmath52 for @xmath53 . from this condition",
