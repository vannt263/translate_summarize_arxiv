    "observations suggest that these stars are orbiting a highly concentrated mass , which is associated with the compact radio source sgr  a*. it is widely accepted that this source is powered by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "its mass and distance from the sun are estimated to be approximately @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite .    according to the most recent observations of @xcite , the majority ( 136 ) of the early - type stars observed in the sgr  a * region",
    "are located at projected distance @xmath4 from the smbh .",
    "roughly one half of these stars appear to form a coherently rotating disc - like structure , the so - called clockwise system ( cws ; discovered by * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining stars are randomly scattered off the cws plane .",
    "nevertheless , some authors report the existence of a second coherent structure at a large angle with respect to the cws  the counterclockwise system ( ccws ; first mentioned by * ? ? ?",
    "given these two discs , a significant number of the early - type stars are still not belonging to either of the structures",
    ".    observations have further established that all the early - type stars between @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the smbh are either wolf - rayett stars or o- or early b - stars ( wr / ob stars ) @xcite .",
    "evolutionary phases of individual stars indicate that all of them have been formed @xmath7 ago within a short period of time , probably not exceeding @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the presence of such stars so close to a smbh is rather suprising .",
    "in particular , the tidal field of the smbh is strong enough to prevent standard star formation mechanisms .",
    "hence , various hypotheses have been suggested to explain the origin and configuration of the wr / ob stars observed in the sgr  a * region .    in situ fragmentation of a self - gravitating gaseous disc",
    "is probably the currently most widely accepted formation scenario for the stars of the cws @xcite .",
    "this process was theoretically predicted to form stars in active galactic nuclei around smbhs of masses @xmath9@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however , as it naturally forms stars in a single disc - like structure , it fails to explain the origin of the stars observed outside the cws .",
    "many authors have , therefore , been seeking a mechanism that could have scattered these outliers from the parent disc plane .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that two - body relaxation of the parent disc does not yield the observed large inclinations of the outliers with respect to the disc plane . according to @xcite ,",
    "some of them may have been brought to their positions by vector resonant relaxation between the disc and the cluster of late - type stars , which has also been reported in the sgr  a * region @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether this process can explain the origin of the stars with line - of - sight angular momenta opposite to that of the stars within the cws .",
    "in order to overcome this issue , @xcite have considered mutual interaction of two self - gravitating discs at large angles relative to each other .",
    "although this mechanism indeed yields the observed configuration of the wr / ob stars , it needs rather special initial conditions .",
    "in particular , the two discs must have been formed at specific angles with respect to each other in order to stand for the cws and ccws . moreover , as all the wr / ob stars seem to be coeval @xcite , the two discs must have had started to form stars at the same time . since this is not very likely , the need of such special initial conditions represents the major drawback of this scenario .",
    "similar scenarios , such as the interaction of two gaseous streams @xcite , suffer from the same problem .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have suggested that all the wr / ob stars in the sgr  a * region may have been born in a _",
    "single _ gaseous disc .",
    "they argue that the stars observed outside the cws represent the outer parts of the parent disc , that have been partially disrupted by the gravity of the circumnuclear disc ( cnd ) .",
    "the cnd is a clumpy molecular torus , that is located between @xmath11 and @xmath12 from sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "the total mass of this structure , which is almost perpendicular to the cws @xcite , is estimated to be of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite claim that the gravity of the cnd would cause differential precession of the individual orbits in the parent stellar disc .",
    "such a process would force the stars from the outer parts of the disc to leave the disc plane while the inner parts of the disc would remain untouched .",
    "this core would be identified as the cws today .    in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we include the self - gravity of the parent stellar disc , and follow its orbital evolution in a predefined external potential by means of numerical @xmath1-body computations .",
    "in addition to the smbh and the cnd , the external potential includes the gravity of the cluster of late - type stars . even though its density profile is still unclear , its potential may be considered , in the first approximation , to be spherically symmetric , and centred on the smbh .    in the following section",
    ", we briefly introduce the problem of stellar dynamics in a perturbed keplerian potential and describe our model .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in section [ results ] and discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we conclude our work in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the gravitational potential in the vicinity of the cws induced by the smbh is , to a very high accuracy , keplerian .",
    "hence , it is useful to describe the individual stellar orbits by means of keplerian orbital elements : semi - major axis @xmath14 , eccentricity @xmath15 , inclination @xmath16 , longitude of the ascending node @xmath17 , and argument of pericentre @xmath18 .",
    "the orbital evolution of the disc can then be investigated by following the evolution of these elements .",
    "if the only component of the external potential were keplerian gravity of the smbh , and if the stars in the disc were treated as test particles , the orbital elements would remain constant in time . on the other hand , with any additional potentials included , some of the elements may undergo complex secular evolution .",
    "@xcite have investigated the influence of the cnd upon the orbital evolution of the disc .",
    "they have considered the disc to be surrounded by the cluster of late - type stars , and the stars in the disc to be test particles .",
    "they claim that the evolution of individual stellar orbits in the disc is dominated by two processes : ( i ) precession of the ascending node , and ( ii ) periodic oscillations of eccentricity and inclination ( kozai oscillations ; independently theoretically predicted by kozai 1962 and lidov 1962 ) .",
    "these oscillations are diminishing with increasing mass of the cluster of late - type stars .",
    "they become fully negligible when the mass , @xmath19 , of the cluster within the radius @xmath20 of the cnd fulfils the approximate condition @xmath21 , where @xmath22 stands for the mass of the cnd . in that case , the first time derivative of @xmath17 becomes constant and can be writen as @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the gravitational constant and @xmath26 represents the mass of the smbh . according to this formula , the rate of precession strongly depends upon the semi - major axis of the orbit .",
    "hence , the outer parts of the disc are more affected by the precession than the inner parts and , therefore , the disc becomes warped or , eventually , completely disrupted .    in formula ( [ rate ] ) and further on , we assume all angles to be measured in the frame where the cnd lies in the @xmath27-plane .",
    "consequently , inclination of the orbit @xmath16 is the angle between the symmetry axis of the cnd and angular momentum of the star .        with the gravity of the stars in the disc included ,",
    "the orbital elements of individual orbits undergo random variations due to two - body relaxation . as a result , the mean value of eccentricity and inclination of the orbits increases .",
    "these changes are , by themselves , too small to have a significant impact on the overall shape of the disc @xcite . however , according to formula ( [ rate ] ) , they accelerate the differential precession of the orbits .",
    "let us , therefore , further investigate the differential precession of the orbits within a self - gravitating disc . for this purpose , we introduce the model of the galactic centre in the following way",
    "the smbh of mass @xmath28 is considered to be a source of keplerian potential .",
    "the cnd is modelled as a single massive particle of mass @xmath22 orbiting the smbh on a circular orbit of radius @xmath29 ( see subsection [ cnd ] for the discussion of this approximation ) .",
    "the cluster of late - type stars is represented by a smooth power - law density profile , @xmath30 , and mass @xmath19 within the radius @xmath20 .",
    "the early - type stars in the disc are treated as @xmath1 gravitating particles , @xmath31 $ ] , distributed according to a power - law mass function @xmath32 .",
    "the stellar orbits in the disc are constructed to be initially geometrically circular .",
    "however , due to the additional spherically symmetric component of the gravitational potential ( cluster of late - type stars ) , the osculating eccentricities do not truthfully describe real curvature of the orbits in space .",
    "e.g. the initial osculating eccentricity of the outermost orbits in the disc is @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "initial radii of the orbits are , in accord with the observations @xcite , generated randomly between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "their distribution obeys @xmath38 .",
    "the disc is initially thin with half - opening angle @xmath39 .",
    "the initial inclination of the disc plane with respect to the cnd , which is defined by the mean angular momentum of the stars in the disc , is denoted @xmath40 .",
    "we follow the evolution of the latter system numerically by means of the @xmath1-body integration code nbody6 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potentials of both the smbh and the cluster of late - type stars have been incorporated into the original code as additional external potentials .",
    "the evolution of the stellar disc depends upon the shape of the gravitational potential , which is determined by the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath19 , @xmath41 , @xmath1 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath40 .",
    "hence , in order to investigate the evolution properly , it is necessary to cover all the reasonable values of these parameters . on the other hand , in order to demonstrate the results of our calculations , it is useful to define a `` canonical '' model with the parameters set to the values listed in table [ canonical ] .",
    "the observations suggest that all the wr / ob stars have mass @xmath46 @xcite . however , since it is likely that a number of undetected less massive early - type stars exist in the sgr  a * region , we consider @xmath47 $ ] in the `` canonical '' model . nevertheless , for a more convenient comparison with the currently available observational data , we display properties of only a subset of the stars with mass @xmath48 in figures .    due to the stochastic nature of the studied system",
    ", the results should be averaged over a number of realisations with identical values of the model parameters in order to distinguish general trends from random fluctuations . for this purpose",
    ", we first considered 120 realisations of the `` canonical '' model .",
    "it has , however , turned out that the results become statistically relevant already for 12 realisations .",
    "hence , we consider only 12 realisations of all the other models discussed in this paper in order to shorten the necessary computational time ( @xmath49 hours on @xmath50 cpu per run ; @xmath51 runs in total ) .    since we attempt to explain the configuration of a specific observed system , every single realisation represents a possible course of its evolution .",
    "we thus show the standard deviation for some of the key quantities for a more thorough description of the set of possible evolutions .",
    "@xmath52 & @xmath22 & @xmath53 & @xmath19 & @xmath54 + @xmath55 & @xmath56@xmath57 & @xmath44 & @xmath58 & @xmath41 & @xmath59 + @xmath1 & @xmath60 & @xmath40 & @xmath61 & @xmath45 & @xmath62 +   +   +    [ canonical ]    the results for the canonical model are shown in fig.[best ] .",
    "the top - left panel demontrates the differential precession of the orbits in the disc .",
    "it shows the evolution of the mean value of @xmath17 within different groups of stars , which are determined by their initial distance from the centre .",
    "it turns out that the precession of the ascending node affects more strongly the orbits in the outer parts of the disc ( dotted and dot - dashed lines ) than those in the inner parts ( dashed and solid lines ) .",
    "this result is in accord with formula ( [ rate ] ) and proves the gradual deformation of the disc .",
    "our results further show that the precession of the ascending node in the outer parts of the disc is globally accelerated .",
    "we attribute this effect , which becomes significant on longer time scales , to the evolution of inclination due to two - body relaxation of the disc .",
    "such an acceleration was not found by @xcite as they had neglected the gravity of the stars in the disc .     of orbital evolution .",
    "the initial state is denoted by an empty circle .",
    "latitude on the plots corresponds to @xmath16 while longitude is related to @xmath17 .",
    "the top panel shows the results for one of the realisations of the canonical model ( only stars with @xmath48 displayed ) . for comparison ,",
    "the bottom panel illustrates the situation with negligibly small mass of the stars in the disc ( single mass , @xmath63 , the other parameters are the same as in the canonical model ) . ]",
    "the sudden drop of @xmath64 on the dotted line in the top - left panel of fig.[best ] is a residue of kozai oscillations .",
    "since the cluster of late - type stars is , in our canonical model , not massive enough to suppress the oscillations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 entirely , the first time derivative of @xmath17 also varies on the timescale of @xmath65 .",
    "the evolution of the mean inclination @xmath66 with respect to the cnd within different parts of the disc is shown in the top - right panel of fig.[best ] .",
    "we can see that the inclination of the outer parts of the disc is decreasing ( dotted and dot - dashed lines ) , while it grows and saturates at @xmath67 in the inner parts ( dashed and solid lines ) .",
    "we further find that the evolution of both @xmath17 and @xmath16 is similar for all the orbits in the inner parts of the disc .",
    "hence , the core of the disc remains rather undisturbed and coherently changes its orientation towards perpendicular with respect to the cnd .",
    "this effect can be seen in the top panel of fig.[omegavsi ] , which shows the directions of angular momenta of the individual stars in the disc after @xmath68 of orbital evolution for one of the realisations of the canonical model ( the initial state is denoted by an empty circle ) .",
    "our results prove that the compact group at inclination @xmath67 is formed by the stars from the inner parts of the disc , while the remaining scattered stars represent the entirely dismembered outer parts .",
    "hence , we see that the dynamical evolution of the initially thin stellar disc leads to a configuration similar to that observed in the sgr  a * region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the core of the disc can be identified with the cws observed today and , at the same time , the stars from the dissolved outer parts can stand for the wr / ob stars found outside the cws .    in order to compare our results with the observations more thoroughly ,",
    "we further define cws within our model in the following iterative way . as the zeroth step ,",
    "the cws is considered to be formed by a fixed number of the innermost stars from the initial disc . in the next step ,",
    "we exclude from the cws all the stars whose angular momenta deviate from the mean angular momentum of the cws by more than @xmath69 . on the other hand , the stars initially from outside the cws , which do not fulfil the latter condition , are included into the cws .",
    "then , we recalculate the mean angular momentum of the cws and repeat the whole procedure iterativelly until there are no changes of the cws in between two subsequent steps .",
    "observations suggest @xcite that roughly one half of the wr / ob stars are members of the observed cws .",
    "we thus follow within our calculations the relative number of stars , @xmath70 , which belong to the cws . as can be seen in the middle - left panel of fig.[best ] , this number reaches , within our model , the value of @xmath71 at @xmath72 .    as computed by @xcite , the normal vectors of the observed cws and the cnd fulfil @xmath73 , which corresponds to the mutual angle of @xmath74 .",
    "in order to confront this feature , we investigate the evolution of the inclination @xmath75 of the cws with respect to the cnd .",
    "our computations show that @xmath76 at @xmath72 ( see the middle - right panel of fig.[best ] ) , which is in a remarkable agreement with the observational data .",
    "finally , we investigate the eccentricity distribution @xmath77 within the cws and in the whole young stellar system after @xmath68 of orbital evolution .",
    "the corresponding histograms in the bottom - left panel of fig.[best ] show that in both cases a substantial fraction of the orbits have , in accord with the observations , moderate eccentricities .",
    "the mean eccentricity of the stars within the cws ( see the dotted line in the bottom - right panel of fig.[best ] ) is then @xmath78 , which is somewhat lower than the value @xmath79 recently reported by @xcite .",
    "however , at the current level of accuracy , the observations do not provide sufficient information for a reliable determination of the orbital eccentricity for a significant number of the wr / ob stars .",
    "hence , the eccentricity criterion should be considered only as supplemental .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , all the wr / ob stars may have been formed within a single gaseous disc and , subsequently , brought to their present location by the combined effects of two - body relaxation and differential precession . in the following",
    "we establish a set of parameters for which the evolution of the young stellar system leads to a configuration compatible with the current observational data .",
    "for this purpose , we follow the evolution of the system for various values of the model parameters . within the results ,",
    "we then concentrate on @xmath70 , @xmath75 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 and confront their values at @xmath72 with the observations .      to begin with",
    ", we follow the evolution of the young stellar system for various values of @xmath22 and @xmath19 with the other parameters fixed to their canonical values ( see table [ canonical ] ) .",
    "the results indicate that the strongest constraints on the possible values of @xmath22 and @xmath19 come from @xmath70 and @xmath75 .",
    "their values for @xmath82 $ ] are depicted by the solid lines in the top panels of fig.[discuss ] , whereas @xmath22 remains constant along each of the lines and is set to either @xmath83 or @xmath53 or @xmath84 . according to these results",
    ", the evolution of the young stellar disc leads to values of @xmath70 which accommodate the observational constraints , if @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , the upper limit for the mass of the cluster of late - type stars has to be reduced to @xmath87 since larger values do not lead to the observed @xmath76 . both observational criteria",
    "are , therefore , fulfilled if @xmath85 and @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , the results of our computations with @xmath89 show that even in this case , the evolution of the young stellar system leads to a configuration which matches the observational data ( due to logaritmic scale in fig.[discuss ] , the corresponding values are not displayed ) .",
    "hence , we find the final intervals @xmath85 and @xmath90 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath91 , the intervals transform to @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the intervals for allowed @xmath22 and @xmath19 are not affected if we evaluate the eccentricity criterion . as can be seen in the bottom panels of fig.[discuss ] ( solid lines ) , all the considered values of @xmath22 and @xmath19 lead to similar values of both @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that the orbital eccentricities in the young stellar system reach slightly higher values for lower @xmath19 .",
    "we attribute this effect to kozai oscillations , which are less suppressed by the cluster of late - type stars .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest that also for @xmath94 , all the orbits in the young stellar system gain somewhat larger eccentricities , regardless the mass of the cnd . around the same value , @xmath75 appears to be more sensitive upon the variations of @xmath19 and @xmath70 reaches its minima ( see the solid lines in the top panels of fig.[discuss ] ) .",
    "hence , it seems that all of these effects are somehow connected with a stronger influence of the cnd on the dynamical evolution of the young stellar disc .",
    "however , at this point , we can not provide any explanation of this effect .    in order to investigate whether the suggested intervals for @xmath22 and @xmath19 depend upon the density profile of the cluster of late - type stars , we model the evolution of the young stellar system also for @xmath95 and @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "the other parameters remain at their canonical values ( see table [ canonical ] ) .",
    "the dotted line in fig.[discuss ] proves that @xmath70 , as well as @xmath75 and both @xmath80 and @xmath81 , reach the same values as in the case with @xmath35 , except for the neighbourhood of the point @xmath94 .",
    "the absence of the resonant effects observed in this case can be interpreted as a consequence of the different mass of the cluster of late - type stars enclosed within the young stellar disc , due to the different value of @xmath41 . however , since the value @xmath94 represents only the approximate upper boundary of the suggested interval for @xmath19 , the latter effect is , for the purpose of this study , rather insignificant .    similarly , in order to test the dependence of the intervals upon the mass function of the young stellar disc itself , we perform a set of computations with the disc treated as a group of 136 single mass stars each with mass @xmath96 .",
    "the other parameters are set to their canonical values . in this case",
    ", the total mass of the disc is the same as in all the models , which we have presented so far ( @xmath97 ) . as demonstrated by the dashed line in fig.[discuss ] , none of the results depend upon the mass function of the disc if its total mass is preserved .",
    "equal - mass particles .",
    "the other parameters are set to their canonical values ( see table [ canonical ] ) , except for @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "top : angular momenta of individual stars in the young stellar disc at @xmath72 ( initial state denoted by an empty circle ) .",
    "middle : number of stars within the cws ( solid line ) . for comparison",
    ", we show the results for the canonical model ( dashed line ) .",
    "bottom : eccentricity distribution at @xmath72 for all the stars in the young stellar system ( empty boxes ) and within the cws ( grey boxes ) . ]",
    "our calculations further show that the evolution of the young stellar disc is not affected significantly if its total mass is changed within the range @xmath100@xmath101 . on this account",
    ", all the results presented in the previous section would remain entirely unaffected even if we did not include the undetected stars with mass @xmath102 $ ] as their overall mass represents only a small fraction of the total mass of the whole disc .    on the other hand , decreasing the total mass of the disc by reducing the mass of the individiual stars @xmath55 inhibits the combined effects of two - body relaxation and differential precession .",
    "namely , we do not observe the evolution of @xmath75 if @xmath55 becomes negligibly small , i.e. if the stars in the disc can be considered as test particles .",
    "this effect is demonstrated by the bottom panel of fig.[omegavsi ] , where we set @xmath103 .",
    "we can see that except for the few outermost stars , which are still slightly affected by kozai oscillations caused by the cnd , the inclination of the orbits remains constant throughout the disc .",
    "hence , our results are in accord with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we have determined the intervals for @xmath22 and @xmath19 under assumption @xmath104 .",
    "our results indicate that if @xmath105 and both the @xmath22 and @xmath19 fall into the determined intervals , the evolution of the young stellar system leads within @xmath68 to a configuration that agrees with the current observations . with lower values of @xmath40 considered ,",
    "the cws is entirely destroyed by the differential precession before it can reach the orientation perpendicular to the cnd . on the other hand ,",
    "considering @xmath40 closer to @xmath106 may increase the allowed intervals for @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , in order to fully understand the impact of different values of @xmath40 on the suggested intervals , a more detailed study would be required .",
    "we will focus on this issue in our future work .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the young stellar disc to be initially thin .",
    "our calculations show that the course of its evolution does not depend upon the value of its initial half - opening angle if @xmath39 .",
    "so far , we have modelled the cnd as a single massive particle on a circular orbit around the smbh .",
    "this approximation has been used instead of analytical descriptions , e.g. infinitesimally thin ring , for numerical reasons .",
    "namely , due to its simplicity , single - particle approach minimizes the necessary computational time , and the corresponding perturbing particle can be implemented into the original nbody6 code in a trivial way .",
    "the single - particle approximation follows from the standard averaging technique , which is commonly applied to many problems of celestial mechanics ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the single - particle approximation is equivalent to the model with the cnd treated as an infinitessimally thin ring if the assumptions of the averaging technique are satisfied .",
    "for the studied young stellar system , these assumptions can be written as the following two conditions for the orbital period @xmath107 of the massive cnd particle : ( i ) @xmath107 must be significantly longer than the orbital periods @xmath108 of the early - type stars in the disc , and ( ii ) @xmath107 must be significantly shorter than the characteristic period @xmath109 of the studied phenomena . since @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112@xmath113 , both conditions are fulfilled and , therefore , the use of single - particle approximation is , in our case , well justified .",
    "the real cnd is , rather than a ring - like structure , a gaseous torus , which consists of several somewhat autonomous clumps . in order to test whether the evolution of the young stellar disc can be affected by the clumpiness of the cnd",
    ", we further consider the cnd to be a group of @xmath114 equal - mass particles .",
    "it turns out that the cnd constructed in this way is unstable with respect to its own gravity .",
    "consequently , some of the particles successively migrate towards the smbh .",
    "these particles can eventually be identified with several gaseous streams , which are indeed observed within the radius of the cnd ( for one of the most recent studies , see * ? ? ?",
    "the results further show that all the combined effects of two - body relaxation and differential precession remain present ( see fig.[enhanced ] for the case with @xmath115 ) .",
    "moreover , the infalling cnd particles pose a stronger perturbation for the young stellar disc . as a result ,",
    "the orbits in the disc gain higher eccentricities compared to models with the cnd treated as a single massive particle on a stable orbit ( see the bottom panel in fig.[enhanced ] and the bottom - left panel in fig.[best ] ) .",
    "similarly , the gradual deformation of the young stellar disc , as well as its eventual destruction , are also accelerated .",
    "hence , it appears that the models with the cnd treated as a single massive particle somewhat underestimate its influence upon the dynamical evolution of the young stellar disc . on the other hand",
    ", the perturbative influence of the infalling parts of the gaseous cnd would probably not be as strong as the impact of infalling point - like particles in the latter model .",
    "a more precise approach to the gas dynamics would thus be required in order to obtain a more accurate description of the cnd .",
    "we have modelled the orbital evolution of a thin self - gravitating stellar disc in a predefined external potential by means of n - body computations . in accord with the observations of the galactic centre",
    ", we have considered the potential to include the gravity of the smbh , the cnd and the cluster of late - type stars .",
    "the results show that for a significant set of system parameters , the evolution of the disc leads to a configuration similar to that observed in the sgr  a * region within the lifetime of the wr / ob stars . in particular ,",
    "while the outer parts of the disc are entirely dismembered due to differential precession of the orbits caused by the cnd , the inner parts remain undisturbed forming the cws . due to the influence of the cnd , the cws tends to change its orientation towards perpendicular with respect to the cnd for a variety of initial configurations .",
    "indeed , according to the observations , the cws and the cnd are in such a specific mutual orientation",
    ". it may thus be plausible that all the wr / ob stars observed in the sgr  a * region may have been born within a single gaseous disc and , subsequently , brought to their present location by the combined effects of two - body relaxation and differential precession .",
    "we have further determined the possible values of the mass of the cnd , @xmath22 , which lead to a configuration compatible with the observational data . based on several observational criteria",
    ", we have found the approximate interval : @xmath85 .",
    "although this interval represents a very strict constraint on the mass of the cnd , it is in accord with the most recent observational estimate @xmath116 found by @xcite .",
    "moreover , in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , the suggested interval for @xmath22 proves that unperturbed two - body relaxation of the young stellar disc does not lead to the observed configuration of the wr / ob stars .",
    "analogously , we have found the interval for allowed values of the mass , @xmath19 , of the cluster of late - type stars enclosed within the radius of the cnd : @xmath90 . unlike the cnd ,",
    "this interval is rather wide and contains , from the observational point of view , virtually all reasonable values of @xmath19 .",
    "we have confirmed that none of the suggested intervals depend neither upon the shape of the stellar mass function in the young stellar disc nor the density profile of the cluster of late - type stars .",
    "let us note , however , that a less symmetric , e.g. flattened , cluster of late - type stars could have an impact on the evolution of the young stellar disc similarly to the influence of the cnd .",
    "nevertheless , since the current observational data do not provide any indication of such an asymetry , we have not considered this possibility in our analysis . moreover , due to the observed perpendicular mutual orientation of the cws and the cnd , it is likely that the cnd indeed plays a crucial role in the evolution of the young stellar disc .",
    "our results further indicate that the angular momenta of the majority of the wr / ob stars , which are scattered off the cws plane , are expected to point to the same hemisphere with respect to the cnd .",
    "this feature , together with the mass of the cnd , as well as the mutual orientation of the cnd and the cws , represent strongly constrained output parameters of the scenario investigated in this paper .",
    "it would , therefore , be beneficial to concetrate observational efforts on the corresponding quantities and improve their accuracy in order to test the suggested hypothesis .",
    "finally , let us emphasise that the combined effects of two - body relaxation and differential precession are efficient enough to transform the young stellar system into a configuration which matches the observations in a period of time shorter than the estimated lifetime of the wr / ob stars . on this account , the presence of the cnd in the system is not necessarilly required during the whole evolution of the young stellar disc .",
