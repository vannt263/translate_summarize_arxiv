    "sgarface is designed to detect short bursts of @xmath0 rays with energies above 100 mev using the air - cherenkov technique @xcite .",
    "the design allows detection of bursts lasting up to @xmath120 @xmath2s and has a directional accuracy of up to a few arc - minutes @xcite .",
    "bursts of this type could be produced by the evaporation of primordial black holes ( pbh ) , from emission associated with giant radio pulses from pulsars @xcite , or by a high - energy component accompanying very short gamma - ray bursts .",
    "primordial black holes would have been the first objects formed by the gravitational collapse of inhomogeneities in the early universe @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities may have resulted from density fluctuations @xcite present after inflation @xcite , the presence of cosmic strings @xcite , collapse of domain walls @xcite , or from bubble collisions during a phase transition @xcite .",
    "consequently , even without a detection , limits on the pbh density provide important insight into many aspects of the physics of the early universe @xcite , including : cosmological phase transitions @xcite and references therein , structure formation @xcite , mass clustering @xcite , and magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "three effects have been used to search for pbhs :    \\(1 ) gravitational effects : black holes of mass @xmath3 @xmath4 ( @xmath5 g ) may be detectable by their gravitational effects in microlensing observations @xcite or from mass clustering measured with the ly@xmath6 forest @xcite . a significant number of heavier pbhs may have formed binary systems @xcite and may be detected from the gravitational radiation emitted during coalescence .",

    ", black holes with an initial mass of @xmath12  g @xcite would be reaching the final phase of their evaporation which might be explosive .",
    "pbhs that have already evaporated , would have left an imprint on the cosmic particle backgrounds and set stringent limits on the pbh density ; a discussion is given in sect .",

    "\\(3 ) accretion effects :",
    "the accretion onto light black holes may produce distinct observable radiation in the relatively dense environments of interstellar space , in binary systems , or near planets  @xcite .",
    "the types of particles emitted by hawking radiation and their energy spectra are well understood below the qcd confinement temperature of @xmath13 mev @xcite . above this temperature",
    ", it is unknown whether individual elementary particles will be emitted in the strong gravitational field , or if a phase transition of the surrounding vacuum occurs and a thermodynamic model of the emission is valid .",
    "if the standard particle physics model ( sm ) is valid at all temperatures , the emission spectra can be determined from the quark - gluon jet fragmentation functions convolved with the hawking emission function @xcite .",
    "this would result in a slow evaporation at high temperatures : the final explosion would last about 1 s with @xmath0-rays of energies above 400 gev being emitted @xcite .",
    "22% of the total energy would be emitted in @xmath0 rays with a flux spectrum peaking at @xmath1 100 mev and falling off as @xmath14 at higher energies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in thermodynamic models of the qcd phase transition point , the large number of hadronic resonances implies a large phase space and therefore the final evaporation becomes extremely rapid , resulting in an explosion .",
    "the most extreme thermodynamic model is that of @xcite , referred to as the hagedorn model ( hm ) , where the density of states , @xmath15 , increases exponentially with mass : @xmath16 . in this picture",
    ", the ground state of the vacuum contains elementary and composite particles , which are evaporated by the gravitational field of the pbh . during the final explosion , 10 - 30% of the mass at @xmath17",
    "is converted into gamma - rays between 100 mev and 1 gev ; the explosion lasts @xmath1100  ns  @xcite .    instead of completely evaporating , pbhs may leave behind planck mass relics , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "because of their small mass , planck relics do not affect @xmath0-ray emission , but may possibly contribute to dark matter @xcite .",
    "if extra dimensions exist below the currently measured scale of gravity , @xmath1  10  @xmath2 m @xcite , black hole evaporation would release less detectable energy  @xcite .    for sgarface",

    "some of the limits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_limits ] were standardized to the same sm burst by @xcite .",

    "we scale their result to the 99% cl as @xmath33  pc@xmath31  yr@xmath32 , assuming poisson statistics .",
    "another method to detect the evaporation of pbh relies on the neutrino background .",
    "the flux emitted in neutrinos is at least 2 to 3 times larger than the @xmath0-ray flux  @xcite , but so far only the low - energy @xmath27-background has been used to constrain the pbh mass - distribution  @xcite .    another idea to detect pbh explosions was put forward by @xcite , who suggested that a hm burst produces a sphere of simultaneously emitted charged particles , but see the arguments by  @xcite and  @xcite .",

    "taking into account the number of radiation lengths available for electrons until they reach the threshold for cherenkov emission in the atmosphere , the total multiple coulomb scattering angle is roughly proportional to @xmath38 , where @xmath25 is the initial electron momentum  @xcite . similarly , the width of the photon angular distribution arising from compton scattering is proportional to @xmath38 , where @xmath25 is the photon momentum  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the trigger threshold requirement is tested at three equally spaced time intervals during the trigger window , requiring pulses to be at least as long as the trigger window .",
    "the thresholds were set conservatively above the night - sky background and occasionally adjusted to reflect changes in the telescope throughput .",

    "observations with the 10  m telescope are usually only carried out when the weather conditions are judged acceptable for tev astronomy observations .",
    "the mean data rate was 0.18  hz . the dead - time of the data - acquisition ( daq ) system is 0.316 sec per event , and comprised 6% of the total operational time .",

    ", the topology and time development of the images is parameterized on five time scales . as in the hardware algorithm , the analysis sums the fadc traces with a top - hat filter function of width 1 , 3 , 9 , 27 , and 81 samples .",
    "the analysis then proceeds on each time scale as follows :    fluctuations about the pedestal value are produced by night - sky background fluctuations , electronic noise from telescope - drive motors , and intrinsic electronics noise of the daq . in the analysis , the mean pedestal value is subtracted from the trace .",
    "the standard deviation of the distribution of the fluctuations , referred to as rms in the following , is used to set the threshold that channels must cross before a particular sample is accepted as part of the image .",
    "details of the pedestal stability are given in sect.[sec : hardware_stability ] .",
    "the triggering sample in the fadc stack is located at least 814 samples before the end of the trace . therefore , the pedestal of each channel is determined from the first 750 samples with a value less than 40  dc multiplied by the width of the top - hat filter .",
    "the longest trigger time scale of three times 243 samples , or 14.58  @xmath2s , is not used in the analysis because the pedestal value can not be estimated accurately from the initial signal - free portion of the fadc trace . the loss in fluence sensitivity by excluding this time scale is minimal .",
    "next , fadc samples that contain little or no signal are suppressed followed by a moment - analysis to characterize the image shapes .",
    "the cleaning procedure proceeds in two steps : 1 ) any re - binned samples with signal in excess of three times the pedestal rms value are retained .",
    "2 ) samples adjacent in time and space are retained if their signal is greater than twice their pedestal rms value .",
    "all other samples are ignored in the analysis .",
    "the analysis evaluates the trigger requirement on five time scales with a fixed set of thresholds for the entire 6-year data set .",
    "the thresholds were chosen just above the highest hardware levels used during the majority of observations : the thresholds on the trigger time scales are 18 dc ( 60 ns ) , 53 dc ( 180 ns ) , 119 dc ( 540 ns ) , 325 dc ( 1620 ns ) , and 874 dc ( 4860 ns ) .",
    "details of the image and timing parameterization are presented next .",
    "the parameterization proceeds along the following steps :    \\1 ) the duration of the pulse is measured by the 1/@xmath39-width of the summed fadc channels .",
    "\\2 ) the event is integrated for the duration of the pulse .",
    "the integrated image is characterized by the centroid of the light distribution , the width and length , and the rotation angle , @xmath6 , of the major axis away from the camera center , see fig.[fig : hillas ] .",
    "these parameters are calculated from the moments of the light distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , the peak values of the seven brightest pixels , @xmath40 , are recorded .",
    "the contrast ratio is measured from the ratio of the mean brightness of pixels located at distances less than 0.4@xmath22  from the centroid , versus those at distances greater than 1@xmath22 .",
    "\\3 ) the speed of the shower core along the image major and minor axes is measured from the instantaneous centroids of the ten brightest pixels .",
    "the sensitivity of sgarface is determined from monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we use the kascade  @xcite air - shower simulation program , version 7.3 , together with grisu(tah ) @xcite to simulate the air - cherenkov production and telescope response .",
    "the calibration of the light - throughput of the telescope and the gain of the pmts is described in section [ sec : dc_pe ] .",
    "the simulation of the detector electronics includes the single photo - electron pulse shape received by sgarface and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_shape ] .",
    "the long tail in the pulse shape is caused by the implementation of the ac coupling of the signal cables and their back - termination at the camera . due to this signal shape",
    ", more charge is accumulated on longer integration time scales .",
    "this reduces the effective trigger threshold and produces an increase in sensitivity nearly proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "this was unforeseen in the design of the trigger and helps the performance of the mtsd .",
    "the trigger threshold at the shortest time scales corresponds to about 12 cherenkov photons per m@xmath37 per pixel per 60 ns .",
    "data from 2003/4 was used to understand the background events and , in conjunction with simulated bursts of @xmath0 rays , to develop a background - rejection method .",
    "several sources of background are seen in the data and can be separated into atmospheric ( cosmic rays , lightning ) and man - made phenomena .",
    "the largest number of background events are cosmic rays where the cherenkov radiation is seen at various off - axis directions resulting in event durations of up to 100  ns .",
    "sgarface also detects events lasting up to @xmath1450  ns where a central bright spot moves through the field of view .",
    "these events are compatible with fluorescence emission from cosmic rays .    from comments by the 10  m operators",
    ", we determined that lightning produces another type of background seen occasionally in the data .",
    "these events have a patchy structure and are longer than 16  @xmath2s , compatible with the measurements by @xcite that show a duration between 25  @xmath2s and 2  ms .",
    "another type of background that we considered is light from meteor trails .",
    "though the light in the trails has a duration long enough to trigger the mts , @xmath10.3  s @xcite , the lateral angular extend of @xmath420.1@xmath22  @xcite is not large enough to trigger the pattern - sensitive unit with a 7-fold coincidence requirement .",
    "the 10  m observing log contains the rating of weather conditions by the observers .",
    "we did not use these ratings in cutting run - time a - priori for two reasons : one , the ratings are subjective and two , the gps time information was not recorded properly in the 10  m run - header files beginning in 2007 .",
    "the later would have made a cross - correlation of the weather information with sgarface events a very labor intensive project .",
    "instead , we decided to use all available data and only investigate the observing conditions for events that passed our selection criteria . the majority of 10  m observations are taken during good or very good night - sky conditions , though occasionally the telescope was operated for short periods of time when the weather was bad . by including all available data ,",
    "the integrated lifetime of sgarface may be too large large by as much as 10% .",
    "we do not apply a compensating lifetime reduction in the analysis .",
    "background that was identified as man - made includes the light produced by airport / airplane beacons and is detected either directly or from the reflection by haze or clouds in the night sky .",
    "directly visible from the whipple 10  m telescope is the beacon light at the nogales airport .",
    "we have identified some events as arising from these beacons based on the repetition rate .",

    "because the timing and image parameters were calculated using a moment analysis , it is difficult to distinguish the motion of a compact spot from the image of a burst of @xmath0 rays seen largely off - axis . a more sophisticated analysis coupled with cuts on the timing gradient as a function of off - axis distance and image brightness",

    "the other 14 events satisfy the criteria for burst images ; that is they exhibit a broad image shape and uniform time development .",
    "further investigation shows that 12 of these events were seen mainly off - axis , resulting in ambiguity as to the determination of their origin .",
    "it is possible that all events have were caused by cosmic - ray fluorescence emission with the detected variations being due to differences in energy and the viewing angle .",

    "one event occurred during a run flagged as bad by the observers due to a high trigger rate in part of the camera .",
    "another event , fig .",

    "[ fig : cherenkov_distribution ] . in any case , these events are excluded because the 10  m was not performing astronomical observations .",
    "the remaining two events show a rising time - development past the initial drop - off from the peak and are longer than the 16  @xmath2s fadc depth .",
    "these events passed the analysis cuts because only the initial peak is parameterized while the subsequent time development is ignored .",
    "a possible explanation for these events is distant , high - altitude lightning . in summary ,",
    "no events detected at the longest durations can be explained solely by a burst of @xmath0 rays .    in conclusion , based upon our study of events identified as cosmic - ray background , atmospheric phenomena , or events triggered by rf noise",

    "the experiment is collecting data since march 2003 and makes use of time - resolved images of cherenkov radiation to distinguish the candidate bursts of @xmath0 rays from the much more numerous cosmic - ray initiated showers . in the analysis ,",
    "the detector was modeled in detail and monte - carlo simulations of bursts of @xmath0 rays were used to determine the astrophysical volume over which pbh explosions could be seen . using only a single imaging telescope ,",
    "this is the first time such a detailed search has been carried out and a high background suppression of 98.4% was achieved .",
    "the majority of the remaining cosmic - ray background events are indistinguishable from burst events with a single telescope .",
    "figure  [ fig : limits ] shows the upper limits that could have been achieved in the absence of the cosmic - ray background , i.e. if a second , identical detector had been placed at a large distance and operated in coincidence .",
    "originally , sgarface was designed when the camera on the 10  m camera had a 4.8@xmath22  field of view . with this larger field of view",
    "an almost three - fold increase in pbh detection volume would have been achieved .",
    "the glast satellite is sensitive to bursts of @xmath0 rays above 0.03  gev energy .",
    "while the detector has a dead - time of 26  @xmath2s , multiple photons can be detected within the @xmath1 1  @xmath2s coincidence gate width , enabling a direct search for bursts of @xmath0 rays . in determining the fluence sensitivity of glast to sub-@xmath80 burst of @xmath0-rays",
    ", we require a minimum of 10 photons to be collected . assuming that no events are detected , we show the 99% cl upper limits on the pbh explosion rate for a 2 year exposure in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : glast_limits ] , is the 99% upper limit over the entire energy range of glast , where the total burst energy was taken as before as @xmath20 ev .",
    "glast is most sensitive to burst of @xmath0 rays at @xmath1100 mev due to the relation between sampled volume and @xmath0-ray energy at a fixed total burst energy .    in comparing the upper limits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] , it should be kept in mind that different regions of space are sampled by the different detection techniques .",
    "for example , glast is limited in distance to 14 pc to detect our nominal burst of @xmath0 rays , while sgarface probes pbh explosions out to 60 pc . limits from cosmic particle backgrounds measure the pbh distribution on the scale of the galaxy , while relying on the assumed mass distribution function , galactic halo enhancement , and in some cases the cosmic - ray propagation model , to set limits on the current rate of pbh explosions .",
    "these different techniques complement each other in searching for all possible signatures of pbh evaporation .    in this paper we considered bursts of @xmath0 rays to be produced during the final , explosive evaporation of pbhs . in itself",
    ", a burst detected with sgarface would not be sufficient to claim the detection of a pbh explosion , as bursts might be produced by the emission of @xmath0 rays contemporaneous with giant radio pulses  @xcite or perhaps via some other , as yet undiscovered , mechanism .",
    "the smoking gun to claim the detection of a hagedorn - type pbh explosion would include measurements of the neutrino and graviton emission , as well as radio and optical observations  @xcite , but see @xcite for a refutal on such emission .",
    "future searches for bursts should strive towards such a multi - messenger approach .",
    "sgarface is background limited and an unambiguous detection can only be made if the cosmic - ray background can be suppressed .",
    "the coincidences from a second telescope separated by at least a few hundred meters can be used to veto events caused by cosmic - ray initiated showers and other local phenomena .",
    "the veritas array of air - cherenkov telescopes @xcite is located 7 km from the whipple 10  m telescope . while sgarface has a lower fluence sensitivity than veritas to detect @xmath2s - bursts ,",
    "the data from simultaneous observations with the two instruments can be used to reject short cosmic - ray events .",
    "the analysis of these simultaneous observations is forthcoming and will focus on a search for bursts of @xmath0 rays from point sources , such as the crab pulsar .",
    "the sensitivity of the air - cherenkov technique to detect pbh explosions can be improved by implementing the imaging , multi - timescale trigger pioneered with sgarface , on an array of telescopes . with a telescope separation of @xmath11  km",
    ", a global array trigger system would operate background free and reduce the single - telescope trigger threshold . a larger mirror area would further increase the sensitivity , while a wide field of view increases the volume searched for pbh explosions .",
    "for example , if the array consists of telescopes with 20  m diameter , 6@xmath22  field of view , and improved noise characteristics , the volume over which pbh explosions can be detected increases by a factor of 20 to 30 over sgarface .",
    "we thank the veritas collaboration and the staff at the whipple observatory for operating and maintaining the 10  m project .",
    "we thank roy mckay , harold skank , and gary sleedge at isu for their help in the electronics design and testing .",

    "fk acknowledges support for the sgarface project by the department of energy , high energy physics division , through the outstanding junior investigator program and generous financial support by iowa state university .",
    "the accuracy to which the energy response of sgarface can be calibrated depends on the performance and stability of the optical throughput of the telescope , the photo - electron to digital - counts conversion ratio , and the uniformity of the camera response across the field of view .",
    "the telescope response to cherenkov light was calibrated by direct measurement of all components involved . from previous measurements of the whipple 10  m electronics and the design of the sgarface daq , the expected digital - count ( dc ) per photo - electron ( pe ) is @xmath81 , where the error is due to systematic uncertainties of some 10  m measurements .",
    "as these measurements were done only once and at separate times , a second method was developed to track instrumental variations .",
    "it consists of two parts :    \\1 ) events that are recorded simultaneously by both , whipple and sgarface , are used to cross - calibrate the light - level between each cluster of pixels .",
    "cosmic rays produce coincident events about 70% of the time , providing a large enough statistical sample to perform a nightly calibration .",
    "one such coincident event is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr_example ] . the ratio of the total light measured in digital counts by whipple versus sgarface is @xmath82 , and it is very stable over the five - year time span .",
    "the statistical error is due to gain variations between pixels .",
    "\\2 ) the light - throughput of the whipple 10  m is measured from recorded images of complete muon rings .",
    "cherenkov light detected from complete muon rings measures the quality of the local , @xmath76 500 m , atmosphere and the telescope optics and electronics throughput .",
    "this includes gain changes in the pmt .",
    "the periodic variations in the measured light throughput seen in fig .  [ fig : sgarface_dcpe ] is due to aging of the pmts followed by subsequent increase of the applied high voltage .",
    "because of uncertainties in the ultra - violet response of the mirrors and pmts , the dc / pe value was tied to the directly measured value of 3.3@xmath230.3  dc / pe for the 10  m in november 2000 instead of using the absolute value derived from the muon calibration .    using this cross - calibration method ,",
    "the dc / pe ratio was determined to be 0.93@xmath230.1  dc / pe for sgarface at the time of the directed measurement and is therefore in agreement with the value obtained from the direct measurements .",
    "we note that two channels ( 18 and 54 ) exhibit large variations in the calibration ratio and we found this to be due to either , one , or two channels dropping out in the whipple daq .",
    "the sgarface fadc input is biased by pull - up resistors to avoid zero - crossing of the digital values .",
    "this pedestal level is measured for every channel on an event - by - event basis from the first 750 samples with value below 40 dc.typical pedestal values are 10 - 30 dc .",
    "pedestal variations arise from the night - sky background .",
    "the pedestal level may also drift with temperature and noise in the data - acquisition system .",
    "the rms pedestal fluctuation , as measured by the standard deviation of the distribution during an event , lies between 1.5  dc and0 4.5  dc , depending on night - sky condition and pmt gain .",
    "changes in the mean pedestal value between consecutive events show a spread of 1.3 dc rms . over the long term ,",
    "the pedestals were very stable ; all channels showed less than 2  dc drift over the five year analysis period .",
    "a minor hardware problem was identified where on rare occasions , traces would start at 0 dc and remain at that level for up to entire stack length . the analysis filters out rare instances of missing fadc traces .",
    "the sensitivity across the field of view of the whipple 10  m camera is set by the gain of individual pmts . to achieve a uniform gain , the high - voltages of the pmts",
    "are adjusted at the beginning of each observing season . in addition , the whipple high - energy @xmath0-ray observations are flat - fielded in software with an auxiliary calibration run taken each night . for this purpose , a nitrogen flasher is used to uniformly illuminates the camera .",
    "these calibration data are not directly usable for analysis of sgarface data , because the flashes are too bright and saturate the fadcs .",
    "\\1 ) dedicated flat - fielding data were taken at variable brightness levels using a laser system .",
    "the laser flashes were recorded by both , sgarface and the whipple 10  m daq .",
    "the flat - fielding coefficients were determined independently for each system and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gain_laser ] , where the gains of the whipple 10  m have been mapped onto the appropriate sgarface channels .",
    "both sets of flat - fielding coefficients are in agreement with each other .",
    "the @xmath83-difference between the two distribution , calculated using the sample standard deviation of whipple gain and the standard deviation of the mean sgarface gain , is 15.7 with 55 degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the flat - fielding coefficients from a whipple nitrogen run can be used to predict the true flat - fielding coefficients of the sgarface pixel map .",

    "[ fig : gain_nitrogen ] .",
    "it has been established during the many years of operation of the 10  m , that the nitrogen flasher uniformly illuminates the field of view , so that any measured gain differences are intrinsic to the camera .",
