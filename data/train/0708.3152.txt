    "coagulation and fragmentation processes occur in the dynamics of cluster growth and describe the mechanisms by which clusters can coalesce to form larger clusters or fragment into smaller ones .",

    "the distribution function @xmath5 is subject to coagulation and fragmentation phenomena with respect to the volume variable @xmath6 and diffusion in space @xmath7 and is governed by the following equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the coagulation - fragmentation operator acting on the volume variable @xmath10 and these particles diffuse in the environment @xmath11 , which is assumed to be a smooth bounded domain with normalized volume @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the model ( [ full : model ] ) is supplemented with an initial datum @xmath13 and in the following analysis we will consider homogeneous neumann boundary conditions on @xmath14 @xmath15 with @xmath16 the outward unit normal to @xmath11 . we also assume the diffusion coefficient @xmath17 to be non degenerate in the sense that there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath19 let us first describe precisely the coagulation and fragmentation process . in the simplest coagulation - fragmentation models the clusters are usually assumed to be fully identified by their size ( or volume , or number of particles ) .",
    "the coagulation - fragmentation models we consider in this paper describe the time evolution of the cluster size distribution as the system of clusters undergoes binary coagulation and binary fragmentation events .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath20 the clusters of size @xmath6 with @xmath21 , the basic reactions taken into account herein are @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the coagulation and fragmentation rates respectively , and are assumed to depend only on the size of the clusters involved in these reactions .    thus , the coagulation - fragmentation operator is defined by @xmath26 where the coagulation operator is @xmath27 whereas fragmentation mechanism by which a single particle splits into two pieces is given by @xmath28 the coagulation coefficient , @xmath29 , characterizes the rate at which the coalescence of two particles with respective volumes @xmath6 and @xmath30 produces a particle of volume @xmath31 , whereas the fragmentation coefficient , @xmath32 , represents the rate at which the fragmentation of one particle with volume @xmath31 produces two particles of volume @xmath6 and @xmath30 . both coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 are nonnegative functions and @xmath33    for symmetric kernels , we observe that during the microscopic coagulation and fragmentation processes , as depicted in equations ( [ particle1])-([particle2 ] ) , the number of particles varies with time while the total volume of particles is conserved .    in terms of @xmath5 , the total number of particles and the total volume of particles at time @xmath4",

    "the analysis of the so - obtained scheme would allow to prove the convergence of the discretized particle density towards a solution to the continuous problem on a fixed time interval @xmath50 $ ] ( @xmath51 ) , see for instance @xcite , but here our aim is different .",
    "it will consist in the study of the long time behavior of the numerical solution on a fixed mesh in space and volume variables .",
    "indeed , often in applications we are interested in steady states or in the long time behavior of the solution , it is then important to design a numerical scheme , which has good stability properties uniformly in time and remains consistent with respect to the exact solution for long time .",
    "thus , the scheme proposed in this paper is designed such that it preserves qualitative properties of the exact solution as steady states of the coagulation - fragmentation operators ( [ qcf])-([qff ] ) . moreover , an estimate of the entropy dissipation due to an appropriate finite volume approximation with respect to space and volume variables is given and the scheme is shown to give a consistent approximation of the continuous problem in the long time asymptotic limit @xmath52 .    before describing more precisely our results , let us recall that the coagulation and fragmentation equations ( [ full : model ] ) with ( [ qcf])-([qff ] ) have been the object of several studies recently .",
    "on the one hand , among the various approaches for the approximation of coagulation and fragmentation models , we may distinguish between deterministic and monte carlo methods .",
    "we refer for instance to @xcite for deterministic methods , @xcite for stochastic methods , and the references therein . concerning the convergence analysis of numerical methods for coagulation and fragmentation models , we refer to @xcite for a rigorous study of quasi monte - carlo methods . for deterministic approximations ,",
    "the situation is different since the relationship between discrete and continuous models has been considered by some authors , see the survey paper @xcite and @xcite . a rigorous setting for the formal analysis performed in @xcite under general assumptions on the coagulation and fragmentation coefficients has been given in @xcite .",
    "then , similar techniques are used to prove convergence of discrete schemes to the exact solution in @xcite .    however , few is known concerning the stability and the analysis of the numerical solution in the long time asymptotic limit . for the continuous model , in reference @xcite ,",
    "the authors are able to apply the techniques of weak compactness , as in the paper by r.j .",

    "lions @xcite about the boltzmann equation , to prove the weak stability of weak solutions . in the case when an @xmath41-theorem holds , they can obtain some partial information about the large - time behavior of solutions .",
    "more recently , j. a. carrillo _ et al .",
    "_ prove exponential decay of the solution towards equilibrium for the inhomogeneous aizenman - bak model @xcite using entropy dissipation methods @xcite .",
    "our analysis for discrete models will be inspired by these works .",
    "we now briefly outline the contents of the paper . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the numerical approximation of ( [ full : model ] ) and state the stability result which we prove in section [ apriori::sec ] . in the final section ( section  [ test : num ] ) ,",
    "some numerical simulations are performed with the numerical scheme presented in section  [ sec2 ] and the long time behavior of the solution is investigated .",
    "in order to compute an approximation of this model using a finite volume method in space variable @xmath7 and volume variable @xmath53 , we observe that the coagulation - fragmentation operator can be written in a conservative form . indeed , writing equation in a `` conservative '' form , as proposed in @xcite , enables to describe precisely the time evolution of the total volume .",
    "also , this formulation is particularly well adapted to a finite volume discretization which , in turn , is expected to give a precise account of volume conservation . precisely , the coagulation and fragmentation terms can be written in divergence form : @xmath54 where the operator @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 is @xmath58 finally , the coagulation - fragmentation equation reads @xmath59 and we assume that the initial datum @xmath60 is a nonnegative function which satisfies : @xmath61 here and below , the notation @xmath62 stands for the space of the lebesgue measurable real - valued functions on @xmath63 which are integrable with respect to the measure @xmath64 .    when designing the volume discretization of the coagulation and fragmentation terms , it is necessary to truncate the infinite integrals in formulae - . but",
    "this means restricting the domain of action of kernels @xmath24 and @xmath25 to a bounded set of volumes @xmath6 , that is , preventing coagulation to occur among particles with volume exceeding a fixed value .",
    "the discretization we propose is based on the conservative truncation method for the coagulation and fragmentation terms .",
    "given a positive real @xmath65 , let @xmath66 @xmath67 in that case , @xmath68 foreach @xmath7 so that the total volume of the solution is now nonincreasing with respect to time .",
    "as regards the fragmentation term , the truncation is also a conservative truncation on the fragmentation term . using the same idea , we introduce for @xmath66 @xmath69 then",
    ", the conservative coagulation - fragmentation operator satisfies exactly the conservation of total volume , so that the following equation is indeed a truncated conservative coagulation and fragmentation equation : @xmath70 since @xmath71 under the detailed balance condition ( [ dbc ] ) , model ( [ evian ] ) has also a steady state @xmath72 , only depending on @xmath6 and such that @xmath73.\\ ] ] and @xmath74 convergence for large values of @xmath65 has been thoroughly studied in the recent past .",
    "we briefly mention some results for the coagulation equation ( that is , with @xmath75 ) .",

    "let us mention that when @xmath76 as @xmath77 , convergence as @xmath78 of the solutions to ( [ evian ] ) toward a solution of ( [ coag : op])-([evol : eq ] ) can be proven by using the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "thus , since the convergence of solutions to towards solutions of ( [ coag : op])-([evol : eq ] ) is well established in rather general situations , this paper will only focus on the convergence of a sequence built on a numerical scheme towards a solution to the equation when the truncature @xmath65 is fixed . in the remainder of the paper , for the sake of clarity",
