    "_ @xmath2-permutation _ of @xmath20 $ ] is an injective function from @xmath21 $ ] to @xmath20 $ ] . when @xmath22 , a @xmath2-permutation is a permutation .",
    "so any @xmath2-permutation @xmath23 can be represented by a vector @xmath24 where @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the set of all @xmath2-permutations of @xmath20 $ ] by @xmath27 .",
    "the set @xmath28 is the _ image _ of @xmath23 and denoted @xmath29 . unlike permutations which have a decomposition into cycles , @xmath2-permutations in general do not have such a decomposition .",
    "we observe that a decomposition of a @xmath2-permutation into cycles and ` paths ' is possible where paths are the same as cycles except that in a path the last element is not mapped to the first element .",
    "we then define the cycle type for a @xmath2-permutation @xmath23 to be the list of integers consisting of the lengths of the cycles and the paths appeared in the decomposition of @xmath23 .",
    "this gives rise to the ` cycle - type partition ' of @xmath27 in which each class consists of all elements of @xmath27 sharing the same cycle type .",
    "the reason for studying the cycle - type partition of @xmath2-permutations will become clear below .    the _ @xmath0-arrangement graph _",
    "@xmath1 has @xmath27 as its vertices , and two @xmath2-permutations @xmath30 and @xmath31 are adjacent if they agree in exactly @xmath4 positions , i.e. if for exactly one @xmath32 , @xmath33 and for all @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the family of arrangement graphs was first introduced in @xcite as an interconnection network model for parallel computation . in the interconnection network model",
    ", each processor has its own memory unit and communicates with the other processors through a topological network , i.e. a graph . for this purpose ,",
    "the arrangement graphs possess many nice properties such as having small diameter , a hierarchical structure , vertex and edge symmetry , simple shortest path routing , high connectivity , etc .",
    "many properties of arrangement graphs have been studied by a number of authors , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "another family of graphs with the same nature as the arrangement graphs are the derangement graphs .",
    "@xmath3-derangement graph _ is a graph whose vertices correspond to all the permutations of @xmath20 $ ] where two permutations are adjacent if they differ in all @xmath3 positions .",
    "it is known that the eigenvalues of the derangement graph are integers ( see @xcite ) . for other properties of the eigenvalues of the derangement graph",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .    as an application of the cycle - type partition of @xmath27 , we consider the problem of determining the eigenvalues of the arrangment graphs .",
    "it turns out that the cycle - type partition of @xmath27 is indeed an equitable partition of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "normally , the eigenvalues of equitable partitions of a graph give a subset of the set of eigenvalues of the graph .",
    "however , in view of a result of godsil and mckay @xcite , the cycle - type partition of @xmath27 is fine enough to give the complete set of eigenvalues as well as their multiplicities",
    ". consequently , we will be able to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath1 for small values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that any eigenvalue of the johnson graph @xmath5 is an eigenvalue of @xmath1 .",
    "( recall that the johnson graph @xmath5 has all the @xmath2-subsets of @xmath20 $ ] as vertices where two @xmath2-subsets are adjacent if they intersect in exactly @xmath4 elements . ) finally , we prove that that @xmath6 is the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath1 with multiplicity @xmath7 for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "we shall close the paper by some open problems on eigenvalues of the arrangement graphs .",
    "a permutation can be decomposed into disjoint cycles .",
    "however , in general such a decomposition does not exist for a @xmath2-permutation . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate how a decomposition of @xmath2-permutations is possible by taking into account a relaxation on cycles .",
    "we call a @xmath2-permutation @xmath23 a _ path _ of length @xmath16 if for some @xmath36 and @xmath14 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40 $ ] for all @xmath41 and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "we denote such a path @xmath23 by @xmath43 $ ] . as usual , @xmath44 denotes a cycle of length @xmath16 . the same method for decomposing permutations into disjoint cycles",
    "can be employed for decomposition of @xmath2-permutations into disjoint cycles and paths .",
    "we call this decomposition the _ cyclic decomposition _ of @xmath2-permutations .",
    "here is examples of decompositions of some 5-permutations : @xmath45(5\\,j],\\\\ ( 2,3,4,i , j)&=(1\\,2\\,3\\,4\\,i](5\\,j],\\\\ ( 2,i , j,5,4)&=(1\\,2\\,i](3\\,j](4\\,5),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "we put this observation formally in the following proposition .",
    "the straightforward proof is similar to the case of permutations .",
    "any @xmath2-permutation is a product of disjoint cycles and paths .",
    "this decomposition is unique up to the order in which the cycles and paths are written .    in some applications",
    ", it would be useful to consider a graphical representation of a @xmath2-permutation @xmath23 .",
    "this can be done simply by constructing a ( directed ) graph with vertices @xmath21\\cup{{\\rm im}}(\\pi)$ ] and with the set of arcs @xmath47\\}$ ] .",
    "we call the resulting graph , the _ basic graph _ of @xmath23 and denote it by @xmath48 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath48 consists of a union of directed cycle graphs and path graphs where the cycle and path graphs correspond to the cycles and paths in the cyclic decomposition of @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that in @xmath48 all the edges in the cycles and paths have the same directions , the vertices of @xmath21\\cap{{\\rm im}}(\\pi)$ ] have degree two , other vertices have degree one , and that any vertex of @xmath49 $ ] is the head of a ( directed ) path . in table",
