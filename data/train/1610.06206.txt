    "among the most luminous objects in the low - redshift ( @xmath4 ) universe are the ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , l(8 - 1000)@xmath5m@xmath610@xmath7l@xmath8 , @xcite ) with star - formation rates of up to several hundred m@xmath8yr@xmath9 .",
    "although low - redshift ulirgs are rare , with a space density similar to qsos ( 0.001 per deg@xmath10 ) , their contribution to the co - moving star formation rate density increases dramatically with redshift , by approximately three orders of magnitude by @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , making them an important population for understanding the cosmic history of stellar and super - massive black hole ( smbh ) mass assembly .",
    "recent studies , especially from esa s _ herschel _ space observatory  @xcite , have shown that the low - redshift ulirgs may not be direct analogues of their high redshift counterparts . in the local universe , ulirgs are invariably mergers hosting compact ( @xmath3kpc ) star - forming regions and agn ( e.g. @xcite ) , but at higher redshifts ulirgs may host more extended star - forming regions , and be associated both with interacting and isolated galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the high redshift ulirgs thus lie on the galaxy mass - specific star - formation rate density ( ssfrd ) relation ( the so called main sequence ) , making them typical rather than extreme at these redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an invaluable tool in understanding why this change in the properties and importance of ulirgs with redshift occurs is infrared spectroscopy , since it probes ionization conditions of the interstellar medium and star - forming regions . in particular ,",
    "infrared spectroscopy can probe the large reservoirs of carbon monoxide ( co ) in ulirgs , which trace the total molecular gas reservoir , by constructing their co spectral line energy distributions ( sleds , @xcite ) .",
    "the lower rotational transitions , co(1 - 0 ) up to about co(3 - 2 ) , trace the total cold dense gas ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , while the higher j transitions trace the warmer gas associated with the pdr and xdr regions .",
    "therefore , to trace the different temperature components within the gas , observations covering many co transitions are required . however , since only the low - j lines ( j@xmath36 ) are accessible from the ground , observations with _ herschel _ over the co(5 - 4 ) up to co(13 - 12 ) range are necessary to discriminate the contributions from uv and x - ray excitation via star - formation and agn , respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the co sled in low - redshift ulirgs can also be used as templates for comparison for intermediate to high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , far - infrared spectroscopy gives access to several important fine - structure lines , which provide complementary diagnostics of ism conditions .",
    "for example , low - redshift ulirgs show a deficit in the strength of their [ cii ] fine structure line at 158@xmath5 m relative to the far - infrared ( fir ) dust continuum compared to lower luminosity galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but this deficit is not apparent at higher redshift ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we report on a comprehensive _ herschel _ survey of a flux - limited sample of low - redshift ulirgs , producing a co atlas including all ulirgs in the universe out to @xmath12 .",
    "an extensive co spectral atlas of extragalactic objects has also been published in @xcite . in section [ sec : sampleobservations ] , we introduce the source sample and describe the _ herschel _ observations . in section [ sec : reduction ] we describe the data reduction steps using standard processing pipelines and also the post - processing steps required to produce the final spectra . in section",
    "[ sec : linefitting ] , we describe our line fitting procedure , providing identifications and line fluxes for our sample . our results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a detailed analysis of the co sled fits will be presented in hurley et al , in preparation .",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath13kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 and density parameters of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the _ herschel _ ulirg survey ( herus , pi farrah ) was the largest extragalactic open time survey ( ot1 , 250 hrs ) carried out by the _",
    "herschel _ space observatory .",
    "herus is a flux limited sample of low - redshift ulirgs comprising the 43 ulirgs from the iras psc - z survey @xcite with 60@xmath1 m fluxes greater than 1.8jy ( table [ tab : observations ] ) .",
    "the sample was observed by _",
    "herschel _ using the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire , @xcite ) in both photometry ( 250 , 350 , 500@xmath1 m ) and spectroscopy using the spire fourier transform spectrometer , ( fts , @xcite ) from 194671@xmath1 m ( except 3c273 which only has photometric data ) .",
    "the spire photometry and spectroscopy observations were carried out between 26th july 2011 ( _",
    "herschel _ operational day , od 804 ) to 19th october 2012 ( od 1178 ) . the observations are summarised in table [ tab : observations ] .",
    "the spire photometer observations were carried out in small map mode ( _ spirephotosmallscan _ , pof10 , @xcite ) with fixed , 3 repetition ( 445s ) , cross - linked 1@xmath161 scan legs covering a field of 4@xmath17 radius .",
    "images are taken simultaneously in the spire 250@xmath1 m ( psw ) , 350@xmath1 m ( pmw ) , and 500@xmath1 m ( plw ) bands .",
    "note that 3c273 only has photometric data and the photometric data for iras 06035 - 7102 was in fact extracted from the open time key programme : kpot@xmath18mmeixner observations of the large magellanic cloud , level 2.5 _ herschel _ data product .",
    "spire spectroscopic observations were made in point source spectroscopy mode ( _ spirespectropoint _ , sof1 , @xcite ) with high spectral resolution ( hr , 0.048cm@xmath9 ) , and sparse spatial sampling .",
    "observations ranged from 45 - 100 repetitions ( forward + reverse scans of the fts , 6316 s ",
    "13752 s ) depending on the predicted source continuum level .",
    "the spire - fts measures the fourier transform of the spectrum of a source with two bolometer detector arrays ( see figure [ fig : detectorarrays ] ) ; the spectrometer short wavelength ( ssw ) and spectrometer long wavelength ( slw ) simultaneously covering the entire wavelength range from of 194313@xmath1 m ( ssw ) and 303671@xmath1 m ( slw ) respectively .",
    "although the spectrometer arrays have 37 detectors ( ssw ) and 19 detectors ( slw ) , only the central sswd4 and slwc3 detectors are used for the point source spectrum .",
    "in addition to the target spectroscopic observations , the corresponding instrument _ dark sky _ _ obsid _ intended for background subtraction , for each spectroscopic observation is also listed ( section [ sec : reduction ] ) .",
    "these dark skies were supplied by the spire instrument control centre ( icc ) on an observational day basis and were not attached specifically to the observation programme itself .",
    "observations that were included in our data processing from _ herschel _ archival data but were not within the herus programme itself are denoted by asterisks .",
    "the spectroscopic observation of iras07598 + 6508 had to be repeated due to a pointing error in the initial observation ( obsid = 1342231979 ) but the photometric data were still usable .",
    "far - infrared spectroscopy was made using the _ herschel _ photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ,  @xcite ) .",
    "observations with pacs for the 43 ulirgs is split between the herus programme @xcite and the shining programme @xcite . a similar study of the intermediate redshift ulirg population ( 0.21 @xmath3 z @xmath3 0.88 ) has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the entire sample has already been observed @xcite with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , @xcite ) onboard spitzer @xcite .",

    "also shown is the infrared colour given by the iras flux ratio c2=s@xmath22/s@xmath23 . ]",
    "in order to probe the dependency of the shape of the sled on the c(60@xmath24100 ) index further , in figure [ fig : coslopesiras ] we plot the l@xmath25 , l@xmath20 , l@xmath26 and l@xmath27 line luminosities normalised by l@xmath28 as a function of c(60@xmath24100 ) index .",
    "we focus on sources with firm detections in all co transitions .",
    "ulirgs where the fractional contribution of the agn to the total bolometric output exceeds @xmath2940% have been denoted with an open square and are not taken into account when estimating the slope of the correlation .",
    "the presence of an agn with significant contribution to the total bolometric output was established based on the presence of [ nev ] @xmath3014.32@xmath1 m or a very deep @xmath31 m silicate absorption feature ( e.g. @xcite ) . of the herus ulirgs",
    ", six have agn contributions @xmath3240% ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of the sled dependence on broadband colours is extended to spire wavelengths in figures [ fig : coslopesirasspire ] & [ fig : coslopesspire ] which again show the l@xmath33 line luminosity normalised by l@xmath28 this time as a function of iras / spire 100@xmath1m@xmath24250@xmath1 m and spire 250@xmath1m@xmath24500@xmath1 m colours respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : coslopesiras ] shows that as the c(60@xmath24100 ) index increases , the co gas gets warmer .",
    "this is demonstrated by the inversion in the slopes of the linear fits to the data as a function of @xmath21 , changing from -0.54 for the co(1 - 0 ) , through -0.2 for co(6 - 5 ) and @xmath340.031 for co(9 - 8 ) , to @xmath340.63 for co(12 - 11 ) .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficients confirm this : @xmath35 is negative for co(10 ) , close to zero for co(6 - 5 ) and co(9 - 8 ) and positive for co(12 - 11 ) .",
    "the near - zero value ( r=0.03 ) computed for the mid - j transitions implies that the ratios l@xmath36l@xmath28 and l@xmath37l@xmath28 are constant over the values of the c(60@xmath24100 ) explored here .",
    "the scatter in the relations is also noteworthy . for the moderate j lines ( 6 - 5 and 9 - 8 )",
    ", the co / l@xmath28 ratio has approximately the same value , with little scatter , for a wide range in s60/s100 ratio .",
    "for the 1 - 0 and 12 - 11 lines however the co / l@xmath28 ratio changes , and the scatter is greater .",
    "the same pattern is seen for the s100/s@xmath38 ratio ( figure [ fig : coslopesirasspire ] ) .",
    "notably though , the s@xmath38/s@xmath39 ratio shows a different behavior ; a positive correlation with l@xmath40l@xmath28 , and approximately flat relations with the other co line ratios ( figure [ fig : coslopesiras ] ) .",
    "we checked these results by repeating the analysis for the c(60@xmath24100 ) indices using pacs data .",
    "the pacs indices were estimated from continua measurements around the [ oi]@xmath3063@xmath1 m and [ nii]@xmath30122@xmath1 m lines .",
    "however , the pacs observations of the herus ulirgs include only a sub - sample of the spire - fts sample .",
    "nonetheless , it is reassuring that we find similar slopes for the co(6 - 5 ) , co(9 - 8 ) and co(12 - 11 ) correlations .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) data show a larger scatter which we attribute to smaller number statistics from the smaller sample .    in what follows we outline a simple scenario that matches , at least quantitatively , these results . for starbursts in local ulirgs ,",
    "the total ir luminosity is a proxy for the total number of hot young stars in the starburst , largely independently of how those stars are distributed .",
    "the s@xmath22/s@xmath23 ( and to a certain extent the s@xmath23/s@xmath38 ratio ) ratio on the other hand traces the broad - scale geometry of the starburst - how compact it is given the number of stars it has - with a higher ratio implying greater compactness .",
    "this can be justified in terms of the correlation found between the equivalent width of oh(65 ) and c(60/100 ) in @xcite .",
    "the s@xmath38/s@xmath39 ratio on the other hand traces cold , but still star formation heated dust , whose properties are more decoupled from the co gas reservoir than the hotter dust .",
    "these ratios may also provide an indication of the age and star formation history of the starburst , therefore determining the relative amounts of hot , warm , and cold gas .    turning to the co lines , the baseline assumption is that the co(1 - 0 ) line is tracing the bulk of the cold co gas reservoir , at some distance from star forming regions .",
    "the lines from approximately co(6 - 5 ) through co(9 - 8 ) on the other hand trace warmer co in the outer parts of pdrs , or the nearby ism .",
    "finally , co lines from approximately co(12 - 11 ) and up trace hot co in the inner pdrs or hii regions .",
    "their luminosities are thus affected by small scale ` microphysics ' of the starburst , giving rise to a larger scatter with fir color since this measures the geometry on larger scales of the star forming regions .",
    "a consequence of this scenario is that co sleds of star - forming ulirgs could be matched with three components ; a cold gas component , responsible for the low - j ( j@xmath34 ) transitions , a ` warm ' gas component giving rise to the mid - j transitions and a ` hot ' gas component which is responsible for j@xmath329 transitions .",
    "this component will likely also have a contribution from agn - heated gas .",
    "this simple picture is however complicated by more energetic processes that are likely to be present in the majority of ulirgs .",
    "mechanical heating ( supernova - driven turbulence , shocks ) are also likely to be present and play a major role in powering co transitions with j@xmath326 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of water transitions in particular , immediately suggests that shocks are likely to play a role .",
    "for example , although not a ulirg , the co - sled of ngc 1266 has been modeled with a combination of low velocity c - shocks and pdrs @xcite .         for modelling details a a key to the plotted data . here ,",
    "unlike the fit to iras 20087 - 0308 , a single component fit does not adequately reproduce the whole co sled , being unable to account for the lowest transition . ]",
    "we defer a rigorous analysis of this possibility to hurley et al . in preparation , but here show three illustrative examples . using radex",
    "we searched a large grid of temperatures ( t@xmath41 ) , densities ( n(h@xmath2 ) , column densities ( n@xmath33 ) , line widths , and source sizes , for _ single component _ fits .",
    "the parameter space is searched using the nested sampling routine multinest @xcite which uses bayesian evidence to select the best model and samples multiple nodes and@xmath24or degeneracies using posterior distributions .",
    "the details of the modelling can be found in @xcite . from these fits , we can extract maximum likelihood contours for key physical parameters . adopting such a process allows the effects of combining herschel and ground - based co data to be examined .",
    "figures  [ fig : modela ] and [ fig : modelb ] show examples of such an extraction , for two ulirgs , iras 20087 - 0308 and iras 20414 - 1651 , respectively , for which we have obtained ground - based data . in the case of iras 20087 - 0308",
    ", a single component model can reproduce the entire co sled , as has been found for a small number of systems in previous studies @xcite . in the case of",
    "iras 20414 - 1651 however a single component model is clearly inadequate , as it fails to reproduce the co(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "conversely , in figure [ fig : radex ] we show an example of a ulirg where three components can adequately reproduce the entire co sled .",
    "a co atlas from the herus programme has been presented for our flux limited ( s@xmath421.8jy ) sample of 43 local ulirgs observed with the _ herschel _ spire fts instrument , with complementary spire photometry at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath1 m .",
    "post - pipeline processing was employed in order to produce high quality spectra between 194 - 671@xmath1 m .",
    "our spectra were analysed using hipe v11 although custom made routines were used to correct for the effects of ` cooler burps ' .",
    "our conclusions are :    \\(1 ) the co ladder from the j=4 to the j=13 transitions is clearly seen in multiple detections for more than half our sample .",
    "in addition , atomic carbon ( 607@xmath1 m & 370@xmath1 m ) and the ionised nitrogen ( 205@xmath1 m ) fine structure lines are detected for many sources , along with the detection of various water lines .",
    "the important ionised carbon cooling line at 197@xmath1 m was detected in our highest redshift source iras00397 - 1312 at z=0.262 where the line is redshifted into the spire fts observational bands .",
    "we find that ulirg co - sleds do not correlate with l@xmath43",
    ". however , a comparison of the sleds with their far - infrared colours reveals a correlation between the 60@xmath1m/100@xmath1 m colour index and the slope of the co sled with ulirgs exhibiting an increasing slope with j transition having warmer far - infrared colours , and ulirgs exhibiting a decreasing slope with j ( @xmath326 ) transition having cooler far - infrared colours .",
    "this infers that all ulirg sleds require at least three different gas components , in accordance with the trends seen when examining the variation of individual line luminosities with changes in the c(60@xmath24100 ) colour index .",
    "mid - j transitions originate in warm gas ( t@xmath29140 - 260 k ) . since the ratio l@xmath44l@xmath28 remains constant over a wide range of c(60@xmath24100 ) , we suggest that the gas originating in these mid - j transitions is directly linked to on - going star - formation . it is likely that the hot gas component in ulirgs is also associated with shocks or processes directly linked to the presence of agn ( xdrs ) although we can not probe this further based on the current datasets",
