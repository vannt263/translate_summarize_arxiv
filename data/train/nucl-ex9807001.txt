    "experiment 866 , installed at ags / bnl , was designed to investigate au+au reactions in the energy regime of 10  agev  @xcite .",
    "the e866 spectrometers provide particle identification and momentum measurement for a variety of charged particles .",
    "central reactions can be selected by means of an event characterization .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] summarizes recent , partly preliminary results studying central au+au collision at 10.8  agev bombarding energy  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity distributions depicted on the right panel demonstrate the large phase space around midrapidity covered by the experiment .",
    "the distributions of protons and charged mesons are peaked at midrapidity , deuterons exhibit a rather flat distribution .",
    "the protons pile up at midrapidity confirms the expectation of a large amount of stopping and the concomitant expectation of high baryon density in central au+au collisions .",
    "corresponding m@xmath0 spectra of particles emitted at midrapidity are plotted on the left panel in a way that thermal spectra would appear as a straight line .",
    "studying the inverse slope parameters  @xmath1 of the spectral distributions an almost linear increase of @xmath1 with the particle mass results .",
    "the inverse slope parameters of the heavier particles can hardly be described within a thermal picture alone .",
    "similar observations have been made at sps energies  @xcite .",
    "the mass dependence of @xmath1 suggests taking into account flow effects .",
    "accordingly , the data presented here have been analyzed in transverse direction assuming an exploding fireball scenario  @xcite .",
    "a common freeze - out temperature of @xmath2  mev and an average transverse flow velocity @xmath3=0.39@xmath40.05 results which fits to a trend given by similar analysis in the sis / bevalac and sps energy regimes .",
    "most recently , preliminary data on charged particle production measured by e866 and e917 in the energy range between 1 and 10 agev has become available  @xcite .",
    "their analysis will systematically complete the gap in incident energy between sis / bevalac and ags .",
    "positively and negatively charged pions exhibit a significant difference at low m@xmath0 , already visible in the compressed scale of fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , left panel , in addition to their common low - m@xmath0 enhancement .",
    "figure  [ ratios ] studies this difference in detail ,    and for different reactions , including all available data  @xcite at 1 and 10.8 agev incident energy .",
    "the following observations can be made : ( i ) the @xmath5 ratio rises at low pion cm energies for central au+au collisions both at 1 and 10.8  agev  .",
    "( ii ) the high - energy asymptotic value of this ratio , beyond 400 mev , levels off close to one . (",
    "iii ) the ratio of pions from peripheral reactions at 10.8 agev does not depend on the pion energy .",
    "it agrees with the integrated negative to positive pion ratio of 1.20@xmath40.15 measured at central collisions .",
    "( iv ) the ratio of charged kaons does not depend on the kaon cm energy . and most important ,",
    "( v ) the low - energy rise of the pion ratio is most pronounced at 1  agev , exceeding the isobar value of 1.95 which reflects the n / z asymmetry of the colliding system .",
    "it is intriguing to note that the measured integrated negative to positive pion ratio is 1.9@xmath40.1 at this incident energy .",
    "these observations point to the presence of significant coulomb final state interactions between emitted charged pions and the remaining nuclear charge distribution .",
    "hence , data are analyzed in the framework of a static coulomb source resting at midrapidity  @xcite , giving rise to a distortion of spectral distributions due to both a momentum shift and a change of the momentum phase - space density .",
    "the assumption of a static scenario is motivated by considering pions with kinetic cm energies above 60  mev only .",
    "the corresponding cm velocities ( @xmath60.7 ) are significantly larger than the expansion velocity of the nuclear fireball ( @xmath70.45  @xcite ) .    at ags energies",
    "the pion spectra and the corresponding ratio can be well described within this static scenario , yielding a rather moderate coulomb energy of 9@xmath43  mev",
    ". the corresponding coulomb potential does not affect the charged kaons within the experimental acceptance .",
    "similar results consistent with a moderate effective coulomb potential have been reported for sps data  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , using the same static approach to describe the sis data fails . an detailed analysis  @xcite including pion energy dependent coulomb energies suggests , that low - energy pions feel rather moderate coulomb forces at freeze - out , while high - energy pions , which are produced well below nucleon - nucleon threshold at 1  agev incident energy , are exposed to a rather high coulomb potential above 20  mev when freezing - out .    in reference",
    "@xcite the variation of the coulomb energy with the pion cm energy is interpreted as an experimental evidence for different freeze - out radii of high- and low - energy pions emitted in central au+au collisions at 1  agev : low - energy pions are emitted predominantly from a more dilute nuclear charge distribution with consequently larger effective freeze - out radii compared to high - energy pions , emitted from a more compact source .",
    "refined model calculations  @xcite support this interpretation and suggest that charged pion spectra probe the dynamics of nuclear expansion in relativistic heavy ion collisions . in particular at low incident energies , different freeze - out radii can be linked to pion emission during different stages of the reaction .",
    "whereas low - energy pions are emitted later during expansion , high - energy pions freeze - out early  @xcite , still at a time where the nuclear density is enhanced and multiple baryon - baryon collisions preferentially trigger the production of energetic subthreshold pions and kaons .",
    "in contrast , the comparably weak signal of charged pion ratios at higher bombarding energies indicates , that the coulomb source disintegrates fast compared to the time scale of pion emission . consequently , the extracted coulomb energy represents an averaging over reaction dynamics .",
