    "the ads / cft ( or more generally gravity / gauge theory ) correspondence@xcite is a surprising but significant finding in field theories and string theories .",
    "the original correspondence claims that a @xmath1 dimensional conformal field theory is equivalent to some @xmath0 dimensional super - gravity theory on an ads background .",
    "after the first proposal , there appeared many pieces of evidence which indicate that the correspondence is true , and applications to various areas in physics , such as ads / qcd or ads / cmp , have been successfully investigated .",
    "even though the ads / cft correspondence might be explained by the closed string / open string duality , the claimed equivalence is still mysterious and a deeper understanding on the correspondence is necessary .    in a previous paper@xcite ,",
    "two of the present authors and their collaborator tried to understand the gravity / field theory correspondences from a different point of view , proposing an alternative method to define a geometry from a field theory : a quantum field theory in @xmath1 dimensions is lifted to a @xmath0 dimensional one using gradient flow@xcite , where the flow time @xmath4 , which represents the energy scale of the original @xmath1 dimensional theory , is interpreted as an additional coordinate .",
    "then the induced metric is defined from this @xmath0 dimensional field . as the metric",
    "is derived from the original @xmath1 dimensional theory together with its scale dependence , the method proposed in the paper can be applied in principle to all field theories . as a concrete example , the method was applied to the o(@xmath2 ) non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) in two dimensions , and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the three dimensional induced metric was shown to describe an ads space in the massless limit .",
    "there are two key aspects in this proposal .",
    "first of all , the @xmath0 dimensional induced metric becomes classical in the large @xmath2 limit , and the quantum corrections can be calculated order by order in the large @xmath2 expansion .",
    "secondly , in the example mentioned above , the three dimensional induced metric , constructed from a product of three dimensional flow fields at the same point , is free from uv divergences in the large @xmath2 limit . instead ,",
    "if the original two dimensional fields were used directly to define the two dimensional metric , it would badly diverge .",
    "these two special properties allow us to infer that ( the vev of ) the induced metric describes a geometry .    in this paper",
    ", we further investigate this proposal , explicitly considering a more general model , the o(@xmath2 ) invariant @xmath3 model in @xmath1 dimensions , which can describe the free scalar model as well as the nlsm as limiting cases .",
    "furthermore , as a generalization of the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the case that parameters ( mass and coupling ) are different in the original @xmath1 dimensional theory and the flow equation , in order to see how the behavior of the flow field depends on the choice .",
    "we also introduce a normalization of the flow field , to interpret the gradient flow as a renormalization group ( rg ) transformation .",
    "our normalization condition for the flow field requires a rescaling factor which becomes unity in the nlsm limit , so that the result in the previous paper@xcite is unchanged .",
    "we then define the induced metric from this normalized flow field .",
    "it turns out that the metric defined in this way leads to the same geometry , irrespective of parameters in the flow equation as well as in the original @xmath1 dimensional theory .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 dimensional space described by the metric becomes ads both in uv and ir limits as long as @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in this section , we briefly summarize the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite and explain some modifications introduced in this paper .    in this paper we consider the large @xmath2 scalar field @xmath6 with the @xmath1 dimensional space - time coordinate @xmath7 and the large @xmath2 index @xmath8 , whose action @xmath9 describes the @xmath3 model and will be explicitly given in the next section .",
    "the @xmath1 dimensional field @xmath10 is extended to @xmath11 in @xmath0 dimensions , using the gradient flow equation as@xcite @xmath12 with the initial condition @xmath13 , where the flow action @xmath14 in this paper can be different from the action @xmath9 in the original @xmath1 dimensional theory .",
    "since the length dimension of @xmath4 is 2 and @xmath15 , a new variable @xmath16 is introduced .",

    "the average @xmath26 in the above definition will be defined in the next paragraph .",
    "the reason why we use @xmath22 instead of @xmath27 to define the metric is as follows .",
    "the rg transformation consists of two procedures : first uv modes are integrated out and then the field is normalized for the rg flow to have a fixed point .",
    "since the gradient flow itself corresponds to the former procedure only , a field normalization is introduced as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rescaling ] ) .",
    "one may adopt a different field normalization , but eq .",
    "( [ eq : rescaling ] ) leads to interesting results as will be seen in later sections .",
    "we call this condition the nlsm normalization , as @xmath28",
    ".    the above @xmath29 is an induced metric on a @xmath0 dimensional manifold @xmath30 from some manifold in @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 , which becomes an @xmath33 dimensional sphere after the quantum average as @xmath34 . here",

    "although the finiteness of the flow field was proven for gauge theories@xcite and some scalar theories@xcite ( see also the latest extension in @xcite ) , it is not guaranteed in general .",
    "indeed it was pointed out recently that the flow field of the @xmath3 model gives an extra uv divergence in perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "( the modified flow equation can avoid this divergence.@xcite ) as shown later , however , the induced metric @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) is free from such uv divergences in the large @xmath2 limit . in appendix",
    "[ app_divergence ] , we explicitly demonstrate that a divergence indeed appears in perturbation theory , but it disappears non - perturbatively in the large @xmath2 limit . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath1 dimensional induced metric were defined from the @xmath1 dimensional field @xmath44 , it would diverge badly , and hence a geometry could not be defined from it .",
    "moreover , thanks to the large @xmath2 factorization , quantum fluctuations of the metric @xmath43 are suppressed in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the @xmath45-point correlation function of @xmath43 behaves as @xmath46 showing that the induced metric @xmath43 becomes classical in the large @xmath2 limit , and quantum fluctuations are sub - leading and calculable in the large @xmath2 expansion .",
