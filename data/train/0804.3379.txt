    ", it is expected that the ejected bubble will quickly reach a nearly force - free state . therefore , hereafter , we assume @xmath73 , corresponding to minimum initial bubble lorentz force .",
    "given reasonably low injection velocity @xmath80 , there are always an mhd shock and a reverse slow - mode compressible mhd wavefront , whose structures , evolution , and propagation characteristics are essentially the same .",
    "and the injection velocity has little influence on the shock speed and wavefront speed ( see table  [ speed ] ) , which implies that the shock and wavefront result from the expansion of the bubble due to the lorentz force , rather than a  piston effect \" of the bubble propagation .",
    "however , the  piston \" effect could become important with larger injection speeds @xmath81 ( see table  [ speed ] ) , which , however , will not occur in the experiment .",
    "for the following analysis , we will focus on the case @xmath82 as being representative for the experiment .",

    "hereafter we define axial direction as the direction along @xmath20-axis , @xmath58-@xmath59 plane as toroidal plane and @xmath58-@xmath20 plane as poloidal plane .",
    "several features can be identified .",
    "first , an mhd shock can be seen around @xmath85 in the profiles of @xmath4 , @xmath86 [ see fig .",
    "[ identification](left ) ] and @xmath87 [ see fig .",
    "[ identification](right ) ] . in the vicinity of @xmath88 , since the magnetic field lies in the shock plane and is perpendicular to the shock normal , this shock is identified as a perpendicular shock in this region .",
    "this mhd shock is a fast shock whose properties are very close to an ordinary field - free shock . as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure](left ) , the magnetic field components @xmath89 and @xmath90 change very little across the shock .",
    "it is important to verify that this is indeed an mhd shock by comparing the simulation results to the the shock jump conditions .",
    "choosing the velocity frame so that the shock is at rest ( shock velocity is @xmath91 ) and simplifying the notation for the problem , we represent quantities in the upstream region by a @xmath92 superscript and those in the downstream region by no superscript .",
    "then there are @xmath93 known quantities @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "there are @xmath93 unknown quantities in the downstream region , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath87 , @xmath86 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus we need @xmath93 conditions to specify them .",
    "we consider the 1-d ideal mhd shock jump conditions for simplicity .",
    "the equations are as follows : @xmath104 a _ matlab _",
    "code was used to solve this nonlinear system of equations , given the values in the upstream region : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath105 and @xmath94 .",
    "the results of @xmath102 , @xmath87 , @xmath86 and @xmath89 matches pretty well ( see table  [ jump ] ) .",
    "the nonzero simulation values of @xmath103 and @xmath89 result from 3-d effects .",
    "the relatively large differences seen in the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are possibly due to nonzero numerical diffusion in the simulations .",
    "there is an mhd wavefront at @xmath106 , as seen in both panels of fig .",
    "[ structure ] , where @xmath86 and @xmath89 have their local minimum , and @xmath4 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 have their local maxima .",
    "the nature of this mhd wavefront can be identified by plotting the axial pressure profiles along the line @xmath84 at @xmath75 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ reverse ] .",
    "a transition occurs near @xmath106 , where an increase in gas pressure @xmath5 is accompanied by a decrease in magnetic pressure @xmath109 .",
    "the transition is identified as a reverse slow - mode compressible mhd wavefront . between the shock ( @xmath85 ) and the wavefront @xmath110 ) ,",
    "the magnetic field lines are compressed and some thermal energy has been converted into magnetic energy .",
    "therefore the gas pressure has an abrupt decrease while the magnetic pressure increases rapidly between the shock and wavefront ( see fig .  [ reverse ] ) .    from fig .",
    "[ reconnection ] , it can be seen that anti - parallel reconnection of the @xmath86 component occurs around @xmath111 , facilitated by numerical diffusion although the simulation is performed with an ideal mhd code .",
    "it is possible that @xmath89 component reconnection takes place around @xmath112 , where the bubble field is not exactly anti - parallel to the background field ( more details in sec .",
    "[ balance ] ) .",
    "the reconnection is driven by magnetic field line compression due to the reverse slow - mode compressible mhd wavefront . from fig .",
    "[ current_z ] , two strong toroidal current sheets are observed at the reconnection layer and the mhd shock .",
    "these are also due to the compression of the magnetic field lines due to the wavefront and shock , respectively .",
    "the reconnection and the shock / wavefront convert normal velocity into tangent velocity and convert kinetic energy into thermal energy . because this is an ideal mhd simulation , the details of the reconnection are not expected to be accurate .",
    "we are only interested here in the qualitative effects of the bubble evolution due to reconnection .",
    "the evolution and propagation of the magnetic bubble can be further understood by examining the various forces along @xmath84 at @xmath75 , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ forces ] .",
    "the mhd shock breaks the initial background equilibrium .",
    "the passage of the shock wave heats the gas and alters its pressure gradient .",
    "the axial flow is pushed forward by both the gas pressure gradient and lorentz force at the mhd shock while it is dragged back behind the shock , resulting in an axial deceleration of the gas in the postshock region .",
    "although the lorentz force tries to accelerate the axial flow at the mhd wavefront , the gas pressure holds it back . therefore the mhd shock will be driven forward and eventually separated from the wavefront , which leads to a cavity of depleted density between the shock and the wavefront .",
    "figure  [ forces2 ] displays axial profiles of various forces along @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath75 .",
    "the locations are chosen to be where anti - parallel reconnection ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ forces2 ] ) occurs and its reflection about @xmath115 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ forces2 ] ) .",
    "this figure clearly shows the difference between the two locations : the lorentz force changes sign ( similar to fig .",
    "[ forces ] ) on the left hand side while keeping the same sign ( negative ) on the right hand side , which is consistent with reconnection happening on the left hand side and not on the right hand side . at both @xmath58 locations , the toroidal current densities @xmath116 are much larger than the poloidal current densities ; however , the toroidal field component @xmath89 is close to zero .",
    "therefore @xmath117 is much bigger than @xmath118 .",
    "anti - parallel field lines on the left hand side result in a sign - change of the axial lorentz force , while the lorentz force on the right hand side does not change sign since @xmath86 does not change sign there .",
    "the sign change of the lorentz force is necessary for reconnection since this is the driving force to pull the field lines from either side of the current sheet together to reconnect .",
    "also , the total force is more negative on the right hand side compared to the left hand side .",
    "this means that the axial flow in the right hand side is slowed down more quickly than the left hand side , which leads to the asymmetry of the shock propagation across the @xmath58 axis .",
    "the magnetic bubble evolves into a nearly quasi - force - free state ( see fig .",
    "[ lorentz ] ) , with a lorentz force that scales in time roughly as : @xmath119 the time scale of this relaxation @xmath120 is dependent on the value of @xmath49 , which determines the amplitude of the initial lorentz force .",
    "larger initial lorentz force leads to quicker relaxation . for @xmath79 , @xmath121 ; for @xmath73 , @xmath122 ; and for @xmath78 , @xmath123 .",
    "the relaxation happens on the order of the sweet - parker reconnection time @xmath124 ( see definitions and estimates of @xmath125 and @xmath126 in sec .",
    "[ discussions ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath127 for @xmath73 , which is similar to the lorentz force relaxation time of 0.386 . however , it should be noted that the lorentz force in the shock / wavefront is always significant ( fig .  [ forces ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the evolution and properties of the bubble itself , including a simple kink stability analysis .      density ( fig .",
    "[ rho ] ) and fluid velocity vector ( fig .  [ velocity ] )",
    "plots in the @xmath128 plane at different times both demonstrate that the initial fast - rotating spheromak - like magnetic bubble evolves into a much larger slow - rotating , fast - expanding elliptical structure with maximum density reduced by @xmath129 times , while the density at the wavefront and the shock increases by @xmath93 and @xmath130 times , respectively .",
    "the center of the bubble shifts away from the original propagation axis with @xmath84 .",
    "figure  [ field_xy ] displays the vector magnetic field plots in the @xmath128 plane at different times . from the figure",
    ", we can see that the bubble field still keeps a spheromak - like configuration and the expansion of the bubble pushes away the background fields , thus compressing them .",
    "some reconnection happens in the region @xmath131 because the bubble toroidal field component is opposite to the background field there .",
    "these figures show that the background field breaks the symmetry of the system , which is consistent with the results of sec .  [ balance ] and sec .  [ transport ]",
    "it is worth noting that the initial expansion of the bubble in @xmath58-@xmath59 plane results from the non - free initial lorentz force as well as the centrifugal force due to the strong initial rotation of the bubble , although the latter quickly slows down to a small value because of the conservation of angular momentum associated with the initial quick expansion and the possible kelvin - holmhotz instability associated with the initial strong toroidal velocity shear .",

    "this explains why , between the shock and wavefront , the advection transports the angular momentum in negatively when @xmath166 while positively when @xmath167 since the shock is always propagating outward ( eq .  [ eq : advection ] ) .      angular momentum transport in the poloidal plane , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath58-@xmath20 plane at @xmath71 , is presented in fig .  [ momentum ] ( @xmath160 is zero on this plane ) . inside the bubble , @xmath148 due to the expansion of the bubble transports angular momentum outward normal to the wavefront , while @xmath154 due to the bubble field redistributes angular momentum inside , transporting angular momentum clockwise on the left hand side and anti - closewise on the right hand side",
    ". this can be understood from the spheromak - like magnetic field configuration of the bubble .",
    "the total effect is to transport net angular momentum from the right hand side to the left hand side of the bubble edge , leading to positive angular momentum on the left hand side and negative angular momentum on the right hand side of the bubble edge ( fig .",
    "[ angular ] ) .",
    "in this paper we presented initial nonlinear ideal mhd simulation results of the expansion of a magnetic bubble into a lower pressure weakly magnetized background plasma .",
    "the simulations mimic the ongoing experiment pbex , except that we use simplified `` out - flowing '' boundary conditions and ignore collisional effects .",
    "a high - density magnetized bubble is injected into a cylindrical background plasma .",
    "the bubble evolution is dependent on @xmath49 , with larger @xmath49 resulting in an axially expanding bubble like a growing  mushroom \" and smaller @xmath49 producing a  crab - like \" shape expanding normal to the direction of propagation .",
    "the expansion of the bubble generates one leading mhd shock and one trailing reverse slow - mode compressible mhd wavefront .",
    "the shock / wavefront speed is independent of the injection velocity for injection velocities similar or below @xmath168 . in the @xmath58-@xmath20 plane",
    "anti - parallel reconnection takes place on the left hand side of the wavefront , where the bubble field is opposite to the background field , while in the @xmath58-@xmath59 plane the reconnection takes place if @xmath131 .",
    "the azimuthal angular momentum is transported outward from the center to the edge of the bubble by advection , and from the right hand side to the left hand side of the bubble edge by the maxwell torque . outside the bubble",
    ", angular momentum is transported from the top left to the bottom left and from the bottom right to top right by the combination of maxwell and pressure angular momentum fluxes .",
    "the initial uniformly rotating bubble quickly evolves into a quasi - force - free state , and the center of the bubble ceases to rotate and starts to rotate oppositely in the long run , while the outside neighboring plasmas start to rotate differentially : the top right and bottom left regions possessing the same rotating direction as the original bubbe while the top left and bottom right regions possessing the opposite rotating direction , which forms shears in the system .",
    "the background magnetic field breaks the symmetry of the system along the propagation axis . for comparison , simulations with 2 orders of magnitude lower background field ( and correspondingly lower density and temperature in order to preserve the equilibrium of the background plasmas ) were also performed .",
    "the results show much better symmetry along the propagation axis .",
    "more detailed studies of the role of the background field will be the subject of future work .    from table  [ toroidal",
    "] , the resistive dissipation time due to numerical diffusion is inferred to be @xmath169 , which is longer than the time ( @xmath75 ) at which the shock has reached the @xmath58 and @xmath59 boundaries .",
    "the alfvn time can be calculated as @xmath170 , where @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) is the typical length of the reconnection layer and @xmath173 is the alfvn speed ( @xmath174 ) at the reconnection layer .",
    "this gives @xmath175 .",
    "thus the effective lundquist number @xmath176 in the simulations is around @xmath177 .",
    "please note that this is the lundquist number associated with the reconnection layer and the numerical diffusion used here is the upper limit of the numerical diffusion in the simulations .",
    "the estimate of the mean experimental lundquist number @xmath178 is around @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the characteristic length of the experimental facility , @xmath181 is the initial alfvn speed , @xmath182 is the magnetic resistivity of the plasma at the initial state based on braginskii s formula and @xmath183 indicates the volume average . although there is one order of magnitude difference between them , we expect our ideal simulations with numerical diffusion to give a reasonable estimate of the physical quantities in the real experiment .",
    "another issue important in the experiment is the transit time .",
    "although the value of the transit time is somewhat related to the boundary conditions , our simulations with simplified boundary condition show that the background plasma column radius @xmath184 is large enough to allow the bubble to relax substantially . from fig .",
    "[ overview ] , it is seen that the bubble is still inside the background plasma at @xmath76 .",
    "however , better boundary conditions are needed for the simulations to be meaningful after the shock has reach the boundaries .",
    "the appearance of the mhd shock and wavefront suggests that our experimental facility may provide a unique opportunity to study mhd shocks in a laboratory plasma .",
    "however , we emphasize that these conclusions are based on ideal simulations ( with numerical diffusion ) and that the boundary conditions are not realistic .",
    "this paper is intended as a preliminary exploration of pbex .",
    "we have not attempted to model many of the complexities of a realistic experiment . in future papers",
    ", we will study collisional effects and boundary conditions closer to those of the planned experiment ; work in progress indicates that these will modify the results ."
