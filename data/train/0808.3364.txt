    "analytical techniques developed in the statistical physics of spin models have been widely employed in the analysis of systems in a wide variety of fields , such as neural networks @xcite , econophysical models @xcite , and error - correcting codes @xcite . analogy is drawn between the interactions and dynamics commonly present in the spin models and other systems .",
    "consequently , notions such as cost functions and noises can find their corresponding physical quantities in spin models .",
    "this parallelism contributes to the success of statistical mechanics in various fields .",
    "recently , a statistical physics perspective was successfully applied to the problem of resource allocation on sparse random networks @xcite .",
    "resource allocation is a well known network problem in the areas of computer science and operations management @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to applications such as load balancing in computer networks , reducing internet traffic congestion , and streamlining network flow of commodities @xcite . in a typical setup",
    ", each node of the network has its own demand or supply of resources , and the task is to transport the resources through the links to satisfy the demands while a global transportation cost function is optimized .",
    "the work in @xcite can be extended to consider the effects of bandwidths of the transportation links . in communication networks ,",
    "connections usually have assigned bandwidths .",
    "bandwidths limit the currents flowing in the links or , in equivalent models , the interaction strengths defined on the links connecting the site variables .",
    "the significance of finite bandwidths was recently recognized in several similar problems .",
    "for example , transportation problems with global constraints on interaction strengths were studied , through a model of transportation network with limited total conductance @xcite , and another model of transportation network with limited total pipe volume or surface area which increase the resistance of pipes @xcite . among these studies , constraints on interaction strengths",
    "were implemented as limits on conductance .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we demonstrate the close relation between statistical mechanics and distributed algorithms .",
    "such close relations have facilitated statistical mechanics to provide insights to a number of principled algorithms recently , as illustrated by the relation between bethe approximation and error - correcting codes @xcite , and probabilistic inference @xcite , as well as the replica symmetry - breaking ansatz and the survey propagation algorithm in @xmath0-satisfiability problems @xcite .",
    "these contributions were made in problems with discrete variables . in this paper , we extend the bethe approximation to the resource allocation involving continuous variable with finite bandwidths . since bandwidths limit the currents along the links , both the message - passing and price iteration algorithms proposed in @xcite have to be modified , which enable us to find the optimal solutions without the need of a global optimizer .",
    "the second purpose is to study the behavior of the optimized networks when the connectivity and bandwidth changes , using insights generated from the recursion relations of the free energy .",
    "we observe a number of interesting physical phenomena in networks with finite bandwidths .",
    "for example , there is the emergence of _ bottlenecks _ when the bandwidth decreases , resulting in the shrinking of the fraction of unsaturated links .",
    "we also identify the correlations between the capacities of the nodes and their roles as sources , sinks and relays .",
    "we find that resources are more efficiently distributed with increasing connectivity .",
    "scaling relations are found in the distributions of currents and chemical potentials . in the high connectivity limit , we find a phase transition at a critical bandwidth , above which clusters of balanced nodes appear , characterised by a profile of homogenized resource distribution reminiscent of the maxwell s construction in thermodynamics . when adapted to scale - free networks , changes in this profile enable us to identify the enhanced homogeneity of resources brought by the presence of hubs to nodes with low connectivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the general model , and the analysis is presented in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "we demonstrate the conversion of the derived recursive equations into algorithms in section [ sec : mp ] . in section [ sec : sim ] , we compare the analytic solutions with numerical simulations in networks with low connectivity , and report on the bottleneck effect .",
    "we will examine the limit of high connectivity in section [ sec : highc ] .",
    "we conclude the paper and point out the potential applications of the model in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we address the problem of resource allocation on random sparse networks of nodes and links .",
    "each node of the network has its own supply or demand of resources , and the task is to transport the resources through the links to satisfy the demands while optimizing a cost function of transportation costs .",
    "the amount of resources transported through a link is limited by the bandwidth , which leads to extra constraints in the resource allocation problem .",
    "bandwidth limitations require us to generalize the problem in the following way . in the case of infinite bandwidths ,",
    "currents along the links can be set arbitrarily large to satisfy the demands of all nodes .",
    "hence hard constraints on the satisfiability of the node demands can be realized , provided that the networkwide supply of resource is greater than their resource demand . on the other hand , in the present model of finite bandwidth ,",
    "a node with resource demand can still experience shortage even though its neighbors have adequate supply of resources , since the provision of resources can be limited by the bandwidths of the links .",
    "hence , the hard constraints on node satisfaction of the infinite - bandwidth model is replaced by soft constraints , and the energy function is generalized to include the cost of unsatisfaction , or shortage of resources .",
    "specifically , we consider a network with @xmath1 nodes , labelled @xmath2 .",
    "each node @xmath3 is randomly connected to @xmath4 other nodes .",
    "the connectivity matrix is given by @xmath5 for connected and unconnected node pairs respectively .",
    "except for the discussion on scale - free networks in section [ sec : highc ] b4 , we focus on sparse networks , namely , those of intensive connectivity @xmath6 .",
    "each node @xmath3 has a capacity @xmath7 randomly drawn from a distribution @xmath8 .",
    "positive and negative values of @xmath7 correspond to supply and demand of resources respectively .",
    "the task of resource allocation involves transporting resources between nodes such that the demands of the nodes can be satisfied to the largest extent .",
    "hence we assign @xmath9 to be the _ current _ drawn from node @xmath10 to @xmath3 , aiming at reducing the _ shortage _ @xmath11 of node @xmath3 defined by @xmath12 the magnitudes of the currents are bounded by the _ bandwidth _",
    "@xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 . for simplicity and clarity",
    ", we deal with the case of homogeneous connectivity and bandwidth in the paper , but the analyses and algorithms can be trivially generalized to handle real networks having heterogeneous connectivity and bandwidth .",
    "to minimize the shortage of resources after their allocation , we include in the total cost both the shortage cost and the transportation cost . hence , the general cost function of the system can be written as @xmath15 the summation @xmath16 corresponds to summation over all node pairs , and @xmath7 is a quenched variable defined on node @xmath3 .    in the present model of resource allocation ,",
    "the first and second terms correspond to the transportation and shortage costs respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 corresponds to the _ resistance _ on the currents , and @xmath7 is the capacity of node @xmath3 .",
    "the transportation cost @xmath18 can be a general even function of @xmath19 .",
    "( our model can be generalized to consider transportation costs @xmath20 that are odd functions of @xmath19 . in such cases ,",
    "one simply has to introduce extra quenched variables of the links representing the favored directions of the currents . ) in this paper , we consider @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be concave functions of their arguments , that is , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are non - decreasing functions .",
    "specifically , we have the quadratic transportation cost @xmath24 , and the quadratic shortage cost @xmath25 .",
    "as considered previously , other concave and continuous functions of @xmath20 , such as the anharmonic function in @xcite , result in similar network behavior .",
    "the model can also be extended to probabilistic inference on graphical models @xcite . in this context",

    "this means that the algorithm gives bonuses to the link controls instead of charging them , so as to encourage them to station their resources at the nodes with resource shortage .",
    "the amount of bonus per unit resource compensates exactly the dissatisfaction energy per unit resource .",

    "simulation results collapse almost perfectly with the recursive equation .",
    "we find that the average energy increases with decreasing bandwidths .",
    "physically , decreasing bandwidth corresponds to the increasing limitations in the allocation of resources .",
    "thus , it is natural to have higher energy . in the limit of zero bandwidth with small finite connectivity , the solution is equivalent to the initially unoptimized condition .",

    "a link is idle only if the two connected nodes are satisfied already , with their own initial resources .",
    "the probability of finding an idle link is thus determined by the initial resources of the connected nodes , yielding the fraction of idle links as @xmath128 ^ 2      = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[1-{\\rm erf}\\left(\\frac{\\langle\\lambda\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2 } }      \\right)\\right]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality is specific to the gaussian @xmath80 . the fraction of saturated link is indeed given by @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding limit is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ varyw_smallc ] , which is consistent with the simulation results .      another interesting physical consequence of decreasing bandwidth is also shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ varyw_smallc ] .",
    "we note that as the bandwidth decreases , the fraction of saturated link increases , which is a direct consequence of the attempt to minimize the shortages of nodes fed by the saturated links .",
    "a similar agreement would lead us to anticipate a decreasing fraction of idle links as the bandwidth decreases , since more links should participate in the task of resource allocation .",
    "surprisingly , we notice an increasing fraction of idle links as the bandwidth decreases , in contrast with our anticipation .",
    "this is a consequence of the _ bottleneck effect _ , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bottle ] .",
    "when the bandwidth decreases , resources transferred from the secondary neighbors may become redundant since resources from nearest neighbors already saturate the link to the dissatisfied node , which can therefore be considered as a bottleneck in transportation .",
    "this makes the resource distribution among the nodes less uniform , since resources are less free to be transported through the links . as a result ,",
    "more nodes are having either excess resources or large shortage , leading to a higher network energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of these bottlenecks confirm the efficiency of our algorithms , since redundant flows to distant nodes are eliminated .",
    "the existence of bottlenecks is common in many real networks . among the most common examples are bottlenecks occurring in traffic congestions .",
    "further studies can be carried out to minimize the bottleneck effect , such as using heterogeneous bandwidths for different links .",
    "the highway is an example of enlarging the bandwidth on a link with heavy traffic .",
    "similar considerations have been applied to routing of traffic on telecommunication networks @xcite .      to study the roles played by the different nodes in resource allocation , we consider the example of networks with @xmath130 and very negative @xmath120 , so that all resources in the networks have to be utilized for optimization .",
    "we classify the nodes into four classes , the nodes of each class having @xmath131 to 3 saturated links connected to them .",
    "figure [ satdis ] shows the conditional capacity distribution of these four classes .    for nodes having no saturated links ,",
    "their participation in the optimization task is relatively inactive , and their capacity distribution is approximately gaussian with an average @xmath132 . for nodes having one",
    "saturated link , two peaks are found around @xmath133 and @xmath134 in the conditional capacity distribution , respectively corresponding to nodes acquiring resources from or providing resources to their neighbors , in order to lower the global shortage cost .    for nodes having two saturated links",
    ", we obtain a trimodal distribution .",
    "the right and the left peaks at around @xmath135 and @xmath136 correspond to resource donors and receptors respectively , which export or import resources , saturating two of the connected links .",
    "the central peak at @xmath137 corresponds to nodes with initial resources close to the average value .",
    "these nodes have little tendency to donate resources to their neighbors or receive from them .",
    "thus they are referred as _ relays _ which participate in optimization by transferring resources from one neighbor to another . for nodes with three saturated links ,",
    "we observe a _ four - modal _ distribution .",
    "similarly , the rightmost and the leftmost peaks correspond to _ sources _ and _ sinks _ of resources respectively .",
    "the middle - right and the middle - left peaks correspond to _ source - like relays _ and _ sink - like relays _ respectively , namely , they serve partially as relays and partially as sources and sinks .",
    "all these distributions show the strong dependence of the number of saturated links of a node on its own initial resources , which identify an inborn optimization role for each node during the resource allocation .",
    "the optimal network behavior can be studied analytically in the limit of high connectivity . in this limit",
    ", the bandwidth of the links plays an important role in the scaling laws of the physical quantities of interest .",
    "two cases will be considered in this section . in the first case ,",
    "the bandwidths of the individual links remains constant when the connectivity scales up .",
    "this increases the total available bandwidth connecting a node , and hence the freedom in resource allocation .    in the second case ,",
    "we scale the bandwidth of the individual links as @xmath138 when the connectivity @xmath4 scales up .",
    "hence , the total available bandwidth connecting the individual nodes is conserved , but the burden of transporting resources is divided into smaller currents shared by a larger number of neighbors .    to further simplify the analysis , we set @xmath24 , @xmath118 and @xmath139 in the subsequent derivations .        in the high connectivity limit ,",
    "the magnitudes of the currents in individual links are reduced , owing to the division of the transportation burden among the links .",
    "since the bandwidths remain constant , the fraction of saturated links becomes negligible .",
