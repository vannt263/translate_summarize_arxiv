    "according to kohn s theorem @xcite a spatially homogeneous electric field can only excite the rigid center of mass motion of all the electrons confined parabolically in a quantum dot or wire . in far - infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy this condition is usually satisfied due to the small size of the individually isolated dots and wires compared to the wavelength of the radiation . in order to detect some of the internal structure or relative motion of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) through fir spectroscopy the confining potential has to deviate from the parabolic form .",
    "the deviation is found to influence the fir response of the 2deg in two different ways , besides a trivial blue or red shift : first , the center of mass mode ( the magnetoplasmon ) interacts with higher order harmonics of the cyclotron resonance forming complicated anticrossing patterns @xcite .",
    "second , the formation of compressible and incompressible stripes @xcite in the electron density modulates slightly the dispersion of the lower lying branch in quantum dots @xcite . in addition , effects of the stripe formation in quantum dots have been measured both in tunneling @xcite and transport experiments @xcite .    in this report",
    "we elucidate further the connection between the modulation of the lower magnetoplasmon branch in quantum dots and the formation of compressible and incompressible stripes in the electron density .",
    "we explain the apparent weakness of this phenomenon in the upper main magnetoplasmon branch in quantum dots and the main branch in quantum wires . in both systems",
    "we find similar modulation in the dispersion of weak higher order collective oscillations .    in order to have consistent results for the absorption we use a corresponding self - consistent method for the ground state properties and the excited states of the 2deg .",

    "the coefficient @xmath25 determines the deviation from the parabolic confinement .",
    "the absorption of the quantum dot @xcite and wire @xcite is calculated as a linear response to the self - consistent electrostatic potential @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the induced potential and @xmath28 is the external potential . in case of the quantum wire @xmath29 and for the quantum dot @xmath30 . the external electrostatic field is linearly polarized transverse to the quantum wire but in case of the quantum dot it is circularly polarized with the choice @xmath31 .",
    "the power absorption of the systems is calculated from the joule heating of the 2deg caused by @xmath32 .",

    "comparison of fig.s [ qd_3sub]-[qd_e ] shows that the oscillations of the @xmath44 mode take a maximum value for an integer @xmath50 and concurrently the steps in the density are clear .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath44 mode with @xmath50 have been explained in terms of an oscillating radius of the electronic system @xcite , an effect due to the screening properties of the system .",
    "we prefer to use the picture of compressible and incompressible states to explain the oscillations @xcite . for the @xmath44 mode these pictures",
    "are probably equivalent for intermediate sized dots , but the latter one is more convenient in case of other modes to be discussed here .",
    "kohn s theorem is not programmed explicitly into the numerical calculation but in the density response function all relevant single electron - hole transitions are summed over and in the case of a parabolic confinement only the center of mass modes predicted by the theorem are visible .",
    "slight deviations from the parabolic confinement result in other modes that in the case of few electrons @xcite can be traced back to certain single electron transitions or groups thereof .",
    "the dipole active collective modes of the 2deg in a quantum dot are such that only transitions of electrons observing @xmath51 contribute to the @xmath52 mode , such that just below @xmath45 a hole state with quantum number @xmath53 is formed but above @xmath45 an electron state with @xmath54 is formed .",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "[ qd_e ] shows that the single electron transitions involved are almost exclusively interband transitions satisfying @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath44 mode , on the other hand , has strong contributions from intraband @xmath56 , hence it s much lower energy .",
    "this is also supported by the induced density which for the @xmath44 mode is usually concentrated close to the boundary of the quantum dot where the concerning @xmath53 states have their heaviest weight . now the different properties of the @xmath44 mode with respect to an integer filling factor or not should be clear ; when @xmath50 is not close to an integer @xmath45 is pinned to the bulk states of a particular landau band , where the band rises above @xmath45 its slope is much less than at a crossing point with edge states with higher @xmath53 .",
    "the single electron transitions contributing from this area thus lower the total energy of the collective mode .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath44 mode take a maximum for @xmath57 and a minimum for half integers .",
    "the states pinned to @xmath45 are compressible and the induced density for the @xmath44 mode is concentrated around the narrow stripes of compressible states close to the edge of the dot or close to the edge of a broader region of compressible bulk states in a quantum dot with not all bulk states of a particular band filled .",
    "the oscillations of the @xmath44 mode are thus a direct consequence of the formation of compressible and incompressible stripes .",
    "the main contribution to the @xmath52 mode comes from transitions of occupied bulk states ( @xmath58 ) to empty ( @xmath59 ) states .",
    "the energy of these interband transitions oscillates weakly with the filling factor , but the transitions all add up to the collective motion that can be identified as a rigid oscillation of the center of mass of the 2deg , thus , the dispersion of the main branch of the @xmath52 mode shows only much weaker oscillations than are present in the @xmath44 mode .",
    "[ qd_p1 m ] shows the dispersion of the @xmath52 mode for a parabolic confinement potential with the same deviation as was used for the calculation of the @xmath44 mode in fig .",
    "[ qd_3sub ] . around @xmath60",
    "t the @xmath52 mode shows an anticrossing behavior just left of the line @xmath61 , the magnetoplasmon is interacting with the first harmonic of the cyclotron resonance , a bernstein mode @xcite .",
    "the emerging lower branch of the @xmath52 mode , the branch corresponding to the rigid center of mass motion , becomes independent of @xmath50 , but the higher vanishing mode , that takes on the character of a higher order magnetoplasmon , oscillates with @xmath50 .",
    "the quartic deviation to the parabolic confinement strengthens the contribution of single electron transitions of the form ( @xmath58)@xmath62(@xmath63 ) to the collective oscillations , thus introducing the higher order magnetoplasmons that are blocked by kohn s theorem in a parabolically confined 2deg .",
    "the oscillations of the side branch of the @xmath52 mode ( just above the main branch ) are in antiphase to the oscillations of the @xmath44 mode , explanation can be found in fig .",
    "[ qd_e ] . without an interaction between the electrons",
    "the landau bands would be parallel , and thus equidistant , interaction and screening properties of the 2deg change this .",
    "when @xmath45 lies in the bulk states of a particular landau band , i.e.  a large compressible region is present in the density , then each landau band develops a flat region , but due to the increasing spatial extent of the wave functions of the higher bands the flat regions shrink with growing @xmath64 .",
    "the relative distance between the landau bands has therefore a maximum when the a band is pinned to @xmath45 and a large compressible region in the electron density is present .",
    "the finite size of the wave functions that increases with @xmath64 also explains why the `` layers '' in the density of a relatively small quantum dot get thinner and smaller with increasing @xmath64 .",
    "a large quantum dot does not exhibit this effect .",
    "the observation of higher order dipole active magnetoplasmons opens the question what effects the deviation from the parabolic confinement has on the quadruple active magnetoplasmon @xcite , @xmath65 , even though it has not been measured directly in quantum dots .",
    "this collective mode has contributions of single electron transitions with @xmath66 and is seen in fig .",
    "[ qd_modes ] together with the dipole active modes discussed above .",
    "the quadrupole @xmath52 mode shows a very clear and simple @xmath67 anticrossing , much simpler than in the dipole case .",
    "the quadrupole active @xmath44 mode shows stronger filling factor oscillations than the dipole counterpart and the oscillations are in phase since they have the same origin . in the lower split - off branch of the quadrupole active @xmath52 mode",
    "weak oscillations with @xmath50 are found in phase with the dipole counterpart .    in light of the results above for quantum dots",
    "it would not be unexpected to find some filling factor dependent effects in quantum wires , even though the magnetoplasmon in a parabolically confined system has only one branch corresponding to the @xmath52 mode of a quantum dot .",
    "the electronic density of a quantum wire develops clearly separate compressible and incompressible regions with increasing wire width , and the steps are also clear in the hartree energy spectra . in the case of a dipole excitation the single electron transitions fulfill the conservation of the center coordinate , @xmath68 .",
    "the calculation for the wire has been performed with the following parameters , @xmath69mev , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , other parameters are the same as for the quantum dot .",
    "the results for the dispersion are seen in fig .",
    "[ qw_modes ] .",
    "again we have the @xmath67 anticrossing , now just right of the @xmath61 line . for @xmath72 t the lower branch gains oscillator strength and",
    "corresponds to the rigid center of mass motion of the whole 2deg .",
    "the upper branch is a higher order magnetoplasmon as the induced density confirms .",
    "the dispersion has a very similar overall appearance as the dispersion for the @xmath52 mode of the quantum dot seen in fig .",
    "[ qd_p1 m ] , and the hartree energy spectra show similar properties as the spectra for quantum dots , thus leading to the same explanation of the origin of the oscillations with @xmath50 .",
    "we have been able to explain filling factor dependent oscillations occurring in the magnetoplasmon dispersion for quantum dots and wires in terms of the formation of compressible and incompressible regions in the electronic density of the systems .",
    "the oscillations have been found in the @xmath44 mode of quantum dots @xcite and some indications of them have been found in wires and in the @xmath52 mode for dots . their appearance in wires and in the @xmath52 mode for quantum dots seems to depend on the concerning system to be of intermediate size , i.e.  the effective magnetic length needs to be not much less than one order of magnitude smaller than the system .",
