    "sand dunes are ubiquitous on mars and provide evidence that sand - moving winds have once occured on the red planet .",
    "however , martian dunes do not appear to be moving these days , and thus many authors suggested that dunes on mars have been formed in the past , when the climate of mars was much more earthlike @xcite . on a planet where the present atmospheric density is almost hundred times lower than the earth s , only winds one order of magnitude stronger than on earth are able to transport sand and form dunes @xcite .",
    "such strong winds occur in fact only occasionaly on mars , during the strongest dust storms @xcite . only once during the viking mission , which operated for about six terrestrial years ,",
    "could very little changes on martian soils be detected after such a storm @xcite .",
    "moreover , calculations showed that the sand - moving winds that occurred at the viking landing site lasted for not more than a few tens of seconds @xcite",
    ". could martian dunes have been formed by the action of such rarely occuring winds under the atmosphere of the present mars ?",
    "this is the question that motivates the present work .",
    "the sand that forms dunes is transported by the wind through _ saltation _ , which consists of grains travelling in a sequence of ballistic trajectories and producing a _ splash _ of new ejected grains when impacting onto the ground @xcite .",
    "martian saltation has been studied in wind tunnel experiments and also in numerical simulations @xcite . due to the thinner atmosphere of mars and owing to the lower gravity @xmath0 m@xmath1s@xmath2 , which is nearly @xmath3 of the earth s gravity , saltating grains on mars travel longer and higher than their terrestrial counterparts @xcite . moreover",
    ", martian grains also saltate with faster velocities than grains on our planet . as consequence , the grain - bed collisions or _ splash _",
    "events on mars are expected to be much larger than on earth , due to the larger momentum transfered by the impacting grains to the sand bed @xcite .",
    "what is not known is whether such highly energetic saltation events have been responsible for the formation of the enormous dunes observed in the images of mars . in order to understand this ,",
    "it is necessary to investigate sand transport at length scales comparable to the scale of dunes .",
    "once saltation starts , the wind transfers momentum to accelerate the grains .",
    "thus , the momentum of the air decreases as the flux of saltating particles increases ( `` feedback effect '' @xcite ) . after a distance which is called `` saturation length '' ,",
    "the wind strength is just sufficient to sustain saltation , and the sand flux achieves saturation . in this manner",
    ", dunes that have length smaller than the saturation length will be continuously eroded due to increase of the sand flux and will disappear .",
    "in other words , the existence of a minimal dune size is related to the phenomenon of flux saturation , which could not be investigated from wind tunnel simulations of martian saltation @xcite . while the first wind tunnel simulating martian conditions",
    "is a few meters long , the smallest dunes on mars have length of the order of hundred meters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moc_images ] ) .",
    "recently , a successful modelling of the formation of sand dunes , which encompasses the main processes of saltation and accounts for flux saturation and the existence of a minimal dune size , has been achieved @xcite .",
    "this model consists of a system of continuum equations in two space dimensions which reproduce the shape of terrestrial dunes , the wind profile and the sand flux and provide excellent quantitative agreement with measurements @xcite .",
    "the dune model , which has been applied to study the interaction of dunes in a field @xcite and the formation of parabolic dunes in the presence of vegetation @xcite , has become a powerful tool in the investigation of the large timescale processes involved in the formation of desert and coastal landscapes .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply the dune model to investigate whether dunes could be formed on the present mars .",
    "our aim to reproduce the shape of martian dunes using the present martian atmospheric conditions .",
    "the dune model has parameters of atmosphere , wind and sand , many of which are known for mars and can be therefore used to solve the model equations . while most of the quantities controlling saltation can be calculated from the atmospheric density @xmath4 , gravity @xmath5 , air viscosity @xmath6 and from the grain diameter @xmath7 , there is one unknown quantity , which is related to the intensity of the martian splash and must be determined from simulations .",
    "moreover , the wind velocity that formed martian dunes is also a parameter : it must be estimated from comparison with the shape of the dunes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the dune model .",
    "the main equations are presented , as well as the relations used to calculate the microscopic quantities governing saltation on mars . in section [ sec : saltation ] we calculate the average grain velocities , mean saltation height and sand flux on mars from the known parameters , and the results are compared with wind tunnel predictions and with calculation results for saltation transport on earth .",
    "dunes on mars are calculated in section [ sec : dunes ] .",
    "we begin with the simplest dune form , which is the barchan dune .",
    "first , we study the shape of the barchan dunes in the arkhangelsky crater .",
    "we find an equation for the rate at which grains enter saltation , which can be used in the calculations of dunes under different atmospheric conditions .",
    "we then estimate the wind velocity on mars and predict the migration velocity of martian barchans .",
    "next , we study the shape of martian bimodal sand dunes and find an estimate for the timescale of changes in wind regimes on mars .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the dune model combines an analytical description of the average turbulent wind velocity field above the dune with a continuum saltation model which allows for saturation transients in the sand flux . in the model ,",
    "avalanches on the slip face and flow separation at the dune lee are also taken into account . here",
    "we give a brief presentation of the model and refer to sauermann _",
    "_ @xcite and schwmmle and herrmann @xcite for the extensive derivation of the saltation transport equations .",
    "in the turbulent boundary layer , where sand transport takes place , the velocity of the wind @xmath8 increases logarithmically with height @xmath9 above the flat ground : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the von krmn constant , @xmath12 is the wind shear velocity , which is used to define the shear stress @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the aerodynamic roughness . @xmath12 and @xmath14 are two independent variables that can be determined from measurements of the wind velocity at different heights , as done for instance in the mars pathfinder lander wind sock experiment @xcite .",
    "the aerodynamic roughness @xmath14 is larger than the surface roughness of the undisturbed sand bed , @xmath15 , which is of the order of a few tens of microns and is due to the microscopic fluctuations of the sand bed when the grains are at rest @xcite .",

    "indeed , the wind velocity may even decrease to values lower than @xmath35 , and still saltation can be sustained , once initiated .",
    "this is because the splash is the most important mechanism of sand entrainment during saltation @xcite . the wind strength , however , can not be lower than the impact threshold velocity @xmath37 , which defines the threshold shear stress @xmath38 and is around @xmath39 of @xmath35 .",
    "saltation ceases if @xmath40 , and therefore the impact threshold velocity is the essential threshold velocity for aeolian sand transport .",
    "the wind shear velocity computed above is used to calculate the sand flux with the model derived in sauermann _",
    "the fundamental idea of the model is to consider the bed - load as a thin fluid - like granular layer on top of an immobile sand bed .",
    "the sand bed represents an open system which can exchange grains with the moving saltation layer , for which the erosion rate @xmath41 at any position ( @xmath42 ) represents a source term .",
    "mass conservation yields that the local change in the flux balances the erosion rate : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density of grains in the saltation layer , and @xmath45 is the average local velocity of the saltating grains , whereas stationary condition has been assumed ( @xmath46 ) since the time scale of the surface evolution is several orders of magnitude larger than the typical values of transient time of the saltation flux .",
    "the erosion rate is the difference between the vertical flux of ejected grains and the vertical flux @xmath47 of grains impacting onto the bed : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the average number of splashed grains . the vertical flux @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the average saltation length .",
    "due to the multiplicative process inherent in the splash events , the number of saltating grains first increases exponentially .",
    "however , the `` feedback effect '' leads to a decrease of the momentum of the air as the population of grains increases .",
    "at saturation , the air shear stress @xmath53 decreases to the threshold @xmath54 , while the flux of grains increases to its maximum value .",

    "it is interesting to notice that our calculations provide a different explanation for the formation of the martian dune field in fig .",
    "[ fig : moc_images]e than that proposed by bourke @xcite .",
    "we found that the field in fig .",
    "[ fig : moc_images]e consists of linear dunes which are decaying into barchans , while bourke @xcite suggested an alternative view : the small barchans would merge to form the linear dunes .    the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : mars_bimodal_dunes ] provide evidence for bimodal wind regimes on mars .",
    "we find that a variety of martian dune forms which appear in craters and which develop on bedrock have been formed by a wind whose direction alternates between two main orientations .",
    "we conclude that if more sand were available in those places , longitudinal dunes would in fact appear as observed in terrestrial sand seas .",
    "the study of the shape of linear dunes is the subject of a future publication @xcite .",
    "again , the wind strength @xmath198 m@xmath1s used in the calculations must be interpreted as the representative value of shear velocity that is above the threshold for saltation and is responsible for the major changes of the surface @xcite . because martian winds are most of the time _",
    "below _ the threshold for saltation , we expect the timescale @xmath199 of the changes in wind directions to be in reality much larger than the values of @xmath183 ( a few days ) found in the calculations .",
    "we define as @xmath200 the fraction of time the wind strength is above the threshold for saltation . from the results of the calculations of barchans , this means that the martian @xmath12 is around @xmath201 m@xmath1s a fraction @xmath200 of time .",
    "we interpret this value of shear velocity as the representative wind friction speed associated with the gusts of aeolian activity that occur during the strongest dust storms on mars @xcite .",
    "further , the real timescale @xmath199 of the changes in wind direction is defined through the relation @xmath202 .",
    "let us assume that winds above the threshold on mars occur generally during @xmath203 s at intervals of @xmath204 years ( 2000 days or @xmath205 s ) @xcite , i.e. @xmath206 . a characteristic time @xmath207 days means @xmath208 seconds .",
    "dividing @xmath183 by @xmath203 s , this characteristic time corresponds to @xmath209 gusts of saltation transport .",
    "the martian real time @xmath199 is @xmath210 therefore , the real time of oscillation of the wind direction on mars found from our calculations is of the order of @xmath211 years , where it has been assumed that martian saltation occurs as frequently as observed from the mars missions @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we have applied a well established dune model , which successfully reproduces the shape of terrestrial dunes measured in the field , to study dune formation on mars . in summary",
    ", we found that dunes observed in the images of mars could have been formed by the action of sand - moving winds that occur occasionally under the present atmospheric conditions of the red planet .",
    "below we give a list of the main conclusions :    * the quantities controlling martian saltation , as the average grain velocity , mean saltation height and saturated flux may vary in a significant manner depending on the location on mars .",
    "this is because local average values of martian surface pressure and temperature may be very different depending on the geographical location ; * from the shape of barchan dunes on mars , we found that the rate at which martian grains enter saltation is 10 times higher than on earth . the martian higher entrainment rate , which is a result of the larger splash events on mars , shortens the length of flux saturation and reduces the scale of dunes that is obtained if only the martian larger saltation length is considered @xcite ; * all dune shapes studied in this work could be reproduced with values of shear velocity that do not exceed @xmath212 m@xmath1s , independently of the location on mars .",
    "we interpret this value as the representative friction speed of sand - moving winds that occur during the strongest dust storms on mars ; * for the same value of relative wind velocity @xmath213 , barchans would move ten times faster on mars than on earth . however , the migration velocity of martian barchans is negligible because saltation transport in fact occurs only seldom on the present mars ; * we found martian dune shapes that have been formed by bimodal wind regimes .",
    "the timescale of changes in wind direction obtained in calculations is of the order of a few days .",
    "taking into account that winds transport sand on mars during some tens of seconds in intervals of a few years @xcite , this timescale is in reality of the order of @xmath214 terrestrial years .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a significant change in wind direction ( by @xmath215 or more ) is expected to occur after each extreme of the _ orbital _ cycle of mars , which is determined by the combined effect of the precession of its axis and the arrival at _ perihelion _ @xcite . because of precession of the martian axis , each pole of mars appears tilted to the sun in a cycle of @xmath216 years .",
    "now the latitude which `` looks '' toward the sun at perihelion is @xmath217s , but this `` subsolar latitude at perihelion '' ( slp ) migrates @xmath218 about the equator over a 51kyr time span @xcite .",
    "this orbital cycle is the most important one for the climate of mars , the hemisphere of the slp having short , hot summers , and being the one of the major dust storms activity . in @xmath219 years",
    ", it is the northern hemisphere that will be tilted to the sun .",
    "`` _ the large amounts of fine dust currently deposited in the northern hemisphere in regions such as tharsis , arabia , and elysium will be redistributed to the southern hemisphere _ '' @xcite .",
    "this half cycle of @xmath219 years is in fact well within the range of characteristic time @xmath220 years of bimodal winds found from our calculations of sand dunes on mars .    in comparison ,",
    "the timescale @xmath199 of changes in directions of bimodal winds in terrestrial dune fields is of the order of a few weeks or months . on earth ,",
    "linear dunes appear due to wind changes that occur _ seasonally _",
    "@xcite , since the fraction of time @xmath200 the wind friction speed @xmath12 is above the threshold @xmath37 is much larger than on mars @xcite . in this manner , we do not expect the wind changes due to precession of the earth s axis to play a major role for the shape of terrestrial bimodal sand dunes . on the other hand , martian winds that are not associated with the intense dust storms mentioned in the last paragraph are too weak to move sand .",
    "indeed , such weak winds are responsible for the appearance of dust devils that leave ephemeral marks on the surface of martian dunes @xcite , which appear unmobile .",
    "the shape of martian dunes could be only achieved with real wind and atmospheric conditions of the present mars because the entrainment rate of grains into saltation , which we found to be 10 times higher on mars than on earth , was incorporated in the model equations .",
    "in fact , it is well known from experiments that the splash events on mars are much larger than on earth due to the higher velocity of martian grains @xcite .",
    "what we have found in the calculations is the implication of the larger amount of splashed grains on mars for the flux saturation and formation of dunes .",
    "it would be interesting to make a full microscopic simulation for the saltation mechanism of mars similar to the one that was recently performed by almeida _",
