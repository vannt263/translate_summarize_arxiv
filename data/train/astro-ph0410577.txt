    "spectral - line emission from the oh ( 1720 mhz ) satellite transition @xmath2 in supernova remnants ( snr s ) was first observed by goss ( 1968 ) toward w28 .",
    "the maser nature of the emission was noted shortly thereafter along with the recognition that the 1720-mhz line emission , when observed in association with absorption in the other ground - state oh lines , requires a pump mechanism different than that used to explain region oh masers ( goss & robinson 1968 ; ball & staelin 1968 ; turner 1969 ; robinson , goss , & manchester 1970 ) .",
    "much later , observations of w28 by frail , goss , and slysh ( 1994 ) renewed the interest in the snr masers while also recognizing ( 1 ) the astrophysical diagnostic value of the masers association with molecular clouds and ( 2 ) the viability of the collisional pump suggested by elitzur ( 1976 ) to explain the level population inversion .",
    "subsequent studies and surveys ( yusef - zadeh et al .  2000 ; yusef - zadeh et al .  1999 ;",
    "koralesky et al .",
    "1998 ; green et al .  1997",
    "; frail et al .  1996 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "1996 ) have since observed approximately 200 galactic supernova remnants and found 22 remnants with associated oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser emission .",
    "observations support the premise that oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers occur where the shock front from a supernova explosion encounters a molecular cloud ( _ e.g_.  w28 : frail , goss , and slysh 1994 ; kes  78 : koralesky et al .  1998 ; 3c391 : frail et al .",
    "1996 ; w44 : wootten 1977 ) .",
    "in such interactions , a @xmath3-type ( non - dissociative ) shock can produce the relatively rare conditions ( @xmath4 , @xmath5  k , @xmath6 ) needed for the collisionally - pumped oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers ( elitzur 1976 ; wardle 1999 ; lockett , gauthier , & elitzur 1999 ; see also draine & mckee 1993 ) .",
    "the suggested temperature , density , and oh column of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) collisional pump are consistent with those determined from observation ( _ e.g_.  claussen et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter c97 ; hoffman et al .  2003a , hereafter h03 ) .",
    "furthermore , oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers are observed at the snr / molecular cloud interface where the shock front is edge - on , moving transversely across the plane of the sky ( _ e.g_.  reynoso & mangum 2000 ) .",
    "frail & mitchell ( 1998 ) and arikawa et al .  ( 1999 ) have examined the post - shock gas in w28 using observations of shocked co ( @xmath7 ) using the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "figure [ c97+co ] shows the good positional agreement between the oh masers , the shocked gas , and the limb of the synchrotron emission from the snr ( this agreement is discussed in  [ lin_disc ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic , transverse sizes of the masers have been the subject of several recent studies .",
    "indeed , the narrow - band maser emission does not permit simple multi - wavelength fitting of the scattering properties to the @xmath8 wavelength dependence expected of scattering due to the ionized interstellar medium at radio frequencies .",
    "claussen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that the angular scatter - broadening of the maser images in w28 is not significant based on studies of the angular scattering of an adjacent extragalactic source and the temporal broadening of a background pulsar .",
    "hoffman et al .",
    "( h03 ) observed the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in ic  443 near the galactic anticenter where interstellar scatter - broadening is expected to be negligible .",
    "conversely , yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in the direction of the galactic center to be appreciably scatter - broadened . both claussen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and h03 find that the observed sizes of the masers are consistent with those predicted from collisional pump theory ( @xmath9  cm , lockett et al .",
    "however , oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser observations using the vlba and merlin ( h03 ; brogan et al .  2003 ; claussen et al .  1999 , hereafter c99 )",
    "are not sensitive to the very extended ( 60 ) , `` face - on '' maser emission observed in w28 using the vla ( yusef - zadeh , wardle , & roberts 2003 , @xmath10  cm projected linear size for a distance @xmath11  kpc to the snr , velzquez et al .",
    "the current study will examine only the approximately 40 individual maser `` spots '' observed by c97 ( using the vla ) at the location where the shock front of w28 is viewed edge - on ( moving transversely across the sky ) .",
    "the maser region observed for this paper is about 1  pc in diameter compared with the approximately 30-pc diameter of the w28 snr ( fig .",
    "[ c97+co ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic angular size of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser spots ( on the order of 100  mas ) is a relatively problematic angular scale for observation with most existing instruments .",
    "radio interferometers with baselines on the order of 10  km in length do not resolve the maser emission and , furthermore , typically convolve several maser spots together within a large beam ( on the order of 1 ) .",
    "this `` spatial blending '' confuses both the angular and spectral character of the individual masers , preventing a determination of intrinsic emission properties .",
    "past high - angular - resolution studies have employed vlbi - baseline lengths on the order of 1000  km ( fringe spacings of approximately 30  mas ) .",
    "although oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers are known to have a compact core component ( c99 ; h03 ) , vlbi experiments typically `` resolve out '' most maser spots ( _ i.e_.  the observations are not sensitive to emission on 100-mas angular scales due to low correlated fringe visibility ) .",
    "however , the angular sensitivity of the merlin array ( baselines on the order of 100  km in length ) is well - matched to the angular scale of the masers .",
    "the minimum angular resolution of observations using merlin ( approximately 100  mas ) is sufficient to alleviate spatial blending .",
    "the largest angular scale sampled in observations using merlin ( approximately 3 ) is sufficient to recover all of the flux density of the masers .",
    "since the oh radical is paramagnetic , the polarization state of oh emission is strongly affected by the magnetic field in the maser gas ( compared with non - paramagnetic molecules such as h@xmath12co ) .",
    "indeed , circular - polarization studies of the zeeman splitting of oh spectral lines is a significant source of information about the interstellar magnetic field ( _ e.g_.  caswell 2004 ) .",
    "zeeman observations of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) maser emission in supernova remnants have provided estimates of the magnitude of the magnetic fields in supernova / molecular cloud interactions ( @xmath13  mg : c99 ; brogan et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter bfgt ) .",
    "also , observations of the linear polarization of the maser radiation can yield the orientation of the post - snr - shock magnetic field .",
    "however , the suggested theoretical conversion from observational parameters to the three - dimensional magnetic field geometry responsible for the observed maser polarization is not straightforward ( _ e.g_.  elitzur 1998 ; watson & wyld 2001 , hereafter ww01 ; gray 2003 ) . nevertheless , measurement of the following three observational polarization parameters is a necessary step toward understanding the physics of the maser emission : ( 1 ) the magnitude of the level splitting due to the zeeman effect , ( 2 ) the position angle @xmath14 of the linear polarization , and ( 3 ) the fractional linear polarization @xmath15 of the maser radiation ( where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are stokes parameters ) .    to date , all of the full - polarization studies of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers were completed by c97 and bfgt using the vla .",
    "since much of the prevailing theory pertinent to these masers was published after the c97 paper ( elitzur 1998 ; lockett , gauthier , & elitzur 1999 ; wardle 1999 ) , bfgt contains a thorough discussion of the theories and their implications for both the c97 and bfgt data .",
    "the interpretation of many of the results of the current paper also rely on bfgt .",
    "however , due to the insufficient spectral and angular resolution of the vla observations presented in c97 and bfgt , the theoretical suggestions presented by bfgt could not be confidently constrained using the data available at the time .",
    "indeed , the observational hurdle currently confronting oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr maser studies is the acquisition of full linear- and circular - polarimetry of resolved maser sources . the purpose of the current study is to observe a large sample of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers with spectral and angular resolution sufficient to apply more definitively the wealth of maser polarization theory discussed by bfgt .",
    "the w28 snr is chosen for this purpose because of the large number of masers ( approximately 40 ) .",
    "this paper presents full polarization observations of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers in w28 made using the multi - element radio linked interferometry network ( merlin ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the nrao .",
    "this paper will use the source numbering convention of claussen et al .",
    "( c97 table  1 ) .",
    "the w28 masers were observed on 29 and 31 january 2002 using the merlin radio telescope of jodrell bank observatory for a total of approximately 8 hours .",
    "the observations were centered on a doppler velocity of @xmath19  km  s@xmath20  for a line rest frequency of 1720.52998  mhz .",
    "seven antennas were used ; the mark ii and lovell telescopes at jodrell bank , the 32  m antenna at cambridge , and the 25  m dishes at knockin , darnhall , tabley , and defford .",
    "the very short ( @xmath21  m ) mark ii - lovell baseline is not used .",
    "the baseline lengths of merlin range from 11  km to 217  km ; the array is not sensitive to angular scales larger than 33 .",
    "the antennas have right- ( r ) and left- ( l ) circularly polarized feeds from which rr , ll , rl , & lr cross - correlations were formed .",
    "the correlator produced 256 spectral channels across 250  khz ( 44  km  s@xmath20 ) .",
    "the spectra were hanning - smoothed off - line yielding a velocity resolution of 0.36  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "the visibilities were integrated for 8.0  s.    the absolute amplitude calibration is based on observations of 3c286 .",
    "the bandpasses were calibrated based on observations of 3c84 .",
    "the phases were calibrated using frequent observations at 14  mhz bandwidth of the source 1748 - 253 ( j1751 - 2524 ) , which has a flux density of 1.3  jy and a 1-@xmath22 positional uncertainty of 2.7  mas ( fomalont et al .",
    "the visibility phases and amplitudes were then ( self- ) calibrated using images of the bright ( approximately 70  jy ) f39 maser ( c97 ) .",
    "3c84 was observed at both 14  mhz and 256  khz bandwidth allowing bandwidth - dependent calibration to be transferred .",
    "the position angle of the linear polarization response of the antennas was determined from the observations of 3c286 and 1748 - 253 .",
    "the rms noise in the final single - channel images is 8  mjy  beam@xmath20 , in agreement with expected instrumental behavior .",
    "the fwhm synthesized beam of the images is @xmath23  mas at a position angle @xmath24 .",
    "the tracking position during the observations was the position of the f39 maser determined from vlba observations by c99 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "since the primary beam of the largest merlin antenna ( the 76  m lovell ) is approximately 10 , only the e and f region masers are within the primary beam of the array and the amplitude of the a , b , c , and d region masers are attenuated ( the a region lies in a sidelobe of the primary beam of the lovell antenna ) . also , the relatively large angular distance from the phase tracking center to the outlying maser regions resulted in decreased amplitude due to decoherent fringe visibility averaging during on - line integration ( ` time smearing ' ; see thompson 1999 ) .",
    "these amplitude degradations have been corrected for the few masers detected in the outlying regions .",
    "we also observed the w28 oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers on 26 september , 7 and 14 october 2002 and 24 february , 14 and 24 march 2003 with the ten antennas of the vlba plus one antenna of the vla ( y1 ) for approximately 30  hours .",
    "the antennas have right- ( r ) and left- ( l ) circularly polarized feeds from which rr , ll , rl , & lr cross - correlations were formed .",
    "the correlator produced 128 spectral channels across a 62.5  khz ( 11  km  s@xmath20 ) band yielding a 0.09  km  s@xmath20  velocity channel spacing .",
    "the spectra were off - line hanning - smoothed yielding a velocity resolution of 0.18  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "two overlapping observing bands were used , centered on @xmath27  km  s@xmath20  and @xmath28  km  s@xmath20  in order to cover the 16  km  s@xmath20  range over which the maser are observed .",
    "the visibilities were integrated for 4.7  s.    the amplitude scale is set using online system temperature monitoring and _ a priori _ antenna gain measurements .",
    "bandpass responses and station delays were found from observations of 3c345 .",
    "the visibility phases and amplitudes were then ( self- ) calibrated using images of the bright ( approximately 70  jy ) f39 maser ( c97 ) .",
    "the position angle of the linear polarization response of the antennas is determined from observations of 3c286 and j1751 + 0939 .",
    "the baseline lengths of the vlba+y1 array range from 52  km to 8611  km ; the array is not sensitive to angular scales larger than 070 .",
    "the correlated field of view with respect to the phase - tracking position is @xmath29 .",
    "thus , in order to observe all of the w28 masers , two array - pointing positions and eight correlator - tracking positions were used , listed in table  1 .",
    "the synthesized beam of the resulting images is @xmath30  mas at a position angle of @xmath31 .",
    "the rms noise in the final single - channel images is 30  mjy  beam@xmath20 , in agreement with expected values .",
    "all data reduction and imaging was performed with the aips software package .",
    "figures  [ moment0 ] , [ moment0 - 3 ] , and [ moment0 - 1 ] show the line - integrated ( zeroth - moment ) merlin images of 19 of the masers .",
    "the majority of maser detections are in the e and f maser regions ; the merlin observations contain only three detections outside of regions e and f and the vlba observations contain no detections outside of regions e and f. these detection rates are consistent with expectations based on previous observations . of the 41 maser spots detected in w28 by c97 using the vla , 23 were observed to have intensities greater than 1  jy  beam@xmath20 .",
    "the merlin observations contain detections of 21 of these 23 masers ; the only exceptions are the a2 and e32 masers .",
    "even though the a maser region lies in a sidelobe of the lovell primary beam , the a3 maser was detected .",
    "however , since its amplitude is very uncertain we will not discuss it further .",
    "in addition , the merlin observations indicate that there are multiple angular components in the f20 and f39 masers ( figs .",
    "[ moment0 ] , [ moment0 - 3 ] ) .",
    "figures [ vlba_f39a ] and [ vlba_f39c ] show the peak - channel images of the f39a and f39c masers from the vlba+y1 observations .",
    "tables [ mersizes ] and [ vlbasizes ] list the deconvolved angular sizes and total flux densities observed using merlin and the vlba . the f40 maser is detected on only the y1-pt baseline ( vla - pie town , 52  km station separation , 700  mas fringe spacing ) and y1-la baseline ( vla - los alamos , 226  km , 150  mas ) in the vlba+y1 observations and was not imaged . the observed size of the f40 maser in the vlba data set is estimated to be @xmath32  mas from the two fringe visibilities .",
    "four of the 28 masers detected using merlin are detected using the vlba+y1 ( e24 , f39a , f39c , and f40 ) for a detection rate of approximately 15% . using the vlba+y1 , h03 were able to image one of the five masers in ic  443 that is detected using merlin for a comparable detection rate of approximately 20% .",
    "the deconvolved sizes of the merlin maser images are in the range 90 to 350  mas ( 225 to 875  au projected linear size ) . compact cores with deconvolved sizes of 20  mas ( 50  au ) are apparent in the vlba images .",
    "these findings are consistent with theoretical expectations ( lockett et al .",
    "1999 ; wardle 1999 ) and previous observations ( c99 ; h03 ) . also , the total flux density of the masers as measured from the merlin images is in good agreement with the vla data of c97 , indicating that none of the maser emission is resolved out using merlin .",
    "the vlba images of the f39a and f39c maser emission cores contain approximately 75% of the flux density detected in observations using the vla and merlin , consistent with previous observations ( c99 ; h03 ) .",
    "the _ absolute _ positions in the current vlba data have a 3-@xmath22 uncertainty of about 100  mas since the observations did not include an astrometric - quality phase calibrator ( _ e.g_. , reid 1999 ) . however , the current merlin observations were phase - referenced to the calibrator 1748 - 253 and have a 1-@xmath22 absolute position uncertainty of about 5  mas .",
    "the vlba observations of c99 were also phase - referenced to 1748 - 253 and have a 1-@xmath22 absolute position uncertainty of 3  mas .",
    "the current maser positions measured using merlin are consistent with the positions measured by c99 . for a distance to the masers of 2.5  kpc ( velzquez et al .",
    "2002 ) , the agreement between the c99 observations in 1997 may and the current merlin observations in 2002 january implies a 3-@xmath22 upper limit of 60  km  s@xmath20  on the transverse speed of the masers .",
    "draine , roberge , & dalgarno ( 1983 ) suggest speeds in the range @xmath33  km  s@xmath20  ( @xmath34 ) for the shocks in which oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers occur ( see h03 for a complete discussion of the potential for proper motion in oh snr masers ) .",
    "since the current observations are not sensitive to the proper motions that may have occurred since the c99 observations ( a few milliarcseconds ) , we adopt the c99 position for the f39a maser in this paper .",
    "the _ relative _ positions of the masers to the f39a maser are limited only by the signal - to - noise ratio and the angular resolution of the observations , not by the initial phase calibration .",
    "for example , the current vlba observation of the f39c maser ( 40:1 signal - to - noise , 15  mas beam ) has a 1-@xmath22 relative position uncertainty of @xmath35  mas with respect to the f39a maser position .",
    "furthermore , the relative separation of the two main peaks in the current vlba images of the f39a ( @xmath36  mas , 70  au ) and f39c ( @xmath37  mas , 100  au ) masers are consistent with the vlba observations by c99 , indicating a 1-@xmath22 upper limit on the relative motion among the multiple maser emission cores of less than 1  mas ( 2.5  au ; a relative transverse velocity @xmath38  km  s@xmath20 ) .",

    "all line profiles were fitted using the gipsygipsy/. ] software package .",
    "typical linewidths are slightly less than 1  km  s@xmath20 , with values measured using the vlba being smaller ( narrower ) than values measured using merlin ( the trend of observed line width decreasing with beam size is observed for many maser species , _",

    "the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in w28 were imaged separately in right - circular polarization ( rcp , using rr cross - correlations ) and left - circular polarization ( lcp , using ll cross - correlations ) .",
    "although the rcp and lcp images of a given maser are coincident in sky position and spectral channel ( the instrumental channel separation is approximately 0.2  km  s@xmath20 ,  2 ) , the gaussians fitted to the rcp and lcp line profiles have different center velocities ( separated by approximately 0.07  km  s@xmath20 ) .",
    "we assume that the relative displacement of the rcp and lcp lines is due to zeeman level - splitting of the maser transition in a magnetic field .",
    "both the merlin and vlba observations indicate resolved zeeman - splitting in this manner .",
    "the spectral line observations of the masers in this data set have both high signal - to - noise ( @xmath512500:1 for the f39a maser in the merlin data ) and well - resolved spectral lines ( the lines span about 15 spectral channels ) .",
    "for these relatively high - confidence detections , the uncertainty in the measurement of the relative displacement of the fitted rcp and lcp line centers is approximately @xmath52 .",
    "also , the symmetric fit - residuals discussed in  4.2 do not affect the confidence with which the central velocity is fitted .",
    "the velocity difference is converted to magnetic field using the relationship @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the magnetic field measured using rcp and lcp line profiles and @xmath55 is the zeeman splitting coefficient ( _ e.g_.  fish et al .",

    "the results presented in  3.3.1 represent the first observation of resolved zeeman splitting in oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers .",
    "although these resolved - zeeman - splitting results already provide complete information about the magnetic field strength , we present the following stokes v fitting results as well since previous zeeman analyses of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers have employed the fitting method described in this section .",
    "zeeman analyses are based upon the degree to which the zeeman components have been separated in frequency from the resonance frequency of the line transition .",
    "the separation may be parameterized with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the zeeman frequency separation of the split substates and @xmath63 is the doppler - broadened width of the maser line , typically the same as the width of the saturated stokes @xmath18 maser line profile ( cf .",

    "the @xmath67 term in equation  [ zeemap ] represents the symmetrical component of the stokes @xmath60 profile .",
    "the fitted sign and magnitude of @xmath68 is consistent with instrumental `` leakage '' of stokes @xmath18 into stokes @xmath60 ( _ e.g_.  crutcher et al .",
    "1975 ) ; in the current data @xmath68 does not represent an intrinsic property of the maser radiation .",
    "for example , the fits to the merlin data for the f39a and e24 masers yield @xmath69% and @xmath70% , respectively , consistent with the expected instrumental leakage ( 0.3% ) of the merlin array . however , we investigated whether @xmath68 may represent an intrinsic property of the maser emission . in the case of unsaturated amplification , a symmetric component of stokes @xmath60",
    "is expected ( _ e.g_.  vlemmings , diamond , & van langevelde 2002 ) but must be accompanied by a narrowing of @xmath71 with respect to stokes @xmath60 , an effect which is not observed in the current data ( also see bfgt ) .",
    "therefore , we have subtracted the @xmath67 term from the data and do not consider it in the current analysis .    the conversion between the fit parameter @xmath72 and the magnetic field strength has differing theoretical interpretations , to be discussed in  [ circ_disc ] . since many of the relevant current theories suggest that @xmath72 depends on @xmath73 , the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field , we denote the magnetic field strength determined from equation [ zeemap ] as @xmath74 , to distinguish it from @xmath75 which is measured as described in  3.3.1 . in this paper the values of the fitted parameter @xmath72 are related to the magnetic field @xmath74 using @xmath76 . note that the factor of @xmath77 is associated with the derivative of stokes @xmath18 since @xmath78 or @xmath79 ( in the case of equal amplification of both polarizations ) and @xmath80 . from table 6",
    "it is clear that the derived values of @xmath75 and @xmath74 are in good agreement .",

    "the improvement in the spectral and angular resolution from the c97 vla observations to the merlin observations has allowed a more reliable determination of the polarization properties of the line profiles .",
    "for example , the f20b and e27 masers are shown to have multiple spectral components based on the merlin observations ( table [ merpos ] ) .",

    "we do not understand this discrepancy .",
    "indeed , we have re - analyzed the data of c99 in exactly the same manner as we analyzed the new data presented here .",
    "in doing so , we obtain comparable results for the strength of the magnetic field fitted to both the the c99 data and the current data .",
    "for example , in our re - analysis , the magnetic field derived for the position marked f39b using the c99 data ( which is labeled f39ai in the current figure 5 ) is @xmath81  mg .",
    "this compares favorably with the field determined from the current data as @xmath82  mg . given the similar results from the re - analysis , we suggest that c99 had a conversion error in the calculation of their field strengths .",

    "figure [ vlba4pol ] shows two full - polarization spectra from the vlba observations .",
    "the percentage of linear polarization found for the w28 oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers ranges from approximately 5% to 20% .",
    "the exact values for each maser are also listed in tables [ merpol ] ( merlin ) and [ vlbapol ] ( vlba ) .    for every pair of masers in the merlin observations , the difference in polarization angles @xmath84",
    "has been plotted in figure [ deltachi ] as a function the relative separation of the masers .",
    "the histogram in the figure indicates that the majority of the masers ( approximately 55% ) have @xmath85 , with a secondary population ( approximately 30% ) near @xmath86 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ deltachi ] have a slope of zero , indicating that the difference in polarization angles is predominantly independent of maser separation .",
    "thus , the masers have comparable polarization angles throughout the approximately 2 arcminutes spanned by the e and f maser regions .    the value for @xmath87 listed in tables [ merpol ] and [ vlbapol ] is the observed change in polarization angle across the maser line profile .",

    "this result is discussed in  [ lin_prof_disc ] .",
    "the values of @xmath14 listed in the tables and figures are the values at the center of the line .",
    "as described in  1 , previous oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers studies were based on arcsecond - resolution observations with instruments such as the vla ( _ e.g_.  bfgt ) . in the current paper , we describe merlin and vlba observations which have more favorable angular and spectral resolution . as expected , these new observations have sufficiently alleviated instrumental blending to permit reliable measurements of the intrinsic emission properties of the masers . however , in interpreting these results in this section of the paper , we must rely on the existing literature concerning theoretical investigations of the maser emission .    the theoretical investigations upon which our analyses are based may be grouped into three topics , listed here in order of decreasing consensus : ( 1 ) the population inversion of the 1720-mhz transition , ( 2 ) the degree of saturation of the maser gain process , and ( 3 ) the polarization of the maser emission due to the presence of a magnetic field in the maser gas .    in  4.1 , we discuss the relative location , size , and brightness of the w28 masers .",
    "in the ten years since the rediscovery of oh snr masers ( frail , goss , & slysh 1994 ) , there has been a successful convergence between observation and theory concerning the expected size and excitation process of oh snr masers ( h03 ; claussen et al .  2002 ; lockett et al .  1999 ; wardle 1999 ) . in this paper , we add further evidence of the agreement between theory and observation (  3.1 ) and describe some new results pertinent to the milliarcsecond scale of the current observations .    in  4.2",
    ", we discuss the degree to which the masers are saturated . using two independent tests , we find that the masers must be at least partially saturated .",
    "however , many of the relevant maser polarization theories depend sensitively on the exact degree of maser saturation , which we are unable to accurately constrain .    in   4.3 , 4.4 , and 4.5",
    ", we compare the observed polarization properties with existing maser theories , including new work since this this topic was reviewed by bfgt ( e.g. ww01 ; gray 2003 ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that all of these theories employ two limits : either @xmath65 ( typical of the thermal zeeman case ) or @xmath88 ( fully resolved zeeman splitting typical of masers found in star forming regions ) that may render them inapplicable to our specific case where @xmath64 . for the time being we are stuck with this ambiguity , but hope that these observational data will spark interest in a theoretical study appropriate to the snr oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser regime .",
    "thus , the `` @xmath89 limit '' caveat imposed by the currently available theories should be kept in mind throughout these sections .",
    "observations which span a wide range of spatial scales suggest that the oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers exhibit both ( 1 ) a large region ( 500 - 1000  au ) of relatively weak emission surrounding , in some cases , ( 2 ) multiple , closely - spaced ( on the order of 100  au ) , compact cores ( 50 - 100  au ) of emission ( c99 ; h03 ) . in general , radio interferometers such as the vla ( baseline lengths on the order of 10  km ) , merlin ( @xmath90  km ) , and vlba ( @xmath91  km ) are sensitive to different size - scale regimes of this emission morphology .",
    "the w28 snr , and oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr s in general , contain several physically distinct maser regions ( discerned using differing velocities , polarization properties , etc . )",
    "separated by angular distances of a few hundred milliarcseconds to several arcminutes .",
    "observations using the vla ( with beam sizes @xmath92 ) yield images in which several emission regions are blended into single image spots .",
    "observations using merlin ( with beam sizes of approximately 100  mas ) yield images in which every image feature represents a physically distinct region of maser emission ( tables [ mersizes ] , [ merpos ] , [ merpol ] ) .",
    "for example , figure  [ moment0 ] shows four masers in the f39 region with distinct velocities , zeeman profiles , and linear polarization properties ( tables [ circ ] & [ merpol ] ) at the position where observations using the vla indicate only one image feature for which the emission properties could not be determined ( c97 ) .",
    "observations at the position of a given merlin maser image using the vlba ( approximately 10-milliarcsecond angular resolution ) reveal multiple image peaks , just as merlin observations of a vla source reveal several image peaks .",
    "however , these image peaks observed using the vlba _ do not _ have different velocities ( on the scale of a line width ) nor different polarization properties ( see also c99 ; h03 ) .",
    "indeed , the multiple peaks in the vlba images are more likely due to inhomogeneities within a single region of maser emission than to several physically distinct maser regions coincident along the line of sight . for example",
    ", merlin observations at the position of f39 contain the f39a and f39c masers ( fig .",
    "[ moment0 ] ) .",
    "the velocities of the f39a and f39c masers are @xmath93  km  s@xmath20  and @xmath94  km  s@xmath20 , respectively ( table [ merpos ] ) .",
    "these velocities are separated by a few line widths and indicate a difference in systemic kinematics between the f39a and f39c regions .",
    "in contrast , the peaks observed in the vlba images ( fig .  [ vlba_f39a ] , [ vlba_f39c ] ) , f39ai  iii and f39ci  ii ( table [ vlbapos ] ) are separated by much less than one line width in velocity ( a separation of approximately 0.04  km  s@xmath20  compared with a line width of approximately 0.60  km  s@xmath20 ) . therefore , we conclude that the different peaks in the vlba images of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers are not dynamically distinct regions of maser gas , but are instead emission inhomogeneities within a single volume of maser gas .",
    "a critical element in the analysis of maser radiation is the degree to which the maser is saturated ( _ e.g_.  vlemmings et al .",
    "2002 ; ww01 ; elitzur 1998 ) .",
    "for the case of oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers we discuss two tests : degree of linear polarization and line profile shape .    in order for maser emission to possess linear polarization ,",
    "it is expected on theoretical grounds ( _ e.g_.  nedoluha & watson 1990 ) that the maser needs to be at least partially saturated .",
    "this expectation has been used as evidence for partial saturation in the case of the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in w28 , w44 , ic443 , and w51 , which all show linear polarization as observed using the vla ( c97 ; bfgt ) . in this paper ,",
    "the merlin observations contain 22 detections of linear polarization .",
    "furthermore , there are no non - detections of linear polarization with confidence higher than 3-@xmath22 .",
    "thus it seems likely that the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers are at least partially saturated .",
    "another test results from the fact that unsaturated maser emission is expected to deviate substantially from a pure gaussian profile ( see , for example , elitzur 1998 ) .",
    "watson , sarma , & singleton ( 2002 ) have examined the deviation of maser line shapes from gaussian .",
    "figure  [ resid ] shows the fitted gaussians and residuals to the e24 and f39a maser lines from the merlin data . in the watson et al .",
    "model , the gaussian deviation of the line profile is quantified using the two parameters @xmath95 ( defined in watson et al .",
    "2002 ) and kurtosis ( the normalized fourth central moment of a distribution : _",
    "e.g_.  abramowitz & stegun 1972 ) .",

    "therefore , the saturated regime of the maser polarization theories proposed by both watson et al .  and elitzur will be applied in the following discussion .",
    "the magnetic fields of the w28 masers have been estimated using two techniques : resolved - zeeman splitting and fitting to stokes @xmath60 .",
    "magnetic fields calculated directly from resolved zeeman splitting ( @xmath75 ) are generally thought not to depend on @xmath73 , and thus this technique measures the full magnetic field strength ( _ e.g_.  townes & schawlow 1955 ) .",
    "the fitting of the stokes @xmath60 profiles to obtain @xmath72 using equation [ zeemap ] (  3.3.2 ) is typically used for measuring the zeeman effect in thermal gas . in the thermal case , @xmath72 is proportional to @xmath97 , but as mentioned in  3.3.2 the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath73 for the maser case is uncertain . for the first time we are able to directly compare these two techniques .    for the maser case where",
    "@xmath65 , a number of studies have examined the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath73 for maser emission .",
    "nedoluha & watson ( 1992 ) and watson ( 2002 ) suggest that for unsaturated masers , the thermal interpretation ( _ i.e_.  @xmath98 ) is appropriate .",
    "however , as described in  4.2 , the snr oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers are likely at least partially saturated . in the case of a saturated maser ,",
    "the @xmath73 dependence is both more controversial and complex ; possibly depending on a geometrical term in addition to @xmath73 .",
    "here we only concentrate on the @xmath73 dependence .",
    "elitzur ( 1998 ) suggests that @xmath99 , while ww01 present numerical simulations that yield different results ( although without a mathematical expression it is difficult to express exactly how different ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath72 may be independent of @xmath73 in the @xmath64 case observed for the oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers ( m.  elitzur 2003 , private communication ) , in analogy with the @xmath88 maser case .",
    "figure 16 shows a plot of the derived @xmath75 versus @xmath74 values for each maser .",
    "it is clear from this plot and table 6 that @xmath100 to a high degree of coincidence .",
    "this strong correlation leads to only two viable alternatives for the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath73 for the snr oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers : ( 1 ) there is an as yet undiscovered @xmath73 dependence on @xmath72 measured from the resolved - zeeman - fitting case ( @xmath75 ) , such that this dependence is the same as that of the stokes-@xmath60 fitting case ( whatever it may be ) ; or ( 2 ) for the @xmath64 case applicable to snr oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers there is no appreciable @xmath73 dependence on @xmath72 .",
    "although we can not distinguish between the two , we suspect that option ( 2 ) is more likely .    also , it has been observed ( brogan et al .",
    "2003 ) that the magnetic fields in oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers measured using stokes fitting depend upon the angular resolution of the observations : smaller beam areas yield larger magnetic field measurements .",
    "this trend is also observed in other maser species ( _ e.g_.  h@xmath12o , sarma et al .",
    "the oh ( 1720  mhz ) snr masers in w28 show an increase in fitted magnetic field between vla ( c97 ) and merlin observations due to blending at vla scales .",
    "however , the magnetic field strengths fitted to the current merlin and vlba observations are in good agreement .",
    "that is , it appears that the merlin beam is sufficiently small to alleviate all suppression due to blending . indeed , since the image features in the vlba observations have comparable emission characteristics (  4.1 ) , it is not expected that an angular convolution of a vlba image using the merlin beam would result in a suppression of the fitted spectral parameters ( see sarma et al .",

    "( ww01 ) suggest that @xmath101 and @xmath14 depend upon @xmath73 , the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field ( see also a comparison of these models by gray [ 2003 ] ) . in the case of w28",
    ", the orientation of the magnetic field in the maser region may be independently constrained using existing observations of the synchrotron continuum radiation from the snr .",
    "furthermore , since the magnetic field is likely to be aligned parallel to the shocked snr / molecular cloud interface which creates the maser conditions ( _ e.g_.  balsara et al .",
    "2001 ) , a comparison between the polarization state of the masers and observations of the shocked environment in w28 is also possible .",
    "the linear polarization properties of the synchrotron emission from w28 on large angular scales ( 2  to 6 ) have been studied by a number of groups ( milne & wilson 1971 ; kundu & velusamy 1972 ; milne & dickel 1975 ; dickel & milne 1976 ; milne 1987 ; milne 1990 ) .",
    "these studies find that the position angle of the synchrotron linear polarization @xmath102 is quite constant at approximately 80along the eastern side of the remnant where the region e and f masers are located . since @xmath102 is perpendicular to the plane of sky orientation of the magnetic field ( _ e.g_.  rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , @xmath103 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath102 remains constant down to the size scales relevant to the maser emission of a few hundred milliarcseconds is essential to compare the two since no higher resolution synchrotron polarization studies exist .",
    "certainly on a few arcminute size scales the @xmath102 is quite uniform ( see for example dickel & milne 1976 ) , and also the @xmath104 is fairly uniform from maser to maser ( _ i.e_.  figures 13 and 14 ) .",
    "however , that this is an assumption should be borne in mind during the following discussion .    for all measurements of linear polarization percentage and position angle ,",
    "faraday depolarization and rotation are of concern . due to the continuous nature of synchrotron emission ,",
    "the above studies have been able to use the observed wavelength dependence of the polarization properties to correct for faraday rotation and estimate the depolarization . in particular , dickel & milne ( 1976 ) have made a careful study of faraday effects toward w28 ( albeit at @xmath105 sizescales ) .",
    "these authors do not find evidence for faraday rotation near the maser locations where the rotation measure is @xmath106 . at nearby locations ,",
    "not coincident with the masers ( approximately 2  to the east and west ) the @xmath107 rises to @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we view @xmath108 as a strict upper limit , but will assume @xmath106 for the remaining discussion .",
    "this assumption is limited by the fact that a value of @xmath107 in the direction of the masers in excess of approximately @xmath109 ( equivalent to a faraday rotation of the position angle by approximately 25 ) could invalidate the alignment comparisons made between the synchrotron and maser polarization which we base on @xmath110 .",
    "as discussed in bfgt stimulated maser emission can only be faraday depolarized along the gain length of the maser .",
    "the gain lengths and ionization fractions suggested for snr oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers are such that this effect must be small ( see bfgt for details ) .",
    "indeed , dickel & milne ( 1976 ) find that the synchrotron depolarization toward the e and f maser locations is only 3% .",

    "the polarization properties of the masers are observed to change as a function of velocity within the profile , indicating small ( approximately 10 ) changes in the magnetic field orientation within the maser gas .",
    "using theoretical models , the angle between the line - of - sight and the magnetic field vector is inferred to be @xmath116 .",
