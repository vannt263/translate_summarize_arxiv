    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are mature standardised candles .",
    "intrinsic dispersion of the peak absolute magnitude can be minimised to the level of @xmath6 magnitude or even smaller , and can be accurately used as a cosmological distance indicator @xcite .",
    "however , this standardisation generally requires a non - standard extinction law , i.e. , @xmath7 , as opposed to the typical galactic value of @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that the properties of dust in sn ia host galaxies may be systematically different from those in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that multiple _",
    "scatterings _ of sn photons on circumstellar ( cs ) dust may explain the non - standard nature of the reddening law @xcite . despite the implications that have been discussed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , researchers have yet to find a smoking gun to test this hypothesis , apart from the various model predictions for optical wavelengths @xcite . this interpretation is also associated with as yet unclarified progenitor evolution , through the dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) and high mass loss rate that would be required .",
    "qualitatively , the scenario favours a so - called single - degenerate model ( i.e. , a pair consisting of a c+o white dwarf and a non - degenerate star ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which should create a relatively dense ( or ` dirty ' ) cs environment .    in this paper , we examine the effects of _ re - emission _ of sn photons for infrared ( ir ) wavelengths . while the _ ` scattering ' _ must be accompanied by _ `",
    "absorption and re - emission ' _ ( a cs dust echo ) , this process has not been examined with respect to the cs environment around sne ia ( with the exception of recent work that focused on the mid- and far - ir ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in  2 , we develop a simple echo model for cs dust heated by sn photons . in  3 ,",
    "we apply the method to observed nir sn ia samples .",
    "we place both conservative and deeper limits for the amount of cs dust under different assumptions . in  4 , we discuss the effects of different types of cs dust species , as well as future observational strategies for a better constraint on the amount of cs dust and the environment .",
    "the paper is closed in  5 with conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present our model of cs dust echoes .",
    "we restrict the model to absorption and re - emission processes , not including scattering .",
    "this is justified because , ( 1 ) given that the spectral peak of the sn light lies at optical wavelengths , the contribution of the scattered sn light at nir - ir wavelengths is very small , compared to that of thermal emission from cs dust , and ( 2 ) in the distribution of cs dust of interest in this paper , further scattering of the re - emitted nir / ir photons is negligible . while computational methods for an echo from spherically distributed cs dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and further from aspherically distributed cs dust ( especially for modelling the light echo from sn 1987a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been developed , we assume for the sake of simplicity that the distribution of cs dust is represented by an infinitely thin shell located at radius @xmath9 from the centre of an explosion .",
    "the thin - shell approximation further simplifies the computation as shown below .",
    "furthermore , in providing an upper limit for the amount of cs dust _ as a function of _ @xmath9 , the thin - shell approximation basically provides the most conservative limit , as any spherically symmetric distribution can be described as a convolution of different shells .",
    "namely , if one adds another shell at @xmath10 , that is different from @xmath9 for which the constraint is considered , then this additional shell will increase the predicted flux without contributing to the cs dust mass at @xmath9 ; therefore , the upper limit on this cs dust mass should be reduced ( i.e. , the predicted flux must be below observations ) .",
    "let us first consider a situation in which we observe a dust shell with temperature @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angle between the observer s line of sight and a direction vector pointing from the shell centre ( i.e. , the explosion centre ) to the position of the volume element within the shell under consideration .",
    "then , the luminosity of the thermal emission from dust is given as follows :    @xmath14    here , @xmath15 is the absorbing opacity of the dust at frequency @xmath16 .",
    "it is specified by the dust properties , which are assumed to be uniform within the shell .",
    "furthermore , the shell is assumed to have uniform density ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the above expression can be converted into time - dependent luminosity by introducing @xmath18 ( the time since the explosion , measured in the observer s frame ) and @xmath19 ( observer - frame time when the light was emitted from a given volume element at @xmath13 as observed at time @xmath18 ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by the following : @xmath20 combining eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we obtain the following expression for the echo luminosity at time @xmath18 : @xmath21    the temperature evolution of the cs dust at time @xmath18 , under radiative equilibrium with an incoming sn flux , @xmath22 , is given by @xmath23 this equation provides @xmath24 once the sn flux evolution is specified . under the condition considered in this paper ,",
    "the photon - dust collision time scale is shorter than the cooling time scale of the dust by thermal radiation .",
    "therefore , stochastic heating is negligible , and we can assume that virtually all of the dust particles have a temperature determined by radiative equilibrium .",
    "we first compute @xmath24 for a given @xmath9 using the above equation . for the sn flux",
    ", we use the hsiao template spectra as an input @xcite . for the dust opacity",
    ", we use the lmc - like dust properties as our fiducial model ; specifically , we adopt the opacity from @xmath25 to @xmath26 from @xcite so as to be consistent with the proposed cs scattering model .",
    "we extend the opacity toward the blue ( beyond @xmath25 ) and red ( beyond @xmath27 ) , assuming slopes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "then the evolution of @xmath24 is used as an input in the computations of echo luminosity and multi - band light curves .",
    "because the incoming sn light peaks in optical wavelengths , and because the dust temperature under the situation examined in this paper is determined by the opacity in the nir wavelength , the treatment of the opacity below the @xmath25-band and above the @xmath26-band does not substantially affect our results . to check this , we performed two additional test calculations : one having a slope of @xmath30 below the @xmath25-band and the other having a slope of @xmath31 above the @xmath27-band for our reference lmc dust model ; these models are unrealistically steep and flat , respectively , and thus provide a conservative measure of the uncertainty for the treatment of different slopes .",
    "the difference between the reference model and the one using the different slopes ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) is larger for a model with a larger @xmath9 .",
    "for the typical maximum distance for which a meaningful constraint is placed at different bands ( see  3 ) , the difference in the echo magnitude is given by @xmath35 mag ( for 0.03 pc ) , @xmath36 mag ( for 0.3 pc ) , and @xmath37 mag ( 1 pc ) for the different slope below the @xmath25-band .",
    "for the different slope above the @xmath26-band , @xmath38 mag ( for 0.03 pc ) , @xmath39 mag ( for 0.3 pc ) , and @xmath40 mag ( for 1 pc ) .",
    "therefore , in the worst - case scenario , our echo luminosity constraint ( and , thus , the dust mass ) could have an uncertainty factor of 5 ; however , in most cases the uncertainty would be much smaller than this .",
    "a further discussion of the dust properties is given in  4.1 .",
    "the resulting echo luminosity , as computed above , is for unobscured luminosity .",
    "we now consider the optical depth within the shell .",
    "the average optical depth is computed as @xmath41 ; then the nir echo luminosity is dimmed by this amount of absorption .",
    "the same procedure is adopted for the model with a different geometry ( see below ) .",
    "the csm around an sn ia may be confined within the equatorial plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore we also consider a torus / ring - like structure , again under the infinitely thin assumption in the radial direction .",
    "we denote @xmath42 as the opening angle of the ring , as measured from the equatorial direction .",
    "while it is possible to derive general expressions for an arbitrary viewing direction , hereafter , we focus on two extreme cases : pole - on and edge - on viewing .    for an observer sitting at the pole - on position ,",
    "the echo luminosity is expressed as follows : @xmath43 if @xmath44 , then the integral is set to zero .    to be an explanation for the non - standard extinction law requires @xmath45 cm , to introduce the effect of scattered photons around the maximum light",
    "an observer in the equatorial direction does not have this constraint .",
    "we note that both situations should be considered simultaneously , because there should be roughly an equal number of edge - on and pole - on counterparts ( depending on @xmath42 ) , if we adopt the ring - like geometry . finally , the echo luminosity arising from the same configuration , but viewed edge - on , is given as follows .",
    "@xmath46 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      another interesting possibility for the cs dust distribution is a bipolar morphology , i.e. , a pair of blobs / jets , as inferred for some novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we also consider a pair of bipolar blobs for the distribution of the cs dust , again under the infinitely thin assumption in the radial direction .",
    "we denote @xmath42 as the opening angle subtended by each blob , as measured from the polar direction .    for an observer sitting at the pole - on position ,",
    "the echo luminosity is expressed as follows : @xmath47 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the echo luminosity arising from the same configuration , but viewed edge - on , is given as @xmath48 similar to the case of the pole - on observer for the ring - like cs dust distribution , a constraint is placed on the cs dust radius if the multiple scattering model is to account for the non - standard extinction law . for the edge - on observer of the bipolar blob geometry , the cs dust radius must satisfy @xmath45 cm to introduce the scattered photon effect around the maximum light .",
    "this constraint does not apply to the pole - on observer ; however , both situations ( pole - on and edge - on ) should be considered simultaneously , following the same argument given for the ring - like geometry .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of @xmath49 and the predicted nir ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath26 ) light curves for different values of @xmath9 and for a fixed value of @xmath12 ( @xmath52 ) ; for the light curves , only the shell model is shown .",
    "the evolution of @xmath49 closely follows the optical light curve of sn ia . for @xmath53 pc",
    ", the peak temperature exceeds @xmath54k ; therefore , the dust may well have evaporated , depending on the nature of the cs dust . in such a case , essentially there should be neither scattering nor thermal emission from the cs dust .",
    "therefore , no constraint can be obtained regarding the amount of pre - existing cs dust , _ and _ the cs dust can not be an origin of the non - standard extinction law toward sne ia .",
    "the effects of different geometries are demonstrated in fig .",
    "2 ; light curves are shown for the shell csm , pole - on and edge - on views for a ring - like csm with @xmath55 , and pole - on and edge - on views for bipolar blobs with @xmath56 . throughout this paper , we consider these geometry types for the cs dust distribution , while adopting the shell model as our fiducial model .",
    "the light curve evolution is similar in various nir bands ; its time scale is basically determined by the travelling time of light , and thus the cs dust at larger @xmath9 results in a longer - lived , fainter nir echo . for small @xmath9 ,",
    "the travelling time of light is shorter than the time scale of the sn light curve evolution ; thus in this case , the light curve reflects the sn light curve evolution , and the echo light curve evolution traces the decreasing temperature of the cs dust as a function of time . on the other hand , for large @xmath9 , the travelling time of light far exceeds the sn light curve evolution time scale ; therefore , the temperature evolution has little influence on the shape of the light curve .",
    "emission at longer wavelengths is stronger for larger @xmath9 , which stems from smaller @xmath49 for larger @xmath9 . as such , the peak wavelength in the thermal emission is shorter than the @xmath50-band for smaller @xmath9 , while it is even longer than the @xmath26-band pass for larger @xmath9 .",
    "figure 3 shows examples of the constraint on the amount of cs dust using the shell model . without the dust echo , nir luminosities of sne",
    "are powered by radioactive decay of @xmath57co and subsequent thermalisation ; the nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) roughly follows a blackbody of @xmath58 k in the early photospheric phase ( @xmath59 days ) , while the sed reflects the forbidden lines of fe - peak elements in late nebular phases ( @xmath60 days ) . in any case , a conservative upper limit on the cs dust mass is obtained by the condition that the resulting echo luminosity can not exceed the observation at any epochs . as the echo luminosity is proportional to @xmath12 in the optically thin regime , for a given @xmath9 , one can derive a maximally allowed value for @xmath12 . note that this is not a fit to the observed light curve",
    " the echo light curve model for small @xmath9 resembles the observed light curve to some extent , but this is because the echo evolution follows the sn evolution for small @xmath9 ( see above ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "3 shows how an early - phase light curve ( up to @xmath61 days since the @xmath62-band maximum ) can be used to constrain the amount of cs dust .",
    "generally , the early phase data provide a strong constraint on @xmath12 for small @xmath9 , but lose diagnostic power for cs dust at large @xmath9 .",
    "the model prediction for small @xmath9 is similar for different bands ; typically the @xmath50-band provides the deepest limit , thanks to its extensive coverage within the nir .",
    "we note that the @xmath63-band , which typically has much better coverage than the @xmath50-band , is not so useful for this purpose , as the wavelength of the thermal emission peak is longer than that of the @xmath63-band .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the other extreme within the nir wavelengths , namely a constraint obtained through late - time photometry in the @xmath26-band . such an observation can provide a constraint on the cs dust at large @xmath9 , up to @xmath64 pc .                by applying different models ( i.e. , with a different @xmath9 and geometry ) to the available , observed , multi - band light curves , a constraint can be obtained for @xmath12 as a function of @xmath9 for each sn",
    "the light curves for different bands provide mutually independent upper limits ; we adopted the strongest limit among @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath26 . the result is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the method was applied to a ` typical nir observation ' using the csp sample , sn 2006x , as an example of very intensively observed early - phase light curves , including the @xmath26-band and extending to a relatively late epoch ; also shown are sne 1998bu , 2000cx , 2001el , 2003du , and 2003hv , for which nir late - phase ( @xmath64 year ) magnitudes are available .",
    "it is seen that generally the strongest constraints are obtained through the @xmath50 or @xmath51-band data for the cs dust at @xmath65 pc , and through the @xmath26-band at @xmath66 pc .",
    "figure 4 also contains lines indicating various physical situations .",
    "the thick solid lines indicate the absorptive optical depth in the @xmath62-band , which gives indication of the likelihood that the cs dust is the origin of the non - standard extinction law ( i.e. , an optical depth of an order unity is required ) .",
    "the thin solid lines show the equivalent mass loss rates of the progenitor systems ; we adopted the dust - to - gas ratio of 0.01 ( i.e. , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the velocity of the mass loss outflow ) .",
    "vertical dashed lines show the temperature of the cs dust as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "figure 4 shows that the upper limits for @xmath12 , as obtained in the argument using the nir echo ( with the shell model ) , are @xmath69 for the cs dust at @xmath70 pc , @xmath71 at @xmath72 pc , and @xmath73 at @xmath74 pc . beyond this radius ,",
    "the results are especially sensitive to the quality of the observational data , as essentially one needs still - rare late - time photometry for the @xmath26-band .",
    "the strongest constraints for @xmath66 pc are obtained for sne 2000cx , 2001el , and 2003hv , which are only three examples to date having the late time @xmath26-band photometry at @xmath64 year . for these sne , @xmath75 is derived for @xmath76 pc . at @xmath77 pc ,",
    "even the nir bands are too blue ; thus , we can only provide a very loose constraint on the cs dust mass as @xmath78 , even for the best - case scenario ( sn 2003hv ) . to probe the cs dust beyond @xmath79 pc , mid- or far - ir observations",
    "should be more effective @xcite .",
    "the derived upper limits are sufficiently tight to constrain the origin of the non - standard extinction as a scattered echo , as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting upper limit for the optical depth in the @xmath62-band is generally @xmath80 for the cs dust at @xmath65 pc . at @xmath66 pc , the constraint is weaker , but for a few sne , we place the constraint as @xmath81 at @xmath76 pc . above @xmath79 pc ,",
    "the upper limit is consistent with @xmath82 .",
    "these values should be compared to the requirement that the optical depth must be at an order of unity for the scattered echo to have a substantial effect on the extinction law . from this analysis",
    ", we conclude that it is difficult for the scattered echo to be a general origin of the non - standard extinction law toward sne , as long as the cs dust is placed at @xmath65 pc . a possibility that the cs dust at @xmath77 pc creates the non - standard extinction law",
    "is not rejected , although categorising it as ` cs ' dust is questionable ( see below ) .",
    "a dust shell at @xmath83 pc is rejected for some sne ia when the late - time @xmath26-band data are available , but not generally constrained due to a lack of such data .",
    "the above constraints are for the shell model .",
    "one might guess that the constraint would be weakened if the cs dust is confined in a specific direction , e.g. , in an equatorial ring or in bipolar blobs , as the cs dust mass required to create @xmath82 should be reduced . while this is true ,",
    "several additional effects must be considered .",
    "first , the shell model does indeed provide the most conservative upper limit on the cs dust mass .",
    "if one confines the same amount of cs dust in a specific direction , then the local density increases .",
    "this generally results in larger luminosity at a specific epoch than in the corresponding shell model , and thus a tighter limit on @xmath12 is obtained using the observational data at the corresponding epoch ( fig .",
    "2 ) . for example",
    ", the edge - on ring model predicts a larger luminosity than the shell model with the same cs dust mass at the beginning and the end of the nir echo .",
    "in contrast , the same model viewed pole - on has a shorter duration and a larger luminosity .",
    "this large luminosity in the ring model is achieved when the emission at the ring - edge reaches the observer .",
    "a similar argument applies to the blob model .    as for the required cs dust mass within the scattering echo model for the extinction law , it is true that the required mass is reduced for an edge - on observer to the ring - like cs dust structure ( fig .",
    "4 ) . however , for the pole - on case , this effect is compensated for by an increase in the predicted luminosity ( fig .",
    "thus , the resulting upper limit for @xmath84 in the pole - on ring model is similar to that of the shell model ( fig .",
    "4 ) . statistically , there must be edge - on and pole - on counterparts ; the nir echo constraint in this paper , using a number of sne , is sufficiently strong to reject this possibility . if one introduces a _ more confined _",
    "configuration , then this increases the likelihood that it will not be viewed from that direction .",
    "in addition , for a pole - on observer to have a substantial scattering effect , the time required for light to travel to the cs dust must be shorter than the rising time of sne ia ( i.e. , @xmath85 days ) , and therefore the cs dust beyond @xmath86 pc never affects the extinction law if viewed pole - on .",
    "the above argument should be slightly modified for a very confined case , such as when considering the bipolar blob geometry .",
    "similar to the ring - like geometry , the upper limits on the cs dust mass for a bipolar blob are comparable to or deeper than the corresponding shell model , depending on the viewing direction .",
    "if this is converted into the optical depth , the derived upper limits are indeed not extremely strong to readily reject the multiple scattering model for the extinction law , i.e. , @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "however , in this case , the amount of scattered photons should already be limited , due to a small opening angle subtended by the distribution of cs dust . in summary , introducing the confined cs geometry does not help interpret the non - standard extinction law as _ generally _ having come from cs scattered light .",
    "sne suffering a substantial ` cs ' scattering echo effect must be limited to at most only a fraction of sn ia samples .    for the cs dust to have originated from the mass loss of a progenitor ,",
    "the cs gas mass should be @xmath87 a few @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 a few @xmath90 .",
    "this amount of cs dust can create a substantial scattering effect , only if @xmath91 pc , even if we use the conservative requirement @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 pc if we adopt @xmath82 ) .",
    "we generally reject such a large amount of cs dust at @xmath91 pc ( see above ) . therefore ,",
    "if the echo scenario is to be a general origin of the non - standard extinction law , then the dust must indeed be ism in origin , located at @xmath94 pc .",
    "one may question what implications this mass loss rate may have for the progenitor scenario .",
    "indeed , the cs scattering model requires a much larger amount of csm , compared to that predicted by typical progenitor scenarios .",
    "our limit is @xmath95 yr@xmath1 for the mass - loss wind velocity of @xmath2 km s@xmath1 below 0.01 pc , or , in the final @xmath96 years before the explosion .",
    "this is not as strong as the constraint from radio and x - rays ( e.g. , @xmath97 yr@xmath1 for the same velocity , for sn 2011fe : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we emphasise that radio and x - rays probe the materials inside @xmath98 pc ; our proposed method using the nir echo can extend the constraint by an order of magnitude in the spatial dimension ( or to the past before the explosion ) , making our limit independent and unique . from the present analysis",
    "( see below for possible improvement ) , the only scenario that can be marginally rejected , for _ normal _ sne examined in this paper , is a symbiotic system .",
    "however , we do note that sne ia resulting from this path may appear as an atypical sn ia @xcite .",
    "thus far , our limit has been rather conservative , and is based on the condition that the echo luminosity can not exceed the observed one .",
    "however , most of the light should have originated from a radioactive decay chain and subsequent thermalisation , as demonstrated by nir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "given this observational fact , we can refine our limit as follows .",
    "first , attribute the _ template _ light curves in each band to the sn light without any contribution of the possible nir echo ; subtract the templates from the light curves from individual sne ; and then use the residual light curve ( here we take the absolute value if the subtraction results in a negative value ) to place an upper limit on the cs dust mass .",
    "namely , we assume that the echo luminosity does not exceed the _ variation _ in the nir light curves , seen in different sne . as a demonstration , in fig .",
    "3 ( left panel ) we show the case of sn 2006x , for which a good light curve is available .",
    "the figure shows that the magnitude of this residual light curve is @xmath99 less than that of the original , highlighting the standard nature of the nir light curves .    using this argument ,",
    "much tighter constraints can be obtained ( as shown by the thin solid lines in fig .",
    "3 ) . figure 5 shows the results for sn 2006x . because @xmath50- and @xmath51-band data are of the best quality , following the template closely , the upper limit for the cs dust mass , especially at @xmath65 pc , improved significantly . for small @xmath9 ,",
    "the upper limit was reduced by two orders of magnitude , which reflects a residual light curve that was fainter than the original by @xmath100 magnitudes . with this method ,",
    "all of the models with different geometric types result in @xmath101 ( @xmath102 for most situations ) , robustly rejecting the cs scattering model for the extinction law for this particular sn .",
    "the upper limit for the mass loss rate is now @xmath103 yr@xmath1 for @xmath70 pc , much deeper than the conservative limit , as described earlier in this section .",
    "in this paper , our analysis has been based on a particular dust model , i.e. , the lmc - type dust opacity . in this section ,",
    "we examine the effects of different types of cs dust .",
    "figure 6 shows the ` conservative ' limits on the cs dust mass derived for ( a ) astronomical silicate and ( b ) amorphous carbon or graphite , both for the shell model .",
    "figure 7 shows the same but for the ` deeper limit ' for sn 2006x ( i.e. , figure 5 but for astronomical silicate or carbon ) .",
    "the opacities are calculated using optical constants by @xcite and @xcite . to the first approximation ,",
    "the behaviour can be understood by the difference in a typical opacity for different dust models , e.g. , the opacity in the @xmath62-band .",
    "the opacity is roughly a factor of two lower for silicate than the reference lmc - like dust model ; thus , the upper limit for the cs dust mass is weakened by the same factor .",
    "the opacity is roughly an order of magnitude higher for carbon than the lmc - like dust model , and therefore the upper limit on the cs dust mass is deeper for the carbon dust model by an order of magnitude than our fiducial model .",
    "however , these different constraints on the cs dust mass would not substantially alter the constraints on the ability of the cs dust to create the non - standard extinction law .",
    "the optical depth itself is scaled by the same factor ; therefore , the upper limits on @xmath84 would not change substantially .",
    "our results should be compared to sne , in which a large amount of dust is inferred either by the detection of an optical ( scattered ) echo or other probes ( e.g. , narrow absorption systems ) .",
    "for example , we have obtained a tight limit for the amount of cs dust for sn 2006x ( fig .",
    "5 ) , while this sn was detected in a scattered echo @xcite ; its optical spectrum at @xmath64 year after the explosion showed a blue echo component , indicating @xmath82 . in contrast",
    ", we obtained the constraint that @xmath104 , as long as the echo source is at @xmath105pc ( or even @xmath102 at @xmath65 pc ) .",
    "taken together , the detected echo in sn 2006x must be created by ism , as suggested by @xcite using hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) data . to date , even for cases where an ( optical ) echo is detected , evidence of a cs echo remains weak .",
    "another example is highly extinct sn ia 2014j in m82 .",
    "no variability has been found in the narrow absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have claimed temporal evolution in @xmath106 , while no apparent variability has been detected in polarisation measurements @xcite .",
    "while a consistent interpretation for all of these features has yet to be reached , it seems that together they suggest that the cs scattering scenario is unlikely , but perhaps a combination of multiple scattering and true absorption at the ism scale could provide a consistent solution . indeed , detection of an echo has been reported for sn 2014j through high - resolution _ hst _ images at @xmath107 days after the explosion @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted as echoes originating at the interstellar scale . at this epoch",
    ", the sn still dominates the light in the vicinity of the sn and no strong signature of the echo from the cs dust has been obtained ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "8 , we show the results of simulated @xmath26-band images of an echo from the cs dust located at @xmath108 pc for different geometries , for an sn at @xmath109 mpc . for the ring and blob geometries ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath110 and the viewing direction of @xmath111 for the purpose of demonstration .",
    "the model images are convolved with a gaussian kernel of @xmath112 arcsec to roughly simulate observations by _ hst _ ; the narrow field channel of _ hst / nicmos _ has a spatial resolution of @xmath113 arcsec at @xmath114 .",
    "thus our simulation could overestimate the spatial resolution up to @xmath115% , but it could anyway be compensated by increasing the assumed physical scale of the cs dust by the same factor . note that these images are for a ` pure ' echo component  if the projected echo size is smaller than or comparable to the instrument s spatial resolution , then the sn must fade away below the level of the echo luminosity to examine the geometry of the echo signal .",
    "note that there is a better chance to apply this exercise to later epochs .",
    "figure 8 shows the expected evolution covering @xmath100 years , to investigate the possibility of distinguishing different cs dust geometries if a cs dust echo is detected . even for nearby sn 2014j and using _ hst _ , probing the cs dust echo using spatially resolved imagery can be difficult .    for a ring - like structure ,",
    "an elongated structure is visible when @xmath116 . for this particular bipolar blob model ,",
    "the echo ` disappears ' when @xmath116 . for both models",
    ", there is a ( non - monotonic ) shift in the centre of the echo light .",
    "the size of this shift for these particular models is about half of the spatial resolution , and could be detectable with precision astrometry techniques",
    ". these diagnostics could apply to sn 2014j if the cs dust echo is detected in the future following the sn luminosity decrease .",
    "continuous _ hst _",
    "high - resolution observations are strongly encouraged .      while investigation of the cs echo through direct imaging observations is currently limited by the spatial resolution of @xmath5 arcsec at nir wavelengths even with",
    "_ hst _ (  4.2 ) , the situation is expected to improve dramatically in the coming decade .",
    "the planned james webb space telescope ( _ jwst _ ) will reach to a spatial resolution by a factor of @xmath117 better than _",
    "hst_. furthermore , with the availability of nir adaptive optics ( ao ) attached to @xmath118 m class telescopes such as the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , and giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) , spatial resolutions of @xmath3 arcsec are expected .",
    "figures 9 and 10 show synthesised images at different epochs for an sn at a distance of @xmath109 mpc , surrounded by cs dust shell / ring / blobs , as viewed with a spatial resolution of @xmath119 arcsec ( for the viewing direction of @xmath111 as a specific example ) . with this resolution",
    ", one can distinguish different cs dust geometries , even for the cs dust located at @xmath120 pc . for a spherically symmetric distribution ,",
    "investigation of the radial distribution is within reach , as seen by the hole for the shell model .",
    "the ring and blob models show asymmetric image profiles that are clearly different from the shell model ( but depend on the viewing direction ) .",
    "the shift of the centre in these models should be easily resolved beyond the spatial resolution  for example , using this shift , the blob model is distinguishable from any spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "an sn at a distance of @xmath109 mpc is a rare event , at an observed rate of one per decade or two .",
    "figures 11 and 12 show the same images , but for an sn at a distance of @xmath121 mpc . at this distance",
    ", we expect an event rate of roughly one per year ; thus , such observations are , in principle , annual occurrences . for cs dust located at @xmath120 pc around an sn at a distance of @xmath121 mpc , as observed by _ tmt / e - elt / gmt _ ( fig .",
    "11 ) , the situation is similar to the case shown in fig .",
    "an elongated profile of the ring distribution could be marginally resolved , and the shift in images for asymmetrically distributed cs dust ( e.g. , ring or blobs ) could be detectable by a sub - spatial resolution astrometry .",
    "for the cs dust at @xmath108 pc , observations with a spatial resolution of @xmath119 arcsec can distinguish various cs dust geometries , given that such echo signals are detected .",
    "thus , we conclude that the proposed future high - resolution nir ao can open up a new window to examine the cs environment around nearby sne .",
    "we note that a target does not have to be one discovered after the new instruments become available .",
    "for example , sn 2014j can already be a target  assuming an observation at year 2024 , cs dust located at @xmath122 pc can still be investigated .",
    "pilot work on this measurement may already be possible with @xmath123 m class telescopes approaching the diffraction limit ( @xmath93 arcsec ) .",
    "we investigated the effects of _ re - emission _ of sn photons by cs dust for ir wavelengths .",
    "we have shown that this effect allows observed ir light curves to be used to place constraints on the position / size and the amount of cs dust .",
    "we applied the method to observed nir sn ia samples , and found that meaningful upper limits on the cs dust mass can be derived , even under conservative assumptions .",
    "our results are summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath69 for the cs dust at @xmath70 pc , @xmath71 at @xmath72 pc , and @xmath73 at @xmath74 pc .",
    "the mass loss rate must be generally @xmath95 yr@xmath1 up to @xmath124 pc , rejecting a symbiotic path as a main population of the _ normal _ sne ia .",
    "3 .   for a particular case of sn 2006x ,",
    "a deeper limit is obtained ( see below ) : @xmath125 for the cs dust at @xmath70 pc , @xmath69 at @xmath72 pc , and @xmath126 at @xmath74 pc .",
    "the corresponding mass loss rate ( upper limit ) is @xmath127 yr@xmath1 up to @xmath128 pc and @xmath103 yr@xmath1 up to @xmath129 pc .",
    "the above upper limits become tighter if one considers a non - spherical cs distribution .",
    "the above upper limits become even tighter by an order of magnitude for carbon dust .    from these results",
    ", we conclude the following regarding the possibility of the dust - scattering scenario for the non - standard extinction law toward sne ia :    1 .   the ` cs ' dust ( at @xmath130 pc ) echo can not be a general explanation of the non - standard extinction law with regard to sne ia .",
    "the scenario would work for at most a fraction of sne ia , presumably at most , the highly reddened ones .",
    "if the echo scenario is responsible for the extinction law in general , then the dust must be located at @xmath77 pc .",
    "the required mass is , however , @xmath131 ; therefore , this must be attributed to ism rather than csm .",
    "we have also demonstrated an approach that allows deeper limits to be applied .",
    "this involves first using the standard nature of the nir light curves .",
    "we demonstrated this for sn 2006x , showing that the upper limit can be deepened by two orders of magnitude from the conservative limit , as given above .",
    "we suggest that further improvement is possible by refining the analysis method along this line via standardisation of the nir light curves for a given sample and minimisation of the dispersion as a function of time .",
    "this would allow a deeper limit to be placed on the mass loss rate , potentially to the level to limit various models other than the particular symbiotic scenario .",
    "again , one of the main advantages of the proposed method , compared to radio and x - ray constraints ( which are indeed complementary to the proposed method here ) , is the following : the limit to the amount of dust placed by the nir echo extends an order of magnitude larger in the spatial dimension ( or an order of magnitude to the past in the time dimension ) , reflecting the fact that the light speed ( for the echo ) is by an order of magnitude faster than the shock velocity ( for radio and x - rays ) .    as we have shown in this paper , late - time photometry , even sparse , especially in the @xmath26-band ,",
    "is essential to constrain dust ( and gas ) mass in the environment at @xmath66 pc .",
    "our method underlines the importance and usefulness of such data .",
    "our analysis is also highlighted by the possibilities of ( 1 ) constraining the origin of the non - standard extinction law , and ( 2 ) constraining the csm mass up to @xmath64 pc , namely the regimes that the other methods like radio and x - ray diagnostics can not probe . because the data are still rare , we propose increasing the sample of nir / mid - ir sne with continuous observational efforts .",
    "of course , if one wants to go further toward the ism regime , mid- and far - ir data are important @xcite , and a combination of the early radio / x , early and late - time nir , and late - time mid-/far - ir , perhaps complemented by the absorption system study ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will hopefully provide a complete view of these issues .",
    "we also investigated the possibility of studying the cs dust distribution through high spatial resolution observations .",
    "our results are summarised below .    1",
    ".   cs dust around sn 2014j could potentially be resolved by future _ hst _ observations , given that dense cs dust shell / ring / blobs exist at @xmath77 pc from the sn site .",
    "future nir ao instruments attached to @xmath118 m class telescopes are capable of distinguishing various distributions of cs dust , thus providing a powerful means for investigating the cs environment around sne ia .",
    "3 .   such observations will be possible for nearby sne at a rate of roughly once a year .",
