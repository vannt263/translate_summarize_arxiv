    "the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter is of crucial importance for the understanding of a large variety of phenomena in nuclear physics and astrophysics .",

    ", measurements of isoscalar collective vibrations , collective flows and meson production have contributed to constrain the eos for symmetric matter for densities up to five time the saturation value @xcite . however , the eos of asymmetric matter has comparatively few experimental constraints : the isovector part of the nuclear effective interaction ( asy - eos ) and the corresponding symmetry energy are largely unknown far from normal density .",
    "this information is essential also in the astrophysical context , for the understanding of the properties of compact objects such as neutron stars , whose crust behaves as low - density asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite and whose core may touch extreme values of density and asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the low - density behavior of the symmetry energy also affects the structure of exotic nuclei and the appearance of new features involving the neutron skin @xcite .    over the past years , several observables which are sensitive to the asy - eos and testable experimentally ,",
    "have been suggested @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we will focus on some effects related to the low - density sector of the nuclear eos . the first part will be devoted to the study of collective excitations in neutron - rich systems .",
    "new exotic collective modes show up when one moves away from the valley of stability @xcite . in particular",
    ", we will discuss results concerning the appearance of an interesting exotic mode , the pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) , which was observed as an unusually large concentration of the dipole response at energies clearly below the values associated with the standard giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "then , in the second part , we will discuss dissipation and fragmentation mechanisms at fermi energies , concentrating on isospin effects and on the sensitivity of detectable observables to the asy - eos .",
    "nuclear collective motion and nuclear reactions are modeled by solving transport equations based on mean field theories , with correlations included via hard nucleon - nucleon elastic collisions and via stochastic forces , selfconsistently evaluated from the mean phase - space trajectory , see @xcite .",
    "stochasticity is essential in order to get distributions as well as to allow for the growth of dynamical instabilities .    in the beam energy range up to a few hundred @xmath1 ,",
    "the appropriate tool is the so - called boltzmann - langevin equation ( ble ) @xcite : @xmath2   + \\delta i[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the one - body distribution function , the semi - classical analog of the wigner transform of the one - body density , @xmath4 the mean field hamiltonian , @xmath5 the two - body collision term incorporating the fermi statistics of the particles , and @xmath6 $ ] the fluctuating part of the collision integral .",

    "one of the important tasks in many - body physics is to understand the emergence of the collective features as well as their structure in terms of the individual motion of the constituents .",
    "the experimental characterization and theoretical description of new exotic collective excitations is a challenge for modern nuclear physics .",
    "recent experiments provided several evidences about their existence but the available information is still incomplete and their nature is a matter of debate . in particular , many efforts have been devoted to the study of the pdr , identified as an unusually large concentration of the dipole response at energies below the values corresponding to the gdr .",
    "the latter is one of the most prominent and robust collective motions , present in all nuclei , whose centroid position varies , for medium - heavy nuclei , as @xmath13 . from a comparison of the available data for",
    "stable and unstable @xmath14 isotopes a correlation between the fraction of pygmy strength and isospin asymmetry was noted @xcite . in general the exhausted sum - rule increases with the proton - to - neutron asymmetry .",
    "this behavior was related to the symmetry energy properties below saturation and therefore connected to the size of the neutron skin @xcite .    in spite of the theoretical progress in the interpretation of this mode and new experimental information @xcite , a number of critical questions concerning the nature of the pdr still remains .",
    "our goal is to address the important issue related to the collective nature of the pdr in connection with the role of the symmetry energy .",
    "an accurate picture of the gdr in nuclei corresponds to an admixture of goldhaber - teller ( g - t ) and stenweidel - jensen ( s - j ) vibrations .",
    "the latter , in symmetric nuclear matter , is a volume type oscillation of the isovector density @xmath15 keeping the total density @xmath16 constant @xcite .",
    "a microscopic , self - consistent study of the collective features and of the role of the nuclear effective interaction upon the pdr can be performed within the landau theory of fermi liquids .",
    "this is based on two coupled landau - vlasov kinetic equations ( see eq.(1 ) , neglecting the stochastic term ) for neutron and proton one - body distribution functions @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and was applied quite successfully in describing various features of the gdr , including pre - equilibrium dipole excitation in fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that within such a semi - classical description shell effects are absent , certainly important in shaping the fine structure of the dipole response @xcite . by solving numerically the vlasov equation in the absence of coulomb interaction , urban @xcite evidenced from the study of the total dipole moment @xmath19 a collective response around @xmath20 @xmath21 which was identified as a pygmy mode .",
    "it was pointed out , from the properties of transition densities and velocities , that the pdr can be related to one of the low - lying modes associated with isoscalar toroidal excitations , providing indications about its isoscalar character . here",
    ", considering in the transport simulations also the coulomb interaction , we shall investigate in a complementary way the collective nature of pdr by studying the dynamics of the pygmy degree of freedom , @xmath22 , that is usually associated with the neutron excess in the nuclear surface @xcite .",
    "moreover , we shall explore the isoscalar character of the mode by a comparative analysis employing three different density parametrizations of the symmetry energy .",
    "we neglect the two - body collision effects and hence the main ingredient of the dynamics is the nuclear mean - field , for which we consider a skyrme - like ( @xmath23 ) parametrization @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the saturation density .",
    "the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter are reproduced with the values of the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , leading to a compressibility modulus @xmath31 . for the isovector sector",
    "we employ three different parameterizations of @xmath11 with the density : the asysoft , the asystiff and asysuperstiff respectively , see @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "the value of the symmetry energy , @xmath32 , at saturation , as well as the slope parameter , @xmath33 , are reported in table [ table1 ] for each of these asy - eos . just below the saturation density",
    "the asysoft mean field has a weak variation with density while the asysuperstiff shows a rapid decrease .",
    "then , due to surface contributions to the collective oscillations , we expect to see some differences in the energy position of the dipole response of the system .",
    "the numerical procedure to integrate the transport equations is based on the test - particle ( t.p . )",
    "method . for a good spanning of phase - space we work with @xmath34 t.p . per nucleon .",
    "we consider the neutron rich nucleus @xmath0 and we determine its ground state configuration as the equilibrium ( static ) solution of eq.(1 ) .",
    "then proton and neutron densities @xmath35 can be evaluated . as an additional check of our initialization procedure ,",
    "the neutron and proton mean square radii @xmath36 , as well as the skin thickness @xmath37 , were also calculated in the ground state and shown in table [ table1 ] .",

[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values obtained with our semi - classical approach are in a reasonable agreement with those reported by employing other models for similar interactions @xcite .",
    "the neutron skin thickness is increasing with the slope parameter , as expected from a faster reduction of the symmetry term on the surface @xcite .",
    "this feature has been discussed in detail in @xcite .    to inquire on the collective properties of the pygmy dipole we excite the nuclear system at the initial time @xmath38 by boosting along the @xmath39 direction all excess neutrons ( @xmath40 ) and in opposite direction all core nucleons , while keeping the c.m. of the nucleus at rest ( pygmy - like initial conditions ) .",
    "the excess neutrons were identified as the most distant @xmath41 neutrons from the nucleus cm .",
    "then the system is left to evolve and the evolution of the collective coordinates @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , associated with the different isovector dipole modes ( pygmy , core and total dipole ) is followed for @xmath45 by solving numerically the equations ( 1 ) . during the time evolution the number of t. p. escaping from the system corresponds , on average , to less than half a neutron , while the total energy conservation is satisfied within @xmath46 .      as shown in figure [ diptime ] , apart from the quite undamped oscillations of the @xmath42 coordinate , we also remark that the core does not remain inert .",

    "we plot the time evolution of the dipole @xmath22 , of the total dipole @xmath19 and core dipole @xmath47 moments , for two asy - eos . as observed ,",
    "while @xmath22 approaches its maximum value , an oscillatory motion of the dipole @xmath47 initiates and this response is symmetry energy dependent : the larger is the slope parameter @xmath48 , the more delayed is the isovector core reaction .",
    "this can be explained in terms of low - density ( surface ) contributions to the vibration and therefore of the density behavior of the symmetry energy below normal density : a larger l corresponds to a larger neutron presence in the surface and so to a smaller coupling to the core protons .",
    "we see that the total dipole @xmath49 is strongly affected by the presence of isovector core oscillations , mostly related to the isovector part of the effective interaction .",
    "indeed , @xmath49 gets a higher oscillation frequency with respect to @xmath22 , sensitive to the asy - eos .",
    "the fastest vibrations are observed in the asysoft case , which gives the largest value of the symmetry energy below saturation . in correspondence",
    "the frequency of the pygmy mode seems to be not much affected by the trend of the symmetry energy below saturation , see also next figure [ dipspectrum ] , clearly showing the different nature , isoscalar - like , of this oscillation . for each case",
    "we calculate the power spectrum of @xmath22 : @xmath50 and similarly for @xmath19 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ dipspectrum ] .",
    "the position of the centroid corresponding to the gdr shifts toward larger values when we move from asysuperstiff ( largest slope parameter @xmath48 ) to asysoft eos .",
    "this evidences the importance of the volume , s - j component of the gdr in @xmath0 .",
    "the energy centroid associated with the pdr is situated below the gdr peak , at around @xmath51 , quite insensitive to the asy - eos , pointing to an isoscalar - like nature of this mode .",
    "hence the structure of the dipole response can be explained in terms of the development of isoscalar - like ( pdr ) and isovector - like ( gdr ) modes , as observed in asymmetric systems @xcite .",
    "( color online ) the power spectrum of total dipole ( a ) and of the dipole @xmath22 ( b ) ( in @xmath52 ) , for asysoft ( the blue ( solid ) lines ) , asystiff ( the black ( dot - dashed ) lines ) and asysuperstiff ( the red ( dashed ) lines ) eos .",
    "pygmy - like initial conditions . ]",
    "both modes are excited in the considered pygmy - like initial conditions .",
    "looking at the total dipole mode direction , that is close to the isovector - like normal mode , one observes a quite large contribution in the gdr region . on the other hand , although the pygmy mode has a more complicated structure @xcite , the @xmath42 direction appears closely related to it .",
    "indeed a larger response amplitude is detected in the pygmy region , see figure 2 ( bottom ) .",
    "( color online ) the same as in figure [ dipspectrum ] but for a gdr - like initial excitation . ]    to check the influence of the initial conditions on the dipole response , let us consider the case of a gdr - like excitation , corresponding to a boost of all neutrons against all protons , keeping the cm at rest .",
    "now the initial excitation favors the isovector - like mode and even in the @xmath42 direction we observe a sizable contribution in the gdr region , see the fourier spectrum of @xmath22 in figure [ gdrspectrum ] . from this result",
    "it clearly emerges that a part of the @xmath53 excess neutrons is involved in a gdr type motion and the relative weight depends on the symmetry energy : more neutrons are involved in the pygmy mode in the asysuperstiff eos case , in connection to the larger neutron skin size .",
    "we have also checked that , if the coordinate y is constructed by taking the @xmath54 most distant neutrons ( with @xmath55 ) , the relative weight increases in the pdr region . in any case , since part of the excess nucleons contributes to the gdr mode , a low ewsr value is expected in the pdr region .",
    "indeed , in the fourier power spectrum of @xmath19 in figure [ gdrspectrum ] , a weak response is seen at the pygmy frequency . in the case of the gdr - like initial excitation ,",
    "i.e. boosting all neutrons against all protons , we can relate the strength function to @xmath56 @xcite and then the corresponding cross section can be calculated .",
    "our estimate of the integrated cross section over the pdr region represents @xmath57 for asysoft , @xmath58 for asystiff and @xmath59 for asysuperstiff , out of the total cross section .",
    "hence the ewsr exhausted by the pdr is proportional to the skin thickness , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "in this energy range , reactions between charge asymmetric systems are charecterized by a direct isospin transport in binary events .",
    "this process also involves the low density neck region and is sensitive to the low density behavior of @xmath7 , see refs.@xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , it is now quite well established that the largest part of the reaction cross section for dissipative collisions at fermi energies goes through the _ neck fragmentation _",
    "channel , with intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) directly produced in the interacting zone in semiperipheral collisions on short time scales @xcite .",
    "it is possible to predict interesting isospin transport effects also for this fragmentation mechanism since clusters are formed still in a dilute asymmetric matter but always in contact with the regions of the projectile - like and target - like remnants almost at normal densities .",
    "results on these mechanisms , obtained with the smf model , are discussed below .      in peripheral and semi - peripheral reactions , it is interesting to look at the asymmetries of the various parts of the interacting system in the exit channel : emitted particles , projectile - like ( plf ) and target - like fragments ( tlf ) , and in the case of ternary ( or higher multiplicity ) events , imf s . in particular , one can study the so - called isospin transport ratio , which is defined as @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "here , @xmath62 is an isospin sensitive quantity that has to be investigated with respect to equilibration .",
    "we consider primarily the asymmetry @xmath63 , but also other quantities , such as isoscaling coefficients , ratios of production of light fragments , etc , can be of interest @xcite .",
    "the indices @xmath64 and @xmath48 refer to the symmetric reaction between the heavy ( @xmath65-rich ) and the light ( @xmath65-poor ) systems , while @xmath66 refers to the mixed reaction .",
    "@xmath67 denote the rapidity region , in which this quantity is measured , in particular the plf and tlf rapidity regions . clearly , this ratio is @xmath68 in the projectile and target regions , respectively , for complete transparency , and oppositely for complete rebound , while it is zero for complete equilibration .",
    "isospin transport ratios as a function of relative energy loss .",
    "upper panel : separately for stiff ( solid ) and soft ( dashed ) asy - eos , and for two parameterizations of the isoscalar part of the interaction : md ( circles and squares ) and mi ( diamonds and triangles ) , in the projectile region ( full symbols ) and the target region ( open symbols ) .",
    "lower panel : quadratic fit to all points for the stiff ( solid ) , resp .",
    "soft ( dashed ) asy - eos . ]    in a simple model one can show that the isospin transport ratio mainly depends on two quantities : the strength of the symmetry energy and the interaction time between the two reaction partners .",
    "let us take , for instance , the asymmetry @xmath69 of the plf ( or tlf ) as the quantity @xmath62 .",
    "at a first order approximation , in the mixed reaction this quantity relaxes towards its complete equilibration value , @xmath70 , as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the time elapsed while the reaction partners stay in contact ( interaction time ) and the damping @xmath73 is mainly connected to the strength of the symmetry energy @xcite . inserting this expression into eq.([imb_rat ] ) , one obtains @xmath74 for the plf and tlf regions , respectively .",
    "hence the isospin transport ratio can be considered as a good observable to trace back the strength of the symmetry energy from the reaction dynamics provided a suitable selection of the interaction time is performed .",
    "the centrality dependence of the isospin ratio , for sn + sn collisions at 35 and 50 @xmath1 , has been investigated in experiments as well as in theory @xcite , and information about the stiffness of the symmetry energy has been extracted from the analysis presented in @xcite , based on the imqmd model . here",
    "we investigate more in detail the relation between charge equilibration , interaction times and thermal equilibrium .",
    "longer interaction times should be correlated to a larger dissipation .",
    "it is then natural to look at the correlation between the isospin transport ratio and the total kinetic energy loss . in this way one can also better disentangle dynamical effects of the isoscalar and isovector part of the eos , see @xcite .",
    "it is seen in figure [ imb_eloss ] ( top ) that the curves for the asysoft eos ( dashed ) are generally lower in the projectile region ( and oppositely for the target region ) , i.e. show more equilibration , than those for the asystiff eos , due to the higher value of the symmetry energy at low density . to emphasize this trend , all the values for the stiff ( circles ) and the soft ( squares ) asy - eos , corresponding to different impact parameters , beam energies and also to two possible parametrizations of the isoscalar part of the nuclear interaction ( with and without momentum dependence , md and mi ) ,",
    "are collected together in the bottom part of the figure .",
    "one can see that all the points essentially follow a given line , depending only on the symmetry energy parameterization adopted .",
    "it is seen , that there is a systematic effect of the symmetry energy of the order of about 20 percent , which should be measurable .",
    "moreover , we notice that the quantity @xmath75 is a rapidly decreasing function of the degree of dissipation , @xmath76 , reached in the collision .",
    "this can be explained in terms of dissipation mechanisms maily due to mean - field effects , as predicted by the smf model .",
    "indeed , according to a mean - field picture , a significant degree of thermal equilibrium ( i.e. a considerable @xmath76 ) would imply a rather long contact time between the two reaction partners , thus certainly leading to isospin equilibration , that needs a shorter time scale to be reached .",
    "the correlation suggested in figure [ imb_eloss ] should represent a general feature of isospin diffusion , as expected on the basis of dominant mean - field mechanisms , and it would be of great interest to verify it experimentally .",
    "-1.0 cm      in presence of density gradients , as the ones occurring when a low - density neck region is formed between the two reaction partners in semi - peripheral collisions , the isospin transport is mainly ruled by the density derivative of the symmetry energy and so we expect a larger neutron flow to the neck clusters for a stiffer symmetry energy around saturation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism leads to the neutron enrichment of the neck region ( isospin migration ) .",
    "this is shown in figure [ nzphi ] ( left ) , where the asymmetry of the neck and plf - tlf regions , obtained in neutron - rich reactions at 50 mev / u , are plotted for two asy - eos choices .    from the experimental point of view , a new analysis has been recently published on sn+ni data at @xmath77 by the chimera collab.@xcite .",
    "a strong correlation between neutron enrichement and fragment alignement ( when the short emission time selection is enforced ) is seen , that points to a stiff behavior of the symmetry energy ( @xmath78 ) , for which a large neutron enrichment of neck fragments is seen ( left ) .",
    "1.0 cm 0.5 cm     in order to build observables less affected by secondary decay effects , in fig . 5 ( right ) we consider the ratio of the asymmetries of the imf s to those of the residues ( @xmath79 ) for stiff and soft asy - eos .",
    "this quantity can be estimated on the basis of simple energy balance considerations . by imposing to get a maximum ( negative ) variation of @xmath7",
    "when transfering the neutron richness from plf and tlf towards the neck region , one obtains : @xmath80 from this simple argument the ratio between the imf and residue asymmetries should depend only on symmetry energy properties and , in particular , on the difference of the symmetry energy corresponding to the residue and neck densities ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , as appropriate for isospin migration .",
    "it should also be larger than one , more so for the asystiff than for the asysoft eos .",
    "it is seen indeed in figure 5 ( right part ) , that this ratio is nicely dependent on the asy - eos only ( being larger in the asystiff case ) and not on the system considered .",
    "if final asymmetries were affected in the same way by secondary evaporation in the case of neck and plf fragments , then one could directly compare the results of figure 5 ( right ) to data .",
    "however , due to the different size and temperature of the neck region with respect to plf or tlf sources , de - excitation effects should be carefully checked with the help of suitable decay codes .",
    "-1.0 cm      a detailed investigation of isospin equilibration has been recently undertaken within transport codes based on the molecular dynamics ( qmd ) approach @xcite . in comparison to the transport models considered before , mainly describing one - body effects ( such as the smf model , see eq.(1 ) ) , such approaches , where nucleons are represented as individual wave packets of fixed compact shape ( usually taken as gaussians ) , may lead to approximate descriptions of mean - field effects .",
    "on the other hand , fluctuations and correlations should be well reproduced , especially in the exit channel of multifragmentation events .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , where charge equilibration is investigated for @xmath83 reactions at 35 and 50 @xmath1 , the imqmd code predicts a quite different behavior with respect to smf : the isospin transport ratio exhibits a rather flat behavior as a function of the impact parameter .",
    "this seems to indicate that , even in the case of central collisions , the contact time between the two reaction partners remains rather short , the dissipation mechanisms being mostly due to many - body correlations rather than to mean - field effects .",
    "thus the more explosive dynamics would lead to the lower degree of isospin equilibration observed .    to examine more in detail the origin of the observed discrepancies , results concerning imf ( @xmath84 ) properties , obtained with the smf and imqmd codes ,",
    "are compared in figure 6 . in the left panel , the average total charge per event , associated with imf s ,",
    "is plotted as a function of the reduced rapidity , for the reaction @xmath85sn + @xmath85sn at 50 mev / u and impact parameters b = 6 and 8 fm . from this comparison",
    "it is clear that in imqmd a larger number of light imf s , distributed over all rapidity range between plf and tlf , are produced . on the other hand ,",
    "mostly binary or ternary events are observed in smf , with light imf s located very close to mid - rapidity .",
    "then the different reaction dynamics predicted by the two codes may explain the different results seen for isospin equilibration especially in semi - peripheral and central reactions ( b @xmath86 4 - 6 fm ) .",
    "the fast imqmd fragmentation dynamics inhibits nucleon exchange and charge equilibration . on the other hand , in smf dissipation",
    "is dominated by mean - field mechanisms , acting over longer time intervals and leading to stronger equilibration effects .",
    "let panel : average total charge per event , associated with imf s , as a function of the reduced rapidity , obtained in the reaction @xmath85sn + @xmath85sn at 50 mev / u .",
    "results are shown for imqmd calculations at b = 6 fm ( thick line ) and b = 8 fm ( thin line ) and for smf calculations at b = 6 fm ( full circles ) and b = 8 fm ( open circles ) .",

    "results on the neutron content of the neck region are illustrated in the right panel of figure 6 , that shows the global n / z of imf s as a function of the reduced rapidity .",
    "as discussed above , smf calculations clearly predict a larger n / z for imf s produced at mid - rapidity , with respect to plf and tlf regions ( isospin migration effect ) .",
    "the effect is particularly pronounced in the case of the asystiff parametrization .",
    "on the contrary , imqmd calculations predict a minimum of the n / z ratio at mid - rapidity .",
    "the reasons of the these differences need to be further investigated .    -1.0",
    "we have reviewed some aspects of the rich phenomenology associated with nuclear reactions , from which interesting hints are emerging to constrain the nuclear eos and , in particular , the largely debated density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "information on the low density region can be accessed in reactions from low to intermediate energies , where collective excitations and fragmentation mechanisms are dominant .",
    "we have shown , within a semi - classical landau - vlasov approach , the existence , in neutron rich nuclei , of a collective pygmy dipole mode determined by the oscillations of some excess neutrons against the nuclear core . from the transport simulations the pdr energy centroid for @xmath0 appears around @xmath87 @xmath21 , rather insensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy and well below the gdr peak .",
    "this supports the isoscalar - like character of this collective motion . a complex pattern , involving the coupling of the neutron skin with the core dipole mode , is noticed .",
    "this reduces considerably the ewsr acquired by the pdr , our numerical estimate providing values well below @xmath88 , but proportional to the symmetry energy slope parameter @xmath48 , that affects the number of excess neutrons on the nuclear surface . concerning nuclear reactions at fermi energies ,",
    "we have discussed some results on isospin sensitive observables . in particular , we have concentrated our analysis on the charge equilibration mechanism ( and its relation to energy dissipation ) and on the neutron - enrichment of the neck region in semi - peripheral reactions . from the study of the latter mechanism , for which new experimental evidences have recently appeared @xcite , hints are emerging towards a stiff behavior of the symmetry energy around normal density .",
    "this is compatible with recent results from structure data , see for instance the review article @xcite .    finally , we have also considered results of different transport codes ( see section 4.3 ) , undertaking a comparison of imqmd and smf predictions for selected observables . due to the different role of mean - field effects , vs. fluctuations and many - body correlations , in the two codes , the description of the reaction dynamics is model dependent ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this affects also isospin sensitive observables .",
