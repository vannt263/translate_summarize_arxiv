    "we study the heat kernel on asymptotically conic manifolds .",
    "asymptotically conic manifolds should be thought of as those complete manifolds which are approximately conic near infinity .",
    "more specifically , we have the following definition @xcite :    let @xmath1 be a complete riemannian manifold without boundary of dimension @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be the usual radial compactification of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a closed riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is asymptotically conic with cross - section @xmath6 if in a neighborhood of @xmath7 , @xmath3 is isometric to @xmath8 with the metric @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a smooth function on @xmath3 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 on @xmath7 ( we call this a _ boundary defining function _ for @xmath7 ) and a smooth family of metrics @xmath13 on @xmath14 with @xmath15 . throughout , we let @xmath16 be a global coordinate on @xmath0 , writing @xmath17 in a neighborhood of the boundary of @xmath3 .    in particular , euclidean space @xmath18 is asymptotically conic with cross - section @xmath19 ; we may choose @xmath20 .",
    "any complete manifold which is exactly euclidean or conic near infinity is , of course , also asymptotically conic .",
    "the condition ( [ acmetric ] ) may be weakened by replacing @xmath13 with any symmetric 2-tensor @xmath21 which restricts to a metric @xmath22 on the boundary at @xmath11 ; an observation of melrose and wunsch @xcite shows that these conditions are in fact equivalent .",
    "asymptotically conic manifolds are a relatively well - behaved class of manifolds , and as such the theory of the heat equation is relatively advanced . in particular",
    ", it is easy to see from ( [ acmetric ] ) that all sectional curvatures of @xmath1 approach zero as @xmath10 goes to zero , and thus that @xmath1 has bounded sectional curvature . for complete manifolds of bounded sectional curvature , a classical theorem of cheng - li - yau @xcite gives the following gaussian upper bound for the heat kernel :    [ chengliyau]@xcite there are nonzero constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that the heat kernel on @xmath0 , denoted @xmath25 , satisfies @xmath26    however , for many applications to spectral theory , one needs finer information about the structure of the heat kernel .",
    "the example we have in mind is the definition of the zeta function . recall that if @xmath0 is compact , the zeta function is defined for @xmath27 by : @xmath28 the zeta function has a well - known meromorphic continuation to all of @xmath29 with a regular value at @xmath30",
    "; the key is that the trace of the heat kernel has a short - time asymptotic expansion , which , along with the long - time exponential decay , enables us to write down an explicit meromorphic continuation @xcite .",
    "the _ determinant of the laplacian _ is then given by @xmath31 ; the determinant plays a key role in many problems in spectral theory , including the isospectral compactness results of osgood , phillips , and sarnak @xcite .",
    "we would like to define such a zeta function and determinant when @xmath0 is asymptotically conic , with an eye towards applying these concepts to the spectral and scattering theory of asymptotically conic manifolds .",
    "there are several obstacles .",
    "first , the heat kernel is no longer trace class , so @xmath32 does not make sense .",
    "instead , we define the _ renormalized heat trace _ @xmath33 to be the finite part at @xmath34 of the divergent asymptotic expansion in @xmath35 of @xmath36 details , including the existence of this divergent asymptotic expansion , may be found in section 3 .",
    "we then formally define the _",
    "renormalized zeta function _ : @xmath37    however , to make sense of this definition and obtain a meromorphic continuation , we still need to understand the behavior of the renormalized trace - and hence of the heat kernel itself - as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , we need asymptotics in both the short and long time regimes .",
    "the short - time behavior of the heat kernel on an asymptotically conic manifold is relatively well - understood .",
    "short - time heat kernels may be analyzed using techniques from semiclassical analysis . in this approach ,",
    "the goal is to develop a semiclassical functional calculus containing the heat kernel , modeled on standard semiclassical techniques as developed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the key functional calculus for this purpose , at least in the asymptotically euclidean setting , is the weyl calculus of hormander @xcite .",
    "an alternate approach , and one more suited to analysis of the renormalized trace and determinant , is to use geometric microlocal analysis to first construct the heat kernel and then analyze its fine structure .",
    "the techniques of geometric microlocal analysis were first developed by melrose and mendoza to study elliptic pde on manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical ends @xcite .",
    "they have been extended by many other mathematicians and play a key role in the modern analysis of linear pde on singular and non - compact spaces .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , melrose discusses some aspects of spectral and scattering theory on asymptotically conic manifolds .",
    "albin , in @xcite , uses these methods to investigate the short - time heat kernel on a variety of complete spaces , including asymptotically conic manifolds .",
    "his work can be used to obtain the fine structure that we need for the short - time heat kernel .",
    "the long - time problem is trickier : in the asymptotically conic setting , we no longer have exponential decay of the heat kernel as @xmath39 . indeed , from the structure of the euclidean heat kernel and ( [ gaussianub ] )",
    ", we expect that the leading - order behavior of @xmath25 as @xmath39 will be @xmath40 , and the leading - order behavior of the renormalized heat trace may be even worse .",
    "this lack of decay means that the zeta function may not be well - defined a priori for any @xmath41 .",
    "we may split ( [ rzetadefin ] ) into two integrals by breaking it up at @xmath42 , but there is no obvious reason for the integral from @xmath42 to @xmath43 to have a meromorphic continuation to all of @xmath29 . in order to obtain such a meromorphic continuation , we need an asymptotic expansion for the heat kernel as @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , we must understand how this expansion interacts with the heat trace renormalization .",
    "we solve this problem by using the methods of geometric microlocal analysis to obtain a complete description of the asymptotic structure of the heat kernel on @xmath0 in all spatial and temporal regimes .",
    "the key concepts , including blow - ups and polyhomogeneous conormal functions , were originally introduced in @xcite and @xcite , and a good introduction may be found in @xcite . in section 2 , we discuss these concepts briefly and then use them to define a new blown - up manifold with corners which we call @xmath44 .",
    "the space @xmath44 was originally defined by guillarmou and hassell in @xcite , and we use their labeling of the boundary hypersurfaces ; see section 2 for the definitions .",
    "our main theorem is the following :    [ maincor ] let @xmath0 be asymptotically conic . for any @xmath45 , and for any fixed time @xmath46 , the heat kernel on @xmath0 is polyhomogeneous conormal on @xmath44 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the leading orders at the boundary hypersurfaces are at least 0 at sc and @xmath2 at each of bf@xmath49 , rb@xmath49 , lb@xmath49 , and zf , with infinite - order decay at lb , rb , and bf .",
    "this theorem gives a complete description of the asymptotic structure of the heat kernel for long time ; previously , only estimates such as theorem @xcite were known .",
    "the analogous structure for the short - time heat kernel is well - understood ( see section 2 for the definition of @xmath50 ) :    [ zshorttime ] for @xmath51 , the heat kernel @xmath52 is polyhomogeneous conormal on @xmath53_{\\sqrt t } ; \\{\\sqrt t=0,z = z'\\}].\\ ] ] moreover , there is infinite - order decay at all faces except the scattering front face sc and the face f obtained by the final blowup .",
    "theorem [ zshorttime ] follows immediately from the work of albin @xcite ; however , the precise statement above does not appear in the literature .",
    "therefore , in the appendix , we give a simple proof using the machinery developed in @xcite .",
    "combining theorem [ maincor ] with theorem [ zshorttime ] gives a complete geometric - microlocal description of the structure of the heat kernel .",
    "this structure is illustrated in figure [ hkac ] ; the short - time structure is the left - hand side of the diagram , and the long - time structure is the right - hand side .",
    "we also indicate the leading order of the heat kernel at each of the boundary hypersurfaces , in terms of @xmath54 at @xmath55 , @xmath48 at @xmath56 , and @xmath10 or @xmath57 respectively at all the finite - time boundaries .    .",
    "]    as an example of how polyhomogeneous structure may be used to read off the behavior in all asymptotic regimes , let @xmath58 be a parameter , and fix @xmath59 ; consider the heat kernel @xmath60 as @xmath58 approaches infinity . in the compactified space in figure [ hkac ] ,",
    "as @xmath58 approaches infinity , the arguments approach a point in the center of the face lb@xmath49 , where the leading order of the heat kernel is @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is a boundary defining function for lb@xmath49 , we conclude that @xmath60 has a polyhomogeneous asymptotic expansion in @xmath63 as @xmath64 , with leading term @xmath65 .",
    "a similar analysis may be performed in any asymptotic regime .    as an application , theorems [ maincor ] and [ zshorttime ]",
    "give us precisely the polyhomogeneous structure we need to define and investigate the renormalized zeta function on @xmath0 :    [ bigrenorm ] let @xmath0 be asymptotically conic .",
    "the renormalized zeta function , defined formally by ( [ rzetadefin ] ) , is well - defined and has a meromorphic continuation to all of @xmath29 .",
    "we may then define the _",
    "renormalized determinant _ of the laplacian on @xmath0 by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coefficient of @xmath41 in the laurent series for @xmath68 around @xmath30 .    in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we use theorems [ maincor ] , [ zshorttime ] , and [ bigrenorm ] to analyze the behavior of the determinant of the laplacian on a family of manifolds degenerating to a manifold with conical singularities .",
    "we expect that this work will have applications to spectral theory and to index theory on singular spaces , including the study of the cheeger - mller theorem on manifolds with conical singularities .",
    "the key theorem from @xcite is as follows : let @xmath69 be a manifold with an exact conic singularity ( with arbitrary base ) and let @xmath70 be a manifold conic near infinity with the same base .",
    "for each @xmath71 , we define a smooth manifold @xmath72 replacing the tip of @xmath69 with an @xmath73-scaled copy of @xmath70 ; as @xmath74 , the manifolds @xmath72 converge to @xmath69 in the gromov - hausdorff sense . then it is proven in @xcite that    [ detapprox ] as @xmath74 , @xmath75      the usual geometric - microlocal approach to the fine structure of the heat kernel is a direct parametrix construction , which involves the construction of an initial approximation to the heat kernel and then the removal of the error via a neumann series argument .",
    "this is the method adopted in @xcite .",
    "however , parametrix constructions are not well - suited for analysis of the long - time heat kernel ; the problem is global rather than local . in order to obtain the asymptotic structure of the heat kernel at long time , we instead take an indirect approach .",
    "recall that the functional calculus shows that the heat kernel and the resolvent are related by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a contour around the spectrum and @xmath78 is the positive laplacian . in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "guillarmou and hassell have analyzed the asymptotic structure of the resolvent @xmath79 at low energy , again giving a complete description in all regimes .",
    "they have shown :    [ ghlow]@xcite suppose that @xmath0 is an asymptotically conic manifold of dimension @xmath80 .",
    "then the schwartz kernel of @xmath81 is polyhomogeneous conormal on @xmath82 for each @xmath83 , with a conormal singularity at the spatial diagonal and all coefficients smoothly depending on @xmath84 .",
    "it decays to infinite order at the faces lb , rb , and bf , with leading orders at sc , bf@xmath49 , rb@xmath49 , lb@xmath49 and zf given by @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath86 , @xmath86 , and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "note that guillarmou and hassell require @xmath80 . in section 4 , we adapt the methods of @xcite to extend theorem [ ghlow ] to the two - dimensional case :    [ dslow ] theorem [ ghlow ] also holds when @xmath87 ; all the leading orders are the same , except that we have logarithmic growth instead of order 0 at zf .",
    "in section 2 , we use geometric microlocal analysis , in particular melrose s pushforward theorem , to prove theorem [ maincor ] .",
    "the key is to push the structure of theorems [ ghlow ] and [ dslow ] through the contour integral ( [ relation ] ) . to state the main technical theorem , we must first compactify @xmath82 to @xmath88 by introducing a new boundary face at @xmath89 , with boundary defining function @xmath90 . in a neighborhood of the new face , which we call tf , @xmath88 is @xmath91 .",

    "once we have proven theorem [ mainthm ] , theorem [ maincor ] is an almost immediate consequence , though there is a slight twist involving the leading orders .    in section 3",

    "the idea is to formally introduce polar coordinates around a submanifold of a manifold with corners , in order to distinguish between directions of approach to that submanifold .",
    "for example , consider the origin as a submanifold of @xmath110 . to blow up the origin ,",
    "we introduce polar coordinates @xmath111 , which corresponds to replacing the point @xmath112 with a quarter - circle , which corresponds to the inward - pointing spherical normal bundle of @xmath113 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and/or the appendix of @xcite for a more detailed explanation and more general examples of blow - ups .    by taylor s theorem ,",
    "smooth functions on a manifold with corners are precisely those functions which have taylor expansions at each boundary hypersurface and joint taylor expansions at every corner . _ polyhomogeneous conormal distributions",
    "_ , which we abbreviate as phg or phg conormal , are a generalization of smooth functions .",
    "in particular , if we let @xmath10 be a boundary defining function , we allow terms of the form @xmath114 for any @xmath115 and any @xmath116 to appear in the asymptotic expansions at the boundary and in the joint expansions at the corners .",

    "polyhomogeneous conormal functions are well - behaved under addition and multiplication , but also under more complicated operations , namely pull - back and push - forward .",

    "suppose that @xmath673 is in @xmath584 and satisfies @xmath674 .",
    "by regularity of solutions to b - elliptic equations , @xmath117 is phg conormal on @xmath0 near @xmath11 ; since @xmath675 , it decays to at least order @xmath35 at @xmath11 . on the other hand , since @xmath551 and @xmath676 , @xmath677 is in the kernel of @xmath541 , and hence @xmath678 . by the maximum principle , @xmath679 , which completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "the correct right inverse will be a slight modification of @xmath672 . in order to check consistency ,",
    "we need to understand the structure of @xmath672 near the front face ff = bf@xmath215zf .",
    "this structure is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , the leading order of @xmath672 at ff is precisely the indicial operator @xmath680 , which satisfies the equation @xmath681 moreover , from @xcite and @xcite , @xmath680 has polyhomogeneous expansions at @xmath682 and @xmath683 , with leading order terms at worst @xmath684 at each end ; that is , a small amount of growth is allowed at @xmath682 , and a small amount of decay is required at @xmath683 .",
    "we now separate variables and solve ( [ indicialeq ] ) directly .",
    "for each @xmath685 , @xmath686 span the kernel of @xmath687 .",
    "therefore , the solutions corresponding to @xmath626 are combinations of @xmath688 and @xmath689 away from @xmath690 . by the requirements at @xmath682 and @xmath683 ,",
    "our solution is a multiple of @xmath689 for @xmath691 and of @xmath688 for @xmath692 .",
    "using the matching conditions at @xmath690 arising from the delta function singularity , the solution on the eigenspace @xmath626 is @xmath693    we have to consider @xmath628 separately ; the kernel of @xmath694 is spanned by @xmath492 and @xmath695 . because we require decay at @xmath683 , the solution for @xmath691 must be zero .",
    "then the matching conditions at @xmath690 imply that the solution is @xmath695 for @xmath692 .",
    "since projection onto @xmath696 is simply @xmath697 , the zero - eigenspace solution is @xmath698 .",
    "therefore the leading order part of @xmath672 at ff is @xmath699    now compare ( [ indicialq ] ) with ( [ frombfo ] ) .",
    "let @xmath700 be a smooth cutoff function on @xmath0 , equal to 1 when @xmath701 $ ] and 0 whenever @xmath702 .",
    "we see immediately that if we let @xmath703 then @xmath704 and @xmath632 are consistent .",
    "additionally , @xmath603 solves the model problem @xmath705 at zf ; the key is that any function of @xmath271 is independent of @xmath706 and hence is in the kernel of @xmath707 .",
    "similarly , @xmath708 is in the kernel of @xmath709 and hence solves the model problem .. moreover , the diagonal symbol is consistent with @xmath710 for the same reason that it is consistent with @xmath631 and @xmath632 .      finally ,",
    "we need to specify the leading - order behavior of the parametrix at rb@xmath145 ; in fact , we need to specify some lower - order terms as well .",
    "we use the coordinates @xmath711 ; the @xmath712 face is rb@xmath215zf and the @xmath11 face is rb@xmath215bf@xmath145 .",
    "there will be a term @xmath713 for each @xmath714 in @xmath715 .",
    "the model problem near this face , with @xmath95 as a boundary defining function , is @xmath716 , so we need @xmath717 for each @xmath718 .",
    "first we focus on the model of order @xmath719 .",
    "we let @xmath720 and claim that this is consistent with @xmath721 and @xmath722 .",
    "to check consistency with @xmath721 , we need to show that the leading order of @xmath721 agrees with the leading order of @xmath723 at zf@xmath211rb@xmath145 . recall that at rb@xmath145 , which corresponds to @xmath204",
    ", @xmath672 decays to a positive order .",
    "so @xmath724 has leading order greater than @xmath719 at rb@xmath145 ; therefore , the leading order part of @xmath721 at rb@xmath145 is precisely @xmath725 but by bessel function asymptotics , @xmath726 therefore @xmath721 and @xmath727 are consistent .",
    "we must also check consistency of @xmath727 with @xmath722 .",
    "near rb@xmath145 , @xmath728 we are only interested in the order @xmath719 part of this term .",
    "since @xmath57 and @xmath636 both vanish to first order at rb@xmath145 , all the @xmath729 terms have leading order @xmath730 at rb@xmath145 .",
    "since @xmath731 , the order @xmath719 part of @xmath732 at rb@xmath145 is precisely @xmath733 we conclude that @xmath727 is consistent with the models at zf and bf@xmath145 .",
    "we also need to specify some lower order terms at @xmath734 ; for this we precisely follow section 4 of @xcite . at zf",
    ", they need to match with the asymptotics of @xmath672 , and at bf@xmath145 , they need to match with the higher order bessel functions . both of these involve only the nonzero indicial roots , so the terms and arguments are identical to @xcite .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath735 in the indicial set , we let @xmath736 where @xmath737 is in the kernel of @xmath548 with asymptotic @xmath738 the function @xmath739 is there to match with the asymptotics of @xmath740 at @xmath741 , as in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "in fact , these models are consistent with our models at bf@xmath145 and at zf by precisely the same argument as in @xcite ; we will not repeat it here .",
    "we have now constructed models at sc , bf@xmath145 , zf , and rb@xmath145 which are consistent with each other and also with the diagonal symbol . moreover , all the models decay to infinite order as we approach lb , rb , or bf .",
    "therefore , we specify our parametrix @xmath537 to be any pseudodifferential operator in @xmath742 with kernel having the specified diagonal symbol and specified leading - order terms at sc , bf@xmath145 , zf , and rb@xmath145 .",
    "the consistency we checked guarantees that such an operator exists .",
    "the behavior of the kernel of @xmath537 at lb@xmath145 may be freely chosen as long as the leading - order term is order @xmath719 and it matches with our models at zf and bf@xmath145 ; a term of order @xmath719 will , however , be required .",
    "now let @xmath743 .",
    "since @xmath537 has diagonal symbol equal to the inverse of the symbol of @xmath608 , the schwartz kernel of @xmath539 is smooth on the interior of @xmath189 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath608 is a differential operator , the schwartz kernel of @xmath539 is phg conormal on @xmath189 .    - at lb , rb , and bf , the schwartz kernel of @xmath537 vanishes to infinite order along with all derivatives , so the same is true of @xmath539 .    - at sc",
    ", @xmath744 solves the model problem , so @xmath539 has positive leading order at sc .    - at bf@xmath145 , @xmath537 has order @xmath745 , but @xmath722 solves the model problem , and moreover @xmath608 vanishes to second order . therefore @xmath539 has positive leading order at bf@xmath145 .",
    "- at zf , @xmath577 and @xmath746 solve the model problem , so @xmath539 has positive leading order .    - at lb@xmath145 , @xmath537 has order @xmath719 .",
    "the variables @xmath95 and @xmath10 both vanish at lb@xmath145 , so @xmath747 has order @xmath492 and @xmath748 has order @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath548 is a b - differential operator , @xmath749 also has order 0 , and hence @xmath750 has order 1 .",
    "since @xmath751 is supported away from lb@xmath145 , @xmath539 decays to at least order 1 at lb@xmath145 .",
    "- at rb@xmath145 , @xmath537 has order @xmath719 , but all the terms @xmath752 for @xmath753 solve the model problem .",
    "therefore , the error @xmath539 has leading order at worst 0 .    to summarize ,",
    "if @xmath754 is the index set for @xmath539 , we have shown : @xmath755    now we iterate away the error . by proposition",
    "[ composition ] , @xmath756 vanishes to positive order at all faces of @xmath155 ; suppose that the order of vanishing at each face is greater than @xmath71 .",
    "again applying proposition [ composition ] , we see that for each @xmath757 , the order of vanishing of @xmath758 and @xmath759 at each face of @xmath155 is greater than @xmath760 .",
    "therefore the neumann series @xmath761 may be summed asymptotically , and the sum defines an element of @xmath762 for some index family @xmath763 .",
    "finally , let @xmath764 ; we see that @xmath765 .",
    "since @xmath608 is invertible for all positive @xmath95 , its only right inverse is the resolvent .",
    "we conclude that @xmath766 is in fact the resolvent , and it is an element of @xmath767 for some index family @xmath768 .    in order to prove theorem [ dslow ] , we need to perform this construction for any angle @xmath769 , not just for @xmath533 . however , as guillarmou and hassell claim in @xcite , the construction is essentially unchanged .",
    "indeed , we just use @xmath770 as our boundary defining function for the @xmath543 faces instead of @xmath95 , and correspondingly change the model at @xmath771 from @xmath772 to @xmath773 .",
    "the construction is then precisely analogous to the @xmath533 case ; by construction , the index sets are independent of @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , by the continuity of the resolvent outside the spectrum ( also by construction ) , all the dependence on @xmath84 is smooth .",
    "this completes the proof .      since @xmath774",
    ", we can obtain some information about the leading orders of @xmath766 at each face . for @xmath80 ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the leading orders of @xmath766 are the same as those of @xmath537 ; we claim that the same is true when @xmath87 .    when @xmath87 , @xmath537 has leading orders @xmath719 at lb@xmath145 and rb@xmath145 , order 0 at sc , order -2 at bf@xmath145 , and logarithmic growth at zf .",
    "@xmath539 has non - negative leading orders at all faces , and it is easy to use proposition [ composition ] to show that the leading orders of @xmath775 are no worse than those of @xmath537 .",
    "similarly , it may be shown that the leading orders of @xmath776 are no worse than those of @xmath537 .",
    "since @xmath537 is fixed and @xmath777 is asymptotically summable , the series @xmath778 is also asymptotically summable ; therefore , the leading orders of @xmath766 are no worse than those of @xmath537 .",
    "the leading order terms themselves may be affected by @xmath775 , but the orders are not .    to summarize , when @xmath87 , the leading orders of the exact resolvent @xmath766 are no worse than 0 at sc , -2 at bf@xmath145 , logarithmic at zf , and @xmath719 at lb@xmath145 and rb@xmath145 .",
    "when @xmath80 , the orders are at worst 0 at sc , -2 at bf@xmath145 , 0 at zf , and @xmath779 at lb@xmath145 and rb@xmath145 , as in @xcite .",
    "however , these orders are for the resolvent acting on b - half - densities , rather than the more natural scattering half - densities .",
    "switching to scattering half - densities requires an order shift , adding @xmath780 at each of @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "so we need to add @xmath780 to the orders at lb@xmath145 and rb@xmath145 , and @xmath2 at bf@xmath145 .",
    "the order at sc remains unchanged , because the extra factor of @xmath564 in the definition of the calculus already incorporates the shift .",
    "so : viewing the resolvent as a scattering half - density @xmath781 acting on scattering half - densities for each @xmath95 , or equivalently as a function acting on functions on @xmath0 by integration against @xmath782 , it has leading orders given by :    * @xmath85 at sc and @xmath86 at bf@xmath145 , rb@xmath145 , and lb@xmath145 : * @xmath783 at zf , where @xmath784 if @xmath80 and @xmath785 ( that is , leading order behavior of @xmath786 ) if @xmath87 .",
    "albin has created a framework for the construction of the heat kernel on an asymptotically conic manifold ; essentially all of the hard work involved in this construction has already been done in @xcite . to complete the construction and prove theorem [ zshorttime ] ,",
    "all we need to do is create an initial parametrix for the heat kernel .",
    "this construction is the content of this short appendix and is based on section 5 of @xcite , in which albin constructs the heat kernel on an edge manifold .",
    "the space in theorem [ zshorttime ] , which we call @xmath787 , is obtained by taking the manifold @xmath788 and then blowing up the @xmath55 diagonal .",
    "we call the scattering face of @xmath788 sf and call the front face at @xmath55 ff .",
    "the heat operator is precisely @xmath789 .",
    "our goal is to create a parametrix which , to first order , solves the normal equations at sf and ff .",
    "first analyze the situation at sf . as first discussed in @xcite and elaborated upon in @xcite",
    ", sf has a euclidean structure , parametrized by @xmath456 and @xmath790 . by the same analysis as in @xcite , the normal operator at sf",
    "is precisely @xmath791 .",
    "we then simply let the model at sf be the euclidean heat kernel , @xmath792 .",
    "this is analogous to the construction in section 5 of @xcite for the edge setting , in which the model is the heat kernel on hyperbolic space times the heat kernel on the fiber .",
    "the analysis at ff is also standard , since ff corresponds to the short - time regime on the interior of the manifold , where the heat kernel asymptotics are local .",
    "we know that @xmath793 is a good coordinate along ff , zero at the spatial diagonal and increasing to infinity as we approach the original @xmath55 face .",
    "we therefore let the leading - order model at ff be @xmath794 the choice of model at ff is again based on the euclidean heat kernel , and is precisely the same as the choice of model in the edge setting @xcite .",
    "each model vanishes to infinite order as we approach all boundary hypersurfaces other than sf and ff .",
    "moreover , the models are consistent , as the leading orders of each are precisely the euclidean heat kernel at sf @xmath211 ff .",
    "we may therefore pick a pseudodifferential operator whose schwartz kernel agrees with our models to leading order at sf and ff , and decays to infinite order at all other boundary faces . in section 4 of @xcite , albin proves a composition rule for time - dependent pseudodifferential operators whose kernels are polyhomogeneous conormal on @xmath787 - our setting is the scattering setting , which is included in his analysis .",
    "we then use this composition rule and an iteration argument , precisely as in section 5 of @xcite , to construct the heat kernel as a polyhomogeneous conormal distribution on @xmath787 .",
