    "the strangeness - changing weak processes ( @xmath1 ) can be studied both in the semi - leptonic decays and strangeness - changing hadronic weak interactions . in contrast",
    ", the nuclear parity violation is almost the unique way to study the @xmath2 hadronic weak interaction experimentally .",
    "up to now , our knowledge on such processes is still relatively poor .",
    "the search for nuclear parity violation @xcite started shortly after the observation of the parity violation in nuclear beta decay @xcite .",
    "thereafter , there had been many experimental investigations of nuclear parity - violation such as the polarized proton - nucleus scattering , radiative @xmath3 capture , @xmath4 decay of nuclei , neutron spin rotation , and atomic parity - violation @xcite .",
    "the parity - violating ( pv ) effect is very small in nuclear processes .",
    "such an effect can be measured through the asymmetry of the cross - sections in the polarized experiments . in some heavy nuclei , there exist two energy levels with different parity which are very close to each other .",
    "the pv weak interaction mixes these two levels .",
    "then the asymmetry may be amplified .",
    "however , the few - body nuclear system provides a much cleaner place to study nuclear parity - violation though the asymmetry is only @xmath5 .",
    "experimental progress in this field is very encouraging .",
    "several years ago , the longitudinal analyzing power of @xmath6 scattering was measured at triumf @xcite .",
    "there are also on - going experiments to measure the photon asymmetry in radiative @xmath7 capture at lansce @xcite , the helicity asymmetry in the photodisintegration of deuterium at iasa @xcite , and the spin rotation of polarized neutrons in @xmath8he at nist @xcite",
    ".    strong interaction dominates the nucleon - nucleon interaction , which is repulsive at the short range .",
    "therefore the weak interactions between nucleons mediated directly by w and z bosons are strongly suppressed since the interaction range is around 0.002 fm . on the other hand , the meson nucleon interaction vertex can be parity - violating .",
    "thus one can study nuclear parity violation after replacing one strong vertex by the weak one in the meson exchange model .    historically , the study of nuclear parity - violation with the meson - exchange model started in 1964 @xcite .",
    "later , nuclear parity - violation was extensively studied in this framework @xcite . in 1980 ,",
    "desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) investigated the pv nuclear force in a general way and considered the exchanged mesons up to @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the ddh method has become a standard way in analyzing experiments since then . in that paper ,",
    "the pv vertices were parameterized with seven coupling constants : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath14 was found to be small and usually neglected @xcite .",
    "ddh estimated these coupling constants using the quark model and @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "they gave reasonable ranges for the couplings and presented their best guesses .",
    "surprisingly , various experimental constraints are more or less consistent with these ddh estimates , except that the bound on @xmath11 from nuclear anapole moment in cesium @xcite does not agree well with those from other experiments @xcite .    in the past decades",
    ", there has been important progress in the study of parity violation both in the single - nucleon case @xcite and @xmath16 system @xcite . in order to investigate nuclear parity violation in a model - independent way , zhu , maekawa , holstein , ramsey - musolf and van kolck reformulated the pv nucleon - nucleon interaction in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite . at very low energy ,",
    "the momenta of external fields are very small and the pion can be integrated out .",
    "eft without explicit pions is appropriate .",
    "when the external momenta are comparable with the pion mass , eft with explicit pions is necessary .    for the description of pv nn forces in eft with explicit pions ,",
    "the treatment is similar to the study of parity - conserving ( pc ) nn force in eft @xcite .",
    "one simply replaces one pc vertex with one pv vertex and imposes chiral symmetry on the pv vertex . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pv potential was calculated to @xmath17 in weinberg s power counting where @xmath18 is the typical scale of the processes .",
    "the leading order ( @xmath19 ) result reproduced the pion exchange part of ddh formalism . at the next leading order ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "explicit computation shows there is in fact no contribution . at the third order ,",
    "the short range potential was described with contact interactions .",
    "the medium range potential was deduced from two - pion exchange interactions while the long range potential was obtained by considering corrections to the one - pion exchange interaction . in this framework ,",
    "@xcite studied a minimal set of parameters to describe low - energy pv observables . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied pv asymmetry in @xmath21 within eft .",
    "the decuplet baryon @xmath0 couples to @xmath22 strongly .",
    "the virtual @xmath0 may aslo contribute to the pv nucleon - nucleon interactions , which was noted long time ago in refs .",
    "the ddh formalism was extended to investigate the effects due to @xmath0 @xcite . with development of the modern eft language",
    ", we will extend the former work @xcite and calculate the pv potential by considering @xmath0 as an explicit degree of freedom in eft in the present work .",
    "the present work was part of y. r. liu s thesis submitted in april , 2007 .",
    "it is interesting to note that an independent work dealing with similar topics appeared recently @xcite .",
    "however the way to derive the potential in this work is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the calculation of the longitudinal asymmetry in @xmath23 by including @xmath24 exchange effects which include @xmath16 and @xmath25 intermediate states is presented .    in order to include the @xmath0 degree of freedom systematically",
    ", we employ the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory with @xmath0 .",
    "the expansion scheme was called the small scale expansion ( sse ) @xcite , which was widely used to study the processes involving @xmath0 @xcite . both the pion mass and the mass difference between nucleon and @xmath0 isobar",
    "are counted as the order @xmath17 .",

    ", we present the relevant lagrangian . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we calculate pv potentials due to the virtual @xmath0 baryon .",
    "the final section is a short summary .",
    "in the eft study of the nucleon - nucleon potential , one performs a systematic expansion of lagrangians and amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we present relevant lagrangians @xmath26 in this section .",
    "they are grouped with chiral index @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of derivatives and powers of the pion mass and @xmath29 the number of fermion fields .",
    "when we consider the @xmath0 contribution to the parity - violating potential up to the third order @xmath17 , we need only the lowest order chiral lagrangians .    for the @xmath30 interaction ,",

    "the quark model gives the relation @xmath49 .",
