    "the nearest elliptical galaxy available for study is m32 , a companion to m31 .",
    "because m32 has a high surface brightness that is centrally concentrated , a near - solar metallicity , and a predominantly old population , it is usually considered a `` compact elliptical '' galaxy , as opposed to a `` dwarf elliptical '' or `` dwarf spheroidal '' ( see da costa 1997 ) . due to its proximity",
    "( 770 kpc ) , space - based observations are able to resolve individual cool stars near its center .",
    "hot stars can also be detected in the center itself , because they are relatively rare , so crowding is not serious , and because the cooler , dominant populations are suppressed in the solar - blind uv bandpasses . because m32 can be studied through colors , spectra , luminosity functions , and color - magnitude diagrams , it represents a natural benchmark in our understanding of elliptical galaxies .",
    "stellar population studies of m32 at optical and infrared wavelengths have shown no evidence for an extended horizontal branch ( hb ) ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) , and population synthesis work often assumes that the galaxy has a `` red clump '' hb +    @xmath5based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas  5 - 26555 .",
    "@xmath6 noao research associate .     + morphology ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ) . in the ultraviolet ,",
    "brown et al .  ( 1998 ) found indirect evidence for an extended hb in m32 : the uv - bright post - hb stars apparently follow evolutionary tracks originating from the hot end of the hb . in spectral synthesis studies ,",
    "the assumption of a red clump hb morphology contributes to the need for an intermediate - age component to the stellar population , to provide the necessary ultraviolet flux ( see grillmair et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) . direct proof of an extended hb would therefore relax the requirement that m32 has a composite population , with a dominant old component ( of age 8 gyr or more ) , and a minority younger component ( of age @xmath75 gyr ) .",
    "considered as an extreme case in the sequence of true elliptical galaxies , m32 has the weakest uv - to - optical flux ratio measured to date ( @xmath8 mag ; burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) . known as the uv upturn , the sharp rise in the spectra of elliptical galaxies at wavelengths shorter than 2500  ",
    "was discovered with the oao-2 satellite ( code 1969 ) .",
    "prior to this discovery , researchers did not expect such a uv - bright component in supposedly old , passively - evolving populations .",
    "many candidates were suggested to explain the upturn , including young massive stars , hot white dwarfs , hot hb and post - hb stars , and non - thermal activity ( for a complete review , see greggio & renzini 1990 ; oconnell 1999 ) . as the measurements of local ellipticals were expanded , iue observations demonstrated a large variation in the strength of the uv upturn from galaxy to galaxy , even though the spectra of ellipticals appear very similar at longer wavelengths .",
    "characterized by the @xmath9 color , the uv upturn becomes stronger and bluer as the metallicity ( optical mg@xmath10 index ) of the galaxy increases , while visible colors become redder ( burstein et al.1988 ) .",
    "today , it is widely believed that hb stars and their progeny are responsible for the far - uv emission in elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are three classes of post - hb evolution , each evolving from a different range of effective temperature on the zero - age hb ( zahb ; see figure 1 ) .",
    "following core helium exhaustion , stars on the red end of the hb will evolve up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , undergo thermal pulses , evolve as bright post - agb stars to hotter temperatures , possibly form planetary nebulae , and eventually descend the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling curve . at hotter temperatures ( and lower envelope masses ) on the hb",
    ", stars will follow post - early agb evolution : they evolve up the agb , but leave the agb before the thermal pulsing phase , continue to high temperatures at high luminosity , and descend the wd cooling curve .",
    "the bluest hb stars , with very little envelope mass , will follow agb - manqu@xmath11 evolution , evolving directly to hotter temperatures and brighter luminosities without ever ascending the agb , and finally descending the wd cooling curve .",
    "these three classes of post - hb behavior have very different lifetimes , in the sense that the post - agb stars are bright in the uv for a brief period ( @xmath12 yr ) , the post - early agb stars are uv - bright for a longer period ( @xmath13 yr ) , and the agb - manqu@xmath11 stars are uv - bright for very long periods ( @xmath14 yr ) .",
    "the hb phase itself lasts @xmath15  yr , and so the presence of hot hb stars in a population , combined with their long - lived uv - bright progeny , can produce the strong uv upturn seen in the most massive , metal - rich ellipticals ( see dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 and references therein ) . in galaxies with a weak uv upturn , a significant fraction of the far - uv flux can theoretically come from post - agb stars ( see brown et al .",
    "1997 ) , and in the weakest uv upturn galaxies  such as m32  the spectra alone do not require the presence of a hot hb .",
    "the zahb is not only a sequence in effective temperature : it is also a sequence in mass ( see dorman , rood , & oconnell 1993 ) . for @xmath16",
    "k , a small change in envelope mass ( @xmath17  @xmath18 ) corresponds to a large change in t@xmath19 ( @xmath20  k ) , assuming solar abundances . because the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) mass decreases as age increases , the zahb will become bluer as a population ages , assuming all other parameters ( e.g. , mass loss on the red giant branch , metallicity , helium abundance , etc . )",
    "remain fixed . note that this does not necessarily imply that age is the `` second parameter '' of hb morphology ( e.g. , fusi pecci & bellazzini 1997 ; vandenberg 1999 ; sweigart 1999 ) .",
    "the assumed first parameter of the hb morphology debate is metallicity ; the hb becomes bluer at lower metallicity , assuming all other parameters ( age , mass loss , etc . )",
    "remain fixed .",
    "this is due to two reasons .",
    "first , the msto mass at a given age is lower at lower metallicity , because a metal - poor star is more luminous ( and thus shorter - lived ) than a metal - rich star of the same mass .",
    "second , as the metallicity decreases , the envelope opacity decreases , leading to a higher effective temperature on the hb . in short , hb morphology tends to become bluer at lower metallicity and higher ages , but other parameters may also play a role ( rotation , he abundance , deep mixing , etc . ) .",
    "although hb morphology in globular clusters ( gcs ) tends to become redder at increasing metallicity , there are examples of relatively metal - rich gcs with extended blue hbs ( e.g. , rich et al .",
    "1997 ) , leading to the `` second parameter '' debate .",
    "although elliptical galaxies should not be considered as overgrown globular clusters , they are generally believed to be metal - rich , old populations , and thus the presence of a hot hb in m32 can provide further insight into the production of blue hbs .",
    "m32 has been the subject of several uv imaging programs with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the earliest of these observations ( king et al .  1992 ; bertola et al .",
    "1995 ) were taken with the faint object camera ( foc ) before the correction of the spherical aberration , and were subject to large photometric uncertainties due to the calibration and aperture corrections .",
    "after the hst refurbishment with costar , brown et al.(1998 ) also observed m32 with the foc , and detected the uv - bright post - hb phases of stars descended from the hot hb ; although the calibration was improved in these later observations , the foc was still subject to considerable uncertainties , such as an unexplained format dependence to the photometric zero points , and red leak . here , we describe the deep uv imaging of m32 performed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , a 2nd - generation hst instrument with a vastly improved performance and calibration .",
    "our image is sufficiently deep to reach the hb at temperatures hotter than 8500  k , and in fact does reveal the presence of these stars , providing the first direct detection of hot hb stars in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "we interpret our data with a new set of evolutionary tracks , and compare our results to expectations from canonical tracks in the literature .",
    "stis observed m32 on 19 october and 21 october 1998 , with four exposures on each day ; the total exposure of the summed images is 22962 sec .",
    "the combined image , shown with a logarithmic stretch to enhance the faint stars , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the data were taken with the near - uv multi - anode microchannel array ( nuvmama ) , using the crystal quartz filter ( f25qtz ) ; the filter blocks light shortward of 1450    and thus reduces the sky background from terrestrial airglow lines of and lyman @xmath21 .",
    "the long wavelength cutoff of the bandpass is 3500   , due to the sensitivity of the detector , and red leak at longer wavelengths is minimal ( baum et al.1998 ) .",
    "the stis mamas are photon counters that register less than one count per incident cosmic ray ; thus , cosmic ray rejection is not required , as it is with ccd imaging ( where an incident cosmic ray causes a massive many - count `` hit '' ) .",
    "a full description of the instrument and its capabilities can be found in woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kimble et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 ( @xmath23 pixel ) field was centered 7.7@xmath24 south of the m32 center , in order to overlap with earlier foc uv imaging of m32 ( brown et al .",
    "1998 ) , to allow imaging in regions of lower diffuse galaxy background while still including the center of the galaxy , and to place the field farther from m31 .",
    "the images were dithered between three positions along the x / y diagonal of the detector : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "given the plate scale of 24.465 mas pix@xmath28 , these offsets were equivalent to shifts of @xmath299 pixels along each axis of the detector , which is useful for smoothing out small - scale variations in detector sensitivity .",
    "a small fraction of the field near the detector edge is occulted by a scattered - light mask very close to the focal plane : the lower right corner ( @xmath299000 pixels ) , the upper right corner ( @xmath292700 pixels ) , the bottom 20 rows , the first 8 columns , the top row , and last 4 columns .",
    "although the mask slightly decreases the field of view , it does not vignette stars in the remainder of the field , and it does allow an accurate characterization of the dark counts in the data .    the stis focal plane is tilted with respect to the detector when in imaging mode ( stis is optimized for spectroscopy ) .",
    "thus , the psf changes in shape and width as one moves from left to right in the field , and it also changes in time due to telescope breathing .",
    "our final summed image averages over time to produce a psf that is very nearly circular in the left half of the image , and noticeably elliptical in the right half of the image .",
    "our detection limits are driven by the combination of both focus and galaxy background . in this image ,",
    "the focus is best where the diffuse background from the core of m32 is faintest .",
    "this combination makes the limiting sensitivity significantly + 2.15 in non - uniform over the summed image , but provides the deepest possible sensitivity in the well - focussed portions of the image .",
    "an elliptical gaussian fit to isolated bright stars in the field has a fwhm range of 2.423.96 pix ( 0.060.1@xmath24 ) , and an axial ratio range of 0.640.95 .",
    "we detect @xmath78000 stars in the near - uv . because the image contains @xmath30 resolution elements ( in the regions where we are actually cataloging stars ) ,",
    "this is obviously a crowded field , with an average of one star per 30 resolution elements ; near the m32 center , the crowding is severe , with one star per 12 resolution elements , but farther from the center it drops to one star per 63 resolution elements . the combination of this crowding with the variable psf and the variable galaxy background makes photometry difficult , but not impossible , as we will discuss below .",
    "although the internal interstellar extinction within m32 is unknown , it is presumably small in comparison to the galactic foreground extinction , thought to be anywhere in the range @xmath31 mag ( tully 1988 ; mcclure & racine 1969 ; burstein et al .",
    "1988 ; ferguson & davidsen 1993 ; burstein & heiles 1984 ) . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath32  mag when comparing the data to the predictions of stellar evolutionary tracks , corresponding to 0.8 mag of extinction in the stis bandpass .    of the @xmath33 stars resolved in the stis image , four of the brightest",
    "roughly coincide with the positions of the only known planetary nebulae ( ciardullo et al .",
    "1989 ) in this field .",
    "specifically , if one takes their positions in the simbad database , there is a very bright star in the stis image approximately 1@xmath24 west of each position , implying that there is a global offset between the astrometry of our image and that of the planetary nebulae .",
    "these stars are flagged in our catalog ( table 1 , available from the cds ) , and their positions are marked in fig  3 .",
    "we reduced the raw images via the calstis package in iraf , including an updated pixel - to - pixel flat field file .",
    "two steps in the reduction were done outside of calstis : geometric correction was applied during the final combination via the iraf drizzle package , and dark subtraction was performed by subtracting a scaled and flat - fielded dark image from each data frame , with the scaling determined from the occulted right - hand corners of the detector .",
    "all frames were cross - correlated to provide accurate relative shifts .",
    "the calibrated frames were then drizzled to a @xmath34 pixel image that included the data from all dither positions .",
    "the resulting image has a narrow strip of underexposed pixels along the edges , due to the dither     +   +   + pattern .",
    "this strip is scaled correctly to account for the smaller exposure time , but thus has higher noise than the fully exposed area of the image .",
    "stars in the underexposed strip are not included in our catalog , and this strip was not included in the monte carlo simulations discussed in  [ seccom ] and  [ secspur ] .",
    "the drizzle `` dropsize '' ( also known as pixfrac ) was 0.1 , thus improving the resolution over a dropsize of 1.0 ( which would be equivalent to simple shift - and - add ) .",
    "this small dropsize does not cause problematic `` holes '' in the final image , because the pixel scale was unchanged ; it is thus equivalent to interlacing the individual frames . in the final image , pixels outside of the dither pattern or occulted",
    "are set to a count rate of zero .",
    "the pixel mask used in the drizzle for each input frame included the occulted regions of the detector , a small number of hot pixels , and pixels with relatively low response ( those with values @xmath35 in the pixel - to - pixel flat field ) .",
    "because the m32 image is fairly crowded , there are two obvious options for performing photometry : psf fitting or small - aperture photometry .",
    "however , the psf also varies strongly with position in the image , and so the aperture correction for small - aperture photometry would be a strong function of position , possibly introducing systematic errors in our catalog .",
    "we felt that psf fitting offered the most accuracy for these data .",
    "as an initial estimate of the psf variation , we used the iraf routine fitpsf to fit an elliptical gaussian to 180 of the brightest isolated stars in the image .",
    "the result defined a map of the gaussian semi - major axis width as a function of position in the image .",
    "the map confirmed that the psf varies as a function of horizontal position .    for our psf fitting",
    ", we used the january 1998 version of the daophot - ii package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the software allows calculation of relative photometry with a variable psf defined by the user .",
    "our iterative procedure was similar to that described in the user s manual , to which we refer interested readers for details .",
    "however , because the psf and the diffuse background from unresolved stars both vary with position , we chose to perform our photometry on six image regions ( defined in table 2 ) .",
    "object detection and psf fitting for each region were done with the region boundaries extended 50 pixels into the neighboring regions , to avoid edge effects with stars near the region boundaries .",
    "thus , at each region boundary , there is a 100-pixel wide strip where stars are fit twice , and we use this + 2.4 in    -0.2 in 0.1 in    overlap to put the stars in each region on the same magnitude system ( see below ) .",
    "each region spanned the entire height of the image , with region 5 encompassing the center of the galaxy . from our initial map of elliptical gaussian fits",
    ", we determined the `` average '' width of a star in each region ( table 2 ) , and used this width for object detection .",
    "daophot convolves an image with a gaussian as part of its object detection algorithm , but the user must specify a constant width for each image under consideration .",
    "thus , our use of a different width for each region allows optimization of the object detection .    to determine a variable psf for each region , we first subtracted a median - filtered image from the data to remove the varying galaxy background .",
    "we found that this subtraction prevented a spurious biasing of the psf wings ; fitting the psf with the galaxy background intact incorrectly tilts the psf wings along the slope of the galaxy background .",
    "our psf in each region is a moffat function with a lookup table of empirical corrections .",
    "the psf in each region was allowed to vary linearly with position .",
    "although daophot allows quadratic variations in the psf , our psf subtraction was worsened when we attempted to allow such higher order variation .",
    "the psf determination was done though an interactive selection of the brightest isolated stars , with iterations to subtract the psfs of the neighboring stars , as described in the manual for the software .",
    "the psf was defined with a radius of 10 pixels .    after determining a variable psf for each image region , we performed object detection and psf fitting on the data , again using the regions defined in table 2  ( but without the galaxy background subtraction ) . to maintain positional consistency",
    ", we did not actually extract the regions from the image ; we simply set those pixels outside of a given region to a `` bad '' pixel value , thus producing a mask for each region . in region 5 , which contains the m32 center , we also masked off a @xmath36 ellipse aligned to the axis of m32 ( 45@xmath37 counterclockwise from the + y axis of the image ) , in order to prevent an unnecessary biasing of the `` sky '' level , and because the very center appeared hopelessly crowded . in the final catalog",
    ", we actually rejected stars in a larger @xmath38 ellipse , after reevaluating the severity of the crowding .",
    "we set the detection threshold to 5  @xmath39 ; setting a lower threshold produces many false detections , because the diffuse background varies with position , even within the subsections we defined .",
    "the detection algorithm convolves the image with a symmetrical gaussian with a width equal to the fwhm of the psf , and then looks for deviations above the local sky background ( see stetson 1987 for a complete description ) .",
    "we set the `` roundness '' and `` sharpness '' criteria to twice their default values , because the stis psf is not symmetrical and there is no need to reject cosmic rays in stis mama images .",
    "after a first pass of object detection and psf fitting , the star - subtracted image is used for a second pass at object detection , and the final combined catalog is used for a second pass of psf fitting .",
    "the psfs were fit to the stars using a fitting radius of 3 pixels and a sky annulus spanning 815 pixels in radius .",
    "the daophot package is capable of iteratively solving for the sky under the star itself ( hence the inner radius of the sky annulus falls within the psf radius ) .",
    "daophot calculates the _ relative _ magnitudes of stars in each region . putting all of the stars in each region on the same system required several additional steps",
    "the psf in region 2 is the most circular and has the smallest fwhm .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the 10 brightest stars in region 2 , with the aperture varying from 310 pixels in radius .",
    "next , we performed the same aperture photometry on the quasar in the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) near - uv image ( gardner et al .",
    "the encircled - energy variation with aperture size in our m32 image was nearly identical to that of the quasar .",
    "we then used the quasar ( with object masking for the other galaxies in the hdf - s ) to determine an aperture correction of 0.524 mag for a 3-pixel radius aperture , and used this aperture correction to calculate the corrected magnitudes of the 10 bright stars in m32 .",
    "this then determined the zero - point for the daophot magnitudes in region 2 .",
    "next , we used the 100-pixel - wide overlaps at region boundaries ( see above ) to place all of the stars on the same magnitude system as region 2 ; the photometry in each region was shifted by less than 0.1 mag as part of this correction .",
    "our magnitudes are specified in the stmag system : + @xmath40 @xmath41    where exptime is the exposure time , and photflam is @xmath42 erg s@xmath28 cm@xmath6 @xmath28 / ( cts s@xmath28 ) .",

    ", we ran thousands of monte carlo simulations , using the daophot package and our own idl - based programs . for each region ,",
    "10 stars at a given magnitude were placed within the region at random positions , using the variable psf for that region , and including poisson noise in the artificial stars .",

    "because these test psfs were not as strongly peaked , they could possibly reduce the detectability .",

    "we resolve @xmath710% of the near - uv flux in most of the image , and about a third of the near - uv flux in the deepest section .",

    "before comparing our luminosity functions to the expectations from stellar evolutionary tracks , it is important to place constraints on the population under consideration . we can not have an arbitrary number of stars leaving the msto and eventually passing through the hb phase ; the bolometric luminosity of the population and the stellar lifetimes constrain the number of stars in a given evolutionary phase ( greggio & renzini 1990 ; renzini 1998 ) . the stellar death rate , or stellar evolutionary flux ( sef ) ,",

    "several recent investigations of the agb tip luminosity in m32 show there is a significant population of stars on the agb at luminosities brighter than the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) ( see grillmair et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) .",
    "however , earlier studies that found very bright agb stars , like those associated with young populations , were apparently affected by crowding ; instead , it appears that the bright agb stars in m32 belong to a population of long period variables ( lpvs ) and blue - straggler progeny , like those found in the old metal - rich globular clusters 47 tuc and ngc6553 ( guarnieri , renzini , & ortolani 1997 ; renzini 1998 ; grillmair et al .",
    "note that in a solar - metallicity population of age 8 gyr , the rgb tip lies at @xmath93 ( bertelli et al.1994 ) .",
    "the lack of bright agb stars associated with young populations supports the premise that the majority of the post - agb stars in m32 should be evolving along low - mass tracks ( near this luminosity ) .    until the middle of this decade",
    ", post - agb stars were thought to be predominantly h - burning ( see vassiliadis & wood 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "h - burning post - agb stars leave the agb between he - shell flashes , while he - burning post - agb stars leave the agb near or during a flash , and the ratio of he - burning to h - burning lifetimes over the he - shell flash cycle was thought to be on the order of 20% .",
    "however , vassiliadis & wood ( 1994 ) suggested that at lower masses , the chance of producing a he - burning post - agb star increased ( see also renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; renzini 1989 ) .",
    "post - agb evolution remains as one of the least - understood phases of normal stellar evolution ; more observational evidence is needed to determine the relative frequency of h - burning and he - burning tracks ( see dopita , jacoby , & vassiliadis 1992 ) .",
    "+    m32 has a very weak uv upturn , and thus , prior to our observations , the uv flux could theoretically be explained by low - mass post - agb stars alone ; no hot hb stars were required .",
    "we know that hot hb stars , if present , can only comprise a minority of the population , else the uv upturn in m32 would be considerably stronger ; the elliptical galaxies with the strongest uv upturns only require @xmath94% of the sef to pass through the hot hb and its descendants ( brown et al .",
    "we expect most of the stars in m32 to pass through the red end of the hb and the subsequent low - mass post - agb tracks .",
    "while post - agb stars evolve very rapidly through their uv - bright phases compared to the hot hb stars and their progeny ( see  [ secint ] ) , the low - mass post - agb tracks nevertheless evolve slowly enough to produce dozens of stars at very bright magnitudes in the stis bandpass .",
    "this is shown in table 7 , which shows the luminosity functions obtained by placing the entire sef ( determined for @xmath69 in  [ secsef ] ) into selected low - mass tracks from the literature .",
    "for comparison , we show the raw and corrected luminosity functions obtained in the deepest half of the stis image , @xmath69 ( see  [ secsef ] ) .",
    "it is obvious from table 7that low - mass h - burning tracks suffer from two problems when trying to explain the stis luminosity function : the models predict far too many stars at bright magnitudes ( @xmath95 mag ) and far too few stars at faint magnitudes ( @xmath96 mag ) , even when the faint magnitudes are not corrected for completeness .",
    "low - mass he - burning post - agb tracks fair somewhat better with the bright end of the stis luminosity function , as they do not predict nearly as many bright stars , but these tracks still produce far too few stars at faint magnitudes .",
    "these he - burning tracks also produce a fairly bright local maximum in their luminosity functions ( see table  7 ) that is not seen in the stis data , but the luminosity of this phase depends upon the mass and the details of the evolution .",
    "thus this spike in the lf could be easily hidden in the stis data if there was a small dispersion in post - agb mass , centered at a low mass ( @xmath97  @xmath18 ) .",
    "the lack of uv - bright stars in the stis data requires that the transition from the agb to @xmath98  k occurs on a much more rapid timescale than predicted by the low - mass h - burning tracks , or , alternatively , that this transition be hidden by circumstellar dust produced during the preceding agb mass - loss ( see    figure  6 ) .",
    "if the transition is only accelerated up to a somewhat cooler temperature ( e.g. , 30000  k or 50000  k ) , there will still be too many stars in the lf bins brighter than 23.5 mag .",
    "the pace of this transition is naturally increased by assuming post - agb tracks of higher mass ( @xmath99 @xmath90 ) , but , as we stated above , the observational and theoretical evidence on the maximum agb stellar luminosity seems to preclude this option .",
    "furthermore , the agb precursors of a population of stars this massive would produce an enormous amount of energy , leading to optical - infrared colors in disagreement with observations ( greggio & renzini 1999 ) .",
    "circumstellar extinction , while having a strong effect in the uv , would also appear to be an unlikely candidate , considering the rapid thinning times for material surrounding post - agb stars ( k@xmath100ufl , renzini , & stanghellini 1993 ; brown et al .",
    "1998 ) , although we can not rule out this alternative .",
    "the most likely explanation for the lack of bright stars is that most of the population evolves more rapidly from the agb to high effective temperature than predicted by the tracks in tables 6  and 7 .",
    "this might occur if the final mass ejection on the agb was triggered by a helium - shell flash which left the star out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the post - agb evolution would then take place on the more rapid thermal timescale , as argued by k@xmath100ufl et al.(1993 ) and greggio & renzini ( 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , table 7  already demonstrates that the discrepancy with the stis data is greatly reduced if the stars evolve as he - burners .",
    "note that the number of known planetary nebulae in the stis field ( four ) , combined with the stellar evolutionary flux for the entire stis field ( @xmath87 star yr@xmath28 ) , implies that the planetary nebula phase only lasts for @xmath101  yr .",
    "although we might have an explanation for the lack of bright stars , there is no post - agb track that can produce the thousands of stars on the faint end of the stis luminosity function , and so we next explore the expectations from hot horizontal branch stars and their progeny .      as explained in ",
    "[ secint ] , the hb phase ( shown as a light grey region in figures 1  and 7 ) lasts for @xmath102 yr , and the uv - bright post - hb lifetime for stars leaving the hot end of the hb is on the order of @xmath103 yr .",
    "these long lifetimes in the uv suggest that hot hb stars and their progeny are much more likely to explain the stis luminosity function , compared to the brighter short - lived post - agb stars .",
    "we explore this possibility here , using our own calculations of hb and post - hb evolution .",
    "we have calculated a detailed grid of hb and post - hb sequences with solar metallicity and helium abundance , over a wide range in the hb mass , and for various rates of mass loss along the agb .",
    "a fine spacing in the hb mass was used , in order to clearly define the changes in the hb morphology with mass , as well as the transition between the agb - manqu@xmath11 , post - early - agb , and post - agb evolution .",
    "evolution was followed from the zahb until the luminosity fell below 0.1 @xmath85 along the white dwarf cooling curve . in a few cases",
    ", the models underwent a final helium - shell flash while descending the wd cooling curve , and such sequences were stopped if the flash convection reached into the hydrogen envelope .    in order to obtain a zahb model at the red end of the hb",
    ", we first evolved a 1 @xmath90 stellar model from the zero - age main sequence up the rgb , and then through the helium - core flash .",
    "the parameters of the initial main - sequence model were determined by calibrating the model on the sun ; i.e. , the main sequence helium abundance @xmath104 , heavy - element abundance @xmath105 , and mixing - length ratio @xmath21 were adjusted until the model matched the observed solar luminosity , radius , and @xmath106 ratio at a solar age of 4.6 gyr .",
    "the parameters derived in this fashion are : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the helium abundance increased to 0.3003 during the first dredge - up along the lower rgb .",
    "consequently , all of the hb and agb sequences we have computed have the following envelope abundances : @xmath110 and @xmath108 .",
    "mass loss was included during the rgb phase using the reimers ( 1975 ) mass - loss formulation , with a mass - loss parameter @xmath111 of 0.4 . as a result ,",
    "the mass decreased to 0.8269 @xmath90 by the time the model reached the zahb .",
    "the age at that time was 12.2 gyr .",
    "the use of a somewhat different initial mass ( corresponding to a somewhat different age ) would have only a negligible effect on the core mass and envelope helium abundance of this zahb model .",
    "thus our results do not depend significantly on the choice for the zero - age main sequence model .",
    "lower mass zahb models were then computed by removing mass from the envelope of the red zahb model described above .",
    "the lowest zahb mass considered here was 0.473 @xmath90 , corresponding to an envelope mass of only 0.00162 @xmath90 .",
    "the zahb models computed in this manner were then evolved through the hb phase using standard algorithms for convective overshooting and semiconvection .",
    "the last model from each hb sequence was then used as the starting model for the subsequent agb evolution .",
    "mass loss was included in the agb sequences , using the reimers ( 1975 ) formulation for three values of @xmath111 : 0.0 ( no mass loss ) , 0.4 , and 1.0 .",
    "note that these assumptions for agb mass loss have no consequence for the agb - manqu@xmath11 evolution , because such stars do not ascend the agb ( see  [ secint ] ) .",
    "for this reason , and because we lack color information for these stars ( given the one bandpass of our observations ) , we will only explore the models that assume @xmath112 in our discussion below . the variation in mass loss",
    "may be explored in future work if color information becomes available for these stars .",
    "the set of tracks with @xmath112 consisted of 35 zahb masses ( m@xmath113 ) , ranging from 0.473 to 0.700 @xmath90 and covering a temperature range from @xmath114 4.42  3.67 . due to mass loss on the agb ,",
    "the final masses on the white dwarf cooling curve ( @xmath115 ) for these tracks is somewhat less .",

    "these tracks permit the transition between the different classes of post - hb evolution to be much better defined than previously possible .",
    "figure 7  shows examples of these evolutionary tracks as they appear in the stis bandpass ( see also figure 1 ) .",
    "we have constructed the luminosity functions for each of the above hb and post - hb tracks in the stis bandpass for comparison with the corrected stis luminosity function given in table 7 . because we only have one bandpass and no color information , it is difficult to constrain the mass distribution of stars on the hot hb .",
    "this difficulty is further compounded by the fact that post - agb stars certainly contribute some small but non - negligible component to the stis luminosity function , because we know the majority of the evolved population passes through some sort of post - agb phase , given the weak uv upturn in m32 .",
    "color information would also help to separate these post - agb stars from the rest of the stis data , because they spend most of their time at much higher effective temperature .",
    "the luminosity functions for four of our tracks can be added to create a composite luminosity function that agrees quite well with the stis data ( figure 5 ) .",
    "two of these tracks follow agb - manqu@xmath11 evolution and two follow post - early agb evolution upon leaving the hb .",
    "these tracks have been normalized to maximize agreement with the stis data from 2327 mag , and we show in table 8  the relative contributions of these tracks to this composite lf . we stress that this lf serves as an example , to show that hot hb stars can reproduce the stis luminosity function ; color information is required to properly constrain the true distribution of mass on the hot hb .",
    "the stis data confirm that stars passing through the hot hb at @xmath121  k comprise only a small fraction ( approximately 7% ) of the total hb population in m32 .",
    "this fraction of hot hb stars would be somewhat lower if the contribution of the post - agb stars could be subtracted from the stis luminosity function .    given the small fraction of the population entering the hot hb , we must conclude that the vast majority of the population passes through the red hb phase and the subsequent post - agb evolution .",
    "although a small population of hot hb stars can explain the numerous faint stars present in the stis image , we still must explain the lack of bright stars .",
    "the likely explanation , as discussed in  [ secpagb ] , is that the transition time from the agb to the hotter post - agb phases must be more rapid than that expected from the canonical low - mass h - burning tracks .",

    "in the galactic field , hot hb and post - hb stars are often found in binaries , and it has been suggested that a dynamical mechanism may play a role in the production of hot hb stars in old , metal - rich populations such as elliptical galaxies ( green et al.1997 ; green & chaboyer 1998 ) . in globular clusters ,",
    "the role of dynamics remains a matter of debate .",
    "horizontal branch morphology tends to become redder as metallicity increases , but examples of metal - rich gcs with blue hb morphology demonstrate that other parameters are at work ( e.g. , rich et al.1997 ) .",
    "one of these parameters may be a dynamical mechanism , through binary or tidal interaction while on the rgb .",
    "there is some evidence that dynamics plays a role in hb morphology ; e.g. , fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and buonanno et al.(1997 ) demonstrated that more concentrated clusters have bluer hb morphologies with extended blue tails .",
    "rich et al.(1997 ) found two metal - rich gcs with extended hb morphology ( ngc6388 and ngc6441 ) , although the evidence for a dynamical origin in that work appears inconclusive .",
    "these clusters have some of the highest values of central surface brightness , velocity dispersion , and stellar collision rates for galactic gcs , which may partially explain their blue hbs , but rich et al.(1997 ) find no evidence for a difference in the radial distribution of blue and red hb stars , as expected if tidal or binary interaction plays a role . later work by layden et al.(1999 ) did find that the blue hb stars in ngc6441 were more centrally concentrated than the red hb stars , but the difference in these gradients does not conform with theoretical expectations for a dynamical mechanism , because it occurs too far from the cluster center . in ngc6752 ,",
    "landsman et al .  (",
    "1996 ) found that the hot hb is a continuous extension of the intermediate - temperature hb population , suggesting that a common single - star mechanism is responsible for both . in @xmath122 cen , which has the largest known fraction of hot hb stars , dcruz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find no evidence for a radial gradient in the hot hb to red hb number ratio .",
    "m32 is much smaller than other well - studied true ellipticals , and it has the lowest mg@xmath10 optical metallicity index of all the quiescent uv upturn galaxies in the burstein et al .",
    "( 1988 ) sample ; in this sense , it is the elliptical galaxy that lies closest to the realm of globular clusters .",
    "however , elliptical galaxies should not be considered as overgrown globular clusters  they clearly inhabit a different regime of parameter space , especially when considering the evolved population of stars that produces the uv upturn .",
    "this is apparent in the modified version of the burstein et al .",
    "( 1988 ) @xmath9 vs. mg@xmath10 relation shown by dorman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which shows the gcs lying in a completely distinct clump removed from the tight e galaxy sequence .",
    "it is thus worth noting that the existence of hot hb stars in m32 can not be easily explained by dynamical mechanisms , because the stellar densities in elliptical galaxies are so much lower than those in globular clusters ( except for the very center of ellipticals , which often harbor a black hole ) .",
    "the central luminosity densities of ngc6388 and ngc6441 are respectively @xmath123  @xmath85 pc@xmath124 and @xmath125  @xmath85 pc@xmath124 ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "m32 has a luminosity density of @xmath126  @xmath85 pc@xmath124 at a radius of @xmath127 , but this density drops rapidly by more than three orders of magnitude at radii greater than 8@xmath24 ( tonry 1988 ; gebhardt et al .  1996 ; private communication gebhardt 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , the far - uv to @xmath128-band flux ratio increases with radius in m32 ( ohl et al .",
    "1998 ) . because our stis data firmly demonstrate that the weak far - uv flux is due to hot hb stars , the increase in the far - uv to @xmath128-band flux ratio indicates that hot hb stars comprise a larger fraction of the population at increasing distance from the galactic center  again , opposite to the behavior expected from a dynamical creation mechanism such as tidal interaction or binarism .      in recent years",
    ", much of the effort on dating m32 has shown a need for an intermediate - age ( @xmath129 gyr ) component to its population . when this fact is considered in tandem with its small size and proximity to m31 ,",
    "its utility as a template for other ellipticals is somewhat diminished .",
    "however , even though it may be unusual , m32 represents the only elliptical near enough for intense study by all of the standard stellar population analysis methods ( spectroscopy , line indices , color - magnitude diagrams , etc . ) , at least until we have a successor to hst with uv - optical capability . with this in mind , are we certain that m32 has a younger component to its older , dominant population ? we feel that this remains an open question .",
    "early color - magnitude diagrams reported evidence for a younger population by finding very bright agb stars , but later interpretations of these data showed that both crowding ( renzini 1998 ) and long - period variables ( guarnieri et al .",
    "1997 ) confused the earlier analysis ; later observations ( grillmair et al.1996 ) also find no evidence for optically bright agb stars , but these stars were difficult to detect in the @xmath130 band .",
    "instead , it appears that the brightest agb stars in m32 are consistent with those found in other old globular clusters ( guarnieri et al.1997 ; renzini 1998 ) .",
    "we note that our own data show a lack of the very bright post - agb stars that should be present if they are leaving the tip of the agb at luminosities much brighter than the rgb tip .",
    "spectral synthesis analyses using isochrones like those of worthey ( 1994 ) assume a pure red clump hb morphology , and the stis data show that this assumption is not entirely accurate ; note , however , that the worthey models were not intended to address uv flux . depending upon",
    "how much of the population extends beyond the red clump , an analysis that assumes a pure red clump may be seriously incorrect .",
    "our data demonstrate that the hot horizontal branch is populated in m32 , but the lack of color information prevents us from constraining the hb morphology further .",
    "the tracks that reproduce the stis luminosity function come from a wide range of t@xmath19 on the hb ( see table 8) , and so they are consistent with both a bimodal hb distribution and with an extended , more uniform distribution",
    ". however , the integrated spectrum of m32 does not show the strong 2500   dip seen in uv - bright quiescent giant ellipticals ( compare figure 4  with the spectra of burstein et al.1988 and brown et al .",
    "1997 ) . given the presence of hot hb stars and the missing 2500   dip , the distribution of effective temperature on the hb might be more uniform in m32 than the strongly bimodal distributions assumed in giant ellipticals .",
    "the zero - age hb becomes more bimodal at increasing metallicity and helium abundance ( see dorman et al.1993 ) ; because m32 has an abundance much closer to solar than the giant ellipticals ( see burstein et al.1988 ) , evolution theory favors a more uniform hb . our hot hb model population ( table  8)",
    ", if correct , would be responsible for practically all of the flux at 2500   , and contribute to approximately 10% of the flux from 30004000   , even though it only comprises a small fraction of the hb population ( @xmath75% ) .",
    "thus , this hot hb component should not be ignored for population fitting in the mid - uv .",
    "the h@xmath131 ( @xmath132 4861   ) line index is often quoted as another piece of evidence in favor of a young component in m32 . it is significantly stronger in m32 than in the higher metallicity giant ellipticals ( bressan , chiosi , & tantalo 1996 ; burstein et al .  1984 ) , with an equivalent width ( ew ) of 2.2    compared to an average value of 1.7   .",
    "metal - poor globular clusters have even stronger h@xmath131 absorption than m32 ( as high as 3    ew ) , but the index decreases in strength at increasing metallicity , and high metallicity globular clusters show a weaker index than in m32 ( burstein et al .  1984 ) .",
    "note , however , that these earlier studies did not include metal - rich gcs with blue hb morphology , such as those studied by rich et al.(1997 ) .",
    "burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) claim that the addition of early a stars to the old stellar population in m32 can increase the h@xmath131 appropriately , but the resulting uv continuum would be too bright , and instead favor later main - sequence f stars .",
    "note that there is a radial gradient to the h@xmath131 absorption in m32 , in the sense that it is significantly weaker in the deepest parts of the stis image , compared to the galactic center ( gonz@xmath133lez 1993 ; hardy et al.1994 ) ; this suggests that the younger population , if present , is most prevalant in the nucleus ( see grillmair et al.1996 ) .",
    "it is possible instead that intermediate - temperature hb stars could account for _ some _ of the extra h@xmath131 absorption ( assuming that m32 has a less bimodal hb mass distribution than seen in giant ellipticals ) , but it is unlikely , given our data and models , that the hb could account for _ all _ of this extra absorption .",
    "approximately 20% of the light at h@xmath131 comes from the horizontal branch ( see , e.g. , yi , demarque , & oemler 1997 ) .",
    "thus , if a large fraction of the zahb population was at f - star temperatures ( near 7000  k ) , the h@xmath131 absorption would increase significantly . specifically , a small set of synthetic spectra calculated for this purpose , using synspec ( hubeny , lanz , & jeffery 1994 ) and kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres , shows that the h@xmath131 ew increases from 1.2    at t@xmath19 = 5000  k to 8    at 7500  k ( measuring ew as in faber et al.1985 ) , eventually peaking to 9.5    at 9000  k. zahb stars near 7000  k would lie at the very faint ( and incomplete ) end of the stis luminosity function ( see figure 7 ) , and thus could be present in large numbers .",
    "however , these stars become post - early agb stars in their later and brighter phases , and if such tracks are populated at significant levels ( @xmath7 50% ) , the stis luminosity function would have many more uv - bright stars than we actually see . note that the hot - hb model population shown in table  8 comprising @xmath7 5% of the hb population , would only contribute to @xmath7 5% of the flux at h@xmath131 .",
    "one could place a large fraction of the zahb near 7000  k ( thus accounting for all of the h@xmath131 absorption ) only if the later , uv - bright post - early - agb phases were more rapid than predicted from the models , as seen for the post - agb stars .",
    "thus , even with a hot hb component in m32 , the h@xmath131 absorption might be the one piece of evidence that is difficult to explain without some trace of younger stars or blue stragglers .",
    "the stis data presented here are the first to directly image stars on the hot horizontal branch in any elliptical galaxy . in previous work ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution and the magnitude of the far - uv flux in giant ellipticals required the presence of hot hb stars , unless uv - bright post - agb stars were much more efficient uv emitters than thought previously . until these stis observations , m32 was the one example of an elliptical where the weak uv flux could have been explained by canonical low - mass post - agb tracks .",
    "our data show that the hot hb is populated in m32 , and that the uv - bright phases of post - agb evolution are less populated than expected from canonical tracks ; thus these data represent a direct confirmation that the uv upturn in ellipticals originates in hot hb stars .",
    "our findings demonstrate that m32 does not have a pure `` red clump '' hb morphology , as assumed by many of the stellar population analyses of this galaxy .",
    "if the hb effective temperature distribution is not extremely bimodal , our findings may weaken the evidence for an intermediate age population in m32 .",
    "color information would best constrain the hb morphology further , and we will propose to carry out far - uv imaging of this same field in the coming hst cycle ; the far - uv data would provide an excellent discriminator between stars hotter and cooler than 12000  k , which would constrain the bimodality of the hb in m32 .",
    "furthermore , color information will allow us to discern how many of the faint stars in our luminosity function are on the white dwarf cooling curve , and this may shed light on the evolution of post - agb stars , which appear to be evolving rapidly in the stis field .",
