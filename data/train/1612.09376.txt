    "recently , the interest in topological state of matter is reignited since theoretical prediction and experimental realization of quantum spin hall effect and @xmath4 topological insulator.@xcite for most of real - life topological materials , e.g. time - reversal invariant @xmath2 topological insulator in hgte / cdte quantum wells , bi and sb - series compounds,@xcite their basic properties can be readily understood in the framework of single - particle picture , e.g. topological band theory.@xcite    however , electron correlation effect in strong interacting topological materials is still poorly understood , particularly for the well - known topological kondo insulator candidate - samarium hexaboride ( smb@xmath3),@xcite although topological view of point provides appealing explanation to its mysterious low - temperature surface state,@xcite the light electron detected in such surface state hinders a satisfactory solution.@xcite furthermore , recent high - field quantum oscillation measurement even arises a possibility of hidden three - dimensional fermi surface in such bulk insulator.@xcite    to answer these serious problems , insightful ideas like surface kondo breakdown , fractionalized fermi liquid and majorana fermi sea are proposed in light of the wisdom that strong electron correlation may lead to radical reconstruction of low - energy physics and fractionalization of electron is a fascinating option.@xcite    unfortunately , in dimension larger than one , these interesting ideas are hard to be verified unbiasedly in terms of current analytical and numerical calculation tools , thus present studies are mainly focused on a simplified one - dimensional topological kondo insulator model , i.e. @xmath0 @xmath1-wave kondo lattice model invented by alexandrov and coleman , @xcite and further inspected by abelian bosonization and density matrix renormalization grounp ( dmrg ) techniques.@xcite the core finding in these works is that if quantum fluctuation effect is included , the paramagnetic end modes ( usual fermion zero - energy mode ) predicted in large - n mean - field theory is unstable toward a magnetic end state , which is a novel realization of the famous haldane phase for spin - one antiferromagnetic chain.@xcite    nevertheless , we recall that both the concept of topological kondo insulator itself and its realistic material modeling are actually starting from periodic anderson - like model , which includes essential charge / velaence fluctuation effect of @xmath5-electron beyond the spin - only kondo lattice - like model.@xcite for example , x - ray core - level spectroscopy measurement suggests the @xmath5 level occupation of smb@xmath3 is approximated as @xmath6,@xcite much smaller than unit as modeled in @xmath1-wave kondo lattice model , thus it is not known whether the results found in such kondo lattice - like model is applicable to realistic mixed - valence compound like smb@xmath3 .",

    "the charge degree of freedom of @xmath5-electron is preserved and not only kondo limit but also mixed - valence regime can be reliably explored by existing theoretical approaches . as a first step to this interesting issue , we consider a half - filled system with particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath12 ) , thus the state of art projector quantum monte carlo ( pqmc ) can be readily utilized without notorious fermion minus - sign problem.@xcite from our numerical simulation of pqmc , it is found that the system is indeed located in the haldane - like state as detected in previous works on @xmath1-wave kondo lattice model , though the soluble non - interacting limit correspond to conventional @xmath2 topological insulating state .",

    "[ fig : phase ] ) therefore , our calculation indicates that finding in kondo lattice - like models may still be relevant to realistic materials with sensible charge fluctuation at least for nearly half - filled systems .",
    "more interestingly , the edge magnetization in the haldane - like phase is generally deviated from unit magnetic moment as in a pure ( spin - one ) haldane phase .",
    "this is due to intrinsic charge fluctuation introduced in our periodic anderson - like model and is beyond the description of kondo lattice - like model in previous works .",
    "additionally , we have not observe any noticeable signature of surface kondo breakdown and other elements like frustration interaction should be added to induce those radical destruction of kondo screening .",

    "( one finds @xmath20 and @xmath21 with our notation for @xmath16 . )",
    "firstly , we discuss an exactly soluble limit , where the hubbard interaction is turned off ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 here , the model has been transformed into momentum space via fourier transformation and a four - component spinor @xmath24 has been introduced as @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 are the usual @xmath27 pauli matrix acting on orbital basis and @xmath28 is the @xmath27 unit matrix . the dispersion of conduction and f - electron are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1-wave hybridization is denoted by @xmath31 with form factor @xmath32 .    for this non - interacting model ,",
    "its quasi - particle energy spectrum is easily found to be @xmath33 which has two - fold spin degeneracy . when the system is half - filled , the lower band @xmath34 is fully occupied and a gap exists for all quasi - particle excitations , thus we are truly considering a bulk insulator .",
    "follow ref . , the system @xmath35 is invariant under both time - reversal @xmath36 and space - inversion @xmath37 transformation since @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 so , the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath35 has time - reversal and inversion symmetry and according to the fu - kane formula,@xcite the system can be a @xmath2 topological insulator if the following @xmath2 index @xmath41 : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 are the parity at the high - symmetry points of @xmath0 brillouin zone .",

    "the expected edge states are actually formed by these fermion zero mode like @xmath67 .",
    "thus , one is able obtain four - fold degenerated many - body ground - state wave - function for this non - interacting case .    more generally , when @xmath68 , these edge modes are still stable if no bulk gap is closed during evolution of hamiltonian .",
    "( e.g. see fig.[fig : tki_0 ] )     fermion zero mode ( edge state ) per spin - flavor in non - interacting @xmath0 p - wave periodic anderson model .",
    "parameters are set to be @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . ]    in addition , we have checked that for all cases with @xmath19 and @xmath72 , the system shows fermion zero modes , which means the system itself is always in a topological state .",
    "obviously , this finding is consistent with the results of topological band theory ( calculation of @xmath2 index @xmath41 ) in last subsection .",
    "from the analysis in last section , we know that the non - interacting system is located in a @xmath2 topological insulating phase with fermion edge mode .",
    "when we turn on interaction @xmath9 , complicated situation may occur .",
    "for example , if adiabatic continuity works , we expect the @xmath73 topological phase is still unchanged for not too large @xmath9 . in contrast , particularly for @xmath0 system , the effect of interaction is radical and even a small @xmath9 can lead the system into a new phase different from the non - interacting limit .    here , we will use pqmc to simulate the @xmath0 @xmath1-wave periodic anderson model . basically , in pqmc , one is able to calculate ground - state expectation value of observable @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the ground - state many - body wave - function of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , obtained from a imaginary - time projection of trial wave - function @xmath77 .",
    "this trial wave - function can be simply chosen as the ground - state of the non - interacting hamiltonian , e.g. @xmath35 ( eq .  [ eq3 ] ) , or hartree - fock mean - field solution of the whole hamiltonian . moreover ,",
    "the requirement @xmath78 should be fulfilled , otherwise the above projection method will not converge into the desirable interacting many - body ground - state . in realistic numerical calculation ,",
    "the imaginary - time length @xmath79 is obviously finite but a large value of it is able to obtain a converge result .",
    "( e.g. @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the size of the system )    motivated by the previous study of @xmath0 @xmath1-wave kondo lattice , we will study this model by fixing hopping energy @xmath82 such that a finite @xmath9 case may lead to visible haldane state with insulating bulk and free local moments located on boundary . to find such phase , magnetization on each site and string order parameter",
    "can be used but for pqmc , the calculation of exponential of operators in string order is very challenging , thus we may calculate site - resolved magnetization to detect the possible edge local moment .      before discussing the interacting problem , we first show the results in non - interacting limit ( @xmath22 ) with open boundary condition . from fig .",
    "[ fig:1dpam_u=0 ] , we see that the f - electron density @xmath83 is uniform and the site - resolved magnetization @xmath84 is zero for all sites .",
    "the double occupation number of f - electron @xmath85 is at its non - interacting limit , which is @xmath86 for single occupation on each site .",
    "the @xmath87 hybridization @xmath88 is found to be weakened at boundary , where fewer conduction electron nearby reduces the hybridization .",
    "moreover , the spin correlations @xmath89 and @xmath90 are all short - ranged .",
    "( the typical correlation length in this case is about one or two sites . )",
    "so , the system should be in a spin - disordered state while the @xmath91 case has much longer correlation length ( @xmath92 to @xmath93 sites ) is a metallic state .",
    "the charge correlation ( not shown here ) is similar .",
    "when we consider the bulk system ( with periodic boundary condition ) , the spin , charge and single - particle gap above the half - filled ground - state can be estimated as @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the ground - state energy with @xmath96 spin - up electron and @xmath97 spin - down electron . for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , it is found @xmath100 , consistent with direct calculation using eq .",
    "so , the bulk is an insulator with both finite charge and spin gap .",
    "now , return to the open boundary system , we obtain @xmath101 , which means zero - energy ( fermion edge ) mode must exist and it agrees with the finding in last section .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the @xmath22 system is in a bulk insulating state with both charge and spin gap and its edge has fermion zero - energy mode .",
    "an important indication from here is that there is no free spin-@xmath102 local moment at edge and we conclude that the @xmath22 state is obviously not the haldane phase but the @xmath2 topological insulator discussed previously",

    "we have also tested more longer chain as @xmath115 and it does not lead to any sensible changes compared to @xmath116 chain . additionally , statistical errors in our pqmc simulation are typically smaller than the symbol size in the plot and will not be explicitly shown in figures .    from fig.[fig:1dpam_u=2 ] , we see that the double occupation number is suppressed around boundary , which is an effect of interaction since the non - interacting case shows uniform distribution .",
    "such reduced double occupation possibility actually leads to an enhanced local moment in edge site .",
    "the effective @xmath87 hybridization is reduced around edge like the non - interacting case . from these two results",
    ", we may think local moment at boundary in the interacting situation is more free than its non - interacting counterpart .",
    "the most interesting result can be draw from the site - resolved magnetization @xmath106 , where the large magnetization ( nearly unit ) is observed at two edges.@xcite this may be seen as a free @xmath102-local moment / spin localized at boundary while the inner sites only have small magnetization , which reflects the nature of bounded spin - singlet .",
    "so , this indicates there exists so - called magnetic end state proposed in large - n mean - field calculation and found in bosonization and dmrg.@xcite however , this end state is not corresponding to the non - interacting limit since the latter has no magnetization around edge . for comparison , the site - resolved magnetization of local electron @xmath110 is also shown and it implies that the total magnetization at boundary is most contributed from local @xmath5-electron and the remaining conduction electron has smaller contribution .",
    "in addition , the short - ranged spin - spin correlation for conduction and f - electron shows ferromagnetic correlation for on - site spins , while the nearest ones are anti - ferromagnetic .",
    "the same case is found for spin correlation between f - electrons . such that , if we approximate the system as two coupled spin-@xmath102 chains , the effective coupling between chains is ferromagnetic .",
    "therefore , in the low - energy limit , a haldane - like phase should form and the corresponding edge state has free spin-@xmath102 magnetic moment , which agrees with the observation in magnetization .",
    "now , we conclude that the interacting model shows the expected haldane - like phase with free ( spin-@xmath102 ) magnetic moment situated at boundary , consistent with dmrg and bosonization,@xcite but in contrast to the non - interacting case .",
    "so , we have seen that the adiabatic continuity breaks down in this model when interaction is added and the interaction effect is fundamental in @xmath0 , where sophisticated techniques beyond mean - field theories should be used .",
    "recently , the strange correlator is proposed to detect short - range entangled topological states and it has successfully identified many topological states of matter including the haldane phase in spin - one heisenberg antiferromagnets , @xmath0 and @xmath117 aklt state , quantum spin hall state and bosonic symmetry - protected topological state.@xcite the virtue of strange correlator is that no bipartition of system is involved and finite - size effect from open boundary calculation is heavily reduced .    for our cases , we use pqmc to sample the target ground - state wave - function from the imaginary evolution of a trial wave - function @xmath118 while a trivial state @xmath119 is chosen to be a state with @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the following strangle correlator is able to be calculated     strange correlator @xmath121 in @xmath0 p - wave periodic anderson model , @xmath22 versus @xmath109 case .",

    "@xmath123    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pqmc_strange ] , we see that both the non - interacting case ( @xmath22 ) and interacting case ( @xmath109 ) show divergent - like behavior in their strange correlators , which means they are all non - trivial topological states , although the divergence is cut off by finite - size effect .",
    "interestingly , the interacting system has stronger divergence than the non - interacting one , which may indicate that the haldane - like phase may be more entangled than its non - interacting counterpart , the @xmath2 topological insulating state .",
    "the results here supplement the observation in site - resolved magnetization and agree with each other .",
    "in last section , we have seen that a haldane - like phase is found in our @xmath0 @xmath1-wave periodic anderson model , whose essential feature is the existence of free magnetic moment at boundary of an open chain system and is detected by non - vanished magnetization of both conduction and local electron .    in this section ,",

    "( when @xmath22 , magnetization is vanished as seen in fig .  [ fig:1dpam_u=0 ] .",
    ") it is noted that the case with @xmath124 has inverted magnetization in comparison to other cases and the reason is that in all numerical simulations performed in this work , we consider a total spin - singlet system but since edge magnetization is able to build at two equivalent direction ( e.g. spin - up and spin down direction ) , it inevitably leads to two degenerated ground - states .",
    "however , for pqmc , it only randomly selects one of ground - states and this explains the observed distinction .",
    "next , turning different value of hybridization strength @xmath16 leads to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pqmc_v_change ] . here",
    ", we have observed that larger @xmath16 results to smaller edge magnetization , which is due to enhanced kondo screening and charge fluctuation for larger @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath16 is as small as @xmath125 for fixed other parameters , magnetization at boundary actually exceeds unit , which may be ascribed to intrinsic charge fluctuation captured in our periodic anderson - like model .    after all , these results show that with generic parameters chosen for our model , the edge magnetization is deviated from unit as in pure spin - one antiferromagnetic chain , where decoupled ( fractionalized ) spin - half objects appear at boundary . in our present model ,",
    "since charge fluctuation always exists , for simplicity , we may imagine that a spin-@xmath102 object at boundary will fluctuate into a spin - one composite or a zero - spin one , thus the effective magnetic moment at edge is not unit but changed by its surrounding electron configuration .",
    "it is noted that similar results have been found in doped three - legged hubbard ladder , where the insulating phase is always the haldane phase regardless of the suppression from unity of spin.@xcite",
    "here , we provide a qualitative argument on why magnetic end states appear in interacting system .",
    "firstly , we know that when @xmath126 ( kitaev point ) , the non - interacting ground - state under open boundary condition can be approximated as a superposition of four zero - modes @xmath127 . for non - interacting case ,",
    "the contribution of these four degenerated states are equal and the magnetization is obviously zero and no magnetic end state exists .",
    "however , when hubbard-@xmath9 interaction is turned on , the double - occupation is suppressed , thus states like @xmath128 and @xmath129 have small contribution to the system and the remaining ones are @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "clearly , these two survivals are degenerated , but for numerical simulation like pqmc performed in this work , one is only able to obtain one of these two states at a time . in other words , in one simulation , we may obtain @xmath130 as our ground - state while in other simulation , @xmath131 may be observed .",
    "( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : pqmc_u_change ] ) therefore , for each of state , we can observe the magnetic end mode .",
    "more generally , since the topological feature is not changed under ( smooth ) continuous mapping of hamiltonian , we expect the argument at special point @xmath126 is still valid at least qualitatively for generic conditions . in some sense ,",
    "the interaction in our @xmath1-wave periodic anderson model reduces the four - fold degeneracy of non - interacting ground - state into double degeneracy for interacting ground - state , which is similar to the findings in su - schrieffer - heeger - hubbard model and symmetry - protected one - dimensional fermionic superconducting phases.@xcite      in refs .",

    "[ eq1 ] in terms of unbiased pqmc simulation .",
    "the ground - state is the expected haldane - like phase with magnetic end mode driven by electron correlation effect beyond effective non - interacting single - particle picture .",
    "in addition , we have not found any clue of surface kondo breakdown proposed in literature and frustration - like interaction , e.g. ring - exchange interaction among nearest sites , should be crucial to induce such radical destruction of kondo screening .",
    "alternatively , one may investigate the finite temperature effect on the stability of haldane - like phase .",
    "physically , the topological state will be still protected by the bulk gap unless the thermal fluctuation overwhelms such gap . at the same time",
    ", the elevated temperature has the potential to destroy kondo screening and it is expected that we can detect the breakdown of the surface kondo effect with the help of finite - temperature determinant quantum monte carlo algorithm widely used in simulation of correlated electron problems.@xcite future work in this direction will be helpful to clarify the possibility of temperature - driven surface kondo breakdown mechanism .",
