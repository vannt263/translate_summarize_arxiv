    "low - scale string models are phenomenological models in string theory , whose fundamental scale , the string scale @xmath0 , is of the order of tev @xcite .",
    "since such a low string scale is possible due to the existence of large extra dimensions , these models are expected to solve the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) and have a possibility of being confirmed or excluded by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "signatures of low - scale string models at the lhc are different from other typical signatures of field theoretical models with extra dimensions , such as the add model @xcite and the rs model @xcite .",

    "in low - scale string models , two - body scattering amplitudes between sm particles are calculated as open - string amplitudes with four external legs of lowest vibrational modes of open string .",
    "the open - string amplitudes reduce to the sm amplitudes in the low - energy limit where a scattering energy @xmath34 is much less than the string scale @xmath0 , @xmath35 .",
    "the amplitudes begin to represent string effects at @xmath36 , through `` string form factor '' functions such as @xmath37 where @xmath28 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mandelstam variables of the scattering sm particles .",
    "the form factor function is expanded by a sum over infinite @xmath28-channel poles , @xmath40 which is a good approximation near each @xmath18th pole , @xmath41 .",
    "these poles correspond to string excited states which have masses of @xmath16 .",
    "this shows that the four - point open - string amplitudes reduce to the two - body scattering amplitudes between sm particles , in which string excited states are exchanged in @xmath28-channel .",
    "angular dependences in the open - string amplitudes are described by a factor @xmath42 in eq.([eq : v - function_expansion ] ) multiplied by angular dependences in the original sm amplitudes .",
    "the open - string amplitudes are decomposed into a sum over the wigner @xmath43-functions , @xmath44.-function @xmath44 represents an angular dependence of a process through a state with spin @xmath45 , in which an initial state has total spin along @xmath46-axis , @xmath47 , and a final state has total spin along @xmath48-axis , @xmath49 .",
    "the angle @xmath50 is that between the @xmath46-axis and @xmath48-axis . ]",
    "this shows that @xmath18th string excited states corresponding to the @xmath18th pole in eq.([eq : v - function_expansion ] ) are degenerate in mass of @xmath51 with various spins of @xmath45 which are smaller than a highest spin @xmath52 .",
    "the value of the highest spin is @xmath17 , where @xmath19 is the spin of the original sm particle .",
    "string excited states decay into sm particles , and the @xmath28-channel poles in eq.([eq : v - function_expansion ] ) are modified to the breit - wigner form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a total decay width of the @xmath18th string excited state with spin @xmath45 .",
    "the width is calculated by extracting couplings among the string excited state and sm particles from coefficients of each wigner @xmath43-function @xmath44 in the corresponding open - string amplitudes @xcite .",

    "the masses of second string excited states , @xmath33 , are larger than that of first string excited states , @xmath0 , and decay processes of @xmath83 and @xmath84 should also be considered . however , there are some technical complication to calculate string amplitudes with external legs of first string excited states .",
    "we discuss this issue in sec.[sec : second_resonance ] .",
