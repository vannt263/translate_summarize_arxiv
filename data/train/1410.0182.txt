    " when i first met gabriele  here `` i '' is et  it was 1975 , when he turned up in my office at the university of rome , introduced by my senior colleague and former mentor franco bassani .",
    "gabriele was then a young undergraduate student of pisa s scuola normale ( where i also came from ) and was seeking outside advisors for a thesis subject in modern condensed matter theory .",
    "my rome colleague mario tosi , who was a professor , accepted to serve as his formal external advisor , and so gabriele started coming back periodically to rome , working on the general subject of the electron gas  `` _ electron gas _ '' even became gabriele s nickname , as far as i was concerned .",
    "the age gap between gabriele and me was slightly less than ten years ; we became friends and spent time together , talking physics , politics , and everything else on our minds .",
    "i had recently come back from cambridge where i had worked with phil anderson on a possible surface version of charge - density - waves ( cdws ) instabilities of the electron gas invented a decade earlier by al overhauser in the us .",
    "i was enthusiastic about the subject , and ended up getting gabriele interested too , and so it was that cdws and overhauser made their first entry in gabriele s life .",
    "gabriele giuliani ( center ) with mario tosi ( left ) and franco bassani ( right ) on the appennines during a trip from rome to gabriele s hometown , ascoli piceno ( autumn 1976 ) .",
    "photograph taken by erio tosatti.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in 1977 when , after completion of his degree in pisa , i asked gabriele to consider my newly founded group in trieste , to which i had managed to attract colleagues of the caliber of young michele parrinello and of mature mario tosi .",
    "he liked it , and decided to join . in trieste",
    ", we began working on one - dimensional cdws and similar systems @xcite .",
    "he worked hard and got far ahead of my rudimentary command of many body theory and related suggestions .",
    "i recall for example one calculation where he was supposed to reproduce , with some supposedly clever approximation i had cooked up , one exactly known result .",
    "i abused him abundantly because he was consistently failing to get the exact result by a factor 2  only to discover the hard way that he was right and the culprit was my beloved approximation . in spite of all that , when one summer i met al overhauser in the us , he approached me quite enthusiastically about our otherwise universally ignored cdw paper @xcite , and declared that he would be delighted to welcome gabriele to visit his group , possibly for a phd curriculum ( a title that did not exist in italy at the time ) . and this is how gabriele ended up at purdue , in 1979 , first as a postdoc with al overhauser , and then , after a further postdoc at brown university , with a tenure .",
    "our more than brotherly relationship continued uninterrupted to his very last few days , with visits , contacts , and many many phone and skype calls which he would never forget to make in connection with all kinds of occasions or even without . besides gabriele s friendship",
    ", his other main present has been his former student giuseppe santoro , who came to trieste at his suggestion to become a close friend and collaborator to this day",
    ".    _ giuseppe santoro _",
    " it was 1987  a few years after he returned to purdue from brown  that i joined gabriele at purdue , the `` i '' now being ges .",
    "i had met him already in a couple of occasions in pisa , were i was a student of the scuola normale superiore that gabriele regularly visited during his trips to italy , to visit his family in the beloved hometown of ascoli piceno ( _ al ascoli _ was , as i soon discovered , gabriele s first screen upon log - in on any computer on earth ) . by that time  we were in the quantum hall effect era  the focus of gabriele research was the two - dimensional electron gas , and this was the initial interest of my first papers at purdue .",
    "but i still can not recall a single office day , during my stay at purdue from 1987 to 1991 , in which gabriele was not paying a visit to al overhauser : and in overhauser s office , a most sure topic of discussion was charge ( and spin ) density waves .",
    "it is fair to say that , since the early days , gabriele and cdw ( first ) and two - dimensional electronic systems ( later ) remained entangled together .",
    "it is thus fitting that this article , devoted to him and his legacy , should be on the cdws of a peculiar two - dimensional layered system , nbse@xmath1 , on which we have recently come across .",
    "charge - density - waves ( cdws ) are static modulations of small amplitude and generally incommensurate periodicities which occur in the electron density distribution and in the lattice positions of a variety of materials  @xcite .",
    "they may derive either by an exchange - driven instability of a metallic fermi surface  @xcite , or by a lattice dynamical instability leading to a static periodic lattice distortion ( pld ) which may equivalently be driven by electrons near fermi  @xcite or finally just by anharmonicity  @xcite .",
    "a cdw superstructure , characterized by amplitude @xmath2 and phase @xmath3 relative to the underlying crystal lattice can be made to slide with transport of mass and charge and with energy dissipation under external perturbations and fields  @xcite .",
    "phase slips in bulk cdws / plds are involved in a variety of phenomena , including noise generation  @xcite , switching  @xcite , current conversion at contacts  @xcite , noise  @xcite and more . while these phenomena are now classic knowledge , there is to date no parallel work addressing the possibility to mechanically provoke cdw phase slips at a chosen local point , see pictorial illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] . in this work",
    "we describe a two - dimensional model showing how a localized cdw / pld phase slip may be provoked by external action of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) tip at an arbitrarily chosen point outside a surface .",
    "pictorial view of an afm tip provoking phase slips over a surface cdw modulation.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the study of the microscopic mechanisms leading to energy dissipation and friction has very important theoretical and practical implications . in recent years",
    ", experiments have started to single out the effects of microscopic probes in contact or near contact with different surfaces , and much theoretical effort has been devoted to the understanding of such experiments  @xcite . in particular , the minimally invasive non - contact experiments offer a chance to investigate delicate surface properties and promise to bring new insight on localized effects and their interaction with the bulk .",
    "the development of ultra - sensitive tools such as the `` pendulum '' afm  @xcite offers a chance to investigate more delicate and intimate substrate properties . near a cdw material",
    "the tip oscillations may actuate , through van der waals or electrostatic coupling , an electronic and atomic movement in the surface right under the tip , amounting in this case to coupling to the cdw order parameter . owing to the periodic nature of the cdw state ,",
    "the coupled tip - cdw system has multiple solutions , characterized by a different winding number ( a topological property ) which differ by a local phase slip , and correspond to different energy branches . at the precise tip - surface distance where two branches cross ,",
    "the system will jump from one to the other injecting a local 2@xmath0 phase slip , and the corresponding hysteresis cycle will reflect directly as a mechanical dissipation , persisting even at low tip oscillation frequencies .",
    "recently , a non - contact atomic force microscopy ( afm ) experiment  @xcite on a nbse@xmath1 sample has shown dissipation peaks appearing at specific heights from the surface and extending up to @xmath4 nm far from it .",
    "these peaks were obtained with tips oscillating both parallel and perpendicular to the surface , and in a range of temperatures compatible with the surface charge density wave ( cdw ) phase of the sample . in this paper , a model is proposed explaining in detail the mechanism responsible for these peaks : the tip oscillations induce a charge perturbation in the surface right under the tip , but , due to the nature of the cdw order parameter , multiple stable charge configurations exist characterized by different `` topological '' properties .",
    "when the tip oscillates at distances corresponding to the crossover of this different manifolds , the system is not allowed to follow the energy minimum configuration , even at the low experimental frequencies of oscillation , and this gives rise to a hysteresis loop for the tip , leading to an increase in the dissipation .",
    "in the following , we will use the term cdw to indicate a periodic modulation of the charge density @xmath5 , irrespective of the process behind its generation .",
    "this modulation is described , in the unperturbed system and for the simplest form of cdw , as @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the intensity , @xmath7 the characteristic wavelength , and @xmath8 an initially constant phase , fixed by some far away agent .",
    "perturbations to cdws have been studied extensively  @xcite , but most studies are concerned either with uniform perturbations ( e.g. , the dynamics of a cdw under an external electric field ) or point - like perturbations ( e.g. , the static pinning of the cdw by defects ) , and often consider one - dimensional models , appropriate for quasi - one - dimensional materials , where the coherence length in the perpendicular directions is smaller than the atomic distance . here",
    "we wish to study , instead , the effect of a localized perturbation represented by a weakly interacting and slowly oscillating nano or mesoscopic sized probe hovering above the surface , acting on a length scale @xmath9 similar to the cdw wavelength , @xmath10 , and on a material where the coherence length is macroscopic in more than one dimension .    starting from the standard fukuyama - lee - rice model  @xcite for cdw , the charge modulation is described as a classical elastic medium , through a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory . a complex space - dependent ( and later , time - dependent )",
    "order parameter @xmath11 will take into account both the amplitude degree of freedom @xmath12 , as well as the phase @xmath3 , in terms of which the charge density modulation is expressed as @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the unperturbed system has @xmath14 and @xmath15 , both constant .",

    "if we now consider the effect of an external perturbation  in our case , the afm tip , generically described as a potential @xmath19 coupling to the charge density modulation @xmath20  , we will need to add to the gl free - energy functional an extra term of the form : @xmath21 = \\int \\ !",

    ", we should consider the case where @xmath19 has a given specific shape with a finite width @xmath9 of the order of the wavelength @xmath23 , and minimize the total gl free energy @xmath26 , including the amplitude degree of freedom @xmath24 .",
    "the fact that a phase - only functional @xmath27 is inadequate in describing this specific effect can be argued as follows . if we consider a purely one - dimensional model @xmath28 $ ] , we would end - up with a linear behavior of @xmath29  the solution of the laplace equation in one - dimension  in the regions where the potential is zero . since we expect a decay of @xmath3 towards some constant @xmath8 far from the perturbation ,",
    "this is a clearly unphysical result . but",
    "moving to a two - dimensional phase - only functional does not improve the situation very much .",
    "indeed , due to the nature of the phase , which is defined modulo @xmath30 , given some boundary conditions the solution is not univocally defined unless the total variation of @xmath3 along the sample is also specified . assuming the phase to have the unperturbed value @xmath8 far from the perturbation",
    ", we can define the integer _ winding number _",
    "@xmath31 of a solution as the integral @xmath32 taken along the cdw direction @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 typically representing the unperturbed case ) .",
    "since any change in the winding number along the @xmath33 direction would extend to the whole sample , and unnaturally raise the energy of such a solution , to recover a physical result we definitely need to take into account the amplitude degree of freedom , which will allow for the presence of dislocations and local changes in the winding number .",
    "for these reasons , we consider the full gl problem @xmath26 in two dimensions , with the complete complex order parameter @xmath11 , and in a subspace with a definite winding number . the final result is expected to be similar to what previously considered in the wider context of phase slips  @xcite and more specifically in the case of localized phase slip centers  @xcite .",
    "namely , the local strain induced by the perturbation on the phase will reduce the order parameter amplitude , to the point where a local phase slip event becomes possible . in more than one dimension , the boundary between areas with different winding number will be marked by _",
    "vortices _ of the phase .    from this preliminary analysis , the mechanism responsible for the dissipation peaks can be understood : as the tip approaches the surface , it encounters points where the energies of solutions with different winding number undergo a crossover . at these points",
    "the transition between manifolds is not straightforward , due to the mechanism required to create the vortices ; therefore the tip oscillations lead to jumps between different manifolds , resulting in hysteresis for the tip , and ultimately dissipation .",
    "to asses the validity of the proposed mechanism , we have performed numerical simulations of the tip - surface interaction with a full gl free - energy @xmath35 = { \\mathcal{f}}_0+{\\mathcal{f}}_v$ ] . for simplicity , a two - dimensional gl functional is considered , since this takes into account the relevant elastic effects while keeping the simulation simple enough : indeed , the experimental substrate nbse@xmath1",
    "@xcite has a quasi - two - dimensional structure , so that volume effects are expected to be not crucial . differently from the experimental system",
    "@xcite , we will model the cdw as being characterized by a single wavevector @xmath33 , leading to a simpler order parameter and a clearer effect . to represent the effect of the tip , the shape of a van der waals potential",
    "@xmath36 is integrated over a conical tip at distance @xmath37 from the surface .",
    "we have found that the result of such a calculation can be reasonably approximated in the main area under the tip by a lorentzian curve : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance in the plane from the point right below the tip and the parameters are found to scale like @xmath40 and @xmath41 . knowing the shape of the perturbation , the total free energy @xmath26 is minimized numerically on a square grid of points with spacing much smaller than the characteristic wavelength of the cdw , imposing a constant boundary condition @xmath42 on the sides perpendicular to @xmath33 , while setting periodic boundary conditions in the other direction to allow for possible phase jumps .",
