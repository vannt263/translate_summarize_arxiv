    "universal scaling of elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) has been recently observed at rhic @xcite .",
    "that is , for a broad range of particle species , @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 scales to a single function ; here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the number of valence quarks ( @xmath6 for mesons and baryons respectively ) and the transverse kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "this observation has been interpreted as evidence that transverse expansion of the matter produced in energetic rhic collisions , occurs during a phase dominated by partonic collectivity .    in this contribution we further demonstrate ; ( i ) the partonic origin of @xmath0 via scaling tests for the @xmath7 meson ; ( ii ) essentially full thermalization for the charm quark via scaling tests for d meson @xmath0 ; and ( iii ) validate universal scaling of @xmath0 in au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath1  gev .",
    "differential @xmath0 measurements for multi - strange hadrons (  @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9  ) allow us to address the important question of how the existence of a hadronic phase affects @xmath0 .",
    "these particles are to have a small hadronic cross section for interaction with non - strange hadrons . consequently ,",
    "if elliptic flow was established in a phase involving hadrons interacting with their standard hadronic cross sections ( post - hadronization ) , one would expect @xmath0 for the multi - strange hadrons to be significantly smaller than that for other hadrons ( e.g. @xmath10 , k , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .  1 compares phenix @xmath0 results for the @xmath7 meson , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 from 20 - 60% central au+au collisions ; they show that , despite its mass which is comparable to that for the @xmath10 and @xmath15 , its @xmath16 values are similar to those for the lighter mesons ( @xmath11 and @xmath17 ) whose hadronic re - scattering cross sections are expected to be large . the right panel of fig .  1 shows the positive results from a validation test for universal scaling of the @xmath7 meson @xmath0 .",
    "the recent high - statistics preliminary star results for @xmath9 and @xmath8 produced in au+au collisions at @xmath18  gev @xcite show a similar universal scaling @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath0 values for hadrons comprised of u , d and s quarks develop in the partonic phase and the existence of a hadronic phase does not lead to their modification .",
    "further insight into properties of the produced medium at rhic can be obtained from the study of elliptic flow of particles comprised of heavy quarks ( charm or bottom ) . if charm quarks flow like light quarks",
    ", it would indicate an unexpectedly strong interaction of charm with the medium .",
    "one method of accessing charm @xmath0 is to measure the @xmath0 for  non - photonic \" electrons @xcite . a recent high statistics phenix measurements show rather larger elliptic flow for  non - photonic \" electrons from au+au collsions at @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "the  non - photonic \" electrons arise mainly from d meson decay for @xmath19 2gev / c .",
    "therefore , the large heavy flavor electron @xmath0 indicates that the d meson and consequently the charm quark , do flow with a large @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the in - medium interactions are strong and perhaps frequent enough to thermalize the charm quark .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then @xmath16 for the d meson should show the same universal scaling presented earlier for other hadrons .",
    "the @xmath0 values for d mesons can been obtained from the values for non - photonic electrons via detailed simulations , see @xcite for details . for these simulations , it is necessary to assume the shape for @xmath20 for the d mesons .",
    "the left and right panels of fig .  2",
    "compare the unscaled and scaled results ( respectively ) for @xmath0 vs. @xmath5 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons measured in minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev . here",
    ", the assumed shape for the @xmath23 dependence of the d meson @xmath0 is that for the proton ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption is compatible with a large array of differential @xmath0 measurements for different  heavy \" particle species @xcite .",
    "both panels of fig .",
    "2 show robust scaling ; they confirm that the d mesons ( for @xmath24 gev / c ) and hence , their associated charm quarks , flow with a fluid velocity field similar to that for the other quarks .",
    "this suggests that the medium responds as a thermalized fluid and the transport mean free path is small .",
    "if @xmath0 develops in a phase dominated by partonic collectivity and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 quarks flow with a common velocity field , one expects universal scaling for all particle species measured at rhic .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows differential flow measurements @xmath20 , for several particle species produced at mid - rapidity in central and semi - central au+au collisions at @xmath29=200 gev ; they span essentially the full range of measurements ( several hundred data points ) at rhic .",
    "the @xmath0 values for pions ( @xmath30 ) , kaons @xmath13 , ( anti-)protons ( @xmath31,p ) , ( anti-)deuterons ( @xmath32)d and the @xmath7 meson comprise results from the phenix @xcite .",
    "the values for neutral kaons ( @xmath33 ) , lambdas ( @xmath34 ) , cascades ( @xmath35 ) and omegas ( @xmath36 ) represent results from the star @xcite .",
    "3  ( b ) shows the scaled results ( @xmath37 vs @xmath3 ) obtained from the same data ; here @xmath38 is the integral @xmath0 of charged hadrons for each of the indicated centrality selections , multiplied by a constant factor @xmath39 ( i.e. @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "recent measurements @xcite indicate that @xmath41 is independent of centrality and the size of the colliding system as would be expected from a hydrodynamic system .",
    "3(b ) indicates that the relatively complicated dependence of @xmath0 on centrality , transverse momentum , particle type , etc .",
    ", for particles produced at mid - rapidity can be scaled to a single function .",
    "1(c ) demonstrates that the same scaling also holds for @xmath12,(@xmath13 ) and ( @xmath31,p ) produced at mid - rapidity in cu+cu collisions at @xmath29=200 gev .     vs. @xmath23 and ( b ) @xmath42 ) vs. @xmath3 for several centralities and particle species as indicated .",

    "validation tests for the universal scaling of @xmath0 at rhic , suggest that the transverse expansion dynamics leading to elliptic flow are not controlled by ordinary hadrons interacting with their standard hadronic cross sections . instead , they suggest a pre - hardonization state exhibiting partonic collectivity leading to the flow of light , strange and heavy quarks with a common expansion velocity field .",
