    "solar neutrino experiments measure an energy - dependent flux suppression  @xcite relative to the standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite .",
    "this situation has existed for thirty years and every new solar neutrino experiment has confirmed the flux - deficit .",
    "the best motivated explanation of this solar neutrino puzzle is that neutrinos are massive and undergo oscillations .",
    "the energy dependence of the flux suppression singles out very specific regions in the space of parameters that govern the frequency and amplitude of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the solar - neutrino flux deficit can be accounted for by oscillations of electron neutrinos to mu and/or tau neutrinos or to sterile neutrinos that do not interact weakly . in the two - neutrino oscillation framework ,",
    "oscillations into sterile neutrinos are excluded at the 95% c. l.  @xcite by a comparison of the day and night spectra at super - kamiokande ( super  k ) and the results of a global flux analysis ; hence the favored explanation is oscillations . for such oscillations ,",
    "there are three regions ( lma , sma and low ) in the mass - squared difference @xmath7 and vacuum amplitude @xmath8 parameters for the three solutions are @xmath9 ( lma ) , @xmath10 ( sma ) and @xmath11 ( low ) . ] .",
    "these solutions involve effects from coherent @xmath12 scattering from matter  @xcite in the earth and the sun . of these regions ,",
    "the sma region is disfavored at the 95% c. l. because of the observed flat energy spectrum and imperceptible day / night effect at super  k  @xcite . for this reason we drop further consideration of the sma region .",
    "a fourth region , the vac or just - so solution , which is largely independent of matter effects , is also excluded at the 95% c. l. by the same considerations that disfavor the sma solution .",
    "thus , we are left with the lma and low regions , both of which have large mixing . with a large measure of certainty the kamland  @xcite experiment will exclude or confirm the lma region as a solution to the solar neutrino anomaly  @xcite . the sno experiment  @xcite will be crucial in validating the above conclusions from the super  k experiment  @xcite .    in this letter we first perform a simple neutrino oscillation - independent analysis ( with ssm fluxes ) of the solar neutrino data using the total rates at the @xmath13cl  @xcite and @xmath14ga  @xcite experiments and super  k , following the procedure proposed in ref .",
    "we make predictions for the charged - current ( cc ) rate at the sno experiment . allowing the @xmath0b flux normalization to be free",
    ", we derive a relation for the neutral - current ( nc ) rate at sno in terms of the cc rate at sno in a model - independent way .",
    "our analysis is suited to the lma and low solutions for which the oscillations in matter are mainly adiabatic .",
    "we find the relative flux suppression of the high , intermediate , and low energy solar neutrinos , compared to the ssm , and how these suppressions depend on the normalization of the solar @xmath0b neutrino flux .",
    "we then apply our analysis to the lma and low solutions and approximately reproduce the results of more comprehensive fits .",
    "finally , we predict the cc and nc rates at sno for the @xmath0b flux normalization obtained by imposing adiabatic constraints .",
    "following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , we divide the solar neutrino spectra into three parts : high energy ( consisting of @xmath0b and @xmath15 neutrinos ) , intermediate energy ( @xmath16be , @xmath17 , @xmath18o , and @xmath19n ) , and low energy ( @xmath20 ) . for each class of solar neutrino experiment",
    "the fractional contribution without oscillations to the expected rate from each part of the spectrum can be calculated in the ssm ( see table  [ tab : spectrum ] ) . if @xmath21 is the measured rate divided by the ssm prediction for a given experiment , then with oscillations , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the average survival probabilities for the high , intermediate , and low energy solar neutrinos . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rcl ] ) and ( [ eq : rga ] ) we assume that each probability remains the same from experiment to experiment , which is justified since the differential event rate without oscillations for each part of the spectrum has approximately the same shape for all experiments  @xcite .",

    "the super  k rate depends only on the high energy neutrinos , so @xmath23 is directly determined by @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : snorangea ] ) and ( [ eq : snoranges ] ) are partially non - overlapping , a differentiation between the active and sterile scenarios from cc data alone could be possible .",
    "one approach to the uncertainty of the @xmath0b flux is to assume that the @xmath0b neutrinos are not suppressed at all by oscillations ( or other particle physics mechanisms ) , and hence that the super  k experiment is providing a direct measurement of the @xmath0b flux .",
    "then the implications of the @xmath13cl and @xmath14ga data on @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be examined .",
    "this scenario can be modeled by fixing @xmath51 , the value of data / ssm measured by super ",

    "there are two degrees of freedom , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and two data points .",
    "the unique solution , with @xmath55 , is @xmath56 while this best - fit solution lies outside the physical region , a solution with @xmath57 and @xmath58 is nearly as good , giving a @xmath39 of 0.2 . at 95.4%",
    "we find that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "hence for this scenario to be a good description of the data , the intermediate energy neutrinos are strongly suppressed , while the low energy neutrinos are not greatly suppressed . only a vacuum solution with @xmath61 and large mixing can give such probabilities  @xcite ; however , the global analysis of ref .",

    "once adiabatic constraints are included for the msw solutions with large mixing , the number of free parameters is three , and the best - fit line collapses to a best - fit point marked by the cross ; we will discuss this in section  [ sec : free ] .    for sterile neutrinos ,",

    "we define @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) as the fraction of those neutrinos that are created above resonance ; then @xmath88 in eq .  (",

    "the resonance condition depends directly on the neutrino energy . for a given @xmath7",

    "can not be above resonance until all of the neutrinos with higher energy are also above resonance , we see immediately that msw solutions must have @xmath96 .",

    "for example , when @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , @xmath110  ev@xmath6 implies a critical energy of about 3  mev , so that all of the high energy neutrinos and none of the low and intermediate energy neutrinos are created above resonance ; this corresponds to @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",

    "this would be very hard to understand in the lma solution , because the high energy neutrinos typically start above resonance ( with @xmath126 ) and the low and intermediate energy neutrinos typically start below resonance ( with @xmath127 ) ; since @xmath128 for @xmath129 , this implies @xmath130 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath68 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are higher than @xmath23 , which is qualitatively consistent with the lma solution . by imposing the condition @xmath131 , required for an msw solution with @xmath129 , fig .",
