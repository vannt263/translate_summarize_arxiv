    "in a series of papers [ 1 - 5 ] , zamick and his collaborators investigated the spectra of even - even and even - odd nuclei in the pf region .",
    "the authors used the shell model calculations in a single open shell for both protons and neutrons .",
    "they remarked that for some even - even nuclei , the @xmath1 excited states were at twice the energies of @xmath2 excited states in the neighboring even - odd nuclei , in a single j shell calculation for any isospin conserving interaction .",
    "examples of this type are the pairs ( @xmath3ti,@xmath4sc ) , ( @xmath3ti,@xmath4ti ) , ( @xmath5ti,@xmath6ti ) , ( @xmath5ti,@xmath7sc ) . in order that this relationship holds it",
    "is necessary that the diagonalization spaces for the odd and even systems are equal to each other . for the nuclei mentioned above the prove",
    "was analytically given in ref .",
    "the states mentioned above for the even - odd and even - even isotopes can be viewed as single ( sa ) and double analog ( da ) states , respectively .    for the combination ( @xmath8ti , @xmath9sc ) and the cross conjugate pair(@xmath10cr , @xmath11cr ) one almost gets a 2 to 1 relation , which becomes precisely 2 to 1 if one does not allow admixtures of seniority @xmath12 states in the ground states of the even - even nuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite the excitation energies of higher isospin states were parametrised by linear relations @xmath13 these are equivalent to a quadratic expression for the binding energies @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . for wigner su(4 ) model",
    "y is equal to 4 and x=2.5 .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit the above problem for the isotopes of ti .",
    "we suppose that the states of interest are mainly determined by the valence nucleons in the @xmath16 shell , which interact among themselves through an isospin invariant pairing force .",
    "the sa states are populated in a ( p , n ) reaction process@xcite .",
    "thus , the ground state ( @xmath17 ) of the target nucleus ( @xmath18 ) ( often called mother nucleus ) , is transformed by the isospin raising operator equal to @xmath19 respectively . ]",
    "@xmath20 to the state ( @xmath21 ) describing the daughter nucleus ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this state is certainly an excited state , the daughter nucleus ground state being a ( @xmath23 ) state .",
    "the sa state has the same quantum numbers as the ground state of the mother nucleus except for @xmath24 which is by one unit smaller than the initial value .",
    "this state can be described either by a neutron hole - proton particle tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) applied to the mother system or by diagonalizing a many body hamiltonian associated to the daughter nucleus within a @xmath25 basis .",
    "considering now the daughter nucleus in the sa state as a target , one may define again , by a ( p , n ) process , a new sa state .",
    "this is a da state with respect to the initial mother nucleus and has the isospin quantum numbers ( t , t-2 ) . according to the above considerations this state can be obtained by two successive tda phonon excitations of the ground state of the mother nucleus . roughly speaking the sa energy is about the shift of proton single particle energy due to the coulomb interaction and symmetry energy , the deviation being caused by the proton - neutron residual interaction .",
    "the remark of zamick and his collaborators is that in some ti even isotopes the excitation energy of the da states is twice as much as the excitation energy of sa in the neighboring even - odd ti isotopes . for illustration",
    ", an example is given in figs . 1 , 2",
    ". the question is of course , whether this is a general feature or is mainly determined by the interaction regime ( strong or weak ) between the odd nucleons and the core on one side and between odd nucleons on other side .",
    "the states whose energies are suspected to provide a ratio of two to one are considered as approximate eigenstates of the model hamiltonian , which will be treated within a generalized bcs formalism .",
    "the corresponding energies are obtained as average values of the many body hamiltonian on @xmath26 projected states , generated by the generalized bcs ground state . as in a previous publication @xcite",
    ", we restrict the space of single particle states to a proton single @xmath27 and a neutron single @xmath28 shell with @xmath29 .    the results are presented as follows . in section",
    "ii , the even - even system is presented . since the results for such systems were earlier described in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we collect only the main results in order to facilitate a self - consistent picture .",
    "section iii is devoted to the even - odd system .",
    "numerical results are commented in section iv and the final conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the many body systems for mother and daughter nuclei are described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath30 where the following notations have been used : @xmath31 in a previous paper , two of us ( a.a.r . and e.m.g . )",
    "approached the generalized bcs ground state by a wave function obtained by rotating the ground state of a proton - neutron pairing hamiltonian in the isospin space .",
    "rotation angles depend on the quantum numbers defining the proton - neutron pair . @xmath32    where the standard notation for the bcs ground state of the p - n pairing hamiltonian , @xmath33 , and the rotation in the space of the many body states : @xmath34 have been used .",
    "the transformation @xmath35 has the meaning of a collective rotation which fixes the orientation of the intrinsic - like frame in the space of isospin .",
    "thus @xmath36 plays the role of an intrinsic state while @xmath33 of an auxiliary intrinsic state .",
    "clearly the function @xmath36 breaks the gauge and isospin symmetries .",
    "these symmetries can be restored by a projection procedure , and the resulting states are : @xmath37 . in what follows",
    "we give , therefore , the useful results for the case of a single j - shell .",
    "to simplify the notations we omit the index j specifying the shell .",
    "semi - degeneracy of the j - shell is denoted by @xmath38    the norm for the state @xmath39 is : @xmath40 the projected states energy characterizing the even - even system of valence nucleons is analytically given by :    @xmath41\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath42 is defined in appendix a",
    "the projected state describing the even - odd system is defined by : @xmath43 the norm of the state @xmath44 has the expression : @xmath45,~n = even.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath46 are those defined in appendix a. alternatively , the norm of the projected state describing an odd number of nucleons can be expressed in terms of norms associated to the even system : @xmath47 following the procedure described in ref.@xcite , one can express the energy for the even - odd system as : @xmath48 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & z^{(\\pi)}(\\frac{n}{2},p)\\frac{4(-2)^{p+1}}{\\sqrt{2 } }   \\left[(2p+1 ) \\left(\\omega-\\frac{n}{2}+p+1\\right ) \\left ( \\matrix{\\omega -1\\cr p}\\right ) \\left(\\matrix{2\\omega-2p-2 \\cr\\frac{n}{2}-2p-1}\\right)\\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2(p+1)(p+2 ) \\left .",
    "( \\matrix{\\omega -1\\cr p+1}\\right ) \\left(\\matrix{2\\omega-2(p+1)-2 \\cr\\frac{n}{2}-2(p+1)-1}\\right ) -(p+1 ) \\left",
    "( \\matrix{\\omega -1\\cr p+1}\\right ) \\left(\\matrix{2\\omega-2(p+1)-1 \\cr\\frac{n}{2}-2(p+1)}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the factors z defined in appendix a. also the notation @xmath49 for the state semi - degeneracy is used .",
    "the odd system can be described within a particle - core coupled basis : @xmath50 stands for the odd neutron wave function in the laboratory frame .",
    "of course the isospin projections in the intrinsic frame satisfy the equation @xmath51 since the even system states are @xmath52 states , it results that the odd system states are @xmath2 states    in order to treat the many body hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) in the basis defined above it is convenient to separate it into three parts describing the two components of the system as well as their mutual interaction : @xmath53 we assume that the coupling term is simulated by a scalar operator with respect to isospin rotations : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the isospin operators acting on the state describing the odd particle and the even - even core , respectively .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , each state of the odd system can be obtained uniquely by coupling the odd neutron isospin to a single isospin state from the core space .",
    "for example the isospin 3/2 of @xmath7ti can be obtained by coupling the odd neutron isospin to the state of the even core with t=1 while the state 5/2 originates from the coupling of the odd particle to the @xmath57 core state .",
    "another remark which is pertinent is that the low isospin state in the odd system is obtained by aligning the odd neutron isospin to the core isospin . by contrary for the higher isospin state an anti - alignment of the two isospin takes place .",
    "this property holds for all even - odd pairs of isotopes considered here . as a consequence",
    "the particle core interaction is repulsive in lowest isospin states and attractive in the higher isospin ones . for particle",
    "core coupling models it is customary to adopt the approximations @xmath58 the average for the core hamiltonian has been calculated in section ii , being given by the eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) . in this way",
    "the excitation energies in odd isotopes are related to those in the neighboring even - even ones by : @xmath59",
    "here we consider the sa states in odd and da states in even mass isotopes of ti.the energies for the lowest isospin states in each case are obtained as expectation values of the many body hamiltonian on the particle number and isospin projected states .",
    "excitation energies depend on the pairing strength g. this is fixed so that the experimental values of the excitation energies are reproduced . in this way",
    "we want to explore effects like the dependence of g on the atomic mass number , the blocking due to the odd particle as well as whether the v=0 ( v denotes seniority quantum number ) description suffices for both even - even and even - odd nuclei . as we stated from the beginning",
    "we restrict the space of single particle states to a single j shell , i.e. @xmath60 . the excitation energies obtained in this way are given in table 1 .",
    "the values of g obtained through the fitting procedure mentioned above are plotted in figs .",
    "3 - 6 . as function of a. in the first figures we omitted the value of g for @xmath9ti which is quite large ( @xmath61mev ) .",
    "the large values of g for the lowest mass odd isotopes might be caused by the fact that the restriction of the many body states to the v=0 subspace is unrealistic and the neglected contribution is compensated through an artificial increase of the paring strength .",
    "also the blocking effect of the odd particle which , as a matter of fact , is neglected here , is suspected to be large . for the last two pairs of isotopes ( @xmath8ti,@xmath7ti ) and",
    "( @xmath5ti , @xmath6ti ) the pairing strengths are fairly close to each other .",
    "moreover the ordering of the g value for even - even and even - odd isotopes is opposite to that of the case of light isotopes . as shown in fig .",
    "4 the pairing strength falls on a third degree polynomial in a. the a dependence of g is plotted separately for even - even and even - odd isotopes in figs . 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "while in the even a case the points are almost collinear , for odd isotopes the pairing strengths lie on a gaussian curve .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparing the values of f and g given in table 2 one remarks that f is almost half the value of g.    coming back to eq .",
    "( 18 ) and using @xmath62 one obtains for the excitation energies in the odd isotopes the values 4.672 , 4.672 , 7.104 and 7.698 mev , respectively .",
    "we remark that the last two values listed above are close to the experimental values in @xmath7ti and @xmath6ti , respectively , while for @xmath4ti and @xmath9ti the deviations are equal to 334 and 496 kev respectively .",
    "thus one could state that we obtained a quite reasonable description of the excitation energies of sa and da states in ti isotopes using only one parameter , the pairing strength , which is depending linearly on a.    denoting by t=@xmath63 the ground state isospin , one arrives at very simple expressions for sa and da excitation energies in terms of isospin : @xmath64 , ~~\\rm{a = even}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for even - odd isotopes one should take the expression of g the value of a corresponding to the neighboring even - even - core .",
    "if the small deviation of f from @xmath65 is not ignored then the sa excitation energy is given by :    @xmath66,~~\\rm { a = odd}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    recalling that @xmath67 where the sign minus holds for @xmath4ti , it is clear that the above equations provide quadratic expressions of t for sa and da excitation energies .",
    "excitation energies for sa ( single analog ) and da ( double analog ) states in even - odd and even - even isotopes of ti , respectively , have been described with a many body isospin invariant hamiltonian in a single j - shell .",
    "the states describing the neighboring even - even and even - odd isotopes are obtained through an n , t projection procedure from a generalized proton - neutron bcs wave function .",
    "the pairing strength for even - even systems depend linearly on the atomic mass number a. it is worth mentioning that the group theory formula produces identical results for excitation energies as the projection procedure .",
    "alternatively the even - odd systems are described in a particle - core coupling scheme where the coupling interaction is an isospin invariant operator acting on both odd particle and core degrees of freedom .",
    "the fitted strength for the coupling term is almost half the pairing strength .",
    "taking into account that the excitation energy for the even system is analytically given by a very simple formula , it results that the present paper provides also a compact expression for the excitation energy in even - odd isotopes .",
    "since g depends linearly on a one may conclude that the excitation energies in the seven isotopes considered here , are fairly well obtained by fixing only two free parameters .",
    "finally , analytical expressions for a quadratic dependence on t for sa and da excitation energies are obtained .",
    "here we give the analytical expressions for the overlap integrals which enter the formulae determining the energies for even - even and even - odd systems .",
