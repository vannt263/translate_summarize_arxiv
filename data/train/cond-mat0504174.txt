    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) is the basic microscopic model for the investigation of compounds with heavy - fermion or intermediate valence properties such as cerium or uranium @xcite .",
    "the model describes @xmath1 electrons which interact via a strong on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 and hybridize with noninteracting @xmath2 electrons . in the simplest case",
    "the @xmath1 electrons are assumed dispersionless , the hybridization purely local , and the @xmath2 electron hopping nonzero only between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "however , for real systems this is an oversimplification since there is experimental evidence for ( i ) a weak , but finite dispersion of the @xmath1 electrons , especially in uranium compounds @xcite , ( ii ) nonlocal contributions to the hybridization , and ( iii ) hopping of the @xmath2 electrons beyond nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "recently the pam was employed to study the dramatic volume collapse at the @xmath5 transition in cerium compounds.@xcite these investigations called attention to the possibility of a mott metal - insulator transition in the pam . in fact , a remarkable similarity between the hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping @xcite and the pam with nearest neighbor hybridization and @xmath2 hopping @xcite was found .",
    "these results show that the range of the hopping and hybridization in the pam are quite important but still poorly understood .    in this situation",
    "exact results on the existence of insulating and metallic phases in the pam and their dependence on the hopping , hybridization , and interaction parameters are particularly desirable  especially in three dimensions .",
    "so far exact results for the pam were mostly limited to special regions of parameter space , namely , for infinite repulsion of the @xmath1 electrons tizegy , tizket , tizhar , and for finite repulsion in low dimensions @xmath6",
    "@xcite    in this paper we not only present details of the construction and the physical properties of a class of exact ground states of three - dimensional ( @xmath7 ) periodic anderson models reported in ref.@xcite , but extend the range of applicability of our approach substantially .",
    "in particular , we ( i ) demonstrate the uniqueness of the metallic and insulating solutions discovered at @xmath0 filling @xcite , ( ii ) explicitly present and analyze the non  linear matching conditions connecting the starting hamiltonian to the transformed hamiltonian , ( iii ) deduce the current operator and the sum rule for the charge conductivity , ( iv ) derive several local and global expectation values such as the magnetization of the system , ( v ) calculate correlation functions , ( vi ) extend the solutions to the conventional pam case , and ( vii ) show that , by employing different procedures to cast the hamiltonian into positive semi - definite form , one arrives at exact ground states in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the hamiltonian , discuss its transformation into positive semi - definite form , and construct a class of exact ground states .",
    "section iii describes the localized solution , and section iv characterizes the metallic non - fermi liquid state . in section v the approach is generalized , leading to solutions in other regions of parameter space , and in section vi the results are summarized .",
    "technical details are discussed in appendices a - e.",
    "we consider a general form of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) describing non - interacting @xmath2 electrons which hybridize with interacting @xmath1 electrons .",

    "the vector @xmath31 must be properly defined . to this end",

    "the remaining ( negative ) values of @xmath31  are taken into account in ( [ eq3 ] ) by the @xmath38 contributions .      to construct exact ground states the hamiltonian @xmath48 needs to be rewritten in terms of positive semi - definite operators .",
    "this is made possible@xcite by the construction of two new operators ",

    "the composite operators @xmath51 do not obey canonical anticommutation rules , since @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "this is because @xmath57 creates electrons also at the boundaries of the unit cell @xmath39 with neighboring unit cells .",
    "it should be stressed that for this reason @xmath58 has a genuine dependence on the lattice structure and thereby on the spatial dimension .",
    "furthermore the relations @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 imply @xmath62    the second operator , @xmath63 , originates from the relation @xmath64 , where @xmath65and @xmath66 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the local operators @xmath67 are positive semi - definite and assume their lowest eigenvalue ( = 0 ) whenever there is _ at least",

    "by contrast , the interaction operator @xmath68 itself , which is also positive semi - definite for @xmath69 , assumes the eigenvalue 0 only if the double occupancy is _",

    "for ( [ ham ] ) to reproduce ( [ eq1 ] ) the prefactors @xmath53 in @xmath74 must be expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath29 , @xmath79 , @xmath30 , @xmath80 , for all @xmath81 , taking into account periodic boundary conditions .",

    "a state @xmath88 which fulfills the conditions",
    "@xmath89 for all @xmath25 , and which contains all linearly independent states with properties ( [ eq15],[eq16 ] ) , will then be the exact ground state of @xmath87 with energy @xmath86 .",
    "since the kernel of an arbitrary operator @xmath90 , @xmath91 , is defined by the linearly independent states @xmath92 satisfying @xmath93 , the relations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) define the kernel of the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "consequently , @xmath88 spans the common part of @xmath96 and @xmath97 denoted by the hilbert space @xmath98 using this definition it is ensured that @xmath88 is the complete ground state , and that supplementary degeneracies of @xmath86 do not occur .    using ( [ pp ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) it follows that @xmath96 is defined by states @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are arbitrary coefficients .",

    "clearly , @xmath88 has the desired property @xmath108 and spans @xmath109 at @xmath0 filling .",
    "thus it is the exact ground state of @xmath87 with energy @xmath86 .",
    "since the operator @xmath102 was introduced into @xmath88 to take into account the operator @xmath94 in ( [ ham ] ) , i.e. , the hubbard interaction @xmath3 , @xmath88 can only be a ground state for @xmath69 .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) implies that ( i ) the linearly independent basis vectors of @xmath110 have the form @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , and ( ii ) @xmath105 does not contribute to the total spin of the ground state .",
    "the overall degeneracy and total spin @xmath113 $ ] of @xmath88 are then determined only by the ( arbitrary ) set of coefficients @xmath114 ( see also sect .",
    "iii.a.2 . , sect.iv.e . , and footnote [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "consequently , the degeneracy of @xmath115 is determined by the ( high ) spin degeneracy of @xmath88 .",
    "since in @xmath88 all possible values @xmath116 and orientations @xmath117 occur the ground state is globally non - magnetic @xcite .",
    "exact ground states can also be constructed away from @xmath0 filling .",
    "for example , the operator @xmath118 $ ] with numerical coefficients @xmath119 creates @xmath120 additional particles into the system such that @xmath106 \\hat v^{\\dagger}_m | 0 \\rangle \\label{eq19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a ground state for @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the physical properties of @xmath88 depend on the values of the coefficients @xmath123 in ( [ eq7 ] ) which are solutions of ( [ eq12 ] ) for given microscopic parameters .",
    "we now identify different solutions for nonlocal hybridization amplitudes with @xmath124 and discuss their physical properties .",
    "we start with a localized ground state at @xmath0 filling .      from ( [ eq7 ] )",
    "it follows that if @xmath125 and @xmath126 are proportional , i.e. , @xmath127 for all @xmath128 , the operators @xmath129 take the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "the ground state @xmath88 , ( [ eq18 ] ) , then transforms into @xmath132 .",
    "evaluating the product @xmath133 , one finds @xmath134 |0 \\rangle .",

    "the state @xmath136 has exactly three particles on each site , corresponding to a uniform electron distribution in the system .",
    "indeed , for @xmath137 one finds latexmath:[$\\hat n_{\\mathbf{i } } |\\psi_{loc}\\rangle = 3    of @xmath136 by @xmath139 , one obtains @xmath140 for all @xmath141 and all @xmath142 . hence hopping or non - local hybridization does not occur .    by separating the hamiltonian @xmath87 into an itinerant part @xmath143 and a complementary localized part @xmath144 ( see appendix b ) , and using ( [ eq24 ] ) , one finds @xmath145 for all @xmath31 , and @xmath146 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the localized nature of the ground state .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ b7 ] ) , the sum rule for the charge conductivity is obtained as @xmath147 . since @xmath148 is non - negative this relation implies @xmath149 . in particular , @xmath150 , the dc - conductivity , is also zero . the ground state ( [ eq23 ] ) is therefore insulating @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the nature of this state is quite nontrivial , since the localization of the electrons is due to a subtle quantum mechanical interference between states with two @xmath2 and one @xmath1 electron ( @xmath151 ) and two @xmath1 and one @xmath2 electron ( @xmath152 ) on every site @xmath25 .    a state with @xmath153 for all @xmath154 appears to be rather unphysical since it implies that not only the dc - conductivity but even the dynamic conductivity vanishes for all excitation energies .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the relation @xmath155 was derived in the framework of the kubo formula for the charge conductivity , i.e. , within linear response theory .",
    "consequently , this result is not valid at high excitation energies @xmath154 .",
    "the expectation value of the spin @xcite in terms of the ground state ( [ eq23 ] ) in cartesian coordinates is found as @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "the total spin is seen to depend on the arbitrary coefficients @xmath158 . here",
    "the site dependence of the @xmath101 coefficients should be stressed .",
    "namely , by choosing @xmath159 one obtains @xmath160 , leading to @xmath161 in the thermodynamic limit ; @xmath162 is seen to influence only the orientation of @xmath117 .",
    "the minimal total spin can be found by considering two distinct subsystems of arbitrary shape , both containing the same number of lattice sites @xmath163 .",
    "taking @xmath164 in each subsystem one finds @xmath165 which implies zero total spin ( i.e. , a global singlet state ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "depending on the choice of the parameters @xmath166 all values of @xmath116 between these two extreme values for @xmath116 , and all orientations of @xmath167 , can be constructed ( see sec.ii.c ) .      analyzing the local magnetic properties of the ground state one",
    "observes that the expectation value of the double occupancy per site for both @xmath9 electrons is smaller than unity since @xmath168 .",
    "consequently , each site carries a local moment .",
    "indeed , irrespective of the values of @xmath101 and @xmath169 one has @xmath170 on each site @xmath25 ; this is the result of a quantum mechanical superposition of the corresponding contributions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 moments do not compensate each other locally since @xmath171 where @xmath172 holds .",
    "furthermore , taking into account fixed ( but arbitrary ) @xmath101 the spin - spin correlation function for @xmath173 is found as @xmath174 an average over all possible values of @xmath175 therefore implies @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , in spite of the existence of local moments the system is globally non - magnetic ; this is a consequence of the large spin degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "the matching conditions ( [ eq12 ] ) for the nonlocal hybridization amplitudes along the space diagonals of the unit cell read @xmath177 they hold for all @xmath20 , @xmath21 and hence imply @xmath178 .",
    "since for real @xmath169 , ( [ eq12 ] ) leads to the relations @xmath179 _ real _ @xmath169 are seen to imply _ real _ hybridization amplitudes .",
    "in addition to ( [ eq35 ] ) , ( [ eq12 ] ) yields the following system of 14 coupled nonlinear equations @xmath180 they determine the unknown complex coefficients @xmath181 ( i.e. , 16 unknown real values ) from the input parameters @xmath182 .",
    "a study of the possible solutions shows that for @xmath183 the _ relative _ sizes of the hopping and hybridization amplitudes are physically very reasonable , e.g. , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "that is , they decrease with distance , and the magnitude of the amplitudes of the @xmath2 electrons is larger than those of the almost localized @xmath1 electrons .      for a simple cubic lattice one has @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 .",
    "then ( [ eq36 ] ) has a solution @xmath191 where @xmath192 is an arbitrary , real quantity which is fixed by the energy unit . furthermore , @xmath193 is real and is determined by the parameters entering in @xmath87 through ( [ eq36],[eq37 ] ) .",
    "due to the almost localized nature of the @xmath1 electrons their nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude can be expected to be much smaller than that of the @xmath2 electrons .",
    "indeed , for @xmath194 the ground state energy is given by @xmath195 where @xmath196 , and @xmath197 $ ] holds .",
    "we see that @xmath136 ceases to be the ground state for @xmath198 .",
    "this corresponds to rather strong next - nearest neighbor hopping of @xmath2 electrons .",
    "apparently , at @xmath199 a different  most probably itinerant  phase becomes stable . at @xmath200",
    "the ground state energy @xmath201 has a finite value , but its derivative diverges due to @xmath202 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "since the size of the hopping element may be tuned by pressure , the infinite slope of @xmath86 at @xmath203 is expected to correspond to an _ anomaly in the volume _ , or the compressibility , at a critical pressure @xmath204 .",
    "such a feature is indeed observed in some heavy - fermion materials @xcite .",
    "similar results may be deduced for other lattice structures . in the most general case ,",
    "i.e. , when all hopping amplitudes @xmath182 are different , the ground state energy for the localized solution becomes @xmath205 ( see ( [ c8 ] ) in appendix c ) is mathematically no longer defined the localized solution becomes unstable .",
    "except for accidental cancellations in the ground state energy an infinite slope of @xmath86 as a function of the hopping amplitudes is also found in this more general case ( see appendix c ) .",
    "the localized ground state discussed above has exactly three electrons per site . in general , however , the inter - site hopping and hybridization will lead to a variable number of electrons on each site . in that case",
    "the ground state @xmath88 , ( [ eq18 ] ) , becomes conducting .",
    "we will now describe solutions of this kind .",
    "the solutions obtained sofar , namely ( [ eq34]-[eq38 ] ) , and ( [ eq42]-[eq46 ] ) , require the @xmath1 electrons to be itinerant , i.e. , @xmath227",
    ". we will now show that exact itinerant ground states can even be constructed for the _ conventional _ pam , i.e. , for @xmath228 .",
    "this requires nonzero @xmath2-electron hopping up to next - nearest neighbors together with local and nearest - neighbor hybridizations .",
    "such a solution can be constructed , for example , for nonzero coefficients @xmath229 , with the remaining coefficients @xmath230 .",
    "this is realized in a tilted unit cell ( see fig.4 ) where the distances between lattice sites with indices @xmath231 and corresponding hopping elements @xmath232 are considerably larger than the distances between lattice sites with indices @xmath233 and hopping elements @xmath234 .",
    "for this reason the former hopping elements are neglected ( i.e. , put to zero ) . in this case ( eq12 )",
    "reduces to the following eleven equations @xmath235 where @xmath236 , and all other amplitudes are identically zero .    considering only the simplest case",

    "further properties of the solution are discussed in footnotes [ @xcite ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath245 with @xmath246 does not hold for all @xmath247 , implies a variable number of electrons at each site , i.e. , an itinerant ground state .      to describe properties of the itinerant state ,",

    "the lower ( upper ) diagonalized band contains fermions created by @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) , respectively . since the total band filling is @xmath0 the lower band",

    "however , the sum rule does not allow us to draw conclusions about the dc - conductivity @xmath271 .",
    "this becomes possible if we calculate the chemical potential of the system as a function of the particle number . to this end",
    "we observe that in the case of a variable number of particles per site the itinerant ground state is defined at _ and _ above @xmath0 filling , such that @xmath88 in ( [ eq18 ] ) can be generalized to fillings beyond @xmath0 via ( [ eq19 ] ) . using ( [ ham ] )",
