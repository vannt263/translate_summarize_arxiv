    "from the energy spectrum of an amorphous semiconductor@xcite , one knows that there are four types of carrier transitions that may contribute to the electric conduction : type ( 1 ) transition between two localized states ; type ( 2 ) transition from a localized state to an extended state ; type ( 3 ) transition from an extended state to a localized state and type ( 4 ) transition between two extended states .",
    "type ( 4 ) transition is common to both crystalline and non - crystalline materials . for amorphous semiconductors , type ( 1 )",
    "transition is the main conduction mechanism in a broad temperature range .",
    "it has been investigated in various ways@xcite .",
    "although the thermal equilibrium population of the extended states is lower than the population of the localized states , the contribution from the carriers in the extended states to the electric conduction is still observable for a moderately high temperature .",
    "an investigation of the transitions of type ( 2 ) , type ( 3 ) and type ( 4 ) is necessary for a complete description of carrier dynamics .    in other electronic hopping processes ,",
    "thermal vibrations of atoms also play an important role",
    ". electron transfer ( in polar solvent and inside large molecules)@xcite and polaron diffusion in a molecular crystal@xcite are two examples .",
    "the transition probability @xmath1 between two sites in a thermally activated process is given by the marcus formula@xmath2 where @xmath3 has the dimension of frequency for a specific hopping process .",
    "@xmath4 is the temperature dependent activation energy .",
    "@xmath5 is the reorganization energy , @xmath6 is the energy difference between the final state and the initial state@xcite .",
    "eq.([ea ] ) is valid for both electron transfer@xcite and small polaron hopping@xcite .",
    "the mathematical form of holstein s work for one dimensional molecular crystal is quite flexible and can be used to treat three dimensional materials with slight modifications@xcite .",
    "the effect of static disorder may be taken into account by replacing a fixed transfer integral with a distribution .",
    "the static disorder reduces the strength of the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling needed to stabilize global small - polaron fomation@xcite .",
    "amorphous semiconductors offer a different regime , in which the static disorder is so strong that the states in valence and conduction tails are localized .",
    "these localized states interact with the atomic vibrations",
    ".    we will extend holstein s work@xcite to amorphous semiconductors . in sec.ii , we first introduce some notation about localized states , extended states and electron - phonon interaction . then the equations of time evolution for localized states and extended states in presence of atomic vibrations are derived from a time - dependent schrodinger equation .",
    "the connections with electron transfer , with kramers problem of escape across a barrier and with small polarons are pointed out .",
    "in sec.iii we study the hopping processes among localized states ( ll ) in amorphous solids .",
    "eq.([ea ] ) is re - established in high temperature regime ( @xmath7 @xmath8 is the average phonon frequency , @xmath9 is the spectral distribution of phonons , the factor 2.5 comes from the requirement that the error of approximation csch@xmath10 is less than 0.003 , cf .",

    "fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the transition from a localized state to an extended state ( le ) induced by the transfer integral is reported in sec.iv , it has been suggested as the main conduction mechanism in amorphous silicon and is called ` phonon induced delocalization'@xcite . without the dressing effects of the vibrations of atoms , in certain sense , type ( 1 ) transition is similar to the transition between two bound states in a molecule and to the electron transfer between two ions , type ( 2 ) transition is analogous to the ionization process of an atom and to the escape across a potential barrier .    the transition from an extended state to a localized state ( el ) induced by the electron - phonon interaction , is presented in sec.v . in conduction band , the energy of an extended state is higher than that of a localized state in the lower tail . for an extended state with high enough energy ,",
    "el transition is in marcus inverted regime .",
    "one expects that there exists a short - lifetime belt of the extended states inside conduction band or valence band ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the states inside this belt favor non - radiative transitions by emitting several phonons",
    ". the conjectured short - lifetime belt in conduction band agrees the fact that the photoluminescence lifetime of a - si / sio@xmath0 quantum well decreases with frequency while that of c - si / sio@xmath0 is not sensitive to frequency .",
    "type ( 3 ) transition is similar to the free electron capture process in an atom and to the capture a particle by a well in a viscous liquid .",
    "one common feature of the type ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) transitions is that at higher temperature @xmath13 , the probability of any transition involving localized state takes the form of eq.([ea ] ) .",
    "we suggest that the observed drift mobility may originate from type ( 2 ) transitions .",

    "however for a localized state in amorphous semiconductor , the time spent from one localized state to another ( 10@xmath516m/10@xmath517m@xmath518sec@xmath519sec ) is much shorter than the stay time on one localized state ( @xmath520sec ) .",

    "for amorphous solids , following holstein s work on small polaron , we established the evolution equations for localized states and extended states in the presence of lattice vibrations ( eqs.([s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) ) . to simplify the evolution equations , for localized states , we restrict ourselves to the most localized ones .",

    "they also affect conductivity indirectly .    at ` very ' high temperature ( @xmath13 ) , the transition probabilities for the transitions of type ( 1 ) , type ( 2 ) and type ( 3 ) are reduced to an eq.([ea])-like formula .",
    "it is universal for the processes involving localized state .",

    "table i ) .",
    "type ( 4 ) transition deviates the direction of the drift motion along the direction of electric field and reduces conductivity .",
    "this is contrast with ll , le and el transition .",
    "the relative contribution to conductivity of four types of transition also highly depends on the number of  carriers in extended states and the number of carriers in localized states , which are determined by the extent of doping and temperature .    at low temperature ( @xmath530 ) , the non - diagonal transition is still multi - phonon activated process whatever it is ll , le or el transition .",
    "the activation energy is just half of the energy difference between final state and initial state ( @xmath544 @xmath545 @xmath546 ) .",
    "the reorganization of vibration configuration is not needed , this is similar to the hopping between mid - gap states@xcite which does not need reorganization of the static displacements@xcite .",

    "some important points are not addressed in this work .",
    "the overlap integral between two less localized states which spread in several distorted regions and the overlap integral between one less localized state and an extended state require the wave function of a less localized state which can not be described by a single exponential decay function .",
