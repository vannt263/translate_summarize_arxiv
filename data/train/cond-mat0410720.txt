    "orbital compass models offer a simple and qualitative description of the ordering of orbital degrees of freedom in a number of complex oxides such as the titanates @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom of these models describe the spatial orientation of the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "jahn - teller effects lead to anisotropic orbital compass like interactions amongst the orbitals . when combined with the spin degrees of freedom , to which the orbitals are coupled via super - exchange in these systems @xcite as well as by spin - orbit interactions , they lead to complex phase diagrams with phases that involve both spin and orbital ordering ( and disorder ) to various degrees .",
    "indeed , these systems offer an interesting laboratory for the study of interesting anisotropic quantum nematic phases , with and without spin order , and are a simple example of electronic liquid crystal phases @xcite .",
    "orbital compass models also exhibit unusual and so far not well studied symmetries which play a big role in their physical properties . in the current article , we elucidate the discrete  sliding \" gauge - like symmetries present in the two and three dimensional orbital compass models . in two dimensions ,",
    "these symmetries involve flipping the orbital degrees of freedom simultaneously along a single row or column of the lattice .",
    "these discrete symmetry transformations stand in - between the global symmetries familiar from spin systems and the local symmetries of gauge theories .",
    "although these are not truly gauge symmetries in the sense that they affect the boundary conditions , they are softer than the familiar global symmetries .",
    "in fact , for reasons discussed elsewhere @xcite these discrete sliding symmetries are alike gauge symmetries in that they can not be spontaneously broken .",
    "a direct consequence of the existence of these discrete sliding symmetries is that their natural order parameters are _ nematic _ , which are invariant under discrete sliding symmetries .",
    "here we give an explicit construction of the nematic order parameters and potential physical consequences are discussed .",
    "gauge - like symmetries appear in a number of condensed matter systems .",
    "exact local gauge symmetries are pervasive in the quantum hydrodynamics of incompressible and compressible quantum hall systems , as a direct expression of their quantum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "similarly , local gauge symmetries appear naturally in the context of strongly correlated systems such as the @xmath3 model , quantum dimer models , and other systems @xcite .",
    "of particular interest for the problems discussed in this paper are the _ sliding phases _ of arrays of luttinger liquids @xcite , quantum hall smectic ( stripe ) phases @xcite , dna intercalates in lipid bilayers @xcite , as well as in some ring exchange models of frustrated antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the discrete sliding symmetries we discuss here are a discrete , @xmath4 , version of the _ continuous _ sliding symmetries of the systems mentioned above .",
    "the existence of sliding symmetries has profound effects on their quantum phase transitions , whose behavior only begun to be understood quite recently @xcite and still remains largely unexplored .    amongst others , discrete sliding symmetries",
    "are present in spin @xcite , orbital @xcite , and superconducting array systems @xcite .",
    "we further demonstrate that the planar orbital compass model @xcite and the xu - moore model @xcite of two dimensional @xmath1 superconducting arrays are , in fact , one and the same system , related by a simple duality transformation .",
    "viewed in that light , the discrete sliding symmetries which the hamiltonians describing superconducting arrays display are natural . by applying our new dualities",
    ", we find self - dualities for the three dimensional orbital compass model and several other systems .",
    "these dualities do not rely on operator representations @xcite ,",
    "@xcite nor on standard combinatorial loop / bond counting arguments or summation formulas @xcite .",
    "rather , the new dualities that we report here appear as simple geometrical reflections between various spin and spatial axis .",
    "the dualities investigated in this paper map such trivial geometrical reflection self - dualities in one model onto far less trivial weak - strong coupling self - dualities in other systems . in a formal setting , our dualities correspond to different space - time cuts of a single classical action . choosing a certain time and spin quantization axis",
    ", we find one spatial system whilst choosing the time axis to lie along another direction in space - time leads to a seemingly very different ( yet dual ) spatial model .",
    "our new , purely geometric , dualities further extend and complement , from a rather general perspective , the dualities generally derived via techniques such as those in , e.g. , @xcite .    the plan to the paper is as follows . in section [ qp ]",
    ", we introduce the planar orbital compass model in both its isotropic and anisotropic incarnations .",
    "we identify the many gauge like and single reflection symmetries of this model ( the latter reflection symmetry will , as we will later find out , play the role of self - duality ) . in the aftermath , we construct order parameters invariant under these symmetries .    in section [ pps ] , we discuss another two dimensional xy system that possesses one dimensional gauge like symmetries .",
    "this system has been argued to embody the quintessential physics of a square lattice array of @xmath1 superconducting grains .",
    "as we will show , this model is identical to the planar orbital compass model .    in section [ tdo ]",
    ", we discuss the three dimensional orbital compass system .",
    "this model has been considered to embody the prototypical features of orbital system hamiltonian and might be directly relevant to the so - called `` @xmath5 '' systems ( such as the vanadates and manganates ) in particular .",
    "we identify gauge like symmetries in this system . as in the planar case",
    ", we find nematic orders invariant the gauge like symmetries .",
    "this in turn suggests that orbital systems might possess observable nematic orders .    in section [ mc ]",
    ", we employ simple geometrical reflections to derive dualities for extended systems ( now residing in three dimensions ) .",
    "the dualities of xu and moore @xcite ( derived by kramers - wannier loop counting ) form a subset of the derived dualities .",
    "the central actor in our scheme is a geometrical inversion operator which allows us to set the imaginary time axis along different external space - time directions with similar ideas for choosing the internal spin quantization axis .",
    "these operations generate , in turn , many different dual models .",
    "with this geometrical understanding of the observed duality in hand , we return to the self - dual point of @xcite and make comparisons to other systems .    in section [ sec : operator ]",
    ", we use an operator representation of the duality transformation to rederive the dualities for the orbital compass model which we obtained via geometrical reflections in the previous sections .",
    "section [ conc ] is devoted to the conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ cube ] we discuss the self - duality of  around the cube \" models in transverse fields .",
    "we start with the planar compass - model .",
    "the compass models often serve as the simplest caricatures for the physics of 3d orbital systems wherein jahn - teller interactions as well as magnetic exchange processes are dictated by the orientation of the orbitals at the various lattice sites . in the orbital compass models , the spin variables code for the orbital states .",
    "as orbitals extend in real space , all orbital dependent interactions are highly anisotropic- these interactions link the external lattice directions with the internal `` spin '' ( i.e. orbital ) orientations .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite where the physics of orbital systems and the orbital only models that we investigate is explored in depth .",
    "the planar compass model is defined on the square lattice where at each site  @xmath6 there is a s=1/2 operator denoted by  @xmath7 .",
    "the isotropic planar orbital model hamiltonian @xmath8 where the nature of the interaction allows us to set @xmath9 @xcite .    unlike the more conventional nearest neighbor spin hamiltonians which posses a continuous global rotational symmetry , the compass model hamiltonian is not invariant under arbitrary global rotations of all spins .",
    "[ physically , the lack of this symmetry is the direct consequence of the coupling between the internal polarization directions ( orbital states ) and the external lattice directions ( as much unlike spins , the orbitals extend in real space ) @xcite .",
    "] instead , this model possesses many new non - trivial symmetries corresponding to specific quantized angles of rotation of all spins on given rows / columns and a single additional rather trivial reflection symmetry ( which upon mapping will enable us to find a non - trivial weak to strong coupling self - duality in another model ) . as a consequence of these symmetries ,",
    "this model harbors an infinite degeneracy of all states and of its ground states in particular .",
    "let us consider the system with open boundary conditions on an @xmath10 square lattice and let us define an operator on an arbitrary horizontal line ( of ordinate z ) @xmath11 and an operator on an arbitrary vertical line ( of horizontal intercept x ) @xmath12 .",
    "it is readily verified that for all sites @xmath13 whose z component is @xmath14 , the product @xmath15 while @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , @xmath17 inverts the z component of all spins on a vertical line , while leaving @xmath18 untouched . in the case of symmetric exchange constants for bonds along the x and z axis , as in the compass model under consideration here , ( where both exchange constants are equal to @xmath19 ) , we further have a single additional @xmath4 reflection symmetry ( @xmath20 , @xmath21)- a rotation by @xmath22 about the symmetric line ( the 45 degree line in the xz plane ) , i.e. @xmath23 $ ] . for each of these operations , @xmath24 .",
    "this symmetry , @xmath25 is a manifestation of self - duality present in the model- we will explain the origin of this comment later .",
    "putting all of the pieces together , as a consequence of these symmetries , each state is , at least , @xmath26 degenerate .",
    "formally , these symmetries constitute a gauge like symmetry which is intermediate between a local gauge symmetry ( whose volume scales as the system area ) and a global gauge symmetry ( whose logarithmic volume is point - like ) .",
    "these intermediate gauge symmetries suggest that non - trivialities may occur .",
    "as it turns out , such large discrete symmetries do not prohibit ordering in classical variants of this model albeit complicating matters significantly @xcite .",
    "this ordering tendency may be expected to become fortified by quantum fluctuations ( `` quantum order out of disorder '' ) @xcite .    as an aside",
    ", we note that the global nematic symmetries ( the global rotation of all spins by @xmath27 with @xmath28 ) are not independent symmetries on top of the gauge like symmetries discussed above .",
    "rather , there is only one ( @xmath29 , @xmath21)- a rotation by @xmath22 about the symmetric line ( the 45 degree line in the xz plane ) ) additional symmetry supplanting the gauge like symmetries . to see this",
    ", first note that the global inversion operation , @xmath30 , is a composite of the row / column inversion symmetries : an inversion of @xmath18 on all rows followed by an inversion of @xmath31 on all columns leads to the global inversion operation .",
    "next , note that by fusing the global inversion symmetry with the global @xmath4 reflection symmetry , we may produce the four global nematic symmetry operations ( rotations by @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , unlike what is suggested by @xcite , the global nematic symmetries do not supplant the gauge - like symmetries and no less important , the quantum system possesses the above reported gauge like symmetries embodied by the operators @xmath32 .",
    "the classical ( large @xmath33 ) ground state sector of the orbital compass model further possesses an additional continuous ( @xmath34 ) symmetry not captured by the discrete @xmath35 symmetries ( @xmath36 of these associated with horizontal , @xmath36 associated with vertical discrete spin flip symmetries , and one @xmath4 symmetry being the ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) reflection symmetry ) detailed above .",
    "this continuous symmetry is made evident by noting that any constant spin - field , @xmath37 , is a ground state .",
    "first , we note that @xmath38 ^ 2 $ ] is constant .",
    "thus , up to an irrelevant constant , the general hamiltonian of eq .",
    "is @xmath39 which is obviously minimized when the spin field is constant .",
    "we emphasize that the continuous symmetries which underscore these ground states are just symmetries of the states and _ not _ of the hamiltonian itself . in common parlance , these are _ emergent symmetries _ specific only to the ground state sector .",
    "therefore , at least in the orbital - only models , we are not in a setting where a mermin - wagner argument can be applied .    with an eye towards things to come , let us now introduce and examine the anisotropic planar compass model , @xmath40    it is readily verified that this more general hamiltonian harbors all of the one dimensional gauge like symmetries encapsulated by @xmath32 .",
    "the only symmetry which does not persist for arbitrary @xmath41 is the reflection symmetry .",
    "[ insofar as its underlying physics is concerned , this anisotropic compass model emulates jahn - teller distortions on a strained lattice @xcite . ]    the two terms in the anisotropic compass model of eq.([an2d ] ) , trivially compete .",
    "the first term favors ordering of the spins parallel to the x axis while the second favors an ordering of the spins parallel to the z - axis .",
    "order becomes more inhibited when the competition between the two terms becomes the strongest ( @xmath42 ) as it indeed occurs within the compass model of eq.([hcompass ] ) .",
    "we note that the gauge like symmetries ( encapsulated by the column / row @xmath32 generators ) preserve the hamiltonian also for arbitrary @xmath43 . a natural ( smectic - like ) order parameter in the orbital compass model monitors the tendency of the spins to order along their preferred directions @xmath44 ( just as in smectic liquid crystals , having all spins point in the @xmath45 direction or in the ( @xmath46 ) direction is one and the same insofar as the above order parameter is concerned ) .",
    "this nematic like order parameter is invariant under all gauge like symmetries .",

    "the discrete ( gauge - like ) sliding symmetry of this model is similar to that of the planar orbital compass model and we will indeed show that these two models are actually dual to each other . the central derivation in @xcite was a self - duality of the hamiltonian in eq.([xm ] ) via a tour de force wannier kramers loop counting arguments .",
    "the form of this self - duality is somewhat similar ( yet still very different ) to the beautiful self - dualities of @xcite .",
    "similar dualties were discussed in the ring exchange systems of @xcite . in these models not only a relation amongst strong and weak coupling is given by the self - duality but the self - duality further intertwines the various terms ( e.g. large @xmath65 is related to small @xmath66 in the self - duality of eq.([xm ] ) and vice versa as found by xu and moore ) .",
    "we will shortly establish that the rather complicated looking weak coupling to strong coupling self - duality of eq.([xm ] ) derived by @xcite immediately follows from a very simple purely geometric ( @xmath2 reflection ) self - duality of the planar orbital compass model .",
