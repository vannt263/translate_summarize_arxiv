    "the magnetic field positions of the observed lmpr and slmpr minima and maxima features are compared with the values predicted by @xmath53 calculations and equations [ eqn : mpr ] and [ eqn : polyanovskii ] in figure [ fig : slmpr ] .",
    "the @xmath53 predicted magnetic field value for the mpr condition falls with increasing @xmath5 due to the decrease in the superlattice band gap , which causes the effective mass to decrease .",
    "we observe that resistivity maxima ( @xmath47 minima ) occur at fields slightly above the conventional mpr resonance position .",
    "the experimentally observed resistivity minima labelled as @xmath52 lmpr are typically seen when @xmath64 in good agreement with bulk lmpr resonances@xcite . by contrast",
    "the slmpr features move up in field due to the increased contribution from @xmath5 in equation [ eqn : polyanovskii ] and show excellent agreement with the predicted slmpr positions when account is taken of the magnetic field dependence of the miniband width .",
    "as the miniband width increases we expect a continuous transition to conventional bulk magnetophonon behavior once @xmath65 since the superlattices may be considered to act as a bulk 3-dimensional system if all thermal and cyclotron excitations are much smaller than the superlattice miniband width      within this regime electrons are unable to probe the upper portion of the superlattice miniband and carriers only experience a dispersion similar to the parabolic bulk case .",
    "it would therefore be expected that such samples display no slmpr features .",
    "@xmath53 calculation results for samples 3756 and 4520 indicate that if observed the slmpr would be located at @xmath67 t and @xmath68 t respectively . in experiment ( figure [ fig : allplots ] ) both exhibit resistance minima features at around @xmath69 t which correspond well with the predicted @xmath70 mpr resonances which is also particularly strong in the longitudinal configuration for bulk materials@xcite suggesting that the transition to bulk behavior has occurred for these structures .",
    "this will be discussed further later in this report .",
    "the physical origins of the lmpr and slmpr features in low miniband width samples ( @xmath71 ) can be understood by considering the lo phonon absorption / emission processes which are allowed for different @xmath14 values , as shown in figure [ fig : slmprv2 ] .",
    "inter - miniband lo phonon scattering between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 llmb s is only permitted in the range @xmath74 due to the forbidden energy gaps in the system .",
    "note also that the miniband width of any given llmb has a significant magnetic field dependence ( @xmath24 ) further complicating this schematic picture .",
    "transitions for which final or initial states are at @xmath75 and/or the mini - brillouin zone boundary @xmath76 have high scattering rates due to the large density of states at these @xmath77 .",
    "we can consider the scattering of electrons in the positive @xmath77 region of the @xmath72 llmb dispersion which contribute to the transport current .",
    "it is clear that lo phonon absorption transitions will result in final states at @xmath78 and @xmath79 such that the average velocity of a final state is zero .",
    "the average of lo phonon scattering events therefore relaxes the electron momentum and the resistance will be proportional to scattering rate . the scattering rate will increase approaching the mpr condition as lo phonon scattering is allowed over a greater proportion of the dispersion . at the mpr condition the lo phonon scattering rate is at its greatest . if @xmath80 scattering will be allowed anywhere within the superlattice dispersion . in reality",
    "@xmath81 for the inas / gasb system restricting scattering at the mini - brillouin zone boundary .    above the mpr condition the scattering rate",
    "is reduced with increasing b - field as lo phonon transitions from the center of the superlattice dispersion are increasingly forbidden . at the slmpr condition ( @xmath82 ) only scattering from @xmath76 in the @xmath72 llmb to @xmath75 in the @xmath73 llmb",
    "is allowed .",
    "the relaxation therefore links two high density of states regions of the dispersion relation resulting once again in a high scattering rate .        for superlattice miniband transport , however , the current flow is dependent on more than simply the immediate scattering rate .",
    "the contribution to current flow also depends on the subsequent ballistic motion in k - space under electric field acceleration , since the velocity is strongly dependent upon where the carrier is in the dispersion relation .",
    "these factors must be considered to fully understand the form of mpr features .",
    "we consider the relative effects of acceleration of carriers in initial and final scattered states to determine the effect of the scattering upon transport current .",
    "acceleration in an electric field following lo phonon scattering has the effect of decreasing drift velocity below the mpr condition since the carrier velocity is increasing with @xmath83 in the lower landau level and decreasing with @xmath83 in the upper level ( figure [ fig : slmprv2](b ) ) .",
    "conversely the drift velocity increases above the mpr condition . at the mpr condition",
    "final and initial states are comparable such that subsequent acceleration does not alter the total transport current . scattering at the slmpr condition has the most dramatic and significant consequence that it prevents the occurrence of bragg scattering and the subsequent suppression of transport current due to cycling of the carriers through the negative drift velocity section of the dispersion relation . above @xmath84 the coupling of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 llmbs through lo phonon scattering is removed and intra - llmb scattering dominates .",
    "this reverses carrier momentum and quenches transport@xcite resulting in a significant increase in resistance following the slmpr feature .",
    "the characteristics of the lmpr and slmpr features are therefore determined by interplay of the scattering rate and the subsequent ballistic motion of the transport electrons .",
    "this simple analysis indicates that lmpr is likely to appear as a resistance maximum at the mpr condition due to the high scattering rate and slmpr as a resistance minimum followed by a large increase in resistance .    in order to understand the different contributions to the magnetoresistance , modelling of the experimental results",
    "was therefore performed using semiclassical monte carlo simulations of the miniband transport , assuming that the effects of wannier - stark localisation are not significant .",
    "simulations follow the method outlined by henriques _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "limited inelastic acoustic phonon scattering in an energy window of 1mev ( selected to be less than @xmath5 ) was introduced to ensure that the conductivity at high @xmath18-fields is small but non - zero .",
    "it is found that changing this window significantly alters the background magnetoresistance but that the lmpr and slmpr features remain .",
    "simulation results are displayed for superlattice band structures approximating to that of samples 4561 , 4579 and 3756 in figure [ fig : andre2 ] .",
    "the landau miniband energy widths have been approximated with the function @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are parameters obtained from fits to the results of @xmath53 simulations .",
    "both samples are simulated with @xmath88k and electric field @xmath89 such that results are close to the ohmic miniband transport regime but show some ballistic behavior .",
    "the simulation results for low miniband widths ( figure [ fig : andre2 ] ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) ) display two clear features : firstly , there is a pronounced minimum in the drift velocity ( corresponding to a resistivity maximum ) at the conventional mpr condition and secondly there are peaks in drift velocity at the slmpr conditions .",
    "these results show excellent agreement with the schematic picture previously discussed .",
    "the simulations identify that the magnetotransport is dependent on both the scattering rate and the positions on the dispersion curves of the initial and final states .",
    "resistance maxima at the mpr are caused by the increased scattering rate .",
    "the resistance minima at the slmpr are formed from the relative effects of electric field acceleration in the initial and final scattering states .",
    "similar simulation results are observed for other samples which show that the position of the slmpr feature is well described by equation [ eqn : polyanovskii ] , shifting progressively away from the lmpr feature with increasing miniband width .",
    "the simulation results change significantly when the miniband width becomes large ( @xmath65 ) as observed for sample 3756 , figure [ fig : andre2 ] ( _ c _ ) .",
    "we observe that resistivity minima now occur at the @xmath52 and @xmath70 mpr conditions .",
    "this is in good agreement with the bulk approximation in which the lmpr is observed as a resistivity minimum slightly below the mpr condition@xcite . for sample 3756 the @xmath90 mpr feature",
    "is particularly enhanced by proximity to the slmpr condition .",
    "the slmpr feature is however suppressed above the @xmath90 mpr condition due to efficient intra - miniband lo phonon emissions .",
    "our overall conclusion therefore is that the modelling provides strong support for the attribution of the high field resistivity minimum to the predicted slmpr feature and that this is strongly supported by the clear dependence of the slmpr position on miniband width .",
    "by contrast , the attribution of a maximum or minimum in resistance to the precise mpr condition is not found to hold experimentally .",
    "the stronger feature is found to be a maximum at fields a few percent above the mpr condition .",
    "a resistivity minimum is found in all samples slightly below the mpr condition , in an analogous behavior to that seen in bulk material .",
    "the non - observation of the slmpr feature in the earlier gaalas based work is probably due to the complications caused by the presence of the two phonon modes and the relatively small range of miniband widths studied .",
    "in summary we have demonstrated a new form of magnetophonon resonance which occurs due to the scattering of carriers from the top of the ground state miniband to the bottom of the next llmb . this new resonance known as superlattice mpr ( slmpr )",
    "was first predicted by polyanovskii in 1983 .",
    "the resonance condition corresponds to taking carriers from the top of the miniband dispersion where they will have a negative differential velocity and moving them to the bottom of the band where they can be recycled through the positive conduction regime .",
