    "diffraction gratings are not only exploited by nature for the production of color @xcite but have also been extensively used in optics for several centuries @xcite . during the last century , tremendous progress in manufacturing techniques made diffraction gratings as the spectral dispersive elements of choice .",
    "spectacular progress was also made on the numerical solution of the time ",
    "harmonic maxwell equations for diffraction gratings , thereby greatly facilitating analysis and design @xcite . given such remarkable developments , one would think that the last word on diffraction gratings is imminent ; but the emergence of isotropic dielectric  magnetic materials exhibiting phase velocity vector opposed in direction to the time  averaged poynting vector @xcite-@xcite has opened new prospects for diffraction gratings .",
    "typically , a diffraction grating is a slab of either a metal or a dielectric material whose exposed surface is periodically corrugated . when a plane wave is incident on this surface , it is reflected partially in the specular direction fixed by snel s law @xcite and partially in nonspecular directions fixed by the periodicity of the corrugated surface in relation to the free  space wavelength . in addition , specular as well as nonspecular refraction into the slab may also occur , depending on the type of material .",
    "finally , reflections from the back surface also contribute to the overall reflection from the grating , but those need not be considered when examining the essence of the phenomenon of diffraction . as the angle of incidence is changed , specular as well as nonspecular components of the reflected field wax and wane , which phenomenon is technologically exploitable .    what would happen if a diffraction grating were to be made of an isotropic dielectric  magnetic material",
    "? if the phase velocity and the time  averaged poynting vectors in this material are co  parallel , then the effects are not qualitatively different from a diffraction grating made of simply an isotropic dielectric material @xcite , while the quantitative differences are due to differences in the relative impedance and the wavenumber inside the diffracting material @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the case when the phase velocity and the time  averaged poynting vectors in the diffracting material are oppositely directed .",
    "though several names have been proposed for this class of materials , we think that the most descriptive is : negative phase ",
    "velocity ( npv ) materials .",
    "in contrast , the phase velocity and the time  averaged poynting vectors are co  parallel in positive phase ",
    "velocity ( ppv ) materials .",
    "ppv materials are , of course , commonplace .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : the boundary value problem of a diffraction grating is presented in section ii , with careful delineation of field characteristics in the refracting half  space .",
    "three methods of solving the boundary value problem are extended in section iii to encompass npv refracting materials .",
    "these methods are : ( i ) the rayleigh  hypothesis method , ( ii ) perturbative approach , and ( iii ) the c formalism .",
    "numerical results for corrugations of both symmetric as well as asymmetric shapes are presented in section iv , and the effects of replacing a ppv material by its npv analog , or _ vice versa _ , are extracted from those results . an @xmath0 time ",
    "dependence is implicit , with @xmath1 , @xmath2 as the angular frequency , and @xmath3 as the time .",
    "in a rectangular coordinate system @xmath4 , we consider the periodically corrugated boundary @xmath5 between vacuum and a homogeneous , isotropic , linear , passive , dielectric  magnetic material , with @xmath6 being the corrugation period .",
    "the region @xmath7 is vacuous , whereas the material occupying the region @xmath8 is characterized by complex  valued scalars @xmath9 and @xmath10 that depend on @xmath2 .",
    "if this medium is of the npv type , then the following three conditions hold equivalently @xcite : @xmath11 \\epsilon_{2r}\\mu_{2i } + \\epsilon_{2i}\\mu_{2r}<0\\\\[5pt ] \\epsilon_{2r } |\\mu_2| + \\mu_{2r } |\\epsilon_2| < 0 \\end{array}\\right\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{conditrad2}\\ ] ] none of the three conditions hold for a ppv material .",
    "a linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave is incident on this boundary from the region @xmath7 at an angle @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with respect to the @xmath14 axis , as shown in figure [ geomfig ] .",
    "this plane wave can be either @xmath15polarized or @xmath16polarized @xcite .",
    "given the orientation of the plane wave with respect to the grating plane ( i.e. , the @xmath17 plane ) , all reflected and transmitted fields must be linearly polarized in the same way as the incident plane wave @xcite .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in the foregoing sections , we extended rayleigh s own method , a perturbative approach , and the c formalism to encompass diffraction by surface ",
    "relief gratings made of made of isotropic , negative phase  velocity materials .",
    "this was enabled by carefully representing the field inside the refracting material .",
    "numerical results for corrugations of both symmetric as well as asymmetric shapes were obtained , as also for both @xmath15 and @xmath16polarized incident plane waves .",
    "we concluded that replacement of a ppv grating by its npv analog affects only nonspecular diffraction efficiencies when the corrugations are shallow .",
    "when the corrugations deepen , the specular diffraction efficiencies are also affected by the type of the refracting material .",
    "surface wave propagation as well as the resonant excitation of surface waves also depends on whether the refracting material is of the npv type or its ppv analog .",
    "excitation of a surface wave through a grating plays a fundamental role when high selectivity is desired . in common ppv gratings ,",
    "surface waves have been exploited for efficient conversion of @xmath16 to @xmath15 polarizations , or _",
    "vice versa _ in conical mountings as well as to obtain enhanced nonlinear optical effects through the enhancement of surface fields usually associated with the resonant excitation of surface polaritons @xcite .",
    "surface waves play an important role in the concept of a perfect lens realized using a npv material , since the field of an image , which can not be focused by a normal lens , can be transferred through a npv layer by the excitation of surface waves at both of its boundaries @xcite .",
    "we expect that npv slabs with periodically corrugated boundaries combine both attributes",
