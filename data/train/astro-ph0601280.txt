    "faint fuzzy star clusters are peculiar star cluster populations which are large ( @xmath2 pc ) , faint ( @xmath6 ) , and red ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "they are much larger than typical galactic globular clusters , but are as red as old globular clusters .",
    "these star clusters were introduced as a new family of star clusters by @xcite in their study of the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 1023 .",
    "although extensive searches over four early - type galaxies ( three s0 s and one e ) were made by @xcite , these clusters were found only in two sb0 galaxies ngc 1023 ( sb0 ) and ngc 3384 ( sb0 ) , and were not found in ngc 3115 ( s0 ) and ngc 3379 ( e1 ) .",
    "the main characteristics of these clusters derived from the imaging and spectroscopic studies @xcite are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) they are larger than normal old globular clusters .",
    "their effective radii range from 7 to 15 pc , while the effective radii of typical globular clusters in our galaxy are 23 pc ; ( 2 ) they are faint .",
    "most of them are fainter than @xmath7 mag ; ( 3 ) they are associated with disks of their host galaxies , showing a systematic rotation similar to the rotation of the disk ; ( 4 ) those in ngc 1023 are moderately metal - rich with [ fe / h]@xmath8 dex , and are @xmath9 element - enriched with [ @xmath9/fe]@xmath10 dex ; and ( 5 ) those in ngc 1023 are older than 78 gyr ; ( 6 ) their origin is regarded to be associated with the interaction of host galaxies with their neighbors .    during this study",
    ", @xcite reported that 12 early - type galaxies in virgo cluster harbor a significant number of diffuse star clusters , and that nine of them are s0s .",
    "these clusters have low luminosities ( @xmath7 ) , a broad spectrum of size ( @xmath11 pc ) , and a broad range of color ( @xmath12 ) , and they are predominantly red with @xmath13 .",
    "these clusters are mainly characterized by the @xmath14-band low surface brightness @xmath15 mag arcsec@xmath16 .",
    "the red population of these diffuse star clusters shares common features with faint fuzzy clusters , and faint fuzzy clusters are considered to be a subset of the diffuse star clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of a dozen of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 5195 , which made this galaxy the third known sb0 galaxy inhabited by this rare family of star clusters .",
    "however , due to the limited spatial coverage and filters ( @xmath17 ) of the @xmath0 wfpc2 data they used , details of these clusters remain to be known : how many such clusters exist in ngc 5195 ?",
    "how wide are they distributed ?",
    "how old are they ?    in the course of our study of star clusters in the m51 system , we have used @xmath0 acs mosaic images of ngc 5195 to get the answers to the above questions . in this letter , we report a spatial distribution of these faint fuzzy star clusters in ngc 5195 .",
    "the data used in this study were obtained by the hubble heritage team using @xmath0 acs with f435w(b ) , f555w(v ) , f814w(i ) , and f658n(h@xmath9 ) filters through @xmath0 observing program 10452 ( p.i .",
    ": steven v. w. beckwith ) to commemorate the @xmath0 s 15th anniversary .",
    "all the necessary data reduction processes were done by the stsci including multi - drizzling for image combination before public release of the data .",
    "details of the data reduction are given in @xcite and their website ( http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/m51/ ) .",
    "we adopt a distance to ngc 5195 of @xmath18 mpc ( @xmath19 ) , determined from the planetary nebula luminosity function in m51 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding linear scale is 40.7 parsecs per arcsecond .",
    "the @xmath0 acs mosaic data have pixel sizes of @xmath20 after the multi - drizzle process .",
    "the foreground reddening toward ngc 5195 is low , @xmath21 ( corresponding extinctions are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 mag ) @xcite .",
    "the total magnitudes and colors of ngc 5195 are @xmath25 mag , @xmath26 @xcite . for the adopted distance",
    "its absolute magnitudes are @xmath27 mag and @xmath28 mag , respectively .",
    "at the distance of ngc 5195 , typical stellar clusters will appear somewhat more extended than stars in the @xmath0 acs images .",
    "we made use of this information in radial profiles of detected objects , plus other morphological criteria , in order to separate clusters from stars and background galaxies .",
    "details of the source detection , photometry , and star cluster selection processes are given in @xcite , and only a brief description is presented here .    in order to identify star clusters using morphological information , we utilized sextractor @xcite , a program which builds catalogs of objects from astronomical images and provides morphological information as well .",
    "this routine provides a number of morphological parameters which are very useful for separating star clusters from the majority of stars and background galaxies .",
    "first , we identified all objects in the @xmath29 band images using sextractor .",
    "a detection threshold of @xmath30 was used for finding objects in the images .",
    "secondly , we made a sample of star cluster candidates brighter than @xmath31 mag using the morphological parameters provided by sextractor .",
    "finally we selected star clusters by visual inspection of the images of these candidates .",
    "we divided the clusters into two classes : class 1 for clusters with normal circular morphology , and class 2 for clusters with asymmetric morphology .",
    "the number of star clusters we have found in the region of @xmath32 around ngc 5195 is 283 ( 246 for class 1 and 37 for class 2 ) .",
    "we used only class 1 clusters in this study .",
    "we estimated the effective radii of these clusters using ishape provided by @xcite .",
    "for the point spread function ( psf ) required for ishape , we constructed an empirical psf by carefully selecting isolated stars scattered evenly in the neighborhood of ngc 5195 .",
    "variation of the psf profile shape is found to be not significant , if any , around ngc 5195 field .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of all the measured star clusters in the @xmath32 field around ngc 5195 .",
    "one remarkable feature seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that red clusters are , on average , quite larger than blue clusters .",
    "we plot the effective radii vs. @xmath33 color of the clusters in fig .",
    "2 . the dashed line in fig . 2 marks the effective radius @xmath34 of 7 pc used by @xcite to separate out extended , faint fuzzies from more typical , compact globular clusters . fig .",
    "2 shows that there are a significant number of large red clusters with @xmath3 . the second feature in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that extended clusters ( marked by filled circles ) are concentrated in a small range of colors .",
    "we consider the star clusters with @xmath35 pc and residing in both @xmath36 and @xmath37 color domain to be faint fuzzy clusters .",
    "about 45 % ( 49 out of 109 ) red clusters are found to be faint fuzzy star clusters and all the faint fuzzy clusters discovered by @xcite were confirmed .",
    "it should be noted that , however , our criteria to select faint fuzzy clusters are phenomenological , just following @xcite .    we have derived age and mass of these clusters by fitting the @xmath1 photometry of the clusters with the spectral energy distribution in the simple stellar population models of @xcite .",
    "we adopted the solar metallicity ( @xmath38 ) , following @xcite .",
    "the derived ages of clusters range from 1.2 to 13.2 gyr .",
    "the range of ages will be 1.0  3.4 gyr for z=0.05 , and 2.4  19.1 gyr for z=0.008 , respectively .",
    "the cluster masses are estimated to be @xmath39 ",
    "@xmath40 for z=0.02 , @xmath41 ",
    "@xmath42 for z=0.05 , and @xmath43 ",
    "@xmath44 for z=0.008 .",
    "this shows that these clusters are indeed older than 1 gyr and as massive as @xmath45  @xmath46 .",
    "we display the spatial distribution of faint fuzzy star clusters of ngc 5195 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : filled circles for bright clusters with @xmath47 and open circles for faint clusters with @xmath48 .",
    "the magnitude cut of @xmath49 is adopted to reduce any possible contamination due to background galaxies .",
    "of all the 17 galaxies with @xmath50 mag identified in the ngc 5195 field , five galaxies are found to be larger than @xmath51 pc and to belong to the color - magnitude parameter spaces of faint fuzzy clusters . among those galaxies , three galaxies with @xmath47",
    "are found to show either very extended surface brightness profiles or evident non - circular morphologies .",
    "this makes the distinction between galaxies and faint fuzzy clusters quite robust for the candidates brighter than @xmath49 mag .",
    "therefore , faint fuzzy clusters with @xmath47 are considered to be a safe sample with negligible background galaxy contamination .",
    "several striking features are seen in fig .",
    "first , faint fuzzy clusters are not distributed uniformly around the center of ngc 5195 . instead , most of these clusters appear to be located in an elongated region almost perpendicular to the northern spiral arm of ngc 5194 , while some clusters are scattered out of this area . on the other hand ,",
    "compact red clusters in the lower panel show quite a different distribution : most of them are distributed around the bright optical main body of ngc 5195 .",
    "secondly , most blue star clusters with @xmath52 are composing a remarkably narrow sequence along the northern spiral arm of ngc 5194 passing through the eastern part of ngc 5195 . a few blue clusters that are located in the southern area of ngc 5195 are considered to be members of ngc 5194 .",
    "third , comparison with the distribution of planetary nebulae of m51 system @xcite shows some common points with that of faint fuzzy clusters , especially in the western halo of ngc 5195 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the complex kinematics of the planetary nebulae in this region may be due to tidal interaction in the m51 system .",
    "therefore it appears that some faint fuzzy clusters in this region may also belong to tidal debris .",
    "fourth , although the faint fuzzy cluster system of ngc 5195 shows an elongated structure , it is not clear whether these clusters are distributed along a ring - like geometry , as in the case of the faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 1023 @xcite .",
    "fifth , considering the theoretical evolutionary model fitting results that the faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 5195 are older than 1 gyr , the difference in the spatial distribution between the faint fuzzy clusters and blue young clusters can be attributed to the different formation epochs and environments : the faint fuzzy clusters were formed around ngc 5195 before the interactions with ngc 5194 , while the young clusters are the results of the induced star formation triggered by the interaction that took place about 100 @xmath53 500 myr ago @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that faint fuzzy clusters were found in only two late - type sb0 galaxies , ngc 1023 and ngc 3384 , among four early type galaxies investigated .",
    "various observations that found several features of interaction in ngc 1023 @xcite and ngc 3384 @xcite suggest that the formation of faint fuzzy clusters in these galaxies are maybe related to the interaction of their host galaxies with neighbors @xcite .",
    "this is supported by theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that only two of the galaxies hosting diffuse star clusters have nearby neighbor galaxies .",
    "we found from an inspection of the poss maps and the data in ned of their sample that 40% of 10 bright galaxies with @xmath54 show hints of interaction ( e.g. , existence of neighbor galaxies , asymmetric outer halo ) and 60% of them are sb0 or sab0 .",
    "diffuse star clusters in bright galaxies ( @xmath54 ) are found either in sb0s or in interacting galaxies .",
    "the only exception is vcc 1720 ( sa ) , which happens to be the faintest among the bright sample ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore , major interaction of the host galaxy with its companions or the existence of a bar appears to be a key to the understanding of the origin of faint fuzzy clusters and diffuse star clusters in these galaxies .",
    "ngc 5195 is also a peculiar sb0 galaxy interacting with another barred spiral galaxy ngc 5194 which is two or three times more massive than ngc 5195 @xcite .",
    "however , the estimated ages of the faint fuzzy clusters suggest that it is not likely that these clusters were formed during the encounter with ngc 5194 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the theoretical merging models proposed for the formation of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 1023 @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the faint fuzzy clusters might have formed during the interaction of galaxies much earlier than the age range investigated in the previous dynamical models or they might have formed via some other mechanisms .    to date , ngc 1023 is the only galaxy which has been confirmed to have a rotating disk system composed of faint fuzzy clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that diffuse star cluster populations in nine s0 galaxies in virgo cluster are both aligned with the host galaxy light and associated with galactic disks .",
    "nonetheless , the faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 5195 do not show any definite evidence in their spatial distribution supporting their association with the optical disk of ngc 5195 .",
    "the elongated distribution of the faint fuzzy clusters looks different from the bright optical body of ngc 5195 that is rather circular with ellipticity @xmath56 and inclined about @xmath57 ( north side to our direction ) @xcite .",
    "however , faint stellar light is seen in the region where the faint fuzzy clusters are found .",
    "in addition , the center of the elongated distribution of the faint fuzzy clusters is off about @xmath58 northwest from the center of ngc 5195 .",
    "hence , it is not evident whether the faint fuzzy clusters belong to the disk of ngc 5195 .",
    "what if the elongated distribution should be the revelation of any physical structure unknown ? from hi observation , ngc 5195 was found to be nearly deficient in hi gas except for the gas associated with the spiral arm of ngc 5194 touching its east side @xcite . only in the very center of ngc 5195",
    ", a high content of gases is detected from co and hcn observation by @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that the elongated structure should be very old and devoid of gas .",
    "it is also possible that the faint fuzzy clusters showing the elongated distribution as a whole may belong to the debris of tidal interactions between ngc 5194 and ngc 5195 .",
    "@xcite found 20 large globular clusters with @xmath35 pc in the four @xmath0 wfpc2 fields of ngc 5194 , much more than in other spiral galaxies in their sample .",
    "nine of these clusters are similar to faint fuzzy clusters found in ngc 5195 .",
    "this indicates that faint fuzzy clusters might be dispersed not only over ngc 5195 but also over ngc 5194 through the interactions .",
    "it is noted , however , that about a dozen faint fuzzy clusters were found in one @xmath0 wfpc2 field of ngc 5195 by @xcite , while only nine clusters were found in the four hst wfpc2 fields of ngc 5194 .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a scenario that the passage of a small companion galaxy through or near the center of a disk galaxy could result in the annular distribution of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 1023 . in m51 system ,",
    "the mass of ngc 5195 is 1/2 to 1/3 of that of ngc 5194 and the faint fuzzy clusters are not in a well - defined annular but in an elongated distribution , which is quite a different case from ngc 1023 .",
    "therefore @xcite s scenario may not be applied to the case of ngc 5195 .    in summary",
    ", we present a study of faint fuzzy clusters in ngc 5195 based on the analysis of the hst acs @xmath1 mosaic images .",
    "we found about 50 such clusters in the @xmath32 field around ngc 5195 .",
    "most of the faint fuzzy clusters appear to be distributed over an elongated region whose center is about one arcmin off from the center of ngc 5195 . while compact red clusters are located around ngc 5195 .",
    "some faint fuzzy clusters are at least regarded as parts of tidal debris produced by the interactions between ngc 5194 and ngc 5195 .",
    "spectroscopic studies are needed to investigate the age , metallicity , and kinematics of these faint fuzzy clusters and to understand their origin .",
