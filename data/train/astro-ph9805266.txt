    "in a long - term project we have followed - up spectroscopically on hot subdwarf candidates from the `` palomar - green catalogue of ultraviolet excess stellar objects '' ( green et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "while most objects turned out to be hot subluminous stars ( moehler et al .",
    ", @xcite , theissen et al . , @xcite ) or blue horizontal branch stars ( schmidt et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) a few candidates showed surface gravities too low for such stars and more typical for giant stars .",
    "in addition these objects exhibit normal helium line strengths , again in contrast to the usually helium weak - lined hot subdwarfs .",
    "the normality of the h / he spectrum might indicate that these stars are normal , i.e. massive giants in a strange place , very far from the galactic disk . in this case",
    "they were either created in the disk and thrown out ( cf .",
    "leonard , @xcite ) or they were born in the halo ( which could be explained by the model of the `` galactic fountain '' , dyson & hartquist , @xcite ) . on the other hand , such stars could be post - agb stars on their way from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) to the white dwarf domain that spectroscopically mimic massive stars .",
    "since this part of the evolution proceeds very fast ( 10@xmath1 years , schnberner , @xcite ) , such objects should be rather rare .",
    "indeed , not many have been found and analysed so far ( conlon et al . ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .    since a metallicity analysis offers a good possibility to distinguish between young , massive ob stars and post - agb stars we decided to get higher resolution ( about 1   ) spectra of some of these stars . here",
    "we report the results for two objects , pg1323@xmath0086  and pg1704 + 222 .",
    "lower resolution spectra of pg1704 + 222  have already been discussed by conlon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these stars we observed spectra of well known and analysed main - sequence and sub - giant ob stars to allow direct comparisons between the spectra . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and the reduction of the data .",
    "sections 3 and 4 describe the determination of atmospheric parameters and abundances .",
    "section 5 gives the kinematic data of the stars , while section 6 gives a discussion of the results .",
    "the observations and reduction of medium resolved spectra are described in moehler et al .",
    "( @xcite , pg1323@xmath0086 ) and conlon et al .",
    "( @xcite , pg1704 + 222 ) .",
    "the higher resolved data were obtained with the cassegrain twin spectrograph of the 3.5 m telescope at the calar alto observatory , using a slit - width of 2.1@xmath2 and a mean dispersion of 18   / mm in the blue and of 36   / mm in the red channel .",
    "both channels were equipped with tektronix ccds with 1024 @xmath3 1024 pixels of 24 @xmath4 m size . read - out - noise and gain were 9  e@xmath5 and 4.5  e@xmath5/adu in the blue and 8  e@xmath5 and 4.5  e@xmath5/adu in the red channel . with this setup we covered the wavelength range 3850    ",
    "4710    in the blue channel with two exposures and in the red channel we used the wavelength range 5850     6720   .",
    "the mean fwhm of the calibration lines was about 0.9    and 1.8    for the blue and red channel , respectively , and represents the typical spectral resolution of the system .",
    "the observations and data reduction were performed as described by moehler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) except that we did not use any optimal extraction algorithm , as the spectra were tilted on the ccd .",
    "instead we summed up the rows of each spectrum after sky - subtraction and tried to get rid of cosmic events by comparing several spectra of the same object .",
    "finally the spectra were corrected for the doppler shifts and coadded .",
    "the resulting mean radial velocities are listed in table  5 . to give an idea of the quality of our spectra",
    "we show part of them in fig .  1 .",
    "for both stars strmgren photometry is available from the literature ( wesemael et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which can be used in combination with the observed balmer line profiles to derive effective temperatures and surface gravities for these objects .    @xmath6  and @xmath7  were derived from the reddening - free indices [ c@xmath8 and [ u@xmath0b ] . since post - agb stars tend to show sub - solar metallicities ( see mccausland et al . , @xcite ) we used theoretical colours for metallicity @xmath01 ( napiwotzki & lemke , priv .",
    ", a recent extension of the napiwotzki et al . , @xcite , calibration to lower metallicities ) .",
    "we also fitted theoretical atlas9 balmer line profiles for metallicity @xmath01 and solar helium abundance to the h@xmath9 to h@xmath10 lines ( keeping @xmath6  fixed ) , which yielded another set of @xmath6 , @xmath7   values .",
    "the intersection of the curves shown in fig . 2 resulted in the parameters listed in table  1 .",
    "the lines are fitted very well by these models , suggesting a close to solar helium abundance .    as a cross check",
    "we also derived the physical parameters from the line profiles only , using the routines of bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and saffer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which employ a @xmath11 test .",
    "we computed model atmospheres using atlas9 ( kurucz 1991 , priv .",
    "comm . ) and used the linfor program ( developed originally by holweger , steffen , and steenbock at kiel university ) to compute a grid of theoretical spectra , which include the balmer lines h@xmath12 to h@xmath13 and lines .",
    "we fitted h@xmath14 to h@xmath10 and the lines @xmath15 4026 , 4121 , 4388 , 4437 , 4471 simultaneously .",
    "as can be seen from table  1 the values are very similar for both procedures .",
    "a third approach to derive @xmath6  is to use the / ionization equilibrium , which is applicable only to pg1323@xmath0086  and results in @xmath6=17500  k , somewhat higher than the other values .",
    "this is a well known phenomenon discussed e.g. by hambly et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who derive 21000  k for hr  6588 from the / ionization equilibrium as opposed to 17700  k from strmgren photometry .    for the further analysis we use the values derived from strmgren photometry and balmer lines ,",
    "as the temperature information is more reliably described by strmgren photometry at the low gravities involved , and keep the helium abundance fixed at @xmath16  = @xmath01.00 .",

    "pg1323@xmath0086  and pg1704 + 222  are giant stars with normal helium abundances .",
    "both stars share a characteristic abundance pattern with bd+33@xmath172642 , the central star of a halo planetary nebula , and with two high galactic latitude b - giants discussed by conlon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , most notably the strong carbon deficiency .",
    "depletions of n , o , mg , al , and si by 1 dex or more in pg1323@xmath0086  and pg1704 + 222point towards a low metallicity and , hence , membership of an old stellar population , while they are not compatible with the values found for young b stars .",
    "the positions of both stars in the ( @xmath6 , logg ) diagram are consistent with evolutionary tracks starting from the agb for masses of about 0.55  .",
    "we therefore conclude that both stars are in the post - agb stage of their evolution .",
    "the similarity of the abundance patterns to that of bd+33@xmath172642  suggests that the successors of the b - type pagb stars can be found amongst the halo cspne as already suggested by mccausland et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "potential progenitors could be found among the optically bright post - agb stars discussed by van winckel ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , van winckel finds only one star , hd107369 , for which the abundance pattern comes close to that of b - type pagb stars .",
    "the cno abundances of this star are consistent with being the product of cn cycling . in the b - type pagb stars , however , the c / n ratio can be explained by cn cycling , but not the n / o ratio .",
    "conlon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , mccausland el .",
    "( @xcite ) and napiwotzki et al . (",
    "@xcite ) discussed various scenarios to explain the abundance pattern of b - type pagb stars in terms of nuclear processing and subsequent dredge - up , but no conclusion could be reached .",
    "the high [ o / fe ] ratio ( + 1.2@xmath180.5 ) observed in bd+33@xmath172642  prompted napiwotzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to suggest that its abundance pattern could be affected by gas - dust separation invoked by bond ( @xcite ) to explain the extreme [ o / fe ]  @xmath19  4 ratio found in two peculiar pagb stars of spectral type f ( lambert et al . ,",
    "@xcite and waelkens et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the determination of the iron abundance in the b - type pagb stars is a prerequisite for an interpretation of their abundance patterns .",
