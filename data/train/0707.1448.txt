    "in our previous work  @xcite , we developed a general theory for constructing local strong solutions to nonlinear wave equations , posed on compact riemannian manifolds with supercritical random initial data .",

    "our aim is to give a proof of the following result .",

    ", we obtain global existence of strong solutions for a supercritical model , a result which seems to be completely out of reach of the present deterministic methods , even for the local existence theory .",
    "the initial data we consider can be arbitrarily large in @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , our result is _ not _ a `` small data result '' .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we analyze the hamiltonian structure of the equation and we introduce the suitable finite dimensional model which approximate ( [ 1 ] ) . in section  3 , we establish the key probabilistic estimate concerning the @xmath26 space - time norms of the free evolution . in section  4",

    "section  5 is devoted to local well - posedness results . in section  6",

    "let us first observe that thanks to the structure of ( [ ab ] ) the quantity @xmath77 is conserved under the flow of ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "therefore we may apply liouville s theorem for divergence free vector fields to obtain that the measure @xmath78 is conserved by the flow of ( [ ab ] ) .",
