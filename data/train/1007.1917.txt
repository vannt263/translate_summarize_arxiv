    "in recent years , the effort to give a physical explanation to the today observed cosmic acceleration @xcite has attracted a good amount of interest in @xmath0-gravity , where @xmath3 is a generic function of ricci scalar @xmath4 , considered as a viable mechanism to explain the cosmic acceleration by extending the geometric sector of field equations without the introduction of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "other issues , od astrophysical nature , as the observed pioneer anomaly problem @xcite can be framed into the same approach @xcite and then , apart the cosmological dynamics , a systematic analysis of such theories urges at short scale and in the low energy limit .    while it is very natural to extend the theory of general relativity ( gr ) to theories with additional geometric degrees of freedom , recent attempts focused on the old idea @xcite of modifying the gravitational lagrangian in a purely metric framework , leading to higher - order field equations . due to the increased complexity of the field equations in this framework , the main body of works dealt with some formally equivalent theories , in which a reduction of the order of the field equations was achieved by considering the metric and the connection as independent objects @xcite .",
    "in addition , other authors exploited the formal relationship to scalar - tensor theories to make some statements about the weak field regime @xcite , which was already worked out for scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "also a post - newtonian parameterization with metric approach in the jordan frame has been considered @xcite .    in this paper , we show the theory of gravity induced by a most general fourth order theory obtained by using all curvature invariants .",
    "precisely we show for a generic @xmath5-theory , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 ricci tensor and @xmath10 riemann tensor , the modifications to standard gravitational mechanics at newtonian order . from the usual _ small velocity and weak field limit approach _",
    "@xcite we find the field equations and since the differential equations are liner we obtain a general solution of metric tensor by green functions method and demonstrate that any @xmath5-theory corresponds to so - called _ quadratic lagrangian _ ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "initially the metric tensor is spherically symmetric and time depending , but in this limit the dependence is missing ( we need the post - newtonian order to fix a possible time dependence ) .",
    "so we recover also a partial outcome about the birkhoff theorem .",
    "the metric potentials have two characteristic lengths depending on the value of derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to curvature invariants and only in gr are equal .",
    "the general solutions are calculated for a point - like source and since the theory is linear , the gravitational potential can be obtained for any matter distribution .    with this general approach and by adding other curvature invariants to action ,",

    "the second length @xmath50 is originated from the presence , in the lagrangian , of ricci and riemann tensor square , but also a theory containing only ricci tensor square could show the same outcome ( it is successful replacing the coefficients @xmath101 of _ quadratic lagrangian _ or renaming the function @xmath3 ) . obviously the same is valid also with the riemann tensor square alone .",
    "then a such modification of theory enables a massive propagation of ricci tensor and , as it is well known in the literature , a substitution of ricci scalar with any function of ricci scalar enables a massive propagation of ricci scalar .",

    "in fact we find    @xmath106    and only if we remove in the action ( [ hogaction ] ) the dependence on the ricci square or riemann square we get the known divergence of gr .",
    "for a physical interpretation of solution ( [ sol_new_p ] ) we must impose the condition @xmath107 to have a potential well with a negative minimum in @xmath105 and @xmath108 to have a negative profile of potential ( see fig .",
    "[ plotpotential ] ) . then , if we suppose @xmath109 , we get a constraint on the derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to curvature invariants    @xmath110    in the case of @xmath0-gravity ( @xmath111 ) we reobtain the same condition among the first and second derivatives of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in this paper the theory of gravity induced by a most general fourth order theory obtained by using all curvature invariants has been considered . by adding these curvature invariants , this paper summarized and generalized the topics of previously papers @xcite .",
    "in fact for a generic @xmath5-theory , at newtonian level , it is successful considering only the so - called _ quadratic lagrangian_. all contributions to field equation due by curvature invariant riemann square can be expressed by other two curvature invariants ( ricci tensor square and ricci scalar square ) via gauss - bonnet invariant .    the spherically symmetric solutions of metric tensor at @xmath112(2)-order show a yukawa - like dependence only by two characteristic lengths and not by three ( because we have three curvature invariants in the action ) .",
    "no gauge condition has been considered and the solution of @xmath33-component of metric tensor is general . is general also the solution of @xmath32-component of metric tensor , since it is gauge free ( but only at newtonian order ) .",
    "furthermore , generally it has been shown that for a @xmath5-gravity , but the same is valid also for @xmath0-gravity , the metric potentials are not equal . only in the limit @xmath113",
