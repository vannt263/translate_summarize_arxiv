    "three methods using pulse shapes were introduced to distinguish electrons from multiply scattered photons .",
    "they were applied on data collected with a gerda prototype detector .",
    "single - site dominated samples were distinguished from multi - site dominated samples .",
    "the probability to correctly identify single - site and multi - site events was estimated based on monte carlo calculations . + all three methods were trained with double escape events and events from a nearby photon peak .",
    "the former events are expected to be similar to the expected @xmath1-events .",

    "the power to identify photon induced events does not increase with the straightforward inclusion of the pulse shape of the segment .",
    "+ the performance of the three methods is slightly worse than what was reported in  @xcite .",
    "a reason for this is the purity of the samples . also , the spatial distribution of energy deposited inside the detector is not homogeneous in the @xmath18 sample .",
    "methods to select cleaner and more homogeneous training samples are currently being tested .",
    "+ the artificial neural network shows a better performance than both the likelihood discriminant and the library method .",
    "photon peaks remaining after a single segment cut are suppressed by a factor of about two at energies around 1.5  mev . at the same time 90% of the events in the single - site dominated sample",
    "this demonstrates that the association of a particular peak with the signal process can be substantiated by this kind of analysis .",
    "+ the calculation of the efficiency to correctly identify single - site and multi - site events is limited by the assumed model based on the @xmath28 parameter .",
    "further studies are required ; in particular , a simulation of the development of pulse shapes is important and is currently under development .",
    "studies using additional information from neighboring segments to distinguish single - site from multi - site events are also planned .",

    "+ the rejection of events in the @xmath29  kev peak using segment anti - coincidences as presented in  @xcite is about a factor of two better than the sole application of pulse shape analysis as presented in this paper .",
