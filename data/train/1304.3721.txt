    "the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) facility of cern @xcite began operation in 1999 to carry out high - precision laser spectroscopy of antihydrogen ( @xmath1 ) and antiprotonic helium ( @xmath2 ) atoms .",
    "it was envisaged that by comparing the characteristic transition frequencies of these atoms with the corresponding ones for hydrogen ( h ) in the @xmath1 case , or quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) calculations in the @xmath2 case at the highest possible precision , the consistency of @xmath0 invariance could be tested .",
    "this invariance is deeply engrained within the standard model of particle physics , and implies that particles and their antiparticle counterparts should have exactly the same mass , and charges and magnetic moments of the same values but opposite signs .",
    "atoms should resonate at exactly the same frequency as `` anti - atoms '' made of antiparticles .",
    "precision laser and microwave spectroscopy of atoms and ions of ordinary matter have been carried out for more than 50 years , and in recent years have achieved such a high level of sophistication that transition frequencies have routinely been measured with an experimental precision of better than @xmath17 .",
    "this precision exceeds even the precision by which the international definition of the second can be currently determined .",
    "some experiments are sensitive to minute shifts in the frequencies due to the effects of general relativity .",
    "progress on the anti - atom side is much more difficult due to the simple fact that cold samples are so difficult to synthesize in large quantities .",
    "the constituent antiprotons ( @xmath4 ) and positrons ( @xmath3 ) can only be produced in very small quantities in laboratory nuclear reactions at mev or gev energy scales .",
    "these particles can not be directly used to form stationary atoms that can be used for precision spectroscopy , since their kinetic energy exceeds the ev - scale binding energy by orders of magnitude .",
    "so first the @xmath4 and @xmath3 must be collected using various experimental techniques , and cooled in some cases by 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact for achieving the highest possible experimental precision , one needs the coldest atoms ( @xmath15 k ) where the doppler effect on the measured atomic frequencies caused by thermal motions is minimized .",
    "the ad is currently the world s only facility where @xmath4 of low ( @xmath18 mev ) energy needed for these experiments can be produced .",
    "important milestones achieved at the ad include the production of @xmath1 @xcite in magnetic penning traps .",
    "the @xmath1 were later produced at cryogenic temperatures @xcite , and confined for @xmath6 s in a magnetic bottle trap @xcite .",
    "the first microwave excitations between the ground - state hyperfine substates of @xmath1 were recently demonstrated @xcite .    for @xmath2 @xcite , the atomic transition frequencies were measured by single @xcite and sub - doppler two - photon @xcite laser spectroscopy to a fractional precision of @xmath19 . by comparing the experimental results with qed calculations @xcite , the antiproton - to - electron mass ratio was determined as @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "microwave spectroscopy of @xmath2 allowed the determination of the @xmath4 magnetic moment with a precision of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this agreed with the magnetic moment values derived from previous x - ray spectroscopy experiments on antiprotonic lead atoms with a similar level of precision @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moment of a single @xmath4 confined in a penning trap was recently measured with a much higher precision , as @xmath12@xmath13 @xcite in nuclear magnetons .",
    "this agreed with the known proton value with a fractional precision of @xmath21 .",
    "this experiment employed the continuous stern - gerlach effect , where an inhomogeneous magnetic field of a so - called `` magnetic bottle '' was superimposed on the penning trap .",
    "spin - flips of the @xmath4 resonating with an external rf field were then revealed as small shifts in the oscillation frequency of the @xmath4 s axial motion in the trap .",
    "measurements of various atomic @xcite and nuclear @xcite collision cross sections using low - energy @xmath4 were also carried out .",
    "one experiment studied the biological effectiveness of @xmath4 beams destroying cancer cells @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we review these experimental results obtained during the first 12 years of ad operation .    the ad was conceived as an economical replacement for the previous low energy antiproton ring ( lear ) facility of cern , which was shut down in 1996 @xcite .",
    "lear carried out pioneering studies on @xmath22 violation , meson spectroscopy , and nuclear reactions using high - intensity beams of @xmath4 circulating inside the storage ring , or extracted as a continuous beam of up to @xmath23 s@xmath24 .",
    "the high intensity was often needed because of the small cross sections involved in these particle and nuclear physics experiments .",
    "the facility involved , however , a complex chain of four storage rings ( antiproton collector ( ac ) , antiproton accumulator ( aa ) , proton synchrotron ( ps ) , and lear ) which handled the sequence of first producing the @xmath4 , accumulating and decelerating them to lower energies , and delivering them to experiments .",
    "the ad on the other hand was optimized for precision atomic - physics experiments that were assumed to require far fewer @xmath4 per unit time .",
    "this allowed cern engineers to devise a simplified all - in - one machine where the same sequence was handled by a single storage ring with a cycle time of only @xmath25 s. the ad now routinely provides pulsed beams containing @xmath26 @xmath4 with an emittance of 23 @xmath27 mm mrad and rate of 0.01 hz .    much of the experimental work at ad has concentrated on developing the techniques to decelerate and cool larger numbers of @xmath4 .",
    "the cold @xmath4 were then used as one of the ingredients to synthesize @xmath1 , first by the athena ( antihydrogen apparatus ) @xcite collaboration followed by the atrap @xcite collaboration in 2002 .",
    "more recently , alpha ( antihydrogen laser physics apparatus ) and atrap have cooled clouds of @xmath28@xmath29 @xmath4 confined in magnetic penning traps to cryogenic temperatures @xmath3010 k @xcite .",
    "a small percentage of the @xmath1 synthesized using such cold @xmath4 were of sufficiently low ( @xmath31 k ) temperature that could be subsequently confined in a magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "the asacusa ( antiproton spectroscopy and collisions using slow antiprotons ) experiment introduced a radiofrequency quadrupole decelerator ( rfqd ) in collaboration with cern @xcite .",
    "this 3-m - long device decelerated the 5.3-mev @xmath4 arriving from ad to @xmath32 kev with a high ( @xmath33 ) efficiency @xcite .",
    "the resulting low - energy beam was allowed to come to rest in a helium target , thereby synthesizing @xmath2 atoms which were studied by two - photon laser spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 were also confined in a penning trap @xcite , and extracted as a continuous beam with an energy of @xmath34 kev and average rate 60007000 s@xmath24 .",
    "the ionization cross sections of @xmath4 colliding with gas targets were measured using this beam @xcite .",
    "work is also underway to produce high - intensity spin - polarized @xmath1 beams in the future , which may be used to measure the ground - state hyperfine structure of @xmath1 .",
    "future experiments on the gravitational acceleration of @xmath1 pursued by the ae@xmath35is(antihydrogen experiment : gravity , interferometry , spectroscopy ) @xcite and gbar ( gravitational behavior of antihydrogen at rest ) @xcite collaborations would require @xmath4 beams of even lower ( mk - scale ) energies .",
    "following these developments by the ad collaborations , cern has recently begun the construction of a new synchrotron elena ( extra - low energy antiproton ring ) of 30-m circumference , which would capture the 5.3-mev @xmath4 provided by ad and decelerate them to @xmath36 kev @xcite .",
    "unlike the rfqd described above , elena will reduce the momentum spread of the @xmath4 using electron cooling techniques , thereby achieving a transverse beam emittance of @xmath37 mm mrad .",
    "the number of @xmath4 captured in penning traps per unit time can then be increased by a factor @xmath38 for the ae@xmath35is , alpha , and atrap collaborations which now use the 5.3-mev @xmath4 beam .",

    "the dirac equation implies that for every variety of fermion observed in nature , there is a corresponding antifermion with the same mass and opposite electric charge .",
    "some @xmath40 mev of energy is needed to produce an @xmath41-@xmath3 pair , which is readily available in small accelerators .",
    "the @xmath3 can also be produced by radioactive isotopes that undergo @xmath42 decay .",
    "when @xmath3 are allowed to come to rest in matter , they annihilate with atomic @xmath41 via the electromagnetic interaction , which results in the emission of 23 gamma - rays .",
    "the production of @xmath10-@xmath4 pairs , on the other hand , requires much higher energies of @xmath43 gev ; this is typically accomplished by colliding beams of @xmath44 gev protons on metallic targets .",
    "thus there are only a few large - scale synchrotron facilities where @xmath4 can be produced .",
    "a @xmath4 annihilation with a @xmath10 or neutron ( @xmath45 ) proceeds via strong interaction , and typically results in the emission of several charged and neutral pions ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) within a picosecond .",
    "low - energy @xmath4 and @xmath41 , on the other hand , can elastically scatter off each other without annihilating , a characteristic which is used to cool @xmath4 confined in storage rings and traps .",
    "the properties of particle and antiparticle are related by discrete symmetries @xcite in the standard model .",
    "the substitution of the wavefunction @xmath49 of a particle with its antiparticle @xmath50 can be carried out using the charge conjugation operator @xmath51 .",
    "this changes the signs of all additive quantum numbers ( electric and flavor charges , and baryon and lepton numbers ) , while keeping space - time properties ( mass , energy , momentum , and spin ) as well as multiplicative quantum numbers ( parity ) unchanged .",
    "experimental evidence shows that the laws of electromagnetism , gravity , and strong interaction are invariant under this particle - to - antiparticle transformation ( @xmath52-symmetry ) , and also preserve the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and combined @xmath22 symmetries .",
    "the operator @xmath55 here reverses the space coordinates from right handed to left handed ; the time reversal operator @xmath56 inverts the flow of time , so that the direction of motion and the signs of all time derivatives such as momentum and angular momentum are reversed .",
    "violations of the @xmath54 and @xmath22 symmetries in the strong interaction would cause @xmath45 to have a non - zero value of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite , but no edm has been detected so far to an upper limit of @xmath57 e@xmath58 cm @xcite .    as discovered in the 1950 s , however , the @xmath52 and @xmath53 symmetries are maximally violated in weak interactions : no antineutrinos with left - handed ( lh ) chirality , which results from the application of either the @xmath59-operator on normal lh neutrinos , or the @xmath55-operator on right - handed ( rh ) antineutrinos , have ever been experimentally detected .",
    "the standard model postulates that , i ) : the w@xmath60 bosons which mediate the charged weak force interact only with lh fermions or rh antifermions , and ii ) : the neutral @xmath61 boson interacts with charged leptons and quarks of both chiralities with different strengths ; and only with lh neutrinos or rh antineutrinos , but not their respective rh and lh counterparts .",
    "the weak interaction also violates @xmath22 and @xmath54 symmetries .",
    "one of the mass eigenstates of neutral kaons @xmath62 normally decays either semileptonically , or hadronically into combinations of three neutral and charged pions ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) which comprise a @xmath22 eigenstate of -1 . a small fraction ( @xmath65 ) , however , was found to decay into @xmath66 or @xmath67 pairs @xcite with @xmath68 , which violates the @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "asymmetries were also recently observed in the rates of some decay modes of @xmath69 @xcite and tentatively @xmath70 @xcite and @xmath71 @xcite mesons compared to their antiparticle cases .",
    "@xmath22 violation is incorporated into the standard model in the following way : the three generations of quarks are assumed to change their flavor only through interactions with @xmath72 bosons ( e.g. , @xmath73 ) .",
    "nine such pairings",
    "@xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 between parent and daughter quark states are then possible . the phenomenological 3@xmath73 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix used to describe the coupling constants of these 9 quark-@xmath77 pairings contains complex components that violate @xmath22 symmetry , giving rise to the asymmetries in the meson decays .",
    "the @xmath22 violations measured in the latest experiments , however , are too small to account for the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe .",
    "it is also not understood why the strong interaction between the quarks does not exhibit any observable @xmath22 violation so far .    on the other hand ,",
    "the laws of physics are believed to be perfectly symmetric under the combined transformations of charge conjugation , parity , and time reversal , i.e. , @xmath78@xmath79@xmath49 .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 symmetry was axiomatically proven @xcite to hold for _ any _ relativistic quantum field theory under a few basic assumptions , i ) : lorentz invariance , ii ) : unitarity , i.e. the sum of all quantum - mechanical probabilities is conserved , iii ) : interactions are local , iv ) : flat space - time without strong gravitational fields .",
    "this is called the schwinger - lders - pauli , or @xmath0 , theorem .",
    "an important consequence of @xmath0 symmetry is that particles and their antiparticles have exactly the same mass and lifetimes , and charges and magnetic moments of opposite sign and same absolute value .",
    "a particle propagating in free space can be treated mathematically as if it were an antiparticle of exactly the same mass and opposite charge moving backwards in space and time ( _ feynman - stueckelberg interpretation _ ) .",
    "the @xmath80 operator relates the scattering matrix @xmath81 of a physical process to its inverse process @xmath82 , with all particles replaced by antiparticles and the spin components reversed .",
    "so whereas @xmath0 symmetry implies that the lifetimes ( i.e. , sum of all partial decay rates ) of particle and antiparticle should be exactly the same , the _ partial _ decay rate of a particle decaying into a certain channel does not necessarily need to be equal to its antiparticle case .      although @xmath0 symmetry remains a fundamental property of relativistic quantum field theories , a large number of theoretical and experimental studies have explored its possible breakdown",
    "violation can be introduced by removing some of the assumptions underlying the @xmath0 theorem .",
    "greenberg @xcite showed that in any field theory involving local interactions where unitarity is preserved , @xmath0 violation can only occur if lorentz invariance is violated as well .",
    "the converse is not true : lorentz violation does not necessarily imply @xmath0 violation . in some theories @xcite with nonlocal interactions or noncommutative space - time geometry",
    ", @xmath0 violation can occur without lorentz violation .",
    "colladay and kosteleck @xcite developed a generalized parameterization of an effective field theory called the standard model extension ( sme ) that contains operators that break lorentz and @xmath0 symmetries .",
    "this model encompasses the normal standard model and general relativity , and retains some of their important characteristics such as renormalizability , causality , and invariance and covariance under translations and rotations in the inertial frame of the observer .",
    "sme additionally assumes the existence of a tensor - like `` background field '' , i.e. , a preferred direction in the vacuum which is frozen and extends over all space and time .",
    "lorentz and @xmath0 symmetries are spontaneously broken when two identical experiments which are sensitive to this background field are rotated or translated relative to each other while being studied by an inertial observer . the model is expressed by adding several lorentz and @xmath0-violating terms to the standard - model lagrangian .",
    "limits on the sizes of these coefficients can be experimentally determined by searching for couplings between the background fields and various particle properties such as spin or propagation direction @xcite .",
    "annual and sidereal variations should appear when the earth rotates and revolves around the sun , changing the orientation of the experiment with respect to the field .",
    "no such unambiguous signal has been detected so far .",
    "the axiomatic proofs of the @xmath0 theorem are invalid in the highly - curved space - time near black holes .",
    "some quantum gravity theories @xcite involve quantum fluctuations of space - time geometry that are singular , such as microscopic black holes with event horizons of planck - scale ( @xmath83 m ) sizes .",
    "these backgrounds cause an apparent violation of unitarity , since part of the information such as the quantum numbers of particles can disappear into the event horizon .",
    "pure ground states of quantum gravity thus get mixed and become decoherent as time evolves , since parts of the quantum states are trapped into the event horizons .",
    "@xmath0 is obviously violated here since the @xmath81-matrix of such a process can not be inverted .",
    "several authors @xcite have proposed @xmath0-violating models that give rise to different masses for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",

    "this proton - antiproton comparison eliminated the necessity of measuring the magnetic field @xmath103 with a high absolute accuracy , but systematic errors associated with the reversal of the electrostatic potential needed to trap particles of opposite electric charge limited the experimental precision .    in later experiments @xcite ,",
