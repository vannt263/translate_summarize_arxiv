    "chromosomes , the genetic material of a cell , are duplicated and properly segregated before the cell divides into two daughter cells @xcite .",
    "each of the sister chromatids , that result from chromosome replication , is bound to a proteinous structure , called kinetochore ( kt ) that , in turn , is coupled to the plus ends of stiff polar filaments called microtubules ( mt ) @xcite .",
    "the negative ends of these mts are located at the poles of the fusiform structure , called mitotic spindle @xcite .",
    "the process of chromosome segregation , called mitosis @xcite , is carried out in eukaryotic cells by the dynamic mitotic spindle which is self - organized from its components for this purpose .",
    "there are strong indications that molecular motors @xcite are located at the kt - mt interface ( though not in all eukaryotes ) ; these motor proteins , which are capable of generating force by hydrolyzing atp , are believed to generate poleward force or anti - poleward force depending on the family to which they belong .",
    "however , polymerizing and depolymerizing mts are also found to make significant contributions to the forces that cause chromosomal movements @xcite .",
    "the force - generation capability of depolymerizing mts have been demonstrated _ in - vitro _",
    "however , how a mt maintains contact with the kinetochore while depolymerizing from its tip and how it exerts force on the kt remain challenging open questions in spite of the recent progress in identifying the molecular components of a kt and their spatial organization @xcite , moreover , in most of the eukaryotic organisms multiple mts couple to each kt ; how the ( de-)polymerization of mutiple mts are coordinated is still a mystery .",
    "_ budding yeast _ is a much simpler system because each kt is coupled to only a single mt .",
    "but , even in budding yeast , the two embraced sister chromatids are coupled to two mts approaching them from the two opposite poles of the spindle .",
    "in this paper we theoretically study an even simpler system , namely an isolated kt coupled to a single mt ; this system mimics an _ in - vitro _",
    "experiment @xcite where a single kt - mt attachment was reconstituted using purified extracts from budding yeast . in those",
    "_ in - vitro",
    "_ experiments the average lifetime was found to vary nonmonotonically with the externally applied load tension . in other words ,",
    "the kt - mt attachment is stabilized ( instead of getting destabilized ) at sufficiently small load tension .",
    "similar tension - induced stabilisation of attachment between e - coli fimbriae and target cells have been interpreted in the past in terms of the concept of `` catch - bond '' @xcite .",
    "akiyoshi et al .",
    "@xcite developed a 2-state kinetic model that involves four phenomenological rate constants . by assuming the rate constants to vary exponentially with the load tension",
    ", they obtained a reasonably good fit of the model predictions with their experimental data .",
    "here we do not attempt any quantitative comparison with the experimental data reported in ref.@xcite . instead , our approach allows to derive _ analytical _ expressions for the lifetimes of the kt - mt attachments within the framework of the simple theoretical models that we develop here .",
    "these models describe the polymerization- depolymerization of the mt explicitly and capture the effects of its interaction with the coupler by a potential energy landscape that gets modified when the mt is subjected to an external tension .",
    "therefore , our results for the mean lifetimes provide deep physical insight into the interplay of opposing forces and competing kinetic processes that , together , determine the stability of the kt - mt coupler .",
    "we also make theoretical predictions on the probability distribution of the lifetimes which also indicate the probability of survival of an attachment at least for a time interval @xmath0 after the attachment is established . in principle",
    ", our new predictions can be tested by analyzing the data collected in the _ in - vitro _",
    "experiments provided the experiment is repeated sufficiently large number of times .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sections [ sec - minimalcont ] and [ sec - minimaldisc ]",
    "we develop a _ minimal theoretical model _ of a device that couples a single mt with a single kt and subject it to an external tension .",
    "space is represented by a continuous variable in section [ sec - minimalcont ] and by a discrete variable in section [ sec - minimaldisc ] .",
    "our results on the distribution of the lifetimes of the model kt - mt attachments , derived analytically in section [ sec - minimalcont ] , are compared with the corresponding numerical data , obtained by numerical simulations , in section [ sec - minimaldisc ] .",
    "next , in section [ sec - realistic ] , we extend the minimal model by representing the kt - mt interaction by a more realistic potential . calculation of the full distribution of the lifetimes in this case is too difficult to be carried out analytically .",
    "therefore , in this case we have directly calculated the mean lifetime of the kt - mt attachments and found that the realistic potential leads to quantitative changes without affecting the qualitative features of the kt - mt lifetimes observed in the minimal model .",
    "finally , motivated by recent evidence that the kt - mt coupler in mammalian cells might be a hybrid nano - device , composed of spatially separated active and passive components , we have extended our study also to a simple model of a hybrid coupler in appendix [ sec - hybrid ] .",
    "in the first version of the minimal model space is represented by a continuous variable and the kinetics of the system is formulated in terms of a fokker - planck equation .",
    "we find it more convenient to derive our analytical results using this formulation .",
    "for the convenience of numerical simulations , in the next section , we discretize the same model following prescriptions proposed earlier by wang , peskin and elston ( wpe ) @xcite .",
    "we also compare the results of the two versions .        for the minimal model we do not need to make any assumption about the molecular constituents and their spatial organization in the coupler .",
    "the only postulates are as follows : + _ postulate ( a ) _ : the energy of the system is lowered monotonically with the increasing overlap between the inner surface of the cylindrically shaped coupler and the outer surface of the mt , and the corresponding binding energy is proportional to the projected length of this overlap along the mt axis ; + _ postulate ( b ) _ : the rate of depolymerization of a mt is suppressed by external force .    to our knowledge , the postulate ( a ) is consistent with the scenario envisaged originally by hill @xcite , except for the fact that the `` roughness '' of the mt - coupler interface in the hill model , which is also an integral part of our realistic model ( described in the next section ) , is not captured by the minimal version of our model .",
    "the existence of the sleeve was postulated by hill @xcite long before information on the the molecular structure of mt - kinetochore coupler began to emerge from experiments .",
    "the current knowledge on the inventory of the mitotic machinery have identified the plausible candidates that give rise to the effectively sleeve - like coupler .",
    "the dam1 ring ( also called dash ) and the ndc80 complex seem to be the strongest candidates for the components of the coupler @xcite .",
    "the postulate ( b ) is supported by the observation of franck et al .",
    "@xcite in their _ in - vitro _ experiments that the rate of depolymerization of mt is suppressed by externally applied tension .",
    "it has been known from quite some time that the tips of the depolymerizing protofilaments are curled radially outward from the central axis of the cylindrically shaped mt .",
    "based on this fact , franck et al.@xcite speculated that the dam1 ring complex may transmit the external tension to the curled tips of the protofilaments thereby tending to straighten them .",
    "such straightening of the protofilaments is likely to suppress the tendency of the protofilaments to peel away from the depolymerizing tip of the mt .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our results presented here require only the validity of the postulates ( a ) and ( b ) irrespective of the nature of the underlying cause of their validity .",
    "the length of the `` coupler''is denoted by @xmath1 . in the continuum formulation of the stochastic kinetics ,",
    "the time - dependent variable @xmath2 denotes the instantaneous length of overlap between the outer surface of the mt and inner surface of the coaxial cylindrical coupler .",
    "thus , @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponds to minimum and maximum overlap , respectively ; the mt is just on the verge of exiting the coupler when @xmath3 .",
    "guided by our postulate ( a ) , in the minimal version of our model we capture the mt - coupler interaction by a potential energy that is proportional to the overlap @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 parametrized by @xmath7 , the depth of the potential at @xmath4 .",
    "the form of this interaction in the more realistic version of our model is given in section [ sec - realistic ] .    similarly if the mt is pulled outward away from the coupler by a constant external force @xmath8 ( also referred to as a load tension ) , then this force can be derived from the corresponding potential , @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 are plotted in fig .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "net potential felt by the kinetochore is @xmath12     and @xmath11 are plotted against the instantaneous length of overlap @xmath2 between the outer surface of the mt and inner surface of the coaxial cylindrical coupler . ]",
    "we use the symbols @xmath13 and @xmath14 to denote the addition and removal rates of the tubulin subunit from the mt . when subjected to a load tension , according to our postulate ( b ) , the depolymerization rate @xmath15 of the mt decreases with increasing strength of the tension @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we assume an exponential decrease of @xmath15 such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the depolymerization rate in the absence of any external force and @xmath18 is the characteristic load force at which the mt depolymerization rate is an exponentially small fraction of ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath19 smaller than ) @xmath20 . our motivation for assuming the specific exponential form ( [ eq - fdepbeta ] ) and the key role of the characteristic force @xmath18 will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "stochastic movement of the system can be described by a _ hypothetical diffusing particle in an external potential u(x)_. the drift caused by the addition and removal of the tubulin from mt give rise to an additional term @xmath21 to the drift velocity .",
    "note that the position of the hypothetical particle ( i.e. , the overlap @xmath5 ) can change by any of the following processes : + ( i ) even in the absence of any external force , the mt has a natural tendency to approach @xmath4 because the system can lower its energy by increasing the overlap between the outer surface of the mt and the inner surface of the coupler .",
    "in other words , the potential @xmath10 gives rise an effective force that spontaneously pulls the mt into the coupler .",
    "+ ( ii ) the external load tension can pull the mt outward with respect to the coupler thereby decreasing the overlap @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , an external force can push the mt into the coupler as long as @xmath5 remains non - zero . + (",
    "iii ) the overlap @xmath5 can decrease , as long as it is non - zero , because of the depolymerization of the mt . + ( iv ) the overlap @xmath5 can increase because of the polymerization of mt .",
    "+ ( v ) finally , even in the absence of polymerization or depolymerization and force - induced movements , the position @xmath5 can change because of its one - dimensional diffusion ; @xmath22 being the corresponding diffusion constant .",
    "therefore , in the overdamped limit , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the phenomenological coefficient of the viscous drag and @xmath25 is a gaussian white noise .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the probability of finding the overlap @xmath5 at time @xmath0 .",
    "the fokker planck equation @xcite , @xmath27 that corresponds to the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq - langevin ] ) , is essentially a diffusion equation with an additional drift term where the time - independent , but tension - dependent , net drift velocity is @xmath28 and d is the diffusion constant .",
    "the interplay of the four key components are shown clearly in eqn.([myc ] ) .",
    "the external load tension @xmath8 competes against @xmath29 while mt depolymerization competes against polymerization .",
    "the load tension @xmath8 has two mutually opposite effects on the kinetics : ( i ) it directly tends to decrease @xmath5 by pulling out the mt from the coupler , and ( ii ) it indirectly assists increase of @xmath5 by suppressing @xmath15 that competes against @xmath13 .",
    "the equation ( [ main ] ) can also be written as an equation of continuity @xmath30 for the probability density @xmath26 , with the probability current density @xmath31 \\label{eq - probcurr}\\ ] ] the expression ( [ eq - probcurr ] ) is useful for calculations reported in the sections below .      the specific initial condition and",
    "the boundary conditions that we impose are motivated by the physical situation that our models are intended to capture .",
    "if initial value of @xmath5 is @xmath32 , the corresponding initial condition for ( [ main ] ) can be expressed as @xmath33 throughout this paper we choose @xmath34 , i.e. , maximum overlap between the outer surface of the mt and innser surface of the coaxial cylindrical sleeve - like coupler .",
    "the lifetime of an arbitrary kt - mt attachment is defined here as the time @xmath35 taken by the hypothetical particle , that is initially at @xmath4 , to reach @xmath3 _ for the first time_. thus , @xmath35 is essentially a first passage time @xcite that fluctuates from one attachment to another .",
    "the average value @xmath36 is the mean life time of the attachment .    although @xmath34 initially , @xmath5 does not necessarily decrease monotonically . at any arbitrary instant of time @xmath5",
    "can also increase , just as it can decrease , following the dynamical equations provided @xmath37 .",
    "one advantage of the unique initial condition @xmath34 is that the random variation of the lifetime of the kt - mt attachment from one run to another arises strictly from the intrinsically random kinetics and not from the choice of any random initial condition .",
    "the distribution of the lifetimes of kt - mt coupler that we have derived does not require any further averaging .",
    "in contrast , if a random starting location were selected , one extra averaging ( over sufficiently large number of random initial locations ) would be required to get a meaningful distribution of the lifetimes .",
    "since the mt is not allowed to penetrate the kinetochore plate , and the length of the sleeve - like coupler is @xmath1 , the overlap @xmath5 can not be large than @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath4 we impose a reflecting boundary condition @xmath38 which implies @xmath39 an absorbing boundary condition @xmath40 is imposed so that spontaneous re - formation of the kt - mt is not possible and the time taken for @xmath5 to attain this boundary , starting from its initial value @xmath41 is the first - passage time that we define as the life time of the attachment .",

    "therefore , as shown graphically in fig.[mean](a ) , @xmath58 varies nonmonotonically with @xmath8 for both @xmath59pn and @xmath60pn .",

    "thus , the physical origin of the nonmonotonic variation of @xmath58 with @xmath8 is explained by fig.[mean](a ) in a transparent manner .",
    "the nonmonotonic variation of @xmath58 with @xmath8 is displayed also for all the three different values of the parameter @xmath29 in fig.[mean](b ) ; for any given @xmath8 , the larger is the @xmath29 ( i.e. , the deeper is the potential well ) , the longer is the mean life time of the kt - mt attachment .    using the symbol @xmath62 to denote the tension that corresponds to the maximum of the average lifetime , from ( [ eq - meant ] ) we get @xmath63 the dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath18 , obtained from ( [ eq - fmax ] ) ,",

    "therefore , in both these limits , @xmath8-dependence of @xmath14 drops out and kt - mt attachment behaves like a slip - bond .",
    "the monotonic decrease of @xmath62 with @xmath18 in fig.[mean ] arises from the fact that we have not plotted @xmath58 for even smaller values of @xmath18 where @xmath18 increases with @xmath18 because the corresponding values of @xmath58 turned out to be unphysically long .",

    ", we have shown how the catch - bond - like behavior crosses over to a slip - bond - like behavior . moreover",

    "the slip - bond - like monotonic decrease of @xmath121 with @xmath8 observed in some of the parameter regimes ( whose physical origin has been explained in terms of the nature of @xmath8-dependence of the depolymerization rate @xmath15 ) , might be detectable in experiments under conditions different from those used by akiyoshi et al.@xcite .",
    "as expected , we have found that the molecular motors enhance stability or tend to destabilize the kt - mt attachment depending on whether the force it generates opposes or assists the external tension .",
    "the latter awaits experimental confirmation",
    ". moreover , our analytical predictions on the distribution of the lifetimes will be useful in the future in analyzing the statistical properties of the lifetimes provided the _ in - vitro _",
    "experiment on the reconstituted kt - mt attachment is repeated sufficiently large number of times .    in principle , the models presented here can be further extended by including active force generators like molecular motors @xcite .",
    "however , so far such active force generators have not been detected at the kt - mt interface in budding yeast although such force - generating motors have been found in other cells including , for example , mammalian cells .",
    "but , in contrast to budding yeast , where each kinetochore can attach to only one mt , multiple mts can attach with each kinetochore in a mammalian cell .",
    "since modeling of kt - mt attachment in this paper is focussed almost exclusively on budding yeast , we have not discussed the effects of molecular motors in the main text .",
    "thus , the extended model in appendix b is not a complete model of kt - mt attachment in mammalian cells ; it is intended to indicate how the effects of molecular motors can be incorporated within the broad theoretical framework developed in this paper . in near future",
    "we hope to extend our model to kt - mt attachments in mammalian cells . however , at present , the main hurdle in this modeling is the lack of our current understanding as to how multiple mts attached to the same kt coordinate their kinetics @xcite .",
    "the `` sleeve model '' developed originally by hill @xcite was adapted by joglekar and hunt @xcite , to account for the phenomenon of `` directional instability '' @xcite ( also referred to as chromosome oscillation ) observed during mitosis in vertebrates . in those cells",
    "each kt can attach with several mt ( typically , up to 35 ) and this feature was also incorporated in the model studied by joglekar and hunt by carrying out computer simulations .",
    "our work differs significantly from that of joglekar and hunt @xcite .",
    "first , our model is intended to account for the qualititative features of the results obtained from a much simpler _ in - vitro _",
    "system where only one mt is attached to only a single kt that is subjected to an externally applied load force that , in our model , is assumed to alter the rate of mt depolymerization itself . moreover , because of their motivation in studying directional instability , joglekar and hunt @xcite put major emphasis on monitoring the _ spatial _ displacements that characterize this instability .",
    "in contrast , the quantity of our main interest is the life _ time _ of the kt - mt attachments .",
    "the spatial excursions of the kinetochores was also the main quantity of interest of gardner et al.@xcite who studied the effects of tension - mediated regulation of the kinetics of kinetochore mts by computer simulation of a related model .",
    "the scope of the more detailed model studied by scholey et al.@xcite was even broader .",
    "our force - balance equations are similar , at least in principle , to the force - balance equations formulated by scholey et al.@xcite .",
    "however , instead of the spatial displacements of the kinetochores , the lifetimes of the kt - mt attachments are the main focus of our investigation .",
    "most of the earlier models were based on the assumption that the coupler is a stable sleeve or ring . in recent years",
    ", a new class of models have been developed on the basis of an altogether different assumption regarding the nature of the coupler . in this scenario",
    "@xcite microtubule associated proteins ( maps ) are assumed to make transient attachments with the mt ( i.e. , each map attaches to the mt for a brief duration before getting detached from it ) .",
    "the entropic contribution to the force is significant and slight variation in the mean lifetime of the individual transient attachments of the maps can have large effect on the lifetime of the kt - mt attachment .    in order to account for their experimental observations , akiyoshi et al .",
    "@xcite developed a 2-state kinetic model .",
    "this model was motivated by the formal analogy with the models of ` catch - bonds ' in other systems .",
    "the growing and shrinking states of the mt were argued to be analogs of the strongly- and weakly - bound states in the models of catch - bonds . in their 4-parameter kinetic model ,",
    "two parameters were the rates of transitions between the states of growth and shrinkage of the mt .",
    "the remaining two parameters were the rates of detachment of the kinetochore from the mt while the latter is in the growing and shrinking phases , respectively .",
    "postulating exponential dependence of the type @xmath149 for each of the four rate constants ( n=1,2,3,4 ) , on the external tension @xmath8 , akiyoshi et al .",
    "extracted the numerical values of the 8 parameters @xmath150 ( n=1,2,3,4 ) corresponding to the best fit to their experimental data @xcite .    in their model ,",
    "akiyoshi et al.@xcite did not explicitly treat the kinetics of the polymerization and depolymerization , by attachment and detachment of the successive subunits ( more precisely , the @xmath151 tubulin dimers ) , during the growing and shrinking phases of the mt , respectively .",
    "therefore , the force - dependence of the four rate constants that provide the best fit to their experimental data do not indicate the corresponding force - dependences of the rates of polymerization and depolymerization of the mt .",
    "moreover , the potential energy of interaction between the mt and the coupler as well as the effect of the external tension on this potential energy landscape are not incorporated explicitly in their model .",
    "thus , the model of akiyoshi et al.@xcite does not directly demonstrate the interplay of the opposing forces and competing kinetics .",
    "since neither any structural features of the coupler , nor the nature of its interaction with the mt enters explicitly into akiyoshi et al.s @xcite model , their model can not be used to study the effects of the size and composition of the coupler or that of the nature of the mt - coupler interaction .",
    "neither can it be used to account for the special features of hybrid couplers .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we have used our models to study the effects of varying ( i ) the size of the coupler , ( ii ) relative population of active force generators ( molecular motors ) and passive binders , as well as ( iii ) the depth and roughness of the potential of interaction between the coupler and the mt .      catch bond formed by the fimbriae of e - coli bacteria with target cell surface and",
    "that formed by eukaryotic p - selectin and integrin receptors with their ligands have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite to understand their mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we have focussed exclusively on the kt - mt attachments to understand the mechanism of its catch - bond - like behavior @xcite using simple theoretical models .",
    "one distinct feature of",
    "the mt is that , unlike other ligands , these stiff filaments are capable of generating push and pull by their polymerization and depolymerization , respectively . in particular , the pulling force generated by a mt is powered by the hydrolysis of gtp bound to the tubulin subunits .",
    "as we have shown in this paper , the competing polymerization and depolymerization of mt gives rise to a unique feature of the catch - bond - like behavior of kt - mt attachments where the stable state can be a non - equilibrium ( local ) steady state rather than a local minimum of the free energy of the ligand - receptor system .",
    "we hope the modeling methodology developed here can be usefully adapted to understand the catch - bond - like behavior of depolymerizing actin under load tension observed recently by carrying out _ in - vitro _ experiments with atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite .",

    "<S> before a cell divides into two daughter cells , chromosomes are replicated resulting in two sister chromosomes embracing each other . </S>",
    "<S> each sister chromosome is bound to a separate proteinous structure , called kinetochore ( kt ) , that captures the tip of a filamentous protein , called microtubule ( mt ) . </S>",
    "<S> two oppositely oriented mts pull the two kts attached to two sister chromosomes thereby pulling the two sisters away from each other . here </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically study an even simpler system , namely an isolated kt coupled to a single mt ; this system mimics an _ in - vitro _ experiment where a single kt - mt attachment is reconstituted using purified extracts from budding yeast . </S>",
    "<S> our models not only account for the experimentally observed `` catch - bond - like '' behavior of the kt - mt coupling , but also make new predictions on the probability distribution of the lifetimes of the attachments . in principle , our new predictions can be tested by analyzing the data collected in the _ in - vitro _ </S>",

    "<S> our theory provides a deep insight into the effects of ( a ) size , ( b ) energetics , and ( c ) stochastic kinetics of the kt - mt coupling on the distribution of the lifetimes of these attachments . </S>"
