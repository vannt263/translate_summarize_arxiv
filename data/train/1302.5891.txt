    "carrier multiplication is a process in which a single photon , absorbed by a material , produces several electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs .",
    "typically , this happens when the primary photoexcited e - h pair produces a number of secondary pairs of smaller energy via electron - electron collisions .",
    "this process is very important for optoelectronic applications : the more e - h pairs are produced by a single photon , the more efficiently one can convert light into electric current .",
    "graphene is an obvious candidate for efficient carrier multiplication , since ( i )  it has wide electronic bands and no energy gap , and ( ii )  electron - electron scattering can be much faster than electron - phonon scattering . indeed , the dynamics of photoexcited carriers in graphene has become a subject of many studies , both theoretical and experimental.@xcite    in spite of the numerous studies , this dynamics is still not fully understood .",
    "notably , the most basic issue , that of the role of electron - electron collisions in the relaxation of a single photoexcited carrier in the intrinsic graphene , is still under debate .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.  g. , ref .  ) that due to simultaneous energy and momentum conservation , decay of quasiparticles is allowed or forbidden , depending on the curvature of the quasiparticle spectrum . in the context of graphene , the dirac spectrum is linear , so it is exactly on the borderline between the two cases.@xcite indeed , if an electron in the conduction band with momentum  @xmath0 and energy @xmath1 ( @xmath2  being the dirac velocity ) is scattered into the state with another momentum  @xmath3 and lower energy @xmath4 , creating a hole in the valence band with momentum  @xmath5 and another electron in the conduction band with momentum @xmath6 , the momentum and energy conservation conditions ,    @xmath7    are compatible only in the special case when all vectors lie on the same line .",
    "different ways to resolve the uncertainty have been advocated.@xcite note that the collision process in question is precisely the one responsible for carrier multiplication ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collisions ] ) .     various collision processes for an excited electron in the conduction band .",
    "the straight lines represent the dirac cones and the circles represent electrons .",
    "processes ( a ) ,  ( b ) conserve the number of carriers in the conduction and valence bands separately . processes ( a)(c ) are forbidden by the pauli principle in the intrinsic graphene at zero temperature .",
    "process  ( d ) corresponds to carrier multiplication ( the initial electron produces one more electron and one hole ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    it might seem that importance of the above - mentioned problem of a single excited carrier is limited to low photoexcitation intensities .",
    "however , if many e - h pairs are created under intense photoexcitation , it is important to know whether the population equilibration between the valence and the conduction band happens as quickly as the thermalization within each band .",
    "for example , only if the interband population relaxation is slow enough , a population inversion between the bands can be achieved , and one can think about lasing . among various two - electron collision processes , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collisions ] , only the processes ( d )  ( carrier multiplication ) and ( c )  ( auger recombination , reciprocal to the multiplication ) can transfer electrons between the bands .",
    "if these are suppressed , three - particle collisions are required to equilibrate the populations of the conduction and the valence bands .    in the present work , we study relaxation of an excited electron in the conduction band of intrinsic graphene at zero temperature due to electron - electron collisions ( the process  ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : collisions ] ) , going beyond the dirac approximation and taking into account the electronic band curvature .",
    "because the curvature is anisotropic due to the trigonal warping , the result turns out to depend on the direction of the initial electron momentum , as was also noted in ref .  .",
    "for a certain range of directions , the process is forbidden . for the directions when relaxation is allowed",
    ", we calculate its rate",
    ".    if the curvature is weak , the problem corresponds to that of a discrete state coupled to a continuum whose density of states is abruptly cut off precisely at the energy of the discrete level , which can be viewed as a special case of the fano problem.@xcite indeed , in the sector with the fixed total momentum  @xmath0 , the single - particle excitation is a discrete level with the energy @xmath8 .",
    "the three - particle density of states vanishes below this energy , and exhibits a steplike discontinuity at the energy @xmath8 .",
    "in this situation , the presumable decay of the discrete state into the continuum can not be described by the fermi golden rule , since the latter is valid only when the density of states in the continuum is a smooth function of energy at the position of the discrete level .",
    "below it is shown that the quantum - mechanical level repulsion between the discrete state and the continuum plays a major role in this problem . as a result ,",
    "a nondecaying quasiparticle state exists ( that is , its lifetime being determined by mechanisms other that electron - electron interaction ) . still , the quasiparticle spectral weight is reduced , some part of it being transferred to the continuum of the multiparticle excitations",
