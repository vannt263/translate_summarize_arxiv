    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) so far has met all experimental challenges and is now tested at the @xmath4 level  @xcite . however , there is little direct experimental information on the mechanism which generates the masses of the weak gauge bosons . in the sm ,",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is responsible for mass generation .",
    "the existence of a higgs boson is a direct consequence of this mechanism . at present",
    "the negative result of direct searches performed at lep2 imposes a lower bound of @xmath5  gev  @xcite on the higgs boson mass .",
    "indirect information on the mass of the higgs boson can be extracted from the @xmath6 dependence of radiative corrections to the @xmath0 boson mass , @xmath7 , and the effective weak mixing angle , @xmath8 . assuming the sm to be valid , a global fit to all available electroweak precision data yields a ( one - sided ) 95% confidence level ( cl ) upper limit on @xmath6 of about 260  gev  @xcite .",
    "future more precise measurements of @xmath7 and the top quark mass , @xmath9 , will lead to more accurate information on the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "currently , the @xmath0 boson mass is known to @xmath10  mev  @xcite from direct measurements .",
    "the uncertainties of the individual experiments contributing to this value are between about 80  mev and 110  mev  @xcite .",
    "the present uncertainty of the top quark mass from direct measurements is @xmath11  gev  @xcite . with a precision of 30  mev ( 10  mev ) for the @xmath0 mass , and 2  gev for the top quark mass ,",
    "@xmath6 can be predicted from a global analysis with an uncertainty of about @xmath12 ( @xmath13 )  @xcite .",
    "comparison of these indirect constraints on @xmath6 with the results from direct higgs boson searches at lep2 , the tevatron collider , and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be an important test of the sm .",
    "they will also provide restrictions on the parameters of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "a significant improvement in the @xmath0 mass uncertainty is expected in the near future from measurements at lep2  @xcite and the fermilab tevatron @xmath14 collider  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate precision expected for @xmath7 from the combined lep2 experiments is 30   40  mev  @xcite . at the tevatron ,",
    "integrated luminosities of order 2  fb@xmath15 are envisioned in the main injector era ( run  ii ) , and one expects to measure the @xmath0 mass with a precision of approximately 40  mev  @xcite per experiment .",
    "the prospects for a precise measurement of @xmath7 would further improve if a significant upgrade in luminosity beyond the goal of the main injector could be realized . with recent advances in accelerator technology",
    "@xcite , tevatron collider luminosities of order @xmath16 may become a reality , resulting in integrated luminosities of up to 10  fb@xmath15 per year . with a total integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath15 , one can target a precision of the @xmath0 mass of 15   20  mev  @xcite . a similar or better accuracy",
    "may also be reached at the lhc  @xcite .    in order to measure the @xmath0 boson mass with high precision in a hadron collider environment ,",
    "it is necessary to fully understand and control higher order qcd and electroweak ( ew ) corrections to @xmath0 production .",
    "the determination of the @xmath0 mass in a hadron collider environment requires a simultaneous precision measurement of the @xmath1 boson mass , @xmath17 , and width , @xmath18 .",
    "these quantities serve as reference points . when compared to the value measured at lep , they help to accurately determine the energy scale and resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter , and to constrain the muon momentum resolution  @xcite . in order to extract @xmath7 from hadron collider data ,",
    "it is therefore also necessary to understand the higher order qcd and ew corrections to @xmath1 boson production in hadronic collisions .",
    "electroweak radiative corrections have a significant impact on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson masses and widths extracted from experiment .",
    "recent improved calculations of the @xmath19 ew corrections to @xmath0 production  @xcite , and of the @xmath19 qed corrections to @xmath1 production in hadronic collisions  @xcite , have shown that the main effect is caused by final state photon radiation .",
    "when detector effects are included , @xmath19 radiative corrections shift the @xmath0 mass by about @xmath20  mev in the electron case , and approximately @xmath21  mev in the muon case  @xcite . the effect on the @xmath1 mass is about a factor two larger than that on @xmath7 for both electron and muon final states .",
    "@xmath19 photon emission also shifts the width of the @xmath0 boson extracted from the tail of the transverse mass distribution by approximately @xmath22  mev  @xcite .",
    "the size of the shift in @xmath7 , @xmath17 and the @xmath0 width introduced by the @xmath19 corrections raises the question of how strongly @xmath23 corrections affect these quantities .    in order to reliably calculate the impact of the @xmath23 corrections to @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses extracted from experiment , a full calculation including real and virtual corrections , which is valid over the entire allowed phase space , is needed .",
    "so far , only partial calculations for the @xmath27 real photon corrections , @xmath28 and @xmath29 exist  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the structure function approach for photon radiation is used to perform the calculation and , therefore , only final state photon radiation in the leading log approximation is included .",
    "the results obtained using this approach are reliable only for small opening angles between the photons and the charged leptons . the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the full set of tree level feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath30 and @xmath31 production .",
    "in addition , to preserve gauge invariance when finite @xmath0 width effects are included , the imaginary part of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 one - loop vertex corrections is taken into account .",
    "however , charged leptons are assumed to be massless , and thus a finite lepton ",
    "photon separation cut has to be imposed in order to avoid the collinear singularities associated with final state radiation .",
    "the first step towards a calculation of the @xmath23 corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production in hadronic collisions thus is to perform a calculation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 production which    * is based on the full set of feynman diagrams contributing at tree level , * includes finite lepton mass effects , * is gauge invariant when finite @xmath0 width effects are taken into account , * and is valid for arbitrary lepton ",
    "photon opening angles .",
    "in addition , in order to obtain reliable information on the shift in @xmath7 and @xmath17 caused by two photon radiation , the numerical calculation should be stable for photon energies as small as the tower threshold of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the tevatron experiments , which is of @xmath34  mev ) . in this paper",
    "we present such a calculation .    while the calculation of the @xmath3 and @xmath35 matrix elements is straightforward , the phase space integration presents some challenges , due to the sharp peaks in the matrix elements which arise from the soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the collinear singularities associated with final state radiation are regulated by the finite mass of the leptons whereas soft and initial state collinear singularities are rendered finite by transverse momentum cuts imposed on the photons .",
    "both soft and collinear singularities produce large contributions to the cross section in small regions of phase space .",
    "standard adaptive monte carlo integration routines such as vegas  @xcite do not yield a numerically stable result of the cross section for processes which exhibit a complicated peaking structure in the matrix elements . to obtain numerically stable and accurate results for such processes , a multi - channel monte carlo approach  @xcite , augmented by the adaptive weight optimization procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , is frequently used .",
    "the disadvantage of the multi - channel monte carlo approach is that the peaks in the matrix elements have to be mapped by hand , thus requiring a substantial amount of analytic work which has to be repeated for each new process one wishes to analyze .",
    "our calculation is based on a similar approach which adds the benefit of largely automizing the mapping of the peaks in the matrix elements .",
    "the process independent features of our approach , and the resulting multiconfiguration monte carlo ( mcmc ) integration program , are briefly described in sec .",
    "full details will be given elsewhere  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss technical details associated with the calculation of the @xmath3 and @xmath35 matrix elements and present numerical results for two photon radiation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 events at the tevatron collider ( @xmath14 collisions at 1.8  tev ) .",
    "finally , summary remarks are given in sec .",
    "the matrix elements for @xmath3 and @xmath35 have many sharply peaked regions throughout phase space .",
    "in addition to the breit - wigner resonances around the @xmath0 or @xmath1 pole and a pole at small @xmath36 invariant masses due to photon exchange , there are singularities when either photon becomes soft , or collinear with a charged particle .",
    "although these soft and collinear singularities are regulated by energy or transverse momentum cuts and fermion masses , they result in large contributions to the cross section over relatively small regions of phase space and cause difficulties for standard integration techniques .",
    "integrating over the parton distributions and final state momenta in general requires performing a @xmath37 dimensional integral over a phase space which may include many cuts . here",
    "@xmath38 is the number of particles in the final state .",
    "if the number of dimensions is large , the integral is most easily carried out using monte carlo techniques .",
    "monte carlo integration approximates the integral by taking the average of a number of points , @xmath39 , selected at random , and multiplying by the volume , @xmath40 , over which one is integrating , @xmath41 provided the function @xmath42 which is to be integrated is sufficiently flat , the number of points for convergence is independent of the number of dimensions .",
    "however , if @xmath42 is sharply peaked convergence may be exponentially slow .    in order to use monte carlo techniques for integrating a sharply peaked function ,",
    "it is necessary to remove the peaks .",
    "peaks which are analytically integrable , and for which the integral is invertible , can be smoothed with the appropriate transformation of variables .",
    "a breit - wigner resonance is an excellent example for such a case .",
    "the transformation @xmath43 removes the peak and makes the integrand flat .",
    "collinear and soft poles often require more involved transformations which may not have general analytical solutions .",
    "adaptive monte carlo programs such as vegas are able to flatten peaks by using numeric approximations of the integrand .",
    "the result is not as fast , or efficient as analytically removing the peaks , however it is more convenient . for most applications",
    "this is very desirable .",
    "the major restriction is that programs such as vegas can only remove peaks which are in the plane of one of the integration variables .",
    "for example , these programs will successfully flatten the peaks in the function @xmath44 but they will not be able to flatten those for @xmath45 unless a change of variables is performed . for processes with relatively few peaks , it is usually possible to map each peak to one of the integration variables . for complicated process such as @xmath3 and @xmath35 ,",
    "this is not the case .    in cases where it is not possible to simultaneously map every peak to an integration variable",
    ", there are two classes of solutions available .",
    "the first is to divide up phase space with cuts , such that the peaks in each region can be mapped to the integration variables .",
    "an adaptive monte carlo integration routine is used for each region separately .",
    "the results from each region are combined to obtain the total cross section .",
    "this method is effective for processes with relatively simple peaking structure , however as the number of peaks increases the technique quickly becomes cumbersome and prone to error .",
    "the second technique  @xcite is to choose points in phase space not according to a single distribution , but according to the sum of multiple distributions .",
    "each distribution is responsible for a specific set of peaks .",
    "the optimal number of points from each distribution is chosen using an algorithm which minimizes the monte carlo integration error  @xcite . with each channel , a different set of poles",
    "is analytically removed .",
    "the resulting code is very fast and efficient , however it requires significant analytic work , which must be repeated for each new process .    in our approach , we have combined the power of multichannel integration with the convenience offered by adaptive monte carlo integration routines such as vegas .",
    "the result is a general and flexible multiconfiguration monte carlo program called mcmc which can numerically integrate sharply peaked functions in many dimensions with minimal input from the user .",
    "feynman diagrams offer a convenient mechanism for determining in which dimensions peaks may appear . at tree level strong peaks in the cross section",
    "are always associated with a propagator going on - shell .",
    "we have implemented a general phase - space generator based on feynman diagrams . given a tree - level feynman diagram , it maps a set of random numbers to a point in phase space such that each propagator represents one of the dimensions of integration .",
    "the operation is invertible so it can also return the set of random numbers associated with any point in phase space .",
    "the user specifies the momentum flow of the contributing feynman diagrams in a simple include file , together with the masses and widths of the breit - wigner resonances which appear in each diagram .",
    "all other aspects of the phase space integration are handled automatically by the program .",
    "a more detailed description of the approach will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the convenience of mcmc is best illustrated in a simple example .",
    "consider the process @xmath46 for a center of mass energy of @xmath47  gev , where each of the final state particles is required to have a transverse momentum @xmath48  gev .",
    "the electron mass is assumed to be variable .",
    "the six feynman diagrams associated with this process can easily be generated with a program such as madgraph  @xcite .",
    "the diagrams generated by madgraph are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "each diagram represents a phase space configuration in the mcmc code with the appropriate poles mapped to the integration variables .",
    "these configurations are input to the integration package , which then searches for peaks , and determines the optimal number of points to choose from each configuration using an algorithm which minimizes the integration error .",
    "table  [ tab : mass ] compares the cross sections obtained using the traditional single configuration approach with those from mcmc as the electron mass is varied from 0.01  gev to 10  gev .",
    "notice that for large masses , the matrix element is relatively flat and a single configuration accurately integrates the cross section .",
    "however , as the electron mass decreases , the contribution from the collinear regions becomes increasingly important , and the single configuration package is unable to accurately integrate the function .",
    "not only is the error larger , but even with @xmath49 integration points , the single configuration integration is giving the wrong result as it samples all of the points from the peaks it has mapped to integration variables , completely neglecting the peaks which are only sampled by the other configurations . due to the mass singular terms associated with final state radiation in the collinear limit , the cross section scales approximately with @xmath50 for small electron masses , @xmath51  gev .",
    "this provides a simple check on the accuracy of the mcmc result .",
    "the primary difference between our approach and other multichannel techniques is its generality .",
    "the mapping of uniformly distributed random numbers to points in phase space can be broken down into two steps .",
    "first the uniformly distributed random numbers are deformed into non - uniform numbers , with a corresponding jacobian .",
    "next these non - uniform numbers are mapped to four - momenta in phase space with another jacobian . for each step , one can choose to perform an analytic transformation which will be very efficient for the particular process being studied , or one can choose a general transformation which is not optimized for the specific process , but will work for any process .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite produces highly optimized code for both transformations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a general procedure for the transformation from uniform space to a deformed space is given , but optimized procedures for the transformation to phase space are chosen .",
    "the mcmc program provides general algorithms for both transformations , similar to the approach used by comphep  @xcite to perform the phase space integration .",
    "the resulting code is in general slightly slower than that resulting from the other two approaches , however we believe its user friendliness makes up for this short coming .",
    "the advantage of user friendly programs at the expense of computer time has already been demonstrated by packages such as madgraph , comphep  @xcite and grace  @xcite which quickly produce non - optimized tree - level matrix elements .",
    "indeed the synthesis of the integration package outlined here with automatically generated matrix elements will allow the user to concentrate on the physics issues rather than numerical integration techniques . while mcmc naturally interfaces with madgraph and helas  @xcite , matrix elements resulting from any other automated or non - automated calculation can be used .",
    "we shall now discuss the calculation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 production in hadronic collisions , together with some phenomenological applications relevant for future @xmath0 mass measurements at hadron colliders . to calculate the matrix elements for @xmath52 and @xmath2 we use madgraph which automatically generates the sm matrix elements in helas format .",
    "when photon exchange is taken into account , 40  feynman diagrams contribute to @xmath31 production , while there are 21  diagrams for @xmath53 production .",
    "taking into account symmetries in the phase space mapping , 20  ( 12 ) different configurations contribute to @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .    in order to maintain electromagnetic gauge invariance for @xmath2 in presence of finite @xmath0 width effects , the @xmath0 propagator and the @xmath32 and @xmath33 vertex functions in the amplitudes generated by madgraph have to be modified  @xcite .",
    "finite width effects are included by resumming the imaginary part of the @xmath0 vacuum polarization , @xmath56 .",
    "the transverse part of @xmath56 receives an imaginary contribution @xmath57 while the imaginary part of the longitudinal piece vanishes .",
    "the @xmath0 propagator is thus given by @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the @xmath0 width .",
    "a gauge invariant expression for the amplitude is then obtained by attaching the final state photons to all charged particle propagators , including those in the fermion loops which contribute to @xmath56 . as a result ,",
    "the lowest order @xmath32 and @xmath33 vertex functions , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are modified  @xcite to @xmath63 the sm parameters used in our numerical calculations are @xmath64  gev , @xmath65  gev , @xmath66  gev , @xmath67  gev , and @xmath68 .",
    "these values are consistent with recent measurements at lep , lep2 , the slc and the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "we use the parton distribution functions set  a of martin - roberts - stirling  @xcite with the factorization scale set equal to the parton center of mass energy @xmath69 .",
    "all numerical results are obtained for @xmath14 collisions with a center of mass energy of @xmath70  tev . in run  ii",
    ", the tevatron collider is foreseen to operate at @xmath71  tev . for a center of mass energy of 2  tev , results qualitatively similar to those reported here are obtained .",
    "cross sections are about 5% higher than those found for @xmath70  tev .",
    "since the total cross sections for @xmath72 and @xmath73 production are equal in @xmath14 collisions , we shall not consider the @xmath73 channel in the following ."
