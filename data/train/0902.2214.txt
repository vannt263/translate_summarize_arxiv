    "in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation , galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in galaxy evolution .",
    "typically , these mergers are divided into two categories .",
    "`` minor '' mergers ( with mass ratios @xmath4 ) are often thought to trigger moderate bursts of increased star formation and/or morphological disturbances , as well as contributing to the deposition of diffuse light components of galaxies . `` major '' mergers ( with mass ratios @xmath5 ) are likely to influence stronger morphological disturbances responsible for the transformation from disk - dominated to bulge - dominated morphologies , in addition to triggering stronger starburst and agn activity .    despite this commonly adopted distinction between major and minor mergers at merger mass ratios of @xmath6 , there is still ambiguity in what mass is used to _ define _ this ratio .",
    "theoretical investigations of dark matter halo merger rates typically define merger ratios in terms of dark matter halo masses , the most theoretically robust prediction from cosmological @xmath7-body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references within ) . but because estimates of dark matter halo masses are difficult to obtain observationally , it is also common to define merger ratios by comparing the stellar masses or the total baryonic masses of galaxies .    in attempting to compare theoretically derived merger statistics ( in terms of dark matter mass ratios ) to observational investigations of galaxy mergers ( in terms of stellar or galaxy mass ratios ) , it is important to understand the mapping between these definitions .",
    "galaxy merger rates , for example , are quite sensitive to the merger mass ratio being considered @xcite . in order to explore the fundamental differences between major mergers as defined by dark matter halo , stellar , and galaxy merger ratios",
    ", we adopt a semi - empirical methodology to estimate the stellar and cold gas content of dark matter halos as a function of halo mass and redshift .",
    "we give a very brief overview of this method before presenting our findings , but we refer reader to @xcite for a more in - depth discussion of this method .",
    "in order to assign stars to our halos , we assume a monotonic relationship between halo mass and stellar mass . using this technique ,",
    "provided we know @xmath8 ( the cumulative number density of galaxies with stellar mass more massive than @xmath9 ) we may determine the associated dark matter halo population by finding the halo mass above which the number density of halos ( including subhalos ) matches that of the galaxy population , @xmath10 . specifically , we adopt the relation found by @xcite ( interpolated from the data in their figure 2 ) . of course , a simple relation of this kind can not be correct in detail , but in an average sense , it provides a good characterization of the relationship between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass that must hold in order for lcdm to reproduce the observed universe .    in order to assign gas to the central galaxies within our halos , we quantify observationally - inferred relations between gas fraction and stellar mass .",
    "specifically , we characterize the data from @xcite ( disk - dominated galaxies at @xmath11 ) and @xcite ( uv - selected galaxies at @xmath12 ) with a relatively simple function of stellar mass and redshift ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and find that this adopted characterization is also consistent with a number of other observationally motivated works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "having estimated the stellar and cold gas content of dark matter halos as a function of halo mass and redshift , we define three different means of identifying the mass of a galaxy ( and thus , define merger mass ratios ) :    1 .",
    "the mass ( or mass ratio ) of each dark matter halo , @xmath13 .",
    "we will refer to these as the _ dm mass ( ratio ) _ of a galaxy ( merger ) .",
    "the mass ( mass ratio ) of the stellar mass of each dark matter halo s central galaxy , @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to this definition as the _ stellar mass ( ratio)_. 3 .   the mass ( mass ratio ) of the total baryonic mass of each dark matter halo s central galaxy , @xmath15 .",
    "in this case , we define a galaxy s baryonic mass as a combination of its stellar mass and cold gas mass ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we refer to this definition as the _ galaxy mass ( ratio)_.    using these mass definitions , we show the stellar and galaxy mass of a dark matter halo s central galaxy as a function of halo mass ( and normalized by halo mass ) in figure [ mmdm ] , where solid and dashed lines represent galaxies at @xmath11 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that these mass fractions are a strong function of halo mass , and evolve with redshift .",
    "it is clear from this figure that a single merger event between galaxies may have a drastically different mass ratio in dark mater compared to its mass ratio in stars ( or baryons ) .",
    "this could have important implications for observational efforts to measure the merger rate : morphological disturbances will be affected by high total mass ratio events , while pair count estimates will be more sensitive to the mass ratio in visible light .",
    "we explore the various mappings between major mergers using different mass definitions in figure [ mmdef ] . in the top panels we focus on mergers with @xmath18 ( henceforth _ major dm mergers _ ) , with the dashed and dotted lines showing the corresponding stellar and galaxy mass ratios of these mergers . in the bottom panels ,",
    "we instead focus on _ major stellar mergers _ ,",
    "defined by @xmath19 . in these panels ,",
    "the solid and dotted lines correspond to the dm and galaxy mass ratios of these mergers .",
    "the left and right panels show relations at @xmath11 and @xmath17 , respectively .    we emphasize that , in general , the dm mass ratio between two galaxies is _ not _ the same as the stellar ( or galaxy ) mass ratio .",
    "specifically , major dm mergers ( top panels ) correspond to stellar mass ratios ranging from @xmath20 @xmath21 and galaxy mass ratios of @xmath22 @xmath23 for @xmath24 halos at @xmath11 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "similarly , major stellar mergers ( bottom panels ) correspond to dm mass ratios from @xmath26 @xmath27 and galaxy mass ratios of @xmath28 @xmath29 for @xmath24 halos at @xmath11 @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the _ only _ broad regime where different mass definitions result in similar merger ratios is for stellar and galaxy merger ratios of massive galaxies , where galaxy gas fractions are typically low enough that @xmath31 .",
    "note that in @xmath2 halos , major dm mergers should contain stellar mass ratios @xmath3 .",
    "the smaller galaxy in these mergers contain significant mass in dark matter , and should be capable of triggering severe morphological disruption in the primary galaxy , but they are observationally `` invisible , '' with negligible luminous content with respect to the primary .",
    "the existence of these `` invisible '' major mergers is a robust , testable prediction of lcdm .",
    "while theoretical investigations into dark matter halo merger rates define mergers by dm mass ratios , observed merger rates ( specifically , those based on close - pair counts of galaxies ) typically select pairs based on luminosity ( stellar mass ) , and should thus constitute major _ stellar _ mergers .",
    "the mapping between stellar and dm mass ratios has two important qualitative effects in this case .",
    "first , for smaller halos , major dm mergers should correspond to substantially smaller stellar mass ratios , and may not be distinguishable as a luminous close - pair when observed ( ie .",
    "faint / invisible major mergers ) .",
    "second , for massive halos , some observed close - pairs with comparable luminosities ( major stellar mergers ) may correspond to substantially smaller _ dm _ mass ratios , and would be counted as _ minor _ ( not major ) mergers in theoretical predictions from @xmath7-body simulations ( ie .",
    "bright minor mergers ) .    for a more quantitative analysis",
    ", we adopt the fitting function for @xmath32 from @xcite ( table 1 , infall , `` simple fit '' ) , which provides the rate of mergers more massive than @xmath13 into dark matter halos of mass @xmath33 ( per halo , per gyr ) as a function of redshift , mass , and mass ratio . for @xmath34 dark matter halos and dm merger ratios @xmath35 at @xmath36 , the merger rate increases from @xmath37 .",
    "now consider an identical halo mass , but for mergers selected on _ stellar _ mass ratios @xmath35 , corresponding to a dm mass ratio of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) at @xmath11 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "because of the minor dm mergers being considered , this selection would result in an artificial increase of the observed merger rate by a factor of @xmath40 compared to dm merger rates ( @xmath41 from @xmath36 ) , with a redshift evolution that is too steep ( and does not appear to fit well to @xmath42 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , using different mass ratios to define mergers has a substantial effect on predictions of galaxy merger rates , and great care must be taken when comparing studies of galaxy or halo mergers , if the merger mass ratios have been defined by different criterion .       , i.  k. , glazebrook , k. and driver , s.  p. , 2008",
