    "galactic evolution is driven at the end - points of stellar evolution , where copious mass loss returns chemically - enriched and sometimes dusty matter back to the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; the stellar winds of evolved stars and the violent deaths of the most massive stars also inject energy and momentum into the ism , generating turbulence and galactic fountains when superbubbles pop as they reach the `` surface '' of the galactic disc .",
    "the evolved stars are also excellent tracers , not just of the feedback processes , but also of the underlying populations , that were formed from millions to billions of years prior to their appearance",
    ". the evolved phases of evolution generally represent the most luminous , and often the coolest , making evolved stars brilliant beacons at ir wavelengths , where it is also easier to see them deep inside galaxies as dust is more tranpsarent at those longer wavelengths than in the optical and ultraviolet where their main - sequence progenitors shine .",
    "the final stages of stellar evolution of stars with main - sequence masses up to @xmath6 m@xmath1  asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and red supergiants  are characterised by strong radial pulsations of the cool atmospheric layers , rendering them identifiable as long - period variables ( lpvs ) in photometric monitoring campaigns spanning months to years ( e.g. , whitelock , feast & catchpole 1991 ; wood 2000 ) .",
    "the local group galaxy triangulum ( hodierna 1654 )  hereafter referred to as m33 ( messier 1771 )  offers us a unique opportunity to study stellar populations , their history and their feedback across an entire spiral galaxy and in particular in its central regions , that in our own milky way are heavily obscured by the intervening dusty disc ( van loon et al .",
    "2003 ; benjamin et al .",
    "our viewing angle with respect to the m33 disc is more favourable ( 56@xmath7  zaritsky , elston & hill 1989 ; deul & van der hulst 1987 ) than that of the larger m31 ( andromeda ) , whilst the distance to m33 is not much different from that to m31 ( @xmath8 mag  bonanos et al .",
    "large populations of agb stars have been identified in m33 ( cioni et al .",
    "2008 ) , and red supergiants up to progenitor masses in excess of 20 m@xmath1 ( drout , massey & meynet 2012 ) .",
    "many of them are dusty lpvs ( mcquinn et al .  2007 ; thompson et al .",
    "2009 ) , and these have been found also in the central parts of m33 ( javadi , van loon and mirtorabi 2011a ) .",
    "the main objectives of our project are described in javadi , van loon & mirtorabi ( 2011c ) : to construct the mass function of lpvs and derive from this the star formation history in m33 ; to correlate spatial distributions of the lpvs of different mass with galactic structures ( spheroid , disc and spiral arm components ) ; to measure the rate at which dust is produced and fed into the ism ; to establish correlations between the dust production rate , luminosity , and amplitude of an lpv ; and to compare the _ in situ _ dust replenishment with the amount of pre - existing dust .",
    "paper i in the series presented the photometric catalogue of stars in the inner square kpc ( javadi et al .",
    "2011a ) , and paper ii presented the galactic structure and star formation history in the inner square kpc ( javadi , van loon and mirtorabi 2011b ) .",
    "this is paper iii , describing the mass - loss mechanism and dust production rate in the inner square kpc .",
    "subsequent papers in the series will cover the extension to a nearly square degree area covering much of the m33 optical disc .",
    "to derive the mass - loss rates of the red giant variables we follow a two - step approach .",
    "first , we model the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of near - ir variables for which mid - ir counterparts have been identified .",
    "we use these results to construct relations between the dust optical depth and bolometric corrections on the one hand , and near - ir colours on the other .",
    "then , we apply those relations to the red giant variables for which no mid - ir counterpart was identified , to derive their mass - loss rates too .      images in the j , h and k@xmath9 bands were obtained with the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) with the uist instrument , covering an area of approximately @xmath10 corresponding to a square kpc at the distance of m33 .",
    "observations in the k@xmath9 band were made on about a dozen occasions over the period of 20032007 .",
    "the data , point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and variability analysis are described in paper i. the full , publicly available catalogue contains 18398 stars ; 812 of these were identified as variables on the basis of the near - ir photometry alone , most of them pulsating red giant stars ( agb stars and red supergiants ) .",
    "images in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath11 m bands were obtained with the _ spitzer _ space telescope with the irac instrument , on six occasions over the period of 20042006 .",
    "we use the photometric catalogue of mcquinn et al.(2007 ) , which is based on psf fitting with daophot to the first five epochs and excludes the less sensitive 5.8 @xmath11 m band .",
    "thompson et al.(2009 ) have published a somewhat deeper catalogue in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath11 m bands including the sixth epoch , but they have not made publicly available their photometry obtained at longer wavelengths and we therefore prefer working with the homogeneous catalogue of mcquinn et al .",
    "we cross - matched our near - ir catalogue to their catalogue ( see paper i for details ) and found 523 matches in the 3.6 @xmath11 m band , 471 at 4.5 @xmath11 m and 107 at 8 @xmath11 m ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we noticed ( in paper i ) a discrepancy between the [ 3.6][4.5 ] colours and theoretical isochrones ( from marigo et al .",
    "2008 ) , with the faintest stars being abnormally blue .",
    "this is not apparent in the colour  magnitude diagram of m33 as a whole ( see mcquinn et al .",
    "2007 ) and is most likely related to the specific challenges encountered in the crowded central regions of the galaxy ( though strong absorption in the fundamental band of carbon monoxide can depress the 4.5 @xmath11 m brightness , which is a challenge for models to predict accurately ) .",
    "the psf of the mid - ir data has a full width at half maximum of @xmath12 , which is more than twice as large as that of the near - ir data .    to gain an appreciation of the severity and effects of blending",
    ", we performed a simple simulation .",
    "first , we picked an individual k@xmath9 band frame and removed all detected stars from it with daophot / allstar ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "next , we placed each of these stars back into the frame , at their original positions but using a @xmath12 psf to mimic the appearance at 3.6 @xmath11 m .",
    "we assumed that none of these stars have an infrared excess due to circumstellar dust , so their 3.6 @xmath11 m counts can be derived from their k@xmath9 magnitude by applying a typical k@xmath9[3.6 ] colour of a few tenths of a magnitude ( see figure 4 in van loon , marshall & zijlstra 2005 ) .",
    "then , we used daophot / allstar and daomaster to detect and photomeasure the stars on this pseudo-3.6 @xmath11 m frame .",
    "the distributions of input and recovered pseudo-3.6 @xmath11 m magnitudes ( fig.2 ) demonstrate that in the crowded central regions of m33 the 3.6 @xmath11 m photometry becomes severely incomplete for stars fainter than about magnitude 16 , well before the k@xmath9 band data .",
    "hence our simulation also accounts for unresolved emission at 3.6 @xmath11 m from stars too faint to be detected individually .",
    "the recovery rate of stars brighter than magnitude 16 is very high .",
    "stars brighter than magnitude 16 are recovered with reliable photometry , at an accuracy ( much ) better than 0.3 mag and showing no systematic offset ( fig.3 ) .",
    "visual inspection of the few bright sources with large photometric discrepancies revealed that most of these stars were located near the very nucleus of m33 or near the edge of the frame .",
    "stars fainter than magnitude 16 start showing the effects of blending , leading to a reduction in the number of stars that are recovered ( fig .  2 ) and a systematic over - estimation of their brightness ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "a useful number of stars ( 107 ) are detected at 8 @xmath11 m because of excess emission from circumstellar dust , which allows derivation of their mass - loss rates .",
    "the stars form a branch of increasing mid - ir brightness with increasing near-/mid - ir colour ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the brightest mid - ir objects , @xmath13<10 $ ] mag , with very red colours , ( @xmath14-[8])\\approx$ ] 5 mag , deviate from this main branch .",
    "these have not been identified by us as variable stars , and could be non - stellar in origin , for instance background galaxies or compact hii regions within m33 .",
    "we will come back to these and other deviant sources at the end of section 2.3 and in section 3.1 .",

    ". based on the estimated birth mass of the star ( see paper ii ) we used amorphous carbon dust ( hanner 1988 ) and a small amount of silicon carbide ( pgouri 1988 ) for @xmath24 , and astronomical silicates ( draine & lee 1984 ) for all other mass ranges , with a gas - to - dust mass ratio of @xmath25 . the optical depth ( @xmath15 )",
    "was varied and the luminosity ( @xmath26 ) was scaled until an acceptable match was obtained , which was decided by visual inspection .",
    "the optical depth and luminosity , and hence mass - loss rate ( @xmath27 ) , were determined for 58 carbon stars and 35 m - type stars ( table 1 ) ; examples are presented in figures 5 ( carbon stars ) and 6 ( m - type stars ) .    given the limited number of free parameters even a small number of data points constrain the model fit quite well . in all panels of figs .  5 and 6 we not only show the best fit for the preferred dust species but also that for the alternative dust species .",
    "while it is not always possible to tell , on the basis of the fit , which species of dust is present , the preferred dust species often yields better fits and hardly ever yields worse fits .",
    "our study spans several orders of magnitude in both mass - loss rate and luminosity , and the uncertainties resulting from the assumptions in the fitting procedures are thus relatively unimportant .",
    "a heavily dust - enshrouded pulsating giant star will still be fitted with a model with high optical depth regardless whether it employs carbonaceous or oxygenous dust .",
    "we do note , though , that often the 4.5-@xmath11 m datum is anomalously faint compared to adjacent bands .",
    "this may be due to molecular absorption , which was not included in our sed modelling .",
    "the fundamental ro - vibrational band of co at 4.6 @xmath11 m can be strong especially in the extended atmospheres of pulsating red giant stars ( cf .",
    "nowotny et al.2013 ) .",
    "the 3-@xmath11 m c@xmath28h@xmath28+hcn band is very strong in carbon stars , but it falls largely outside the irac 3.6-@xmath11 m bandpass ; the 3.8-@xmath11 m c@xmath28h@xmath28 band , while strong in metal - poor carbon stars ( van loon et al .  2006 , 2008 ) , is not expected to be nearly as strong in the carbon stars in the central regions of m33 that are of near - solar metallicity .    while this approach may seem crude ( by necessity ) , we shall see that the results compare favourably with those obtained for similar populations of stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the self - similarity of radiation - driven winds leads to scaling relations ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) , with the combination of @xmath29 being approximately constant .",
    "indeed it is , roughly , but with scatter ( @xmath30 dex ; fig .",
    "7 ) due to slight mis - matches between @xmath15 and @xmath31 to the exact shape of the sed .",
    "the amount of scatter is rather modest , though , and suggests that the mass - loss rates for these stars are accurate to well within a factor two ( cf .",
    "srinivasan , sargent & meixner ( 2011 ) ; the luminosities for these stars are obtained with an accuracy of around 1030 per cent ) .",
    "the offset between the carbon stars and m - type stars ( @xmath32 dex @xmath33 ) is expected as this is due primarily to the differences in opacity of the different dust species .",
    "most  though not all  stars originally classified as carbon stars but fitted with silicates end up in a location slightly off - set from that of the m - type stars .",
    "this suggests that most of these stars are indeed different from the m - type stars and therefore quite possibly genuine carbon stars , but that some may have been misclassified and are in fact m type .",
    ".parameterisations of relations between optical depth ( @xmath15 ) and near - ir colour ( @xmath34 ) of the form @xmath35 for @xmath36 mag ( and @xmath37 for @xmath38 mag ) .",

    "9 )  albeit with considerable scatter and with occasionally large deviations for h  k@xmath9 .",
    "this relation depends on the underlying star ( its temperature ) , and the carbon stars fitted with silicates fall in between carbon stars fitted with carbonaceous dust and m - type stars fitted with silicates ; this also drives the difference noted in figure 7 .",
    "luminosities are estimated for the sample at large by applying a parametrisation of the relation between bc@xmath40 and j ",

    "k@xmath9 if @xmath42 ( but not @xmath41 ) is available ( see table 3 ) . the scatter in fig .",
    "9 suggests that an accuracy in the luminosity is achieved of typically 3050 per cent .",
    "there exist pitfalls with this approach , which could lead to sources being erroneously assigned high luminosities and mass - loss rates .",
    "one such case comprises stars that have no j- or h - band counterpart because they are near to the edges of the survey area , or because they are heavily extincted by interstellar dust .",
    "such sources would not normally have been identified as variable in our survey .",
    "we thus decided that we would ignore stars that have no j- or h - band magnitude and are not variable .",
    "this includes the few very bright mid - ir sources mentioned at the end of section 2.2 , that are likely non - stellar in origin .",
    "when they have no j- or h - band magnitude but are variable , inspection of the brightest such sources revealed no suspicion regarding their photometry and so for these stars we do assign a j - band magnitude viz .",
    "equal to a ( conservative ) detection limit of @xmath43 mag . of just twelve such cases , the most extreme example is # 11887 : a large - amplitude variable ( @xmath44 mag ) , with luminosity @xmath45 and mass - loss rate @xmath46 .",
    "the mass - loss rate shows some dependence on luminosity ( fig .",
    "firstly , the highest rates are generally achieved by the most luminous , most massive stars , in agreement with earlier findings in the magellanic clouds ( van loon et al .",
    "1999 ; srinivasan et al .",
    "2009 ) . except for a few more extreme examples that would probably have been missed in our survey , carbon stars in the milky way reach mass - loss rates of a few @xmath47 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( whitelock et al .  2006 ) , whilst those in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) reach @xmath48 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( gullieuszik et al .",
    "2012 ) , i.e.comparable to the most extreme carbon stars in our m33 sample . in the solar neighbourhood ,",
    "m - type agb stars reach similar mass - loss rates , a few @xmath47 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( jura & kleinmann 1989 ) , whilst m - type supergiants display rates between @xmath49 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 with the majority in excess of a few @xmath50 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( jura & kleinmann 1990 ) , again both very similar to what we find in m33 .    much of the spread in mass - loss rate at a given luminosity is likely to reflect stellar evolution ( cf",
    ".  van loon et al .  1999 , 2005a ) .",
    "the least luminous carbon stars ( @xmath51 ) are probably not yet at the tip of their agb because m - type agb stars are found at the same luminosities but higher mass - loss rates  the latter are likely more evolved than the carbon stars ; but these carbon stars are not expected to become m - type again ( marigo et al.2008 ) so they must still evolve to higher luminosities before they end their agb evolution . with @xmath27 of a few @xmath50 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 they exhibit several times lower mass - loss rates than those near the tip of their agb evolution ( around @xmath52 l@xmath1 ) where they reach @xmath27 in excess of @xmath53 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the mass - loss rate increases as a star climbs the agb .    alternatively , the less luminous carbon stars with lower mass - loss rates may be in their inter - thermal pulse luminosity dip and/or the more luminous carbon stars with high mass - loss rates may just be experiencing the aftermath of a thermal pulse ( olofsson et al .",
    "1990 ; vassiliadis & wood 1993 ; mattsson , hfner & herwig 2007 ) .    fitting the stars that we originally classified as carbon stars with silicates generally yields higher mass - loss rates because of the lower specific opacity of silicates compared to amorphous carbon grains .",
    "one star , # 12831 ( @xmath54 mag , @xmath55 mag ) has in this way become one of the more extremely mass - losing objects , with @xmath56 nine times higher than if fitted with silicates .",
    "the inferred birth mass would now be 6.7 m@xmath1 .",
    "evolution of red supergiants is mostly in terms of effective temperature ( @xmath57 ) rather than luminosity .",
    "the dusty wind mass - loss rate depends sensitively on @xmath57 ( van loon et al .",
    "2005a ; cf .",
    "bonanos et al.2010 ) ; because red supergiants do not become as cool as massive agb stars the highest rates achieved by red supergiants fall a little behind those achieved by the most extreme agb stars considering that the red supergiants are more luminous ( fig .",
    "yet there is no luminosity gap in the stars with the highest mass - loss rates , confirming our earlier suggestion ( paper ii ) that super - agb stars become dust - enshrouded .",
    "super - agb stars are strictly speaking red supergiants .",
    "however , the most massive agb stars  i.e.  those that will _ not _ ignite core carbon burning  experience hot bottom burning ( hbb ; iben & renzini 1983 ) ; this not only prevents them from turning into carbon stars but also enhances their luminosity up and above the classical core - mass  luminosity relation ( boothroyd & sackmann 1992 ) .",
    "these stars may thus reach luminosities that exceed the classical agb limit ( indicated in fig .",
    "10 ) , making it difficult to distinguish between an agb star experiencing hbb and a super - agb star or red supergiant .",
    "they may separate in @xmath57@xmath26 diagrams ( van loon et al .",
    "2005a ) and thus also in @xmath58@xmath26 diagrams ( cf .",
    "wood et al .",
    "1992 ; whitelock et al .",
    "2003 ) and perhaps in @xmath27@xmath26 diagrams too .",
    "it is not very well established what is the maximum luminosity than can be reached under the influence of hbb , but it seems unlikely that it comprises much more than 50 per cent ( 0.2 dex ) . depending on the timing of the ensuing supernova explosion , red supergiants might be found in the dust - enshrouded phase , or a preceding or following phase characterised by a thinner dust envelope .",
    "but if super - agb stars explode they are likely to be dust - enshrouded , explaining explosions such as sn2008s ( botticella et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the sample of stars that were modelled with dusty is not complete , and we therefore include in figure 11 also the ukirt variable stars for which no _ spitzer _ photometry is available as well as non - variable stars .",
    "we note the most extreme datum in this graph , # 13093 , at @xmath59 and @xmath60 . with @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag",
    "it is consistent with being a heavily - reddened @xmath63 m@xmath1 supergiant ; we also identified it as a large - amplitude variable ( @xmath64 mag ) .",
    "our k@xmath9-band image shows a point source unaffected by crowding .",

    "photometry is available , neither from mcquinn et al .",

    "( 2009 ) . inspection of the irac images ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath11 m ) from the _ spitzer _ archive , however , clearly reveals the source , adding credence to it being an extremely dusty evolved star .",
    "it sits next to an extended area of mid - ir emission , though , which may explain why it was not measured .",
    "it is almost twice as bright at 8 @xmath11 m as the highest mass - losing ukirt variable that we modelled with dusty ( # 15552 ) , broadly in line with the factor 2.5 difference in their mass - loss rates .    on the other hand , the star with the next - highest mass - loss rate , # 12208 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is more suspicious . with @xmath67 mag",
    "it is bright , and with @xmath68 mag it is red , but its estimated k@xmath9-band amplitude is moderate ( @xmath69 mag ) .",
    "it is the brightest ukirt variable in this central region of m33 at 8 @xmath11 m , by far ( see fig .  4 ) . while it appears unresolved on the 8-@xmath11 m image it sits on top of more complex emission , within @xmath70 of a catalogued molecular cloud ( bolatto et al .",
    "2008 ) and a supernova remnant ( gordon et al.1999 ) ; this suggests it might be a young stellar object or even an ultra - compact hii region .",
    "a third object worth noting is the candidate @xmath71carin analogue m33 - 8 ( khan , stanek & kochanek 2012 ) .",
    "it is the only such object in their list of nine in m33 that ( just ) falls within our uist / ufti survey .",
    "they combined optical photometry with 2mass near - ir and _ spitzer _ mid - ir data , to derive the spectral energy distribution and luminosity .",
    "they show a _ hubble _ space telescope image in the visual dominated by a single source surrounded by a clustering of fainter stars .",
    "our ufti image reveals the dominant source is in fact a duplet in the k@xmath9 band , which would appear unresolved in the 2mass image .",
    "the uist catalogue lists them as # 18469 , with @xmath72 mag , and # 18441 , with @xmath73 mag .",
    "this compares well with the i - band magnitude ( 0.8 @xmath11 m ) listed in khan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) of @xmath74 mag .",
    "we estimate luminosities of @xmath75 and 3.68 , respectively ; i.e.  together they fall well short of accounting for the integrated ir luminosity of @xmath76 derived by khan et al",
    ". the latter must include significant contributions from other sources , especially as it includes the 24-@xmath11 m _ spitzer _ emission which has an angular resolution of only @xmath70 .",
    "we derive mass - loss rates of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for # 18469 and # 18441 , respectively ; substantial , but not extreme .",
    "close pairs of infrared - bright stars are not unique . for instance , # 19002 is an unresolved blend of two roughly equally - bright stars .",
    "we assigned a luminosity of @xmath79 and @xmath80 to the blended object ; certainly at least one of the two stars is very dusty .    the mass - loss rate increases with increasing k@xmath9-band amplitude ( fig.12 ) .",
    "the correlation is quite clear in spite of the relative inaccuracy of the amplitudes ( determined from sparsely sampled lightcurves ; see paper i ) .",
    "the correlation is consistent with a rle for stellar pulsation in driving the winds from cool stars ; it also confirms that , whilst the _ relative _ amplitudes ( expressed in magnitudes ) are smaller for more luminous stars ( the m - type stars with @xmath81 m@xmath1 are the most luminous , those with @xmath82 m@xmath1 are generally the least luminous ) , for the same amplitude the mass - loss rates are higher for more luminous stars : mass loss is more directly related to the _ absolute _ amplitude ( expressed in luminosity units ) ( van loon et al .",
    "the k@xmath9 band is relatively insensitive to variations in stellar temperature , circumstellar extinction and dust emission as it is near the peak of the stellar sed and in between the strong attenuation by dust at shorter wavelengths and its emission at longer wavelengths  hence also the preference for expressing bolometric corrections in relation to the k or k@xmath9 band .",
    "however , it is important , but difficult in practice , to separate the effects of pulsation and temperature on mass loss , as both the pulsation strengthens and the temperature decreases as the star ascends the rgb , agb or red supergiant branch ( see whitelock , feast & pottasch 1987 ) .",
    "the carbon stars confirm this picture in the sense that their amplitudes are intermediate between the more and less luminous m - type stars , but their mass - loss rates seem a little lower . as expected , the mass - loss rates of presumed carbon stars when fitted with silicates fall in between those of low - mass and higher - mass m - type stars .",
    "this fact neither confirms nor refutes their carbon star nature .",
    "mass - loss rates have often been correlated with infrared colour , to provide a simple recipe for converting infrared colours to mass - loss rates ; however , these methods depend on the star s luminosity as well as the dust properties ( see van loon 2007 for a review ) .",
    "figure 13 exemplifies this once more : the carbon stars become easily reddened by their dust but that does not necessarily imply as high a mass - loss rate as a less reddened m - type star . likewise , among stars with similar dust the less luminous stars are more readily reddened than more luminous ones ( van loon et al .",
    "thus , care must be taken when converting an infrared colour into a mass - loss rate .",
    "the carbon stars luminosities are intermediate between those of the low - mass and higher - mass m - type stars , and indeed their mass - loss rates fall in between those groups mass - loss rates if also the presumed carbon stars are fitted with silicates .",
    "assessments of the integrated mass loss ( or dust production ) from a stellar population are fraught with uncertainties . in small populations ,",
    "stochastic effects are caused by very small numbers of stars which may dominate the budget ( van loon et al .",
    "2005b ; mcdonald et al .",
    "2009 ) , but it is also difficult to accurately account for the many stars that each contribute little .",
    "most red giants undergo mild mass loss and their circumstellar envelopes are not very dusty ; photometric tracers of this mass loss and dust will be affected by photometric uncertainties and scatter in interstellar reddening , as well as uncertainties in the underlying photospheric spectral energy distribution ( cf .",
    "mcdonald , zijlstra & boyer 2012 ) .",
    "interstellar reddening towards the central region of m33 is modest ( see paper i ) ; whilst it is negligible for the dustiest stars it may lead to an over - estimate of the amount of dust produced by stars with little mass loss .",
    "photometric scatter will also cause some stars to appear to have more dust than they really do , but equally cause the opposite effect in others .",
    "as this is of a purely statistical nature we can try to compensate for it by considering the distribution of stars over negative values for the optical depth as one would have derived them from the near - ir colour relation ( fig .",
    "14 , top ) .",
    "a similar distribution of erroneous optical depth values would extent towards positive values , and this distribution can be subtracted to yield the true distribution over optical depth ( fig .  14 , bottom ) .",
    "the fraction of stars that were identified to be variable increases with increasing optical depth , to about unity for the most obscured specimens ( fig .",
    "this is encouraging , suggesting that the dustiest stars produced most of that dust themselves .",
    "we can not be certain , however , that the dust inferred for the non - variables and/or less obscured stars was all produced by themselves .    because the mass - loss and dust - loss rate is derived from the optical depth via scaling with the luminosity ,",
    "correcting the mass return is not straightforward .",
    "this correction can be applied statistically in two ways : ( 1 ) by reducing the contribution from each star by a factor @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the distributions before and after correcting for the symmetric distribution around @xmath37 , where @xmath86 for @xmath87 ; or ( 2 ) by including all stars including those with @xmath87 , and assigning negative mass - loss rates to the latter .",
    "the problem with the second method is that some stars with very negative values and/or very high luminosities could make a large difference to the end result , whereas in the first method the correction is `` smoother '' . on the other hand , the second method accounts , to some extent , for variations of the correction factor with luminosity",
    "should such dependence exist . in what follows",
    "we have adopted the second method .",
    "hence we obtain the binned and cumulative mass - loss rate distributions depicted in figure 15 .",
    "we concentrate on the mass - loss rates of the ukirt variable stars , as these are believed to contribute the majority of the mass loss , but we also show the result including the non - variable stars  which are dominated by the low - mass red giants . the latter are numerous and therefore appear to contribute several times as much as the intermediate - mass agb stars and higher - mass red supergiants , but it must be remembered that interstellar dust will be more often the cause of their generally modest reddening and so that result must be regarded as a firm upper limit to the mass return , of @xmath88 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( or @xmath89 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 if all carbon stars are actually m - type stars )",
    ". the true mass - return rate must be closer to that derived from the ukirt variable stars , @xmath90 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( or @xmath91 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 if all carbon stars are actually m - type stars ) . accepting that some of the mass loss might have been missed  as not all variable stars may have been recognised in our survey  we could conceive a total mass - return rate of @xmath40.01 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( up to @xmath92 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 if a large fraction of the carbon stars are actually m - type stars ) . given the assumptions and uncertainties inherent to the mass - loss determinations we could hardly claim a higher degree of accuracy .",
    "that said , low - mass m - type agb stars appear to make a similar contribution to the mass return in the central regions of m33 as all more massive stars combined . among the latter ,",
    "the massive carbon stars and red supergiants make similar contributions , while the low - mass carbon stars and massive agb stars contribute less . as a result",
    ", the present - day mass - return arises mainly from stars formed in one of three major episodes : @xmath93 myr ago ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath951 gyr ago ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath9710 gyr ago ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this mainly reflects the star formation history ( paper ii ) .",
    "the contribution from the intermediate - age population , formed @xmath951 gyr ago , is larger if the presumed carbon stars are actually mostly m - type stars , in which case they account for about half of the total mass return .",
    "it is worthy of note that carbon grains make up @xmath99% of the present - day dust - mass return , i.e.  the interstellar dust is predominantly oxygen - rich .",
    "this fraction becomes even smaller if the population of carbon stars was overestimated .",
    "the radial profile of the mass return rate ( fig .",
    "16 , in terms of surface density deprojected onto the galaxy plane ",
    "see paper ii ) is flat within the inner @xmath100 kpc for the carbon stars .",
    "there appears to be a clear radial gradient for the m - type stars , with the mass return greatest within the central few hundred pc , but large deviations occur around @xmath1010.4 kpc .",
    "a more complete picture is obtained from the full 2-d map of mass return ( fig .",
    "17 , _ not _ deprojected ) , where a smooth level of gas and dust injection underlies dramatic local enhancements due to the concentration of red supergiants ( and super - agb stars ) near to their sites of formation in discrete molecular cloud complexes .",
    "one of these includes # 13093 and # 12208 , the supergiants with the highest mass - loss rates ( see section 3.1 ) . for comparison",
    "we show a _ spitzer _",
    "composite in the left panel of figure 17  note the bright source at ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) : this is m33 - 8 ( kahn et al .",
    "2012 ; see section 3.1 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of mass return does not change markedly if the carbon stars turn out to be mostly m - type stars .",
    "if we believe the model predictions for the duration of the pulsation phase ( @xmath104 , see table 2 in paper ii and marigo et al .  2008 ) then we can calculate the mass lost during the pulsation phase as a fraction of the birth mass if we sample this phase both randomly and sufficiently : @xmath105 obviously , this ratio should be less than unity .",
    "it is therefore somewhat disconcerting to find that this is not the case ( fig .",
    "18 ) , though it does lend support to our belief that the non - variable stars can not contribute much to the total mass - loss budget , or it would seriously aggravate the situation . the integrated mass - loss along the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars",
    "is strongly constrained by the initial  final mass relation determined from white dwarfs in stellar clusters .",
    "the ratio of our values to those derived from the initial  final mass relation from williams , bolte & koester ( 2009 ) varies between @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for massive stars",
    "the situation is more uncertain ; while most of them ( at the lower mass end ) will leave behind a neutron star ( of order a tenth of their birth mass ) it is unclear how much mass is lost as a red supergiant , as a blue supergiant , and during the supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , ekstrm et al .",
    "but what causes the discrepancy ? have the mass - loss rates been over - estimated ? or is the pulsation duration in error ?",
    "if the pulsation duration was over - estimated , then the star formation rate would have been under - estimated . at the time",
    ", we compared our estimate of the recent star formation rate , @xmath1080.007 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 , with work by wilson , scoville & rice ( 1991 ) who had derived @xmath109 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 .",
    "we were satisfied that , within the inherent uncertainties , these two estimates were consistent . in light of the above discrepancy between birth mass and lost mass , though , we now revisit these estimates :    * it is reasonable to assume that star formation occurs within the gas - rich disc , and so the recent star formation rate ought to be deprojected onto the galaxy s plane .",
    "this depresses the rate by a factor @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the angle of inclination of the normal to the m33 disc with respect to the line - of - sight , for which we take @xmath112 ( zaritsky et al .",
    "the fact that the survey area is square but the position angle is @xmath113 matters , but not a lot .",
    "so our estimate for the recent star formation rate becomes @xmath114 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 .",
    "* several other groups have estimated star formation rates for the central region of m33 ( as part of larger surveys ) , from h@xmath115 emission or the luminosity in the far - ultraviolet or far - infrared ( hippelein et al.2003 ; engargiola et al .  2003 ; heyer et al .",
    "2004 ; gardan et al .",
    "2007 ; boissier et al .  2007 ; verley et al .",
    "kang et al .  (",
    "2012 ) have summarised these works and they determine @xmath116 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 within the central square kpc of m33 , but possibly as much as 0.030.04 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 ( heyer et al .  2004 ) .",
    "this is @xmath117 times higher than our estimate .",
    "if we shorten the pulsation duration ( as used in paper ii ) by this factor , then the fractional mass - loss of stars with masses @xmath81 m@xmath1 ( @xmath118 ) becomes @xmath119 .",
    "this reconciles the estimated mass - loss rates and star formation rates , given that some additional mass will be lost by the most massive stars as blue supergiants and supernov .",
    "now that we have regained some confidence in the estimated values of the star formation rate and mass - return rate , we can consider the balance between the ism depletion and replenishment .",
    "kang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) estimated an ism depletion timescale of @xmath120 gyr . but this does not take into account the continuous mass return by evolved stars , which would lengthen the depletion timescale . our estimated mass - return rate ( after deprojection ) of @xmath1210.005 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 ( up to 0.01 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3",
    "if all carbon stars are actually m - type stars ) is more than our initially estimated recent star formation rate of @xmath122 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 , but lower than the star formation rate estimated by other groups .",
    "we have just argued that our estimate of the star formation rate needs to be scaled up by a factor @xmath117 , which would mean that the mass - return rate falls short of supplying the fuel for continued star formation by a factor 6 or 7 ( or 3 , if all carbon stars are actually m - type stars ) .",
    "the naive estimate of the depletion timescale of 0.3 gyr would not change by more than 17% as a result of this mass return  and by at most 50% if all carbon stars turn out to be m - type stars .",
    "however , additional mass is returned by supernov , hot massive - star winds , luminous blue variable eruptions , et cetera .",
    "most of these contributions come from massive stars , which contribute about one third to the mass returned through dusty stellar winds ( see fig .",
    "15 , top right panel ) . their fractional mass - loss ( after correction for the shorter pulsation duration ) is @xmath0% , i.e.  they could at most contribute @xmath123 times as much as estimated here ( accounting also for stellar remnants being left behind ) , which would increase the total mass - return rate ( across all stellar masses ) from @xmath1240.005 to @xmath4 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath3 .",
    "note that the contribution from low - mass stars is already fully accounted for by the dusty stellar winds .",
    "thus , the above conclusion does not change , namely that the rate at which the ism is replenished by stellar mass loss falls short by a factor @xmath125 to sustain star formation at the current rate .",
    "this conclusion does not change if all carbon stars turn out to be m - type stars , though the discrepancy is reduced to a factor @xmath126 . for star formation to continue beyond",
    "the next few hundred myr gas must flow into the central regions of m33 , either through a viscous disc or via cooling flows from the circum - galactic medium .",
    "the mass return is not uniform across the central square kpc , so locally the above conclusions might not be accurate .",
    "the mass return by low - mass stars and carbon stars is fairly uniform across the area , with a slight radial gradient .",
    "but there are three areas at @xmath1010.4 kpc from the centre where the mass - return rate is much higher due to the contribution of several massive , very dusty stars",
    ". this could feed  and chemically enrich  enduring or new star formation in those areas on timescales of a couple of @xmath127 yr .    in paper",
    "ii we had found that the star formation rate peaks within the central @xmath128 kpc .",
    "the very centre of m33 , while characterised by high levels of mass return is not where the ism is replenished at the highest rate .",
    "however , if gas from the dense regions at @xmath1010.4 kpc can be accreted into the nucleus of m33 then this could be a mechanism for star formation to occur even within the nuclear star cluster .",
    "indeed , tosaki et al .  ( 2011 ) find the molecular gas peaks at @xmath129 kpc from the centre , and this could have been supplied at somewhat greater distances before being channeled towards the nucleus .",
    "they find another peak at @xmath130 kpc which is at the edge of our survey area .",
    "the offsets of the peaks in the dense ism with respect to the peaks in mass return ( and star formation ) suggest that , globally , there is a delay as well as a migration between the epochs and sites of intense mass return , accumulation of dense ism , and star formation .",
