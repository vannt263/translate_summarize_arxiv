    "in 2002 , the ligo scientific collaboration and the ligo laboratory organized the first science data run ( s1 ) .",
    "the collaboration took data for 17 days , between 23 august and 9 september , using the three ligo detectors ( two detectors in the hanford observatory and one detector in the livingston observatory ) , and the geo detector in hannover , germany .",
    "the detectors had not achieved their aimed sensitivities , and were at different completion levels with respect to their configurations , as described in @xcite .",
    "however , the noise level of at least some of the detectors was low enough to make them sensitive to inspiraling binary neutron stars in the galaxy , and even the magellanic clouds , making the data taking and analysis effort worthwhile and competitive with previous searches that produced upper limits on the rate of inspiraling binary neutron sources in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the analysis of s1 ligo data looking for gravitational waves from binary neutron stars were described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this article reports on some of the details of the data analysis done in @xcite , on the results obtained , and on some of the lessons learned that will lead to improved methods in the analysis of present and future science runs . at the time of writing ,",
    "the collaboration is analyzing the data from another 2-month science run , and is preparing to take data again with another 60 + days long run at the end of 2003 .",
    "a typical amplitude spectral density of the ligo detectors noise during s1 , interpreted as strain , is shown in fig .",
    "[ s1asd ] . we can translate the noise spectral density into an optimal range , defined as the maximum distance at which a binary neutron star system , if optimally oriented and located , would be detected with a signal - to - noise ratio of 8 . in average ,",
    "the optimal range for the livingston detector during s1 was 176 kpc , and for the hanford 4 km detector , 46 kpc .",
    "the optimal range for the 2 km hanford detector was slightly worse than for the 4 km detector , and the data quality was not as good ; the range for the geo detector for the same sources was significantly worse .",
    "we then decided to use only data from the ligo 4 km detectors , which we call l1 ( livingston detector ) and h1 ( hanford detector ) .",
    "seismic noise at the livingston observatory limited operations during most weekdays , so the overall l1 duty cycle during s1 was 42% ( 170 hours of data ) , while the duty cycle of h1 was 58% ( 235 hours ) .",
    "the time when the two detectors h1 and l1 were in operation amounted to 116 hours , representing a duty cycle of only 28% .",
    "we decided to analyze _ all _ of the data available from l1 and h1 , including the times when a single detector was available . while we were not going to be able to confirm through coincidence the candidate events found when only one detector was operating , in this way we have more statistics to use for upper limit analysis and for testing our data analysis method . in the future , with longer science runs and",
    "improved duty cycles , we will be able to achieve good upper limits on astrophysical rates using only times when more than one detector is in operation .",
    "the scientific goal of the data analysis exercise was to set an upper limit on the rate of binary neutron star systems in the galaxy .",
    "we did not observe any coincident event with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) larger than 6.5 in both detectors ; thus , we had no candidates for detection .    in order to get an upper limit on the event rate",
    ", we measure the efficiency of the detectors ( and the search method ) to the population we are sensitive to ( milky way galaxy , large and small magellanic clouds ) , and infer the upper limit rate in that population from the efficiency as a function of signal - to - noise @xmath0 and the amount of time analyzed @xmath1 .",
    "the result is an observational , frequentist , upper limit of 170 events / year per milky way equivalent galaxy ( mweg ) , with 90% confidence , on the coalescence rate of binary systems in which each component has a mass in the range 1 - 3 m@xmath2 .    a rough estimate of what could be expected from the analysis shows that our result was close to expectations . at snr=16 ( the snr of our strongest surviving candidate ) , l1 was , in average , sensitive to 90% of the sources in the galaxy , while h1 was sensitive to 40% of the same population .",
    "l1 was operating for 170 hours in s1 , while h1 provided an additional 119 hours operating without l1 in coincidence .",
    "the total of available hours was then 289 hours .",
    "the maximum efficiency expected was then @xmath3 .",
    "an upper limit on the event rate for the galaxy is then expected at the level of @xmath4 100 events / yr . this is considerably smaller than the actual upper limit obtained of 170 events / yr .",
    "this was due to several reasons : not all the data was used because of availability , calibration problems or poor data quality ; there was some loss of efficiency due to requirements on matching templates and on consistency under coincidence ; and we used the upper bound in our rate estimate given the uncertainties in the results .",
    "of course , even an optimally calculated event rate would be far from other astrophysical estimates which suggest rates of @xmath5/yr for our galaxy@xcite .",
    "typical sensitivities of the ligo detectors during s1.,height=288 ]",
    "we developed a pipeline to analyze the data that could lead to detection during times when the two detectors were in operation , but also analyzed the data when a single detector was in operation .",
    "if this pipeline had resulted in a strong candidate appearing in both detectors , consistent with a coincident signal , we would have followed up with additional investigations to determine its origin , either astrophysical or instrumental . in s1 ,",
    "our analysis did not find any such coincident event . in the absence of detection , we take several more steps to produce , from the list of candidates , an observational upper limit on the rate of events in the galaxy .",
    "we describe now the different elements leading to our resulting rate of 170 events / yr / mweg .",
    "the pipeline and details on the methods used for each step are described in detail in @xcite ; here we summarize the steps and point out possible improvements to apply in the analysis of future data .",
    "the pipeline has several parameters that were tuned to obtain the best upper limit possible .",
    "since biases could be introduced by this tuning , we performed the optimization on a selected data set , called the `` playground '' .",
    "this playground , about 10% of the data in coincidence , was not used in the final analysis .",
    "the playground times were chosen by hand , trying to choose locked segments that were representative of the different data quality over the run . however , a fair representation was difficult to obtain with such an ad - hoc procedure , and for the next science run ( s2 , jan 14-apr 14 2003 ) , an automatic procedure was implemented .    in the first step in our pipeline ,",
    "we analyze the interferometer data from each detector using matched filtering , with a template bank chosen to guarantee coverage of the worst detector @xcite ( and thus producing overcoverage of the better detector ) .",
    "the matched filtering makes critical use of the detector data calibration : we lost about 25 hours , or 9% of available data , due to missing calibration information .",
    "we also lost 39 hours , or 13% , due to the granularity of the matched filtering jobs , which required blocks of time 256 seconds long , and thus could not use short segments , or times at the end of segments .",
    "we expect to improve both of these numbers with better practice ( for calibration ) , and better instrument stability ( for longer operating segments ) .",
    "we used a single template bank for both detectors , for all times in s1 . in future runs",
    ", we will use different banks , dynamically adapted to the noise in the detector in the segment of continuous lock being analyzed .",
    "when the snr of a particular candidate is larger than 6.5 , we calculate a quality - of - fit parameter ( similar to a @xmath6 , but adapted to the limitations placed by a finite template bank ) , and tune a cut on this parameter .",
    "this cut , although very powerful , was found not to veto candidates that upon further inspection were happening during noisy times .",
    "we are now developing methods that will analyze the time before the candidate template starts , either looking for excitations of other templates ( typical during noisy times ) , or looking for lack of consistency with a stationary noise background .",
    "the second step in the pipeline applied two kind of instrumental vetoes to the surviving triggers : an epoch cut , and an instrumental veto for h1 .",
    "the epoch cut was adopted by the two working groups looking for signals of short duration ( bursts and inspiral sources ) , and eliminated times when the noise in certain frequency bands was well outside typical noise levels during s1 , trended over 6 minute periods .",
    "this cut removed 8% of the l1 data , and 18% of the h1 data . in spite of the non - negligible amount of data eliminated",
    ", we did not have a satisfactory explanation on the reasons why the noise was excessively high at these times .",
    "this was in part due to the lack of time to diagnose the noise sources : the instruments are constantly changing , except during the data taking run itself .",
    "this makes the diagnostics of particular data features very difficult , especially if attempted long after the instrument has changed character .",
    "we hope the understanding of the instrument will be better when we reach a stationary ( and satisfactory ) noise level , but probably not earlier .",
    "the second instrumental veto was due to coupling of frequency noise glitches in h1 , as seen in another interferometer channel simultaneously with triggers in the gravitational wave channel .",
    "we had similar efficient veto channels for l1 ( which also had a much higher event rate of accidental triggers ) , but we decided not to use them because when injecting hardware signals to simulate gravitational waves , they also excited the auxiliary channels in ways that could produce `` vetoes '' .",
    "we expect that with better understanding of the physical nature of the vetoes , we will be able to find efficient , safe vetoes that will eliminate the candidate events produced by instrumental artifacts .",
    "the third step involves only the candidate triggers in l1 surviving the template matching and instrumental vetoes applied , and which are strong enough to show up in h1 with snr@xmath76.5 . to these events",
    ", we apply a coincidence veto if the are no consistent triggers in h1 and l1 .",
    "however , there were no such events in the s1 data : only triggers in l1 which appeared closer than 51 kpc would have possibly appeared as candidates in h1 ; but the strongest candidate event we had during coincident times had an apparent distance of 68 kpc . during s1 ,",
    "we were logistically limited in the number of triggers generated , thus imposing a lower limit of snr looked for as 6.5 .",
    "thus , the lower limit in snr for the noisier detector sets up a much stricter snr criterion in the less noisy detector . to overcome this problem without overloading the database with low snr events , we plan to implement a hierarchical search , looking for low snr in the less sensitive detector only around times when a large snr event is found in the more sensitive detector .",
    "the final step in the pipeline generating the list of candidates involved maximizing all surviving triggers over time and over the template bank , to improve the timing resolution , and the confidence in the snr of the candidate .",
    "this pipeline analyzed a total of 236 hours .",
    "to measure the efficiency of our pipeline , we injected in software simulated signals , following the sample population for spatial and mass distributions from a milky way population produced by the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the spatial distribution described in ref .",
    "@xcite . since l1 was sensitive to sources at a distance slightly larger than our galaxy , we added sources from the large and small magellanic clouds , treating them as points at their known distances and sky positions .",
    "these systems contributed about 11% and 2% of the rate of the simulated signals , respectively .",
    "the total number of injected signals totaled more than 5000 .",
    "the efficiency is also measured as a function of snr : at each snr , we measure the number of simulated sources in our model at the corresponding distance or closer .",
    "we measured an efficiency of 80% for snr@xmath78 , and 53% for snr=15.9 , that of our loudest surviving candidate .      in principle",
    ", we would like our pipeline to produce some non - zero rate of candidate events as a function of threshold snr , and compare that with an estimated accidental rate at the same snr .",
    "the background rate can be measured by time - shift analysis , which guarantees that any coincidence is accidental .",
    "however , our pipeline did not result in _ any _ event for which coincidence timing criteria could be applied , making this method for estimating the background impossible .",
    "for single detector data , no such reliable estimate of the background can be performed : we just have a list of candidates which we can not confirm or veto through coincidence .",
    "assuming the true sources have a poisson distribution with rate @xmath8 , then the probability @xmath9 of observing a signal with snr=@xmath10 in a time of observation @xmath1 , with the efficiency of the detector and method as a function of snr given by @xmath0 , is @xmath11 . given a list of candidate events with maximum snr=@xmath12 , we interpret that with confidence level @xmath9 , the rate is not larger than @xmath13 , or @xmath14 for 90% confidence .",
    "given our largest snr=15.9 surviving in the l1-only pipeline , our measured efficiency @xmath15 to the simulated population , and our runtime @xmath1=236 hr , we obtain a rate @xmath16 events / year .",
    "if we express the efficiency to sources in our galaxy , comprising 88.5% of the population considered , we obtain an upper limit on the rate of 140 events / year / milky way equivalent galaxy .",
    "we have + 14%/-10% uncertainties in the efficiency , mostly due to calibration uncertainties , and 5% uncertainties in the population estimates ; we choose to state the obtained upper limit as the higher bound in our rate estimate , or 170 events / year / mweg .",
    "for the first time , we used data from coincident interferometric detectors to look for signals from binary inspiraling neutron star systems .",
    "we did not find any signal with snr@xmath76.5 while the two ligo detectors were in operation .",
    "we used the data to set upper limits on the possible rates of inspirals in our galaxy .",
    "these are very important successful milestones in the first steps towards the data analysis of interferometric data , and we have learned many important lessons from the exercise which we plan to use in the future analysis of science runs .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the ligo project and the ligo science collaboration , who made the first ligo scientific run possible . this work was supported by nsf grant phy-0135389 .",
