    "one of the main ingredients necessary to study few - body nuclear systems is a realistic description of the nuclear interaction .",
    "a number of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) potentials has been determined in the recent years . they all reproduce the deuteron binding energy and fit a large set of @xmath1 scattering data below the pion - production threshold with a @xmath2/datum of about 1 . among these potentials",
    ", we will consider in the present study only the `` phenomenological '' model of ref .",
    "@xcite ( av18 ) , and a model based on chiral symmetry derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( n3lo - idaho ) . among the many features of these two models , we note only that the av18 is a local @xmath1 potential model , with a strong short - range repulsion and tensor component , while the n3lo - idaho is a non - local @xmath1 potential model , with a softer short - range repulsion and tensor component than the av18 . as a consequence of these differences , it is interesting to test these potential models studying light nuclear systems . in these systems , a further contribution to the realistic nuclear hamiltonian model comes from the three - nucleon interaction ( tni ) .",
    "several models of tni s have been proposed .",
    "they are mainly based on the exchange of pions among the three nucleons , as the urbana ix ( uix ) tni  @xcite , which will be considered in the present study .",
    "the more recent tni models studied within the chiral approach  @xcite and the extension of the uix model known as the illinois tni  @xcite will be considered in a near future .",
    "a second crucial ingredient in the study of light nuclear systems is the technique used to solve the @xmath0-body schrdinger equation .",
    "several methods have been developed in the past years ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . among them",
    ", we consider in the present study the technique known as the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) method , which will be briefly described in the following section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , the results for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering lengths will be presented and compared with the available experimental data .",
    "the nuclear wave function for an @xmath0-body system can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a suitable complete set of states , and @xmath7 is an index denoting the set of quantum numbers necessary to completely determine the basis elements . in the present work ,",
    "the functions @xmath6 have been written in terms of hh functions both in configuration - space or in momentum - space  @xcite .",
    "the unknown coefficients @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) are obtained applying the rayleigh - ritz ( kohn ) variational principle for the bound ( scattering ) state problem .",
    "then , the matrix elements of the different operators of the hamiltonian are calculated , working in coordinate- or in momentum - space depending on what is more convenient .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to an eigenvalue - eigenvector problem ( system of algebraic linear equations ) , which can be solved with standard numerical techniques  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 doublet and quartet scattering lengths obtained with the non - local n3lo - idaho  @xcite @xmath1 interaction , with or without the inclusion of the uix tni  @xcite , are given in table 1 , and compared with the available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "also shown are the results obtained with the local av18  @xcite @xmath1 interaction and the av18/uix potential model for a comparison  @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of the n3lo - idaho / uix model , the parameter in front of the spin - isospin independent part of the uix tni has been rescaled by a factor of 0.384 to fit the triton binding energy . in this way , the triton , @xmath9he , and @xmath10he binding energies are 8.481 mev , 7.730 mev , and 28.534 mev , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the n3lo - idaho and n3lo - idaho / uix results shown in the table are accurate at the 10@xmath11 fm level .",
    "in fact , the convergence of the hh expansion has been tested with a procedure similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0=3 and 4 bound states observables .",
    "from inspection of the table we can conclude that : ( i ) both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quartet scattering lengths are very little model - dependent . also , they are not affected by the inclusion of the tni .",
    "the trend shown by the av18 and av18/uix results has been found also in the case of the non - local n3lo - idaho and n3lo - idaho / uix potential models .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath3 doublet scattering length is very sensitive to the choice of the @xmath1 potential model , when no tni is included .",
    "however , once the tni is included , and therefore the triton binding energy is well reproduced , @xmath12 becomes model - independent .",
    "this is a well - known feature , related to the fact that @xmath12 and the triton binding energy are linearly correlated ( the so - called phillips line  @xcite ) .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath4 doublet scattering length is positive and quite model - dependent , if only the two - nucleon interaction is included .",
    "once the tni is added , @xmath13 becomes very little and negative .",
    "some model - dependence remains , but the problem of extrapolating to zero energy the experimental results makes impossible any meaningful comparison between theory and experiment .    in conclusion , the application of the hh method to treat the low - energy scattering problem using non - local @xmath1 interactions has been found successful .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems have been considered , with the full inclusion of the coulomb interaction , in the second case .",
    "a similar investigation for the @xmath0=4 scattering lengths has been reported in ref .",
    ". further work at higher energies is currently underway ."
