    "observations of the inhomogeneities and anisotropies of the universe s large scale structure and of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are one of the keys to decipher the cosmic evolution . according to the favoured cosmological scenario ,",
    "fluctuations of matter and space - time are generated during an early epoch of inflation .",
    "the ability to predict the power spectra of cosmological perturbations for a large variety of different inflationary models is of the utmost importance .",
    "so far , all predictions that come up to the level of accuracy needed for cmb experiments such as archeops , map or planck , have to rely on the slow - roll approximation , subject to an infinite number of convergence conditions , or on numerical integration @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new method that overcomes the mentioned restrictions ( but has its own , very different ones ) .",
    "our method is applicable to models that can not be described by the slow - roll approximation ( e.g. the ` problem of a large slow - roll parameter @xmath1 ' of some supersymmetry - inspired inflationary models ) and it can be applied to small scales that leave the horizon at times close to the end of inflation , where the slow - roll approximation necessarily has to break down .",
    "the study of scalar and tensor fluctuations can be reduced to the study of a single variable during inflation , usually denoted by @xmath2 or @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are similar to the schrdinger equation for a one - dimensional system : @xmath4\\mu   = \\frac{{\\rm d}^2}{{\\rm d}\\eta ^2}\\mu + \\omega ^2(\\eta ) \\mu   = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] where , in the cosmological context , the conformal time @xmath1 plays the role of the radial variable @xmath5 in atomic physics . in general",
    ", this equation can not be solved exactly unless very simple potentials @xmath6 are considered and one has to rely on a method of approximation .",
    "however , we have inherited a very powerful method to deal with more complicated potentials from the pioneers of quantum mechanics , namely the wentzel ",
    "kramers  brillouin ( wkb ) method of approximation .    in this article",
    ", we apply this method to the equation governing the evolution of cosmological perturbations .",
    "it is quite astonishing that for more than twenty years since the discovery of cosmological inflation , to our knowledge , nobody has been able to apply successfully the wkb approximation to the prediction of cosmological perturbations .",
    "this is probably related to the fact that the growth of the perturbations on superhorizon scales , which is equivalent , in the quantum - mechanical version of the theory , to particles creation , is often described in terms of the breakdown of the wkb approximation . in this article , we demonstrate that this is true only if the wkb approximation is used naively .",
    "in fact , the problem bears a close resemblance with the situation discussed by atomic physicists at the time quantum mechanics was born .",
    "we therefore make a historical digression to illustrate the main point of the present article .",
    "the subject debated by the atomic physicists at the beginning of the twentieth century was the application of the wkb approximation to the motion in a central field of force and , more specifically , how the balmer formula , for the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms , can be recovered within the wkb approximation .",
    "the effective frequency for hydrogenic atoms is given by ( obviously , in the atomic physics context , the wave equation is not a differential equation with respect to time but to the radial coordinate @xmath5 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ( attractive ) central charge and @xmath9 the quantum number of angular momentum .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 denotes the energy of the particle and is negative in the case of a bound state .",
    "the calculation of the energy levels was first addressed by kramers @xcite and by young and uhlenbeck @xcite .",
    "the method employed was sommerfeld s quantization rule @xmath11 where the integral must be calculated along the classical trajectory given here by an ellipse .",
    "the result obtained by those authors reads @xmath12^{1/2 } \\biggr\\}^{-2}\\ , .\\ ] ] in addition , the wkb wave function for small values of @xmath5 was found to behave as @xmath13^{1/2}+1/2}$ ] .",
    "this last result follows straightforwardly if one retains only the last term in eq .",
    "( [ omeh ] ) , i.e. @xmath14^{1/2}/r$ ] , as required in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "it was noticed by young and uhlenbeck that the two previous results are not satisfactory . indeed ,",
    "experimental results indicate that the factor @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ elevel ] ) should be replaced by @xmath17 : `` _ it is apparent that we do not obtain the familiar balmer formula except in the limit of large @xmath18 values . if , however , we replace @xmath16 by @xmath19 the correct result is obtained_. '' a similar remark is made in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the behaviour of the wave function near the origin : `` _ the approximate solution based upon the negative exponential behaves for @xmath5 very small like @xmath20^{1/2}+1/2}$ ] .",
    "again the replacement of @xmath16 by @xmath19 leads to an agreement between the approximate and exact solutions_. '' the solution advocated by young and uhlenbeck was therefore to replace , by hand , @xmath16 by @xmath21 without further theoretical justifications .    in @xmath22",
    "the problem was considered again by langer  @xcite . in the section devoted to the radial wave equation ,",
    "he notices that the wkb approximation was applied to the schrdinger equation ( [ osci ] ) by kramers , young and uhlenbeck only because of its resemblance with the equation of an oscillator : `` _ insofar as the writer is aware , the degree of this resemblance has hitherto been regarded without exception as sufficient for assuming the out - and - out applicability to the equation ( 17 ) of the formulas deduced in the foregoing discussion , especially of the formula ( 14 ) _ , '' where eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 14 ) in langer s paper correspond to eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) and the wkb connection formula .",
    "he also remarks that no theoretical explanation has been given to explain why the wrong factor @xmath16 is obtained : `` _ this `` failure '' of the wkb method , i.e.  to the extent that the change in question is requisite , has been generally verified both in studies of attractive and repulsive fields .",
    "no explanation of it seems to have been given , though that can be done very simply to the following effect .",
    "the fault lies not in the method but in the application of it .",
    "_ '' then , langer shows that the wkb approximation breaks down , at small @xmath5 , for an effective frequency given by eq .",
    "( [ omeh ] ) and , in addition , he suggests a method to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "the method consists in changing the variables according to @xmath23 the resulting equation for @xmath24 has again the form of eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) but the effective frequency is now given by @xmath25 as demonstrated by langer , the crucial point is that , now , the wkb approximation , applied to the schrdinger equation for @xmath26 , no longer breaks down .",
    "therefore , it is now possible to utilize the wkb formalism and to use the usual wkb approximation . transforming back to the original variables the correct factor @xmath21 appears , instead of the wrong term @xmath27^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this allows langer to conclude that his method `` _ ... is seen to amount formally to precisely the replacement of @xmath16 by @xmath17 _ '' .",
    "let us now come back to the theory of cosmological perturbations .",
    "the analogy with the previous situation is that large values of @xmath5 correspond to subhorizon scales ( @xmath28 ) whereas small values of @xmath5 correspond to superhorizon scales ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "on subhorizon scales the mode function oscillates ( @xmath30 ) and the wkb approximation can be applied in this regime without any difficulty .",
    "on superhorizon scales the perturbations do not oscillate , but this is not a problem in itself .",
    "the wkb approximation can be used in a situation where the potential energy dominates and leads to exponentially decaying / growing solutions ( e.g. in the wkb treatment of the @xmath31 decay of a radioactive nucleus ) .",
    "nevertheless , difficulties arise if one tries to find the wkb approximation to the mode equations of cosmological perturbations .    on superhorizon",
    "scales a problem arises in the naive wkb approach _",
    " la _ kramers , uhlenbeck and young from the form of the effective potential @xmath32 .",
    "it turns out to be the very same problem as encountered by atomic physicists .",
    "the resemblance is most explicit in the particular case of power - law inflation where the potential @xmath33 is exactly of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ omeh ] ) .",
    "the usual conclusion that the wkb approximation is violated for superhorizon scales is in fact not true , provided the cosmological version of the transformation  ( [ trans ] ) can be found .",
    "this opens the possibility to employ the wkb approximation to calculate the spectrum of inflationary cosmological perturbations in the superhorizon limit . in the cosmological context ,",
    "the wkb approximation is a new method for computing the power spectra , different from the more traditional slow - roll approximation .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly recall the basic results of the inflationary cosmological perturbations theory . in the third section ,",
    "we show how the wkb approximation can be applied to inflationary cosmological perturbations in the general case , i.e.  for any inflaton potential .",
    "the only restriction is that we focus on single inflaton field models .",
    "we demonstrate that the calculation of the spectrum reduces to the calculation of a single quadrature . in the fourth section",
    "we apply the wkb approximation to power - law inflation .",
    "this model is exactly solvable so that we can compare the exact result with the wkb prediction and also with the standard calculation based on the slow - roll approximation .",
    "this allows us to study the precision of the wkb approximation in the cosmological context .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that , in the regime where the slow - roll approximation breaks down ( far from scale invariance ) , the wkb approximation is still valid .",
    "this opens the possibility to calculate the power spectra of more realistic models violating the slow - roll conditions . in the fifth section",
    ", we apply the wkb approximation to the general ( first - order ) slow - roll situation .",
    "we compare the result with the standard slow - roll calculation for the amplitudes and the spectral indices .",
    "we show that the spectral indices are very well predicted while the error in the amplitude is of the order @xmath0 , i.e. less accurate than the prediction of the slow - roll approximation for this quantity . finally ,",
    "in the sixth section , we give our conclusions and indicate what the possible extensions to the present work are .",
    "the evolution of the cosmological perturbations in a single field inflationary scenario is governed by the schrdinger - like equation  ( [ osci ] ) .",
    "the effective time - dependent frequency is given by the general expression @xmath34 where the primes denote a derivatives with respect to conformal time and where @xmath35 for scalar ( density ) perturbations and @xmath36 for tensor perturbations ; @xmath37 is the scale factor of the friedmann ",

    "the equation of motion for the mode functions @xmath38 should be solved with the following initial condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary time at the beginning of inflation and @xmath45 is the planck mass .",
    "this initial condition corresponds to the fact that , initially , the modes are subhorizon and , therefore , do not feel the curvature of space - time . as a consequence",
    ", they are described by plane waves .",
    "if the initial quantum state is the vacuum state , then the statistical properties of the perturbations are entirely characterized by the two - point correlation function , i.e.  by the power spectrum .",
    "the dimensionless power spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations are calculated to read @xmath46 the spectral indices and their running are defined by the coefficients of taylor expansions of the power spectra with respect to @xmath47 , evaluated at an arbitrary pivot scale @xmath48 . to be more specific : @xmath49 are the spectral indices and the two following expressions @xmath50 define the `` running '' of these indices . in principle , we could also define the running of the running and so on .      in order to investigate the predictions of cosmological inflation in a model - independent manner , it is useful to define a set of functions that uniquely characterize the state of the universe at any given moment of time",
    ". it is usefull to describe the evolution of the universe by a set of flow equations @xcite . in this article",
    "we make use of the set of horizon flow functions , introduced in ref .",
    "the zeroth horizon flow function is defined by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the hubble rate , a dot meaning derivative with respect to cosmic time . in this expression , @xmath53 is the number of e - folds , @xmath54 , after an arbitrary initial time .",
    "the hierarchy of horizon flow functions is then defined according to @xmath55 inflation takes place for @xmath56 .",

    "the set @xmath62 is linked to the horizon flow functions @xmath63 by @xmath64    the set @xmath62 or equivalently the set @xmath65 plays a special role , since the effective potential @xmath66 of eq .",

    "one finds @xmath67 let us emphasize that these expressions are exact , no approximation has been used so far .",

    "we have @xmath184 , a value that should be compared with @xmath185 . in the limit where @xmath186 to approximate @xmath146 and one finds that @xmath187 , i.e.  the wkb approximation gives the exact result in this limit .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this limit corresponds to going away from scale invariance , i.e.  to `` fast - roll '' inflationary models ( the kinetic energy of the inflaton is of the same order as its potential energy ) .",
    "therefore , the power - law inflation with @xmath188 is an explicit example of a model where the wkb approximation gives an accurate result in a regime where the slow - roll approximation can not be used to compute the power spectrum .",
    "another remark is in order .",
    "the fact that the wkb approximation is better for large values of @xmath189 than for small values of @xmath190 ( scale invariance ) might seem to be in contradiction with eqs .",
    "( [ testdp ] ) and ( [ testgw ] ) , which indicate that @xmath80 decreases as the slow - roll parameters approach zero ( scale invariance ) .",
    "in fact , there is no contradiction because the wkb criterion only measures the accuracy with which the mode function is predicted at a given time , without taking into account the error coming from the matching procedure , while the error in the power spectrum is a combination of these two sources of error .",
    "the conclusion is that the wkb amplitude of the spectrum is always a good approximation , see fig .",
    "[ wkbamppl ] , although the precision of the prediction for the amplitudes in the case of almost scale - invariant inflation is not as good as in the slow - roll approximation @xcite .",
    "contrary to the latter , the spectral indices are predicted exactly by the wkb approximation , @xmath191 .",
    "this is a big advantage if data sets of large dynamic ranges are investigated .     with @xmath192 . in the limit @xmath193",
    ", the ratio tends towards @xmath81 .",
    "this can only be guessed from the figure because the convergence rate is slow . ]",
    "let us now compare the wkb approximation with the ( leading - order ) slow - roll approximation .",
    "a comment is in order here on the meaning of the phrases `` slow - roll conditions '' and `` slow - roll approximation '' .",
    "if the slow - roll conditions hold , all slow - roll parameters are small .",
    "this does not specify the approximate scheme that one should use in order to calculate the power spectra ; in particular it does not imply that the slow - roll approximation has to be utilized in this situation . in this section , we will determine the power spectra computed with the help of the wkb approximation in a situation where the slow - roll conditions are valid .",

    "@xcite that the corresponding time @xmath178 has a nice interpretation : it is nothing but the time at which the matching between the region where @xmath199 and the superhorizon region is performed .",
    "it is important to realize that , according to the previous definition , @xmath178 is not a function of @xmath200 , i.e. is the same for all scales . changing the time of matching is therefore equivalent to changing the pivot scale .",
    "this means that the pivot scale must be in the range of scales that are of astrophysical interest today but otherwise can be chosen freely .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the location of the pivot scale can be optimized to reduce the slow - roll error in the power spectrum .    from eqs .",
    "( [ srdp ] ) and ( [ srgw ] ) , we notice that close to the de sitter inflation the slow - roll approximation predicts the amplitude for both density and tensor perturbations very well .",
    "the accuracy of the slow - roll approximation improves as one approaches scale - invariance , since this corresponds to @xmath201 ( for power - law inflation this corresponds to @xmath202 ) .",
    "_ a priori _ , it gives an exact result for exact scale invariance but then the linear approximation blows up , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ srdp ] ) , when @xmath203 .",
    "in contrast , the wkb approximation does not give an exact result for the amplitude in the scale - invariant limit ( see the discussion of the limit @xmath202 above ) , but it is able to give a reasonable approximation in the regime where slow - roll is violated ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "the spectral indices predicted by the slow - roll approximation at first order are @xmath205 these estimates are not exact , contrary to the wkb result in the case of power - law inflation , but provide good estimates close to the scale - invariant situation .",

    "the evaluation of the integrals in the argument of the exponential functions gives @xmath209 with @xmath210 at first order , we may consider the horizon flow functions as being constants .",
    "this is due to the fact that the derivatives of the horizon flow functions are quadratic in these parameters .",

    "corrections containing @xmath219 inside the logarithm can be omitted since they contribute at higher order only .",
    "finally , the logarithm can be written @xmath227 +                     \\ln\\left[{(ah)(n_*)\\over ( ah)(n_{\\rm f})}\\right ] + \\dots                   = \\ln\\left({k\\over k_*}\\right)- \\delta n + \\dots,\\ ] ] where now the dots denote terms of order @xmath219 and we have used the pivot scale @xmath228 . putting everything together we find that all @xmath229 cancel , and the result simply reads @xmath230\\ , , \\\\ { \\cal p}_h ( k)&= & \\frac{16 h^2}{\\pi m_{_{\\rm pl}}^2 }     ( 18 { \\rm e}^{-3 } ) \\biggr[1 - 2(d + 1)\\epsilon_1     - 2\\epsilon_1\\ln \\biggl(\\frac{k}{k _ * } \\biggr )      + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon_n^2)\\biggr]\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which can now be compared with the prediction from the slow - roll power spectra ( [ srdp ] ) and ( [ srgw ] ) .",
    "it is seen immediately that the spectral indices coincide with the slow - roll result ( [ nsr ] ) . as already expected from the discussion of power - law inflation above ,",
    "the spectral indices are predicted by the wkb approximation very well , the amplitudes only at an accuracy of @xmath0 ( coming from the factor @xmath231 ) .",
    "this is certainly not good enough for future experiments , but it is well known that wkb approximations can be systematically improved .",
    "a new method to predict inflationary power spectra has been presented , based on the wkb approximation .",
    "one of the main advantages of this new scheme of approximation is that it can give a good approximation even if the slow - roll conditions are violated , whereas , up to now , all of the methods in the literature were subject to this limitation  @xcite .",
    "we have checked this fact explicitly on the example of power - law inflation .",
    "in addition , we have also tested the method for the case of slow - roll inflation and find errors below @xmath0 for all quantities considered .",
    "the prediction of the spectral indices is exact in the case of the power - law inflation .",
    "assuming that the conclusions obtained from the power - law case are also valid in a more general context , the wkb approximation appears as an efficient method , especially for predicting the spectral indices .",
    "the main restriction comes from the amplitude , which is not predicted with a similar accuracy as the slow - roll approximation close to scale invariance .",
    "a possible disadvantage of the method is that it is non - local in the sense that an integration is involved from the time of horizon crossing until some time when all the modes of interest are on superhorizon scales .",
    "this means , in contrast to the slow - roll approximation , where a certain behaviour of the background is assumed , that one needs to know how the hubble flow functions evolve with time in principle . in the example of slow - roll inflation",
    "it has been shown that one essential step in the wkb approximation is to link the predictions at some time @xmath232 to the parameters relevant at the time of horizon crossing .",
    "many improvements of the results presented in this article are possible . as already mentioned above , the wkb expansion can be pushed further , e.g. by going beyond the linear approximation for the joining of the super- and subhorizon wkb solutions .",
    "this will reduce the error in the amplitude , therefore avoiding the main shortcoming of the new method .",
    "another point is that the standard slow - roll approximation ( bessel approximation ) is valid only when the slow - roll parameters are constant .",
    "therefore , it can not be pushed beyond the first order .",
    "recently , stewart and gong  @xcite have proposed a method , based on green functions perturbative calculations , which is free from this problem .",
    "they have calculated the inflationary power spectra up to the second order .",
    "the wkb approximation is also free from the above limitation and therefore allows a determination of the spectra beyond the leading order .",
    "all these questions are currently under investigation  @xcite .",
    "_ note added : _ while the present article was being completed , a new paper  @xcite appeared where the inflationary power spectra are also calculated using a new method of approximation , namely the `` uniform approximation '' according to the terminology used in that article .",
    "some of the equations obtained in  @xcite bear a close resemblance to the results obtained in the present work as revealed by a comparison of eqs .",
