    "decay of the neutral k meson taught us the violation of cp symmetry .",
    "our understanding about the cp violation is based on one complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , however , our knowledge of the ckm phase is poor today .",
    "the projects of the b - factory are starting at kek and slac , where ckm sector of sm will be tested by using e.g. unitarity triangle in the b meson system .",
    "the precise determination of the ckm parameters will be one of the most important progresses to understand the nature , physics of violated symmetry .",
    "experiments in the k meson system have entered new period .",
    "that is the observation of the rare process , @xmath7 and the search for @xmath8 .",
    "recently , the signature of decay @xmath9 has been observed by e787 collaboration @xcite and the reported branching ratio is @xmath10 , which is consistent with the expectation value in sm .",
    "additional data are expected as well as the improvement of the experimental data in the near future @xcite .",
    "this situation forces us the detail study of the rare decays of the k mesons .",
    "the decay @xmath11 is one of the most promissing process since it is a cp violating mode in sm .",
    "this mode is theoretically clean to extract the ckm parameter @xmath12 @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate rare decays of the k mesons in left - right ( lr ) model @xcite introducing right handed neutrinos .",
    "however , in the model , the neutrino masses are zero in the tree level and lepton flavor is well conserved @xcite ( also see analyses in the other models @xcite ) .",
    "there appear scalar and tensor operators @xmath13d ) ( \\bar{\\nu}\\left[1,\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\right]\\nu)$ ] from the lr box diagrams , in which left and right handed gauge bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 are exchanged .",
    "the scalar operators have an enhancement factor @xmath3 in the matrix element @xmath4 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 is k meson and strange quark mass respectively ) .",
    "thus the scalar operator may have large contribution to the rare decays of k mesons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "an important point is that the cp property of the scalar interaction is different from the v - a interaction @xmath20 in sm . the decay @xmath11 through the scalar operator is not cp violating one , so we have non - zero branching ratio @xmath21 even in the cp conserved limit ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , it is interesting to estimate how large the effect of the scalar operator in the pion energy spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first discuss the rare decays of the k meson rather generally with an effective lagrangian including the scalar interaction . the scalar interaction in lr model",
    "is briefly discussed . in section 3 , we show the pion energy spectrum in lr model , section 5 is devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "rare decays , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes which are loop - induced one in sm and short - distance dominated one , so theoretically very clean modes @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements involved in these decays are related to experimentally well known leading decay @xmath23 using isospin symmetry , and corrections to this relations have been studied @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we start our discussion from following effective lagrangian : @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "the first term is given by sm contributions @xcite and the second and third terms are given by new contributions in our model .",
    "the scalar and tensor operators may generally appear from box diagram when one consider a model which contains the right handed charged gauge boson @xmath15 . in this paper , we only discuss the contribution from the scalar operator and show the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "first we show the decay amplitude for the neutral k meson , @xmath5 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 are : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a short hand notation for @xmath32 .",
    "the cp conserved limit corresponds to @xmath33 with all coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 being real . in this limit ,",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath35 through the v - a interaction is zero , while @xmath36 is nonzero and the decays through the scalar operators @xmath37 remain non - zero generally . in lr symmetric case ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 decay through",
    "the scalar operators are the cp violating mode , while cp is conserved for @xmath40 decay .",
    "thus decays of neutral k meson in lr symmetric case are summarized as follows : @xmath41 experimentally we do not observe neutrinos , so the pion energy spectrum is obtained by summing these contributions which have different cp properties each other .",
    "the @xmath5 decay through v - a operator is suppressed due to cp symmetry , but decays through the scalar operators are cp conserved ones and furthermore its matrix element is enhanced by use of equation of motion : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the contribution of the scalar interaction to the decay amplitude @xmath45 is sizable and dominates at cp conserved limit .",
    "the decay amplitude for the charged k meson @xmath46 is obtained in the same way : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "now we show explicit form of the coefficient function @xmath26 in lr model @xcite .",
    "we choose lr symmetric case , @xmath49 .",
    "there are two types of diagrams , penguin and box , which contribute to the process we are interested in .",
    "however , only the box diagrams produce the scalar operator @xmath50 in the effective lagrangian",
    ". thus we do not consider the contributions from penguin diagrams in this paper .",
    "there are tensor operators @xmath51 from box diagram in lr model , which will be discussed in the other place @xcite .",
    "we calculate box diagrams , in which left handed @xmath14 boson ( w in sm ) and right handed gauge boson @xmath52 are exchanged [ fig.1 ] .",
    "there are corresponding charged higgs diagrams due to the gauge invariance .",
    "the internal upper fermion lines correspond to the ordinary and singlet quarks , the lower correspond to sm and singlet leptons .",
    "the coefficients in the effective lagrangian are : @xmath53 , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a mixing angle between singlet left / right handed quark and corresponding doublet quark , @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 ckm matrix element .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are dimensionless parameters defined by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a mass of the ordinary quark / lepton and mass of the heavy singlet quark / lepton . the function @xmath62 is defined by : @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1+\\beta}{4 } \\left [ \\frac{x^{2}\\ln x        } { ( 1-x)(1-\\beta x)(x - y ) } + ( i \\leftrightarrow j ) -\\frac{\\ln",
    "\\beta         } { ( 1-\\beta)(1-\\beta x)(1-\\beta y ) } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath27 ( @xmath64 ) for electron and muon is negligibly small and only @xmath65 contributes to the process significantly .",
    "the dependence on the internal quark is very similar to the one in the sm . for the top sector , coefficients are large by the top quark mass , but suppressed by the ckm factor @xmath66 compared to the one for the charm sector .",
    "the coefficient for the up quark sector is negligible .",
    "all the coefficients of the scalar interactions are suppressed by the @xmath58 , so the v - a interaction in sm dominates when @xmath67 becomes large .",
    "in this section , we present the pion energy spectrum by using the coefficient in section 2 . in the process @xmath68 ,",
    "contribution from the scalar interactions are tiny compared to the one in sm .",
    "the pion energy spectrum for the decay @xmath69 is : @xmath70 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is a normalized pion energy defined by @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are defined .",
    "the process @xmath76 is more sensitive to probe the scalar interactions as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the energy spectrum is given by : @xmath77 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is the sm contribution from v - a operator @xmath78 , and the second is the contribution from the scalar operator which has a enhancement factor @xmath79 in the matrix element .",
    "form factors are related to the one of experimentally well known leading decay mode @xmath80 .",
    "we show the pion energy spectrum @xmath81 , in which we summed over neutrino flavors and normalized by a factor @xmath82 , in fig.2 .",
    "we have discussed rare decays of k mesons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 including the contributions from scalar operators in the effective lagrangian , which is produced from lr box diagram , for the decay @xmath83 , contribution from lr model is small compared to the one of sm . for the decay @xmath84 , there is significant contribution from the scalar operator , especially in the low energy region of the pion energy spectrum , which amount to about 30 % enhancement to total branching ratio , with the parameters @xmath85 and right handed gauge boson mass @xmath86 [ gev ] .",
    "thus , measuring the decay @xmath84 precisely is very important to probe the effect from new physics .",
