    "gain combining ( egc ) is an important diversity technique that is often used to mitigate fading in various wireless communications systems [ 1 ] .",
    "the egc has several practical advantages over other diversity techniques , because it has close to optimal performance and yet is simple to implement .",
    "the outage probability ( op ) is the primary performances measure for all diversity systems , particularly those exposed to cochannel interference ( cci ) such as the cellular mobile systems .",
    "when the cci is the predominant noise source at the receiver , its op represents the first - order statistical property of the output signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) .",
    "the op of the interference - limited egc systems was studied in [ 2]-[3 ] and references therein .",
    "apart from the op , some aspects in the design and the analysis of wireless communication systems must also consider the signal correlation properties , thus necessitating the determination of its second - order statistical properties : the average level crossing rate ( lcr ) and the average fade duration ( afd ) .",
    "they are used for proper selection of adaptive symbol rates , interleaver depth , packet length and time slot duration in various wireless communication systems . while these statistics have already been determined for the signal envelope at the output of egc systems exposed to various fading channels and thermal noise [ 4]-[6 ] , the sir statistics of the egc systems subject to cci",
    "have not yet been derived analytically to the best of author s knowledge .",
    "the average lcr and the afd of the sir at the output of selection combining ( sc ) and maximal - ratio combining ( mrc ) systems exposed to cci and various fading ( rayleigh , rice and nakagami ) channels have been reported only recently in [ 7]-[8 ] , but these works do not consider the egc systems .",
    "this paper focuses specifically on an interference - limited coherent egc system with an arbitrary diversity order and an arbitrary number of cochannel interferers , and derives analytical solutions for the average lcr and the afd of the output sir in rayleigh fading channels .",
    "section ii presents the coherent egc system model and the channel model , including the two feasible scenarios for interference combining .",
    "section iii presents the analysis that yields to the analytical solutions of the op , the average lcr and the afd in forms of an infinite integral and an infinite series .",
    "the section iv compares the computational burden between these two solutions and provides several numerical examples that illustrate the behaviors of the first - order and the second - order signal statistics .",
    "section v summarizes the main results and concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a coherent egc communication receiver with @xmath0 diversity branches .",
    "it is exposed to the transmissions of a single desired and @xmath1 interference users , whose signal replicas in each diversity branch are received over independent identically distributed ( iid ) rayleigh flat fading channels .    in each diversity branch",
    "@xmath2 @xmath3 , the desired signal is assumed to have an average power @xmath4 , while all interference signals have an equal average power @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the channel gains in each branch can be represented as equivalent complex zero - mean gaussian random variables ( rvs ) @xmath6 ; more particulary , @xmath7 with variance @xmath4 represents the desired signal in branch @xmath2 , while @xmath8 @xmath9 with variance @xmath5 represents @xmath10-th interference signal in branch @xmath2 .",
    "the phases of the desired signals @xmath11 and the interference signal @xmath12 follow the uniform probability distribution function ( pdf ) over @xmath13 , while the respective envelopes @xmath14 and @xmath15 follow the rayleigh pdf .",
    "due to the transmitter / receiver mobility and their relative velocity , the fading channel introduces time correlation of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath16 ( i.e. , in - phase and quadrature components of the desired signal ) with maximum doppler frequency shift @xmath17 in their power spectra .",
    "additionally , the real and imaginary parts of the channel gains @xmath6 of each interfering signal @xmath10 are also assumed be time correlated with an identical maximum doppler frequency shift @xmath18 .    in egc systems , the desired signal replicas in each of the @xmath0 branches",
    "are co - phased , equally weighted , and then coherently added to give the resultant desired output signal . for the interference combining ,",
    "there are two possible scenarios : the signal replicas originating from any interferer can combine either incoherently [ 2 , section iii ] or coherently [ 3 ] .",
    "if the interference signals are combined incoherently at the egc output , the instantaneous sir @xmath19 is determined as [ 2 , eq .",

    "thus , any single element in the denominator of ( 1 ) , @xmath21 , is a chi - squared rv with 2 degrees of freedom , so the entire denominator , given by @xmath22 follows the chi - squared pdf with @xmath23 degrees of freedom , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gamma function , defined by @xmath26 [ 14 ] .",
    "if the interference signals are combined coherently at the egc output , the instantaneous sir @xmath27 is determined as [ 3 , eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] , @xmath28 where it is assumed that the roll - off factor of the equivalent baseband communication system is zero . in ( 4 ) , the complex interference signals from all branches are first added together and then squared .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is a complex gaussian rv with zero mean and variance @xmath30 , while its squared envelope ( i.e. its power ) is a chi - squared rv with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the denominator in ( 4 ) , given by @xmath31 follows the chi - squared pdf with @xmath32 degrees of freedom , @xmath33 the pdf of the numerators in ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , which are the square of the desired output signal envelope @xmath34 is not known in closed form , except for @xmath35 .",

    "( cf ) method to arrive at the desired results .",

    "however , we utilize an alternative approach , which circumvents explicit determination of @xmath103 . from ( 8)-(9 ) , the time derivative of the envelopes ratio @xmath41 is written as @xmath104    conditioned on @xmath105 , the joint pdf @xmath106 is calculated as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the pdf of the equivalent interference signal envelope @xmath109 . in ( 24 ) , @xmath110 is the conditional joint pdf of @xmath41 and @xmath45 given some specified value of the interference signal envelope @xmath105 , which is expressed as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the conditional pdf of @xmath41 given @xmath105 . because of ( 8)-(9 ) , it follows @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the pdf of the desired output signal envelope @xmath36 .    in ( 25 ) , @xmath115 is the conditional pdf of @xmath45 given some specified values of the envelopes ratio @xmath116 and the interference signal envelope @xmath105 . considering ( 23 ) ,",

    "<S> both the first - order signal statistics ( e.g. the outage probability ) and the second - order signal statistics ( e.g. the average level crossing rate , lcr , and the average fade duration , afd ) are important design criteria and performance measures for the wireless communication systems , including the equal gain combining ( egc ) systems in presence of the cochannel interference ( cci ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the analytical expressions for the outage probability of the coherent egc systems exposed to cci and various fading channels are already known , the respective ones for the average lcr and the afd are not available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents such analytical expressions for the rayleigh fading channel , which are obtained by utilizing a novel analytical approach that does not require the explicit expression for the joint pdf of the instantaneous output signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) and its time derivative . applying the characteristic function method and the beaulieu series , we determined the average lcr and the afd at the output of an interference - limited egc system with an arbitrary diversity order and an arbitrary number of cochannel interferers in forms of an infinite integral and an infinite series . for the dual diversity case , </S>",
