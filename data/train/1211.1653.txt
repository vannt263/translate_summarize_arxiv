    "the solution of differential equations by means of expansions into discrete variable representation ( dvr ) basis functions has become very popular since it was first introduced in the early 1960 s @xcite .",
    "a review can be found in the paper by light and carrington @xcite , and generalizations to multidimensional expansions are also under development @xcite .",
    "previously the main application of the dvr method was for obtaining bound state energies and wave functions .",
    "for this purpose the wave function is expanded into a set of @xmath3 basis functions , whose expansion coefficients are to be determined .",
    "the calculations are of the galerkin type , namely , the hamiltonian applied to the wave function is multiplied on the left by each one of the expansion basis functions , and the result is integrated over the full range of the domain of the variable , leading to a set of @xmath3 linear equations for the expansion coefficients .",
    "the integrals to be evaluated are then approximated by discrete sums over the values of the integrand evaluated at the support points times certain weight factors such as in the gauss quadrature methods @xcite .    in the case of the solution of scattering problems the finite element method ( fem )",
    "@xcite has also been developed . in this procedure",
    "the radial range is divided into partitions , also called elements , and the solution of the wave equation in each partition is expanded into basis functions such as hat  functions , gaussians , or polynomials of a given order , whose expansion coefficients are to be determined .",
    "the equations for the expansion coefficients are obtained through a galerkin procedure , and in many cases the integrals over the basis functions can be done analytically .",
    "the continuity of the wave function from one partition to the next is achieved by imposing conditions on the expansion coefficients , as is done for example in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the more recent dvr methods the basis functions are lagrange polynomials whose zeros occur at the lobatto points @xcite , @xcite , in which case the quadrature is denoted as gauss - lobatto , and the basis set of functions is denoted as lagrange - lobatto .",
    "this basis set was first suggested by manolopoulos and wyatt @xcite , and a extensive review is given in ref .",
    "the main computational advantage of using dvr basis functions is that the sum mentioned above reduces to only one term , because the product of two different dvr functions vanishes at the support points , and only products between the same dvr functions remain .",
    "furthermore , within the approximation of the gauss - lobatto quadrature rule , the basis functions are orthogonal .",
    "hence the procedure leads to a discretized hamiltonian ( @xmath4 matrix ,",
    "whose eigenfunctions determine the expansion coefficients and the eigenvalues determine the bound - state energies . there are several types of errors introduced by this method .",
    "one is due to the truncation of the expansion of the wave function in terms of basis functions at an upper limit @xmath5 another is due to the approximation of the gauss - lobatto quadrature described above in terms of discrete sums over the support points .",
    "a third error is the accumulation of machine round - off errors .",
    "these errors have been examined for bound state energy eigenvalues , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  and it is found that the convergence of the energy with the number @xmath3 of dvr basis functions is exponential , and the non - orthogonality error becomes small as @xmath3 increases .",
    "very recently a combination of the fe and dvr methods has been introduced into atomic physics by rescigno and mccurdy @xcite for quantum scattering calculations .",
    "these calculations use the fem approach but in each partition the basis functions are lagrange polynomials , and the support points are gauss- lobatto .",
    "this hybrid  method , denoted as fe - dvr , is now extensively used for atomic physics calculations , such as for multi electron density distributions in atoms @xcite , for photo - ionizing cross sections with fast photon pulses @xcite , @xcite , and for atom - atom scattering calculations @xcite , to name a few . however , in these works the accuracy of the results was not studied in detail .",
    "the fe - dvr method is also used extensively for fluid dynamic calculations since the 1980 s @xcite and also in seismology @xcite , where it is called spectral element method .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to investigate the accuracy of the fe - dvr method for the scattering conditions , since all the errors described above ( the gauss- lobatto s integration error , the truncation errors of the expansions , and the accumulation of round - off errors ) are still present . in our study a method of imposing the continuity of the wave function and of the derivative from one partition to the next is explicitly given , and the accuracy is obtained by comparing the results of the fe - dvr calculation for particular solutions of a one dimensional schrdinger equation with a spectral @xcite chebyshev expansion method @xcite , s - iem .",
    "the accuracy of the latter is of the order of @xmath6 as is demonstrated in appendix a. in our present formulation of the fe - dvr the so - called bridge functions used in references @xcite-@xcite in order to assure the continuity of the wave function are not used , but are replaced by another method .    in section ii the fe - dvr method",
    "is described , in section iii the accuracy is investigated by means of numerical examples , and section iv contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "appendix @xmath7 contains a short review of the s - iem method , in appendix @xmath8 an estimate of the accumulation of errors is presented , and in appendix @xmath9 some accuracy properties of the finite difference numerov ( or milne s ) method are presented .",
    "the fe - dvr version of the finite element method differs from the conventional fem in that the basis functions for the expansion of the solution @xmath10 in each partition are  @xmath3 discrete variable representation  ( dvr ) functions , which in the present case are lagrange polynomials @xmath11 , @xmath12 of a given order @xmath13 @xmath14 defined for example in eq .",

    "@xcite , and in section 3.3(i ) of ref .",

    "this fe and dvr combination was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has the advantage that integrals involving these polynomials amount to sums over the functions evaluated only at the support points . in the present case",

    "@xmath30 our method differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in that we do not use their bridge  functions , but rather insure continuity of the solution and its derivative from one partition to the next by using only the lagrange functions . since the lobatto points are not evenly spaced , expansion ( [ 2a ] ) converges uniformly , which is a general feature of spectral methods @xcite .",
    "a further @xmath31 advantage is that the gauss - lobato approximation of the integral @xmath32 is diagonal in @xmath33 and is given by only one term .",
    "the convolution @xmath34 is also approximated by one non - diagonal term only , which is a marked advantage for solving nonlocal or coupled channel schrdinger equations .",

    "we divide the radial interval into @xmath53 partitions ( also called elements in the finite element calculations @xcite ) , and in each partition we expand the wave function into @xmath3 lagrange functions @xmath54@xmath55 the starting and end points of each partition are denoted as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we define the value and the derivative of the wave function at the end point of the previous partition as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the last coefficient of the expansion ( [ 1a ] ) of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath62 the result ( [ 1b ] ) follows from the fact that that @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .  for the first partition",

    "that is equivalent to renormalizing the value of @xmath66 . in finite element calculations continuity conditions of the wave function from one partition to the next are also imposed .",

    "this feature permits one to easily solve the schrdinger eq . also  in the presence of nonlocal potentials with a kernel of the form @xmath142 as is demonstrated in one of our numerical examples .",

    "a possible disadvantage may be that if the number of the lagrange polynomials in each partition is very large and/or the number of partitions is large , as is the case for long ranged potentials , then the accumulation of roundoff and algorithm errors may become unacceptably large .    in summary",
    ", for scattering solutions of the schrdinger equation the accuracy of the fe - dvr method increases exponentially with the number of lagrange polynomials in each partition until the accumulation of roundoff and truncation errors overwhelm the result .",
    "the fe - dvr can easily achieve an accuracy of the order of @xmath133 for the scattering phase shifts for either local or nonlocal short ranged potentials ; it is less complex than the spectral s - iem method but is comparable in the amount of computing time ; and , in addition , it is substantially more efficient than a finite difference numerov method .",
