    ", we derive an exact formula for the free energy in terms of the dilogarithm function in an arbitrary magnetic field , and show that its magnetization can be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "section  [ sec.zerob ] is devoted to a detailed study of the zero magnetic field case .",
    "in particular , we show that the susceptibility can be expressed for all three chains of hs type in terms of the error function , discuss the connection of these chains with two - level systems , and derive low - temperature asymptotic expansions the chains thermodynamic functions . in section  [ sec.zerot ]",
    "we study the zero temperature limit in the presence of an arbitrary external magnetic field in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes .",
    "we explicitly show that in both regimes there is a phase transition , as was to be expected on general grounds  @xcite . in section  [ sec.ising ] we present a novel interpretation of the thermodynamic quantities of spin chains of hs type as weighted averages of the analogous quantities over an ensemble of classical ising chains .",

    "in this section we shall derive a closed form expression for the partition functions of the hs chains   in the presence of a constant @xmath1 magnetic field . for definiteness ,",
    "we shall deal with the pf chain , whose interactions are defined by eq .  .",
    "as we mentioned above , this chain is obtained by applying the freezing trick to the @xmath1 spin calogero model in a constant magnetic field , whose hamiltonian we shall take as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 more precisely , let @xmath70 denote the hamiltonian of the scalar calogero model  @xcite , and define @xmath71 so that @xmath72 it is well known  @xcite that the chain sites @xmath73 of the pf chain are the coordinates of the unique minimum of the scalar potential @xmath74 in the principal weyl chamber of @xmath0 type @xmath75 , where the motion of the particles of the calogero model can be restricted due to the singularities of its hamiltonian . from this fact and eq .",

    "finally , in the case of the fi chain we have @xmath501 and therefore @xmath502 hence the weight function @xmath494 is given in this case by @xmath503 introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath504 and @xmath505 ( where @xmath506 $ ] in the ferromagnetic case and @xmath507 $ ] in the antiferromagnetic one ) we can rewrite the previous formulas as @xmath508^{-1/2}\\,,&{\\mbox{for the fi chain}}\\,.\\vrule width0pt depth9pt    \\end{cases}\\ ] ]     versus dimensionless ising coupling @xmath509 for the hs ( light blue ) , pf ( blue ) and fi ( @xmath344 , green ; @xmath510 , orange ) chains in the ferromagnetic case . ]",
    "equation   clearly implies that any thermodynamic quantity of a spin chain of hs type is the average of this quantity over an ensemble of standard ising models with respect to the appropriate weight function @xmath494 in eqs .  . in other words , a _ single _",
    "spin chain of hs type is thermodynamically equivalent to a suitably weighted _",
    "ensemble _ of standard ising models . from this novel point of view",
    ", the fundamental difference between the three types of hs chains  - is the fact that the weight function @xmath494 increases with the ising coupling constant @xmath43 for the hs chain , is constant for the pf chain , and decreases with @xmath43 for the fi chain ; cf .",
    "[ fig.rhoj ] .",
    "the study of this weight function can also uncover some unexpected relations between the different families of chains of hs type .",
    "for instance , from eq .",
    "it follows that the normalized densities of the hs chain and the fi chain with @xmath344 are dual , in the sense that they are related by the reflection @xmath511 ( cf .",
    "[ fig.rhoj ] ) .",
    "in this paper we derive the thermodynamics of the three families of spin chains of haldane  shastry type  - in a unified way .",
    "the main idea behind our approach is to exploit the equivalence of these chains with a corresponding family of ising - like inhomogeneous vertex models . in the absence of an external magnetic field",
    ", this fact had already been conjectured by frahm  @xcite and by frahm and inozemtsev  @xcite , and was recently established in a rigorous way in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize the results of the latter work to the case of an arbitrary magnetic field . using the equivalence between spin chains of hs type and inhomogeneous vertex models , in the case of spin @xmath181 we are able to compute the large @xmath38 limit of the chains canonical partition function by means of the transfer matrix method .",
    "we obtain in this way an explicit unified expression of the free energy per site , which we systematically use for a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic properties .",
    "in particular , we deduce asymptotic formulas for the relevant thermodynamic quantities in both the zero magnetic field and the zero temperature limits .",
    "finally , we use the explicit formula for the free energy to show that spin chains of hs type are thermodynamically equivalent to a suitably weighted average of one - dimensional ( _ homogeneous _ ) ising models .",
    "as remarked throughout the preceding sections , some of the formulas for the thermodynamic quantities of the hs - type chains derived in this paper have previously appeared in the literature , especially in the case of the original haldane  shastry chain .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that our approach to the thermodynamics of these chains differs from previous related work in two essential ways .",
    "first of all , we treat all three families of spin chains of hs type in a unified way via their dispersion relation @xmath239 ( cf .  ) . as discussed in the previous section , this is possible due to the equivalence of these models ( in the thermodynamic limit ) to an inhomogeneous ising model with couplings proportional to the values of the dispersion relation at the points @xmath512 , @xmath513 . on a more technical level",
    ", our method for studying the thermodynamics of spin chains of hs type is simply based on the evaluation of the canonical partition function in the thermodynamic limit through the standard transfer matrix approach .",
    "we thus bypass the more complex analysis relying on the equivalence of these models to an ideal gas of spinons used by haldane to compute the thermodynamic functions of the original hs chain  @xcite , which requires the use of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the results presented in this paper can be generalized in two different directions .",
    "on the one hand , it should be possible to apply our analysis to general vertex models of the form  , in which the coupling @xmath514 between consecutive spins is an arbitrary polynomial ( or even a @xmath515 function ) in the variable @xmath516 , @xmath513 . these models , which have been recently studied by basu - mallick and collaborators  @xcite , share certain basic properties with spin chains of hs - type ; for instance , their energies are normally distributed in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand , it should also be of interest to extend our results to other types of hs chains , particularly those associated with the @xmath517 and @xmath48 root systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the first step in this direction would be to ascertain whether these spin chains are isospectral to suitable vertex models analogous to",
