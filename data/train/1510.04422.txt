    "as in other areas , data play a key role in relevant scientific publication recommendation research .",
    "the purpose of this task is to recommend publications that are relevant to researchers research interests @xcite . in this task ,",
    "the most popular evaluation approach is offline evaluation , which is based on ground truth data that contain the publications which are known to be relevant to each researcher .",
    "building ground truth data is usually difficult and expensive .",
    "some researchers manually built ground truth data by surveying a group of researchers , which is costly so the datasets are usually small and prone to biased evaluation .",
    "moreover , due to privacy issues , these datasets are not fully shared .",
    "some other researchers use datasets adapted from reference management systems but their offline and online evaluation results have been shown to be conflicting @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to find another approach to build ground truth data .    naturally thinking ,",
    "since researchers cite publications that are related to their researches , references are relevant to researchers interests .",
    "hence , it is intuitive to built ground truth data based on reference data .",
    "a similar approach has been used in the task of recommending citation , a.k.a .",
    "citation prediction .",
    "unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , this approach has not been explored in the task of recommending relevant publication . in this paper",
    ", we systematically study this approach to give some insights about its applicability .",
    "first , we construct and analyze the hypotheses based on the information needs theory to support this approach . in addition",
    ", we propose a process to automatically build ground truth data from bibliographic data .",
    "then , we empirically assess it by statistical analysis of the evaluation results on two types of ground truth data , the automatically - built and the manually - built .",
    "we show that this approach is reasonable and has many advantages .",
    "however , the empirical analysis shows both positive and negative results . in general , evaluation on two types of ground truth data",
    "are almost consistent but detailed analysis shows that it is not always confidently guaranteed .",
    "this research presents the following main contributions .    1 .",
    "we systematically explore the approach that builds ground truth data for evaluation of relevant scientific publication recommendation based on reference data .",
    "we conclude that , in some situations , this is a reasonable and useful alternative approach toward overcoming data limitation .",

    "the emerging trend in relevant scientific publication recommendation research has raised an increasing attention to ground truth data @xcite .",
    "many approaches have been proposed but all of them have flaws .",
    "some researchers manually build ground truth data by surveying a group of researchers . with a high cost ,",
    "these datasets are usually small , e.g. , with only 28 researchers @xcite . moreover , due to privacy issues , these datasets are not fully shared .",
    "some researchers use datasets adapted from reference management systems , e.g. , mendeley and docear . however , ground truth data in these datasets are not guaranteed to represent researchers real research interests . another approach to build dataset is crowdsourcing but it has not been used in relevant scientific publication recommendation area and requires complicated systems .    a promising approach is building ground truth data based on reference data .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no research has been done on assessing its applicability . in this paper",
    ", we systematically explore this approach .",
    "in this section , we construct and analyze the hypotheses to support the approach to build ground truth data based on reference data .",
    "the purpose of recommending relevant publications for researchers is to satisfy researchers information needs by providing publications that match their research interests .",
    "information needs is the desire to obtain information to satisfy a conscious or unconscious need @xcite . in this research ,",
    "we analyze researchers information needs in the context of doing research and writing scientific publications w.r.t .",
    "research phases @xcite .",
    "most researches start with a literature survey , then developing new ideas and doing experiment , finally writing publications to report the results , and publishing them .",
    "ideally , in such a process , researchers seek potentially relevant publications and select which are worth reading . after reading",
    ", they can identify relevant publications .",
    "when researchers write their publications , they cite the most relevant publications .",
    "citing is the activity that shows an official acknowledgment of researchers to a publication as a fulfillment for their information needs .",
    "information needs could be expressed in different ways and citing is the one that actually expose the information needs of researchers .",
    "based on this analysis , we construct the following hypothesis .    * hypothesis 1 . * _ in the context of doing research and writing scientific publications , there are many levels of exposing a researcher s information needs in which citing is the highest level .",
    "_      when conducting a research , researchers are gradually realizing their information needs , which are finally expressed by citing a set of references .",
    "these references are equivalent to information requirements in the research context @xcite . ideally , these references really do satisfy the researchers information needs , either consciously or unconsciously .",
    "thus , they are relevant to the researchers .",
    "we note that researchers could not cite all publications that are relevant , so these references are not exhaustive but they are the most important ones .",
    "naturally , researchers may temporally change their research interests , so relevancy is temporal , i.e. , references form the set of relevant publications in a specific period of time .",
    "future references , which are newly cited in the future but not in the past , reflect the changes in researchers research interests .",
    "this type of information provides an interesting instrument for evaluation . finally , we come up with the following hypothesis",
    ".    * hypothesis 2 . * _ references made by researchers are their relevant publications . moreover , they are the most important ones .",
    "_      evaluation is essential in recommendation systems research @xcite .",
    "its function is to compare different methods .",
    "the most popular evaluation approach is offline evaluation @xcite based on the preprepared relevant items in ground truth data .",
    "thus , the most important property of ground truth data is relevancy .    with regard to reference data ,",
    "researchers have spent a lot of time and effort to find the most relevant publications to cite .",
    "this is a serious process occurring in real life .",
    "hence , the relevancy of references is actually judged based on their content by researchers , so , references have the potential to be used as ground truth data .",
    "however , ground truth data need to be unobserved at the training phase of experiments . to guarantee this condition , we could separate data into past data and future data based on publications published year using a timestamp defined as the present .",
    "training data are only extracted from past data , while ground truth data are from future data .    with regard to ordinary ground truth data , a popular approach to get relevant publications is surveying researchers .",
    "this process is similar to the process producing references .",
    "however , researchers usually lack time and motivation , so in some cases , relevancy might be decided based on publication titles only . as a result",
    ", it lacks the depth and coverage of reference data .",
    "so , reference data are theoretically more suitable to be used to build ground truth data .",
    "we summarize this analysis by the following hypothesis .",
    "* hypothesis 3 . * _ future references could be used as ground truth data in evaluation of recommending relevant publications for researchers .",
    "_    online evaluation is another approach that is more expensive but considered better than offline evaluation @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the real interactions between users and systems to compare different methods .",
    "we believe that reference data , which are also based on real interactions , are potentially as good as online evaluation",
    ".    in this paper , we partially assess these hypotheses through the comparison with ordinary ground truth data . extensive assessment , which requires comparison with online evaluation , is out of the scope of this paper and reserved for future research .",
    "these concepts are used in the proposed process to build ground truth data .    _",

    "some researches have been done on building bibliographic data @xcite .",

    "many approaches to solve this problem have been proposed recently @xcite",

    "p - value _",
    "@xmath26 0.001 guarantees that the correlations are statistically generalizable .",

    ".    however , evaluation results on separate metrics are less correlated .",
    "particularly , the correlation is still strong on _ ndcg _ but there is almost no correlation on _ mrr_. this means the order of recommended items is consistently evaluated but the position of the first correct ones is not .",
