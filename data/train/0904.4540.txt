    "low - dimensional materials are expected to play a key role in nanotechnology .",
    "for example , it is desirable to use two dimensional materials to build electronics on flexible , lightweight , and cheap substrates like plastics .",
    "@xcite silicon is the fundamental semiconducting material in electronics . due to its relatively large size , it prefers to form four covalent @xmath1 bonds in tetragonal coordination ( sp@xmath2 hybridization ) instead of forming strong planar @xmath3 bonds through sp@xmath4 hybridization .",
    "a stable two dimensional silicon material is planar polysilane , @xcite which is composed of a buckled hexagonal silicon framework and hydrogen atoms on both sides to saturate dangling bonds .",
    "layered polysilane has been synthesized experimentally,@xcite and due to confinement effect , its electronic structure is different from bulk silicon . @xcite    after the successful experimental preparation of graphene,@xcite carbon based materials become a rising star for two dimensional electronics .",
    "@xcite compared to silicon , carbon have smaller radius , and stable @xmath3 bonds can be formed between carbon atoms within a plane .",
    "therefore , the stablest two dimensional carbon structure is a hexagonal lattice , namely graphene .",
    "carriers in graphene show massless dirac fermion behavior , and there is a symmetry between electron and hole in graphene . since graphene is a semimetal , an energy gap must be opened before any graphenium microprocessor can be realized . a natural way for this purpose",
    "is to convert the sp@xmath4 bond in graphene to sp@xmath2 bond via hydrogenation .",
    "such a carbon based sp@xmath2 structure is called graphane , the carbon analogue of planar polysilane , which was theoretically predicted to have a finite energy gap .",
    "@xcite recently , graphane has been synthesized by hydrogen plasma treatment @xcite or by electron - induced dissociation of hydrogen silsesquioxane .",
    "@xcite    for various electronics applications , it is very desirable to have the capability to fully control the energy gaps and electronic structures of planar polysilane and graphane . on -",
    "plane chemical functionalization is an important way towards this direction .",
    "hydroxy group @xcite substitution on planar polysilane has been studied .",
    "the product , siloxene , has a direct energy gap instead of the indirect one in unsubstituted planar polysilane .",
    "@xcite for two dimensional carbon based materials , previous electronic structure engineering attempts by chemical means mainly focuses on graphene nanoribbon edge modification .",
    "@xcite however , on - plane functionalization does not need to cut the graphene sheet , and it is expected to be a more feasible way to realize electronics on graphene ( for example , by printing circuit on graphene ) .",
    "although graphene oxide ( go ) represents an on - plane chemically modified carbon material , it is mainly studied as an intermediate for massively production of graphene , @xcite and the detailed structure of go is still unclear .",
    "@xcite    despite its importance , a systematical study of on - plane chemical functionalization for two dimensional silicon and carbon materials is still unavailable .",
    "most importantly , how the electronic structure depends on the adsorption configuration of functional groups has not been discussed , which is very important for practical realization of electronic structure engineering in experiment .",
    "another not considered important issue is the nearly - free - electron ( nfe ) states .",
    "nfe states are delocalized on the surface outside the atomic centers .",
    "@xcite when they are close to the band edge , nfe states become a determining factor of the band gap width .",
    "@xcite since nfe states have unique space distribution , we expect their response to surface chemical functionalization to be different than other states .    in this article",
    ", we systematically studied the on - plane chemical modification on planar polysilane and graphane .",
    "functionalization leads to significant electronic structure modification .",
    "interestingly , electronic structure of fluorinated polysilane is much less sensitive to the f adsorption configuration than graphane .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as the following . in section",
    "ii , we describe the computational details . the main results are discussed in section iii .",
    "we first compare the electronic structure of two dimensional polysilane and graphane , and the nfe state on graphane is introduced .",
    "then , we discuss different behaviors upon f substitution for these two systems .",
    "other functional groups are finally discussed .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "to investigate the geometric structures and electronic states of polysilane and graphane based systems , we performed first - principles dft calculations with the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite was used for electron - ion interaction , and the perdew - wang form @xcite of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was adopted for electronic exchange and correlation .",
    "a kinetic - energy cutoff of 400 ev was selected for plane wave basis set .",
    "for pristine planar polysilane and graphane we chose a 1@xmath51 unit cell , and a 2@xmath52 supercell was used to consider chemical modification .",
    "the vacuum space between two neighboring two - dimensional sheets is larger than 15  , and dipole correction is applied to compensate artificial dipole interaction between neighoring supercells in the direction perpendicular to the plane .",
    "a 13@xmath513@xmath51 @xmath6-point mesh was used in geometry optimizations , and a 27@xmath527@xmath51 grid was used for static electronic structure calculations .",
    "geometry structures were relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 0.01 ev /  and the the convergence criteria for energy is @xmath7 ev . a series of unit cells were scanned for each system to obtained the lattice parameters with the lowest energy .",
    "charge populations were calculated using bader s atom in molecule ( aim ) method based on charge density topological analysis.@xcite",
    "first , we compare the geometrical and electronic structures of planar polysilane and graphane . both of them",
    "are composed of a buckled hexagonal plane of silicon or carbon , and hydrogen atoms on both sides of the plane to saturate the sp@xmath2 @xmath1 bonds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) .",
    "the optimized si - si bond length is 2.36  , similar to its calculated bulk value ( 2.35  ) .",
    "si - h bond length is 1.50  .",
    "the optimized c - c and c - h bond length in graphane is 1.54 and 1.11  , respectively .",
    "the c - c bond length in graphane is almost identical to its value in bulk diamond , and it is also in agreement with the previous theoretical results on graphane .",
    "@xcite    2 unit cell is marked in the top view.,width=302 ]    because its silicon or carbon atoms are sp@xmath2 hybridized , both planar polysilane and grphane have a significant energy gap ( figure [ fig : band - si - c - h ] ) . in agreement with hirayama et",
    "al.,@xcite we obtained a quasi - direct band gap about 2.20 ev for two dimensional polysilane , with the valance band maximum ( vbm ) at the @xmath8 point and the conduction band minimum(cbm ) at the m point .",
    "the direct band gap at the @xmath8 point is just 0.12 ev broader .",
    "graphane has an about 3.43 ev direct gap at @xmath8 , as also suggested by sofo et al .",
    "@xcite     point .",
    "( d ) band structure of graphane , and corresponding charge densities of ( e ) the vbm and ( f ) the cbm at the @xmath8 point . in the band structures , occupied bands",
    "are in black , and unoccupied bands are in blue.,width=302 ]    the vbm of polysilane is a si - si bonding state . due to symmetry , it is two - fold degenerated at the @xmath8 point .",
    "the conduction band edge at @xmath8 point is the antibonding state between si 3p@xmath9 and h 1s orbitals , mainly distributed on si .",
    "vbm of graphane have similar bonding character with planar polysilane . however , cbm state of graphane is notably different from that of ploysilane , where a strongly delocalized feature exists above and blow the graphane plane .",
    "such a delocalized state is known as nfe state .",
    "@xcite when it is pushed to the band edge , nfe state becomes a determining factor of the width of band gap .",
    "we note that the nfe - like character of its cbm state has not been noticed in previous study on graphane .",
    "@xcite    why cbm of graphane is an nfe state , while that of polysilane is not ?",
    "one reason is that the antibonding states of graphane are higher in energy than those of planar polysilane . on the other hand , nfe states of graphane",
    "are also strongly stabilized compared to those of planar polysilane . in fact , at the @xmath8 point , the lowest nfe states of polysilane and graphane locate at about 0.7 and 1.4 ev below the vaccum level , respectively .",
    "there are two possible reasons for the stabilization of the nfe states in graphane .",
    "first , compared to notably negatively charged hydrogen in polysilane , hydrogen atoms in graphane are almost neutral .",
    "a negatively charged surface is repulsive to electrons , and thus upshift nfe states .",
    "second , the radius of carbon is smaller than silicon , which leads to a much smoother graphane surface than the polysilane surface . actually , the distance between two hydrogen atoms in graphane is 1.35   shorter than that in polysilane .",
    "a smoother surface is expected to stabilize nfe states .",
    "fluorine has a much larger electronegativity than hydrogen .",
    "therefore , the substitution of hydrogen in planar polysilane by fluorine may lead to a significant electronic structure modification .",
    "we first consider the simplest case where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms ( 100% f coverage ) .",
    "f substitution does not change the si - si bond length , and the optimized si - f bond length is 1.63  .    the band structure of f - substituted polysilane ( fig . [",
    "fig : sif-4band]d ) is very different from the unsubstituted system .",
    "the band gap ( 0.62 ev ) becomes much smaller , and it is a direct gap at the @xmath8 point .",
    "therefore , f - substituted polysilane will have a much higher luminous efficiency than bulk silicon .",
    "cbm of f - substituted polysilane at the @xmath8 point is mainly an antibonding state between si and f molecular orbitals .",
    "similar to siloxene , @xcite the indirect gap to direct gap transition from unsubstituted to substituted polysilane may caused by stronger mixing with f 2_s _ state at @xmath8 point , which pushes down the cbm at @xmath8 to lower than the local minimum at the m point .",
    "vbm is still mainly a si - si bonding state .",
    "however , compared to planar polysilane ( figure [ fig : band - si - c - h]c ) , there is a small hybridization with the f 2_s _ orbital .",
    "it is also interesting to check the electronic structure evolution with the f coverage . using a 2@xmath52 supercell",
    ", we consider 25% , 50% , and , 75% f substitutions , which corresponds to 2 , 4 , and 6 fluorine atoms in the supercell , respectively . for 25% and 75%",
    "f coverages , we consider all possible f substitution configurations . for 50% f coverage ,",
    "6 configurations are considered .",
    "all calculated configurations for different f concentrations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sif+cf ] .",
    "the energetically most stable configuration with different f coverage is 25-c , 50-c , and 75-c , respectively .",
    "however , the energy difference between different configurations for a certain f concentration is very small , typically within 0.1 ev . at the same time , with a certain f coverage , configuration difference has little effect on the band structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sif-4band ] , band gap decreases with the increase of the f coverage ( table [ tb2:b ] ) .    in all configurations",
    ", cbm is mainly of antibonding character between si - f or si - h molecular orbitals .",
    "since the si - f antibonding state is lower in energy than the si - h antibonding state ( refer to the 100% f coverage case and the unsubstituted case ) , more weight of si - f antibonding character leads to lower energy of the band .",
    "therefore , as the percent of f substitutions increases , the energy of cbm significantly decreases .",
    "vbm of fluorinated polysilane is a si - si bonding state with a small hybridization with f orbitals .",
    "the energy of vbm also slightly decrease with the f coverage , which can be understand by charge transfer between si and f. since fluorine has a larger electronegativity than silicon , an electron - transfer from si to f is expected .",
    "charge population bader analysis shows that the amount of electrons transfer from si to f increases with the increase of the f concentration ( table [ tb2:b ] ) .",
    "as vbm is mainly a si - si bonding state , a positively charged si skeleton will push down the vbm . because the downshift of cbm is more significant than vbm",
    ", we still get smaller bang gap for strongly fluorinated polysilane .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sioh+sinh2 ] , the energy gap is also decrease with the increase of the functional - group coverage for both oh and nh@xmath0 functionalized polysilane ( table [ tb6:c ] ) .",
    "however , contrast with the f substitution case , vbm rise with the increase of the functional - group coverage .",
    "this may due to stronger mixing between si - si bonding states and n or o 2@xmath10 orbitals , since they are higher than f 2@xmath10 orbital and more close to the si @xmath11 orbital .",
    "the strong hybridization between si and o or n orbitals is consistent with the split vbm , which is degenerated in fluorinated polysilane .",
    "cbm at the @xmath8 point is mainly of the antibonding character between si - o or si - n molecular orbitals .",
    "covered planar polysilane.,width=302 ]    for both oh and nh@xmath0 doped graphane , we obtain a smaller gap for the 50% coverage compared to the 100% case .",
    "this is because the nfe state on the hydrogen atom in the 50% coverage case is lowered by the dipole layer developed in the system .",
    "in all four cases , vbm is a c - c bonding state mixed with o or n 2_p _ orbitals .",
    "the mixing is very strong , which leads to an even larger splitting of vbm at the @xmath8 point compared to oh or nh@xmath0 substituted planar polysilane .",
    "the position of vbm is almost not affected by the functional group coverage , which indicate that the n and o 2_p _ orbitals are close in energy to the c - c bonding state .",
    "covered graphane.,width=302 ]    cbm of 100% oh covered graphane is also the antibonding states of c and o molecular orbitals .",
    "but for 100% nh@xmath0 covered graphane , cbm has a significant nfe - like character due to the hydrogen atoms in the radicals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnh2-cbm ] ) .",
    "such kind of nfe states provide more flexibility to use nfe state to tune the electronic and optical properties of two - dimensional materials .",
    "covered graphane.,width=94 ]",
    "in summary , we have calculated the on - plane chemical modification of two dimensional polysilane and graphane .",
    "chemical functionalization can change the indirect gap in planar polysilane to a direct gap , which will strongly modify the optical properties of the system . for fluorinated polysilane ,",
    "the gap decreases with the f coverage , independent on the f adsorption configurations .",
    "however , the electronic structure of fluorinated graphane is sensitively dependent on the f doping geometry .",
    "this is because the nfe states of graphane is close to the conduction band edge .",
    "energy of nfe states is more sensitive to the local vacuum potential and the doping structure .",
    "functionalization by oh and nh@xmath0 groups is also discussed .",
