    "the partition functions of three - dimensional chern - simons theories show various interesting aspects of m2-branes .",
    "the would - volume theory of @xmath2 m2-branes on @xmath3 is described by an @xmath4 superconformal chern - simons theory called abjm theory @xcite , which has a gauge group u@xmath5u@xmath6 ( with the subscripts denoting the chern - simons levels ) and two pairs of bifundamental matters connecting the two u@xmath7 factors .",
    "due to the progress in the supersymmetric localization @xcite , the partition function on a sphere is reduced to a matrix model with a finite - dimensional multiple integral .",
    "one of the major developments is the full determination of the partition function of the abjm theory in the large @xmath2 expansion , including the perturbative @xcite and non - perturbative @xcite effects . in the study , among others , it is interesting to find that the matrix model has several interpretations . on one hand , it can be superficially regarded as the pure chern - simons matrix model with an unconventional super gauge group u@xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the matrix model can be regarded as the partition function of a fermi gas system @xcite @xmath9 with a non - trivial density matrix @xmath10 which is closely related to the quantum mechanical system associated to the local @xmath11 geometry @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to ask whether we can generalize the results to theories with a large number of supersymmetries .",
    "expansion is known , see @xcite for the @xmath12 model and @xcite for the local @xmath13 model .",
    "] one direction is the generalization to the matrix model with a superficial gauge group u@xmath14 @xcite where two factors of the bosonic subgroup have different ranks and the physical interpretation of the difference is the introduction of fractional m2-branes @xcite . in studying the partition function with the deformation @xcite , there are two formulations . the first one , called closed string formalism in @xcite , changes the expression of the density matrix @xmath15 while preserving the trace structure .",
    "this formalism was first conjectured in @xcite and then proved in @xcite . partially due to the lack of a proof of the formalism for a long time , in @xcite another formalism , called open string formalism ,",
    "was proposed .",
    "this formalism , on the other hand , keeps the expression of the density matrix , while modifying the trace structure with an extra determinant factor .",
    "another direction is the replacement of the unitary supergroup by the orthosymplectic supergroup @xcite , whose physical interpretation is the introduction of the orientifold plane in the type iib description .",
    "the study of the partition function was initiated in @xcite by the case of osp@xmath16 with equal sizes of bosonic submatrices from the expectation that the case without the fractional branes should play a fundamental role . among others",

    "the chirally projected density matrices @xmath18_\\pm = \\widehat\\rho_{\\text{u}(n|n)}\\frac{1\\pm\\widehat r}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] were introduced in @xcite with @xmath19 being the reflection operator changing the sign of the coordinate .",
    "then , it was found that when we double the quivers following the prescription in @xcite , the partition function schematically reduces to the abjm partition function .",

    "the first part of this paper is devoted to answering this question .",
    "we have found that , when we deform the theory into that with a superficial gauge group osp@xmath22 ( or osp@xmath23 which shares the same partition function ) , the density matrix is again exactly the odd projection of the density matrix for the theory with a superficial unitary gauge group u@xmath24 : @xmath25_- . \\label{oddprojm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see figure [ oddpic ] for a schematic picture explaining the relation .",
    "we stress that the relation gives a fermi gas formalism for the osp@xmath22 theory , which enables the study of the grand potential and its relation to topological string theory .",
    "our manipulations start with an expression rather similar to the open string formalism @xcite .",
    "it is useful to keep the determinant factor coming from the open string formalism to see many cancellations in the expressions . after performing a similarity transformation and an integration of delta functions",

    "there is a physical bound @xcite stating that @xmath26 . instead of @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , the number of d5-branes in the brane construction of @xcite is @xmath28 in our convention . ]",
    "it is interesting to find that our relation between these two theories is consistent with the bound .",
    "we stress that , although we are influenced by the work of @xcite , it seems difficult to arrive at our proof of the relation if we simply follow the change of variables in @xcite .",
    "following the observation , in the second part , we turn to the study of the simplest @xmath29 case , the osp@xmath20 theory , which is equivalent to the abjm u@xmath8 theory with the odd chiral projection .",

    "we find an interesting functional relation stating that the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is extremely simple for integral @xmath28 , with an explicit relation expressed in @xmath28 mod @xmath33 as in the case of the osp@xmath16 theory @xcite .",

    "next , let us consider the matrix elements in in front of the determinant .",
    "for the first product , after the similarity transformations which changes @xmath86 into @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 where we have explicitly spelled out the matrix element @xmath89 .",
    "for the second product , we have @xmath90 there is a subtlety on the definition of this integral which will be clarified at the end of this section . for the moment , we perform the gaussian integral formally @xmath91 as a result , all the @xmath35 integrations can be done explicitly due to the delta functions in and .",
    "there are further simplifications . since the remaining determinant in the integrand is an odd function of @xmath35 , we can simply replace the matrix elements discussed above as @xmath92    after substituting these replacements and taking care of the extra phase factors , the partition function is given by @xmath93 _ { ( i , j)\\in z_n\\times z_n } & \\bigl[\\langle\\mu_i|n\\operatorname{\\!\\rangle\\!\\rangle}\\bigr ] _ { ( i , n)\\in z_n\\times",

    "let us now return to the subtlety in .",
    "one way to regularize the integral is to insert @xmath104 into with an infinitesimal parameter @xmath105 and rotate the integration contour clockwise .",

    "of course , such a manipulation is allowed only if the integration contour of @xmath111 does not pick up any finite residues in the rotation .",
    "possible residues might come from poles of the matrix element @xmath112 in the determinant in , which are located at @xmath113 with integral @xmath114 , or more concisely @xmath115 , as can be seen from the expression . on the other hand",
    ", our computation for the regularized expression shows that the residues in the region @xmath116 and @xmath117 are accompanied by a vanishing factor in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "since the index @xmath55 runs over @xmath118 and the consistency of the @xmath119 theory requires @xmath120 , only poles in the region @xmath121 are relevant .",
    "therefore , we are allowed to use the formal expression in the proof .",
    "in the previous section , we have established the relation between the density matrix for the orthosymplectic osp@xmath22 ( or osp@xmath23 ) matrix model and that for the unitary u@xmath24 matrix model with the projection to the odd chirality . here",

    "was already stressed in @xcite , there has not been a strong motivation to study them carefully theories with the chiral projections are studied @xcite in the expectation of its physical relevance .",

    ", we shall study the non - perturbative effects of @xmath32 carefully .",
    "we point out a functional relation between the grand potentials with the chiral projections @xmath30 , from which the membrane instantons due to the chiral projections are determined .",
    "then , we further turn to the study of the worldsheet instantons in @xmath32 .",
    "we first define the grand potentials constructed from the density matrices with the chiral projections @xmath122 the perturbative part of each grand potential is given by a cubic polynomial @xmath123 with the coefficients related to those of the abjm theory by @xmath124 which results in the airy function as in the full case @xcite .",
    "our observation is that the non - perturbative part of the difference between the even and odd grand potentials @xmath30 looks quite simple for integral @xmath28 . after extracting the perturbative terms by @xmath125 we find that the non - perturbative terms of the difference @xmath126 satisfy @xmath127 from the numerical fitting . for the reader",
    "s convenience , we present in the appendix the exact values of the partition functions and the grand potentials found from the numerical fitting .",
