    "<S> @xcite as a particular example , recent experiments @xcite on quantum hall ( qh ) edge states driven out of equilibrium at a quantum point contact ( qpc ) provide very detailed information on the approach to a steady state in an electron system that appears to be well - isolated from other degrees of freedom . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we describe the exact solution of a simple model for these experiments and compare our results with the measurements .    in outline , </S>",
    "<S> the experiments we are concerned with @xcite involve two sets of integer qh edge states , which meet at a qpc . when a bias voltage is applied to the qpc </S>",
    "<S> , tunneling between the edge states generates a non - equilibrium electron distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the form of this distribution in energy and its evolution as a function of distance downstream from the qpc are probed by monitoring the tunneling current from a point on the edge , through a quantum dot that has an isolated level of controllable energy . </S>",
    "<S> close to the qpc , the measured distribution has two steps , reflecting the different energies of fermi steps in each of the incident edges . with increasing distance from the qpc , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution relaxes to a single , broad step . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical challenge presented by these observations is to understand and model this relaxation process .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between these edge state experiments and other recent work on many - body quantum dynamics far from equilibrium has several aspects worth emphasising . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the context of qh edge states , these are the most recent of a series of striking observations of non - equilibrium effects in interferometers @xcite and in thermal transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are also the equivalent for a ballistic system of earlier studies diffusive of local distributions in diffusive wires . </S>",
    "<S> second , the measurements stand apart from earlier theory @xcite and experiment @xcite on non - equilibrium transport between fractional qh edge states , because they probe local distribution functions , rather than the global non - linear current - voltage characteristic . </S>",
    "<S> third , and more broadly , the system studied is different in important ways from quantum impurity problems @xcite , as there is no impurity degree of freedom and interactions are not confined to an impurity site but instead operate in the ingoing and outgoing channels . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , there is an analogy between edge state relaxation and cold atom experiments in the time domain @xcite , since distance from the qpc translates roughly as time , using the edge state velocity as a conversion factor . in that sense </S>",
    "<S> the experiment we consider , probing relaxation as electrons propagate , is equivalent to a quantum quench @xcite , in which time evolution is studied following a sudden change in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> an important question in this context is whether a system thermalises at long times . </S>",
    "<S> since integrability is an obstacle to thermalisation , it is noteworthy that the conventional model @xcite of a qh edge state as a chiral luttinger liquid is an integrable one .    </S>",
    "<S> any attempt to model theoretically the experiments of ref .   starting from a chiral luttinger liquid description faces an obvious difficulty , since interactions are most naturally described in terms of collective modes using bosonization , but tunnelling at the qpc is simple only in terms of fermionic variables . in pioneering work , </S>",
    "<S> two alternative approaches have been developed : one based on a boltzmann - like equation for the electron distribution @xcite ; and the other using a phenomenological model for the plasmon distribution generated at the qpc @xcite . from @xcite , and from subsequent discussion of a quantum quench in an isolated qh edge ( with an initial state chosen to emulate the effects of a qpc ) by the present authors @xcite , a physical picture has emerged , in which relaxation is seen as a consequence of plasmon dispersion or the presence at @xmath1 of two plasmon modes with distinct velocities . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> an electron that tunnels at the qpc can be viewed as a superposition of plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> dispersion or multiple plasmon velocities cause such a wavepacket to broaden as it propagates . </S>",
    "<S> the lengthscale for relaxation of the electron distribution downstream from the qpc is the distance at which the width of this wavepacket is comparable to the characteristic separation between tunnelling electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the argument identifies relevant scales but does not generate a prediction for the electron distribution and its dependence on distance from the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> one of our main aims here is to calculate this central quantity .    </S>",
    "<S> an overview of our treatment is as follows : we make key use of the fact that , since experiments are at landau level filling factor @xmath2 , each qh edge carries two co - propagating channels . </S>",
    "<S> interactions mix excitations in different channels , and in the minimal model eigenmodes are charactised using two velocities . </S>",
    "<S> our approach combines refermionisation fabrizio , zarand with non - equilibrium bosonization methods cazalilla , gutman , lknoneq , mzprb , ls2011 : by first bosonizing , then recombining bosons to form a new set of fermions , we transform the hamiltonian for the interacting system into one for free particles . under this transformation , the measured distribution ( or more accurately </S>",
    "<S> , the spectral function probed by the tunnelling conductance ) is expressed as a free - fermion determinant . </S>",
    "<S> this determinant has a form similar to that appearing in the the theory @xcite of full counting statistics [ fcs ] , and related quantities appear in a variety of other non - equilibrium problems @xcite . its numerical evaluation can be done accurately and efficiently , yielding the results we present below . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , simple analytical expressions can be found for some quantities , and we give one for the total energy in each channel as a function of distance from the qpc , thus providing a hamiltonian derivation of a result obtained previously in the phenomenological treatment of ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> the work we set out here is related in a variety of ways to other studies of devices built from integer qh edge states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , experiments that revealed striking non - equilibrium effects in mach zehnder interferometers @xcite have stimulated extensive theoretical research , @xcite including calculations @xcite of interferometer dephasing based on the same bosonized model @xcite for edge states at @xmath1 with contact interactions that we adopt in the following . </S>",
    "<S> in the context of edge state relaxation a parallel development to the present paper , described in ref .  , is based on an approximation ( involving a factorisation of bosonic correlators ) that is expected to be accurate sufficiently far from the qpc . </S>",

    "<S> we now use these equations to discuss the physics of relaxation in this system and to calculate the tunnelling conductance .    a simple physical picture of the relaxation process , and an identification of relevant length scales , follows from the form of eq .  ( [ g ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> four parameters enter the calculations : @xmath53 , @xmath57 , @xmath19 and the tunneling probability @xmath58 at the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one further parameter is needed to set the energy scale for the data : the gate voltage - to - energy lever arm @xmath59 ( defined in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we fix @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( consistent with the values determined in refs .   and ) and obtain the bath temperature @xmath63 ( close to the experimental value of @xmath64 ) by fitting data at zero bias voltage to a thermal fermi - dirac distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare numerical results at large @xmath52 with data measured in the @xmath65 channel at the maximum distance from the qpc ( @xmath66 @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a good fit at @xmath68 , and use this value for computations shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] at all other @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> both values of @xmath74 are 25% lower than the experimental ones , and this discrepancy is consistent with the ` missing energy ' reported in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> possible interpretations of this discrepancy include loss of energy at the qpc or the existence of additional , neutral edge modes,@xcite or invoke @xcite the distinction in an interacting system between the measured spectral function and the electron distribution in energy . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we obtain good fits to all data except that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] for the smallest @xmath52 suggests that , if energy is lost from the edge modes in the experimental system , this probably happens very close to the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant outcome from this fitting process is a value for the interaction parameter : @xmath75ms@xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> a roughly comparable result ( @xmath77ms@xmath76 ) was obtained from the same data in ref . , but we believe our fitting procedure is more precise . both determinations are in the range measured for edge state velocities in gated samples.@xcite    an additional quantity of interest is the energy density @xmath78 in channel @xmath79 : it characterises with a single value the electron distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can evaluate it explicitly from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g ] ) because ( see ref .  ) </S>",
    "<S> it is proportional to @xmath80 and @xmath81 has an expansion for small @xmath42 in cumulants of @xmath82 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) , derived using a different approach in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , shows that the energy densities interpolate between values just after the qpc of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and values at large @xmath52 of @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation length is set by the smaller of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
