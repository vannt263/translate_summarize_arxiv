    "it is well known that the large momentum transfer processes play an important role in testing the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) because the asymptotic freedom property allows us to apply the perturbative techniques to make predictions for processes that are dominated by short - distance interactions . in hadronic collisions , since photons couple in a pointlike fashion to the quark constituents of the colliding hadrons , they provide an excellent probe for such purposes  @xcite .",
    "the study of prompt photons ( photons not originating from meson decays ) is also very useful to obtain direct information on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , especially for the gluon  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been established that prompt photon production in association with a heavy quark ( either charm or bottom ) can be used for searching the intrinsic heavy quark components of the nucleon  @xcite .    in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the production of photons is recognized as an important tool  @xcite to study the fundamental properties of deconfined , strongly interacting matter , namely , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite created in these collisions .",
    "actually , photons can provide information on the whole time evolution and dynamics of the medium because they are not accompanied by any final - state interaction .",
    "for example , measuring their transverse momentum distribution can be used to estimate the temperature of the system .",
    "it is worth noting that , in nucleus - nucleus collisions , direct photons come from a variety of different sources and can be divided into two categories : thermal photons that have a thermal origin and prompt photons coming from cold processes . usually , prompt photons are considered as a background to thermal photons when we are looking for signals of the qgp .",
    "thermal photons dominate the direct photon spectrum at low photon transverse momentum @xmath1 , while prompt photons are the dominant photon source at high @xmath1 .",
    "although in heavy - ion collisions there is no straightforward way to distinguish between thermal and prompt photons experimentally , the fact that different processes are dominant at different @xmath1 can help us to unfold the different contributions to the total observed yields .",
    "the measurement of direct photons in heavy - ion collisions has been performed so far in many experiments  @xcite . for gold - gold collisions , one can refer , for example , to the phenix collaboration measurements at center - of - mass energy of @xmath2 gev where the photons have the transverse momentum @xmath3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the alice collaboration has reported the first measurement of a low-@xmath4 direct photon at the lhc from lead - lead collisions at @xmath5 tev  @xcite .",
    "such measurements have also been done by phenix in au - au collisions at the rhic  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of prompt photon production at the lhc has also been performed by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations in lead - lead collisions at @xmath5 tev in the ranges @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 gev , respectively .",
    "note that in these kinematic regions , photons are expected to be dominantly produced in hard partonic collisions . for the case of d - au collisions , we only have the phenix measurement at @xmath2 gev  @xcite . despite all of these experimental efforts",
    ", there is still no measurement of direct photon production in @xmath0-a collisions , though the alice measurement in @xmath0-pb collisions will be reported in the near future  @xcite .    in order to calculate cross sections in any nuclear collision",
    ", one needs to know the structure of the colliding nuclei .",
    "this structure can be described by nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) , similar to the pdfs in the case of hadron structure .",
    "the required nuclear parton densities can be extracted using the nuclear experimental data and dglap evolution equations within the collinear factorization  @xcite .",
    "however , npdfs can not be well determined using the available nuclear deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan experimental data compared to the free nucleon pdfs .",
    "consequently , the obtained npdfs from different global analyses by various groups  @xcite have some considerable differences , both in behavior and uncertainty .",
    "this can lead to different results for predictions of physical observables that are sensitive to npdfs .",
    "since in nuclear collisions , prompt photons are produced in hard scatterings of incoming partons , they can provide some information on parton densities in nuclei especially for the gluon pdf  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we investigate the impact of various recent npdfs and their uncertainties on the theoretical predictions of isolated prompt photon production in @xmath0-pb collisions at the lhc .",

    "[ sec : three ] , we briefly describe the physics of prompt photon production .",
    "particular attention is paid to its main concepts such as involved leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) subprocesses , direct and fragmentation components of the cross section and the definition of isolation cut .",
    "the isolated prompt photon production in @xmath8 and @xmath0-pb collisions at forward rapidity at the lhc is studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : four ] .",
    "the differential cross sections are calculated as functions of @xmath1 using various modern pdf and npdf sets to estimate the order of magnitude of the difference between their predictions .",
    "[ sec : five ] is devoted to studying the theoretical uncertainties in the differential cross section of isolated prompt photon production due to various sources . in sec .",
    "[ sec : six ] , we calculate and compare the nuclear modification ratio @xmath9 and the yield asymmetry between the forward and backward rapidities @xmath10 using different nuclear modifications . finally , we summarize our results and conclusions in sec .",

    "the accurate determination of pdfs is crucial for all calculations of high - energy processes with initial hadrons , whether within the standard model ( sm ) or when exploring new physics .",
    "it is well known that the pdfs are nonperturbative objects , and one needs to extract them from the global fits to hard - scattering data .",
    "the reason for this is that they can not be determined from the first principles of qcd , although their scale dependence is determined by the perturbative dglap evolution equations .",
    "nowadays , global analyses of pdfs are performed using a large number of available precise experimental data from the dis , drell - yan , and collider experiments , and our knowledge of the quark and gluon substructure of the nucleon has been improved to a large extent . consequently , the extracted pdfs by different analyst groups  @xcite are satisfactorily accurate and also in a good agreement with each other . however , there are still some variations in both their central values and uncertainties especially in the case of gluon and sea quarks",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows a comparison between the gluon distributions from the recent well - known phenomenological groups namely , ct14",
    "@xcite , mmht14  @xcite , and nnpdf3.0  @xcite .",
    "we have plotted their nlo results in terms of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath12 at two low ( top panel ) and high ( bottom panel ) scales @xmath132 and 100 gev@xmath11 .",
    "the comparison has been made as the ratio to ct14 ( as a reference pdf set ) including pdf uncertainties to make the differences between the results more clear .",
    "as can be seen , the predictions of these groups for the gluon distribution differ significantly in some values of @xmath12 .",
    "most differences occur in the small and large @xmath12 regions .",
    "regardless of these regions , it may be of interest that the nnpdf3.0 has a significant enhancement at @xmath12 of about 0.1 .",
    "another conclusion that can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] is that the gluon distribution from the ct14 has a greater uncertainty ( blue band ) than the mmht14 ( red band ) and nnpdf3.0 ( green band ) in all values of @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to the pdfs , the results obtained for the npdfs are not very satisfying due to the lack of experimental data .",
    "in fact , since the current npdf analyses  @xcite are mainly constrained by dis and drell - yan data , only the quark nuclear modifications at fairly large values of @xmath12 can be controlled as well .",
    "although the nuclear gluon distributions can be constrained indirectly via dglap evolution at higher orders of perturbation theory , we know that it is not enough for making accurate theoretical predictions of physical observables that are sensitive to the gluon density . in this way , some phenomenological groups have used the inclusive pion production data from d - au collisions at rhic in addition to the dis and drell - yan data .",
    "very recently , eskola _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have also used the lhc proton - lead data in their analysis . however , due to the limited kinematic reach of data , the gluon modifications and also their uncertainties obtained by various groups are very different in almost all values of @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noted that , at the moment , there is only one analysis including the lhc @xmath0-pb data .",
    "there are different approaches for determining the bound - proton pdfs .",
    "usually , they are defined in terms of nuclear modifications @xmath14 . to be more precise ,",
    "@xmath14 are the scale - dependent ratios between the pdf of a proton inside a nucleus , @xmath15 , and that in the free proton , @xmath16 , @xmath17 this approach has been used in the eps09  @xcite , dssz  @xcite , hkn07  @xcite , ka15  @xcite and epps16  @xcite analyses .",
    "note that , in this method , the extracted nuclear modifications are dependent on the chosen pdfs of the free proton .",
    "for example , the hkn07 and eps09 npdfs are based on the mrst1998 free - proton  @xcite and cteq6.1 m  @xcite sets , respectively .",
    "however , there is another approach used by the ncteq group  @xcite in which the npdf parametrisations do not rely on a factorisation into a nuclear modification factor and free - proton pdfs .",
    "actually , in this approach , the npdfs are parametrised directly as a function of @xmath12 at the starting scale @xmath18 , and then an explicit @xmath19 dependence is introduced in the coefficients of their functional form .",
    "it should be mentioned here that to obtain bound - neutron pdfs , one must assume the isospin symmetry .",
    "so , for the average up ( @xmath20 ) and down ( @xmath21 ) quark pdfs in a nucleus @xmath19 with @xmath22 protons , we have @xmath23    2 ( top panel ) and 100 ( bottom panel ) gev@xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] 2 ( top panel ) and 100 ( bottom panel ) gev@xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the nuclear modifications eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] can be divided into four areas as a function of @xmath12 . a suppression for @xmath24 that is commonly referred to as shadowing .",

    "the emc effect , a depletion at @xmath26 ; and finally fermi motion region in which again @xmath14 undergoes an excess towards @xmath27 .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows a comparison between the nuclear modifications of the gluon pdf in a pb - nucleus with their uncertainties from the ncteq15  @xcite ( blue band ) , eps09  @xcite ( red band ) , dssz  @xcite ( green band ) and hkn07  @xcite ( pink band ) at @xmath132 ( top panel ) and 100 ( bottom panel ) gev@xmath11 .",
    "one can clearly see that there are remarkable differences between their central values and uncertainties almost in whole ranges of @xmath12 . among them ,",
    "the ncteq15 shows stronger shadowing , antishadowing and emc effect .",
    "moreover , its prediction has wider error band than other groups in all values of @xmath12 .",
    "the eps09 has a similar treatment to ncteq15 but somewhat milder and also with less uncertainty .",
    "although the dssz dose not show the shadowing in small values of @xmath12 at @xmath132 gev@xmath11 , it appears in higher values of @xmath28 due to the evolution effects .",
    "nevertheless , the gluon shadowing in dssz is very small just like the antishadowing , emc effect and fermi motion , so the dssz prediction for the gluon nuclear modification of the lead nucleus stays around 1 in all regions .",
    "another interesting point that can be gained from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is that the hkn07 does not show the emc effect neither for low nor high @xmath28 values . in conclusion , one can expect that these differences lead to the different results for predictions of physical observables that are sensitive to the gluon density and so the gluon nuclear modification . note that for the lhc with high values of center - of - mass energy @xmath29 , depending on the transverse momentum @xmath4 and pseudorapidity @xmath30 of photons , various @xmath12 regions can be explored in the target and the projectile .",
    "actually , with the naive lo @xmath31 kinematics , the momentum fractions typically probed by direct photon production are @xmath32 therefore , for a given @xmath29 and @xmath4 , and for the case in which @xmath30 increases , the process becomes sensitive to parton densities at smaller @xmath33 ( target ) and larger @xmath34 ( projectile ) . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the physics of the prompt photon production in the lhc collisions as an excellent probe for the gluon distribution of the proton and its corresponding nuclear modification .",
    "for more than three decades , many studies have been done on the prompt photon production  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the prompt photon physics and related topics . by definition ,  prompt photons \" are those photons that arise from processes during the collision and are not produced from the decay of hadrons , such as @xmath35 , @xmath30 , etc . produced at large transverse momenta .",
    "forward prompt photons consist of two types of photons : direct and fragmentation photons .",
    "direct photons that behave as high-@xmath4 colorless partons are produced predominantly from the initial hard scattering processes of the colliding quarks or gluons .",
    "fragmentation photons behave as a kind of hadron , i.e. they are produced as bremsstrahlung emitted by a scattered parton , from the fragmentation of high-@xmath4 quarks and gluons which are produced in primary hard partonic collisions or from the interaction of a scattered parton with the medium created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "although the direct and fragmentation components of the prompt photon cross section described above can not be measured separately in the experiments , the theoretical calculations can be performed completely separately . in this way",
    ", the cross section for the inclusive prompt photon production in a collision of hadrons @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be written generally as follows @xmath38 where d and f refer to the direct and fragmentation parts , respectively , and @xmath39 indicates the inclusive nature of the cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "using collinear factorization  @xcite , the cross section for the inclusive production of a hard elementary particle @xmath40 in @xmath41 collisions can be calculated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the pdfs of parton species @xmath45 and @xmath46 inside the projectile ( @xmath36 ) and target ( @xmath47 ) , respectively , at momentum fractions @xmath34 and @xmath33 and factorization scale @xmath48 of the initial - state parton distributions . in the above equation , @xmath49 is a convolution integral over @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the partonic pieces @xmath50 denoted by @xmath48 , renormalization scale @xmath51 and factorization scale @xmath52 of the photon fragmentation function can be calculated as a perturbative expansion in the strong ( @xmath53 ) and electroweak ( @xmath54 ) couplings ( note that the partonic pieces @xmath50 do not have any dependence on the factorization scale @xmath52 in the born approximation . however , such dependence appears in the calculation of the higher - order corrections to both the direct and fragmentation components from which final - state collinear singularities have been subtracted according to the @xmath55 factorization scheme  @xcite . ) as usual , @xmath56 indicates that in the calculation of @xmath50 , we must integrate over everything else but the photon .",
    "then , we can calculate the direct component of the prompt photon production cross section in eq .",
    "using eq .   and assuming particle @xmath40 as a photon @xmath57 .",
    "the experimentally measured prompt photons also include the fragmentation photons emitted through collinear fragmentation of a parton that is itself produced with a large transverse momentum .",
    "the fragmentation component of the prompt photon production cross section in eq .   can be calculated as follows @xmath58 in this equation , @xmath59 is the parton - to - photon fragmentation function ( ff ) where @xmath60 is the fractional momentum over which the last convolution is taken .",
    "actually , in the calculation of the fragmentation contribution , occurrence of some singularities including a final - state quark - photon collinear singularity or final - state multiple collinear singularities at higher orders is inevitable .",
    "these singularities are resummed and absorbed into ffs of the photons . in this case , since the fragmentation functions behave roughly as @xmath61  @xcite , the perturbatively calculable pieces related to the partonic subprocesses , @xmath50 , can be of the order of @xmath62 for lo and @xmath63 for nlo parton production .",
    "consequently , the fragmentation contributions of the cross section remain of the same order as the direct contributions .",
    "now we are in a position to introduce all partonic subprocesses that contribute to the prompt photon production cross section at lo and nlo approximation . at lo , there are two born - level subprocesses : the compton scattering @xmath64 and annihilation @xmath65 .",
    "the importance of these subprocesses clearly depends on the type of collisions .",
    "actually , in @xmath8 collisions at rhic and lhc , the @xmath66 annihilation channel has a small contribution to the cross sections in all kinematic regions , whereas at the tevatron this channel is also considerable . at nlo , there are more contributing subprocesses including @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and other subprocesses from the virtual corrections to the born - level processes .",
    "it is worth pointing out in this context that since at the lhc the @xmath66 annihilation is suppressed compared to other subprocesses , and on the other hand , the gluon distribution is dominant rather than the sea quark distributions at small @xmath12 , the prompt photon production provides direct information on the proton gluon distribution .",
    "it should also be taken into account that because of the high center - of - mass energy , the photon production at the lhc probes values of @xmath12 that are considerably smaller than at the tevatron .    in order to reject the background of photons coming from the decays of hadrons such as @xmath35",
    ", @xmath30 produced in the collision that are not considered as prompt photons by definition , an isolation criterion is required .",
    "various isolation criteria have been used so far in related studies  @xcite . the most common criterion which can be also implementable at the partonic level",
    "is the cone criterion  @xcite . according to the cone isolation criterion ,",
    "a photon is considered as an isolated photon if , in a cone of radius @xmath69 in rapidity @xmath70 and azimuthal angle @xmath71 around the photon direction , @xmath72 the amount of accompanying hadronic transverse energy @xmath73 is smaller than some finite value @xmath74 , @xmath75 both @xmath69 and @xmath74 are chosen by the experiment and @xmath74 is presented as a fixed value or a fixed fraction of the transverse momentum of the photon @xmath1 or , more generally , as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "one of the main differences between the direct and fragmentation photons is that a direct photon will most probably be separated from the hadronic environment , whereas a fragmentation photon , except for the case in which the photon carries away most of the momentum of the fragmenting parton , is most probably accompanied by hadrons . in this way , since the isolation cut discards the prompt photon events that have too much hadronic activity around the photon , and on the other hand , the fragmentation photons are emitted collinearly to the parent parton , it is expected that the isolation cut reduces the fragmentation component . now , considering what was said above , in the next section , we calculate and study in detail the prompt photon production in @xmath8 and @xmath0-pb collisions at center - of - mass energy of @xmath76 tev and for the forward rapidities corresponding to the alice kinematics  @xcite .",
    "the lhc allows us to investigate the behaviour of sm particles in a qualitatively new energy region via measuring the production of various particles such as the @xmath77 and @xmath22 bosons in association with jets  @xcite or a heavy flavor quark  @xcite and also the isolated prompt photon whether inclusively  @xcite or in association with jets  @xcite . in the previous section , we presented main topics related to the prompt photon production in hadron collisions . in this section ,",
    "we present theoretical predictions for the isolated prompt photon production in @xmath8 and @xmath0-pb collisions at @xmath78 tev corresponding to the alice kinematics  @xcite .",
    "all calculations are performed here , and subsequent sections are based on the jetphox monte carlo program  @xcite which includes both direct and fragmentation processes and also allows us to study the isolation cut .",
    "we include all diagrams up to lo and nlo of qed and qcd coupling , respectively , defined in the @xmath55 renormalization scheme . within the jetphox framework ,",
    "it is also possible to compute direct and fragmentation parts as distinct , however , the nlo calculations are performed at the parton level and do not account for hadronization effects .",
    "it should be noted that , in our numerical calculations performed in this section and also sec .",
    "[ sec : six ] , we use set ii of the nlo bourhis - fontannaz - guillet ( bfg ) ffs of photons  @xcite for calculating the fragmentation component of the cross sections [ eq .  ] .",
    "moreover , the renormalization ( @xmath51 ) , factorization ( @xmath48 ) and fragmentation ( @xmath52 ) scales are set to the photon transverse momentum ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the ffs and scale uncertainties are studied separately in the next section in addition to the theoretical uncertainties due to npdfs . as a last point ,",
    "note that the fine - structure constant ( @xmath80 ) is set to the jetphox default of 1/137 .",
    "now we are in a position to calculate the isolated prompt photon production in @xmath8 collisions at @xmath78 tev theoretically , using various modern pdf sets ct14  @xcite , mmht14  @xcite and nnpdf3.0  @xcite introduced in sec .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] , measurements of isolated prompt photon production at the alice kinematics can be really helpful in constraining the gluon nuclear modifications and determining their best central values in the shadowing region . the differences between the various gluon modifications from different groups can be made more explicit if one calculates the minimum bias nuclear modification ratio for @xmath0-pb collisions and also the yield asymmetry between the forward and backward rapidities .",

    "[ sec : six ] . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the theoretical uncertainties in the differential cross section of isolated prompt photon production due to npdf , scale and ff uncertainties .",
    "in the previous section we calculated the cross section of isolated prompt photon production in @xmath0-pb collisions using various nuclear modifications of pdfs for the pb nucleus . now , it is important and also interesting to calculate the theoretical uncertainties in the results with respect to the various sources .",
    "the most important sources of uncertainties are the pdf , npdf , scale and ff uncertainties .",
    "since the theoretical uncertainties of the free - proton pdfs have been studied before in many papers concerning the isolated prompt photon production in @xmath8 collisions , and on the other hand , since we are interested here in @xmath0-pb collisions and thus the impact of npdfs on the cross section , we ignore the study of pdf uncertainties ( note , however , that pdfs have smaller uncertainties than npdfs ) .    to study the npdf uncertainties , we choose the nuclear modifications from the ncteq15  @xcite as our baseline which has greatest uncertainties in comparison with other groups according to fig .

    "as mentioned , we have set the renormalization , factorization and fragmentation scales as @xmath79 in all calculations performed in the previous section .",
    "although , no optimal scale choice is possible for the prediction of the inclusive photon cross section in the region of phase space of interest  @xcite , it is accepted that the predictions can be reliably made by this choice .",
    "moreover , we accept that the theoretical uncertainty due to scale variations can be calculated by changing these scales by a factor 2 and comparing the @xmath88 and @xmath89 results",
    ". however , the more correct method in the calculation of scale uncertainties is the combination of both incoherent and coherent scale variations . in this method",
    ", an incoherent variation means varying the scales independently by a factor of 2 around the central value so that one scale is varied while keeping the other two equal to @xmath1 , and a coherent variation means varying the scales simultaneously by a factor of 2 around the central value as before .",
    "finally , we can calculate the total scale uncertainty by adding in quadrature all obtained uncertainties .",
    "since , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , prompt photon production consists of both direct and fragmentation contributions , it is inevitably related to the ffs that appeared in the fragmentation component [ see eq .  ] .",
    "then , the part of the theoretical uncertainties in its cross section comes from the ffs uncertainties .",

    "<S> prompt photon production is known as a powerful tool for testing perturbative qcd predictions and also the validity of parton densities in the nucleon and nuclei especially of the gluon . in this work , we have performed a detailed study on this subject focusing on the isolated prompt photon production in @xmath0-pb collisions at forward rapidity at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of input nuclear modifications obtained from different global analyses by various groups on several quantities has been investigated to estimate the order of magnitude of the difference between their predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied in detail the theoretical uncertainties in the results due to various sources . </S>",
    "<S> we found that there is a remarkable difference between the predictions from the ncteq15 and other groups in all ranges of photon transverse momentum @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> their differences become more explicit in the calculation of the nuclear modification ratio and also the yield asymmetry between the forward and backward rapidities rather than single differential cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that future measurements with alice will be very useful not only for decreasing the uncertainty of the gluon nuclear modification , but also to accurately determine its central values , especially in the shadowing region . </S>"
