    "the lynds clouds l1615 and l1616 @xcite are both located at an angular distance of about @xmath6 west of the orion ob1 associations .",
    "these clouds actually form a cometary - shaped single cloud with a `` head - tail '' distribution subtending about @xmath7 ( 5.2  pc assuming a distance of 450  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) roughly in the east - west direction .",
    "the dense head of the cloud complex ( i.e. l1616 only ) , pointing toward east and facing the bright orion - belt stars , harbours the iras small scale structure x0504 - 034 @xcite and a bright reflection nebula , ngc1788 (= dg51 , ced40 , vdb33 , rno35 , lbn916 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is illuminated by a small cluster of stars @xcite .",
    "the two intermediate - mass stars hd293815 and kisoa-0974  15 are the brightest visible members of this cluster .",
    "l1615/l1616 , like many other cometary clouds off the main orion star forming regions , clearly shows evidence of ongoing star formation activity which might have been triggered by the strong impact of the uv radiation from the massive , luminous stars in the orion complex @xcite .",
    "the illumination of dense clumps in molecular clouds by ob stars could be responsible for their collapse and subsequent star formation .",
    "the uv radiation from the ob stars may sweep the molecular material of the cloud into a cometary shape with a dense core located at the head of the cometary cloud .",
    "the radiation and wind of ob stars may also have an important impact on the mass accretion during the star formation process .",
    "while in a t  association a protostar may accumulate a significant fraction of mass , the mass accretion of a low - mass protostar in a region exposed to the wind of ob stars can be terminated earlier because of the photo - evaporation of the circumstellar matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , many low - mass protostars may not complete their accretion and hence can result as brown dwarfs ( bds ) .",
    "this mechanism might affect the low - mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "recent studies have provided some information about the shape of the imf in the very low - mass and sub - stellar regimes . while the imf in the orion nebula cluster appears to rise below 0.1 m@xmath8 @xcite , in t  association like taurus - auriga and chaii",
    "there is some indication of a deficit of sub - stellar objects @xcite .",
    "other studies of the young cluster ic348 , which is devoid of very massive stars , have also revealed a deficit of bds relative to the orion nebula cluster @xcite .    because of its vicinity to the orion ob associations the l1615/l1616 cometary cloud constitutes an ideal laboratory to investigate the triggered star formation scenario .",
    "the most recent census of the pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars in l1616 was provided by @xcite , who presented a multi - wavelength study of the region , from x - ray to near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "they found 22 new low - mass pms stars distributed mainly to the east of l1616 , in about 1  square degree field . by adding the 22  new pms stars to the previously confirmed members of the cloud @xcite and counting the millimeter radio - source , i.e. the class-0 protostar mms1a found by @xcite",
    ", @xcite ended up with a sample of 33  young stellar objects associated with l1616 .",
    "however , the latter work could not investigate important aspects of the star formation in this cloud , like the imf and the impact of environmental conditions on the mass spectrum , because their sample was rather incomplete .    therefore , the aim of the present study is to perform a comprehensive census and characterisation of the pms population in l1615/l1616 , in order to investigate the star formation history , the relevance of the triggered scenario , and to study the imf . to this aim , we report both optical and near - infrared observations , as well as multi - object optical spectroscopy in l1615/l1616 .",
    "an important goal of our study is to compare the mass function in l1615/l1616 with that of other t and ob  associations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we describe our observations and data reduction in section  [ sec : photobs ] and [ sec : spec - obs ] ; the results are reported in section  [ sec : pms - ident ] , while the data analysis and the physical proprieties of the new pms stars are presented in section  [ sec : data analysis ] .",

    "the weather conditions were photometric with seeing varying between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the larger sky - area covered with vimos allowed us to extend the spectroscopic survey in a wider region around the ngc1788 reflection nebula between the four vimos quadrants prevented us from performing a uniform coverage . ] .",
    "furthermore , we carried out both intermediate- ( @xmath25/@xmath26=@xmath32 ) and low - resolution ( @xmath25/@xmath26=@xmath33 ) spectroscopy , in order to detect the lii @xmath256708   absorption line and measure its equivalent width , as well as to obtain a wider wavelength range for spectral type classification purpose ( see section  [ sec : spec - type - class ] ) .    a total of 3 intermediate- and 6 low - resolution mask configurations , each including an average number of about 100 targets , were observed .",
    "to efficiently pursue our programme and maximise the number of observed fields , only one exposure of 900 sec and one of 2000 sec were obtained for each low- and intermediate - resolution mask configuration , respectively . the typical s / n ratio at @xmath29  mag was about 80 and 180 for the intermediate- and low - resolution spectra , respectively .",
    "five spectrophotometric standard stars from @xcite and @xcite were observed to perform the absolute flux calibrations .",
    "bias and flat field frames as well as wavelength calibration exposures were acquired during daytime , following the service mode vimos calibration plan .",
    "the vimos spectra were automatically reduced by using the eso pipeline , full details of which are given by @xcite . in order to check the reliability of the data reduction ,",

    "the flames - giraffe observations were performed in visitor mode ( eso program no .",

    "the low - resolution grating lr06 was used in conjunction with an order separating filter and a slit width of @xmath35 .",
    "the adopted configuration yielded a spectral coverage of about 750   ( 64387184   ) with a mean resolving power @xmath25/@xmath26=@xmath36 .",
    "since these observations are part of a separate study on radial velocities in l1615/l1616 , these data will be described in more detail in a future paper .",
    "here we have used the flames spectra of only three objects , namely tts050644.4@xmath37032913 , rxj0507.3@xmath370326 , and tts050741.0@xmath37032253 ( see table  [ tab : list - pms ] ) , for which both fors2 and vimos observations are missing .",
    "since lithium is rapidly destroyed in the convective layers of low - mass stars in the early phases of their stellar evolution @xcite , the presence of strong lii @xmath256708   absorption line has been considered as the primary criterion for definitely assessing the pms nature of the observed stars .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission has been used as further indicator of youth , though its presence alone does not guarantee the pms nature of the observed object .",
    "therefore , all the k and m stars with h@xmath2 in emission but lacking the lii absorption line have been rejected and classified as older dke and dme field stars projected onto l1615/l1616 .",
    "in addition to the above criteria , the presence of forbidden emission lines , as well as non - photospheric uv and infrared continuum excesses ( as evidence of bipolar jets , accretion columns , and circumstellar disk , respectively ) have yielded further arguments on the pms nature of the young stars identified in l1615/l1616 .",
    "based on these criteria , we have identified 25 new pms stars with spectral type later than about k1 . by adding these sources to the previously reported pms objects @xcite , the number of optically detected young stars known so far in l1615/l1616 rises to 56 objects .",
    "the full sample is listed in table  [ tab : list - pms ] ; coordinates are those from the 2micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",

    "all the pms stars revealed by our spectroscopic follow - up , but not detected in previous x - ray and h@xmath2 surveys , have been designated with `` tts '' followed by their position , according to the iau convention . by adding the millimeter class-0 protostar discovered by @xcite , which is not reported in table  [ tab : list - pms ] , the young population of l1615/l1616 increases to 57 .",
    "thus , our spectroscopic survey almost has doubled the number of confirmed pms objects associated to l1615/l1616 . some examples of fors2 and vimos spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] . in total ,",
    "4 out of the 8 x - ray emitting sources listed by @xcite , namely rxj0506.8@xmath370305 , rxj0507.4@xmath370317 , rxj0507.6@xmath370318 , and rxj0507.3@xmath370326 , have been spectroscopically confirmed as pms stars ; the other x - ray sources ( rxj0506.5@xmath370320 , + rxj0506.4@xmath370323 , rxj0506.4@xmath370328w , and rxj0506.4@xmath370328e ) turned out to be field active stars .",
    "note that lithium has been detected for the first time in the spectrum of the mid - infrared source l1616mir4 @xcite .",
    "the s / n ratio of the spectra of the faint sources tts050654.5@xmath37032046 and + tts050730.9@xmath37031846 turned out to be insufficient for a reliable measurement of their lii equivalent width .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a broad and strong h@xmath2 emission in both spectra ( table  [ tab : spt - w ] ) can not be explained by chromospheric activity only and is typical of classical t tauri stars .",
    "indeed , according to the definition by @xcite , the upper limit on the h@xmath2 equivalent width for chromospheric activity , in the spectral range m3m5.5 , is @xmath39   . tts050654.5@xmath37032046 and tts050730.9@xmath37031846 have spectral type m4 and m5.5 and equivalent width @xmath40     and @xmath41   , respectively ; thus , they are clearly accretors .",
    "the star kisoa-0974  17 was first classified as a h@xmath2 emission - line object by @xcite .",
    "although @xcite did not obtain any spectrum of this source , they included it in their list of pms stars .",
    "we observed this object during the flames spectroscopic run .",
    "neither h@xmath2 emission nor lii absorption line were observed in its spectrum .",
    "this could be due to a mismatch between the h@xmath2 emission source and the optical counterpart detected by @xcite .",
    "thus we excluded this object from our list of pms stars .",
    "the optical ( @xmath0 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath1 ) magnitudes of the 56 optically confirmed pms stars in l1615/l1616 is presented in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "some of the objects lack wfi , oac , and/or sofi photometry because they fall outside the sky - area covered by our survey , are saturated in our images or are too faint to be observed with the 91 cm telescope at the oac observatory . nevertheless , for these stars we retrieved @xmath12 magnitudes from the tass mark iv photometric survey @xcite , @xmath42 magnitudes from the deep near - infrared survey ( denis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath1 photometry from the 2mass point source catalogue . both the sofi and denis nir magnitudes",
    "were homogenised to the 2mass photometric system using the transformation equations provided by @xcite .",
    "for a few sources , we used the optical photometry from the literature @xcite as explained in the footnotes of table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "h@xmath43 and lii @xmath256708   line equivalent widths , w(h@xmath2 ) and w(li ) , respectively , were determined by direct integration of the line profiles , as described in @xcite and @xcite , adopting the convention that a negative equivalent width means an emission line .",
    "the main source of error on these measurements comes from the uncertainty in the placement of the photospheric continuum , especially for stars later than m1 , whose spectra are strongly affected by molecular absorption bands .",
    "w(h@xmath2 ) and w(li ) for the l1615/l1616 members are reported in the third and fourth columns of table  [ tab : spt - w ] , respectively .    according to the intensity of the h@xmath2 emission line and the definitions by @xcite",
    ", we assigned the classical ( ctts ) or weak ( wtts ) t tauri star classification to the pms objects in l1615/l1616 ( table  [ tab : spt - w ] ) .",
    "the additional emission lines observed in the spectra , including the lines of hei @xmath255876 , @xmath256678.7 and @xmath257065.2   , and nai @xmath255889.9 and @xmath255895.9   , as well as the forbidden lines of [ nii ] @xmath256583.5   , [ oi ] @xmath256300.3 and @xmath256363.8   , and [ sii ] @xmath256716.4 and @xmath256730.8   , are also reported in table  [ tab : spt - w ] .",
    "note that almost only those pms stars classified as cttss show forbidden emission lines in their spectra .",
    "spectral types were determined using a modified version of rotfit , a code for spectral type and @xmath44 determination developed by @xcite under the idl environment .",
    "the general idea of the method , already adopted in @xcite and @xcite , is to recover the spectral type of a star by comparing its spectrum with a suitable grid of templates , taking into account the amount of extinction along the line of sight . since our spectra",
    "are flux calibrated , the method allowed us to get a rough estimate of the extinction ( @xmath45 ) along the line of sight to the star .",
    "to this aim , a library of relative flux calibrated and extinction - corrected templates , with a wavelength coverage encompassing that of the observed spectra , is needed . a suitable grid of intermediate - resolution ( @xmath46 )",
    "templates has been obtained by collecting spectra of dwarf and giant stars from the libraries provided by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in performing the spectral type classification",
    ", we first took into account the pms nature of the stars we were dealing with . due to the presence of tio and vo absorption bands which are strongly sensitive to the surface gravity @xcite ,",
    "most of m - type pms objects show optical spectroscopic features that can be closely reproduced averaging dwarf and giant spectra with the same spectral type @xcite . though the spectra of g - type and k - type pms stars have been usually compared with template of normal dwarf stars in several works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found that also the late k - type objects in our sample are best represented by using an average of dwarf and giant templates of the same spectral type .",
    "indeed tio and vo absorption molecular bands are still present in late k - type stars , although they are very weak .",
    "thus , both late - type dwarf and giant templates were included in our grid of reference spectra ; moreover , for spectral types later or equal than k5 , we also built up an _ ad hoc _ grid of templates by averaging dwarf and giant spectra of the same spectral sub - class",
    ". furthermore , starting from spectral types later than k7 , we constructed templates for the half sub - classes ( e.g. k8.5 , m0.5 , m1.5 , etc . ) by averaging the two contiguous spectra .",
    "indeed , the intensity of the absorption molecular bands characterising late - type stars displays a rather strong variation from one spectral sub - class to the other , allowing to appreciate differences of half a sub - class .",
    "some details on the spectra fitting procedure is provided in appendix  [ app - a ] .",
    "the spectral types of the pms objects in our sample are reported in the second column of table  [ tab : spt - w ] . from an inspection of the residuals of the fitting procedure",
    "we have estimated an accuracy of about @xmath47 sub - class for stars earlier than k7 and about @xmath48 sub - class for cooler objects . a typical uncertainty on @xmath45 of @xmath49  mag was found .",
    "for all the objects observed at least twice , with different spectrographs and/or resolving powers , we obtained consistent results , regardless of spectral resolution and wavelength coverage .",
    "for the sake of homogeneity , we re - determined the spectral types also for the previously known low - mass members , by using the spectra from @xcite . a general agreement within one /",
    "two spectral sub - classes was found between our classification and the one reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "for the two early - type stars hd293815 and kisoa-0974  15 , we have adopted the spectral types from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "both stars were spectroscopically observed by us , but many photospheric features suitable for an accurate early - type classification were not covered in our spectra .",
    "nevertheless , we attempted a spectral type estimate for both stars by applying the @xcite s criteria .",
    "the main features we used are the hei @xmath255876 and @xmath257065.2   absorption lines .",
    "the results are consistent with those reported by @xcite and @xcite . in line with our spectral type classification , the effective temperature ( @xmath50 ) of each pms star",
    "was assigned on the basis of the following criteria : the dwarf temperature scale from the compilation of @xcite was adopted for all the objects with spectral type earlier or equal to k4 ; for later spectral types an intermediate temperature scale was derived by averaging the giant compilation provided by @xcite with the dwarf one from @xcite for k0-m0 and from @xcite for m1-m7 spectral types , respectively .",
    "the @xmath50 values corresponding to the half spectral sub - classes were computed by linear interpolation .",
    "the effective temperatures assigned to each pms object are reported in the second column of table  [ tab : param ] . in assessing the errors on @xmath50 the uncertainty on the spectral type classification",
    "was taken into account .",
    "the method we used for computing extinction , stellar radii , and luminosities follows the general guidelines described in @xcite , although we modified their scheme to match our purposes .",
    "the eight broad - band magnitudes available for the l1615/l1616 pms population allowed us to construct the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each pms star covering a wide spectral range , from optical to near - infrared wavelengths ( see table  [ tab : abs - flux - calib ] ) . by using simultaneously all the photospheric colours encompassed by the sed , we computed for each object both the interstellar extinction ( @xmath45 ) and the ratio of total - to - selective extinction ( @xmath51 ) , as well as the stellar radius ( @xmath52 ) and luminosity ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "apart for eventual ultraviolet and infrared excesses caused by the presence of an interacting accretion disk around the pms star and by the related boundary layer , or hot accretion spots , the shape of the observed sed is mostly determined by the effective temperature of the object , the amount of dust along the line of sight , and the dust - grain mean size in the interstellar / cicumstellar environment .",
    "therefore , once the effective temperature is known , both the value of @xmath45 and @xmath54 may be recovered simultaneously by fitting the observed sed with a grid of theoretical ones . indeed , both the star radius and distance cause just a rigid shift of the flux on a logarithmic scale , without affecting the shape of the sed .",
    "theoretical seds may be obtained by using stellar atmosphere models with the same effective temperature as the star and reddened by various amount of @xmath45 and @xmath54 .",
    "a detailed description of the sed fitting procedure is reported in appendix  [ app - b ] . here",
    "we want to stress that , our two - parameter fitting procedure can be applied only to the objects which are significantly affected by extinction , i.e to the stars which are still deeply embedded in their parent cloud .",
    "indeed , for slightly reddened stars the value of @xmath45 is relatively insensitive to changes in the slope of the reddening law ( @xmath54 ) , as shown in appendix  [ app - b ] .",
    "therefore , for all the objects for which @xmath45 turned out to be less than about 0.5 mag we reiterated the fitting procedure fixing @xmath54 to the standard value of 3.1 .",
    "the same assumption was adopted for all the objects lacking optical photometry and for the veiled star tts050649.8@xmath37032104 .",
    "the values of @xmath45 , @xmath54 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are listed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "for all the objects spectroscopically observed in this work , we found that the value of @xmath45 derived from the sed fitting procedure is in agreement , within @xmath55  mag , with the one obtained from the spectral type classification .",
    "@xmath54 was derived for 15 out of the 56 pms stars in l1615/l1616 ( table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "we found a weighted mean value of @xmath56 , closely matching the standard one of 3.1 , typical of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "for the herbig star kisoa-0974  15 we obtained a value of @xmath57 ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "this may be related to the presence of dust grains around the intermediate - mass star which are larger in size than those characteristic of the interstellar medium , as already found by different authors in large samples of haebe stars @xcite .",
    "the mass and age of each member of l1615/l1616 have been derived by comparing the location of the object on the h - r diagram with the theoretical pms evolutionary tracks by @xcite & @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( figure  [ hr ] ) .    since stellar evolutionary models",
    "are still rather uncertain , particularly in the low - mass star and sub - stellar regimes ( @xmath58 , * ? ? ?",

    "once the physical parameters of the pms objects are known , we can study the star formation in l1615/l1616 . in the next sub - sections we discuss the history , rate and efficiency of star formation , and some issues related to the mass - spectrum .      based on the most complete census of the l1615/l1616 s population performed in this work , we further investigated the triggered star formation scenario suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in left panel of figure  [ fig :",

    "such rim is located to the east of ngc1788 , at @xmath65 from the head of the cometary cloud ( about 0.85 pc at a distance of 450 pc ) and it is directly exposed to the uv radiation from the orion ob stars . on the other hand , the wttss are more scattered ( only @xmath66% is projected on ngc1788 ) and mainly occupy the side of the cloud facing the ob1 associations and to the east of the bright rim .    by applying the kolmogorov - smirnov test to the wtts and",
    "ctts age distributions we found that the two populations are similar at a confidence level of @xmath67  % .",
    "thus , it seems there are no age differences between cttss and wttss in our pms sample .",
    "this result is consistent with previous pms populations studies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) ; cttss are predicted to have ages between about 0.5 and 3 myr , although some stars retain ctts characteristics even at ages as old as 20  myr . on the other hand , many wttss occupy the same region on the h - r diagram as cttss do , whereas some of them are approaching the zero - age main sequence .    the age distribution of the l1615/l1616 population peaks between 1 and 3 myr , depending on the adopted evolutionary tracks ( figure  [ fig : hist_ages_masses ] , right panels ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings by @xcite , but the age spread found by us is significantly higher than what these authors claim , exceeding the value expected on the basis of the uncertainties on luminosity and temperature .",
    "the l1615/l1616 members span a wide range in age , from less than 0.1  myr up to about 30  myr .",
    "this might suggest multiple events of star formation in the cloud , which would further support the hypothesis of triggered star formation .    in order to investigate a possible age difference between `` on - cloud '' and `` off - cloud '' pms objects , we divided the sample in two groups , fixing as dividing line the bright rim of the cloud .",
    "twenty of 56 objects in our sample are located within the boundaries of ngc1788 , i.e. to the west of the bright rim , while 36 are off - cloud members .",
    "the age distributions of the two groups are shown in figure  [ compare_age ] . the on - cloud pms stars are statistically younger than those located to the east of the bright rim , regardless of the adopted evolutionary tracks . applying a kolmogorov - smirnov test we found that the probability that the two sets are sub - sample of the same statistical population is very low ; in particular , we found confidence levels of 1.29 , 0.18 , and 0.19% when using the pms evolutionary tracks by @xcite & @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we thus concluded that there is a clear age difference between the two groups of stars .",
    "the above findings further support the scenario of triggered star formation in l1615/l1616 , as proposed by @xcite . in this context , the spatial dispersion and older age of the `` off - cloud ''",
    "members can be explained as a consequence of the `` rocket acceleration '' effect . as recently pointed out by @xcite",
    ", this acceleration continues after the onset of star formation and the parental cloud is further accelerated with respect to the newly formed objects . as a consequence ,",
    "the cloud is soon swept off the newly formed stars .",
    "this hypothesis , together with the rapid dispersion typical of small clouds , causes the spatial displacement of the oldest cloud members .",

    "* ) might be a consequence of this mechanism as well .      based on @xmath68co and @xmath69co column density maps",

    "@xcite mapped both l1615 and l1616 in the co j=1 - 0 transition line .",
    "they inferred that the mass of the cloud system as a whole is @xmath72  @xmath71 , @xmath73  @xmath71 and @xmath74 based on @xmath68co , @xmath69co and @xmath75co observations respectively .",
    "they also derived the mass of the @xmath69co and @xmath75co cores ( i.e. l1616 only ) finding a value of @xmath76  @xmath71 and @xmath77  @xmath71 , in good agreement with the @xcite s determination .",

    "the sfe reported by @xcite for l1616 is based on the cloud mass reported by @xcite and the total stellar mass of the 32 members of the cloud investigated by the authors ( i.e. @xmath80 ) .",
    "since the star formation history of l1615 and l1616 is intimately connected , we have re - calculated the sfe considering the system l1615 plus l1616 as a whole . by using the nicer color excess method by @xcite",
    ", we mapped the dust extinction of the cloud complex and derived its mass . in the nicer technique the @xmath81 and @xmath82 colours of the field stars",
    "are compared to the colours of stars in a nearby reference field .",
    "the colour - excesses of the field stars are then combined and transformed to the visual extinction @xmath45 , fixing the form of the reddening curve .",
    "the normal interstellar extinction law derived by @xcite has been adopted by us for this purpose .",
    "we retrieved the 2mass colours of all the point - like sources located in a @xmath83 region centered on ngc1788 and in a reference field close to the l1615/l1616 cloud .",
    "the latter field was selected by using the nearby low - intensity regions of the iras  100@xmath62 m dust emission map , according to prescription by @xcite .",
    "finally , the visual extinction map resulting from the nicer method was converted to cloud mass by assuming the standard gas - to - dust ratio @xcite .",
    "we found a value of @xmath84  @xmath5 , in good agreement with the one inferred by @xcite on the basis of @xmath68co observations .",
    "based on this value and on the total mass of the 56 present - day known members of the complex ( i.e. 4146  @xmath5 , depending on the adopted evolutionary tracks ) , we derived a sfe in l1615/l1616 of 78% , i.e. significantly lower than the previous estimate by @xcite , but still in good agreement with the one generally found in giant molecular clouds hosting ob associations ( 510% ) and predicted by theoretical calculations on the formation of ob associations ( see * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether l1615/l1615 can be considered as a cluster .",
    "according to the definition suggested by @xcite , a cluster is a group of some 35 members with a total mass density larger than 1.0  m@xmath8pc@xmath85 . to estimate the density of pms objects in l1615/l1615 , we considered the region spectroscopically surveyed by us ( figure  [ fig : specsurvey ] ) .",
    "this region covers an area of approximately 0.25 square degrees and includes about 40 pms objects . assuming a distance of 450  pc , the resulting area is about 4  pc@xmath86 , which means a surface density of about 10 - 11 pms objects per pc@xmath86 and a volume density on the order of 7 pms objects per pc@xmath87 . in the latter calculation we estimated the volume as @xmath88",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming a locally spherical distribution of sources .",
    "the average mass of the 40 pms objects , as determined from the results in section  [ sec : masses - ages ] , is on the order of 0.7  m@xmath8 , which implies a volume density of about 4 - 5  m@xmath8pc@xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the group of 40 pms objects confined in the spectroscopically surveyed area can be considered as a cluster according to the criterion by @xcite .",
    "now , it is interesting to estimate the rate at which the stars in this small cluster are formed . according to the results of section  [ sec : masses - ages ] , we estimated that the total mass in pms objects in that region is on the order of 4146  m@xmath89 .",
    "therefore , considering the average age of 2  myr for these objects ( see figure  [ fig : hist_ages_masses ] ) , we found that the cometary cloud is turning some 20 - 23  @xmath5 into pms objects every myr , which is lower than the star formation rate in other clusters like those in serpens @xcite , but higher than in other t  associations like chamaeleon  ii @xcite and lupus @xcite .",
    "thus we concluded that l1615/l1616 is a small cluster with a moderate star formation rate .      though based on a low - number statistics , the first clue on the initial mass function in l1615/l1616",
    "was given by @xcite .",
    "based on this study , the imf in this region appears roughly consistent with that of the solar neighbourhood in the mass range @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the authors also found several candidates for young bds and estimated the expected number of bds relative to more massive pms stars in l1615/l1616 to be intermediate between taurus ( @xmath91% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the trapezium cluster ( @xmath92% , * ? ? ?",
    "the depth of the spectroscopic survey conducted in this work goes down to @xmath93  mag ( i.e. @xmath94 , see section  [ sec : bd - fraction ] ) , leading to the discovery of young objects with a mass close to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "we have thus attempted a fair imf determination down to the low - mass stellar regime ( i.e. @xmath95 ) .",
    "all the present - day known members of l1615/l1616 have masses in the range between @xmath30.1 and 5.5  @xmath5 ; their mean mass varies between 0.6 and 0.8  @xmath5 depending on the adopted evolutionary tracks ( see table  [ tab : mass_age ] and fig  [ fig : hist_ages_masses ] , left panels ) .",
    "however , although our survey recovers most of the previously known young objects in l1615/l1616 , the completeness of our pms sample is different from the one of @xcite sample .",
    "the latter includes bright and solar - like objects located in areas not covered by the deeper wfi survey .",
    "therefore , we restriced our imf analysis to the sample of objects that lie on the sky - area covered with wfi ( figure  [ fig : iras - image ] , right panel ) .    the shape of the imf in the cloud",
    "may then be constrained using the usual approximation for the low - mass function ( @xmath96 ) , as reported by @xcite .",
    "we divided the mass range into mass bins of about @xmath97 ; this value is larger than the accuracy on mass estimates as derived from the uncertainties on temperatures and luminosities and , at the same time , allows us to have a statistically significant number of objects in each bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : imf ] shows the imf in l1615/l1616 as obtained by using the three sets of evolutionary tracks by @xcite & @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath2 in the three cases agree within the errors and we can derive a weighted mean value of : @xmath98 as the best approximation of the imf slope in l1615/l1616 in the mass range @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "we notice , however , that the evolutionary models by @xcite tend to produce a steeper imf with respect to those by @xcite & @xcite and @xcite , as already found by @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : imf ] the @xmath2 slope obtained for the imf in l1615/l1616 is compared with those obtained in other star forming regions with different ages and environmental conditions .",
    "these values indicate a common shape of imf in the mass range from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "this provides further evidence of a universal imf also in the low - mass regime and is in agreement with the results already established for the intermediate and massive star domains @xcite .",
    "prior to our survey , no confirmed bds in l1615/l1616 were reported in the literature .",
    "however , @xcite photometrically selected some 3040 candidates for bds in this region and estimated a fraction of sub - stellar objects relative to pms stars ( @xmath101 ) in the range from 18% to 25% , i.e. similar to the value measured in the trapezium cluster @xcite and in other ob associations .",
    "our spectroscopic observations , which investigated about 50% of the bd candidates with @xmath102 mag reported by @xcite , revealed 34 young objects with mass @xmath103 ( see table  [ tab : mass_age ] ) , close to the hydrogen burning limit , and no objects with lower mass .",
    "however , taking into account the accuracy with which we estimated the masses , these objects could be bds with a mass just below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the @xmath101 in the cloud would be then around 57% .",
    "though the very low - mass bds ( @xmath104 ) and some deeply embedded low - mass objects might have escaped detection in our survey , this value should be slightly lower than the one estimated for other t  associations ( 1215% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the photometric survey conducted by us in l1615/l1616 is spatially and photometrically complete down to @xmath105  mag at @xmath106 level .",
    "however , only objects brighter than @xmath93 mag could be observed spectroscopically with a s / n ratio sufficient for spectral type classification purpose . a 13  myr old object",
    "( i.e. the typical age of the l1615/l1616 population ) at the distance of 450  pc ( i.e. a distance modulus of 8.27  mag ) with a mass @xmath107 would have @xmath108  mag in the absence of extinction @xcite .",
    "thus , in the off - cloud regions of l1615/l1616 , where @xmath109  mag , our survey is sensitive down to @xmath110 .",
    "the visual extinction occurring in the dense head of the cloud varies in the range 15  mag which displaces the limiting mass of the objects with @xmath108  mag to 0.050.50  @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that we are probably missing the very low - mass objects only in the small dense core of the cloud .",
    "given the peculiar star formation history in this cloud ( section  [ sec : star - form - hist ] ) , the knowledge of its sub - stellar mass spectrum could give crucial insights into the process forming bds under particular environmental conditions .    .",
    "[ fig : isoc_bes ]    the bd candidates sample by @xcite was selected by inspection of @xmath12 versus @xmath22 colour - magnitude diagram in comparison with the theoretical isochrones by @xcite & @xcite .",
    "this approach to search for pms star and young bd candidates is the most direct way to tackle the problem using optical photometric data ; however , in order to select cluster members on the basis of their magnitudes and colours , isochrones that adequately model the data must be used , since the shape of the isochrones may vary significantly from one photometric system to another .",
    "the theoretical isochrones for low - mass stars and bds are provided by @xcite & @xcite in the cousins photometric system @xcite , while the observations by @xcite were performed by using the wfi camera at the eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "the wfi filters transmission curves are somewhat different from the original cousins ones , in particular for the @xmath111-band . @xcite",

    "[ fig : isoc_bes ] these isochrones are compared with those by @xcite & @xcite .",
    "the two sets of isochrones appear significantly different , in particular for the coolest objects , i.e. @xmath112 , where the use of the isochrones in the cousins system would produced many spurious member candidates .",
    "this consideration , together with the contamination by background / foreground stars in the field taken into account by the authors , could explain why @xcite overestimated the number of bd candidates .",
    "the use of the adequate isochrones for the wfi - cousins system would produce much less bd candidates , in agreement with the number of pms objects with mass close to the hydrogen burning limit confirmed by our spectroscopic follow - up ( see table  [ tab : mass_age ] ) .",
    "though the @xmath101 estimated by us for l1615/l1616 needs further refinements , the region seems to be poor of bds , with a @xmath101 ratio close to that observed in t  associations or , perhaps , even lower .",
    "though in l1615/l1616 the radiation from the massive stars in the orion ob1 associations is likely responsible for the star formation ( section  [ sec : star - form - hist ] ) , this primordial process does not seems to favour the formation of bds .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the radial velocity ( rv ) distribution of the stars in l1615/l1616 shows a well defined peak at @xmath113  km / s with the standard deviation of @xmath114  km / s which is consistent with the average rv error ( i.e. @xmath115  km / s ) .",
    "this may indicate that the velocity dispersion of the stars must be less than @xmath116  km / s . considering a velocity dispersion of a few km / s , @xmath117",
    "myr old objects would disperse over a distance of about @xmath117  pc , which is the approximate projected size of the head of the cometary cloud and has been completely covered by our photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "thus , the results of our study in l1615/l1616 does not play in favour of dynamical ejection or photoevaporation by ionising radiation from massive stars being triggering factors of the bds formation mechanism .",
    "we have undertaken a study of the star formation process in the l1615/l1616 cometary cloud , a small star forming region located in the outskirt of the orion ob associations .",

    "we have computed stellar luminosities by means of a sed fitting procedure properly developed by us , which also evaluates the interstellar / circumstellar reddening .",

    "the o@xmath120 absorption telluric bands near @xmath36900 and @xmath37600   , as well as the h@xmath120o one near  @xmath37250   are marked .",

    "the method we employed to determine both the reddening parameters ( i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath54 ) and the stellar intrinsic properties ( i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) of each pms star , is based on the use of appropriate stellar atmosphere models .",
    "taking into account the effective temperature range of the l1615/l1616 members ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) , as well as the wide wavelength coverage required to encompass their seds ( see table  [ tab : abs - flux - calib ] ) , we merged three distinct sets of low - resolution synthetic spectra , adopting the following criteria :    * for the two intermediate - mass stars , namely the b9v - type hd293815 and the herbig b3e - type star kisoa-0974  15 , we chose the grid of stellar atmosphere models computed by @xcite ; * for sources covering the effective temperature interval between 4000 and 10000 k we used the low - resolution synthetic spectra calculated by @xcite with their _ nextgen _ model - atmosphere code ; * for objects cooler than 4000  k we used the synthetic low - resolution _ stardusty _ spectra for low - mass stars and bds by @xcite .",
    "the _ stardusty _",
    "spectra , which take into account dust grain formation in the model atmosphere due to an efficient gravitational settling process , are the most suitable for simulating cool objects , down to the very low - mass end .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that silicate dust grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of the latest m dwarfs and bds .",
    "each set of atmosphere models contains flux density spectra at the stellar surface , computed for different value of gravity and metallicity .",
    "we kept the gravity of the atmosphere models to a fixed value of @xmath126 ( cgs units ) , which is appropriate for low - mass stars and bds younger than @xmath127  myr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this value closely matches the one expected for haebe and early type main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "we also adopted a solar metallicity .",
    "however , we remind the reader that @xcite have analysed the influence of gravity and metallicity on the fitting - procedure and found that neither of them affects the values of the derived parameters significantly .",
    "a grid of models matching the adopted effective temperature scale ( see section  [ sec : spec - type - class ] ) was first derived by performing a linear interpolation of the merged set of synthetic spectra . in order to compare the observed seds with theoretical ones ,",
    "synthetic magnitudes in the same photometric systems in which the observations were performed are required .",
    "thus , for each adopted temperature we derived a look - up table of synthetic @xmath128 absolute magnitudes by reddening the corresponding theoretical spectrum with an increasing value of @xmath45 ( from 0 to 15 mag with a step of 0.05 mag ) and @xmath54 ( from 1 to 9 with a step of 0.1 ) , and subsequently integrating the reddened spectrum over each photometric pass - band .",
    "the extinction law by @xcite was adopted to perform this reddening procedure .",
    "since the model spectra are given as flux density at the star s surface , the synthetic magnitudes were computed for a star with one solar radius , as seen from a distance of @xmath127  pc .",
    "the johnson - cousins @xmath0 and 2mass @xmath1 transmission curves from _ the asiago database on photometric systems _",
    "@xcite , as well as the absolute flux calibration constants reported in table  [ tab : abs - flux - calib ] were used to integrate each progressively reddened theoretical spectra .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath45 and @xmath54 of each pms star ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) were derived simultaneously by fitting the corresponding observed sed to the look - up table of reddened synthetic magnitudes having the same effective temperature as the given object . in order to eliminate the magnitude shift introduced by the unknown star s radius and distance ,",
    "the observed and the synthetic magnitudes were previously normalised to the @xmath12-band . for pms stars showing clear evidence of near - infrared excess associated with the presence of circumstellar material",
    ", the fit was performed to the short - wavelength portion ( @xmath129 ) of the sed , which is less contaminated by near - infrared excess .",
    "the error on @xmath45 and @xmath54 has been evaluated taking into account both the accuracy on the spectral type classification ( section  [ sec : spec - type - class ] ) and the photometric errors on the observed magnitudes .",
    "an example of the output of the fitting procedure is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : countourplot ] , where a countour plot of the @xmath130 value in the @xmath54-@xmath45 plane is reported . as already stated in section  [ sec : intext - rad - lum ] , our two - parameter fitting procedure can be applied only to stars which suffer a visual extinction larger than about 0.5  mag . for low - reddened stars",
    "the value of @xmath45 is fairly independent of changes in @xmath54 .",
    "as clearly evident in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : countourplot ] , in this case a unique solution could not be found simultaneously in the @xmath54-@xmath45 plane .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath131 , typical of the diffuse interstellar medium , was assumed for all the object with @xmath132  mag .",
    "once the extinction parameters were determined , the value of @xmath52 for each pms object was obtained from the magnitude shifts required to match the observed magnitudes to the theoretical ones , reddened with the best - fitting @xmath45 and @xmath54 .",
    "only the photometric bands actually used in the fitting procedure for each given object were employed to determine its stellar radius .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , we made the assumption that all the members of l1615/l1616 are located at @xmath133 pc .",
    "finally the value of @xmath53 was derived assuming a black body emission at the star s effective temperature and radius .",
    "the associated uncertainties were derived taking into account the errors on the distance and effective temperature .",

    "<S> the present work aims at performing a comprehensive census and characterisation of the pre - main sequence ( pms ) population in the cometary cloud l1615/l1616 , in order to assess the significance of the triggered star formation scenario and investigate the impact of massive stars on its star formation history and mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry , as well as optical multi - object spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a physical parametrisation of the young stellar population in l1615/l1616 . </S>",
    "<S> we identified 25 new t  tauri stars mainly projected on the dense head of the cometary cloud , almost doubling the current number of known members . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the spatial distribution of the cloud members as a function of the age and h@xmath2 emission . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation efficiency in the cloud is @xmath3  78% , as expected for molecular clouds in the vicinity of ob associations . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) , in the mass range @xmath4  @xmath5 , is consistent with that of other t and ob associations , providing further support of an universal imf down to the hydrogen burning limit , regardless of environmental conditions . the cometary appearance , as well as the high star formation efficiency , </S>",
    "<S> can be explained in terms of triggered star formation induced by the strong uv radiation from ob stars or supernovae shockwaves . </S>",
    "<S> the age spread as well as both the spatial and age distribution of the pms objects provide strong evidence of sequential , multiple events and possibly still ongoing star formation activity in the cloud . </S>"
