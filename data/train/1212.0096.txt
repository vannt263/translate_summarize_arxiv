    "the efforts of implementing predictive controllers in electrical drives aim at replacing the classical cascaded field - oriented control structure with pi controllers .",
    "the machine can be better exploited by improved control behavior , the system variables are optimized . in this contribution , the conventional torque and current control structure of two separate controllers is changed to multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) control . by transformation into the field - oriented frame ,",
    "torque generation is decoupled from flux variation , however , the current controllers are still strongly coupled , therefore a mimo controller is advantageous .",
    "the obtained improvements are better decoupling , better current and voltage constraint handling by exploiting cross - coupling between the orthogonal components , and better power efficiency and dynamics by optimally adjusting the currents in both dynamic and steady - state operation .",
    "the major obstacle in implementing predictive control schemes is the limited computational power , inherited by the high sampling rates .",
    "existing implementations suffer from this restriction and can not exploit the full advantages of model predictive control ( mpc ) .",
    "for instance , generalized predictive control ( gpc ) has a high optimization horizon but is unconstrained , whereas predictive torque control ( ptc ) is constrained but so far only reaches @xmath0 steps of prediction @xcite . for good performance , both , inclusion of constraints and a high optimization horizon are required . using control in the field - oriented frame",
    ", the analytical problem description enables using mathematical optimization algorithms .",
    "such schemes are computationally efficient and maximize the obtained information for a given computational power .",
    "the online solution of the linearly constrained linear - quadratic problem , typical for mpc , requires quadratic programming ( qp ) algorithms , which are , however , computationally too expensive for drive systems .",
    "a recent development is the use of explicit mpc , where an offline solution is computed and stored as look - up table in the real - time controller @xcite @xcite .",
    "the scheme reaches @xmath1 prediction steps with constraints .",
    "while several fast online algorithms were recently proposed @xcite @xcite , most of them based on gradient search algorithms , the interest in online solutions is growing .",
    "advantages of online optimization are manipulation and adaptation of parameters , resulting in a more flexible choice of machines for the control system .",
    "this implementation is based on a suboptimal trajectory generation algorithm presented in @xcite , embedded in a flatness - based predictive control scheme @xcite .",
    "it is based on a continuous approach , the variables are not discretized but represented as a polynomial with undetermined coefficients . with this method",
    ", higher optimization horizons can be reached with comparably few parameters , considerably reducing the computational burden .",
    "constraints are handled by linearization of the cost functional and the use of a linear programming ( lp ) solver , which is amongst the smallest and fastest numerical optimizers .",
    "as result , a ( suboptimal ) prediction of @xmath0 ms with current and voltage constraints is obtained at @xmath2 khz sampling rate .",
    "as linear - quadratic optimization problems with linear constraints are simpler to solve in real - time , the machine model is linearized . assuming that the rotor speed does not change too much over the optimization horizon @xmath3 , @xmath4 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pmsm model and the voltage equations become linear .",
    "the electrical subsystem of the machine , consisting of the quadrature and direct currents @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( peak values ) , is given as @xmath7 the nomenclature is shown in table ii in the appendix .",
    "it is noted that the reluctance torque @xmath8 is neglected , as this term is very small compared to the electromagnetic torque in surface - mounted pmsms or in machines with small saliency .",
    "furthermore , it would render the model nonlinear , requiring nonlinear optimization methods @xcite .",
    "the formulation of a suitable cost functional is a key point in predictive control , as it is the only tuning possibility of the control scheme .",
    "the optimization is aiming at minimizing the control error for good dynamical performance as well as machine losses for better efficiency .",
    "both goals are included in the cost functional . by choosing the cost functional and weights well , it is possible to find a good trade - off between both goals during transients , or eventually to fulfill both goals in steady - state .",
    "the cost functional for the predictive torque controller is @xmath9 which trades off the squared control error @xmath10 with machine losses @xmath11 the first term in @xmath12 represents copper losses , and the second term represents the iron losses consisting of hysteresis losses .",
    "eddy current losses are negligible on the tested machines , however , they could be included using the model presented in @xcite .",
    "iron losses can be reduced by field - weakening , where a trade - off between copper and iron losses is found @xcite . imposing a negative direct current @xmath6 , the flux magnitude in the stator",
    "is reduced while the copper losses increase .",
    "as the iron loss constant @xmath13 is not part of standard motor parameters , it has to be determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "the last term in @xmath14 is the end - weight of the control error and aims at reducing the steady - state control error .",
    "the weight @xmath15 was set @xmath16 , the value was determined heuristically",
    ".    the optimization horizon is set @xmath17 ms such that the cost functional includes the complete setpoint change .",
    "it is important that the optimization horizon is high enough , otherwise the open - loop and closed - loop trajectories differ and the behavior is strongly suboptimal .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : horizon ] .",
    "if the horizon is too small , due to the end - weight of the control error , a significant difference between the optimized open - loop trajectories , and the closed - loop trajectories resulting from regeneration at every sampling step , appears .",
    "then , the closed - loop trajectories simply do nt fit the cost functional anymore . for a horizon higher than required for the setpoint change , the difference between open- and closed - loop trajectories becomes smaller .",
    ", width=491 ]      the most important nonlinearities of a pmsm , in terms of control , are the voltage and current limitations .",
    "the current constraints prevent overheating of the machine , and the voltage is limited by the maximum dc - link voltage of the inverter .",
    "the voltage constraints limit rotor speed as well as current dynamics in high - speed operation .",
    "these constraints are linearized , in order to be computationally efficiently treated .",
    "the current range for the direct current @xmath6 is limited to @xmath18 .",
    "only negative values of @xmath6 are desirable , as they improve power efficiency and reduce the induced voltage by weakening the flux magnitude in the stator @xcite @xcite .",
    "the lowest value @xmath19 is the optimum value at rated speed ( @xmath20 ) and is given as @xmath21 which is independent of quatrature current @xmath5 as the reluctance torque was neglected .",
    "the value is doubled to enable further field - weakening to improve dynamics in high speed , an effect described in the experimental results section . for the quadrature current @xmath5 ,",
    "the largest possible range of values should be available .",
    "the resulting linear constraints , shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] , almost completely fill the current region of interest .",
    "a linearization is thus acceptable .",
    "the voltage linearization is a little bit more difficult .",
    "the @xmath22-axis should not be restricted , as the induced voltage is aligned to it and is the largest value that will appear .",
    "a steady - state analysis of the system equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) shows that a rectangular voltage area results @xmath23 this rectangle is expanded such that the outer circle of the voltage limitation is hit ( light grey on fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] ) . during dynamical transients ,",
    "the voltage vector points to one of the outer corners , subsequently touching the outer limiting circle .",
    "therefore , linearizing the voltage limits as a rectangle by the presented method , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] , does not limit the operational range and only marginally affects dynamics .",
    "a less restrictive method is presented in @xcite , where a time - varying linearization in form of a hexagon in stator frame is presented .",
    "while such a linearization is possible with the underlying predictive control algorithm , the chosen method in the ( @xmath24)-frame is chosen for simplicity .",
    ", width=321 ]",
    "to study real - time applicability of the presented scheme , first , the highest possible amount of optimization parameters is determined .",
    "the fastest optimizer with constraints is the widely known linear programming ( lp ) method .",
    "table i shows some worst - case computational results of lp ( simplex method from @xcite ) as function of the number of free parameters ( cpu : @xmath25 ghz industrial pc ) .",
    "more parameters lead to a higher number of iterations which are also more complex ; the worst - case number of iterations is the number of parameters plus the number of constraints . as in the underlying application , the constraints are decoupled , however , this worst - case is not to be expected .",
    "the maximum runtime is given by the sampling rate minus latency of input / output , therefore at @xmath2 khz sampling rate , it must be less than about @xmath26 @xmath27s .",
    "thus , at best , @xmath28 parameters can be optimized .",
