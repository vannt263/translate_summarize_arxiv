    "noncommutative field theories @xcite are interesting subjects which possess the connections with planck scale physics , such as string theory and quantum gravity .",

    "such field theories are known to appear as effective field theories of open string theory with a constant background @xmath6 field @xcite .",
    "various aspects have been extensively analyzed not only as the simplest field theories in quantum spacetime but also as toy models of string theory @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the moyal spacetime is invariant under the twisted poincar transformation @xcite , which has a hopf algebraic structure ; the leibnitz rule of the symmetry algebra is deformed @xcite . to implement the twisted poincar invariance in the noncommutative field theories at quantum level",
    ", it has been found that one has to impose a nontrivial statistics on fields , which is called braiding @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can demonstrate that in general setting , for correlation functions to possess a hopf algebraic symmetry at quantum level , we have to include a braiding @xcite .",
    "since the moyal phase is canceled by the braiding @xcite , the nonplanar amplitudes , which usually violate the unitarity when the timelike noncommutativity does not vanish @xcite , trivially satisfy the cutkosky rule @xcite if we include the braiding .",

    "this noncommutative field theory is also physically interesting because the euclidean version of the theory is known to appear as the effective field theory of three dimensional quantum gravity theory ( ponzano - regge model @xcite ) which couples with spinless massive particles @xcite . since massive particles coupled with three dimensional einstein gravity",
    "are understood as conical singularities in three dimensions @xcite , this noncommutative field theory is expected to describe the dynamics of such conical singularities .",
    "we investigate the unitarity of the three dimensional noncommutative scalar field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime .",
    "this noncommutative field theory also possesses a hopf algebraic translational symmetry @xcite , since the momentum space has an @xmath1 group structure , which has been shown based on the assumptions of commutative momentum operators and lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , for the hopf algebraic translational symmetry to hold in the noncommutative field theory at quantum level , we have to introduce braiding among fields @xcite . with the braiding ,",
    "the nonplanar amplitudes become the same as the corresponding planar amplitudes if they exist .",
    "but unlike the moyal case , even the planar amplitudes are nontrivial because of the nontrivial momentum space . thus , it is a non - trivial issue whether the cutkosky rules for various planar as well as non - planar amplitudes hold in the lie - algebraic noncommutative field theory , even when the braiding is introduced .",

    "the most important axiom is that an _ action _ on a tensor product of vector space @xmath80 and @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the coproduct of the hopf algebra .",

    "the _ action _ of @xmath57 on the tensor product @xmath88 is defined with the coproduct @xmath85 by @xmath89 in the case of the product of three fields , the _ action _ of @xmath57 is given by @xmath90 similarly , the _ action _ on arbitrary products of fields is uniquely determined by the coproduct which satisfies the coassociativity ( [ eq : coassociative ] ) .    in our case , ( [ eq : g1g2i ] ) and ( [ eq : g1g2 - 1 ] ) determine the coproduct of @xmath91 and @xmath92 as @xmath93 in fact , @xmath94 thus , we find that the coproduct ( [ eq : coprop ] ) is different from the usual one , @xmath95 which leads to the usual leibnitz rule . in @xmath96 limit , ( [ eq : coprop ] )",

    "then , it becomes @xmath98 thus , the interaction term is invariant under the hopf algebraic translational symmetry . in the same way , we can show that the total action of the noncommutative field theory is invariant under the hopf algebraic translational symmetry .",

    "the amplitude of the planar diagram is given by @xmath101 for simplicity , we set @xmath102 without loss of generality .",

    "but as we described in the introduction , in order to possess a hopf algebraic symmetry in a field theory at quantum level , we have to include a nontrivial statistics , which is called braiding @xcite . in the case of the noncommutative scalar field theory in the lie - algebraic noncommutative spacetime ,",
    "the braiding is given by @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 means the exchange of two fields .",

    "considering the braiding rule , the nonplanar amplitude ( [ eq : nonplanar ] ) becomes @xmath146 since this is the same as the planar amplitude ( [ eq : planarresult ] ) , the momentum conservation is restored .",
    "it is worth mentioning that even if fields possess a nontrivial braiding , we can formulate correlation functions by using the braided path integral @xcite .",
    "the naively derived feynman rules ( [ eq : feynman rule ] ) are justified in the context of the braided quantum field theory .",
    "we check whether the cutkosky rule @xcite , which gives the unitary relation of s - matrix in conventional field theories , is satisfied in the noncommutative field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime at the one - loop self - energy diagram .",
    "the cutkosky rule is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the transition matrix element between states @xmath82 and @xmath149 , and the summation is over all the ways to cut through the diagram such that the cut propagators can simultaneously be put on shell .",
    "when we check the unitarity , we impose the on - shell conditions on the external legs , where the on - shell conditions restrict the energies to reside on the bold line in figure [ fig : identify ] . in @xmath2 theory , the cutkosky rule of the one - loop self - energy diagram is given by figure [ fig : cutkoski ] .     theory . ]",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the one - loop nonplanar self - energy diagram becomes the same contribution as the planar diagram if we include the braiding ( [ eq : braid ] ) .",

    "the imaginary part of the planar amplitude ( [ eq : planarresult ] ) is given by @xmath150 this expression has branch cuts in the following regions : @xmath151 because the arguments of the logarithm become negative .",

    "on the other hand , if @xmath155 is larger than @xmath156 , the unphysical process given by figure [ fig : event2 ] will contribute to the imaginary part of the amplitude , because the threshold value of two negative masses @xmath158 under the identification @xmath159 is in the positive energy region .",
