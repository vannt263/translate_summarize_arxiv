    "modern methods for rare events allow the search of metastable states in complex systems , such as systems in condensed phase .",
    "examples of these methods are the temperature accelerated molecular dynamics ( tamd ) @xcite , with the associated temperature accelerate monte carlo ( tamc ) @xcite and the methadynamics @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the introduction of an extended system consisting of the physical degrees of freedom ( positions and momenta of the atoms ) and a set of extra dynamical variables @xmath3 representing possible realizations of a set of suitable collective variables @xmath4 characterizing the states of the system . from now on",
    ", we will refer to the space of the @xmath5 variables as the @xmath6-space .",
    "the @xmath7 variables are coupled to the atoms by a suitable potential ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : theory - restrainedmd ] ) that forces the latter to stay in a configuration compatible with the restraint @xmath8 . from these simulations",
    "we can compute the probability density function @xmath9 to be at a given point in the @xmath6-space .",
    "@xmath9 is connected to the landau free energy by the relation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant . in these methods ,",
    "the sampling of the configuration space is accelerated by biasing the dynamics of the @xmath5 variables : the latter are forced to visit less probable regions of the @xmath6-space and , as a results , the atoms will also visit the corresponding regions in the configuration space . in tamd and tamc",
    "this biasing consists in setting the @xmath6-temperature to a value much higher than the physical temperature .",
    "this makes it possible for the system to sample regions at high free energy , @xmath12 . in metadynamics ,",
    "the biasing amounts to apply a history dependent biasing potential on the @xmath6 variables that forces the system to visit region of the @xmath6-space not visited before . in both cases , the @xmath5 variables , and as a result the atoms , can more easily overcome free energy barriers present in the system .    despite this acceleration ,",
    "the reconstruction of the free energy surface @xmath12 by `` binning and histogramming '' is very expensive .",
    "however , often we are interested only in the identification of metastable states and the characterization of their relative stability",
    ". this task can be accomplished by following a more efficient , two steps approach . in the first step",
    "the @xmath6-space is scanned by relatively short tamd / tamc or metadynamics runs .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6-space trajectory is analyzed to find `` clusters '' @xcite , i.e. those regions in the @xmath6-space where the trajectory variables tends to spend a significant amount of time .",
    "these runs must be long enough to allow the identification of metastable states on @xmath12 but can be significantly shorter than the length required to accurately reconstruct the free energy surface . in the second step ,",
    "the difference in free energy of two of the metastable states identified in the previous step is calculated by numerically integrating the mean force @xmath13 along a path connecting them ( thermodynamic integration ) . by repeating this operation for a proper set of pairs of states it is possible to reconstruct the relative free energy of all the metastable states .",
    "the @xmath13 can be estimated by computing the ensemble average conditional to @xmath14 of a suitable observable ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "this task can be performed by restrained ( constrained @xcite ) md or mc @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that there are no free energy barriers in the domain orthogonal to the @xmath6-space , as otherwise the sampling of the conditional probability density function @xmath15 would be quite inefficient .",
    "we explain the problem of sampling @xmath15 by the following example .",
    "consider a free energy surface of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2cv ] . in this system",
    "there are two slow degrees of freedom , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but the two metastable states can be characterized by only @xmath16 : the first corresponds to the condition @xmath18 , and the second one corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "this means that , indeed , we can determine their relative stability by integrating @xmath20 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , we notice that the free energy profile in the direction @xmath23 for a fixed value of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) presents a barrier higher than the thermal energy . as a result ,",
    "the sampling of @xmath26 by restrained / constrained md , or any other standard method , is biased .        in principle , this problem could be solved by including all the slow degrees of freedom in the @xmath6-space .",
    "however , already the identification of the collective variables characterizing the metastable states is very difficult and the identification of all the slow degrees of freedoms along the paths connecting these states often results just impossible . in this paper we illustrate how it is possible , by combining restrained md with the parallel tempering @xcite , to compute the difference in free energy between two metastable states even in presence of unknown slow degrees of freedom .",
    "we apply this method to the study of the phase diagram of si nanoparticles embedded in amorphous silica ( a - sio@xmath27 ) .",
    "we study the nature of the most stable phase as a function of the size and temperature of the nanoparticle . anticipating our results",
    ", we found that , at variance with bulk si , in small nanoparticles ( @xmath28  nm ) at low @xmath2 ( @xmath29  k ) the most stable phase is the disordered one . for larger nanoparticles",

    "we further assume that , even if @xmath48 is not the only slow collective variable , it is a good order parameter for the process under investigation . in this case",
    "the free energy profile might look like those reported in the top panels of fig .",

    "we keep sampling along this valley up to the point in which the barrier separating the two valleys is lower than the thermal energy . at this point",
    "the system will collapse in the other basin and , by increasing @xmath24 , it will go toward the second minimum . pushing the system forward along @xmath24",

    "@xmath54-@xmath56 and @xmath56-@xmath57 @xmath20 will be negative and positive , respectively , and the free energy will present a second minimum .",
    "the free energy profile associated to this path is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis]/a and is represented by a dashed line with an arrow indicating the direction along which the thermodynamic integration is performed .",
    "let us not perform the same ideal experiment going in the other direction : from high to low @xmath24",
    ". in this case the path , denoted by a dotted line , will follow the other valley . as a result",
    "the free energy barrier is shifted even if the position of the minima is correctly computed . however , the relative free energy of the two metastable states is wrong following both the low - to - high and the high - to - low paths as the @xmath20 was obtained from a bad sampling of @xmath51 .",
    "however , we must consider also the case , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis]/b , in which the two valleys are very long and the point in which the system collapse in the other basin ( segment @xmath54-@xmath56 ) is very close , or beyond , the second minimum ( see dashed and dotted path in panel b ) . in the first case the mean force will be negative but small along this segment , while in the second case it will be positive . depending on the exact placement of this segment ,",

    "this second example illustrates that also the qualitative picture of the free energy surface can be falsified if not all the slow degrees of freedom are taken into account , despite the ones considered could be the good order parameters for the process considered . in the next section , we will illustrate how this problem can be solved by combining restrained md with the parallel tempering .      in parallel tempering the simulated system",

    "the swapping move , then , allows the low @xmath2 replica to sample these states too .",
    "this explains why , when the system presents energy barriers , parallel tempering with @xmath58 replicas is more efficient than standard mc of length @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of steps of the parallel tempering simulation .",

    "the second one , very broad and small , is usually assigned to the second neighbor pairs , which in amorphous system are distributed over a broad @xmath167 range .",
    "there is no other peak in the @xmath165    domain . comparing the @xmath162 of the low @xmath141 metastable state of this particle with amorphous bulk",
    "si we notice that there is a one to one correspondence between the equivalent peaks in the two system .",
    "similar results are found for the @xmath158  nm and @xmath159  nm nanoparticles ( see the central and right - most panels of figs .  [",
    "fig : grvst ] , respectively ) . on the basis of this analysis",
    ", we identified the high @xmath141 metastable state of all the nanoparticles at all temperatures as crystalline and the one at low @xmath141 as amorphous .",
    "our simulations ( see fig .  [ fofq6 ] ) provide the following qualitative sharp picture : for small nano - particles ( @xmath168  nm ) at low temperature ( t @xmath169c ) the most stable phase is the amorphous one .",
    "the crystalline phase becomes equiprobable ( @xmath157  nm ) or more probable ( @xmath158  nm ) at higher temperatures . on the contrary , for larger particles ( @xmath170  nm )",
    "the behavior is bulk - like : at low temperatures ( t @xmath171  c ) the crystalline phase is the most stable one while at higher temperatures the amorphous phase is preferred . let us quickly summarize some experimental findings that we will use for comparison .",
    "results from energy filtered transmission electron microscopy ( eftem ) and dark - field transmission electron microscopy ( dftem ) on si - rich sio@xmath172 show that si nanoparticles start to form at @xmath173c @xcite . at this temperature",
    "they are all amorphous , while at @xmath174c about one third become crystalline . by further increasing the temperature by @xmath175c ,",
    "the fraction of crystalline nanoparticles rises up to  60% , while the average size of the nano - particles and the distribution of their size remains almost unchanged .",
    "finally , at @xmath176c 100% of nano - particles are crystalline . at this temperature the average size",
    "is slightly increased , but the particle size distribution still overlaps with the distributions at @xmath174c and @xmath177c .",
    "our results provide the following interpretation of the these experimental results . at low temperatures the nanoparticles are small ( as shown by experiments ) and amorphous due to the found inversion of stability for nanoparticle of this size . at moderately higher temperatures , when size distribution of the nanoparticles is essentially unchanged",
    ", the larger nanoparticles in the sample transform from amorphous to crystalline , as the amorphous - to - crystalline transition temperature is lower for these particles . by further increasing the temperature the average size of the nano - particles increases significantly and almost all the nanoparticles transform into crystalline as at this size and temperature",
    "this is the most stable phase .",
    "the remaining small nanoparticles are crystalline too due to the inversion of stability .",
    "in other words , our results bring to the conclusion that the observed crystallization of the nanoparticles with the increase of the temperature is due to the interplay of the effect of the temperature on their size and the inversion of the relative stability of the amorphous and crystalline phase with the temperature for small nanoparticles .",
    "we have introduced a combined restrained md / parallel tempering approach to compute the difference in free energy as a function of a ( a set of ) collective variable between two metastable states in presence of unknown slow degrees of freedom .",
    "we have applied the rmd - pt approach to the study of the phase diagram of si nanoparticles embedded in amorphous silica as a function of their size and the system temperature .",
    "we found that , at variance with bulk si , at low @xmath2 the small nanoparticles are amorphous , undergoing an amorphous - to - crystalline phase transition at higher @xmath2 .",
    "large nanoparticles instead recover , as expected , the bulk - like behavior ; crystalline at low @xmath2 and amorphous at higher @xmath2 .",
    "we also investigated the structure of the nanoparticles , finding that , in agreement with previous works @xcite , the crystalline nanoparticles are formed by an ordered core surrounded by a disordered periphery .",
