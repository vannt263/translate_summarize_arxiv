    "experiments with high - energy heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) in relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern revealed interesting properties of created hot matter called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "one of the curious properties found in hic experiments is the early thermalization ; the thermalization time is estimated to be @xmath1 from the analysis of the data obtained by rhic using relativistic hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "this thermalization time is considerably smaller compared with the prediction by perturbative qcd  @xcite . to tackle the problem , we need to understand the non - equilibrium qcd dynamics starting from the realistic initial condition for hic .",
    "the key issues for elucidating the possible mechanism of the early thermalization are how and when entropy is produced in the early stage of hic .",
    "nuclear wave functions before the collision are considered to be described by the color glass condensate caused by the gluon saturation  @xcite , where the ( semi-)classical approximation is valid  @xcite .",
    "the matter created just after the collision of two nuclei has a specific configuration of the fields called  glasma \"  @xcite , where color - electric and -magnetic fields are aligned parallel to the collision axis between two colliding nuclei .",
    "it is suggested that the glasma state induces some instabilities , i.e. , weibel and nielsen - olesen instabilities  @xcite , which may cause isotropization at early time , and hence hopefully thermalization @xcite .",
    "one should , however , note that the matter which can be well described by the dissipative hydrodynamics does not necessarily have isotropic particle distribution .",
    "a direct examination of the entropy production in the early stage of hic is done in refs .",
    "@xcite , where kolmogorov - sina ( ks ) entropy is given as the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents calculated through solving the time evolution of cym ; the positive lyapunov exponents and thus kolmogorov - sina ( ks ) entropy represent the mixing property of the system .",
    "see @xcite for early investigations of the chaotic behavior of cym . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors solved the equation of motion of cym starting from glasma - like initial conditions , and found a large number of positive lyapunov exponents in the early stage when the initial field fluctuations are included , and even for later times their number is a sizeable fraction of the total number of degrees of freedom , indicating a significant amount of entropy is produced by _ classical gluon field _",
    "dynamics , i.e. , the dynamics in the early stage of hic .",
    "they emphasized that the field fluctuation at the initial state is crucial for the entropy production even when glasma - like initial conditions are adopted .    while the early stage of hic should be well described as a classical system , the system _ is _ nothing more than a quantum system @xmath2 for which the gluon field @xmath3 has an expectation value @xmath4 ; @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 in some measure .",
    "the quantum statistical entropy is given by the von neumann entropy @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the density matrix of the system .",
    "our idea is that the quantum state of the gluon fields in the initial stage of hic may be well described by a coherent state  @xcite ; @xmath10 , where the coherent state @xmath11 is given solely in terms of the classical fields @xmath4 ; the explicit construction of @xmath11 is given in the next section .",
    "then the time evolution of the density matrix and hence the von neumann entropy can be obtained from the classical dynamics .",
    "however , the things do not go so easy : information loss of the system is indispensable for the entropy production . indeed ,",
    "if the system stays in a pure state , where the time evolution is given by a unitary operator , the entropy keeps zero value , as is well known .",
    "thus the system must be or turn to a mixed state to produce the entropy .",
    "the conversion from a pure to mixed state or decoherence may be achieved through the interaction of the system with its environment  @xcite .",
    "the decoherence process can be nicely described in terms of the density matrix @xmath9 ; the nondiagonal elements tends to vanish while the diagonal elements of @xmath9 becomes semi - positive definite in certain representation in the course of decoherence .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , an estimate of the decoherence time @xmath12 of the gluon ensemble in hic is given in a leading - order approximation , and it is argued that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the saturation scale of the collision .",
    "they also estimate the amount of entropy production during the decoherence from the number of decohering gluons per a coherent domain  @xcite , and found that the produced entropy is roughly one - third of that measured in the final hadron distribution .     to be liberated at time",
    "@xmath15 provided that a complete decoherence occurs there , whereas the dashed - black line is the entropy for a pure state .",
    "the time evolution of the system is assumed to be described as that of a coherent state until a time @xmath16 when decoherence takes place ; then the density matrix becomes diagonal so that the von neumann entropy becomes positive .",
    "a possible time - dependence of entropy after @xmath16 is expressed by the dotted - red line .",
    ", width=302 ]    in the present paper , we propose a new method for the calculation of the entropy in the initial stage of hic on the basis of a new scenario of the entropy production by decoherence . as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pic_dec ] , we assume that there is a stage where the gluon system evolves quantum - mechanically from glasma initial conditions before the occurrence of the decoherence at a time @xmath16 : the gluon system is assumed to be described by a coherent state as in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the time dependence of the expectation value of gauge fields by the coherent state is obtained from that of the classical gluon fields . in this study",
    ", we do not refer to any specific process of the decoherence in the study , and simply assume that a complete decoherence occurs at @xmath16 .",
    "then the density matrix becomes diagonal in the gluon fock state basis @xmath17 , whose diagonal matrix elements are given in terms of the time - dependent coherent state , and thereby we can calculate the von neumann entropy of the system from the diagonalized decoherent density matrix @xmath18 constructed from cym dynamics , its best quantum analogue ( the time - dependent coherent states ) , and the decoherence assumption . notice that the entropy obtained through a completed decoherence gives a maximum one produced by a possible decoherence of a coherent state .",
    "this kind of entropy is referred to as  decoherence entropy \" , because the diagonalization of the density matrix is caused by decoherence of a quantum state @xcite .    as is mentioned above ,",
    "the chaotic behavior of gluon fields is related to the production of ks entropy , and the fluctuation of the initial state is crucial for the production @xcite .",
    "as we will see , longitudinal fluctuations in the glasma initial conditions make the von neumann entropy much larger , as is the case for kolmogorov - sina entropy .",
    "this indicates that the initial fluctuation of classical chromo - electric and magnetic fields is crucial for the production of the entropy , and the production of the entropy would explain the early thermalization .",

    "<S> we propose a new prescription for evaluating a von neumann entropy in the initial stage of high - energy heavy - ion collisions utilizing the time evolution of classical yang - mills ( cym ) field : the von neumann entropy is computed for the quantum coherent states constructed so as to give the classical gluon fields as the expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is to be liberated when the complete decoherence is achieved . as a demonstration , </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the cym dynamics is solved with an initial condition which mimics the glasma state , though in a non - expanding geometry ; the glasma state is characterized by the longitudinal color - electric and -magnetic fields with gluon fields fluctuations around it . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the initial longitudinal fluctuations of the fields play essential roles for the entropy production in two ways : first , the field fluctuations at @xmath0 themselves act as a source of the von neumann entropy prepared before the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> second , the initial fluctuations triggers field instabilities , and hence the larger the strength of them , the more the entropy production at later time . </S>"
