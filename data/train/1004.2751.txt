    "the superconductivity of the quaternary transition metal oxyphosphides lafepo ( @xmath4  =  3.2  k ) and lanipo ( @xmath4 = 3.0  4.3 k ) was discovered recently@xcite although these compounds have been under study for more than ten years .",
    "@xcite in spite of the relatively low superconducting transition temperatures @xmath4 , these materials are important because they triggered the extensive search for superconductivity in oxyarsenides @xmath5aso ( where @xmath6 = la , ce , pr , nd , sm , gd ; @xmath7 = 3@xmath1 metals ) .",
    "this search has proven to be remarkably successful , reaching @xmath4s of up to 55 k@xcite and strong upper critical fields h@xmath8 of up to 100  t.  @xcite    despite the focus on oxyarsenides , ni and fe oxyphosphides still attract attention@xcite because while they share the same bi - layer structure as @xmath5aso materials , the mechanism for superconductivity appears to be different .",
    "in particular the value of the total electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath9 in lafeaso is much lower than in conventional electron - phonon coupling superconductors , for example , compare the @xmath9 = 0.21 of lafeaso@xcite with the @xmath9 = 0.44 of al ( where @xmath4 = 1.3 k for al ) , and even the inclusion of multiband effects fails to explain the observed @xmath4 of 26 k.  @xcite for lanipo the coupling constant is more then two times higher ( @xmath9 = 0.58 ) and the superconducting properties can be described within the migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "@xcite herein we interpret soft x - ray emission and absorption spectra of lanipo and lafeaso@xcite and compare the measurements with our local density approximation with dynamical mean field theory ( lda+dmft ) electronic structure calculations to investigate the similarities and differences between these two types of superconductors . to assist in investigating these materials , electronic structure calculations of lafepo@xcite (",
    "@xmath4 = 3.2 k@xcite ) and nio@xcite were used .",
    "lafeaso , unlike lanipo and lafepo , is not superconducting unless doping@xcite or high pressure@xcite is applied to suppress the magnetic transition temperature .",
    "@xcite since these materials share the same basic ambient crystal structure and atomic constituents , yet exhibit different low - temperature properties , a basic study of the ambient electronic structure of these three materials is of interest , especially since the bulk electronic structure of these materials is insensitive to temperature or magnetic phase changes .",
    "single crystals of lanipo were synthesized by heating a mixture of 375.0 mg la ( 99.9% , smart elements ) , 201.7 mg nio ( 99.99% , sigma - aldrich ) and 83.6 mg p ( red , 99% , sigma - aldrich ) with 2000 mg sn ( 99.99% , alfa aesar ) in an alumina crucible , which was sealed in a silica tube under an atmosphere of purified argon .",
    "the sample was heated to 1173 k at a rate of 40 k / h , kept at this temperature for 10 days and slowly cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 3 k / h .",
    "the crucible was smashed and the tin bar dissolved in 6 m hcl at room temperature . the remaining sample consisted of single crystals of lanipo beside small amounts of lani@xmath10p@xmath10 ( 7% ) , ni@xmath10snp ( 4% ) and ni@xmath11sn@xmath12",

    "further attempts to optimize the synthesis conditions with regard to reaction temperature or duration were unsuccessful .",
    "samples prepared directly from the starting material without tin flux yielded only small amounts of lanipo with lani@xmath10p@xmath10 as the main product . for details of preparation see  ref .  .",
    "the soft x - ray absorption and emission measurements of the metal @xmath0 edges were performed at the soft x - ray fluorescence endstation of beamline 8.0.1 at the advanced light source in the lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "@xcite the endstation uses a rowland circle geometry x - ray spectrometer with spherical gratings and an area - sensitive multichannel detector .",

    "additional non - resonant xes measurements of the ni @xmath0 edges of ni metal foil and nio were obtained as reference standard .",
    "the instrumental resolving power ( e/@xmath17e ) for emission measurements was about 10@xmath18 .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) were measured in total electron yield ( tey ) mode for the ni @xmath0 edges .",
    "the instrumental resolving power ( e/@xmath17e ) for absorption measurements was about 5 @xmath19 10@xmath18 .",
    "all absorption spectra were normalized to the incident photon current using a highly transparent gold mesh in front of the sample to correct for intensity fluctuations in the incoming photon beam .",
    "the excitation energies for the ni @xmath0 resonant x - ray emission spectra were determined from the xas spectra and the energies were selected at the @xmath3 and @xmath2 thresholds .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed within the pseudopotential plane - wave method pwscf , as implemented in the quantum espresso package .  @xcite we used the generalized gradient approximation in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof version@xcite for the exchange - correlation potential in the rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos form .",

    "the 3@xmath1 spectral function is close to the noncorrelated lda density of states .",
    "however , below these energies the spectral function is substantially renormalized with the formation of a strong peak at 1.5  ev , and the appearance of a lower hubbard band : the broad peak centered at 9.1  ev .",
    "thus this picture resembles the lda+dmft results for lafeaso@xcite ( upper panel ) only for the energies above 6 ev , since in lafeaso the lower hubbard band was not found . in nio , however , a similar broad peak centered at @xmath2810 ev is obtained , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "the resonant @xmath2 and @xmath3 xes ( curves b and c in the bottom panels , respectively ) have the same basic shape .",

    "the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratios were calculated by taking the quotient of the integrals of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    the ratio of the integral - intensity of the metal @xmath2 and @xmath3 peaks ( the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratio ) for lafeaso is roughly the same as that of metallic fe , and quite different from that of strongly correlated feo ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , right side , bottom panel ) . in a free atom , the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 )",
    "ratio should be equal to 1/2 as the ratio is based solely on the statistical population of the 2@xmath16@xmath29 and 2@xmath16@xmath30 levels .",
    "in metals the radiationless @xmath2@xmath3@xmath31 coster - kronig ( c - k ) transitions greatly reduce the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratio ,  @xcite and the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath2 ) ratio can be used as a measure for the electron correlation strength of a transition metal compound@xcite ( see fig .",

    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the @xmath3 band in lafeaso is again closer to that of metallic fe than feo ( see fig .",

    "while this does not directly prove anything , it suggests that the fe 3@xmath1 electronic structure of lafeaso may be similar to that of metallic fe . the shape and statistics of the fe @xmath0 xes",
    "indicate that the fe 3@xmath1 states in lafeaso are not strongly correlated .",
    "in contrast to lafeaso , the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratio for lanipo is much greater than that of ni metal , as is the fwhm of the lanipo @xmath3 band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , left side , bottom panel ) .",
    "indeed , the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratio and @xmath3 fwhm for lanipo ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , left side , top and middle panels ) are rather close to those of correlated nio . since the transition metal i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratio is over 50% greater in lanipo than lafeaso , and since in nio is comparable to feo in terms of `` correlation strength '' ,  @xcite the ni 3@xmath1 states are more correlated than the lafeaso fe 3@xmath1 states .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of lanipo excited by synchrotron soft x - ray emission and absorption spectroscopy and obtained the theoretical spectral functions within the combination of local density approximation with dynamical mean - field theory ( lda+dmft ) .",
    "we conclude that the ni 3@xmath1 states of lanipo reside deeper in the valence band than the fe 3@xmath1 states of lafeaso .",
    "the greater occupation in the metal 3@xmath1 bands in lanipo reduces the density of the states at the fermi level and increases the hybridization with o 2@xmath16 states compared to those in lafeaso .",
    "accounting for dynamical correlation in the ni 3@xmath1 states of lanipo results in the renormalization of the states below the fermi energy and the formation of the lower hubbard band centered at 9 ev , similar to nio , but in contrast to lafeaso .",
    "the i(@xmath2)/i(@xmath3 ) ratio is much higher in lanipo than in lafeaso , indicating the ni 3@xmath1 states of lanipo have stronger electron correlations than the fe 3@xmath1 states of lafeaso .",

    "<S> we further obtain a lower hubbard band at 9 ev below the fermi level in lanipo which bears striking resemblance to the lower hubbard band in the correlated oxide nio , while no such band is observed in lafeaso . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also supported by the intensity ratio between the transition metal @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands measured experimentally to be higher in lanipo than in lafeaso , indicating the presence of the stronger electron correlations in the ni 3@xmath1 states in lanipo in comparison with the fe 3@xmath1 states in lafeaso . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are in accordance with resonantly excited transition metal @xmath3 x - ray emission spectra which probe occupied metal 3@xmath1-states and show the appearance of the lower hubbard band in lanipo and nio and its absence in lafeaso . </S>"
