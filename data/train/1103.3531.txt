    "salient features in an image have the defining property that they instantly attract our visual attention towards their locations without the need to scan the entire image systematically  they are image features which have a  pop out \" effect @xcite . in addition , such features are in some sense rare or unique  they have a low probability of being mistaken for other features in an image , and often best distinguish one particular object category from another @xcite",
    ". this property may allow the visual system to rapidly segment and classify an image based on its most distinctive features , or to devote further visual processing resources to specific points in an image .",
    "in evolutionary terms a rapid response to salient features could be critical for biological systems in predator - prey situations . in computer vision",
    ", saliency has been shown to improve performance in object and feature recognition tasks @xcite .",
    "saliency is thought to be assigned early in the visual pathway , and models of the primary visual cortex ( v1 ) are often used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "one reason is that saliency is assumed to involve only bottom - up ( image - based ) mechanisms which group simple features together and process a scene rapidly and in parallel over the entire visual field @xcite .",
    "later stages of visual attention probably involve top - down ( task - dependent ) cues @xcite .",
    "long range horizontal connections in v1 provide a likely mechanism for rapid integration of information across the visual field @xcite .",
    "the salient objects we shall mostly be concerned with in this work are closed contours  such as the boundaries of objects and surfaces in images .",
    "simple cells in v1 respond best to oriented bars and edges like those detected using a gabor filter @xcite , and a contour is represented as a discrete set of line segments in v1",
    ". however , any given image will result in many line segments in v1 , and most of these will be unrelated to any salient contour .",
    "long - range horizontal connections modulate neural activity , and provide a mechanism for grouping together line segments that form salient contours .",
    "for example , two tangents are said to be co - circular when they are tangent to the same circle @xcite .",
    "if horizontal connections facilitate co - circularity then neural activity will be higher ( and the feature more salient ) when line segments form a circular contour rather than a cluttered background of line segments with random orientations and positions , for example .",
    "experiments on contour detection by the human visual system have shown that contour saliency depends on factors such as contour length , curvature , degree of fragmentation , whether the contour is open or closed , and the statistical properties of the background relative to the contour @xcite .",
    "line segments which are co - linear ( i.e. lie on a straight line and are orientated in the same direction as the line ) are highly salient , but saliency decreases as the line segments are either separated or their relative orientations are changed @xcite . the saliency of a contour can be increased either by increasing the contour length or by closing the contour , but decreases with increase in the contour curvature @xcite .",
    "a final point is that saliency also depends on the statistical properties of the background ",
    "false contours formed by fortuitously aligned background line segments will decrease contour saliency @xcite .",

    "[ sec3 ] when choosing a form for horizontal connections .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a neural model with v1 architecture that can be used to detect visually salient contours in images .",
    "we would also like to determine what level of performance is possible in such tasks using a simple v1 architecture .",
    "this architecture includes functionally specific long - range horizontal connections , local feedback connections , thresholding , and neural orientation preference .",
    "a key motivation is to see how a biophysically - constrained model of v1 can be used to assign saliency in the 10 - 20 ms period available under certain viewing conditions @xcite .",
    "we would also like to provide a solid framework for including horizontal connections into certain classes of biologically - inspired hierarchical neural networks used for object recognition @xcite .",
    "we start with a model of neural activity ( spike - rate ) dynamics such as used in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for describing populations of v1 neurons . from these dynamical equations a convolution model is derived under the assumption that horizontal connections only modulate neural activity rather than drive it .",
    "a convolution model has the advantage that it avoids the stability problems found in dynamical neural models @xcite .",
    "operating as a feed - forward network , the convolution model increases the activity of line segments facilitated by the horizontal connections .",
    "alternatively , operating as a feedback network , it increases the activity of facilitated line segments over several iterations through cooperative interactions .",
    "previous models of salient contour detection can be divided approximately into two classes : v1-like neural models with horizontal connections @xcite , and non - neural models as typified by refs .  @xcite .",
    "although the non - neural models are interesting in their own right , here our primary interest is in biologically - inspired visual processing , and we will not further consider non - neural models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , neural elements were represented by gabor patches , and a dynamical model with facilitatory horizontal connections and global inhibition was assumed .",
    "horizontal connections involved fitting a cubic spline between pairs of neighboring patches , then including penalties for distance , curvature , and change in curvature  such that co - linear and co - circular neighbors were facilitated .",
    "a region was salient when its steady state response reached a certain out - lier criterion level separating background noise from signal . in ref .",
    "@xcite , neural elements were grouped using a model with facilitatory horizontal connections and various forms of competitive inhibition .",
    "horizontal connections were formed from an association field similar to that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and co - circular neighbors were facilitated .",
    "global inhibition was used to suppress weakly facilitated elements , and the remaining elements were modeled as phase oscillators .",
    "salient regions exhibited phase synchrony due to strong facilitatory interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , each edge segment represented a pair of neural elements , one excitatory and one inhibitory , which were described using a dynamical model with horizontal connections .",
    "facilitation came from an association field , and inhibition was given by so - called _ flank inhibition _ @xcite .",
    "saliency was related to the activity level at the steady state .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear dynamical properties of this model caused gaps in contours to be filled in , and activity to leak out across boundaries @xcite .    the structure of this paper is as follows : in sec .",

    "the model we consider describes the processing of visual information in a sequence of stages which reside in early parts of the visual pathway .",
    "visual input from an image arrives at v1 simple cells , which respond most strongly to visual features such as a bar or edge of a particular orientation .",
    "dynamical processes then rapidly redistribute the neural input among the simple cells via functionally - specific long range horizontal connections .",
    "once neural activity reaches equilibrium after approximately 10 ms it is either directly output to later stages of the visual pathway , or else iterated several times through thresholding and local feedback connections before being output to later stages .",
    "the most salient regions in the image correspond to the regions of highest activity in the v1 model output .",
    "we now describe the three stages in greater detail .",
    "visual input to the model comes from an image , and is given by the set of intensity values @xmath0 for each point @xmath1 in the image . to construct the simple cell classical receptive fields ,",

    "the equation for neural - activity dynamics has a similar form to that used in coarse - grained models of v1 @xcite , and is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 ms is the membrane time constant over which incoming action potential spikes are smoothed into pulses at the synapses of a neuron , and @xmath25 is the population spiking rate , given by @xmath26 which is a sigmoid - shaped function , with spiking - rate threshold @xmath27 , and width @xmath7 .",

    "in this work , our primary aim has been to establish a solid foundation for modeling horizontal connections in biological neural networks .",

    "open contours getting shorter and shorter with each iteration as line segments were discarded from the ends , while closed contours remained unchanged . for the detection of non - circular closed contours facilitation of line segments of all orientations was found to be necessary .",

    "finally , we showed how our model can operate as either a feed - forward or a feedback network .",

    "several further questions remain .",
    "firstly , it is difficult to know what model parameter values are actually used in computations involving v1 horizontal connections .",
    "it seems unlikely that precise definitions such as co - circularity are implemented by horizontal connections ",
    "this property would only apply to a small number of all salient contours .",
    "we favor a less stringent construction involving a modified association field . also , scale invariance has been observed in natural images . to include",
    "this in our model would require a range of receptive field sizes and horizontal connection ranges to be considered .",
    "the performance of our model in the successful detection of a salient feature depends on details of the background clutter relative to the feature .",
    "for example , operating as a feedback network , the number of iterations taken to distinguish between open and closed contours will depend directly on contour length .",
    "a long open contour will take a larger number of iterations to resolve than a short one .",
    "similarly , detecting the most salient feature from a set of salient features could also take a large number of iterations .",

    "<S> a convolution model which accounts for neural activity dynamics in the primary visual cortex is derived and used to detect visually salient contours in images . </S>",
    "<S> image inputs to the model are modulated by long - range horizontal connections , allowing contextual effects in the image to determine visual saliency , i.e.  line segments arranged in a closed contour elicit a larger neural response than line segments forming background clutter . </S>",
    "<S> the model is tested on 3 types of contour , including a line , a circular closed contour , and a non - circular closed contour . using a modified association field to describe horizontal connections the model is found to perform well for different parameter values . for each type of contour a different facilitation mechanism </S>",
    "<S> is found . </S>",
    "<S> operating as a feed - forward network , the model assigns saliency by increasing the neural activity of line segments facilitated by the horizontal connections . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , operating as a feedback network , the model can achieve further improvement over several iterations through cooperative interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this model has no dynamical stability issues , and is suitable for use in biologically - inspired neural networks . </S>"
