    "recently georgi proposed an interesting idea to describe possible scale invariant effect at low energies by unparticles@xcite .",
    "it was argued that operators @xmath4 made of fields in the scale invariant sector may interact with operators @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 made of standard model ( sm ) fields at some high energy scale by exchanging particles with large masses , @xmath7 , with the generic form @xmath8 . at another scale",
    "@xmath9 the scale invariant sector induce dimensional transmutation , below that scale the operator @xmath4 matches onto an unparticle operator @xmath10 with dimension @xmath2 and the unparticle interaction with sm particles at low energy has the form @xmath11    study of unparticle effects has drawn a lot of attentions from more theoretically related work to more phenomenologically studies .",
    "there are many possible ways unparticles may interact with the sm particles@xcite .",
    "most of the phenomenological work concentrate on possible effects of unparticle interactions with sm particles and constraints on the interaction strength @xmath12 .",
    "one of the subjects where a lot of activities have been devoted to is the study of low energy rare flavor changing processes involving quarks@xcite and charged leptons@xcite . in this work",
    "we study unparticle effects on @xmath0 and constrain unparticle interactions using known sm values and current experimental data for @xmath13 .",
    "the rare @xmath14 decay process has been shown to provide interesting constraints on possible new physics beyond the sm@xcite .",
    "experimentally the leading contribution to @xmath13 with large @xmath15 energy @xmath16 is dominated by @xmath14 . experimental measurement on this decay",
    "has achieved very high precision with @xmath17 given by@xcite @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "on the theoretical side , the sm calculation for @xmath17 has been evaluated at the nnlo order @xcite with @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear that experimental data and sm prediction agree with each other very well leaving small room for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "taking this on the positive side , the process @xmath1 can provide stringent constraints on possible new physics beyond the sm .",
    "several flavor changing processes have been studied@xcite , but unparticle contribution to @xmath14 has not been studied .",
    "we therefore concentrate on this subject .",
    "although at present the detailed dynamics for interaction between unparticles and sm particles are not known , unparticle effects on various physical processes can be studied from effective theory point of view using eq.([eff ] ) .",
    "the main task is then , as many phenomenological studies of unparticle physics , to use available data to constrain the allowed parameter space and to see how large the unparticle effects can be and to test possible effects experimentally .    in principle , when the unparticle sector is coupled to the sm sector the scale invariance is broken due to finite mass of the sm fields@xcite and also due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of higgs vacuum expectation value if coupled@xcite .",
    "the unparticle behavor may only exist in a window below the scale @xmath22 and above a scale @xmath23 where the scale invariance is broken again by sm particle effects .",
    "if this is the case , the contributions of the unparticles should only be within this window and below @xmath23 the effects should be replace by that resulted from the residual degrees of freedom .",
    "however , at this stage there is no specific way , as far as we know , to describe such effects . in our study of unparticle effects on @xmath0 , we will follow most of the phenomenological studies in the literature assuming that the unparticle effects from the scale @xmath22 down to zero .    we will study @xmath14 using the lowest possible dimension operators due to scalar and vector unparticle and sm fields interactions .",
    "the unparticle contributions can contribute significantly to both left- and right - handed chirality amplitudes .",
    "using available experimental data and sm calculation mentioned above , we obtain constraints on various vector and scalar unparticle couplings . we find that the constraints sensitively depend on the unparticle dimension @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath2 close to one , the constraints can be very stringent .",
    "the constraints become weak when @xmath2 is increased . in general",
    "the constraints on scalar unparticle couplings are weaker than those for vector unparticle couplings .",
    "sizeable coupling strength for unparticles with quarks is still allowed .",
    "we also find that polarization measurement in @xmath3 can further constraint the couplings .",
    "the lowest dimension operators , which can generate contributions to @xmath24 at one loop level , come from interaction of vector unparticle with quarks and are given by@xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the sm left - handed quark doublet , and right - handed down - quark , respectively .",
    "scalar unparticle interaction with quarks can also induce @xmath28 .",
    "the lowest dimension operators which can contribute to @xmath14 is at order @xmath29 .",
    "the following operator will generate finite contributions to @xmath14 at one loop level@xcite",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sm higgs doublet transforming under the sm gauge group @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "after the higgs develops a non - zero vacuum expectation value @xmath34 , the above interaction between quarks and an unparticle becomes @xmath35    at the same order in @xmath22 , there are several other operators involving quarks and a scalar unparticle , such as@xcite @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "however , their one loop contributions to @xmath24 diverge due to derivative couplings .",
