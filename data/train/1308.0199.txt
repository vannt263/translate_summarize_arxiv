    "is expected to have many advantages . in ferromagnet thin film , moments lie within the plane to minimize the magnetostatic energy . a thin film with the in - plane magnetization has a surface spin - wave mode called damon - eshbach ( de ) mode ,  @xcite where spin wave propagates in a chiral direction transverse to the in - plane moment .",
    "the mode realizes a unidirectional spin transport in the two - dimensional ( 2-@xmath0 ) top surface of the film and the counter - propagating transport in the bottom surface .",

    "the chiral direction is transverse to the out - of - plane ferromagnetic moment ; the mode realizes a unidirectional spin - wave propagation along the one - dimensional boundary of the plane , instead of along the top ( or bottom ) surface .",
    "such chiral edge modes could possibly connect various elements in 2-@xmath0 spin - current circuits in more flexible way than the de surface mode .",
    "moreover , the chiral direction ( whether clockwise or counterclockwise ) and number of the edge modes ( can be more than one ) are determined by a sum of the topological number ( chern integer ) defined for the volume - mode bands below the gap .",
    "@xcite this enables us to control the direction and number of the edge modes in terms of a band gap manipulation , bringing up further prospect for spin - current circuits with richer structures .",
    "@xcite to make such spin - wave circuits experimentally , it is much more important for theory to propose a number of structured thin films which have these topological modes .    in this paper , we introduce an efficient method of constructing the topological chiral edge modes in realistic dipolar magnetic thin films .",
    "we considered that magnetic clusters , either thin rings or circular disks , form a 2-@xmath0 periodic square lattice . to study their spin - wave excitations , we derive several tight - binding models , using intuitive physical arguments .",

    "this feature is also justified by micromagnetic simulations .      in reality , the square - lattice models studied in this paper could be placed on some magnetic substrates . also , it is experimentally much easier to engrave only a surface of a plane thin film with some periodic structuring .",

    "thus , provided that neighboring gutters / cambers are proximate to each other , the band inversion mechanisms described in this paper are expected to be valid , leading to a band gap of soft volume - mode bands with a chiral ( counterclockwise ) edge mode .",
    "the argument is also applicable to thin film ferromagnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) , where relative strength between magnetic shape anisotropy and magnetic crystalline anisotropy ( mca ) is controlled by the film thickness .",
    "@xcite in an ultrathin film limit ( several atomic monolayer ) , the mca with easy - axis ( out - of - plane ) anisotropy dominates over the magnetostatic energy with easy - plane anisotropy , so that magnetic moments are polarized vertically to the plane .",
    "it has been experimentally known that increasing film thickness leads to spin - reorientation transition from out - of - plane magnetization to in - plane magnetization , which indicates that magnetic shape anisotropy overcomes the mca in thicker region .",
    "@xcite around the critical thickness , gapped spin wave modes are expected to become significantly softened .    regarding the film thickness as alternative to the magnetic field",
    ", one could also realize topological chiral spin - wave edge modes _ without any external magnetic field_. for example , consider that a surface of a thin - film pma material is engraved with cambers with a lattice periodicity as in fig .",

    "[ fig : recession](b ) , exchange processes due to magnetic dipole interaction give rise to considerable transfer integrals among these orbital wave functions .",
