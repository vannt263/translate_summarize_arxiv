    "the charge state dynamics of the nv can be described by a system of two first order linear rate equations @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the population probabilities of nv@xmath0 resp .",

    "the time evolution of @xmath15 is then given by @xmath62 which can be solved by diagonalizing @xmath29 . in our case ,",
    "the starting point @xmath63 after the first charge state detection measurement is always either @xmath64 ( for nv@xmath0 ) or @xmath65 ( for nv@xmath1 ) .",

    "the basic idea is that due to thermal effects and due to the spectral width of our supercontinuum laser ( of around 4  nm ) , we get a probability distribution for the energy absorbed by the electron ( for nv@xmath0 ) or by the hole ( for nv@xmath1 ) .",
    "since we do not know the energy distribution of the nv@xmath0 ground state due to thermal effects , we simply assume a gaussian distribution @xmath70 for the final energy @xmath71 of the electron ( hole ) after absorbing a photon , to approximately account for both the thermal effects and the spectral width of the photon , i.e. @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the desired photon energy , and @xmath43 is the width of the distribution , which will also be a fit parameter .",
    "the total ionization rate is given by the convolution of the final energy of the electron ( hole ) with the density of states ( dos ) for electrons in the conduction band ( for holes in the valence band ) .",
    "we approximate the band structure at the band edge with a parabola , such that the dos @xmath74 is the same as for a free electron gas , which is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the energy and @xmath77 the band edge energy relative to the ground state of nv@xmath0 .",

    "therefore , only the data up to 445  nm was used . for the recombination rate ,",
    "only four measurements points , which show a one photon process , are given .",
    "therefore , the dependency of the two fit parameters @xmath77 and @xmath43 is very high . for this fit",
