    "the theory of inelastic , low frequency , light scattering in molecular liquids has gone through different episodes over the years .",
    "the presence of a narrow inelastic doublet in the light scattering spectrum due to propagating sound waves was predicted by brillouin in 1922 @xcite .",
    "its first observation was reported in 1930 by gross , who noticed that the spectrum consisted of the brillouin doublet superimposed on a central rayleigh line @xcite .",
    "an explanation of this rayleigh - brillouin triplet , based on the equations of macroscopic hydrodynamics , was suggested by landau and placzek in 1934 @xcite and was given in complete form by mountain in 1966 @xcite .",
    "this hydrodynamic description did not take into account the nature of the constituents of the liquid .",
    "yet , it can play an important role and typical molecular effects have been detected on those low frequency spectra ( @xmath1 ghz ) .",
    "let us briefly mention three of them .",
    "one takes place with molecules that are non - spherical tops . in that case , both the molecular polarisability tensor and the tensor of inertia are anisotropic and they can reasonably be considered to depend only on the molecular orientation .",
    "the ( collective ) orientational dynamics of the molecules can thus be detected through the corresponding fluctuations of the anisotropic part of the dielectric tensor .",
    "this corresponds to a central peak with a line shape independent both of the scattering vector and of the polarisation of the incident and scattered beams .",
    "conversely , the tensorial character of the detection mechanism ( anisotropic part of the local dielectric tensor ) imposes specific relationships between the intensities of the spectra when recorded in different geometries .",
    "in particular , when , as is usually the case , dipole induced dipole effects ( did ) can be neglected @xcite , @xmath2 . here",
    "the first index corresponds to a vertical ( v ) polarisation of the incident beam , and the second index to a vertical ( v ) or horizontal ( h ) polarisation of the scattered beam , the scattering plane being horizontal .",
    "the second effect is the possible coupling of the density fluctuations with some internal degree of freedom of the molecule , having a temperature dependent lifetime , @xmath3 .",
    "mountain @xcite showed that , when @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the longitudinal phonon frequency , .",
    "] an additional central peak appears in the vv spectrum , which can be formally interpreted as the introduction of a retardation effect in the bulk viscosity of the liquid .    a third effect showed up in the study of the vh spectrum of viscous molecular liquids formed of anisotropic molecules .",
    "a wave - vector dependent feature was detected , which altered the line - shape of the central peak at moderate viscosities @xcite and transformed into an underdamped transverse phonon spectrum for higher viscosities @xcite .",
    "it was rapidly recognised that the additional spectrum was , indeed , due to a transverse , diffusive @xcite , or propagative @xcite excitation : any local shear motion inside the liquid couples to the mean local molecular orientation , and renders the latter anisotropic .",
    "this corresponds to a similar change of the mean molecular polarisability tensor .",
    "the detection mechanism of these shear modes is thus , as for the first effect , a change in the molecular orientations .    to rationalise the results obtained in vh light scattering experiments , some of the present authors ( c.d . and",
    "r.m.p ) and co - workers , @xcite here after referred to as [ i ] , proposed to somewhat generalise the usual hydrodynamic equations by incorporating through phenomenological arguments , in a systematic way :    \\a ) the coupling of the shear deformation to a local mean orientation of the molecules ;    \\b ) a retardation effect in each term corresponding to the damping of a variable .",
    "concentrating on the case of axially symmetric molecules , they characterised each of them by the orientation of its axis @xmath6 , with polar angles @xmath7 , represented by @xmath8 the local probability density of finding @xmath6 in that direction , and defined a set of orientational density variables , @xmath9 by : @xmath10   \\ , , \\ ] ] where latin indices @xmath11 represent cartesian components .",
    "the set of @xmath9 forms a symmetrical , traceless second rank tensor .",
    "it was proposed in [ i ] that the hydrodynamic equations pertinent to the case of a such a molecular viscous liquid would consist , after linearisation , of the two conservation laws :    @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mass density , @xmath15 is the mass current density .",
    "furthermore , they suggested the constitutive equations for the stress tensor : @xmath16 and for the orientation : @xmath17 here the momentum density @xmath18 is related to the velocity field @xmath19 via the mean mass density @xmath20 : @xmath21 the strain rate @xmath22 is a second rank symmetric and traceless tensor defined locally by : @xmath23 the pressure change @xmath24 is related to the instantaneous mass density change @xmath25 by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the relaxed sound velocity .",
    "the retarded couplings are given in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and are , respectively , the bulk and shear viscosities , the rotation - translation coupling and the orientational relaxation functions , the symbol @xmath30 standing for a convolution product in time . finally , @xmath31 is the libration frequency of the axial molecules and @xmath32 is the rotation - translation coupling constant , a quantity that takes into account the fact that @xmath33 and @xmath34 have different dimensions .    noting that , for motions that do not involve a local density change , the local dielectric tensor can be written , neglecting did effects , as : @xmath35 it was shown in [ i ] that the preceeding set of equations leads to an expression of the intensity that describes the complete thermal evolution of the vh spectrum of a supercooled molecular liquid .",
    "recently , another of the present authors ( a.l . ) and co - worker @xcite made an additional step . within the framework of the molecular mode coupling theory ( mmct )",
    "@xcite , they expressed the complete dynamics of a system of linear molecules characterised by the position of their center of mass and their orientation .",
    "they showed that , in the @xmath36 limit , both the correlation functions of the density fluctuations and of the orientation fluctuations contributed to the light scattering mechanism in the vv geometry .",
    "this result stressed the existence of a coupling between these two variables for a longitudinal phonon .",
    "nevertheless , the expression they obtained for the vv intensity did not make clear two aspects .",
    "one was the separation of the intensity into a @xmath0-independent term , representing a pure rotational dynamics , and a hydrodynamic contribution .",
    "the second was that the latter could be factorized into two parts : the longitudinal phonon propagator and a phonon - photon scattering term in which both the density and the orientational fluctuations enter on an equal footing .",
    "conversely , in another paper published soon after by two of the present authors ( t.f . and a.l . ) and co - workers @xcite , this separation into two different contributions and the emergence of several scattering channels was made apparent . yet",
    ", the technique used in @xcite did not imply any specific light scattering mechanism ; it was thus not possible to predict from that paper which terms would dominate the spectrum for a given physical system .",
    "the present series of papers aims at completing the picture of low frequency scattering in viscous molecular liquids through the combination of two different aspects . on the one hand",
    ", we shall present a full length , first principle derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ constitutive],[qosci ] ) through a zwanzig - mori approach and obtain from this technique the corresponding onsager conditions which , when met by the relaxation functions , guarantee the brillouin spectra to have a positive value whatever the frequency . on the other hand",
    ", we shall complete the results obtained in [ i ] by deriving , using the same phenomenological equations , expressions for the intensities which can be measured in the vv and hh scattering geometries ; those are the geometries generally used to study longitudinal phonons .",
    "the results will be completely expressed with the help of the different quantities entering eqs .",
    "( [ constitutive],[qosci ] ) and a generalisation of eq .",
    "( [ epsqonly ] ) which includes density fluctuations .",
    "this second series of results have immediate implications for the experimentalist and they can be derived through elementary algebraic techniques .",
    "the formal proof of the validity of the phenomenological equations and of the conditions under which the spectra are positive requires the use of more elaborate tools . in order to make the present results accessible to as large an audience as possible",
    ", we found it useful to reverse the logical order and to split our presentation into two consecutive papers .",
    "the second one ( part ii ) will give a complete derivation of these equations and of their consequences , only briefly sketched in @xcite , as well as a comparison between the results obtained through the phenomenological approach and through the more abstract technique of @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological part of our work ( part i ) is organised as follows .    in section",
    "ii , we will derive the expressions for the intensity obtained in vv and hh experiments .",
    "section iii will discuss the changes in the line - shape of the longitudinal phonons that can be expected when the coupling of the rotation of the molecules to the longitudinal phonons is taken into account in the expression of the dielectric fluctuation .",
    "finally , a brief summary of these results , a comparison with the expressions previously obtained for the vh intensity [ i ] and additional remarks will be presented in section iv .",
    "in a light scattering experiment , the incident laser may be characterised by the amplitude of the electric field @xmath37 , and its polarization @xmath38 .",
    "the spatial and temporal variation of the electric field @xmath39 is given in terms of the wave vector @xmath40 and the frequency @xmath41 . from the corresponding quantities of the scattered beam , @xmath42 , one obtains insight into the fluctuations of the sample that occur at the scattering vector @xmath43 at the frequency shift @xmath44 .",

    "( [ debye ] ) , and we use the same values of @xmath160 as in @xcite , simply studying also and in more details the @xmath161 regime . the amplitudes are taken as @xmath162 and @xmath163{3/16}$ ] in order to use the same phonon propagator as in @xcite .",
    "since the brillouin peak is at much smaller frequencies than the libration frequency , @xmath31 , the spectra are not sensitive to the value of @xmath164 in the frequency window studied here .",
    "hence , we set @xmath165 , or @xmath166 . finally , one needs a plausible numerical value for the ratio @xmath167 .",
    "its estimate can be obtained from the following considerations .",
    "impulsive stimulated thermal scattering ( ists ) experiments have been performed on supercooled liquids formed of anisotropic molecules such as salol and otp .",
    "it has been recognised recently that the spectral shape of the signal obtained in this pump - probe experiment is sensitive to the polarisation of the probe beam @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the origin of the signal is not the thermal fluctuations of @xmath53 and @xmath34 but the intensity of the pump beam ; conversely , the signal is detected through the dependence of the local dielectric tensor on density and orientation as in a vv experiment .",
    "the ists signal then turns out to be linear in @xmath53 and @xmath34 with the same coefficients as in eq .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) . making use of different polarisations of the probe beam",
    ", the contribution of the two variables can be disentangled @xcite , and a value for a typical molecular liquid , metatoluidine , of the order of @xmath168 can be derived from the results of @xcite . in order to overemphasise the effect of the additional scattering channels ,",
    "we have found it convenient , in the present paper , to choose a value equal to @xmath169 .",
    "all the results presented in this section have been obtained with those numerical values .        *",
    "preliminary remarks    as already alluded in part a of this section , the two regimes @xmath170 and @xmath171 are rather uninteresting from the practical point of view of determining a value of @xmath160 : the most important piece of information is contained in the position of the brillouin peak , its linewidth being much more difficult to analyse because its exact line - shape can not be determined .",
    "the remaining low intensity part of the brillouin line can not be studied experimentally because it can not be disentangled , either from the wing of the central peak ( first term of the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) ) for high temperatures , i.e. @xmath170 , or from a flat background for low temperature , @xmath171 .",
    "let us just mention here that , even in these regimes , at very low frequency , the r.h.s of the second term of eq .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) can lead to a negative contribution to the intensity , due to the existence of the @xmath172 and @xmath122 terms , as was already mentioned for the latter case in @xcite .",
    "this is not an artefact of the theory , eqs .",
    "( [ constitutive],[qosci],[eps ] ) , but a consequence of the introduction of translation - rotation coupling into these equations . if one takes it into account , it is no longer necessary that the @xmath0-dependent part of eq .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) is always positive , the requirement being that only the full r.h.s of this equation is positive .",
    "we shall differ the discussion of this point to section iv and , mostly , to part ii @xcite .",
    "in spite of the preceeding remark on the @xmath173-like shape of those spectra in the two regimes , their study turns out to be instructive , because the way the two additional channels contribute to the spectrum will be similar in the @xmath156 regime we shall study later ; there , one will directly detect their influence on the line - shape while their analytical study is easier in the extreme cases we consider here .",
    "we shall first develop analytic formulae , then demonstrate that these effects do show up in the line - shape of the @xmath174 $ ] and @xmath175 $ ] spectra , if analysed with sufficiently large accuracy , and finally show that , nevertheless , the @xmath0-dependent part of the vv spectrum is little affected by these effects in the two cases , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , in the region of the brillouin peak .",
    "* analytical results    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the numerical values extracted from the best fits , as well as the value of the peak frequency of @xmath176 , @xmath5 , are reported in table ii .",
    "the fits are displayed in fig .",
    "4 and they show that the closer @xmath177 is to unity , the worse is the agreement with the density - only model .",
    "note that the value of @xmath167 has been overestimated to emphasize the effect .",
    "the discrepancy between the fit function and the computed spectra has always the characteristic features discussed before : the fit function has a lower intensity than the computed one above the brillouin peak and a higher one below .",
    "the trends reported in table ii are worth commenting : the ratio @xmath178 increases with longer relaxation times @xmath160 , i.e. lower temperatures : the apparent relaxation time @xmath143 is longer than the original one . in brillouin experiments on supercooled liquids ,",
    "this effect will take place for relaxation times of the order of some nanoseconds , while it can not be identified for much longer relaxation times .",
    "the effect will then be apparent in the region where the curve @xmath179 versus @xmath180 has its maximum curvature for fragile glass forming liquids .",
    "this curvature is the origin of the nonzero value of the vogel - fulcher temperature : an apparent increase of the relaxation times in this time window will decrease this curvature and result in an artificial decrease of the vogel - fulcher temperature .",
    "table ii also exhibits an effect that has not been reported in experimental studies of brillouin spectra of supercooled liquids : a decrease , instead of an increase , of @xmath181 upon cooling @xcite . this contrasts with the familiar trend of @xmath182 which increases with @xmath160 as is shown in table ii .",
    "the unconventional dependence on temperature of @xmath181 may be an artefact of the oversimplified model for the memory kernels .",
    "the present paper aimed at giving complete and transparent expressions for polarised brillouin light scattering experiments within the framework of the phenomenological equations recalled in the introduction .",
    "these equations have been derived through the use of heuristic arguments in [ i ] and a demonstration of their validity has been briefly sketched in @xcite .",
    "their detailed proof will be given in the second paper of this series ( part ii ) , where the same set of relevant variables , i.e mass density @xmath33 , orientation @xmath34 and their respective currents are considered .",
    "the expressions for the intensity in the vv and hh scattering geometry are given by eqs .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) and ( [ ihh ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the spectrum naturally splits into a sum of two terms : one describes the pure orientational dynamics of the molecules , decoupled from density fluctuations ; the second term involves the propagation of longitudinal phonons .",
    "the corresponding longitudinal viscosity comprises contributions from the relaxation of the translational and orientational motions .",
    "the coupling of these two types of motion is characterised by the translation - rotation coupling constant , @xmath32 , and by the frequency - dependent rotation - translation function , @xmath183 , while the orientational dynamics is characterised by @xmath79 which depends very weakly on @xmath48 in the region of interest for brillouin scattering studies .",
    "the role of @xmath32 and @xmath172 in the spectra is twofold : first , their play a role in the phonon propagator and , second , they enter in the detection mechanism via the factor @xmath184 $ ] .    the role of the molecular polarisability anisotropy in detecting both the uncoupled orientational dynamics and the transverse , diffusive or propagative modes with wave vector @xmath60 already appeared in [ i ] . for the sake of completeness , we reproduce here the results obtained in that paper under a from that allows for an easy comparison with eq .",

( [ ivh ] ) of the factor 2/3 is in agreement with a result of @xcite , as will be discussed in part ii .",
    "we studied , in section iii , the change in the spectral line - shape brought by taking into account the additional light scattering channels .",
    "we concentrated on the second term of the r.h.s .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) , mostly discussing the type of distortion produced by these new terms in the spectral shape in the vicinity of the brillouin peak .",
    "let us add some remarks .",
    "firstly , in section iii , the numerical calculation of the total intensity was performed using a positive ratio @xmath188 and we assumed through eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) that @xmath189 could be characterised by some amplitude , @xmath190 , and a smooth , positive , decreasing function of time that approaches zero for long times .",
    "contrary to the coefficient @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) , the numbers @xmath120 and @xmath190 are not always positive , but we want to point out that their product @xmath191 is commonly a positive quantity , for prolate as well as for oblate axial molecules . indeed , on the one hand , the polarisability anisotropy , @xmath120 , is usually positive for prolate molecules giving rise to glass - forming liquids and negative for the oblate ones . on the other hand , the sign of @xmath189 is also shape dependent as can be inferred from the following argument .",
    "subjected to a steady shear flow , @xmath192 , a molecular liquid builds up a nonzero stationary mean orientation @xmath34 which is easily deduced from eq . ( [ qosci ] ) : @xmath193 \\tau_{ij } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if , for instance , this flow is in the @xmath194 direction with a positive gradient in the @xmath195 direction , i.e. @xmath196 , one easily convinces oneself that a long axis of the molecule will be , on average , parallel to @xmath197 , and a short axis parallel to @xmath198 .",
    "hence , cigar - shaped molecules will exhibit @xmath199 , whereas disk - shaped ones lead to @xmath200 . in other words , the shear flow exerts a torque on the molecules so that the sign of : @xmath201 which is also the sign of @xmath190 for a smoothly decreasing function @xmath202 , is the same as the sign of @xmath120 .",
    "secondly , the total vv spectrum is the sum of two terms in eq .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) : the first is proportional to the backscattering vh spectrum and gives always a positive contribution to the intensity for all frequencies .",
    "conversely , at very low frequencies , the second , @xmath0-dependent , term may give rise to a negative contribution .",
    "this is in contrast to the density - only model and may serve as a simple test to determine whether or not translation - orientation coupling is significant .",
    "since the measured spectrum should be positive whatever the frequency , one would like to know if the proposed phenomenological equations ensure this property and , if necessary , what additional requirements have to be imposed on the memory kernels to guarantee this positiveness .",
    "the phenomenological equations allow to derive the appropriate conditions . however , these conditions will appear more naturally and in a transparent way in the microscopic approach .",
    "therefore their derivation will be postponed to part ii and we merely state here the result : the measurable spectra in the three geometries vv , hh , vh , eqs .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) ( [ ihh ] ) and ( [ ivh ] ) , are positive for all frequencies provided that :        this conditions appear as a generalisation of the onsager relations for the dynamics of a coupled system and are , as expected , independent of the @xmath206 ratio .",
    "this corroborates the argument that the positiveness of the spectra should not depend on the relative strength of the two scattering mechanisms . in view of the analytical form of the memory kernels as given in eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) , and with the numerical values used in section iii for @xmath207 and @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ onsager ] ) is fulfilled for all frequencies if @xmath208 .",
    "nevertheless , in the frequency range considered , the role of @xmath164 is important only in the @xmath0-independent part of eq .",
    "( [ ivv ] ) ( rotational part of the spectrum ) : @xmath209 = \\frac{1}{\\omega } i m \\left [   \\frac{\\omega \\gamma'(\\omega ) - \\omega^2}{d(\\omega ) } \\right ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have checked that the neglect of @xmath164 in @xmath79 , both in the denominator of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ imd ] ) and in @xmath172 , has virtually no influence : it does not change the intensity and the shape , either of the pure rotational spectrum , or of the @xmath0-dependent spectrum discussed in section iii .",
    "conversely , this neglect allows for the analytic discussion of @xmath176 performed in that section .",
    "this justifies , a posteriori , the simplification made there .    finally , we already pointed out in the introduction that effects related to energy conservation , in particular to thermal diffusion , are neglected in the present paper .",
    "some consequences of the heat diffusion process are well known since the pioneer work of landau and placzek @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to contributions in the propagator of longitudinal phonons for very low frequencies .",
    "other aspects of the role of temperature fluctuations were taken into account in @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that , if one deals explicitly with the coupling of temperature to dielectric fluctuations , one arrives at a rather complex form of the coupling of detection channels and propagators of these excitations . in order to describe this aspect within a phenomenological approach ,",
    "the constitutive equations of the present paper have to be generalised and supplemented by an equation of motion for the energy conservation , while the detection mechanism , eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) , will remain unchanged .",
    "this paper has benefited from many discussions of one of us ( r.m.p ) with h.z .",
    "cummins on the light scattering mechanisms .",
    "the latter was also instrumental in suggesting the collaboration that lead to the present paper ."
