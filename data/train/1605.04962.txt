    "the dramatic decrease in the cosmic star formation density from @xmath0 to the present day has been well documented ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "conversely , the neutral gas content ( h ) of galaxies spanning the same redshift range is much less well known . at @xmath5 , large area surveys such as the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa , @xcite ) and the h  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass , @xcite , @xcite )",
    "provide direct detections of the cold neutral gas in galaxies , from which the h  density of the local universe can be derived .",
    "targeted studies , such as the blind ultra - deep h  environmental survey ( budhies , @xcite ) , or the highz survey @xcite , have used many hundreds of hours of observing time to detect several galaxies in h  at @xmath6 , but the detected objects are not representative of the general galaxy population , being either located in high density environments , or lying at the upper end of the galaxy mass distribution .",
    "an average measurement of the h  content of galaxies not individually directly detected can be derived from spectral stacking , which has provided estimates of the cosmic hdensity to @xmath7 ( @xcite , and @xcite , for example ) , and can be extended to even higher redshifts .    at high ( @xmath8 ) redshifts , the neutral gas content of galaxies and their environments is detected in absorption along the line - of - sight toward background quasars , resulting in damped ly@xmath9  systems ( dlas ) , lower column density lyman limit systems and the ly@xmath9  forest .",
    "the large numbers of these systems currently known ( several thousands , see @xcite ) gives an indirect measurement of the gas content of galaxies at redshifts beyond the reach of current radio telescopes .",
    "the lower redshift limit of @xmath10 is set by the ly@xmath9  absorption appearing in the ultra - violet , necessitating expensive space - based spectroscopy .",
    "as h  provides the fuel for star formation , a connection between star formation activity and the neutral gas reservoirs available to feed the activity is expected .",
    "an intriguing detail is that while the level of star formation has dropped by more than an order of magnitude from @xmath0 to the local universe , the difference between the hdensity at @xmath11 measured from h  in emission to @xmath8 measured from h  in absorption has only changed by a factor of a few ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the nearly constant h  density since @xmath0 indicates replenishment of the gas reservoir , as the gas consumption timescales are relatively short in comparison .",
    "this discrepancy also points to at least one additional ingredient required to connect the reservoir of fuel to stellar buildup .",
    "molecular gas , as the intermediary between neutral gas and star formation , is an obvious line of investigation .",
    "alma , with its exceptional sensitivity , is revolutionizing the study of molecular gas , both at low and high redshift .    observing h  in emission spanning",
    "the redshift range @xmath12 is within the capabilities of the next generation of radio telescopes , and is one of the key science cases for the square kilometre array ( ska , @xcite ) . in the meantime , existing facilities , including the recently upgraded karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) , and the aperture tile in focus ( apertif ) focal - plane array system planned for deployment on the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in 2016 @xcite , will allow measurement of the h  content of galaxies to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . a deep h  survey , the cosmos h  large extragalactic survey ( chiles ) is indeed already underway with the vla ( see section [ sec : chiles ] ) .    in preparation for the ska ,",
    "mid - frequency pathfinder radio telescopes currently under construction including south africa s meerkat ( @xcite ) and the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap , @xcite ) , will improve on the capabilities of existing facilities .",
    "thus , we will be able to begin exploring the gap in redshift , @xmath12 , corresponding to lookback times up to nearly 8 gyr , which has thus far remained almost entirely inaccessible with respect to the neutral gas content of galaxies .      in practice ,",
    "the amount of time available on a given facility is finite .",
    "performing observations _ commensally _ , i.e. multiple independent projects with distinct science goals all using the data from a single observation , greatly improves the efficiency of a telescope .",
    "clever adjustment of the observational parameters , including integration time , survey area , and frequency resolution , enables maximum scientific return for a given dataset .",
    "we focus here on the commensality between h  and continuum observations , with the aim of optimising the scientific return for the hsurveys , by adjusting only the depths and areas of the observations .",
    "the ability to combine surveys with historically different observation modes , namely spectral line and radio continuum , has only recently become feasible due to expanded bandwidth of receivers and sufficient computing to handle the increased data rates .",
    "previously , observing in spectral line mode was necessarily restricted to a limited frequency range , corresponding to a very narrow volume slice , appropriate for targeted observations .",
    "performing purely commensal continuum observations in spectral line mode was not worth the increased computing overhead , because the probability of the small volume probed containing an h - rich galaxy was low . with the increased bandwidth available for spectral line observations , spanning many hundreds of mhz",
    ", the volume probed for h  detections is vastly increased .",
    "we note that the different computing requirements of spectral line and continuum science , with respect to imaging , spatial and spectral resolution , among other things , will need to be considered",
    ". spatial and spectral resolution can be customized for each science case by implementing this flexibility within the data processing pipeline .",
    "fortunately , the h  and continuum observations have similar initial calibration requirements , so the computing overhead for processing a set of observations to be suitable for both h  and continuum science is minimal .",
    "satisfying the observational requirements of multiple science cases while staying within the boundary conditions of available observing time requires careful planning and preparation .",
    "we should also be mindful of existing and planned ancillary data efforts .",
    "survey area , depth , and particularly relevant for radio observations , spatial resolution , need to be considered . at the depths probed by next generation radio facilities ,",
    "the continuum source density is high @xcite , requiring adequate spatial resolution , of the order of an arcsecond or less , to avoid source confusion .",
    "the h  source density is much lower , and thus confusion is not as problematic .",
    "we also investigate the _ complementarity _ of the resulting data products .",
    "ultra - deep neutral hydrogen surveys are planned with both meerkat ( laduma , @xcite ) and askap ( dingo ) , spending several thousands of hours of observations of single fields to detect h  in galaxies to higher redshifts and lower h  masses than possible with existing telescopes .",
    "these same observations will be used by the radio continuum teams , who intend to create ultra - deep continuum maps using multi - frequency synthesis imaging .",
    "the converse is also true , with h  spectral line data to be extracted from large area continuum observing programmes .",
    "thus , from the same observations , simultaneous h  spectral line and broad - band continuum data can be obtained , probing both the neutral gas reservoirs and star formation activity for a large sample of galaxies spanning a cosmologically significant range in redshift .",
    "this dual - usage of a single dataset to explore two related , yet distinct , physical processes is unique to upcoming radio surveys .",
    "we focus only on surveys using the meerkat pathfinder and the ska phase 1 mid - frequency ( ska1-mid ) instrument .",
    "we have not included proposed apertif or askap surveys , as the final performance of the phased array feeds emerging technology has yet to be conclusively measured .",
    "also , while the single pointing field of view is @xmath1530 deg@xmath16 , the frequency range , and thus redshift range accessible for h , will not be as extensive as that of meerkat or ska1-mid .",
    "the current work has two goals .",
    "the first is to investigate commensal observations , focusing on a combination of surveys soon to begin , in section  [ sec : cases ] .",
    "we then use what we learned from that example to suggest optimal commensality for upcoming ska surveys in section  [ sec : skadesign ] , and focus on parametrization of the h  mass function as a general science goal .",
    "the investigation here serves as input for the ongoing discussion regarding the definition of the surveys to be undertaken with next generation facilities . in the second half of the work , starting in section  [ sec : deepsurveys ] , we focus on how h  spectral line and radio continuum observations are complementary , and what information each provides with respect to the other .",
    "a case study for a pair of surveys currently underway is in section  [ sec : chiles ] .",
    "a summary is in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "concordance cosmology with @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 ( thus @xmath19/[100 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18]@xmath21 ) , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is assumed when computing masses and luminosities , unless noted otherwise .",
    "advances in computing power and engineering technology provide flexibility in observing techniques . in the past",
    ", observations were performed either in spectral line mode , with fine spectral resolution over a limited frequency range , or continuum mode , with coarser spectral resolution over a wider frequency range .",
    "upcoming facilities will have no such restriction , enabling simultaneous spectral line and continuum observations .",
    "while this is clearly efficient with respect to observing time , the science return of the observations can also be increased .",
    "the south african ska precursor facility , meerkat , is a 64-element array of 13.5 m dishes located in the karoo region of south africa .",
    "the smaller dish diameter of meerkat , with respect to the vla , results in a larger field of view ( fov ) , with the primary beam full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of nearly 1 degree at 1420mhz for the former compared to 0.5 degree for the latter .",
    "the majority of operational time has been allocated to several large programmes , with the remaining time available for smaller individual projects .",
    "looking at the distant universe with the meerkat array ( laduma ) , is the deep h  survey to be undertaken with meerkat .",
    "laduma has been allocated 5000 hours of observing time for a single pointing , to be split between two frequency bands , covering @xmath24 for h  ( 1670900 mhz ) in phase 1 operations , and @xmath25 ( 1015580 mhz ) in phase 2 .",
    "the meerkat international giga - hertz tiered extragalactic exploration ( mightee ; @xcite ) survey is the meerkat continuum key science survey , and follows a wedding - cake design .",
    "the exact parameters are yet to be finalised , but for our purposes here , we assume a medium - deep layer covering 35 deg@xmath16 , and a deep @xmath151 deg@xmath16 component coincident with the laduma pointing .",
    "the final area coverage will not change significantly from these values .",
    "the observations allocated to laduma will be made available to the mightee team for continuum science , while the data collected for mightee can be used for h  science , as it will be collected in spectral line mode , with velocity resolution of 26khz , corresponding to 5.5 kms@xmath18  at @xmath11 for h , increasing to 7.8 kms@xmath18  at @xmath26 .",
    "thus , laduma and mightee are to be observed entirely commensally .",
    "the 5000 hours of integration for laduma is sufficient to directly detect the most h - massive systems at @xmath27 and beyond .",
    "this does not , however , directly imply that the continuum data will reach depths corresponding to such long integration times .",
    "the longest planned baseline of the meerkat array is 8 km , resulting in spatial resolution ranging from @xmath156  at 1420mhz to @xmath2815  at 600mhz . using the approximation listed in equation 27 in @xcite to compute the noiseless confusion distribution width @xmath29 , the continuum confusion noise is @xmath151@xmath30jy beam@xmath18 for these resolutions , which is reached in approximately 50 hours with meerkat , and",
    "can not be overcome without introducing longer baselines .    a more significant contribution that laduma data can make to the mightee project",
    "is by providing redshifts for the h - rich , but relatively low stellar mass galaxies at @xmath31 , which will have significant levels of star formation , but are optically faint , and therefore difficult spectroscopic targets at visible wavelengths .",
    "while laduma provides a deep continuum pointing for mightee , mightee provides complementary wide - area h  data with observations covering 35 deg@xmath16 , with tens of hours of integration per pointing .",
    "this is clearly not comparable to the thousands of hours devoted to laduma , but it is sufficient to detect the most massive h  systems , which will be under - represented in the relatively small volume contained within a single pointing .",
    "these same gas - rich galaxies will also have significant star formation , and thus will be a prominent population within the mightee continuum dataset .",
    "we will then have simultaneous measures of the neutral gas content and star formation rates of galaxies extending beyond @xmath5 , including a wide range of environments , as the volume probed is large enough to include a number of massive clusters . the benefits of using the medium - deep continuum survey data to supplement h  surveys is expanded and investigated in the following section .      here we make qualitative predictions of what we can expect from planned surveys and how we can best combine the available information . in the absence of direct observations of the h  content of galaxies at @xmath32",
    ", we rely on information gathered from the low redshift universe , combined with simulations , to estimate the number of galaxies , and their distribution in mass and redshift , upcoming surveys will detect .",
    "we start by investigating the laduma  mightee survey combination , focusing on the h  aspect , as this is where the greatest complementarity is seen .",
    "the confusion issues for the continuum observations make a similar analysis much more complex . for the following , we use the information provided to the public for meerkat . the listed system equivalent flux density ( sefd )",
    "values indicate meerkat s performance is expected to be better than that of the vla , possibly by as much as a factor of two in sensitivity .",
    "as listed in table  [ tab : ska1 ] , for the low redshift ( phase 1 ) component of laduma , the integration time will be 1000 hours , which corresponds to a 5-@xmath33  h  flux limit of 0.015 jy kms@xmath18  for meerkat over 250 kms@xmath18 .",
    "we choose this profile width as we expect the majority of detected objects to be massive systems , with profiles that can easily span several hundreds of kms@xmath18 .",
    "equivalently , for 24 hours per mightee pointing , the 5-@xmath33  h  flux limit is 0.07 jy kms@xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the full 35 deg@xmath16 area will be composed of 35 individual pointings , instead of a single mosaic , which removes the complication of an increasing effective exposure time for a given patch of sky within a mosaic , as the primary beam increases in size going to lower frequency , and hence to higher redshift , and the individual pointings increasingly overlap .",
    "we note , however , that in practice there will be overlap between some of the pointings , thus the calculations here are conservative with respect to the mass detection limit .",
    "we use the parameters from the analytic fits to the @xmath34 relations derived from the simulations of @xcite to convert flux limits in h  to numbers of galaxies detected as a function of redshift .",
    "the simulations are consistent with the observed @xmath11 h  mass function and co(10 ) luminosity function , and allow for evolution of the h  content of galaxies with redshift .",
    "the @xmath34 relations enable us to determine , for a given redshift shell and sky area , the total number of galaxies expected to be detected above a specified flux limit .",
    "appropriate relations for arbitrary integrated flux limits can be obtained by interpolating the function coefficients for the given set of flux limits .",
    "we note that the @xmath34 relations are based on the cosmological parameters of @xmath35 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xcite ) , which have been superceded by , for example , @xcite , but the effect on the results is negligible .",
    "we also make use of the h  mass function ( himf ) derived at @xmath5 from alfalfa @xcite , which spans @xmath39log(@xmath40)@xmath41 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath40@xmath42@xmath3  are exeedingly rare , so we do not include them in our calculations . from the h  mass function",
    ", we can estimate how the galaxies in each redshift shell are distributed in mass .",
    "for the single meerkat pointing of laduma and 35 deg@xmath16 of mightee , we can compute how many galaxies of each mass we expect to observe over the full survey redshift range .",
    "[ fig : lad_mig_zhist ] shows the result of this exercise , limited to @xmath31 .",
    "as seen , the continuum survey , mightee , detects nearly three times as many galaxies in h  as the deep h  survey , laduma , due to the larger area , and thus larger volume , surveyed .",
    "the difference is particularly notable at the high h - mass end , where very few massive h  systems are detected by laduma .     of mightee ( black solid line ) , both for @xmath43 . ]",
    "[ fig : lad_mig_mhi_z ] shows how the detected galaxies counted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lad_mig_zhist ] are distributed in the redshift@xmath40  plane .",
    "the plane is divided into cells of width @xmath44=0.01 and @xmath45log(@xmath40)=0.1 .",
    "the contours for both laduma and mightee are set at 1 , 10 and 25 galaxies per cell .",
    "complications due to spatial resolution determined by the size of the synthesized beam , how this size changes with redshift , and the resulting effect on column density sensitivity have been neglected for this exercise .",
    "the sensitivity is maximized when the size of the galaxy matches the size of the beam , and decreases for larger and smaller sources .",
    "therefore , the lower boundaries of detected galaxies are specifically for galaxies the same size as the beam , and extends to higher masses for galaxies of smaller or larger physical sizes .",
    "the two meerkat surveys are highly complementary , with mightee primarily detecting high h  mass galaxies at low redshift , while laduma reaches further down the h  mass function .",
    "this access to wide area will constrain the high mass end of the h  mass function , which is populated by galaxies with low space density .",
    "the wide area is also essential for studies of galaxy environment and large scale structure , which are inaccessible to the narrow , deep observations .",
    "thus , including h  data from the continuum survey greatly enhances the potential scientific output of the h  studies .",
    "plane for laduma ( red contours , with ` l ' label ) and mightee ( greyscale contours , with ` m ' label ) .",
    "the parameter space is divided into cells of width 0.01 in redshift and 0.1 in log(@xmath40 ) .",
    "the contour levels for both surveys are the same , surrounding regions of parameter space containing at least one ( faint shading ) , 10 ( medium shading ) , and 25 ( dark shading ) galaxies per cell . due to the overlapping frequency coverage of the two meerkat receivers , the redshift range @xmath46",
    "is observed for the full 5000 hours for laduma , and is correspondingly deeper . ]",
    "a tiered , or  wedding - cake \" , survey design , is often employed by large projects , as it provides dynamic range in depth , while also probing a large volume .",
    "the relative depths of the tiers must be set to provide optimal coverage of some parameter of interest .",
    "here we investigate surveys suggested to be undertaken with ska1-mid . the facility will be a combination of 133 15 m new ska dishes , in addition to the 64 13.5 m meerkat dishes , as outlined in the baseline design document version 2 .",
    "as the final telescope will be composed of two types of dishes , each with their own performance characteristics , accurately anticipating the sensitivity of ska1-mid is difficult .",
    "however , given the sefd values provided in the baseline design document for the ska dishes , and those provided in the public meerkat documentation , we conservatively estimate a factor of 5 increase in sensitivity of ska1-mid bands 1 and 2 , with respect to the vla , consistent with simulations by @xcite .",
    "we construct the survey tiers keeping in mind that the resulting data will be used commensally by both the h  and continuum teams , and thus restrict ourselves to the range of parameters that are useful to both .",
    "we use the sensitivity to h  mass as a function of redshift as a measure of the value of the survey tier combination , and optimise the tiers by rearranging their depth and area to maximise coverage of the redshift@xmath40  plane .",
    "the redshift and h  mass distribution of galaxies expected from surveys displayed as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lad_mig_mhi_z ] can be used as a powerful diagnostic tool to explore combinations of depth and area which result in the most scientifically useful dataset .",
    "laduma and mightee are clearly well paired at @xmath31 , enhancing the usefulness of the data .",
    "the ska h  science working group ( swg ) proposed a tiered observing strategy to be undertaken with ska1-mid to address many extragalactic h  science cases , consisting of an ultra - deep , small area survey , a medium - wide , medium - deep survey , and a wide - area , relatively shallow survey .",
    "we refer to these three tiers as ultra - deep ( ud ) , medium - wide ( mw ) and wide ( w ) .",
    "their areas , integration times and approximate 5-@xmath33  sensitivities that can be expected are listed in table  [ tab : ska1 ] as the `` fiducial '' case , as set by @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion within the h  swg of the three tiers will come at a later date , when the technical specifications of the ska1-mid are better known , but the suggested fiducial case serves as a useful starting point .",
    "we have not included the `` strawman '' surveys outlined in the ska h  galaxy evolution chapter ( @xcite ) , as they rely heavily on the ska - survey instrument , construction of which has been deferred .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ska1_proposed1_mhi_z ] the coverage in the redshift@xmath40  plane resulting from the three fiducial h  survey tiers .",
    "increasing the integration time to 4000 hours per tier , to be consistent with the proposed surveys discussed below , improves the sensitivity by a factor of two , but the general features remain unchanged .    a critical aspect missing from the h  swg observing strategy",
    "is the possibility of observing commensally , in particular sharing observations with the ska continuum swg ( @xcite ) . while commensal observing necessarily involves some compromises to be made on some aspects , including field selection , the benefits are significant , including the increased available observing time .",
    "the continuum swg also proposed a three - tiered observing strategy , with areas comparable to those explored here , with a single pointing ud tier , a mw tier spanning 1030 deg@xmath16 , and a w tier of @xmath151000 deg@xmath16 .",
    "the suggested continuum rms values for the three tiers of 0.05 , 0.2 and 1@xmath30jy , respectively , can be compared with the estimated rms values computed for the fiducial and optimised surveys as listed in table  [ tab : ska1 ] .",
    "we do not list continuum rms values for the requested or ideal cases , because the relevant receivers do not currently exist .",
    "we suggest a number of tiered survey strategies working within the framework of commensal extragalactic h  and continuum observations .",
    "the three tiers under consideration are driven by different science cases .",
    "the ud tier is driven primarily by the redshift evolution of h  science case , and has very little flexibility . in order to detect the faintest objects at the greatest distances ,",
    "long integration times are required .",
    "the deepest integration is achieved by observing only a single pointing , the area of which is set by the fov of the telescope . at the other extreme , the w tier is of general use for many science cases .",
    "the size is restricted by the amount of area that can be covered with individual pointings long enough such that they are not dominated by calibration overheads .",
    "the mw tier is intermediate between the two , and requires advance planning to maximise the scientific return .",
    "the area and depth must be simultaneously adjusted such that a representative volume containing detectable galaxies is observed .    for our purposes , we assume in the following that the continuum science will be the primary driver behind the mw tier , as it will provide the bulk of the continuum science return .",
    "the w tier is too shallow to explore a signficant redshift range , while the narrow ud tier will suffer from cosmic variance , which becomes a significant source of uncertainty for areas smaller than about 10 deg@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the ska continuum swg specification that the mw tier should be 1030 deg@xmath16 , while the required sensitivity should be sufficient to sample the peak of star formation , at @xmath47 .",
    "continuum confusion is not an issue for ska1-mid as it is for meerkat and askap , as the array layout will enable sub - arcsecond spatial resolution .",
    "h  science can employ a range of spatial resolutions , matching the resolution with the angular scale of the targets .",
    "we assume that the continuum and h  data processing pipelines will be able to customize the spatial resolution of the respective maps for optimal sensitivity .",

    "the fiducial case is from the ska h  science working group , whereas the optimised case alters the depth and areas of these three tiers .",
    "the requested case reflects the frequency coverage of the suggested revised band 1 and band 2 , while the ideal case is for a hypothetical , single - octave receiver system .",

    "a critical aspect of the following investigation is the frequency coverage of the ska1-mid instrument .",
    "the current design for the mid - frequency receivers is for band 1 to cover 1050350mhz ( corresponding to @xmath50 for h  observations ) , and band 2 1700950mhz ( @xmath51 ) , the extent of which are indicated as vertical dashed lines in fig .  [",

    "current measurements of the receiver indicate it performs slightly better than this at low redshift ( high frequencies ) , with decreasing sensitivity to high redshift ( lower frequencies ) .",
    "alternative possibilities for receiver bands are currently under discussion .",
    "one option that has been suggested is to replace the current wide band 1 with a single - octave band covering 875475mhz ( @xmath53 for h ) , and the low redshift band 2 with a second band covering 1470795mhz ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this arrangement shifts the overlapping redshift range from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "this arrangement is listed as `` requested '' in table  [ tab : ska1 ] .",
    "addtional options involve a single - octave band covering either 1420710mhz ( @xmath12 for h ) , or 1200600mhz ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "although the second range excludes observing h  at @xmath11 , it is an attractive option for a number of reasons .",
    "first , with respect to survey commensality , detailed h  observations of nearby galaxies have different requirements to the deep h  surveys aiming for higher redshift , so it is sensible to perform the @xmath11 and @xmath58 surveys separately .",
    "in addition , there is known severe rfi at 11701300mhz , rendering extracting data from observations within this frequency range very problematic .",
    "continuum studies also stand to benefit , as the lower frequency limit of 600mhz results in a larger fov and enhances sensitivity due to the spectral shape of radio sources , albeit with poorer spatial resolution . including coverage at @xmath59 at the expense of @xmath60 also offers the opportunity to explore new parameter space , which is only accessible to the ska .",
    "the number of galaxies directly detected at such high redshifts will be modest , but we will gain the most new information with such observations .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate three cases for frequency coverage .",

    ", we will , for the first time , be able to trace both the h   reservoir and the star formation activity in the same galaxies over a cosmologically significant timescale , when the sfr is dropping rapidly but the neutral gas content remains relatively stable .",
    "careful planning of commensal observations enables multiple science cases to benefit from the same data , and maximises the scientific return with no impact on telescope time .",
    "the meerkat programmes laduma and mightee are an excellent example of survey tiers well matched in terms of relative depth and area coverage , creating a comprehensive h  dataset .",
    "conversely , the three h  survey tiers suggested by the ska h  science working group to be undertaken with the ska1-mid instrument require significant rearrangement in terms of area and depth to create a coherent dataset .",
    "the definition of the frequency bands is a critical aspect when designing the tiered survey , especially for h  science .",
    "we find that alternative frequency band definitions , either the suggested alteration of bands 1 and 2 , or a new single - octave band covering 1200600mhz , require less extreme survey tiers , and less observing time , in order to optimally cover the redshift@xmath40  parameter space .",
    "in addition to h  and continuum observations being highly commensal , the data products are also complementary .",
    "h  selection results in a galaxy sample biased toward blue , star - forming galaxies , which are the same galaxies that dominate radio continuum selection at faint flux limits .",
    "h  selection also results in a sample less biased in terms of stellar mass than the effective optical flux limit that results from the additional requirement of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "in fact , data from the radio spectral line observations are able to provide redshifts for gas - rich galaxies without needing additional optical spectroscopy .",
    "commensal observing will become more common as new facilities with expanded capabilities come online , and large programmes compete for ever increasing time allocations . maximising the science return for many separate projects while minimising observational effort will be essential to achieve the ambitious goals set out by each team , whose individual survey plans would not be realised otherwise .",
    "the current investigation shows that with adjustments of survey parameters , including area and depth , a coherent strategy satisfying several communities is possible , provided advance effort is committed to the planning stages .",
