    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic bose gases @xcite has stimulated both theoretical as well as experimental efforts to investigate new and interesting physics in ultracold atomic gases .",
    "in particular , it has spurred a lot of interest in achieving a bcs transition in trapped fermionic gases , also because a spin - polarized gas of atomic @xmath1li has theoretically been shown to undergo a transition into a superfluid state at a critical temperature that is comparable to those realized in the experiments with trapped bose gases @xcite .",
    "this relatively high critical temperature is due to it s anomalously large and negative scattering length of @xmath2 a@xmath3 @xcite . to reach the temperature regime where the quantum degeneracy of the atomic gas becomes important ,",
    "evaporative cooling is used .",
    "this technique , however , requires a fast thermalization rate and therefore a high collision frequency . for doubly spin - polarized fermi gases",
    "this is not possible due to the exclusion principle , and such a high collision frequency must be obtained by using a mixture of either fermi - bose gases @xcite or fermi - fermi gases @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this method of sympathetic cooling has already been used to produce the first two - component bose condensate @xcite and has recently also been reported to be succesful for a fermionic two - component @xmath4k mixture @xcite .",
    "mixtures of dilute atomic gases are , however , interesting in their own right , both from an experimental as well as from a theoretical viewpoint .",
    "indeed , experimental work on the static and dynamic properties of a binary mixture of bose gases has included the study of mean - field effects @xcite , relative - phase coherence @xcite , the dynamics of component separation @xcite , and rabi oscillations @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "metastable states @xcite and quantum tunneling effects @xcite have been observed in spinor bose - einstein condensates , and most recently a convenient method for the creation of topological excitations in two - component bose - condensed gases has been suggested @xcite and succesfully carried out experimentally @xcite",
    ". theoretical work on trapped binary bose condensed gases , has for example included the stability and static properties @xcite , the dynamics of the relative phase @xcite and the collective modes @xcite . also for spinor",
    "bose condensates in optical traps , the phase diagram and collective modes have been considered @xcite . in the case of fermi - bose mixtures ,",
    "the density profiles for gases confined in a harmonic trap have been studied at nonzero temperatures in a thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the theory is based on a mean - field treatment of the interactions and neglects the effect of fluctuations .    inspired by the well - known physics of @xmath5he-@xmath6he mixtures @xcite",
    ", we here go beyond mean - field theory and study the effective interaction between two fermions due to density fluctuations in a bose condensate .",
    "in particular , we calculate the resulting effective interatomic @xmath0-wave scattering length for two fermions in different hyperfine states with the aim of manipulating it in such a way that a bcs transition becomes feasible .",
    "the two hyperfine states form an effective spin @xmath7 system , and therefore the mixture of fermions in two different hyperfine states can be treated as a fermi gas with spin @xmath7 .",
    "we mostly take the populations of the two spin levels to be equal because , if a bcs transition can be achieved at all , this will be the optimal situation .",
    "moreover , we also consider the system to be homogeneous , for the following reason : if the mixture would be trapped in an isotropic harmonic potential with trapping frequency @xmath8 , a measure for the overlap of the bose condensate with the fermionic cloud is given by the ratio of the zero - temperature thomas - fermi radii for an interacting bose condensed gas and that of an ideal fermi gas .",
    "the former is equal to @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the harmonic oscillator length , @xmath11 is the bosonic scattering length , and @xmath12 is the number of bosons .",
    "the latter equals @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the number of fermions . for typical experimental parameters and the desirable large numbers of bosonic and fermionic atoms ,",
    "this overlap of the two clouds is rather small .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the effect of the bose condensate on the interaction between the fermions in the mixture , we consider only a spatially homogenous system .",
    "although all the experiments with bose condensed gases have been performed with harmonic oscillator traps up to now , this is not an unrealistic suggestion since it is certainly possible to create an external trapping potential that is more or less a rectangular box @xcite .",
    "physically , the effect of the bose condensate on the fermion - fermion interaction is due to the exchange of phonons that propagate in the bose - condensed gas . in order to calculate the effect on the interatomic interaction quantitatively , we thus , have to accurately know the density - density correlation function in the bose gas .",
    "this is straightforward in the bogoliubov approximation , whose validity is well - established at such low temperatures that the bose gas is essentially fully condensed . in this manner",
    "we obtain the actual interaction potential from which we then extract the interatomic scattering length .",
    "in addition to the effective fermion - fermion interaction , we consider the important question of the stability of the three - component system against demixing of the various bose and fermi components of the gas .",
    "we also calculate the excitation spectrum for the fermi - bose mixture far below the bose - einstein transition temperature , where the dynamics of the gas is in the collisionless regime .",
    "theoretically , this amounts to doing a so - called rpa ( random phase approximation ) calculation for this mixture . as a result",
    "we find not only the eigenmodes of the gas , but also the landau damping of these modes due to the imaginary part of the ` rpa - bubble ' diagram .",
    "note that from a fundamental point of view the stability and the excitation spectrum are strongly related , because a signature of the demixing - instability is the occurrence of a mode with a purely imaginary frequency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] we first calculate the effective interaction and scattering length of two fermions in the presence of a bose condensate .",
    "in particular , we show that for realistic conditions , the scattering length strongly depends on the collision energy of the atoms , which is important when considering the prospects of a bcs transition in a spin - polarized potassium gas . in sec .",
    "[ sec2b ] we then consider the stability of the three - component system and show that in general this does not lead to very stringent constraints on the densities . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec2c ] , we calculate the long - wavelength collective mode spectrum and damping for the fermi - bose mixture .",
    "we end with a summary in sec .",
    "[ sec2d ] .",
    "in this section , we calculate the effective interaction and scattering length of two fermions . the calculation is performed by means of functional methods @xcite , because even in the presence of a bose condensate , the rpa calculation for the collective modes can then be performed in a purely algebraic manner in sec .",
    "[ sec2c ] and avoids the complications of an explicit evaluation of feynman diagrams .",
    "moreover , it gives some more insight in the physical nature of the collisionless collective modes .",
    "of course , it is also possible to do the same calculation in the operator formalism .",
    "if performed correctly , it gives identical results .      in accordance with the previous remarks ,",
    "we thus start from the functional - integral expression for the grand - canonical partition function of the mixture .",
    "it reads @xmath15d[\\phi]d[\\psi^{*}]d[\\psi ] \\exp \\left\\ { - { 1 \\over \\hbar } { \\big ( }   s_{b}[\\phi^{*},\\phi ] + s_{f}[\\psi^{*},\\psi ] +   s_{i}[\\phi^{*},\\phi,\\psi^{*},\\psi ] { \\big ) } \\right\\ } \\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and consists of an integration over a complex field @xmath16 , which is periodic on the imaginary - time interval @xmath17 $ ] , and over the grassmann fields @xmath18 , which are antiperiodic on this interval .",

    "finally , the masses of the bosonic atoms and the fermionic atoms are denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the reduced mass is denoted by @xmath31 .",

    "the phonon - exchange mechanism thus also induces an interaction between fermions with the same spins .",
    "due to the pauli - principle , however , this interaction can again at best be of a @xmath53-wave nature , and is in general negligible . as a result ,",
    "we from now on only consider the contributions to the interaction potential between particles with opposite spin .",
    "we also neglect the frequency dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , and consider only the static contribution .",
    "this implies that the relevant collision energies of the fermions must be much less than the bosonic mean - field interaction .",
    "the resulting instantaneous potential is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 here we have defined the coherence length @xmath56 in the bose - condensed gas .",
    "the effective potential depends on three parameters , the cutoff @xmath57 , the coherence length @xmath58 and @xmath59 . as we will show now",
    ", however , there is a separation of length scales , and @xmath60 is in general much smaller than the other relevant length scale , the coherence length @xmath58 .",
    "this means that we can safely ignore the cutoff and take the limit @xmath61 . to estimate the magnitude of the cutoff , we make use of the fact that it is determined by the requirement that the bare interatomic interaction has renormalized to the two - body scattering matrix .",
    "this renormalization of the bare interaction is described by the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath62 here @xmath63 denotes the ultra - violet cutoff provided by the interatomic potential , and @xmath57 is the momentum scale up to which fluctuations in the bose gas are integrated over .",
    "the bare interaction @xmath64 is chosen such , that in the limit @xmath65 the result does not depend on the high - momentum cutoff @xmath63 @xcite . requiring the renormalized interaction to be within approximately a fraction @xmath66 from the two - body transition matrix leads to @xmath67 if we compare this value for the cutoff with the coherence length @xmath58 , the product of the two is given by @xmath68 due to the presence of the factor @xmath69 in the denominator , this quantity is in general much larger than @xmath70 , and we can safely take the limit @xmath61 . the effective interaction in this case becomes simply @xmath71 and has the form of a purely attractive yukawa potential .      with this interaction potential @xmath72 , we want to determine the effective _ s_-wave scattering length @xmath73 for two fermions interacting also through the mechanism of phonon exchange .",
    "we can associate an _",
    "s_-wave scattering length @xmath74 with the effective interaction @xmath72 as follows @xmath75 here @xmath76 denotes the phase shift of the partial wave with angular momentum @xmath77 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath76 is defined in terms of the asymptotic form @xmath78 for the @xmath77 partial wave @xmath79 , that can be calculated from the radial schrdinger equation @xmath80 at this point , we have to keep in mind that there is already a scattering length @xmath81 for the fermions due to the interatomic potential .",
    "we can take this interatomic scattering length into account by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the partial wave @xmath79 , such that we recover @xmath81 if the interaction due to phonon exchange vanishes , i.e. , if @xmath82 .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed are such that the derivative and the magnitude of the wave function at @xmath83 are equal to those of the function @xmath84 $ ] . in the case of a positive scattering length ,",
    "an alternative procedure would be to add a hard - core potential with a range @xmath81 to @xmath72 .",
    "both these procedures are justified because the range of the interatomic potential is much smaller than the range of the effective potential , and we have checked that numerically they indeed yield the same results .",

    "the various lines corresponds to different values of the condensate density .",
    "it is clear from these figures that for a given mixture , the phase shifts as a function of momentum asymptotically all have the same slope independent of the value of the condensate density .",
    "this slope corresponds to the interatomic scattering length @xmath93 .",
    "however , at long wavelengths the phase shifts can be significantly different from the asymptotic limit , and can depend strongly on the collisional energy . for a mixture of @xmath4k-@xmath86rb",
    "this is certainly the case .",
    "the effective interaction can even become attractive , instead of repulsive , around the fermi momentum , which opens the possibility for a bcs transition to a superfluid phase just like the exchange of phonons in the lattice leads to superconductivity in metals @xcite .",
    "for a mixture of @xmath85li-@xmath86rb the effects are less pronounced , and amount to a slight enhancement of the already very large and negative scattering length .",
    "the case of @xmath4k-@xmath90k may be exciting , because of the possibility of a rather large scattering length for @xmath4k-@xmath90k collisions , which can be of the order of @xmath92 a@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if this value is correct , there are resonances in the effective scattering length as shown in fig .",
    "this strongly resembles the existence of feshbach resonances in the scattering length as a function of the applied bias magnetic field @xcite .",
    "to be able to interact , the bose and the two - component fermi gases have to be overlapping .",
    "therefore , we want to consider the stability of the gas against demixing of the fermi and bose components . to determine the stability of the mixture , we consider the matrix of second - order derivatives with respect to the densities of the free energy @xmath94 , which consists of a fermion term @xmath95 , a boson term @xmath96 and an interaction term @xmath97 . for the mixture to be stable we have to require that all eigenvalues of this matrix are larger than zero , i.e. , that the free - energy surface is convex . at the low temperatures of interest to us ,",
    "the free - energy density is equal to the average energy density @xmath98 and we get    @xmath99    here , the first term is the kinetic energy of the two - component fermi gas , the second and third terms are the interaction energies of the individual fermi and the bose gases , respectively , and the fourth term is due to the interaction between these gases . we have neglected the kinetic energy of the bose gas because of the low temperatures and densities .",
    "note that the effective fermion - fermion t - matrix element @xmath100 has to be used , that includes the effect of phonon exchange .",
    "this is the case because , as long as the fermi energy is much less than the average mean - field energy of the bose condensate , we have to include the effect of fluctuations , which change the static properties of the mixture by renormalizing the fermion - fermion interaction as we have just discussed .",
    "the matrix of second - order derivatives is given by @xmath101 assuming that we start in the stable part of the phase diagram , the onset of an instability is signaled by the point where its determinant becomes equal to zero .",
    "therefore , requiring the determinant of this matrix to be larger than zero is a sufficient condition for stability .",

    "a more involved treatment is necessary , also because the phaseshift is then very strongly momentum dependent .    the surface in the @xmath106 volume where the equality sign holds",
    "is called the spinodal surface .",
    "the spinodal surface divides the phase space into a region where the mixture is ( meta)stable , and one where it is unstable and separates into distinct phases in the stable part of the phase space .",
