    "prospects of creating a quark - gluon plasma in the laboratory and interest in the role of such a plasma in the early universe and in dense stars have stimulated efforts to understand the plasma / ordinary matter phase transition starting from first principles in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is widely suspected that the phase transition occurs at high density as well as at high temperature .",
    "while much progress has been made in characterizing the phase transition at high temperature at zero average baryon density in full qcd , the same degree of success has not been achievable at nonzero density , chiefly because the standard su(3 ) lattice action becomes complex , invalidating standard monte carlo methods .",
    "simulations must then be carried out with related ensembles of real , positive weight .",
    "studies on small volumes offer intriguing hints about the phase structure at nonzero density . but with the wrong ensemble , the thermodynamic limit can not be taken , so the phase structure can not be ascertained @xcite .",
    "thus we turn to simple statistical models for insight .",
    "the three - dimensional three - state potts model is one of the standard paradigms for lattice qcd in the strong - coupling , high - temperature , large - quark - mass limit @xcite .",
    "it has been used to provide qualitative information about the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "past potts model studies have been limited to simulations at zero quark chemical potential and to mean - field studies at nonzero chemical potential . in this work",
    "we show that the potts model can be extended easily to nonzero baryon chemical potential , permitting direct simulation using standard techniques .",
    "the qcd phase transition changes character as the quark masses and flavors are varied . at zero quark mass with two or more flavors",
    "the transition restores the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite . at infinite quark mass it leads to `` deconfinement '' in the pure yang - mills theory .",
    "simulations of full qcd with two flavors at zero chemical potential show that these two regimes are separated at intermediate quark mass by a region where no phase transition occurs  only a strong crossover . in the corresponding potts model",
    "we find this obliteration of the deconfinement transition , not only as the quark mass is lowered , but also as the chemical potential is increased .",
    "the former is found from direct simulation , but the latter is known until now only in mean field theory @xcite . here",
    "we confirm the mean field prediction with a direct simulation .    because the potts model analogy works only in the large quark mass limit",
    ", we learn only the fate of the deconfinement transition and not the chiral transition .",
    "nonetheless , to the extent that a strong crossover in qcd , observed in the intermediate quark - mass regime , is a vestige of deconfinement , one may speculate that a weakening of the qcd crossover at nonzero chemical potential is then indicated .    in the following section we describe the model . in sec .",
    "3 we present results of a simulation . a summary and discussion is offered in the final section .",
    "we use a variant of the flux tube model of patel @xcite also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the model describes a classical statistical system with no dynamics , consisting of a three - dimensional cubic lattice with quarks and antiquarks occupying the sites and color flux tubes occupying the nearest - neighbor links .",
    "a configuration is characterized by the quark number distribution @xmath0 $ ] and the color flux @xmath1 $ ] for each lattice site @xmath2 and associated links in the @xmath3 directions . for convenience links entering a site from a negative direction are denoted alternatively by @xmath4 .",
    "gauss s law is enforced in modulo 3 arithmetic : @xmath5 the hamiltonian assigns a mass @xmath6 to each quark and flux link energy @xmath7 to each link : @xmath8 the grand canonical partition function at inverse temperature @xmath9 and quark chemical potential @xmath10 is then @xmath11   \\label{eq : zf}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and the prime indicates that the sum is over all configurations satisfying gauss s law .    the model is strictly static .",
    "the lowest vacuum excitations consist of mesons built from a quark - antiquark pair separated by one flux link and baryons consisting of three quarks on a site .",
    "further excitations lead to extended baryons and mesons and more complex hadrons , always of zero triality .",
    "( we limited quark occupation to a maximum of three per site , but do not expect qualitative changes in our results if we increase this limit . )    the flux tube model is equivalent to the three - state three - dimensional potts model with complex magnetic field .",
    "that is , @xmath13 , where the potts model partition function is @xmath14 this is the form of the potts model found from the high - temperature , high - quark - mass , strong - coupling limit of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the equivalence is established by a change of basis .",
    "the derivation starts by replacing the gauss s law constraint at each site by a kronecker delta in mod 3 : @xmath15 when we introduce one such sum for each site in the lattice , the sums over link and site occupation numbers decouple and can be summed explicitly .",
    "the @xmath16 constraint variables @xmath17 become the `` clock '' spins of the potts model .",
    "after rearranging the sums we have @xmath18            z_r^{-n_r}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sums under the product symbols are explicitly @xmath19 where @xmath20 \\",
    "\\ \\mbox{and } \\ \\ \\ v = \\exp[-\\beta(m - \\mu)].\\ ] ] with the aid of an identity over @xmath16 these factors can be rewritten in exponential form .",
    "the identity we need is @xmath21 where @xmath22 applying this identity to the first factor ( [ eq : factor1 ] ) gives the relation between the potts spin coupling and the string energy ( in units of the respective temperatures ) @xmath23 and to the second factor ( [ eq : factor2 ] ) , gives the relation between the potts magnetic fields and the quark mass and chemical potential @xmath24 where @xmath25 notice that @xmath26 is odd in @xmath10 and @xmath27 is even . at zero chemical potential",
    "the imaginary coupling vanishes ( @xmath28 ) and at infinite quark mass the real field @xmath27 also vanishes . in this limit",
    "the potts model exhibits the well known first order transition at a value @xmath29 , known from numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "here we have the potts / flux - tube parameter equivalence @xmath30 numerical simulation has indicated that the first order transition persists to a small real magnetic field @xcite . the critical endpoint is crudely known to be in the range @xmath31 $ ] for which @xmath32 , \\beta^\\prime h^\\prime = 0 )   \\equiv   ( \\beta \\sigma = 1.632 , \\beta m = [ 3.2,4.2 ] , \\beta \\mu = 0 ) .\\ ] ] any mass @xmath6 higher than this critical value should admit a first order phase transition .",
    "we chose to simulate the flux tube model at quark mass @xmath33 .",
    "this value was selected to assure a first order phase transition at zero chemical potential .",
    "figure  [ fig : potts_map_z_mu ] shows the mapping from flux tube @xmath34 to potts parameters at zero chemical potential .",
    "we then repeated the simulation at nonzero chemical potential @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potts_map_nz_mu ] .",
    "the potts magnetic fields remain small .",
    "we carry out a simulation in the occupation number basis ( [ eq : zf ] ) , _ i.e. _ the flux tube formulation , in which the boltzmann weights are real and positive and the simulation can be done easily using conventional metropolis methods .",
    "we have chosen an elementary set of metropolis moves that preserve the gauss s law constraint , and are capable of reaching any valid configuration .",
    "the local moves consist of systematically `` adding '' or `` subtracting '' one of four elementary color - singlet hadrons at all locations and orientations in the configuration . a single sweep of the lattice consists of considering each of these moves for all orientations of the hadrons at each lattice site in typewriter order .    the metropolis - move hadrons are these : ( 1 ) a quark and antiquark separated by one flux link , ( 2 ) a diquark and antidiquark separated by one flux link , ( 3 ) a quark and diquark or antiquark and antidiquark , also separated by one flux link , ( 4 ) and a plaquette of flux links . the process of adding ( or subtracting ) a hadron consists of increasing or decreasing the quark occupation number and flux link value of the configuration in mod 3 arithmetic according to the position and orientation of the hadron selected , respecting our exclusion principle that limits the quark number to the range @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "by always adding or subtracting a color singlet state , gauss s law is always obeyed .",
    "while all configurations satisfying gauss s law can be reached by a combination of these moves , this over - complete set was also chosen in an effort to cover the phase space efficiently .",
    "still , we have only a local algorithm , presumably as effective as a local algorithm in the spin basis . for the moment we have not considered cluster algorithms analogous to those that have been so successful in spin systems @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned we simulate at fixed quark mass @xmath33 and choose two values of the chemical potential , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we then vary @xmath39 to locate the phase transition or crossover .",
    "we expect to reproduce the potts first order phase transition at zero chemical potential and small real field , but at nonzero chemical potential we explore new territory .",
    "we simulate at a series of volumes @xmath40 for @xmath41 in each case . in the crossover region",
    "we extend the simulations for , typically , 35,000 to 60,000 metropolis sweeps .",
    "as expected at zero chemical potential , we find a sharp rise in energy density at @xmath42 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_z_mu ] . to characterize the phase transition we study the size dependence of the peak in specific heat @xcite .",
    "the specific heat is defined in the usual way in terms of the total energy @xmath43 of the configuration : @xmath44 figure  [ fig : spheat_z_mu ] shows a peak in the specific heat at zero chemical potential that sharpens and grows with increasing volume .",
    "also shown in these figures are results of a fit to a phenomenological form for a first order phase transition based on a simplification of the finite size analysis of borgs _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite : @xmath45}.\\ ] ] the simplification assumes that the probability distribution for the energy density near the phase transition receives a delta function contribution from the two phases with the usual boltzmann weights : @xmath46 in terms of the energy and entropy in the ordered and disordered phases .",
    "this model gives @xmath47 for @xmath48 , the latent heat of the transition .",
    "in fact the actual probability distribution resembles a sum of broad peaks , but since we are concerned only with extracting @xmath49 , it suits our purpose .",
    "although there are really only two independent parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we have kept the height , width , and center unconstrained and look for evidence for scaling with @xmath40 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheatmax_z_mu ] we plot the specific heat maximum _ vs _",
    "@xmath40 and show that a linear relationship is plausible for @xmath52 .",
    "errors are obtained using a bootstrap method , averaging simulation results in blocks , and extrapolating to infinite block size .",
    "departures from linearity for smaller @xmath53 are well known in this model and arise from finite size effects .",
    "we take the approximate scaling of the peak in specific heat as good evidence for a first order phase transition .",
    "the quark number susceptibility ( three quarks = one baryon ) , defined as @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the total baryon number , rises as the temperature is increased past the phase transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barsusc_z_mu ] .",
    "having tested the method , we turn to nonzero chemical potential .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_nz_mu ] is a plot of the energy density _ vs",
    "_ @xmath34 .",
    "we see evidence for a weak crossover .",
    "notice that here and in the remaining figures , we have enlarged the @xmath34 scale compared with the corresponding zero chemical potential figures .",
    "thus the crossover is far less abrupt than at zero chemical potential . the corresponding specific heat is shown in fig .  [ fig : spheat_nz_mu ] .",
    "there is a diffuse peak in specific heat , but we see no evidence that the peak height is changing with increasing volume .",
    "the peak height is considerably smaller than at zero chemical potential , consistent with a broadening of the crossover .",
    "thus we find no evidence of a phase transition at this chemical potential and quark mass .",
    "we turn to the quark number density and susceptibility .",
    "figure [ fig : bardens_nz_mu ] shows the quark number density as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "we note that in the high temperature range , the quark number density at our chosen mass is quite low ",
    "namely , only a few per thousand sites .",
    "the density rises as temperature is increased past the crossover . as with the energy density , with the exception of the @xmath56 volume ,",
    "we see no evidence for a sharpening of the crossover with increasing volume .",
    "the quark number susceptibility also shows no apparent trend with increasing volume , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barsusc_nz_mu ] .",
    "we have extended the equivalence between the qcd - like flux tube model and potts model to nonzero chemical potential , making possible a direct numerical simulation using standard monte carlo methods , where only mean field methods have previously succeeded .",
    "we have developed numerical evidence that confirms the predictions of mean field theory , namely that the deconfining phase transition disappears if the baryon density is slightly nonzero . while our results are not applicable in the most interesting limit of small quark mass , one may speculate , nonetheless , that they indicate a weakening of the crossover at high baryon number density .",
    "a recent study by blum , hetrick and toussaint analyzes the static limit of qcd and arrives at a similar conclusion concerning the fate of the deconfining phase transition at high density @xcite .",
    "their resulting static action is quite similar to the potts model action with imaginary magnetic field , so their method is also limited to small volumes in a direct monte carlo simulation . to obtain the comparable limit in the flux tube model , one takes @xmath57 with @xmath58 fixed . with only two variables , namely @xmath34 and @xmath59 , one obtains a two - dimensional subspace of the potts parameter space @xmath60 . for large @xmath61 one has @xmath62 , where the first order deconfining transition occurs , whereas at small @xmath61 one explores the region of large @xmath63 and large @xmath64 . in this way",
    "the results can be compared .    in the corresponding canonical - ensemble study in the static limit of qcd , a weakening of the crossover signal is also found at nonzero baryon number @xcite .",
    "however , the authors interpret their results as suggesting the coexistence of two phases in the transition region .",
    "could a similar change of basis also render full qcd simulations tractable at nonzero chemical potential ? normally the qcd path integral is formulated on a basis in which the vector potential is diagonal and the fermion integration is completed explicitly .",
    "the analogous change of basis diagonalizes the color electric flux and treats fermions in the fock space basis , summing over states that are color singlets in quark and gluon content . at finite @xmath65",
    "it appears that the complexities of enforcing color neutrality in such a basis are prohibitive .",
