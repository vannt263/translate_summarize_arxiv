    "the main parameters that characterize any quantum resonance , are the collision energy @xmath3 , at which this state can be excited , and the width @xmath4 that determines the lifetime of the state . for a multi - channel system",
    "the total width is the sum of the partial widths , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 gives the relative probability of decaying into the @xmath7-th channel .",
    "there are many different methods for determining these parameters from a set of scattering data ( several of them are described in refs .",
    "these methods form two big groups based on two principally different approaches . + within one approach ,",
    "the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc are treated as the adjustable variables in a procedure of fitting the available experimental data .",
    "the simplest and most well - known example of such a method is the breit - wigner parametrization of the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all of the methods belonging to this category , is that the number of resonances is fixed from the outset .",
    "all these methods use some parametric expression for the amplitude , or for the @xmath0-matrix , or directly for the cross section , where the resonance singularities ( or the zigzags of the cross section ) are embedded into this parametric expression by hand .",
    "these methods only differ in the method of parametrization and in the derivation of the parametric expression .",
    "+ within the second approach , the resonances are considered as the poles of the @xmath0-matrix at the complex energies @xmath10 in an appropriate domain of the riemann surface of the energy .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is written in a more general form with some adjustable parameters that do not necessarily coincide with the resonance parameters .",
    "usually , it is not known beforehand how many resonances can be found ( if any ) . after fitting the data at real collision energies , the analytic expression for the @xmath0-matrix thus obtained ,",
    "is examined at complex energies where the poles ( if found ) are interpreted as the resonances .",
    "the pad approximation of the @xmath0-matrix  @xcite and the laurent - pietarinen series expansion of the amplitude  @xcite can be mentioned as examples .",
    "+ the method we describe here belongs to the second category and is based on the rigorous semi - analytic expression for the @xmath11-channel jost matrix derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that expression , all the factors responsible for the `` bad behaviour '' of the jost matrix ( i.e. factors depending on the sommerfeld parameters and the channel momenta responsible for the branching of the riemann surface ) are given explicitly .",
    "the remaining unknown factors are analytic and single - valued functions of @xmath1 defined on a simple energy plane .",
    "these functions are expanded in the taylor series , and the expansion coefficients serve as the fitting parameters .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that for a non - relativistic reaction of the type @xmath12 involving charged particles , the @xmath11-channel jost matrix has the following general form : @xmath13 \\nonumber     & - &     \\left.\\left [     \\frac{2\\eta_mh(\\eta_m)}{c_0",
    "^ 2(\\eta_m)}\\pm i\\right ]     c_{\\ell_m}(\\eta_m)c_{\\ell_n}(\\eta_n )     k_m^{\\ell_m}k_n^{\\ell_n+1}{b}_{mn}(e)\\right\\}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the channel momenta determined by the differences between the total energy @xmath1 and the channel thresholds @xmath15 , as well as by the corresponding reduced masses @xmath16 ; the channel angular momenta and the sommerfeld parameters are @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; the function @xmath19 is the coulomb barrier factor ; and @xmath20-\\ln \\hat{\\eta}\\ ,     \\qquad     \\psi(z)=\\frac{\\gamma'(z)}{\\gamma(z)}\\ ,     \\qquad     \\hat{\\eta}=\\frac{\\mu e^2|z_1z_2|}{k\\hbar^2}\\ .\\ ] ] it was shown that the remaining unknown matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ multi.matrixelements ] ) are single - valued and analytic functions of the energy , defined on a simple energy plane without branching points .",
    "all the complicated topology of the riemann surface where the jost functions are defined , is determined by the coefficients of the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 , given in eq .",
    "( [ multi.matrixelements ] ) explicitly .",
    "+ if for a given energy @xmath1 the jost matrices ( [ multi.matrixelements ] ) are known , then the corresponding @xmath0-matrix is just their `` ratio '' , @xmath23^{-1}\\ , \\ ] ] and the scattering cross section for the channel @xmath24 can be found as @xmath25 the resonances are the points @xmath26 on the riemann surface of the energy , where @xmath27 and therefore where the @xmath0-matrix has poles .",
    "+ the energy surface has a square - root branching point at every channel threshold @xmath15 .",
    "this is because the jost matrices depend on the energy @xmath1 via the channel momenta ( [ chmom ] ) and for each of them there are two possible choices of the sign in front of the square root .",
    "the resonance spectral points are located on the so called non - physical sheet of this riemann surface , i.e. such a layer of the surface where all the channel momenta have negative imaginary parts . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "the choice of the sheet is done by an appropriate choice of the signs in front of the square roots ( [ chmom ] ) .",
    "+ since the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are analytic , they can be expanded in the taylor series around any complex point @xmath2 . near this point",
    ", they can therefore be approximated by the first @xmath28 terms of these series : @xmath29 \\label{b_series }     b(e ) & \\approx &     \\sum_{i=0}^m b_i(e_0)(e - e_0)^i\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expansion coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are ( @xmath32)-matrices .",
    "these matrices depend only on the choice of the point @xmath2 . after finding them , the jost matrices ( [ multi.matrixelements ] )",
    "can be used at any complex energy @xmath1 within a circle around @xmath2 where the approximations ( [ a_series ] , [ b_series ] ) are satisfactory . + we treat the elements of the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the adjustable parameters in the procedure of fitting experimental cross section .",
    "after finding the optimal values for them , we look for the roots of eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) and thus find the resonance parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as to the partial widths @xmath33 , they can easily be found following the procedure described in ref .",
    "indeed , we know their sum @xmath34 and we can find their ratios ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath35 at a resonance energy , @xmath36 , all the elements of the @xmath0-matrix are singular because all of them have the same singular factor @xmath37 .",
    "however , in the ratio ( [ ggratio ] ) this factor cancels out .",
    "therefore , if we explicitly invert the matrix @xmath38 and use it in eq .",
    "( [ s_matrix ] ) without common factor @xmath39 , then we can avoid numerical evaluation of the limit ( [ ggratio ] ) . in the simplest case of a two - channel problem ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath40 it should be noted that such a simple and numerically stable procedure for calculating the partial widths is only possible when the jost matrices are parametrized .",
    "if we were parametrizing the @xmath0-matrix directly , then the limits ( [ ggratio ] ) would have to be calculated numerically as the ratios of singular functions .",
    "we assume that there are sets of experimental data available for at least one channel @xmath24 ( or perhaps for several channels ) , i.e. the cross sections @xmath41 with the corresponding experimental errors ( standard deviations ) @xmath42 , measured at the collision energies @xmath43 .",
    "the center @xmath2 of the expansions ( [ a_series ] , [ b_series ] ) can be chosen somewhere within the interval covered by these collision energies ( where we expect to find a resonance ) .",
    "the optimal values of the expansion parameters are found by minimizing the following @xmath44 function @xmath45 ^ 2\\\\[3 mm ] \\nonumber     & + &     \\displaystyle     \\sum_{j=1}^{n^{(m'n')}}\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_{m'n'}(e^{(m'n')}_j)-     \\sigma^{\\mathrm{fit}}_{m'n'}(e^{(m'n')}_j ) }     { \\delta^{(m'n')}_j}\\right]^2     \\ + \\ \\cdots\\\\[3 mm ] \\nonumber     & + &     \\displaystyle     \\sum_{m < n , j}\\left|s_{mn}(e^{(mn)}_j)-s_{nm}(e^{(mn)}_j)\\right|^2\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fitting cross section @xmath46 depends on the expansion coefficients via eqs .",
    "( [ cross_section_sigma_nm ] ) , ( [ s_matrix ] ) and ( [ multi.matrixelements ] ) .",
    "the last sum in the above @xmath44 function makes the fitted @xmath0-matrix symmetric in accordance with the detailed balance theorem ( see a more detailed discussion in ref .",
    "the minimization is done using the minuit code  @xcite .",
    "+ the number of the adjustable parameters depends on the number @xmath11 of the existing channels ( the data do not have to be available for all of them ) and on the number @xmath28 of the terms in the taylor series ( [ a_series ] , [ b_series ] )",
    ". generally speaking , the expansion coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the @xmath32 matrices of complex elements .",
    "however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , they become real matrices if the point @xmath2 is on the real axis . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath2 is on the interval covered by the experimental energies @xmath43 , the the total number of real fitting parameters is @xmath49 .",
    "in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method , we choose a model two - channel problem where the parameters of the resonances can be determined in an exact way . for this model ,",
    "we generate artificial data points with a typical distribution of errors .",
    "in addition to the error - bar for each pseudo - data point , we introduce a random shift ( up or down ) from the exact cross section curve , i.e. a typical experimental `` noise '' . using these points , we extract the resonance parameters and compare them with the corresponding exact values . + our artificial data points are generated using the following two - channel potential having a coulomb tail : @xmath50 the short - range term in this potential is the same as in the famous noro - taylor model  @xcite . the units in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) are therefore the same , namely , they are such that the reduced masses for both channels are equal to one , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , and both angular momenta are zero , @xmath53 .",
    "the threshold energies for the channels are @xmath54 and @xmath55 . +    .the resonance energies and widths generated by the potential ( [ pot ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the main idea of the proposed method has its roots in the so called `` effective - range expansion '' widely used in nuclear and atomic physics ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within this approach",
    ", a certain function of the scattering phase - shift is expanded in the power series of the collision energy , and the expansion coefficients are used as the adjustable parameters to fit experimental data .",
    "traditional effective - range expansion is very useful but is limited to low energies .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to apply it to multi - channel processes .",
    "+ we generalize this approach and thus remove all these limitations .",
    "first of all , we expand a more fundamental quantity : the jost matrix .",
    "when the jost - matrix expansion in the power series is obtained , one can easily derive the corresponding expansion of the @xmath0-matrix , the phase - shift , or any other quantity that is needed .",
    "secondly , it is not necessary to do the expansion near the point @xmath56 .",
    "actually , the expansion can be done around any complex value of variable @xmath1 . concerning the multi - channel problems , for the jost - matrices",
    ", this does not pose any difficulty .",
    "simply , the expansion coefficients become matrices . + in order to expand a function in the taylor series of @xmath1 , one has to be sure that this function is an analytic and single - valued function of @xmath1",
    ". however , all the quantities describing the scattering processes ( amplitude , @xmath0-matrix , jost matrix , etc ) are multi - valued functions defined on a complicated riemann surface of the energy with the number of branch points equal to the number of channels . in order to circumvent this difficulty , we use",
    "earlier derived general semi - analytic expression for a multi - channel jost matrix , where all the factors responsible for its `` bad behaviour '' , are given explicitly .",
    "the remaining unknown functions are more simple , more smooth , and ( more importantly ) are analytic and single - valued functions defined on a simple energy plane .",
    "we only do the expansion for these functions .",
    "+ in our earlier publication @xcite , we demonstrated how the proposed method works for the reactions involving neutral particles . in the present paper",
    ", we consider a more general case when the potential has both a short - range part and a coulomb tail .",
    "similarly to the simple effective - range theory , presence of the coulomb potential makes the explicit coefficients in the semi - analytic expression for the jost matrix more complicated .",
    "however , the remaining functions of @xmath1 are still smooth and can be approximated by just a few terms of the taylor series .",
    "we have demonstrated this using a two - channel model .",
    "+ we have shown that even with rather inaccurate experimental data ( @xmath57 in our model ) the resonances can still be found . for the narrow resonance , we managed to reproduce not only the energy and total width , but the partial widths as well , when the data points had rather big deviations from the exact values . for a wide resonance ( the resonance number 2 ) with such a high experimental noise",
    ", we still obtained reasonable parameters . and",
    "even the energy of the extremely wide resonance ( number 3 ) was obtained not far from the exact value .",
    "this shows that the proposed method is accurate and stable .",
    "+ one of the advantages of the proposed method is that the fitting procedure involves all matrix elements of the jost matrix and therefore all elements of the @xmath0-matrix even if the data are available just in one channel . the resulting @xmath0-matrix should therefore be correct in all channels .",
    "this means that by fitting accurately - measured data in one or two channels , we could in principle obtain a reasonable estimate for the cross section in the other channels where the measurements are difficult or impossible .",
    "+ it should be noted that the proposed method is non - relativistic and therefore can not be directly used in high - energy physics .",
    "there are however a wide range of problems in atomic and low - energy nuclear physics , where it could find applications . in principle",
    ", one can try the same parametrization for high energies as well , if the relativistic relation between the energy and momentum , @xmath58 , is used in all the formulae .",
    "such `` intuitive '' inclusion of relativistic kinematics into non - relativistic operators is very common for various parametrizations of scattering data in particle physics . in our case , however , this would mean that the mathematical rigor and substantiation are lost .",
