    "the hi emission line at 21  cm is very useful for studying radiative shocks in old supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the line is emitted from cold atomic gas , which is formed when the shock becomes radiative .",
    "this occurs when the shock has swept up enough ( @xmath1  @xmath2 ) column density . by analyzing hi emission lines from old snrs",
    ", we can derive some fundamental snr parameters , such as the shock velocity , mass and kinetic energy of the shocked gas , age of the snr , etc .",
    "in addition , the hi data reveal the distribution of shocked atomic gas , which can be compared with the distribution of ambient atomic and molecular gas to explore the details of the interaction of snrs with the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "understanding such details , and in particular for a reasonably large statistical sample , is crucial for understanding the supernova process itself and also the overall effects of supernovae on the ism .",
    "observationally , however , it is difficult to detect the hi emission line from shocked atomic gas , because most known snrs are located in the galactic plane where the galactic background hi emission causes severe contamination .",
    "only when the shock velocity is very large ( e.g. , @xmath3  ) is the emission clearly discernible from the background emission . in the 1980 s ,",
    "high - velocity ( hv ) emission was detected toward snrs ic 443 , g78.2 + 2.1 , ctb 80 , ctb  109 , and vro  42.05.01 ( denoyer 1978 ; giovanelli & haynes 1979 ; landecker , roger , and higgs 1980 ; braun & strom 1986 ; koo et al . 1990 ) .",
    "a systematic search of snrs was made by koo & heiles ( 1991 ; hereafter kh91 ) using the hat creek 25  m telescope ( fwhm@xmath4 ) .",
    "they observed 103 northern snrs using the hat creek 25  m telescope ( fwhm@xmath4 ) , which were all of the known snrs at @xmath5 at that time .",
    "they observed each snr at 9 points in a cross pattern centered at its catalog position and searched for broad excess emission brighter than the surrounding region .",
    "the snrs with excess emission are divided into 3 ranks , in which increasing number implies increasing reliability of the detected feature .",
    "fourteen snrs ( excluding g117.4 + 5.0 which is no longer considered an snr any more [ green 2001 ] ) showed hv excess emission which is quite likely from the gas accelerated by the snr shock and ranked 3 .",
    "the classical source ic  443 was classified as rank 2 because of some confusing emission in the surrounding region .",
    "the velocity of gas ranged from 70 to 160  with respect to the systemic velocities .",
    "follow - up high resolution observations have been made for snrs ctb 80 , w44 , and w51c , and confirmed the association ( koo et al . 1993 ; koo & heiles 1995 ; koo & moon 1997 ) .    in this paper , we present the results of a systematic search for shock - accelerated hv gas toward 97 snrs in the southern sky .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in   2 , we describe the data and the procedure for classifying snrs .",
    "we divide the snrs into three ranks in a way similar to kh91 . in   3 , we present the tables and maps summarizing the results .",
    "we have detected ten snrs with hv gas localized at the positions of snrs and another 22 snrs with some excess emission at the position of snrs . in   4 , we discuss ten individual snrs , and , in   5 , we summarize the paper .",
    "we use parkes data from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; mcclure - griffiths et al . 2001 ) for the search .",
    "the data covers @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath8 with an angular resolution of 16@xmath9 ( pixel size 4@xmath9 ) and a velocity resolution of 0.82  .",
    "the sensitivity ranges from 0.13 to 0.27 k , but it is much better ( 0.060.09 k ) in the latitude range @xmath10 . with a sensitivity of @xmath110.1  k ( 1.5@xmath12 ) ,",
    "the minimum detectable mass within a 10  velocity interval is @xmath13  , where @xmath14 is the distance to the source in kpc .",
    "there are 97 galactic snrs in green s catalog ( green 2001 ) that lie in the longitude and latitude range covered by the sgps data .",
    "we compare the average spectra of these snrs to those of the surrounding regions , and look for excessive emission wider than 10  and localized at the position of snrs .",
    "two circular / elliptical shells surrounding the snr are used for the `` off '' spectra : one which is @xmath15 ( half - beam width ) thick and has an inner boundary at @xmath15 apart from the snr boundary , and the other which is also @xmath15 thick and @xmath15 from the outer boundary of the former shell .",
    "we divide the snrs into 3 ranks , where the increasing number implies increasing reliability of the detected h  i feature :    rank 2 : snrs which have an excessive emission over the outer shell by more than the @xmath16 times of its rms fluctuation over a wide ( @xmath17  ) velocity interval .",
    "rank 3 : snrs which have an excessive emission over the inner and outer shells at extreme velocities .",
    "all other sources are ranked 1 .",
    "1 and 2 show the spectra of ranks 2 and 3 sources , respectively .",
    "our classification is similar to the kh91 s in principle , e.g. , our ranks 2 and 3 correspond to their ranks 2 and 3 , respectively , while our rank 1 includes their ranks 0 and 1 .",
    "but , since we used a shell pattern instead of a cross pattern for the  off \" spectra , the assigned ranks for individual snrs could be different ( see next section ) .",
    "snrs ranked  3 have hv gas confined to the snr .",
    "such gas is rare ; thus , it is probable that the gas is really associated with the snr .",
    "snrs ranked  2 have excess gas confined to the position of snrs , but not at an extreme velocity .",
    "real association with the snr is less certain , but the positional coincidence is suggestive .",
    "the results of our survey are summarized in table 1 .",
    "source parameters are from green ( 2001 ) .",
    "the size is the angular size in radio continuum ; a single value is quoted for nearly circular remnants , and the product of two values , the major and minor axes , is quoted for elongated remnants .",
    "the type ` s ' , ` f ' , or ` c ' represents snrs with a ` shell ' , ` filled - centre ' , or ` composite ' radio structure .",
    "the fluxes at 1 ghz are also listed .",
    "the uncertain parameters are listed with a question mark .",
    "of the 97 sources examined , 10 snrs are ranked 3 , 22 snrs are ranked 2 , and 65 snrs are ranked 1 .",
    "nine snrs had been observed by kh91 : g261.9 + 5.5 ( 2 ) , g348.5 + 0.1 ( 2 ) , g348.7 + 0.3 ( 2 ) , g349.7 + 0.2 ( 2 ) , g351.2 + 0.1 ( 2 ) , g352.7@xmath180.1 ( 2 ) , g355.9@xmath182.5 ( 0 ) , g357.7@xmath180.1 ( 2 ) , and g357.7 + 0.3 ( 2 ) , where the numbers in parenthesis are the ranks assigned by kh91 .",
    "we note that , for g261.9 + 5.5 , g348.5 + 0.1 , g348.7 + 0.3 , and g357.7@xmath180.1 , we assign a rank of 1 , which kh91 assigned a rank of 2 .",
    "the disagreement is probably due to different observing patterns , e.g. , shell versus cross .    in table  2",
    "we list , for rank 2 snrs , the velocity intervals at which the snr shows excessive emission brighter than @xmath19 and wider than 10   and the average integrated antenna temperature of the excess emission over the snr area . the intensity of the excess emission ranges from 18 to 660  k , or 0.03 to 1.2@xmath20  @xmath2 in column density ( assuming that the emission is optically thin ) .",
    "3 shows the maps of the excess emission where the dotted circles mark the positions and geometrical mean sizes of the snrs .",
    "all rank 2 snrs show at least some excess emission and we give a very short description of its morphology in table  2 . snrs which show distinct excess emission confined to a small area within or near their boundaries are g286.5@xmath181.2 , g296.1@xmath180.5 , g301.4@xmath181.0 , and g302.3 + 0.7 .",
    "table  3 summarizes the results of rank 3 snrs .",
    "the velocity intervals are approximate intervals at which the snrs show excessive emission compared to their surroundings .",
    "all sources , but two ( g320.6@xmath181.6 and g347.3@xmath180.5 ) show excess emission at negative velocities .",
    "the intensities of the excess emission are much weaker than rank 2 snrs , e.g. , 2 to 34  k  or 0.3 to 6@xmath21  @xmath2 .",
    "this may indicate that rank 3 snrs have swept up less mass and therefore relatively younger than rank 2 snrs , although some excess emission toward rank 2 snrs might be due to random fluctuations of the background emission .",
    "4 shows the maps of their excess emission .",
    "all sources show excess emission confined to them .",
    "the ones with particularly distinct excess emission are g272.2@xmath183.2 , g321.9@xmath180.3 , and g347.3@xmath180.5 .",
    "individual sources are discussed in   4 .",
    "a characteristic of rank 3 snrs is that most of them , 8 out of 10 , show excess emission at negative velocities .",
    "we note that they are all in the fourth quadrant at @xmath22 . according to kh91 , the ones in the first quadrant , 12 out of 14 ,",
    "show excess emission at positive velocities .",
    "this highly contrasting tendency is consistent with what we would expect from the galactic rotation : suppose that there is an snr which has a spherically symmetric , expanding shell in the first quadrant in the inner galaxy . along the direction toward the snr , there is a strong galactic background emission over a wide velocity interval , from negative to positive velocities . now",
    "since the lsr velocity of the snr is positive , only the receding portion of the shell will be detectable .",
    "for those in the fourth quadrant , it will be the opposite .",
    "therefore , the trend seems to suggest that most of the features in table 3 are produced by sources in the inner galaxy , probably the snrs .",
    "5 shows the longitude distribution of snrs in different ranks .",
    "the total number of observed snrs is 189 including 92 snrs observed by kh91 . for comparison ,",
    "the total number of snrs compiled by green in 2001 is 231 ( green 2001 ) .",
    "the longitude distribution of snrs is slightly asymmetric with a relatively small number of snrs between @xmath23  and 290 . out of 189 snrs",
    ", 29 snrs are classified as rank 3 , 39 snrs as rank 2 , and the rest as rank 1 .",
    "5 shows that 90% of rank-2 snrs are between @xmath24  and 50 , while it is 73% for all the observed snrs .",
    "this crowding of rank 2 snrs in the inner galaxy was noted by kh91 who attributed it to the confusion , i.e. , the long path length gives a high probability for the random fluctuations of the background emissions to produce rank-2 sources .",
    "there is no such crowding of rank 3 snrs .",
    "in the following we discuss the individual rank 3 snrs that are given listed in table 3 .",
    "three snrs , g272.2@xmath183.2 , g321.9@xmath180.3 , and g347.3@xmath180.5 , are discussed in detail , while the other snrs are discussed very briefly .",

    "all these observations seem to indicate that g272.2@xmath183.2 has been interacting with a dense medium in the west , but the almost circular shape of the snr suggests that the interaction might have started rather recently .",
    "also , the detection of the hv gas suggests that the snr shock in this region is radiative . at a distance of 5 kpc ,",
