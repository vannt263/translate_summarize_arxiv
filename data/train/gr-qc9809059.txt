    "we have many and powerful results about the static or stationary end - states of gravitational collapse .",
    "however , very little is known in comparison about the dynamical evolution towards them .",
    "analytical studies are limited by the complicated non - linear nature of the equations .",
    "numerical studies can fill this gap if they can demonstrate generic behavior .    starting with the pioneering work of choptuik @xcite ,",
    "a number of authors have shown that , despite the complicated nature of the equations , the threshold of gravitational collapse is strikingly simple @xcite .",
    "following the initial ideas of evans @xcite it has been possible to explain this simplicity as the consequence of the existence of a `` critical solution '' which acts as an intermediate attractor in phase space .",
    "this solution has a single linearly - unstable eigenmode which drives out every nearby solution either towards black hole formation or dispersal , leaving flat space behind .",
    "this body of work expands our understanding of the dynamical process of collapse , borrowing concepts and tools from the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "the emphasis is shifted to phase space , and within it , to solutions with special stability characteristics :    1 .",
    "first , we look for global attractors .",
    "the minkowski and kerr - newman solutions are the only possible end - states of collapse in the einstein - scalar - maxwell system .",
    "then we look for codimension - one attractors , which separate phase space into basins of attraction of the global attractors .",
    "these solutions are also very important . for example",
    ", the study of the trajectories connecting the codimension - one attractors with the global attractors gives us a qualitative picture of marginal collapse because many different trajectories tend to approach them and arrive at the attractors along them . in this terminology",
    ", choptuik discovered the first codimension - one attractor .",
    "for reasons still unknown , many of the codimension - one attractors are self - similar .",
    "the long - term objective is the construction of a picture of the unfolding of trajectories in phase space .",
    "it would contain all the dynamical information about a given system .",
    "furthermore it is the natural place to accommodate the zoo of special solutions we currently know of , including naked singularities .    in a previous paper @xcite we addressed the question of whether the choptuik solution was a codimension - one solution in the system einstein - maxwell - charged scalar field , restricted to spherical symmetry , and obtained an affirmative answer , which has been confirmed in independent work @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the same question for the system einstein - real scalar field , but this time allowing for arbitrary small deviations from spherical symmetry , and we obtain again an affirmative answer .",
    "the study of the einstein - maxwell - charged scalar field system beyond spherical symmetry will be reported elsewhere .",
    "this result , together with a parallel result on the collapse of a perfect fluid @xcite , strongly suggests that critical phenomena in gravitational collapse are still present in the absence of spherical symmetry . an equally strong indication that critical phenomena are not restricted to spherical symmetry is provided by numerical work on the critical collapse of axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes @xcite , which shows universality and scaling similar to that of the spherical scalar field .    the plan of the article is as follows : in section ii we give a complete review of the gerlach and sengupta @xcite formalism of gauge - invariant perturbations around a general spherically symmetric spacetime ( which typically contains matter and is time - dependent ) . in section iii we re - express these still general tensor equations of section ii in an arbitrary basis to facilitate the study of their causal structure .",
    "the equations in this section will be of help in any study of linear perturbations around spherical symmetry for arbitrary matter content , in an arbitrary background coordinate system . in section",
    "iv we specialize the formalism to massless scalar field matter . the background solution is briefly reviewed in section v , where we specialize to a particular basis , and choose a coordinate system .",
    "in sections vi and vii we split the odd and even linear perturbation equations , respectively , into evolution equations and constraints , and identify free data .",
    "section viii describes our numerical results in detail .",
    "the appendix contains a description of our numerical methods for computing the background and then the perturbations on it .    to summarize our main result here , all",
    "non - spherical physical perturbations of choptuik s solution decay , and therefore the critical phenomena at the black hole threshold in scalar field collapse  universality , echoing and scaling  are expected to persist for initial data that deviate ( slightly ) from spherical symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0 even - parity perturbations decay quite slowly , and may become apparent in non - spherical collapse situations .",
    "in this section we give a brief introduction to the formalism of gerlach and sengupta @xcite for perturbations around the most general spherically symmetric spacetime .",

    "@xmath8 is the unit gaussian - curvature metric on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath9 identifies the center of the spherical symmetry , where each @xmath2 degenerates to a point .",
    "@xmath9 is the boundary of @xmath3 . in the same way we decompose the spherically symmetric stress - energy tensor : @xmath10 for simplifying the field equations , it is useful to introduce a vector and a scalar on @xmath3 derived from the scalar @xmath7 : @xmath11 we distinguish covariant derivatives on @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 : @xmath12 we shall also need the covariantly constant unit antisymmetric tensors with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath13 , which we call @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "now we introduce an arbitrary ( not spherically symmetric ) perturbation of this spacetime : @xmath22 and again we perform a 2 + 2 decomposition .",
    "furthermore we decompose the angular ( @xmath23 ) dependence into series of tensorial spherical harmonics :    * @xmath24 are the scalar spherical harmonics , * the objects @xmath25 and @xmath26 form a complete basis of vector harmonics , and * following zerilli@xcite , we use the following basis of symmetric tensor harmonics : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , which is a linear combination of the basis introduced by regge and wheeler @xcite . for @xmath30 there is only one linearly independent tensor , namely @xmath31 , while the other two tensors vanish . gerlach and sengupta initially @xcite used the regge - wheeler basis , but in @xcite changed to zerilli s basis in order to include the cases @xmath30 into a single formalism .",

    "even and odd perturbations decouple , and different values of @xmath32 and @xmath38 decouple .",
    "furthermore , the perturbation equations do not depend on @xmath38 . in the following",
    "we consider one value of @xmath32 and @xmath38 at a time , and suppress both the indices @xmath32 and @xmath38 and the explicit summation over them .",

    "( they are just labels , not components of any vector . ) some of the coefficients on the right hand side of these expansions are not defined for @xmath30 because the corresponding spherical harmonics vanish . in the following , we always point out which of the general equations continue to hold for @xmath47 and @xmath48 if one sets these coefficients to zero .",

    "the solution at late times depends sensitively on the initial data , so that the system looks chaotic .",
    "this problem may be unavoidable with any code . our results still seem to capture the correct overall behavior , as the values of @xmath266 and @xmath253 obtained at different resolutions differ much less than the actual time series .",
    "we believe that the explanation is that different resolutions agree reasonably well on the periodic functions @xmath250 and @xmath251 , but that the initial data - dependent coefficients @xmath248 and @xmath249 take essentially random values at late times for different resolutions .    in summary , we find that both even and odd perturbations decay exponentially for all physical values of @xmath32 .",

    "the interpolation is formally second order accurate , and all background coefficients are well resolved at this resolution . to separate the convergence of the perturbations from that of the background coefficients , we used a background solution obtained with 1601 points in @xmath108 , and downsampled it by factors of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 .    as a test , we used all numerical methods on the trivial background of flat empty spacetime without a scalar field . on this background ,",

    "already in this simple test , we find that the iterated crank - nicholson method with any of the boundary treatments discussed is unstable .",
    "the instability does not have a continuum limit in space .",
    "in fact , it changes sign about every grid point in space , and grows twice as fast in time when @xmath354 is halved .",
    "nevertheless , it appears to have a continuum limit in time .",
    "the instability changes smoothly from one time step to the next , and in fact , it is practically unchanged if @xmath355 is reduced by a factor of 10 ( at constant @xmath356 ) .",
    "the instability is most apparent at @xmath116 , but in an implicit scheme , all grid points in space are of course linked .",
    "as we have not found a boundary treatment in which iterated crank - nicholson is stable , we now restrict ourselves to the two characteristic schemes . in flat space",
    "we find that they give essentially the same solution .",
    "both are stable and second - order convergent for a long time .",
    "in particular , @xmath116 and @xmath119 are perfectly normal points , as expected from the construction of the numerical scheme . at high resolutions , high @xmath32 , and late times ( for example , @xmath357 , @xmath358 , @xmath359 ) we see an oscillating instability in @xmath109 near @xmath116 that leads to a breakdown of convergence near @xmath116 , and which blows up for sufficiently large @xmath32 and high resolution .",
    "this instability appears to be a solution of the continuum equations , but for initial data which are provided by finite differencing error at late times . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have evolved a narrow gaussian pulse originally centered around @xmath360 in flat spacetime .",
    "after this pulse has left the computational domain , nothing should happen physically , and we are left with pure numerical error .",
    "we then extracted new cauchy data at a late time , at a high resolution , and restarted these data with different resolutions ( in space and time ) , down - sampling the error data as necessary .",
    "for some time we clearly see quadratic convergence , until new numerical error takes over .",
    "the instability is present already in the free wave equation in flat space , which in our rescaled variables and self - similarity coordinates is @xmath361 recall that for any @xmath32 , @xmath164 is an even function of @xmath77 of @xmath108 and @xmath166 is an odd function of @xmath362 .",
    "as the instability is centered at @xmath116 and becomes worse with increasing @xmath32 , it must be linked to the term @xmath363 .",
    "we have generalized a well known trick for the spherical wave equation which consists in absorbing this term into the @xmath108-derivative .",
    "we rewrite the equations as @xmath364 we then finite difference @xmath166 always in the way suggested by the equations , using left and right second - order one - sided derivatives to obtain the characteristic method outlined above .",
    "note that we only ever use the new derivative of @xmath166 , never the straight derivative @xmath365 .",
    "the generalization to the even and odd parity perturbations of scalar field collapse , applied to the variables @xmath166 and @xmath183 , is straightforward .",
    "in particular , the coefficients of @xmath365 and @xmath366 , although now different from unity , remain equal to each other .",
    "all other variables @xmath137 are differentiated directly with respect to @xmath108 .",
    "when we use this finite differencing method for the flat space wave equation , the late - time solution that is pure numerical error is now smooth and decays exponentially instead of blowing up , as we had hoped . on the choptuik background ,",
    "however , the instability at the center is still not suppressed . before the instability takes over , the two methods clearly converge towards each other .    we have also tested convergence of the code on the ( numerically generated ) choptuik background . here , stability requires a smaller courant factor .",
    "the differences between different resolutions are peaked at @xmath116 and are smooth functions of @xmath108 . for most values of @xmath109 and @xmath108 convergence",
    "is clearly second order , with the exception of certain value of @xmath109 near @xmath116 , where the background coefficients are particularly rapidly varying .",
    "here convergence still occurs ( differences between resolutions decrease with resolution ) , but is not of a clear order : lower than second order for low resolutions and higher than second order for high resolutions .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , second - order convergence disappears and then reappears many times .",
    "apparently error is not just growing with time , but depends very strongly on the background .",
    "the explicit and iterated characteristic methods give very similar results . at typical resolutions",
    "the differences between the two methods at the same resolution are much smaller than between resolutions .",
    "the only exception from this behavior is at early times , when the iterated method clearly shows first - order convergence that goes over smoothly into the expected second - order convergence .    in the flat empty background , pulses with support well inside @xmath119",
    "quickly leave the computational domain . on the choptuik background",
    ", we expect to find ( exponentially damped ) quasiperiodic behavior at late times .",
    "we must therefore evolve to large values of @xmath109 ( of the order of 10 to 20 background periods @xmath257 ) .",
    "not surprisingly we find that second - order convergence breaks down after a period or so , both because the quasiperiodic oscillations at different resolutions drift out of phase , and because the exponential decay rates are slightly different . at early times ,",
