    "the solution of the long - standing problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) depends , to a large extent , on advances of @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "the basic idea of this belief is straightforward and concerns both the acceleration and propagation aspects of the problem - while the localized sources of @xmath0-rays exhibit the _ sites _ of particle acceleration , the angular and spectral distributions of diffuse @xmath0-radiation give information about the _ propagation _ of crs in the galactic disk .",
    "the studies of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-radiation by egret aboard the compton gro have already made a significant contribution to the knowledge of spatial distribution of low energy crs in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many famous representatives of different classes of potential particle accelerators like pulsars , shell - type supernova remnants , giant molecular clouds and associated with them star formation regions , are identified by egret as sources of @xmath3 radiation @xcite",
    ". it should be noted , however , that most of the egret sources at low- and mid- galactic latitudes still do no have clear counterparts at other wavelengths @xcite . the next generation major space - based @xmath0-ray detector , the glast @xcite with its superior flux sensitivity ( see fig .  1 ) and",
    "good angular resolution will be able to reveal the nature of these hot spots .",
    "glast offers a broad - up to 100 gev for bright and flat - spectrum sources - spectral coverage , which ensures the great role of this instrument for studies of gcrs of intermediate energies , typically between 1 gev and 1 tev .",
    "-ray spectrum of the crab nebula is also shown . ]",
    "the energy region of @xmath0-rays beyond 100 gev is the domain of ground - based gamma - ray astronomy , and could be best explored by so - called imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) systems ( see e.g. ) .",
    "the very high energy ( vhe ) region of @xmath0-rays from 100 gev to 100 tev presents a special interest , because these @xmath0-rays carry direct information about the sources responsible for formation of the most energetic part of the spectrum of gcrs extending to the so - called ` knee ' around @xmath4 . the range of flux sensitivities that could be achieved by future iact systems is shown in fig",
    ".  1 @xcite .",
    "it is seen that glast and future iact arrays could probe point sources in a broad energy region from 0.1 gev to 10 tev at the energy flux level between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for comparison ,",
    "the flux of the crab nebula , the best studied galactic @xmath0-ray source , exceeds @xmath7 both at tev and gev energies ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , all extraterrestrial sources of high energy @xmath0-rays with fluxes as low as 10 mcrab should be detected by glast and/or future iact arrays .",
    "in particular , these instruments should be able to reveal the sites of most powerful accelerators of cr protons in our galaxy , more specifically to detect @xmath2-decay @xmath0-rays from shell - type snrs @xcite as well as from other possible non - thermal galactic source populations like pulsars , x - ray binaries , microquasars , etc .",
    "( see e.g. ) .    in this paper i do not intend to review the high energy @xmath0-ray sources ,",
    "but rather i shall focus on a specific class of objects - giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) located in the vicinity of cr accelerators .",
    "the existence of the cr accelerator by itself is a necessary but not sufficient condition for effective @xmath0-ray production ; obviously we need the second component , a _ target_.",
    "the gmcs seem to be ideal objects to play that role in our galaxy .",
    "these objects are connected with star formation regions which are believed to be the most probable ( with or without snrs ) birth places of gcrs @xcite .",
    "one of the principal parameters which determine the @xmath0-ray visibility of gmcs is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the diffuse mass of the cloud located at a distance @xmath10 from the observer . assuming that @xmath0-rays are produced by interaction of crs with the ambient gas , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath0-ray emissivity . in a `` passive '' gmc ,",
    "i.e. in a cloud submerged in the `` sea '' of gcrs , assuming that the level of the `` sea '' of gcrs is the same as the proton flux measured at the earth , @xmath13 the @xmath0-ray emissivity above 100 mev is equal to @xmath14 , where the parameter @xmath15 takes into account the contribution of nuclei both in crs and in the interstellar medium @xcite",
    ". a `` passive '' cloud can be detected at the egret sensitivity level , if @xmath16 , taking into account large angular size ( typically , several degree or more ) of objects with @xmath17 . at energies",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 @xcite , thus even for @xmath17 ( there are only several clouds in the galaxy with such a large value ) , detection of @xmath0-rays from `` passive '' clouds above 10 gev is an extremely difficult task both for glast and ground - based @xmath0-ray detectors .",
    "nevertheless , searches for very high energy @xmath0-rays from gmcs present a certain interest because of possible existence of high - energy cr accelerators nearby or inside gmcs @xcite .     and",

    "the spectrum of crs at the given time and coordinates can significantly differ from the source spectrum . while the energy - independent diffusion leads to variation of the cr flux without change of the spectral form , the energy - dependent diffusion results in a modification of the particle spectrum . in fig .",
    "2 the diffusion coefficient is assumed in a power - law form , @xmath44 above 10 gev , and constant below 10 gev .",
    "the commonly used value for diffusion coefficient at 10 gev , @xmath45 , is about @xmath46 , however smaller values , e.g. @xmath47 can not be excluded , especially in the active star formation regions .",
    "the emissivity of the @xmath2-decay @xmath0-rays within 30 pc of relatively young , @xmath48 , cr sources may significantly exceed the @xmath0-ray emissivity introduced by the `` sea '' of gcrs , if the energy release in relativistic particles per accelerator , like a supernova remnant or a pulsar , @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . under these circumstances",
    "the existence of massive gas targets like molecular clouds in these regions may result in @xmath0-ray fluxes detectable by egret , if @xmath50 . in the case of energy - dependent propagation of crs ,",
    "large variety of @xmath0-ray spectra is expected , depending on the age of the accelerator , duration of injection , the diffusion coefficient , and the location of the cloud with respect to the accelerator .",
    "therefore , at least part of the low - latitude unidentified egret sources , exhibiting a broad range of photon indices , @xmath51 @xcite , could be explained as fortuitous location of cr accelerators in the proximity of massive molecular clouds .",
    "a special interest could present also the mid - latitude egret sources which likely associate with the belt gould of massive stars and gas clouds @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , glast will be able to identify these egret hot spots , as well as to detect many more similar , but fainter",
    "( by one or two orders of magnitude ) objects",
    ".    the comparison of @xmath0-ray fluxes from clouds located at different distances from an accelerator , may provide unique information about the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "similar information may be obtained from a _ single _",
    "@xmath0-ray emitting cloud , but in different energy domains . for the energy - dependent propagation of crs",
    "the probability for simultaneous detection of a cloud in gev and tev @xmath0-rays is not very high , because the maximum fluxes at these energies are reached at different epochs ( see fig .",
    "the higher energy particles propagate faster and reach the cloud earlier , therefore the maximum of gev @xmath0-radiation appears at the epoch when the maximum of the tev @xmath0-ray flux is already over . meanwhile , in the case of energy - independent propagation ( e.g. due to strong convection ) the ratio @xmath52 is independent of time , therefore the clouds which are visible for egret at gev energies would be detectable also at very high energies , provided that the spectral index of the accelerated protons @xmath53 .",
    "the effective mixture of crs from individual sources , during their propagation in the interstellar magnetic fields on time - scales @xmath54 , determines the average density of crs throughout the galactic disk - the level of the `` sea '' of gcrs .",
    "the expected small variation of the latter on large galactic scales does not , however , exclude non - negligible gradients of the cr flux on smaller ( typically @xmath55 pc ) scales , in particular in the proximity of young cr accelerators .",
    "it is generally believed that the _ local _ , i.e. directly measured at the earth , flux of crs ( lcrs ) gives a correct estimate for the level of the `` sea '' of gcrs .",
    "however , strictly speaking , this is an _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption .",
    "in fact , it is not obvious that lcrs should be taken as undisputed representative of the whole galactic population of relativistic particles . in other words",
    ", we can not exclude that the flux of lcrs could be dominated by a single or few local sources , especially given the fact that the solar system is located in a extraordinary region - inside active star formation complexes of the the so - called gould belt with essentially ( more than factor of 3 ) enhanced core - collapse supernovae rate @xcite .",
    "because of possible contamination of the `` sea '' of gcrs by nearby cr sources , we may expect significant deviations of both the spectrum and the energy density of lcrs from the spectrum and density of gcrs .",
    "apparently , the `` gcrs@xmath56lcrs '' is an attractive _ hypothesis _ which however still lacks robust _ observational _ tests .",
    "such an inspection can be uniquely done by observations of high energy @xmath0-rays from gmcs .",
    "although this method generally requires detailed spectroscopic measurements for an ensemble of individual gmcs with known distances @xmath57 and masses @xmath58 , a reliable detection of @xmath0-radiation from even a single _ under - luminous _ gmc ,",
    "i.e. a cloud emitting @xmath0-rays below the expected `` standard '' flux ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "3 ) , would imply that the cr flux we observe at the earth is our local _ `` fog '' _ obscuring the genuine flux of gcrs .",

    "the extensive study of high energy diffuse emission towards orion by egret allowed an accurate measurement of the emissivity in the orion region above 100 mev , @xmath66 , and , more importantly , a derivation of the _ differential _ emissivity in a broad , 30 mev to 10 gev energy region @xcite .",

    "the latter with photon index @xmath69 could be naturally attributed to the bremsstrahlung of primary or secondary ( i.e. @xmath70-decay ) electrons .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "4a that the superposition of the ` power - law ' and ` @xmath2-decay ' contributions satisfactorily fits ( dashed line ) the derived experimental points , if we ignore the last , 1 to 10 gev egret point .",
    "note , however , that such a fit is achieved assuming a reduced , by a factor of 1.5 , cr flux in orion compared with the local cr flux . perhaps , we should not overemphasize this difference , taking into account non - negligible systematic errors in the reported fluxes of local crs , as well as uncertainties in the hydrogen column density used for derivation of the @xmath0-ray emissivity .",
    "however , the discrepancy becomes really significant if we include in the fit the measured highest energy point at 1 - 10 gev .",
    "this point apparently requires harder cr spectrum .",
    "the lack of @xmath0-ray measurements above 10 gev do not allow robust constraints on the power - low index , but , most probably , it should not exceed 2.3 . in particular , fig .",
    "4b shows that a good fit to the egret data could be achieved assuming a flat spectrum of protons with power - law index @xmath60 , and energy density of particles below @xmath71  tev at the level of @xmath61 , which is by a factor of 1.7 less than the energy density of local cr protons given by eq .",
    "note that the fit in fig .",
    "4b does not include the @xmath0-ray flux produced by the `` sea '' of gcrs .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the observed @xmath0-ray flux is contributed by particles accelerated within the orion complex , with a significantly less ( although unavoidable ) contribution from gcrs homogeneously distributed throughout the galactic disk , and freely passing through the molecular clouds .",
    "an extra contribution by gcrs around 1 gev would lead to an overproduction of @xmath0-rays , unless we assume that the level of the `` sea '' of gcrs at energies @xmath72 does not exceed , for the given @xmath0-ray flux uncertainties , approximately @xmath73 of the directly measured flux of lcrs .",
    "such a dramatic conclusion formally could be avoided speculating that crs can not freely penetrate into the dense clouds ( see , however , ) .",
    "for example , assuming that the coefficient of reflectivity of crs from a cloud decreases with energy , e.g. @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , one can fix the required hard spectrum of particles without invoking additional cr accelerators inside orion .",
    "both these possibilities generally do not agree with the conventional models of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "nevertheless , a thorough analysis based on future comprehensive @xmath0-ray data is obviously needed before any strong claim about a necessity for revision of the current basic concepts of origin and propagation of crs .",
    "in particular , it should be noticed that the conclusion about hard cr spectrum in orion is based merely on the reported @xmath0-ray flux above 1 gev .",
    "this indicates the importance of extension of accurate spectroscopic measurements of @xmath0-radiation from orion , as well from other individual @xmath0-ray emitting clouds detected towards cepheus , monoceros , and ophiuchus @xcite , to the energy region beyond 10 gev .",
    "also , it would be important to investigate contributions of other @xmath0-ray emission processes , in particular of the inverse compton component contributed by relativistic electrons , albeit in dense gas regions the @xmath2-decay radiation is believed to be the dominant @xmath0-ray production channel .",
    "these measurements should allow an effective separation of contributions from the `` sea '' of galactic crs and from the local cr accelerators .",
    "it is especially important to extend the measurements to higher energies .",
    "if the `` excess '' flux at 1 - 10 gev from orion is indeed due to the local accelerator(s ) , we may expect continuation of this hard spectrum well beyond 10 gev , depending on the high energy cutoff in the cr spectrum ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hypothesis of the energy - dependent reflection of galactic crs from dense clouds ( assuming that gcrs@xmath56lcrs ) , predicts an essentially different spectrum of @xmath0-rays - a flat part below a few gev , with a quite steep power - law tail with @xmath76 , at higher energies .",
    "this part of the spectrum is produced by protons of the `` sea '' of gcrs which freely enter the cloud .",
    "such standard high energy @xmath0-ray tails should be observed from other local clouds as well .",
    "large - scale co surveys of molecular clouds by dame et al .",
    "( 1987 ) revealed two dozens of local gmcs within 1 kpc with @xmath16 .",
    "the study of high energy @xmath0-rays from these clouds with a broad - distribution of distances from @xmath77 ( like the taurus dark clouds or aquila rift ) to 800 pc ( like cyg ob7 and cyg rift ) , which should be easily visible for glast , presents a great interest for derivation of spatial and spectral distributions of crs in our local environment .",
    "moreover , it is likely that glast will be able to extent the study of massive gmcs , and therefore to probe the flux of galactic crs , beyond 1 kpc .",
