    "traditionally , wireless access networks have been designed to support a moderate number of high - rate devices .",

    "the use of traditional access protocols for mmtc traffic results in excessive signaling overhead  @xcite , a large share of which is due to signaling for authentication / security .",

    "the number of messages per device in the first phase is variable , as the contention outcome , dependent on the number of devices , may imply repetition of the access phase . the number of the messages involved in phase 2 and 3 is fixed . after all three phases have been completed",

    "[ fig : arpcomparison ]    security in cellular access protocols is usually an `` afterthought '' , such that the related signaling is exchanged after the radio resources are granted to a device . the protocol efficiency , expressed as the ratio of the data vs. the signaling exchanges , decreases significantly for small payloads , as in iot / mmtc traffic .",
    "the signaling overhead can be reduced by excluding the authentication and security and combining the _ access _ and _ rrm _ phases , while including a small data payload in the signaling exchange  @xcite . in this paper , we take take a different approach and we integrate , instead of exclude , the establishment of the security context with the access protocol . in this way",
    "the security becomes _ native _ to the access protocol , which results in significant overhead reduction .",

    "[ fig : arpcomparison](b ) , achieves the same functionality as the protocol on fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison](a ) in terms of radio resource reservation and security , but with significantly less signalling .",

    "finally , the data , encrypted and and with its integrity protected , is sent over the network .",
    "the main idea of the proposed scheme is to let devices contend with signatures that embed authentication information , thereby integrating the access and the authentication protocol .",
    "a signature is a combination of @xmath17 preambles transmitted over a _",
    "frame _ of @xmath18 raos ; each preamble of a signature is sent in a separate rao .",
    "the number of available signatures is @xmath19 , potentially allowing to detect exponentially more contenders compared to the case in which the preambles sent over @xmath18 raos are treated independently , where the maximal number of detected contenders is @xmath20 .",

    "the parameters are : ( i ) the random challenge rand of length 128 bits ; ( ii ) the frame length @xmath18 ; and ( iii ) the number @xmath17 of preambles in each signature .",
    "the device starts its authentication by running the user authentication function @xmath39 , which outputs a 64-bit vector ; we note that @xmath40 is known only to the @xmath41 mtd and the bs , via the home subscriber server ( hss ) .",
    "the @xmath41 mtd s access signature is generated as @xmath42 and sent to the bs .",

    "[ fig : iterativedecodingexample ]      the bs iteratively decodes the signatures based on ( partial ) observation after each received rao of the signature frame .",
    "specifically , the bs compares the partial observation with all valid signatures in the cell .",
    "any mtd whose signature is not matched , becomes removed from the list of possible contenders .",
    "each time a signature is decoded , the bs informs the respective mtds that they can stop sending the remainder of their signatures and proceed to phase two of the access protocol .",

    ", the bs is not yet able to determine the state of @xmath80 , but after rao 3 , @xmath80 is detected as active .",
    "this is because only @xmath80 and @xmath78 could have activated the preamble observed in this rao , and , as @xmath78 has already been detected and stopped transmitting , this is the evidence that @xmath80 is indeed active .",
    "as by the end of the third rao all the users have been decoded , there is no need for the fourth rao of the frame .",
    "another advantage of the iterative decoding is that decoding instances are spread over the frame , which leads to the spreading of the feedback messages , i.e. , the rrc connection setup message in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison](b ) . also , a portion of the signatures become decoded before the end of the signature frame , in some cases without transmitting all @xmath17 active preambles .",
    "the latter phenomenon allows for lower transmission overhead and brings additional security to the authentication procedure , as the mtd s full signature is not exposed .",
    "in the following , we provide a brief discussion of the robustness of the proposed authentication scheme to the _ man in the middle _ attack  @xcite and signature collision .",
    "the attacker listens to all the traffic transmitted over the air interface . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the attacker can observe values of rand , @xmath18 and @xmath17 that are broadcast unencrypted to all the devices prior to the start of the signature frame , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : authenticationsignature ] , as well as all the preambles transmitted over the signature frame . from @xmath18 and @xmath17 , the attacker can estimate the number of devices that will attempt access in the signature frame according to  .",
    "when iterative signature decoding is used , the attacker will not be able to infer full signatures of all devices , as a fraction of them become decoded before being transmitted entirely .",
    "if @xmath46 active devices send their signatures , the attacker will perceive @xmath81 active preambles across the signature frame .",
    "the attacker can not discern easily the valid signatures , as it will observe @xmath82 possible signatures .",
    "the worst case occurs when a single device sends its entire signature , as then the attacker knows the realization of @xmath42 for the known rand .",
    "yet , we note that @xmath40 is not known to the attacker and therefore the captured signature can only be used for replay attack in the future if that rand occurs again , which happens with probability @xmath83 . without knowing @xmath40 , the attacker can not generate the keys ck and ik and thus can not decrypt the data being transmitted over the air interface .",
    "even if the attacker has a mechanism in place that can reverse the signature to find out the corresponding @xmath39 , it still needs at least @xmath84 different observations to be able to reverse @xmath85 and from there determine @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "hence , the proposed scheme makes it more difficult for the attacker to discover the actual @xmath40 , as the attacker needs to reverse @xmath42 , instead of only @xmath39 , as it is the case in lte .",
    "[ fig : averagegoodput ]      another important aspect is the occurrence of signature collisions , which can cause the connection establishment protocol to fail .",
    "the lte authentication function @xmath39 outputs a @xmath86bit vector , while its inputs @xmath40 and @xmath87 are @xmath88bit vectors .",
    "there is a non - zero probability that the output of @xmath85 will be the same for two or more devices , given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 comes from the assumption that the output of @xmath85 is uniform  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is a non - zero probability that two or more devices share the same signature , given by the probability of signature collisions , @xmath91 , as @xmath92 and @xmath1 as the total number of devices .",
    "the overall probability of collision of the signatures from two or more devices is @xmath93 .",
    "the average latency @xmath94 observed by a contending mtd is upper bounded as @xmath95 where the first term accounts the latency due to the access being frame - based .",
    "the second term corresponds to the worst case , in which the signature is decoded at the end of the frame .    as for the protocol overhead ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : arpcomparison](b ) , the number of protocol messages exchanged corresponds to : ( 1 ) the transmission of signature preambles ( up to @xmath17 ) , ( 2 ) the resource allocation for the small data transmission in the downlink , and ( 3 ) the actual data transmission .",
