    "the initial detection of the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) in the far - infrared ( fir ) using _ cobe _ between 100 and 240 @xmath0 m by @xcite , @xcite , and preliminarily by @xcite , showed that a large part of all the radiation produced in the universe since the recombination epoch is contained in the cirb . in the context of understanding galaxy formation and evolution , and indeed the history of all luminous matter in the universe , it is thus important to understand what and where the cirb contributors are . this has been a subject of intense work ever since the cobe results ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the isophot ebl project aimed to determine the level of cirb independently from the cobe data by making use of the better resolution of _ iso _ which allows looking into the very deepest regions on the fir sky in - between galactic cirrus clouds .",
    "the fir source counts from this project were reported in @xcite . the cirb surface brightness in three wavelengths 90 , 150 and 180 @xmath0",
    "m was recently presented in @xcite  this constituted the first independent verification of the absolute cirb level since the various cobe results . in between 150 and 180 @xmath0 m",
    "the cirb was measured to be @xmath4 mjy sr@xmath5 and at 90 @xmath0 m a 2@xmath6 upper limit of 2.3 mjy sr@xmath5 was measured , all values consistent with the cobe measurements obtained with the dirbe and firas instruments .",
    "however , only the bright tail of fir sources contributing to the cirb can be resolved with data from past missions , reaching to typical levels of somewhat fainter than @xmath7 mjy at 180  @xmath8 m .",
    "the fir source counts at 90 to 180  @xmath8 m in our project contribute @xmath9 per cent of the cirb surface brightness @xcite .",
    "this result is similar to other fir studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when looking at the fir sources directly using _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ , and _",
    "statistically one can probe fainter fir populations by using e.g.  stacking methods , as shown by @xcite and @xcite . due to significantly",
    "less severe confusion , the resolved fraction of individual sources in the mid - ir 15 and 24 @xmath0 m mid - ir wavelengths is much higher , around 60 to 75 per cent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite report resolving 60 per cent of the cirb also at 70  @xmath0 m using fluctuation studies and extrapolated source counts . at wavelengths longer than this ,",
    "up until @xmath10  @xmath0 m , the fraction of _ directly _ resolved cirb sources has essentially not changed since the various isophot studies .",
    "the recent blast experiment reports resolving the fir background at 500 @xmath0 m by stacking a spitzer 24 @xmath0 m catalog against their fir map @xcite .    during the decade of fir",
    "follow - up studies it has also become evident how difficult it is to identify the optical and near - ir counterparts of these fir sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically only a third , or a half , of the fir sources have unambiguous counterparts at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the problem is this : because of the large beam sizes there are many possible counterparts in optical images within the positional error circles of fir sources .",
    "hence , to aid identification other waveband data , especially mir or radio data , and often quite elaborate decision trees are typically used to merge catalogs with unique counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another difficulty arising from the large beam sizes is the high level of confusion among the fir detections resulting in blended objects , which in turn make the optical identifications even more complicated .",
    "these difficulties indirectly affect mid - ir studies as well , since many interesting cosmological or galaxy evolution results from the mir surveys require information of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the fir part of the spectra of the targets .",
    "these are just not available to similar depths , unless the mir data itself is used to identify sources and construct fir seds , leading into possibly unhealthy dependencies .",
    "nevertheless , a basic expectation and consensus has been built where the fir sources are either local ir - bright sources dominated by cold cirrus emission or higher redshift sources whose strong ir - luminosity raises them into the class of luminous or ultra - luminous ir - galaxies ( lirgs or ulirgs,@xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively ) .",
    "the relative amounts of sources in these classes depend on the depth of the survey ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . to interpret the cosmological evolution of ir - bright galaxies , it remains crucial to understand the exact nature of galaxies emitting at 100 to 200 @xmath0 m where the cirb peaks .",
    "the imminent herschel data will probe these galaxies to further distances @xcite and it is important to determine the characteristics of the more nearby bright fir galaxy population for reference .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the source detections of the isophot ebl project by presenting optical and nir follow - up observations of the isophot ngp fields . rather than trying to _ force _ individual optical and nir counterparts for each fir source , we assess carefully the possibility of confused , or blended , sources .",
    "in addition , we do not use mid - ir or radio data to identify sources .",
    "we present the properties of all the unambiguous matches and discuss the level of likely confusion in the fir source list .",
    "if it were to be shown that a significant fraction of isophot sources are actually confused sums of several objects , or even whole galaxy groups or clusters , fir source counts and their evolutionary interpretation might have to be revised .    in a second paper of the series ( visnen et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will concentrate on the correlations of the fir source positions with significant peaks in the galaxy surface density , any signs of clustering and any _ bona fide _ galaxy clusters .",
    "we use a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath13 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 throughout .",
    "the isophot observations are fully described in @xcite .",
    "the north galactic pole ( ngp ) field with an area of 1.07 sq.deg covers 2/3 of the whole isophot ebl project area and contains 22 individual sources in the 170 and 150 @xmath0 m bands , and 25 sources at 90 @xmath8 m .",
    "sources were detected down to @xmath1 mjy in all three bands , while simulations indicated a typical 70 per cent or more completeness at @xmath10 mjy .",
    "the three extra detections in the 90 @xmath0 m are in fact sources very close to another 90 @xmath0 m source , and the two of them share the same single longer wavelength isophot detection ; we therefore have followup of 22 different fields - of - view .",
    "all these fields were targeted with ground based observations presented in this paper .",
    "observations were performed using the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma .",
    "optical data were taken on 8 - 10 april 2003 using the alfosc instrument , and the near - ir observations were carried out on 13 - 15 april 2003 using the notcam instrument .",
    "alfosc is a 2x2k ccd camera , giving a field of view of 6.4x6.4. we obtained 900 sec @xmath16 and @xmath17-band ( filters 76 and 12 ) images of the target fields , split into three separate offset integrations .",
    "the data were reduced and combined in the standard manner using iraf .",
    "notcam is a 1x1k `` hawaii '' near infrared camera .",
    "the low resolution mode of the instrument was used , giving a 4x4 field of view .",
    "we obtained @xmath18-band images of all the fields .",
    "target fields were observed in 1-minute dithers for a total of 25-minute integration time per field .",
    "the flatfielding ( twilight flats were used ) , sky frame construction , sky subtraction , and registering and co - adding of the frames into final nir images was performed using the xdimsum package along with dedicated idl routines .",
    "seeing remained in the range @xmath19 arcsec in @xmath18-band and @xmath20 in the optical bands throughout our observing runs .",
    "the astrometry for both optical and infrared images was obtained through matching gsc2 stars  we estimate the accuracy to be better than 0.4  throughout the frames .",
    "we note that while the ngp area has not been observed by other targeted fir surveys in the past , it will shortly be covered by the herschel thousand degree survey ( pi : eales . )",
    "all photometry was derived using the sextractor ( v2.3.2 ) software @xcite .",
    "both aperture and auto magnitudes were used as detailed below .",
    "we maximised the detection efficiency by performing systematic and comprehensive testing of the sextractor settings with our data .",
    "numbers of real and potentially spurious objects were determined by using both deeper data , i.e. checking the deeper optical images when performing nir photometry , and negatives of the final images in case of optical frames .",
    "we calculated numerous aperture magnitudes , as well as the auto and best magnitudes , which dynamically adjust the size of the aperture depending on the shape and size of the object . by using curves - of - growth with bright non - saturated stars , we determined aperture corrections for slightly different seeing conditions and fixed size apertures .",
    "when giving colours we typically refer to magnitudes calculated inside 2.6  diameter apertures , approximately 2.5 times typical seeing , corrected to the @xmath18-band seeing value .",
    "however , total magnitudes , adopting the best magnitude which we find to be most robust in our uncrowded fields with both extended galaxies brighter than @xmath16=23 mag and compact objects throughout our magnitude range , are used when a single - band brightness is given for an object .",
    "we checked these to be totally consistent with the total magnitudes derived from curves of growth used for standard stars .",
    "an exception is made with bright galaxies clearly larger than @xmath21  for which these total magnitudes are used throughout , also in the seds . in summary",
    ", we estimate our photometry to be accurate to approximately 0.03 mags in the optical and 0.05 in the nir data .",
    "finally , we checked that our photometry was consistent within few percent with 2mass galaxies found in our areas .",
    "zero - point calibrations were obtained through observations of standard stars throughout the nights , which were photometric .",
    "the absolute calibration to vega - based system is estimated to be accurate to 0.02 and 0.05 mag in the optical and nir , respectively .",
    "the extinction coefficents were fixed to average values of the nights , to @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18-bands , respectively .",
    "in addition , a colour - term of @xmath25 was used to derive the final optical magnitudes .    since detection of optical objects",
    "was done with co - added @xmath26 frames , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 band source lists have the same number of objects . these were cross - correlated with the @xmath18-band source list to produce source lists of 3-band detections , optical detections only ( since @xmath27 data is deeper than nir ) , and nir - only ( including very red objects ) .",
    "we also extracted _ ugriz _ photometry from the sdss dr7 @xcite archives for all our fields to complement our own dataset .",
    "sdss data are shallower than our own optical @xmath27 data , but they extend the wavelength range of the brighter galaxies and thus make sed fitting significantly more reliable .",
    "after testing with different magnitudes we found that we acquire the best results , the smoothest combined seds , when adopting total magnitudes , as described above , for our own photometry , and petrosian magnitudes for the sdss galaxies brighter than @xmath28 mag , and sdss model magnitudes for those fainter than this limit .",
    "as discussed in section  [ intro ] , identification of fir sources is difficult because of confusion and the large beam sizes .",
    "typical approaches include using supplementary mir or radio surveys in helping to decide which of the many galaxies within the beam is the correct counterpart , and then running likelihood ratio methods taking into account the distance of counterpart candidates from the fir source as well as the surface densities of all relevant populations . often the _ one _ mir and/or radio galaxy giving the largest likelihood is chosen as the counterpart , unless _ no _ candidates are found above a given probability threshold ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further analysis , sed fitting etc . , is based on this identification . while the advantage obviously is to have a well - defined and quantitative method , the downsides include possible biases depending on the `` indicator source '' and especially the difficulty of assessing the possibility of _ multiple galaxies contributing to the fir source_. in this paper we attempt a much more straight - forward philosophy , though admittedly one less robustly defined .",
    "we first searched for all sources with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18-band detections within 60  of the centre of the isophot detection . making use of the sextractor star vs.  galaxy neural network classifier",
    ", we excluded clear stellar objects by selecting only those with a mean class parameter less than @xmath29 in all the three bands .",
    "typically there remain 20 to 50 extended objects per isophot error circle .",
    "the optical / nir sources were then matched also with the sdss catalogs by searching for common objects within 1  radius .",
    "next we fitted template seds using the hyperz software @xcite to all sources found in the isophot error circles .",
    "the whole range of wavelengths from uv to fir was fitted , our optical and nir datapoints along with the five sdss bands and three isophot points .",
    "the fainter targets not having sdss photometry were fitted with @xmath30+iso only .",
    "the model templates were taken from , or calculated using , the grasil library / code @xcite  in particular we used a range of sc - type seds of different age , different age ellipticals , fully evolved sa and sb galaxies , as well as model fits to the seds of ngc 6946 , ngc 6090 , m82 , arp 220 , and hr10 , which respectively represent star - forming dwarfs , interacting / starbursting galaxies , warmer starbursts , ( ultra ) luminous ir galaxies , and extremely obscured objects .    when fitting the templates within hyperz , we turned off reddening since the grasil sed models already have dust and gas properties with consistent extinction and re - emission mechanisms and effects built in throughout the wide spectral range .",
    "we assumed a @xmath31 mag uncertainty in the relative matching of fir and ground - based parts of the sed due to uncertain aperture effects .",
    "the source catalogs in the target fields , now associated with photometric redshifts , best - fit sed templates , and especially the related chi - square values and probabilities attached to the hyperz fits , form the basis of the selection of counterparts .",
    "note especially that we do _ not _ use any information of the distance to the fir detection centre in the analysis , but treat all sources in the error circle equally .",
    "@xcite cite a typical blended fir source distance of 55  in their 90 @xmath0 m data , and such cases would be severely misinterpreted by e.g.  just picking the closest candidate to the fir detection centre ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , we note that by fitting known templates to objects we can not get away from the bias against totally unknown classes of sources , which plagues all fir identification studies .",
    "we also searched the sdss spectroscopic archive for any available spectra for the bright galaxies in the target fields . within the isophot error circles",
    "12 redshifts were found , and for these objects the redshift was fixed in the hyperz fit .    to have a quantitative measure of the morphology of the brighter galaxies in the field",
    ", we used the galfit program @xcite to model the surface brightness distributions of the @xmath27 combined images .      based on the types of optical - nir objects within the 1 arcmin search radius characterized by their magnitudes , seds",
    ", model fits and redshifts ( photometric or spectroscopic ) , as well as morphologies , we separated the 22 fir objects in the present sample into two groups : in the first instance , we find 5 fields which have a single bright @xmath32 mag galaxy in the isophot detection circle .",
    "all these galaxies are more than two magnitudes brighter than any other object in the area and they are all well fit with a template sed all the way from uv and optical to fir .",
    "they also have sdss spectroscopy available which is consistent with their nature as fir sources .",
    "they are all brighter than @xmath18=14.8 mag and we note that using average bright @xmath18-band galaxy counts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is less than 10 per cent probability to find a @xmath33 mag galaxy inside a 60   radius circle .",
    "we refer to these five _ unambiguous isophot counterparts _ as the `` bright sample '' .",
    "the second group of isophot targets , 17 of them , is called the `` faint sample '' , referring to the brightness of the counterpart galaxies , not that of the fir flux .",
    "there are essential differences amongst these sources , however .",
    "more than half of the fields do actually have fairly bright @xmath34 mag galaxies in them , but there are usually two to four of them , suggesting possible blending .",
    "the rest of the fields , on the other hand , look initially empty of any obvious counterpart candidates . when investigating the faint sample individually below , we categorize them according to how and why the cases are ambiguous .      to have an independent characterization of the brighter counterparts with redshifts , or secure estimates thereof , we modelled them with the radiative transfer models of @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter err03 ) .",
    "the models incorporate the stellar population synthesis model of @xcite and the dust model of @xcite which treats small transiently heated grains and pah molecules as well as large classical grains .",
    "the models have been shown to be in good agreement with the spectral energy distributions of starburst and cirrus - dominated galaxies @xcite .",
    "all the fir sources of the bright sample defined above have fir source quality flag values of @xmath35 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in at least one detected band .",
    "the sources are listed in table  [ table - bright ] along with some characteristics based on grasil model fits , whereas table  [ table - bright2 ] lists the err03 model fits .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the bright isophot galaxies in this field appear to be gas rich galaxies with clearly elevated star - formation at about the lirg - class limit , but without evidence in our data for strong ( nuclear ) star - bursts . from optical data alone , e.g.  with their quite uniform @xmath73 , our sample is indistinguishable from other local relatively high mass `` blue - cloud '' galaxies . as they are close to the red - sequence , it could be speculated that they are moving towards it , the effects of which can be seen in their ir and morphological properties .",
    "the bright fir selected sources in this survey and others tend to be ( nearby ) cold galaxies , whereas the local ulirgs typically have warmer seds .",

    "this makes detailed studies of the physical conditions in local fir selected samples of ir - bright _",
    "non-_ulirgs very motivating .",
    "among the rest of our fir targets , the faint sample , there are several cases where there either are optional counterparts , or strong reasons to suspect a blend of two or more bright galaxies .",
    "the ( likely ) properties of this set can be summarized as follows :    a blend of two or more spiral galaxies at redshifts @xmath2 is responsible for the isophot detection in 9 cases ( npg02 , ngp05 , npg07 , ngp11 , ngp12 , ngp14 , ngp18 , ngp23 , ngp25 ) . the photometric redshifts and grasil sed types of the individual counterparts are essentially identical to the unambiguous cases in sections  [ brightgals ] and  [ brightdiscuss ] , though the optical colours show a slightly larger range than the unambiguous bright sample .",
    "since we are not able to distribute the fir flux to blended counterparts with spectroscopic redshifts , we will not attempt to model their physical characteristics in detail .",
    "however , we did run the err03 models on several cases where there e.g.  were two spiral galaxies with reasonably secure photometric redshifts : the cirrus and starburst luminosities and dust characteristics and star - formation rates again come out to be very similar to the bright unambiguous set of fir sources .",
    "they are often at slightly higher redshifts , but due to dividing the fir fluxes to two or more sources , the @xmath40 and sfr values end up very similar .",
    "thus , in total _ 14/22 or 64 per cent of the fir sources in the isophot ebl project ngp fields are low - redshift @xmath2 moderately star - forming galaxies_. the discussion presented in section  [ brightdiscuss ] above applies directly to all these sources , the majority detected in our survey .",
    "four other blended fir sources ( ngp06 , ngp15 , ngp16 , npg19 ) also include a contribution , possibly a major contribution , from a bright spiral or starburst . in these fields , however , we have also identified fainter red galaxies which might well be higher redshift ( u)lirgs also contributing the fir flux",
    ".      there are four fields ( ngp04 , ngp09 , ngp10 , npg21 ) , where the only likely counterpart appears to be a higher redshift , @xmath74 , ( u)lirg , or a sum of them .",
    "higher redshift counterparts thus account for a minimum of 18 per cent of the fir sources . including ones where a higher-@xmath38 source is possibly blended with a lower-@xmath38 counterpart , up to a maximum of 36 per cent of our ngp targets include an ir - galaxy at @xmath74 .",
    "overall we found 23 per cent of the ngp fields to have a uniquely identified target , while another 41 per cent are identified as blends of bright galaxies . in the various firback and lockman hole surveys , typically @xmath75 per cent of sources are identified @xcite , and the rest remain unidentified .",
    "the fractions are similar to ours even though the methods of identification have been quite different : most of the above works considered only a bright sub - set , typically half , of their total source catalogs , and they all employed mid - ir and radio data in the identification which we have not done .    if the general fractions of identified and unidentified sources are similar to other works , what about the characteristics of the counterparts ?",
    "we identified at least 64 per cent of all targets as fairly normal cool or cold ir luminous spiral galaxies at @xmath2 , regardless of confusion issues .",
    "if the cases of likely bright and faint galaxy blends are included , the fraction rises to 82 per cent .",
    "similarly , the fraction of contributions from higher redshift ( u)lirg type galaxies is in between 18 and 36 per cent .",
    "it is important to note that these cases are not different in their fir properties from the rest of the ngp isophot sources .",
    "again , the results are very consistent with other surveys . in general ,",
    "previous isophot fir follow - up surveys have found a bi - modal distribution of a large , approximately three - quarters majority of low - redshift quiescent galaxies and a minority higher redshift ulirgs at @xmath76 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) than ours and firback s @xmath77150 mjy , the fraction of sources at redshift higher than 0.3 starts to rise slightly .",
    "the dust temperatures we find are similar to ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite while @xcite derive slightly higher temperatures in the range 2040 k. early results from the fir surveys with _",
    "akari _ also suggest large contributions from local @xmath78 galaxies @xcite .",
    "spitzer mips results also result in a broadly equivalent picture : the deeper mips sources at 70 @xmath0 m ( down to 4 mjy ) appear to be starbursts at @xmath38=0.11.2 with a mean and median at @xmath79 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the 160 @xmath0 m sources ( to 100 mjy ) are mostly `` starburst galaxies '' at @xmath80 though generally not of the active , warm sed type of m82 and arp 220 , but with cooler seds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do identify a difference to previous follow - up surveys , however .",
    "four out of five of our bright unambiguous counterparts , as well as more than half of the identifiable blended counterpart options are clearly disturbed or interacting galaxies .",
    "in contrast , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found that their counterparts to elais n1 survey do _ not _ show evidence of interactions , and also @xcite cite a small minority as interacting sources in the lockman hole survey .",
    "we are not sure what the reason for this difference is , unless it is just that our optical data is somewhat deeper than theirs making morphological classification easier .",
    "the majority of the galaxy counterparts in `` deep '' fir surveys discussed in this paper are in fact very similar to the large sample of much brighter galaxies at @xmath81jy detected as part of the isophot 170 @xmath0 m serendipity survey @xcite .",
    "previous fir surveys have been described to a reasonable accuracy by models of e.g.  @xcite and recently by @xcite .",
    "the models have been specifically constructed to fit the source counts at various wavelengths , and also the level and spectral shape of cirb .",
    "they are broadly consistent with the bimodal distribution of fir sources described above .",
    "for example the 160 @xmath0 m spitzer counts are dominated by `` cirrus '' galaxies brighter than 80 mjy , and by m82-type starbursts fainter than this limit according to the @xcite models , and at 150 mjy , more or less at our survey limit , quiescent galaxies should outnumber starbursts by a factor of three , consistently with the nature of @xmath82 sources found in the ngp fields .",
    "however , a recent fir / sub - mm follow - up of @xmath83 at the longer wavelengths of 250 and 500 @xmath0 m @xcite find that these same bimodal models are a poor fit to the their data , as are also early akari counts of @xcite , highlighting the fact that the exact nature of galaxies emitting their peak at 100 to 200 @xmath0 m , where the cirb also peaks , remains of great importance .      in our ngp - field follow - up",
    "most of the fir sources , 17/22 or approximately 70 per cent , can not be identified unambiguously with a single optical counterpart , though there clearly are different classes of ambiguity . of these 17 isophot detections",
    "9 are cases where the most likely counterpart of the fir detection is a sum of two or more fairly bright ( @xmath52 mag ) and nearby ( @xmath2 ) star - forming galaxies , and in another four cases one such bright nearby spiral appears to be a component in the confused fir source .",
    "further four fields do not have any nearby galaxies in them , leaving the explanation for the fir flux to either be a single higher redshift ulirg type source , or a sum of several of these  there is no way to differentiate between these cases with the present data .",
    "thus , based on the present data , about 60 per cent of whole sample are definitely blended objects , with another 20 per cent possibly so . similarly to our survey",
    ", @xcite find 50 per cent of their identified sources multiple , and @xcite note that up to 50 per cent of the firback sources are not ideally matched with a single counterpart .",
    "how does the blending and confusion affect interpretations of fir populations ?",
    "in addition to making identifications and sed fits of individual galaxies difficult and sometimes suspect , it also affects the fir source counts themselves . as an example , fig .",
    "[ counts - v1 ] shows the raw 180  @xmath0 m source counts from our isophot ebl project @xcite as well as raw firback / elais counts from @xcite .",
    "the solid symbols are original points , whereas the open symbols show the effect of blending . in the left panel",
    "we plot the ngp counts , with the following modifications : green open squares are a case where the 9 objects definitely consisting of bright blends are divided into two discrete equal - flux sources ; blue diamonds show a case where each detection in the faint sample is divided into two discrete sources of equal flux ; and magenta triangles depict a case where each detection in the faint sample is divided into two sources where one has 2/3 and the other 1/3 of the flux .    to see the effect with somewhat larger number statistics , the second panel shows the counts from the whole isophot ebl survey .",
    "in this case we do not have the information on possible blending of each individual source , so we make a statistical estimate .",
    "the blue open diamonds , equivalently to the left panel , show the average of 10000 realizations of the original counts , where randomly selected 60 per cent of the fir sources are replaced with _ two _ sources of half of the original flux each .",
    "the error bars reflect the standard deviation of the simulated counts .",
    "the triangles show the case where the random 60 per cent are divided into a 2/3 and a 1/3 flux source , as above .",
    "we remind the reader that there is no difference in the flux distribution of the blended and unique sources , justifying the selection of split sources from the whole population . since firback / elais surveys saw very similar fractions of non - unique counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we ran the same test on the firback 175 @xmath0 m catalog , and the result is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ counts - v1 ] , where the symbols and colours are equivalent to the first two panels .",
    "in addition , we overplot the raw mips 160 @xmath0 m counts of @xcite with green circles . only those points in the firback and mips counts which have completeness of 85 per cent and above are plotted .",
    "though the faintest plotted raw count bins are affected by incompleteness , it still is clear from fig .",
    "[ counts - v1 ] that the reshuffling of flux typically takes some 30 to 60 per cent of the abundant 100 to 400 mjy sources and shifts them into flux bins in between 50 and 200 mjy .",
    "the resulting differential counts move down broadly by a factor of @xmath3 , and steepen the faint end in the presented examples where 60 per cent of sources are affected .",
    "we ran the statistical blending correction with a variety of affected percentage of sources , and a range in the fractions and number of underlying sources corresponding to a fir detection : e.g.  when 30 per cent of sources are affected in a way that 1/5 of a source flux is given to a new faint source , the necessary downward correction of counts is still approximately a factor of @xmath84 . where splitting is more even the correction is larger , and rises to factors of few if three or more underlying sources are concerned . only if the affected source population is below 20 per cent , are the required corrections negligible compared to the errors of the observed counts .",
    "interestingly , the mips counts fall closer to the blending - corrected isophot counts and are not compatible with the uncorrected ones .",
    "the explanation is in the confusion levels .",
    "there are two kinds of `` confusion '' : one due to fluctuations of all the unresolved sources below the detection limit and the other due to the effective beam size not resolving properly sources too close to each other",
    ". one can talk about confusion `` noise '' in the first case , and e.g.  `` blending '' in the second case , and of the respective confusion limits as a `` photometric confusion limit '' and a `` source density criterion '' often given in terms of beams per source in the latter case .",
    "both effects are non - trivial as they obviously depend on the shape of the source count slope both above and below the confusion limits and other factors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for the cases here , the mips 160 @xmath0 m beam of @xmath85  is smaller than the respective c200 isophot beam of @xmath86  size , and assuming a euclidean slope this means that the confusion `` noise '' is expected to be 3 times higher for isophot , and even more for steeper counts .",
    "indeed , for a set of source counts @xcite and @xcite estimate the confusion `` noise '' limits to be in the region of 50 and 160 mjy for mips 160 @xmath0 m and isophot 180 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "these values correspond roughly to @xmath87 or more beams per source , which is a limit one should use with steep counts @xcite .",
    "hence , the isophot counts we are considering clearly reach right to the level of expected confusion , whereas only the two deepest @xcite points at @xmath88 mjy in the fig .",
    "[ counts - v1 ] approach the mips confusion limit .",
    "an added complication in confusion estimates is _ clustering _ of sources which increases the confusion limits with an increasing severity as the source counts get steeper ",
    "@xcite show how the effect can be factors of a few or more for super - euclidean slopes .",
    "an attempt to estimate the effect quantitatively is beyond the scope of this paper , but as we have clearly seen , we often detect close pairs or groups of likely counterparts within the fir beam size , so the confusion limits cited above are likely lower limits .",
    "it thus should come as no surprise that the isophot fir galaxy counts , both ours and others in the literature , have been significantly affected by confusion , as probably are the very deepest mips fir counts .",
    "one should also be aware that any upward bumps in source count slopes when approaching the confusion regime , are likely due to confusion noise effects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) and not real sources , especially in the case of super - euclidean counts such as these .    in summary",
    ", the effects of confusion and blending on source counts , their likely too high normalization and differences in slopes , must be properly taken into account when modelling the count slopes with galaxy populations .",
    "luminosity functions based on fir counts will be affected as well .",
    "we have presented follow - up observations in the ngp fields of the isophot ebl project . this fir survey complemented the other major @xmath82 fir projects of elais , firback and lockman hole , by detecting sources in three bands , and also by being able to determine the absolute level of the cirb @xcite .",
    "the ngp fields consist of 1.64 sq.deg area and 25 unique fir sources in the 90 @xmath0 m band and 22 in the 150 and 180 @xmath0 m .",
    "we imaged these fields with the not in the optical and nir , and employed sed fitting techniques as well as morphological analysis to determine the counterparts of the fir sources in the 1   radius isophot error circles .",
    "only five sources were securely identified with a single bright nearby galaxy .",
    "one of these is a local dwarf galaxy , but all the others are ir - luminous @xmath89 , fairly massive 0.3 - 1.0@xmath63 star - forming spirals at redshifts of @xmath36 .",
    "their star - formation rates range from 7 to 26 @xmath90 , dust temperatures are @xmath91  k and dust masses @xmath92 .",
    "such cold and fairly local galaxies have been found before in @xmath82 and @xmath93 fir surveys selected in the 100 - 200 @xmath0 m range .",
    "we note in addition that in our data most of these appear to have disturbed morphologies showing signs of present or past interactions .",
    "nine more fir targets were securely identified with _",
    "multiple _ galaxies .",
    "it turns out , however , that these cases have essentially identical physical characteristics with the first single - galaxy counterpart group , with the slight difference that their redshift range extends to @xmath54 .",
    "thus 2/3 of our fir galaxies are definitely relatively normal ir - luminous cold star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "half of the remaining cases , nearly 20 per cent of the total , also have a bright star - forming galaxy in the field , but to be explained the fir flux needs additional contribution from an optically fainter galaxy .",
    "finally , the second half of the remaining cases have only fainter galaxies in the area . in all these cases we were able to find two or three good candidates for lirgs or ulirgs in the range @xmath94 , which could explain the fir flux . without further spectroscopy",
    "the exact identification remains ambiguous however .",
    "given the large number of blends , we tested the often ignored aspect of how the confused sources affect the fir source counts themselves . by using both our results and those from previous surveys , we showed that significant reshuffling of fir fluxes is very likely to happen : a large fraction of apparent fir sources at the 200 - 500 mjy range are in fact bound to be double or triple sources each with fluxes in the range 50 - 300 mjy .",
    "this has the effect of both decreasing the normalization of the fir counts by a factor of @xmath95 and also steepening the count slope somewhat , especially at the faint end .",
    "this has to be taken into account when modelling fir source counts .",
    "finally , many of the ngp isophot fir sources appear to be part of significant galaxy concentrations , pairs , groups or perhaps even clusters .",
    "what this tells about the fir sources and the reasons why they are ir - luminous , will be investigated in more detail in another paper .",
