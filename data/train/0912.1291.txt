    "recently , much effort has been devoted to measure the vector and scalar @xmath8 form factors in semileptonic kaon decays in order to determine the phase space integrals .",
    "these integrals , along with the kaon branching fractions , allow to determine the ckm matrix element @xmath9 .",
    "the scalar form factor ( @xmath10 ) is difficult to measure because it is kinematically suppressed in @xmath11 decays , and is therefore only measurable in @xmath12 decays , which have contributions from both the scalar and vector form factors .",

    ". the parameters measured in a fit to the data are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the slope of the form factors and the curvature of the vector one , and @xmath19 , the mass of the vector and scalar resonances .",
    "while the second order taylor expansion has been used to measure the vector form factor with sufficient precision , the scalar form factor can only be determined using the first - order taylor expansion or the pole model . however , clearly one has at least to know the curvature to have a proper description of @xmath20 in the physical region of @xmath21-decays . after results were reported based on the taylor and pole parametrizations , a form factor parametrization based on conformal mapping",

    "it involves only one free parameter for both the scalar and vector form factors to be determined from the existing data sample .",
    "the sole scalar form factor parameter is @xmath4 , the value of the normalized scalar form factor at the callan - treiman ( ct ) point , @xmath24 , the difference of kaon and pion masses squared .",
    "once @xmath4 is determined , the shape of the scalar form factor is known with a high precision in the physical region and somewhat beyond .",

    "[ sec : parametrisations ] , and the robustness of the dispersive result presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .    for this study",
    ", we will perform several fits of the @xmath42 data .",
    "we will always use the dispersive parameterization for the scalar form factor . for the vector form factor",
    ", we will consider a cubic expansion , i.e. , the first three terms of eq .",
    "( [ taylor ] ) will be taken into account .",
    "indeed , in the physical region of @xmath42 decay , a good representation of the dispersive parameterization may be obtained by taylor expanding it with respect to @xmath114 and keeping only the first three terms .",
    "we thus have four parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 ) which will enter the fitting procedure .",
    "let us first fix the third order coefficient @xmath117 to zero , which corresponds to a fit with a quadratic parametrization for the vector form factor .",
    "we then perform a fit with two free parameters , namely @xmath40 and @xmath115 , while fixing the curvature @xmath118 to three different values : @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 would correspond to a linear parameterization for the vector form factor , which gives a very poor fit to the data ) .",

    "the value of @xmath40 and the @xmath124 of the corresponding fit are given in parenthesis above each point .",
    "to simulate the presence of higher order terms in the z - parameterization , for the red line a third order term has been included .",
    "the effect of this third order term is only to shift the curve downwards . in the legend , `` quad./disp . '' for example",
    "indicates that a `` quadratic '' parametrization is used for the vector form factor and a `` dispersive '' one for the scalar . _",
    "_ ]    the value of @xmath115 can be read on the @xmath125 axis and @xmath40 is given by the first number in parentheses above each black point ; the second number in parentheses gives the @xmath124 of the fit .",
    "the linear relationship between @xmath123 and @xmath118 seen on the figure shows the strong correlation between these two quantities .",
    "for example , a fit to @xmath11 data using a quadratic parameterization for the vector form factor leads to a correlation , @xmath126  @xcite .",
    "a similar linear dependence is also obtained between @xmath40 and @xmath123 or @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , when moving toward larger @xmath118 , @xmath40 decreases while the @xmath124 decreases only slightly .",
    "the green square at the end of the solid black line represents the minimum @xmath124 ; it corresponds to the result of the quadratic / dispersive fit given in section  [ sec : parametrisations ] .",
    "( we have stopped the line at that value of the curvature for convenience . )",
    "next , we consider the impact of a third - order term in the taylor expansion . indeed",
    ", a dispersive or z - parameterization of the vector form factor gives a non - zero value for the third order coefficient @xmath127 when taylor expanded .",
    "we repeat the same procedure as above ( i.e. , floating @xmath40 and @xmath115 , and varying @xmath118 ) , but the third - order coefficient is now fixed to @xmath128 , close to what is obtained from the results of the z - parameterization ( tables ii and iii ) .",
    "the nonzero @xmath127 causes an offset in the linear dependence of @xmath123 with @xmath118 , but leads to the same slope and a similar variation of @xmath40 with the slope and the curvature ( see the red dot - dot - dashed line on fig .",
    "[ fig : curvature ] ) . the minimum @xmath124 fit ( green square for @xmath129 )",
    "is now moved toward a smaller @xmath118 and a larger @xmath123 ( red triangle denoted by min. this point corresponds to the z - parameterization result in table ii . ) the parameter shifts are required in order to compensate for the additional cubic term . note that the value of @xmath40 is roughly the same at this minimum as the one obtained previously for @xmath129 .    in the light of this study ,",
    "let us now consider the other parameterizations used in the literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can distinguish two classes .",
    "one class ( class i ) , of which the dispersive and pole parameterizations are examples , impose physically motivated relations between the slope and the curvature ( and possibly the higher order terms in the taylor expansion , the third order term being the most relevant one in the physical region ) .",
    "indeed , as already emphasized , in the dispersive parameterization the curvature and all higher order terms of the vector form factor are constrained not only on first principles , such as analyticity and unitarity , but also by including the information on the low energy @xmath23 @xmath130-waves ( @xmath131 resonance ) .",
    "the relation between slope and curvature is illustrated by the blue dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvature ] .",
    "this curve crosses the black solid line and the red dot - dot - dashed line for large values of @xmath123 , small values of @xmath118 , and consequently large values for @xmath40 , nicely illustrating the result of the dispersive / dispersive fit ( magenta diamond in the figure ) .",
    "in contrast , the second class ( class ii ) , of which the taylor series and z - parameterization are examples , is based on mathematically rigorous expansions , in which the slope and curvature are free parameters .",
    "clearly , the existence of a relation between slope and curvature strongly constrains the fit in class i , while the fit has more freedom when using class ii parameterizations .",
    "one thus expects smaller fitting uncertainties in the results from the class i and larger ones from class ii , so that if the theoretical errors are well controlled , the overall uncertainty will be smaller for class i.    one of us ( v. b. ) would like to thank s. descotes - genon and b. moussallam for interesting discussions .",
