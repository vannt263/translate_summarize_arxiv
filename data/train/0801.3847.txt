    "since 1998 @xcite evidence has been mounting in support of an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "nearly 10 years on , the puzzle of the origin of this acceleration  dubbed dark energy",
    " remains one of the most intriguing enigmas in modern day science .",
    "much activity has come from both the theoretical and observational sectors of the physics community in an attempt to pin down its origin .",
    "the current drive in dark energy studies is focused on trying to establish its dynamical behaviour as a function of redshift , @xmath0 .",
    "while the simplest explanation remains a @xmath5cdm universe with @xmath6 for all redshift , dynamics in @xmath0 would provide a window into new physics .",
    "therefore , uncovering the dynamics of dark energy as described by the ratio of its pressure to density , @xmath7 , has become the focus of multi - billion dollar proposed experiments using a wide variety of methods , with several planned surveys at redshifts above unity , as high - redshift measurements are useful to constrain dark energy parameters and test for deviation from the concordance @xmath5cdm model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately the search for dynamical behaviour in @xmath1 is a mani - fold problem .",
    "the nature of dark energy is elusive : cosmic observations depend not only on dark energy but also on other cosmic parameters such as the cosmic curvature , @xmath3 , and the total matter content , @xmath4 , leading to degeneracies between these and @xmath0 parameters , an issue which has recently been under intense scrutiny by the community @xcite .",
    "kunz @xcite argues that observations are only sensitive to the full energy - momentum tensor and thus can not see beyond a combination of the  dark component \"  dark matter _ plus _ dark energy .",
    "the degeneracy between the geometry of the universe and the equation of state of dark energy has also been discussed in light of the well - known result that a cosmological constant in the presence of spatial curvature can mimic a dynamical dark energy @xcite .    in this work",
    "we review current constraints on cosmic curvature and extend the approach in @xcite in two ways .",
    "first we include the reconstruction of @xmath0 that would follow from measurements of the rate of change of cosmic volume with redshift , @xmath8 .",
    "secondly we discuss the @xmath0 that would be incorrectly reconstructed from perfect hubble , distance and volume data if the wrong value of @xmath4 were used .",
    "we assume perfect data for all observations , which allows us to probe fundamental ,  in - principle \" degeneracies that are not due to finite errors and incomplete redshift - coverage .",
    "this implies that given a specific bias in a cosmological parameter , the degeneracies will be true no matter what progress is made in improving future cosmic surveys .",
    "furthermore , the key point in our reconstruction of @xmath0 is that it is performed in a fully non - parametric manner , and so does not rely on the validity of any particular parameterisation of @xmath0 . to illustrate the power of this non - parametric approach , we compare our method with a standard equation of state parameterisation @xcite , which can not fully resolve the above degeneracies .",
    "the success of the inflationary scenario for the early universe and its standard prediction of flatness to high precision ( @xmath9 ) is perhaps the main reason why curvature has traditionally been left out in analyses of dark energy .",
    "however , possible scenarios in which inflation is consistent with non - zero spatial curvature have recently been investigated @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the backreaction of cosmological fluctuations may cause effective non - zero curvature that may yield practical limits on our ability to measure @xmath0 accurately at @xmath2 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have so far proved consistent with flatness ( e.g. @xcite ) statistical quantities that measure the necessity of introducing extra parameters ( such as bayesian evidence or information criteria @xcite ) do not favour the inclusion of curvature as a parameter in current analyses @xcite .",
    "however this is more a symptom of the inability of current data to constrain an extra parameter than a conclusive case for a flat universe .",
    "further , bayesian evidence or information criteria do not take into account the power of the biases that may be introduced by falsely neglecting a parameter .",
    "we will show below that the biases introduced in neglecting curvature are very significant at @xmath2 .    in general constraints on curvature",
    "are very fragile to assumptions about the dark energy since they are primarily derived from distance measurements ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) which are completely degenerate with curvature @xcite .",
    "one way to illustrate the degeneracy between curvature and dynamics is as follows .",
    "let us assume that we know all cosmic parameters perfectly other than the curvature @xmath3 and the dark energy equation of state , @xmath0 . at any redshift , @xmath12 , a perfect measurement of @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 )",
    "allows us to measure a single quantity .",
    "if we know @xmath15 then that quantity can be @xmath3 .",
    "however , if @xmath0 is truly a free function , then its value at @xmath12 is completely free and we are left trying to find two numbers from a single observation , which is impossible .",
    "only when we start to correlate the values of @xmath0 at different redshifts can we begin to use distance measurements alone to constrain the curvature .",
    "the standard way to do this is to assume that @xmath0 can be compressed onto a finite - dimensional subspace described by @xmath16 parameters , e.g. @xmath17 in this case perfect distance measurements at @xmath18 different redshifts will allow a complete solution of the problem and will yield the @xmath19 and @xmath3 .",
    "the most extreme version of this is to assume @xmath5cdm , @xmath20 . within this context",
    "it is of course possible to derive very stringent constraints on the curvature .",
    "for example , combining the wmap 3 year data and the sdss dr5 luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample leads to @xmath21 assuming @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the addition of extra data is crucial since the wmap data alone provides only the constraint @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it is a highly non - trivial statement that flat @xmath5cdm models provide such a good fit to all the data , but we must be aware that such constraints on the curvature are artificially strong in the sense that adding more dark energy parameters will lead to an almost perfect degeneracy with the curvature .",
    "this is visible in fig .",
    "17 of the wmap3 @xcite ( here fig .",
    "[ wmap17 ] ) which shows the correlation between a constant @xmath1 and @xmath3 .     and",
    "@xmath3 based on combined data from wmap3 , 2dfgrs , sdss and supernova surveys . while the slope of the degeneracy differs for this combination of data , the sign of the degeneracy is consistent with the @xmath24 term in eqs .",
    "( [ degenhub]),([degend ] ) . taken from @xcite.[wmap17 ] ]    hence we can currently say very little about the true value of the @xmath3 and the belief that the spatial curvature is small is essentially based on occam s razor .",
    "although one could fit distance measurements with any value of @xmath3 , the required @xmath0 functions would be disfavoured by bayesian model selection which penalize models with extra parameters that do not significantly improve the fit .",
    "we show in detail later the required @xmath0 functions to do precisely this .    at present a well - defined program for measuring the spatial curvature of the cosmos",
    "does not exist . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider fixing the dark energy to be described by only @xmath16 parameters .",
    "one would hope that given this restriction the resulting constraints on @xmath3 would be independent of the precise choice of the @xmath16 parameters , i.e. independent of the parameterisation .",
    "unfortunately a little thought makes it clear that this can not be true .",
    "a parameterisation of @xmath0 which does not allow mimicry of curvature will provide good , decorrelated constraints on the curvature ( which does not mean the corresponding best - fit will be a good fit to the data ) while a model which allows perfect mimicry of the dynamics of the curvature ( i.e. @xmath25 ) will show highly correlated constraints ( although for negative @xmath3 mimicry of distance data is only possible up to a critical redshift as we show later ) .     for different parameterisations of dark energy .",
    "assuming a constant model for @xmath1 , allows @xmath3 to be tightly constrained at @xmath26 to be near 0 .",
    "however introducing dynamics reduces these constraints significantly . here",
    "@xmath27 is the dark energy density , which @xcite assume is a free function below some cut - off redshift @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 at redshifts @xmath30 are treated as @xmath16 independent model parameters that are estimated from the data .",
    "a specific functional form for @xmath29 is assumed above the cut - off redshift .",
    "the likelihoods are given for two such forms of @xmath31 ; namely a power law , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and an exponential function @xmath34 . in these figures",
    "there are @xmath35 independent redshifts below a cut - off redshift of @xmath36 . taken from @xcite[wangfig].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this dilemma is visible in various recent studies attempting to constrain cosmic curvature in the presence of multiple dark energy @xmath0 parameters @xcite . for some popular parameterisation constraints on @xmath3 are of order @xmath37 at @xmath26 . for other parameterisation",
    "the constraints evaporate and even @xmath38 can not be ruled out ( see fig .",
    "[ wangfig ] , which is taken from @xcite ) .",
    "alternative cosmic measurements sensitive to curvature include the integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect , which is sensitive to the growth of the metric fluctuations @xmath39 , which is in turn sensitive to both dark energy and curvature .",
    "recent work to investigate the isw effect as a function of redshift uses the combination of cmb data with information on large scale structure @xcite . combining wmap with such suitable tracers of large scale structure",
    "shows that @xmath39 has been decreasing with cosmic time @xcite , which rules out a large positive curvature which would have predicted the opposite trend .",
    "another measurement sensitive to the growth function is differential number counts @xmath40 , e.g. of clusters .",
    "this is a potentially sensitive test which , given a constant comoving number of objects , reduces to a test of the rate of change of cosmic volume with redshift , @xmath8 .",
    "we discuss in detail below how perfect measurements of @xmath8 allow reconstruction of @xmath0 , and we discuss the resulting errors on dark energy when systematic biases in cosmic parameters are present .",
    "measurements of the power spectrum from cmb data and from measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) provide estimates of the matter content of the universe .",
    "while constraints on @xmath4 are sharpened by combining data from many observations , the best - fit value is often derived on the assumption of flatness @xcite . unlike the case for cosmic curvature",
    "the degeneracy between observables and the matter content is perfect and we show that incorrectly assuming a particular value for @xmath4 can also mimic deviations from @xmath5cdm",
    ".      we will show in equation ( [ curv ] ) that simultaneous measurements of the hubble rate @xmath41 , distance @xmath42 and @xmath43 allow for a perfect measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "bao allow for the simultaneous measurement of both distance and hubble rate at the central redshift @xcite . for a flat universe @xmath44 , but in a curved universe this is not true : the curved geodesics mean that @xmath43 contains extra information encoded in @xmath3 .",
    "measuring @xmath43 is in principle possible with future bao , weak lensing and supernova surveys . in particular",
    ", cross - correlation tomography of deep lensing surveys appears to be a very powerful probe of curvature when combined with bao surveys @xcite , assuming that self - calibration is possible . in principle",
    "it should be possible to measure the cosmic curvature to an accuracy of about @xmath45 for an all - sky weak lensing and bao survey out to @xmath46 .",
    "in principle such a survey would be able to measure distances to about @xmath47 in redshift bins of width @xmath48 out to @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this relies critically on the combination of weak lensing and bao data since constraints from either observations alone are significantly degraded .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "( [ knoxfig ] ) which shows the error ellipses for the parameters in the cpl parameterisation @xmath50 assuming flatness ( left ) and leaving @xmath3 free ( right ) .",
    "note that although individual error ellipses are significantly degraded , the combined data sets have an almost unchanged error ellipse .    our work is organized as follows : we illustrate the dependence of the background observables on the cosmological parameters @xmath51 in section [ bg_expand ] and discuss obtaining the dark energy equation of state @xmath1 from observables in section [ obs_eos ] .",
    "the process of reconstructing @xmath1 via a non - parametric approach is described in section [ recon_w ] .",
    "finally we link this non - parametric approach to other standard approaches to dark energy degeneracies in section [ param ] and conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "there are three key observables of the background geometry which play a pivotal role in determining @xmath0 , namely measurements of distances , of the expansion history ( i.e. the hubble parameter ) and of the change in the fractional volume of the universe ( e.g. from number - counts ) .",
    "the principle method to date is to relate measurements of the distances of objects to the cosmology of the universe .",
    "this is done via either standard ` rulers ' of known length - giving the angular diameter distance @xmath52 - or via standard ` candles ' of known brightness which results in the luminosity distance @xmath53 .",
    "these are related via the reciprocity relation @xmath54 . in an flrw model ,",
    "these are given by @xmath55 , where we define @xmath56 here , @xmath3 is the usual curvature parameter , and @xmath41 is given by the friedmann equation , @xmath57 \\label{hubble}\\ ] ] where @xmath58}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , given a cosmological model , we may calculate any distance measure we choose .",
    "the hubble parameter is in itself an observable which will play an important role in future dark energy experiments .",
    "knowledge of @xmath41 allows us to directly probe the dynamical behavior of the universe , and it will be directly determined from bao surveys which simultaneously provide the angular diameter distance , @xmath11 at the same redshift by exploiting the radial and angular views of the acoustic oscillation scale @xcite , a fact that will provide key new data in coming years @xcite .    the third key background test we will discuss here is the observation of fractional volume change as a function of redshift , @xmath60 which can in principle be determined via number - counts or the bao .    given any two of the above observables we may deduce the third .",
    "perfect observations of these observables should allow us , in principle , to be able to reconstruct two free _ functions _ when in fact we only need to reconstruct one , namely @xmath0 , as well as two cosmological parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
