    "dynamical studies of spiral galaxies often make the distinction between the bulge and the disk : the bulge is associated with the hot `` spheroidal '' component which mainly contains stars , and the disk is a rapidly rotating thin structure which also contains a substantial fraction of the total amount of interstellar gas .",
    "line - of - sight velocity distributions are efficient probes of the dynamical structures of these systems , and can be used to derive the mass distribution , structural properties , and perturbations of the gravitational potential linked to @xmath2 or @xmath1 modes , or to external triggers such as interactions .",
    "these can be obtained with classical long - slit spectrography , although it requires a - priori assumptions for the orientation of the slits . a time - consuming way to obtain velocity fields through single slits",
    "is to spatially scan the galaxy with successive individual exposures ( e.g. , statler 1994 ; ohtani 1995 ) .",
    "integral field spectrography in the optical ( ifs , adam 1989 ; afanasiev 1990 ; bacon 1995 ; davies 1997 ; garca - lorenzo , arribas & mediavilla 2000 ; roth , laux & heilemann 2000 ; bacon 2001 ; bershady 2004 ) was designed to uniformly cover the field of view which makes it possible to study these systems in a much improved way : the analysis is not constrained by a priori choices of slit position , and the gaseous and stellar components can be observed simultaneously .",
    "optical ifs is often used complementarily to h@xmath0i  and fabry - perot scanning interferometers , ( e.g. , van gorkom 1986 ; plana & boulesteix 1996 ) as the latter usually have excellent spatial coverage but a limited spectral domain , only probing a couple of lines ( mostly in emission ) .",
    "although circular rotation is the dominant kinematic feature of the disk component , previous observational as well as theoretical studies have shown the presence of non - circular motions ( e.g. , freeman 1965 ; combes & gerin 1985 ; shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ; athanassoula 1994 ; shlosman & noguchi 1993 ; moiseev 2000 ; regan & teuben 2004 ; wong , blitz & bosma 2004 ) .",
    "cold disk - like systems are more prone than bulges to perturbations and instabilities , the dissipative gaseous component being more responsive than the stellar component ( e.g. , thielheim & wolff 1982 ) .",
    "perturbations of the gas dynamics can lead to significant galaxy evolution via , e.g. , redistribution of the angular momentum , triggering of star formation , or building of a central mass concentration .",
    "bars are potential actors in this context as they can drive mass inwards or outwards , and may participate in the complex process which eventually leads to the fuelling of an active nucleus ( e.g. , simkin , su & schwarz 1980 , sakamoto , baker & scoville 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of large - scale bars has been correlated with starbursts ( e.g. , martinet & friedli 1997 ) and nuclear rings ( shlosman 1999 ) , but only weakly if at all with nuclear activity ( e.g. , knapen 2000 ) .",
    "this may not be so surprising as the fuelling of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , i.e. , gas accretion onto a massive black hole , involves rather small spatial and short time - scales , so might not be related to the kpc scale bar .",
    "inner small bars ( shlosman 1989 ) may sometimes help to link the different spatial scales ( emsellem , goudfrooij & ferruit 2003 ) , but they probably can not serve as a universal mechanism . agn activity is short - lived and occurs in the central astronomical units of galaxies , whereas current studies have focused on long - lived phenomena influencing the central kpc scale . in order to properly study the influence of a bar on the redistribution of mass in the central kpc of a galaxy , we need to obtain constraints both on the source of the underlying gravitational potential and on some tracer of the on - going perturbations . this can be achieved by simultaneously studying the stellar and gas dynamics .",
    "we have observed 24 early - type spiral ( sa ) galaxies with the sauron   integral field spectrograph ( bacon 2001 ) , mounted at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos at la palma ( de zeeuw 2002 ) .",
    "most of these galaxies are found to have gas velocity fields that strongly deviate from that of a simple rotating disk .",
    "for the present study , we selected ngc  5448 out of the sa sauron  sample which shows a clear sign of the presence of a bar in its photometry and which has a significant amount of ionised - gas ( falcn - barroso 2005 ) . in this paper",

    "the method which we have applied to derive the emission - line kinematics is described and validated in sarzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and falcn - barroso et al .",
    "it consists of iteratively searching for the emission - line velocities and velocity dispersions , while solving at each step for both their amplitudes and the optimal combination of the stellar templates over the full sauron  wavelength range .",
    "no masking of the regions affected by emission is thus required .",
    "our binning scheme was optimised for the derivation of reliable stellar kinematics , but is not necessarily well adapted to analyse the emission - line gas . since the gaseous component commonly rotates faster than the stellar component , to obtain reliable gas kinematics , in general a lower @xmath8  is required .",
    "moreover , gas and stars do not necessarily share the same spatial distributions . as a consequence ,",
    "the stellar bins are often larger than necessary for the gas , implying a loss of spatial information for analysing the gaseous component ( fathi 2004 ) .",
    "accordingly , the data that we present in this paper has a minimum stellar @xmath8  of 60 and a minimum emission - line amplitude - over - noise of 3 .    finally , we have carefully inspected the emission - line profiles to search for possible asymmetric profiles but have not found any significant deviation from a pure gaussian , nor any significant indication for more than one component being present in the profiles , at least at the instrumental resolution of sauron .",
    "we know from other sauron  studies of e.g. , ngc  1068 ( emsellem et al .",
    "2005 ) that we can resolve several components in very strong agns .",
    "in this section we start with a simple mathematical model , and then add complexity as required by the observational constraints . in the simplest model ,",

    "this simple model can not explain most observed velocity fields .",
    "the gas kinematics in real galaxies exhibits radial and/or vertical motions due to , e.g. , the presence of bars , spiral arms , which create angle - dependent velocities which can not be explained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vxy ] ) , and hence additional ingredients in the analysis method are required .",
    "several attempts have been made to investigate more complex velocity fields ( sakhibov & smirnov 1989 ; canzian 1993 ; schoenmakers , franx & de zeeuw 1997 [ hereafter sfdz ] ; fridman & khoruzhii 2003 ; wong 2004 ; krajnovi 2005 ) .",
    "the main idea of these techniques is to deal separately with the `` unperturbed '' underlying component and the residual velocity field , obtained by subtracting the reconstructed unperturbed velocity field from the data . to solve the problem ,",
    "as stated , one would have to know the unperturbed velocity component at a given radius .",
    "unfortunately we do not know beforehand the unperturbed velocity field .",
    "a powerful technique for unveiling the perturbations makes use of the expansion of the velocity information in fourier harmonic components . following the terminology of sfdz ( see their appendix for the detailed derivation ) , given that the line - of - sight velocity can be expressed as a two - dimensional analytic function of galactocentric coordinates , it can be written as a fourier series : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of harmonics , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 give us information about the nature of the perturbations , and they are tightly connected to the underlying potential .",
    "note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations by burlak ( 2000 ) have shown that this formalism is very stable and its results are rather insensitive to the presence of holes in the velocity field .",
    "our quantitative analysis uses the formalism of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) combined with the tilted - ring method ( rogstad , lockart & wright 1974 ; rogstad , wright & lockart 1976 ) , inspired from the rotcur  routine in the gipsy  package ( begeman 1987 ; van der hulst 1992 ) .",
    "accordingly , we divide the galaxy disk into concentric ellipses within which we fit the rotation velocity and the set of geometric parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) .",
    "the method assumes that each pixel in the velocity field is identified with a unique position in the galaxy and that circular rotation is the dominant feature .",
    "we assume that our measurements refer to positions on a single inclined disk , i.e. , that we do not expect a strong warp and/or overlapping spiral arms within the observed field .",
    "accounting for harmonic perturbations up to order 3 , this method results in a large parameter - space problem , and it requires some additional assumptions to obtain a physically meaningful solution .",
    "we obtain the parameters by proceeding as follows :    1 .",
    "we start from a simple inclined two - dimensional disk . in case of erroneous inclination",
    ", one would detect systematics in the residual field as explained in section  [ sec : errors ] . using a two - dimensional disk produces a robust model , in the sense that warps and other deviations from this basic model should be prominent in the residual maps .",
    "secondly , we fix the dynamical centre of the galaxy to coincide with the photometric centre .",
    "the photometric center is obtained by fixing the center of the @xmath35 band image , since the @xmath35-band image is less affected by dust . the hst @xmath9-band image and the sauron  image",
    "are then aligned with the hst @xmath35-band image .",
    "3 .   at every radius",
    ", we fit @xmath36 , varying @xmath37 , pa , and @xmath38 .",
    "the result is used to fix the systemic velocity ( @xmath15@xmath39 ) simply as the mean value over radius , using tukey s bi - weight mean formalism ( mosteller & tukey 1977 ) , which is particularly advantageous for being non - sensitive to outliers .",
    "after @xmath15 , we fit the pa and @xmath38 , followed by fixing the pa in the same way as the @xmath15  was fixed .",
    "4 .   for each ring",
    ", we import the values derived according to the recipe above , and fit the rotation curve and the higher harmonic components ( up to order 3 ) applying a @xmath40-minimisation scheme . these results are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : analysis ] .",
    "analysing the first , second , and third harmonic components only , is an efficient way to analyse specific elements of the perturbations on the underlying potential .",
    "a perturbation of order @xmath41 creates @xmath42 and @xmath43 line - of - sight velocity terms ( see e.g. , canzian 1993 and sfdz ) . as a result ,",
    "our fitted @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  terms contain information about possible @xmath1 perturbations .",
    "when sectioning the field into concentric rings , the radial extent of each ring is a free parameter which has to be pre - determined . for a range of possible ring radii , we have examined the fitted velocity information .",
    "determination of the radial thickness of the rings becomes a trade - off between smoothness of the fitted velocity field , and robustness of the fit .",
    "radially thin rings result in smooth fits , and thus smooth residual ( data - fit ) fields , whereas radially thick rings result in lower errors for the fitted parameters .",
    "patchy gas distribution causes non - uniform distribution of points , and it is important to make sure that all the rings include enough points to fit harmonic parameters to reasonable accuracy .",
    "this is particularly important in the innermost and outermost points .",
    "we adopt a geometric increase of the ring radii ( meaning that the radial width of the rings is increased by a factor 1 + step ) . here",
    ", we adopt a step of @xmath47 , and only fit the inner 30  of the sauron  velocity field , since rings larger than this radius are not sufficiently covered and hence do not deliver reliably derived parameters .",
    "finally , since we are simultaneously fitting 6 harmonic components , we make sure that each ellipse contains at least @xmath48 data points , in order to obtain reliable errors .",
    "warner ( 1973 ) and van der kruit & allen ( 1978 ) showed that assuming wrong input disk parameters could cause recognisable signatures in the residual velocity fields .",
    "sfdz quantified these signatures in terms of harmonic expansion , and showed that the fourier components due to non - circular motions will mix with those due to erroneous disk parameters @xmath49 and pa .",
    "errors in the kinematic centre translate to the @xmath37 , @xmath50  and @xmath51  terms , while pa errors appear in the @xmath44  and @xmath46   terms , and inclination errors in the @xmath38  and @xmath45  terms . in the case of erroneous kinematic centre ,",
    "the @xmath37  and the @xmath50   terms fall off as @xmath52 whereas the presence of a radius - independent @xmath2 mode shows the relation @xmath53 ( schoenmakers 1999 ) .",
    "our chosen centre coordinates do not deliver any of these situations .",
    "another source of error is `` pixel sampling '' for which errors propagate onto the @xmath38  ( as the rotation curve rises more gradually ) and the @xmath45  term ( as if inclination changes ) .",
    "this effect may also propagate onto the @xmath44   and @xmath46  parameters , although not significantly ( wong 2000 ) . our data and analysis does not require consideration of this effect since our spatial resolution is high enough .",
    "our data extraction code delivers error measurements for each individual pixel ( falcn - barroso et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we calculate the errors for the tilted - ring and harmonic parameters by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "repeated application of the tilted - ring method to the gaussian randomised gas velocity field yields the uncertainties on the harmonic parameters .",
    "our 500 simulations show that choosing geometrically increasing ring radii with steps of @xmath47 indeed yields satisfactory errors .",
    "the errors are low , and the parameter profiles are represented by an adequate number of points .",
    "the sfdz formalism is a very powerful tool for analysing velocity fields .",
    "one can analytically derive the higher - order harmonic parameters for potentials of desired form . schoenmakers ( 1999 )",
    "derived the harmonic parameters for a lopsided potential , and a more extensive expansion was done by wong ( 2004 ) , who derived the higher - order harmonics for simple bar and two - armed spiral perturbations .",
    "we import their model for a globally elongated gravitational potential , which , in the plane of the galaxy , consists of an axisymmetric component @xmath54 from kuijken & tremaine ( 1994 ) , with a bi - symmetric potential of the form @xmath55 added to it . in the case of flat rotation curve , the potential is written as @xmath56 \\phi_2 ( r ) = -\\varepsilon v_{c}^2 \\ ; / \\ ; 2,\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the circular velocity and @xmath58  is the elongation of the potential . introducing a constant damping term into the equations of motion and considering only the @xmath1 perturbation term (",
    "lindblad & lindblad 1994 ; wada 1994 ) , linear epicyclic approximation of lin & shu ( 1964 ) was applied to obtain an analytical solution for gaseous orbits in this barred potential . since this model",
    "is restricted to @xmath1 perturbation , it affects only the first and third harmonic parameters ( @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "these depend on the amplitude of the damping term ( @xmath59 ) , the ellipticity of the potential ( @xmath58 ) , the corotation radius ( cr ) , and the viewing angle ( @xmath60 ) , where @xmath61 corresponds to end - on view .",
    "we use these analytic harmonic parameters to reconstruct the signatures of prominent non - circular motions in the observed velocity fields .",
    "we build a library of models with varying bar parameters ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and a range of bar sizes ) , viewed from different angles ( @xmath64 ) . the effects of @xmath59 and @xmath58  on the velocity field are predictable . the bar signature is weaker for a larger damping factor and/or a smaller flattening of the potential . however , the effect of varying @xmath60 is not straightforward .    investigating our library of dissipative bar models , we find that only for a certain combination of parameters the model exhibits a strong twist of the gas zero - velocity curve similar to our data ( fig .

    "care has to be taken at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , since there the linear epicyclic theory breaks down . at the ilr , due to the presence of non - linear terms , which are not accounted for by the analytic epicyclic theory , the weak - bar model",

    "this may be indicative of significant outflows in this agn host .",
    "the projected and deprojected pa profiles from laine ( 2002 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmos ] display strong variations in the central few arcseconds .",
    "the hst images display asymmetrically distributed dust within the central few arcsecoonds , which may cause these strong central pa variations ( also found by kornreich 2001 ) . at larger radii , we find that the pa profile shows a variation of the order of @xmath80 , but overall it stays fairly constant around the nominal rc3 value , i.e. @xmath4 . our tilted - ring decomposition of the gaseous velocity field , yields a mean gas kinematic pa of @xmath81 , which is consistent with the photometric pa from rc3 . in the case of the large stellar disk , as described in section  [ sec : stars ]",
    ", we find an offset of @xmath82 between the stellar kinematic pa and the photometric mean pas . this misalignment could be due to the effect of the bar on the observed stellar velocity field .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : sauzoom ] we zoom into the central few arcseconds of the stellar and the gaseous velocity fields of ngc  5448 to emphasize the observed kinematic differences between the two components .",
    "the gaseous component exhibits a strongly twisting zero - velocity curve , and the gas rotates faster than the stars .",
    "we find that the inner stellar disk not only is misaligned with the outer stellar disk , but also is shifted to the south - east .",
    "in contrast , we find from the photometric profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmos ] , that the ellipticity of the central disk is similar to that of the outer disk ( @xmath83 ) , as well as their pas .",
    "the prominent dust lanes at the south of this galaxy may explain the kinematic misalignment between the outer and inner stellar disks .    in the central @xmath84",
    "the gas isovelocity contours are comparatively straight and parallel . in the same region ,",
    "the stellar isovelocity contours are indicative of the presence of a central disk .",
    "the tilted - ring decomposition of the gas velocity field provides the gas rotation curve illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sauzoom ] .",
    "the gas rotates about 70  faster than the stars in the region outside @xmath84 , with some indication that outside this radius the negative velocities reach lower values than the positive line - of - sight velocities .",
    "this asymmetry could be caused by complex dust distribution or attributed to a signature of lopsidedness .",
    "although the unsharp - masked sauron  image shows strong signature of dust - lanes in the region south of the nucleus , the central dust distribution is easier to study when looking at the hst images and the @xmath6 colour map in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmos ] .",
    "the colour map shows a strong dust lane about 1  at the south - east of the galaxy nucleus as well as an asymmetrically distributed overall dust distribution .",
    "the larger scale wfpc2 image shows that this central dust lane is accompanied by several other dust lanes further away from the nucleus .",
    "using the galactic extinction law of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , the hst images yield an average extinction value of @xmath85 over the central 3 , with a maximum value of 1.5 .",
    "the extinction increases significantly towards the centre , with a prominent peak a few arcseconds south of the nucleus ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nicmos ] ) .    some of the observational effects of the asymmetrical dust distribution could be interpreted as signatures of lopsidedness .",
    "lopsidedness in galaxies has been investigated by e.g. , baldwin , lynden - bell & sancisi ( 1980 ) and swaters ( 1999 ) .",
    "the amplitude of this effect may depend on galactocentric radius , and viewed from different viewing angles will produce different signatures in the observed velocity field .",
    "these studies have shown that the residuals are dominated by the zeroth harmonic term for viewing angle of @xmath86 , and by the second harmonic term for viewing angle of @xmath87 . in the special case of radius - dependent lopsidedness @xmath53 .",
    "ngc  5448 has a large inclination , thus the zeroth term dominates , and we find no correlation between the @xmath37 and the @xmath50 terms .",
    "our harmonic decomposition results display strongly varying zeroth and second terms .",
    "this was shown by sfdz to be a poassible indication of an @xmath2 perturbation , i.e. lopsidedness ( c.f . , fig 2 . in sfdz ) . in this case , subtracting the rotational component from the perturbed velocity field , one should find a ring - like feature .",
    "[ fig : residual ] , we present this residual field for ngc  5448 and find no ring - like feature",
    ". therefore dust is most likely the cause for the asymmetric features that we observe in ngc  5448 .      in fig  [ fig : analysis ] , we find that the harmonic parameters derived from the data are consistent with the bar model outlined in section [ sec : n5448bar ] .",
    "our simple model is limited to an @xmath1 perturbation .",
    "complicated flow patterns in bars studied by , e.g. , lindblad ( 1999 ) , imply a significant contribution from @xmath88 and higher - order modes .",
    "the third harmonic terms are also influenced by @xmath88 , which could explain the differences between our model bar and the data for these parameters , but a detailed model is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we now compare the modelled bar with the deprojected digitised sky survey ( dss ) image .",
    "the inclination from the rc3 and the pa from our tilted - ring model were used to deproject the dss image in a simple way by assuming that the galaxy disk is thin .",
    "the outer spiral arms are clearly emphasized in the deprojected dss image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dssimage ] ) .",
    "it is somewhat difficult to identify the size of the large - scale bar from the image . from our bar model",
    "we find a cr of about @xmath89 . in practice",
    ", this is done by assuming that at cr the circular frequency of the axisymmetric potential is identical to bar angular frequency . according to this definition and",
    "since we use a flat rotation curve , the ilr is located at @xmath90 of the cr , i.e. , at about @xmath91 .",
    "if we assume that the bar in ngc  5448 ends close to the starting point of the spiral arms ( sanders & huntley 1976 ) , we can also then associate its cr with the inner radius of the arms .",
    "[ fig : dssimage ] shows that our analytic bar model is of reasonable size .",
    "the assumed cr radius is confirmed by the ellipticity profile presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmos ] , since the high ellipticity plateau starts at around this radius . at around the ilr ( i.e. , @xmath91 )",
    ", there is a good agreement between the @xmath44  profiles from the data and the model , with in both cases a change in sign at the ilr .",
    "we have used linear theory to construct a bar model ( @xmath1 mode ) for ngc  5448 .",
    "the best - fit model considers the effects of a single weak bar with a potential ellipticity @xmath92 and a damping amplitude of @xmath93 .",
    "we compare the harmonic terms of the model with those derived from the data and find an overall consistency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : analysis ] ) . using this model ,",
    "we have been able to associate the radial motion of gas with that of the large - scale bar ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : s3s1 ] ) .",
    "ngc  5448 exhibits clear signatures of the presence of other components than a single bar , which affect the observed velocity field . inspecting the photometry and the central parts of the gaseous and stellar velocity field , we have detected a central rotating disk - like stellar component embedded in the larger disk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diskmodel ] ) .",
    "the wfpc2 image shows one very sharp dust lane 1  from the centre of this galaxy .",
    "this image also shows three more fuzzy and almost parallel dust lanes further out in the south - east direction .",
    "the dusty centre is also apparent in the @xmath6 image in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmos ] .",
    "dust is inhomogeneously distributed and continues down to the very bright nucleus .",
    "light from the central light source is absorbed by the dust asymmetrically and the centre appears to be located at the north - west of its actual position .",
    "investigating the projected and deprojected ellipticity profiles derived from the @xmath35-band data from laine ( 2002 ) confirms the presence of a central disk in the inner 7 .",
    "although the projected ellipticity profile decreases at @xmath84 and outwards , we can not pin down the exact size of the central disk .",
    "the observed ellipticity decrease could be partly caused by the strongly asymmetric dust distribution .",
    "the stellar kinematic maps show that the central disk rotates faster than the main disk , and our observed gas distribution and kinematics indicate that this central disk also hosts gas which rotates faster than its stellar counterpart .",
    "this is not unexpected , since due to its disspative nature , the gas is not slowed down by asymmetric drift .",
    "it is important to note that , in ngc  5448 , the gas velocities are well ordered but larger in magnitude than the stellar velocities .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : sauzoom ] indicates that this velocity difference dies out at larger radii .",
    "the difference between the stellar and gas velocities can be easily explained as due to the fact that the stars are in a thicker structure ( bulge ) in the central regions , while at larger radii both the gas and the stars are in a flatter disk , and both move closer to the circular velocity .    it is known that bars are efficient in transferring mass towards the inner regions of their host galaxies .",
    "the centrally concentrated matter may be able to form a central disk ( yuan & yen 2004 ) , or an inner bar ( e.g. , maciejewski & sparke 2000 , englmaier & shlosman 2004 ) .",
    "our analysis has shown that the non - circular gas kinematics in ngc  5448 could be driven by the large - scale bar .",
    "the central disk could then have been formed as a result of the gas accumulation at the centre .    to conclude",
    ", we have been able to analytically model the bar signatures in the agn host ngc  5448 .",
    "we have unveiled a central disk , and have distinguished the effects of a lopsided perturbation from strong dust features . ngc",
    "5448 hosts considerable amounts of dust which is asymmetrically distributed all the way to the centre , resembling the `` evil eye '' galaxy ( braun , walterbos & kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "this study shows the power of the harmonic decomposition formalism to quantify non - circular motions in observed velocity fields , and we plan to apply this approach to the full set of bulges observed with sauron .",
