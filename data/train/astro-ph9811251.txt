    "over the past few years , cosmologists have emphasized that measurements of the two - point correlation function of cmb anisotropies can yield a wealth of information about physical conditions in the early universe . in this article , we will discuss how non - linear physics can produce a detectable non - gaussian signature in the microwave background .",
    "we concentrate on cases in which gravitational lensing between here and the surface of last scatter couple via a limber s equation to produce a non - gaussian signal .",
    "the amplitude of this signal is sensitive to the evolution of gravitational potential fluctuations at low redshift .",
    "thus , measurements of the non - gaussianity will complement measurements of the two point correlation function by providing information about physical conditions in the low - redshift universe .    in  2",
    ", we discuss cross - correlating the effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect and cross - correlating the effects of gravitational lensing with the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effects . because there are equal numbers of hot and cold spots",
    ", gravitational lensing alone does not produce a detectable three - point signal@xcite .",
    "however , the combination of lensing with other low redshift effects will produce an observable non - gaussian signature . in  3 , we compute the signal / noise for this effect and discuss these cosmological applications .",
    "a companion paper@xcite provides a more general discussion of the bispectrum , including derivation of the angle - averaged bispectrum , a method for measuring the bispectrum and estimating the signal to noise , and a fully worked example of the bispectrum produced by the rees - sciama effect .",
    "the angle - averaged bispectrum is the spherical harmonic transform of the temperature three point function , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is defined as the temperature anisotropy ( with mean zero ) at a particular point in the sky .",
    "we expand the temperature out into three terms : @xmath2 where the first term is the cmb  fluctuations from the surface of last scatter , the second term describes the effects of lensing and the third term describes the effects of secondary processes at low redshift .",
    "we shall assume throughout this paper that the third term is first order ( e.g. @xmath3 ) , but clearly , second order secondary processes would also give rise to an observable bispectrum , as is the case with the rees - sciama effect considered in the companion paper@xcite .",
    "for this article , we will consider two sources of secondary anisotropy ( both of which are first order ) , the isw effect and the sunyaev- zeldovich effect .    combining equations ( [ threept ] ) and ( [ threeterms ] ) yields , @xmath4 plus an additional 5 terms representing the various permutations of the observation angles .",
    "we can immediately integrate over @xmath5 : @xmath6 we may note that by integrating by parts : @xmath7 where the surface integrals drop out , since we are integrating over a complete unit sphere . combining this expression , with similar expressions involving the laplacian of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we find : @xmath10t_{lr}(\\hat{\\bf n } ) \\right > \\label{bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are scalar quantities , their expectation value will depend only on their spatial separation : @xmath13 inserting equation ( [ corr ] ) into equation ( [ bb ] ) and integrating yields , @xmath14 plus 5 additional terms , reflecting the various permutations of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if the universe is not flat with @xmath18 , then at late times , gravitational potential fluctuations decay .",
    "this decay generates additional microwave background fluctuations : @xmath19 where the gravitational potential fluctuations have been expanded out in fourier space , @xmath20 is the direction of photon propagation , and @xmath21 is conformal ( comoving ) lookback time .",
    "if a line - of - sight passes primarily through high density regions , then it will be on average hotter than lines - of - sight that pass primarily through low density regions .",
    "foreground fluctuations in the gravitational potential also distort the photon geodesics , @xmath22 this effect is surprisingly large ; a typical photon s trajectory has been deflected roughly several arcminutes from its initial path .    by measuring the three - point function , we can cross - correlate these two effects , @xmath23 where we have used the rayleigh expansion of the fourier mode into spherical harmonics : @xmath24    since most of the contribution to the integral comes from when @xmath25 , we approximate @xmath26 by its value at that time and then integrate over @xmath27 : @xmath28 in our analysis , we compute this integral numerically up to @xmath29 .",
    "however , for large @xmath30 , we can evaluate this integral quickly by noting that @xmath31 , yielding : @xmath32 to illustrate the behavior of this coefficient , figure  [ fg : b_l ] shows a plot of @xmath33 versus @xmath30 for an @xmath34 , @xmath35 cosmology .",
    "filaments , groups , and clusters will distort the microwave background through both the sz effect and gravitational lensing@xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the effect depends upon the integrated pressure fluctuations along the line - of - sight , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the thompson cross - section , @xmath38 is the electron mass and @xmath39 is the fluctuations in electron pressure .",
    "the electron pressure is the product of the electron density and the electron temperature . on large scales , we parameterize this as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the gas bias factor ( which is expected to be @xmath42 as dense regions are hotter than low density regions @xcite ) , @xmath43 is the mean gas pressure and @xmath44 is the fluctuation in the dark matter density .",
    "this approximation only holds on scales in which linear theory holds .",
    "however , as we will show , the sz - lensing bispectrum probes scales of @xmath45 . numerical simulations",
    "( r. cen , private communication ) find that the density weighted temperature , @xmath46 kev for @xmath47 .",
    "since the gas density falls as @xmath48 , the pressure drops roughly as @xmath49 . based on this ,",
    "we approximate the large scale sz fluctuations as , @xmath50 where @xmath51 . for a flat universe with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 @xmath54 kev , @xmath55 .",
    "this approximation is likely to be valid on scales larger than the non - linear scale .",
    "we can relate the dark matter density to the potential and rewrite equation ( [ sz ] ) , @xmath56 and now compute the @xmath57 cross - correlation term : @xmath58 as @xmath30 gets large , the spherical bessel functions can be treated as approximating delta functions such that : @xmath59 making this approximation for @xmath60 and integrating from @xmath61 to @xmath62 yields : @xmath63    this may be further simplified by making the same approximation for @xmath64 and integrating over @xmath65 : @xmath66 note that for very small values of @xmath21 ( low redshift ) , @xmath67 , and the kernel of the above equation goes to 0 .",
    "it is only in the large wavelength regime in which @xmath68 where the integral is maximized .",
    "this occurs around @xmath69 for most cosmological models , and thus , the assumption that pressure and density perturbations are proportional and evolve linearly are well motivated .",
    "as figure  [ fg : b_l ] shows , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect dominates over the isw effect at large @xmath30 .",
    "since the sz effect is enhanced by non - linear evolution , the estimated signal in equation ( [ szeq ] ) is likely an underestimate , numerical simulations , complemented by improved analytical techniques , will be needed to more accurately compute the signal .",
    "it may be thought that @xmath33 will merely change normalization with a change of @xmath70 , and thus , @xmath71 ( which clearly only affects the normalization ) and @xmath70 would be indistinguishable .",
    "since there is little variation in @xmath72 for variations of @xmath70 , it might be thought that the bispectrum _ shape _ will be roughly constant , and thus , only the normalization could be extracted . in figure",
    "[ fg : b_l_omega ] , we show that this is not the case . for variations in @xmath70",
    ", we see that @xmath33 varies not only in normalization , but in shape as well , and thus , both @xmath71 and @xmath70 will be able to be extracted almost independently .",
    "will we be able to detect either effect ? we can estimate this by determining whether in a @xmath73 universe , we can use the map data to reject the hypothesis that there is no non - gaussianity in the cmb maps : @xmath74 where we restrict the sum to @xmath75 . for our standard set of parameters , @xmath76 with most of the signal coming from the sz effect .",
    "thus , measuring the bispectrum will enable us to measure @xmath77 and probe the time evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "in figure  [ fg : chi2_omega ] , we plot the value of @xmath78 for the isw - lensing bispectrum for flat models with varying @xmath70 and @xmath79 . as shown in the figure",
    ", the planck@xcite satellite will do an excellent job differentiating between the null hypothesis and a given value of @xmath70 , giving a 4 @xmath80 signal for @xmath81 .",
    "the map satellite , however , will be unable to differentiate between the two .    likewise , this method will be able to potentially probe different equations of state . while the cosmological constant behaves as a component with @xmath82 ( our fiducial model ) ,",
    "different equations of state produce dramatically different rates of potential growth , and hence , we may measure the @xmath78 difference between test values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as shown in figure  [ fg : chi2_isw_w ] . note that both map and planck provide constraints on @xmath83 at the 1 @xmath80 level ; planck gives @xmath85 , and map gives @xmath86 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fg : chi2_omega ] , map will be sensitive to this effect as well , and the 4 year results will yield 1 @xmath80 uncertainties of @xmath87 .",
    "planck can distinguish sz from cmb fluctuations , so it will be very sensitive to this effect as well .",
    "however , calculating its signal to noise is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "figure  [ fg : dchi2 ] shows the additional @xmath78 for a mode with a given value of @xmath17 ( by convention , the largest index ) .",
    "note that the maximal contribution occurs near @xmath88 for planck .",
    "though the sz - lensing effect is generally at higher mode numbers ( see the comparison between the signals as will be detectable by map ) , it will nevertheless produce a much stronger signal in map than will the isw - lensing effect , since at high @xmath30 ( but less than 600 ) , the sz - lensing coefficient ( @xmath33 ) dwarfs the coefficient for the isw - lensing effect ( see figure  [ fg : b_l ] ) .    in this article , we estimated the non - gaussian signature produced by the combined effects of gravitational lensing and the isw effect and the combined effects of gravitational lensing and the sz effect . for most cosmological models ,",
    "the sz signature is stronger and will swamp the isw effect signal . detecting",
    "the sz - lensing cross - correlation will determine the mean density of ionized gas in the today s universe .",
    "thus , map should be able to detect the ",
    "missing baryons\"@xcite .    by cross - correlating the map data with observations of large scale structure and x - ray maps",
    ", we can look for additional signatures of low redshift physics .",
    "previous papers have discussed cross - correlating the galaxy distribution in the sloan survey with the temperature maps to look for gravitational lensing effects@xcite and for the sunyaev - zeldovich produced by both clusters and superclusters@xcite .",
    "boughn et al.@xcite have looked for cross - correlations between the cosmic x - ray and microwave backgrounds in an attempt to detect the late - time isw effect . combining these different cross - correlations will enable cosmologists to determine the relationship between the mass distribution and the distribution of gas and galaxies .",
    "these observations will also probe the time evolution of the gravitational potential and provide a new tool for measuring the basic cosmological parameters .",
