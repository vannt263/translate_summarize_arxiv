    "a large - scale study of the milky way is important to our general understanding of galaxy structure and formation .",
    "it is only in our own ` backyard ' that great numbers of stars , the building block of all galaxies , may be observed individually , with their collective properties serving as constraints on theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "spectroscopic data of individual stars can provide a much richer variety of information on both stellar kinematics and stellar atmospheric parameters than is possible with photometric measurements alone .    the first large area spectroscopic surveys used objective prism plates , including the fundamental surveys for spectroscopic classification @xcite and more specialized surveys for unusual stars @xcite .",
    "later objective prism surveys focused on extremely metal - poor stars @xcite and on halo giants @xcite .",
    "objective prism surveys had the advantage of rapidly recording a large number of stellar spectra over significant solid angles , but had disadvantages such as a bright limiting magnitude and an inability to accurately calibrate the spectra .",
    " aperture \" spectroscopic surveys using modern spectrographs have been rarer , in part because of the huge investment of telescope time required to assemble substantial - sized samples .",
    "they include the  spaghetti \" survey for halo giants @xcite , the sim grid giant star survey @xcite , the detailed chemical study of @xcite and its various sequels , and the monumental survey of @xcite who studied nearby , bright f and g stars and obtained metallicity , temperature and age information from strmgren photometry and accurate radial velocities ( rvs ) from coravel and other spectrographs .    multiobject spectroscopic surveys ( first implemented with plug boards , or slit masks , then with automated positioners ) , which provide a large gain in efficiency , have also been done with specific scientific goals in mind . a number of programs @xcite have searched for coherent structures in the halo .",
    "the rave survey @xcite , which focuses on bright stars of all colors ( @xmath13 ) , produces accurate velocities and estimates of stellar parameters from a small spectral region including the ca ii infrared ( ir ) triplet .",
    "orthogonal to the volume - limited or spectral - type specific surveys have been the compilations of homogeneous spectroscopic atlases of a few hundred objects @xcite obtained with electronic scanners and imaging tubes .",
    "the members of these catalogs were selected to sample objects of all spectral types with at least one example of each temperature and luminosity class .",
    "these catalogs do not give relative numbers of stars in the different spectral categories , however , and they may miss some rare categories , especially the low - metallicity stars .",
    "looking to the future , the gaia spaced - based mission @xcite plans to obtain proper motions ( and precise positions ) of approximately one billion stars to @xmath14 , with rvs for all of the brighter objects with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "gaia , when underway , will represent a several orders of magnitude leap forward in our knowledge of the kinematics , structure and evolution of our galaxy .      the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) is primarily an extragalactic survey that has obtained 2% multicolor imaging of nearly 8000 @xmath16 of filled contiguous sky toward the northern galactic cap , and 700 @xmath16 in three stripes in the south galactic cap near the celestial equator .",
    "spectra have been acquired of one million galaxies and one hundred thousand quasars .",
    "the major science program consists of constructing a large three - dimensional map of the universe and constraining cosmological models ; see , e.g. @xcite .    a significant product of the sdss was a large number of milky way stellar spectra combined with deep , accurate multicolor photometry .",
    "this led to several ( initially ) serendipitous galactic structure , galactic halo , and m31 halo science results ; see @xcite .",
    "near the conclusion of the original sdss program in 2004 , partially as a result of the productive galactic science enabled by the sdss , a set of three individual surveys ( under the umbrella designation of sdss - ii ) were designed : 1 ) legacy : a survey following the same goals of the original sdss , to complete the sdss imaging and spectroscopic footprint ; 2 ) sn ia @xcite : a well - calibrated , systematic survey for 200 intermediate redshift ( @xmath17 ) type ia supernovae , filling an important gap in redshift coverage , and anchoring the calibrations of higher redshift supernova surveys ; and 3 ) sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) , an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the milky way and its surrounding halo .",
    "sdss - ii operated from 2005 august to 2008 july at apache point observatory , building on sdss , which operated from 2000 august until 2005 july .",
    "the segue survey is the subject of this paper .",
    "the processed , searchable data archive from segue was made publicly available in the fall of 2008 as part of sdss - ii data release 7 ( dr7 ) . with few exceptions ,",
    "all stellar spectral types are represented in the segue survey .",
    "notable categories which are missing include luminous population i early types , such as o , b , and wolf - rayet stars , and some population i giants , which are not targeted because they are generally too bright for segue observations if they are in the solar neighborhood and are too rare or are obscured by dust toward the galactic center to be seen at greater distances .",
    "samples of spectrophotometrically calibrated stars of a wide variety of spectral types are presented in section  3 .",
    "a defining part of segue is the creation and release of its public database that can be mined to enable a whole range of astrophysics projects not conceived of when the survey was carried out .",
    "the original , five year sdss program demonstrated the existence of significant spatial substructure in the stellar halo of the milky way discovered from photometric data , from which stellar distance estimates were obtained primarily for bluer ( a and f ) stars .",
    "these substructures cast doubt upon previous measurements of a presumed axially symmetric spheroid stellar component of the galaxy with a smoothly varying power law density structure .",
    "discovery of the substructure also created a tremendous need for follow - up spectroscopy of each structure , so that stellar population and orbital information for the debris could be determined .",
    "segue was designed to sample the stellar spheroid at a variety of distances , from a few kpc to a hundred kpc , in 200  pencil beams , \" spaced around the sky so that they would intersect the largest structures . at the time segue",
    "was designed , we knew about the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal tidal debris stream and the controversial monoceros stream in the galactic plane .",
    "both structures were 610 kpc across and were believed to extend all of the way around the milky way .",
    "we expected that additional substructure would be discovered , and that it was most important to identify and characterize the largest structures ; without knowledge of the spatial variation of the spheroid at 10 kpc scales , it was difficult to positively identify smaller or lower surface brightness structures .",
    "segue augmented the photometric data from the sdss / legacy surveys to sample the sky about every 15@xmath18 across the sky , in all parts of the sky accessible from the telescope s latitude .",
    "this included adding photometry at low latitudes ( @xmath19 ) and additional photometry in the south galactic cap .",
    "two hundred pencil beams were selected for spectroscopy because these could be arranged to sample the sky at intervals of 10@xmath18 to 15@xmath18 , and two observations of each pencil beam could be observed in the three year duration of sdss - ii .",
    "spectroscopic target selection was designed to maximize the science from segue stellar spectroscopy ; in particular we wished to study the milky way s chemical and dynamic formation history and to constrain the galaxy s gravitational potential .",
    "the target selection strategy that was used to achieve these general goals devoted most of the fibers on each pencil beam line of sight to sampling the stellar populations of the galaxy on large ( tens of kpc ) scales , including spheroid substructure and global properties of the thin and thick disk components .",
    "in addition , a small subset of the fibers was devoted to unusual stars , including those thought to have low metallicity ( [ m / h ] @xmath20 ) or to be otherwise unusual based on their colors and velocities ( as determined by photometry and proper motions ) .",
    "in addition , we specifically targeted star clusters with a variety of ages and metallicities so that this important spectral database could be well calibrated .    to meet these goals , segue has produced 1 ) an imaging survey of 3500 @xmath16 of @xmath9 imaging with the sdss telescope and camera @xcite , 2 ) a spectroscopic catalog that spans the stellar population observable in magnitude and galactic latitude range of the data at a resolution of @xmath21 .",
    "the spectroscopic catalog includes estimates for the observational parameters ( position , rv , multicolor photometric and spectrophotometric magnitudes ) , as well as the derived , modeled parameters ( including @xmath22 $ ] , surface gravity , and @xmath23 ) for all observed stars in a systematic and well - calibrated fashion .",
    "the original sdss imaged most of the north galactic cap plus three stripes of data in the south galactic cap ; regions of low galactic latitude ( @xmath19 ) were largely excluded by design .",
    "the segue imaging footprint was designed to allow the selection of spectroscopic targets in as broad a range of sky directions as possible , to enable study of the important transition zones between our milky way s disks and stellar halo , to include a large and varied sample of galactic star clusters that could be used for calibration , and to ensure that photometric calibration would be feasible ( i.e. avoid zones of extreme and variable extinction ) .",
    "the low - latitude segue imaging area includes 15 2.5@xmath18-wide stripes of data along constant galactic longitude , spaced by approximately @xmath24 around the sky .",
    "these stripe probe the galaxy at a wide variety of longitudes , sampling the changing relative densities of global galactic components ( thin disk , thick disk , halo ) .",
    "the precise longitudes of the segue stripes are not evenly spaced ; the @xmath25 of several stripes were shifted by up to @xmath26 , so that several known open clusters near the galactic plane could be optically imaged .",
    "we added two stripes of data in the south galactic cap . because spectra of stars toward cardinal galactic directions ( @xmath25 near @xmath27 ) are important for generating a simplified kinematic analysis of a very complex dynamic galaxy , the two segue stripes ( at @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) that nearly coincide with cardinal pointings were extended to give nearly complete pole - to - pole imaging and more complete spectroscopic plate coverage than at other longitudes . where possible , the segue stripes were designed to cross other sdss imaging data at multiple locations to facilitate photometric calibration .",
    "figure 1 shows the constant longitude and two southern imaging stripes chosen to augment the original sdss footprint in equatorial ( top ) and galactic coordinates ( bottom ) .",
    "we sample the sky in all directions that are accessible to the apache point observatory ; since the observatory is at a northern latitude of @xmath30 , essentially no segue data is obtained with the equatorial coordinates @xmath31 .",
    "the galactic anticenter ( @xmath32 ) is well sampled , but the galactic center ( @xmath33 ) is not .",
    "the stellar population of the bulge is largely inaccessible and obscured by dust in this optical survey .",
    "the segue imaging scans ( i.e. , data not associated with the legacy sdss survey ) are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "all segue imaging was obtained between 2004 august and 2008 january .",
    "note that each segue stripe is @xmath34 wide .",
    "stripes 72 and 79 follow standard numbering conventions of the original sdss imaging survey . stripes with four digit numbers",
    "run along constant @xmath25 , running for variable extents in @xmath35 .",
    "the formula for converting the sdss survey coordinates @xmath36 for a particular node and inclination to the equatorial coordinates j2000 @xmath37 may be found in @xcite .    except in regions of high stellar density ,",
    "the processing and calibration of the segue imaging data are the same as that of the sdss imaging data @xcite . a modified version of the sdss photo processing pipeline software ( r. h. lupton et al . , 2010 in preparation",
    ") was combined with the pan - starrs @xcite object detection code , and was run on all lower latitude segue imaging scans .",
    "the key modifications were : 1 ) the photo code was optimized for primarily stellar objects by truncating fits to the wings of extended sources at essentially the point - spread function ( psf ) radius , 2 ) the photo code s object deblender was allowed to deblend groups of closely spaced objects into more ` child ' objects than in standard high latitude ( less crowded ) sdss fields , and 3 ) pan - starrs threshold object detection code was used .",
    "this code generates more complete object lists in regions of high stellar density , and was used to supplement photo s object detector .",
    "imaging scans which participated in this low - latitude processing are tagged in the data archive with a rerun ( reprocessing version ) number of 648 .",
    "this is in contrast to standard sdss and segue photo reprocessing numbers @xmath38 . except in regions of high stellar density ,",
    "the magnitudes from this version of photo are interchangeable ( within the errors ) with the version used to process the rest of the sdss and segue imaging data . at high stellar density",
    "the choice depends on the needs of the particular investigation .",
    "both the photo psf magnitudes and the pan - starrs aperture magnitudes are available for comparison in the dr7 data archive for low latitude regions of sky .",
    "we refer the reader to the dr7 paper @xcite for more discussion of this reprocessing of the imaging data , and to the documentation on the dr7 web site . at the density extreme ,",
    "several globular clusters present in the sdss and segue footprints are analyzed by @xcite using independent software ( see below ) .",
    "as in sdss dr6 @xcite , the zeropoint photometric calibration segue imaging has been enhanced by the calibration procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this procedure finds a simultaneous global fit for the individual imaging scans photometric zeropoints , extinction coefficients and flat - field characteristics ( of all 30 sdss camera ccds ) , relying on the overlap between segue and sdss legacy scans to improve the absolute zeropoints accuracies in the @xmath39 filters to @xmath40 in most areas around the sky .",
    "segue leveraged the unique features of the sdss telescope and spectrographs ( namely the ability to go deep and wide , with broad spectral coverage and high spectrophotometric accuracy ) to acquire spectra of @xmath41 240,000 stars of a wide variety of spectral types ( from white dwarfs ( wds ) on the blue end to m and l subdwarfs on the red end ) , probing a wide range of distances ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the sdss spectrographs used for segue are a pair of highly efficient dual ccd camera , fiber - fed spectrographs , with wavelength coverage from 3900  to 9000   at resolving power @xmath21 .",
    "the twin spectrographs can simultaneously record data from 640 fibers in a 7 @xmath16 field of view ; 7%  12% of the fibers are reserved for sky signal and other calibration fibers ( such as spectrophotometric standard stars , generally chosen from color - selected f subdwarfs with @xmath43 ) .",
    "segue took spectra of stars in the magnitude range @xmath44 . at @xmath45",
    "the sdss spectrographs saturate in a 300 second exposure .",
    "objects down to @xmath46 can be routinely obtained with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath47 30 , sufficient for rvs good to 4 @xmath48 and metallicity @xmath49 $ ] measurements accurate to 0.2 dex for a wide variety of spectral types ( a - k ) .",
    "at @xmath50 we were able to obtain @xmath51 in 2 hours integration time under photometric conditions with seeing of @xmath52 or better ( all s / n quotations are per @xmath53 resolution element ) .",
    "spectroscopic plate pointings sparsely sample all areas of the sky with available imaging ( figure 1 ) , probing all the major known galactic structures ( thin and thick disk , halo , and streams ) with the exception of the bulge , which is below our southern declination limit . to study the detailed structure of these galactic components ,",
    "the density of targets is made high enough that the velocity distribution of one homogeneous subset of stars ( the g dwarfs ) in one distance bin ( an interval of one apparent magnitude ) may be determined to be either consistent or distinct from a gaussian .",
    "this requires at least 40 targets of one spectral type ( g dwarfs ) per magnitude interval ( 14th through 20th ) per plate pointing .",
    "it is this scientific goal which drives the assignment of over 300 fibers per plate pair to g star candidates toward each segue line of sight .",
    "the required rv accuracy is driven by the scientific goal of separating stellar streams with dispersion @xmath54 from field disk and halo stars with dispersions of @xmath55 30 and 100 @xmath56 respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the actual relative rv accuracy obtained from segue spectra using quality assurance ( qa ) stars .",
    "these are simply stars at @xmath57 that are observed twice , once on each of the two plates that make a complete observation of a segue pencil beam .",
    "there are @xmath58 such pairs for every pencil beam .",
    "we restrict our qa sample to those with @xmath59 .",
    "rvs are measured by cross - correlating each spectrum against a set of @xmath60 selected templates taken from the elodie high resolution spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "the elodie templates span a wide range of spectral types and metallicities . very early and",
    "very late types , however , are nearly absent .",
    "we note that the correlation is done by shifting each spectrum repeatedly , stepping through wavelength space ( rather then via fast fourier transform techniques ) , and , while time consuming , this appears to result in somewhat higher accuracy .",
    "the top panel shows the measured rv difference histogram between all qa stars and a second observation of the same stars on a different plate .",
    "individual errors are @xmath61 .",
    "the lower panel shows how the rv accuracy degrades with color and s / n : in general bluer objects have worse rv errors than red , with blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) and their broad balmer lines being hardest to measure accurately .",
    "we expand on the content of figure 2 in table 2 , where we order the set of spectra with multiple independent observations of the same object by s / n and divide the data for each of the six color ranges into four quartiles .",
    "for each color range from blue to red , we tabulate n and list by quartile the average ( dereddened ) magnitude @xmath62 , average s / n and the @xmath63 velocity error ( divided by @xmath64 to compensate for the fact that we have two independent measurements ) .",
    "the errors are well behaved as s / n decreases from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "we do not characterize velocity errors for extreme spectral types ( wds on the blue end and late m and l type stars on the red end ) , as these samples have very large systematic errors , due to very broad spectral features and a lack of standard templates with which to cross - correlate .",
    "follow - up reductions of the segue spectra will include synthetic templates for deriving velocities for stars with unusual carbon enhancement ( s. thirupathi , 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "one component of the total rv error is the systematic error in zeropoint of each plate .",
    "the scatter in that offset between plates , measured from the mean offset of the qa stars for each pencil beam , has zero mean and standard deviation 1.8 @xmath67 .",
    "this scatter of 1.8 @xmath67 contributes to the rv uncertainty of all segue stars , and sets the lower bound of our rv errors .",
    "to check the overall zeropoint of the rv calibration we used a set of 100 bright field stars observed both with segue and at higher resolution on the hobby - eberly telescope @xcite .",
    "segue spectra of stars in the outskirts of globular clusters with known rv also provided checks on the rv zeropoint .",
    "this analysis resulted in an offset of 7.3 km / s with very small scatter .",
    "this 7.3 km / s offset was applied to segue rvs ( but not to the @xmath68 redshift measurements directly from the spectroscopic pipelines ) in the final dr7 catalog .",
    "the origin of these systematics are not completely understood , but they are thought to be associated with telescope flexure or night sky line fitting errors when computing wavelength solutions for each merged segue plate , which consists of a numbers of exposures taken over several hours , often spanning multiple nights ( see below ) .",
    "our scientific goals require that for a large fraction of the stars with @xmath69 , sufficient s / n be obtained so it is possible to reliably estimate the metallicities @xmath70 $ ] and luminosity classes ( dwarf vs. subgiant vs. giant ) for stars of spectral types a - m well enough to separate stream stars from field disk populations from halo populations .",
    "an s / n @xmath7 is required to measure these stellar atmospheric parameters , with more accurate measurements at higher s / n .",
    "this drove the integration time for the sdss spectrographs to about 2 hours for a @xmath71 object and 1 hour for a @xmath72 object .    the actual segue spectroscopic survey selected pointings are shown as blue circles in figure 1 .",
    "there are 212 segue pointings on the sky , all listed in table 3 .",
    "these pointings are divided into the following categories : 1 ) ` survey ' , 172 approximately evenly spaced pointings around the sdss and segue imaging area , separated by no more than @xmath24 from the next nearest pointing , sampling all directions without regard for known structures or streams .",
    "2 ) ` llsurvey ' , 12 pointings at low latitude , where a separate target selection algorithm is used that functions even in highly reddened lines of sight ; 3 ) ` strm ' , 16 pointings toward five previously discovered stream - like structures around the halo of the milky way , such as the sagittarius or orphan streams ; 4 ) ` cluster ' , 12 pointings towards known globular or open clusters of known @xmath70 $ ] for purposes of calibrating the metallicity and luminosity pipelines and 5 ) ` test ' , five early segue pointings to test the target selection algorithms at a variety of latitudes and to test the rv accuracy of the survey . six pointings are duplicated .",
    "note that a significant fraction of segue spectroscopy relies upon the sdss legacy survey imaging in the north galactic cap .    a segue ( and sdss )",
    "spectroscopic plate is a circular disk of machined aluminum , with a diameter of @xmath73 m , corresponding to an angular on - the - sky radius of @xmath74 .",
    "a small hole , holding one fiber , is drilled at the position of each object of interest .",
    "each plate may have up to 640 object holes , which are fed to twin 320-fiber spectrographs .",
    "target holes are restricted to being no closer together than @xmath75 on the sky @xcite .",
    "the total area of each plate is approximately 7 @xmath16 on the sky .    because there are many more than 640 stars per 7 @xmath16 to g=20.3 and because the segue magnitude limits @xmath76 span more than a factor of 100 in apparent brightness",
    ", we observe each segue pointing with two sdss - style plates , each with a maximum of 640 fibers .",
    "recall that for sdss extragalactic observations , only one plate at each position was designed , to match the sampling of approximately 100 galaxies per square degree for objects with @xmath77 .",
    "one plate of the pair is called the segue bright ( or segue regular ) plate , and consists of holes targeting stars with @xmath78 , exposed for typically 1 hr . the bright magnitude limit is set by the saturation of the spectrographs for a 300  s exposure , as well as cross - talk considerations between the brightest and faintest objects in adjacent fibers on a given plate .",
    "the second plate of 640 fibers , designated the segue faint plate , primarily consists of stars with @xmath79 , exposed for a total of typically 2 hr .",
    "about 20 stars per pointing with @xmath80 are targeted twice , on both the bright and faint plates .",
    "these objects are called qa objects , and , as mentioned above , are used to determine the systematic reproducibility of rvs and other derived parameters from plate to plate .    for the special case of ` cluster ' plates , where it is desired to obtain spectra of bright nearby globular cluster giant branch stars for calibration ,",
    "the sdss spectrograph saturation limit is extended by taking short ( 12 minute ) exposures , allowing one to sample stars as bright as @xmath81 .",
    "these short exposures , however , have little sky signal , and it is thus difficult to do an accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "this is because the final step in the calibration process depends on using the positions of fixed , known night sky lines such as hg , na and [ o i ] ) .",
    "the bright plates have 32 fibers reserved for blank sky and 16 reserved for spectrophotometric standards ; the faint plates have 64 fibers reserved for blank sky and 16 fibers reserved for spectrophotometric standards .",
    "this approach leaves approximately 1152 fibers available for science targets in each 7 @xmath16 pointing .",
    "the number of sky fibers was determined by the need to maximize target s / n in fiber - fed multiobject spectrographs , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the spectrophotometric standards ( primarily halo f subdwarfs ) from segue and the sdss survey constitute a valuable sample in themselves for numerous galactic structure studies @xcite .",
    "altogether , there are 416 plates in the segue database ; all but 17 of the 212 segue pointings have a bright and faint plate of @xmath82 targets each .",
    "individual 1030 minute exposures were obtained , sometimes on successive nights , until the desired s / n for each segue plate was reached .",
    "all common exposures for a given plate and plugging ( fibers are plugged into the metal plates by hand and the plugged plates can be moved into and out of the focal plane as many times as necessary to reach a desired s / n value ) were combined and uniquely identified by four digit plate number and by the modified julian date ( mjd ) of the last night on which a given plate - plugging was observed . the plate names and identifying observation dates ( mjds ) are all in table 3 .",
    "the total number of unique segue spectra is approximately 240,000 .",
    "segue spectra are processed with the same basic pipelines used to process the sdss data @xcite .",
    "the pipelines have been modified slightly to enhance the radial velocity accuracy of stellar spectra .",
    "it should be noted that a handful of segue plates were obtained under moon illumination fractions of greater than 0.85 , and a careful analysis indicates that the wavelength solutions of these 10 plates are systematically off by as much as @xmath83 .",
    "these plates are marked in table 3 with asterisks .",
    "in addition to the standard extraction and rv reduction pipelines of sdss , the segue plates have been processed through an additional ` segue stellar parameters pipeline ' ( sspp ) that estimates the metallicity @xmath70 $ ] , surface gravity ( @xmath84 ) and effective temperature @xmath85 , along with associated errors , for each star with sufficient s / n . details of the design , operation and error analysis of the sspp as run on segue spectra are described in @xcite and @xcite . the uncertainties in the sspp parameters",
    "were determined by analysis of star clusters with known metallicities , reddenings , and distances and by comparison of sspp - derived parameters with parameters derived from higher resolution spectra of the same sample of field stars .",
    "for spectra with @xmath86 , which are usually obtained for stars with @xmath69 , the errors are @xmath87 ) \\sim 0.2 $ ] dex , @xmath88 dex , and @xmath89 k. these uncertainties are valid for stars with @xmath23 between 4500 k and 8500 k. for stars outside this temperature range , and for stars of lower @xmath90 , atmospheric parameters are still computed , but with appropriately higher error estimates .",
    "table 4 contains a list of sspp quality flags which are set for every spectrum .",
    "these flags , when set , indicate something unusual about a given spectrum , i.e. one with unusually strong balmer , mg or na lines , or one where there is a mismatch between the photometric color [ derived from the @xmath91 color ] , and the spectroscopic type of the star . within the context of dr7 ,",
    "a practical quality cut used to select only stars ( and avoid galaxies , quasars , and low - s / n spectra of the sky ) is to insist that a given spectrum has the error on the elodie template cross - correlation rv @xmath92 strictly @xmath93 .",
    "segue targets are selected primarily from photometry in the @xmath9 sdss filter system @xcite . for a few categories ( cool wd , k giant , and m subdwarf candidates ) , the presence ( or absence ) and amplitude of a proper motion measurement from a match to an astrometric catalog @xcite is also used .",
    "the broad science goal of characterizing large - scale stellar structures in the galaxy , combined with the specific goal of studying halo streams , informed the target selection algorithms design .",
    "the additional goals of finding rare but scientifically interesting samples of objects of unusually low metallicity , odd spectral type , or extreme kinematics were also factors .",
    "the variety of science goals dictated a target selection algorithm that sampled stars at a variety of distances , favoring those at large distances .",
    "the segue survey targets objects at a variety of colors and apparent magnitudes to probe distances from 10 pc ( with wds and m and k dwarfs ) to the outer halo at @xmath94 kpc ( with bhb and red k giant stars ) . at intermediate distances ,",
    "a target selection category denoted ` g star ' ( which contains some g iv subgiants ) is sampled over the entire segue magnitude range @xmath95 , and effectively probes the thick disk to inner halo transition region around the galaxy with a large , unbiased sample .",
    "segue targets were divided into 15 different target categories , which spanned the range from the bluest ( wd ) to reddest ( spectral type l brown dwarfs ) .",
    "table 5 lists the sdss / segue primary target bit in hexadecimal in column 3",
    ". a search of the database may be done for objects with primtarget matching these bits in the specobjall table of the cas ( see below ) .",
    "the fourth column of table 5 lists the magnitude , color , and proper motion cuts for each target type .",
    "when more stars than fibers in a given category are available for targeting , weighting mechanisms are used to subselect from candidates within a given category .",
    "these weighting mechanisms generally were designed to randomly subselect from all possible stars in a given category in a given 7 @xmath16 field , with the probability of selection weighted by either magnitude ( favoring brighter objects over fainter ) or by color ( favoring blue objects over red , except in the case of k giants ) .",
    "the colors used for target selection were in some cases generalized linear combinations of the sdss @xmath9 generated colors .",
    "these generalized colors were designed to run parallel to or perpendicular to the color - color space stellar locus of ( dereddened ) galactic stars @xcite .",
    "there is a maximum number of targets accepted in any given pointing in each category ( see column 5 of table 5 which lists the maximum number of targets allowed per pointing , the approximate total number targeted by category during segue , and a rough estimate of the fraction of the spectra in each category that turn out to be of the type that was targeted ) .",
    "the segue target selection algorithms were not perfected immediately , and for some of the categories , several versions of the algorithm exist , as indicated in column 2 of table 5 .",
    "the final version of segue target selection is designated v4.6 , with earlier revisions having lower version numbers .",
    "the significant changes from earlier versions of the target selection cuts for each target type are tabulated , also in table 5 .",

    "in general , colors of all objects are dereddened by their full @xcite extinction value before applying the various target selection cuts described in table 5 and below .",
    "exceptions to this are the white dwarf / main - sequence ( wd / ms ) binary , the esdm , and the legacy brown dwarf and legacy wd categories , where applying the full dust correction , assuming the star lies behind the dust screen , is not correct , and thus uncorrected colors are preferred .    for each pointing , candidate lists of all objects which match the color and reduced proper motion cuts for each of the 15 categories are generated .",
    "each of the 15 candidate lists is then sorted , usually randomly , but by magnitude in some cases ( red k giants , low - metallicity categories ) .",
    "after guide stars , blank sky patches and spectrophotometric and reddening standards are assigned hole positions on each plate , science target assignment begins in a round - robin fashion : the lists of possible objects in each of the 15 categories are examined in turn and the first object in each list is assigned a fiber ( assuming no @xmath75 collision with prior targets ) . after selecting a target from the fifteenth category , the algorithm returns to the first category and the process repeats until all fibers are assigned .",
    "categories are eliminated from consideration for target assignment when they reach their maximum fiber allocation or when there are no more candidates on a given list .",
    "this allows the categories with only a few targets per plate pair ( cool wd , sdm , brown dwarf ) to always have their candidates targeted , while several large categories ( bhb , f , low - metal candidates , g , k giant ) take up the bulk of the fibers on each plate pair .",
    "the overall picture of where target categories are located in color and proper motion space is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the @xmath91 optical color can be used as proxy for effective temperature , and it provides a reasonable estimate of spectral type . for a star with proper motion @xmath96 in @xmath97 , we define a reduced proper motion in the @xmath98 filter : @xmath99    targets are selected as primary detections ( duplicates and objects from overlapping scans removed ) of objects in the dr7 database with stellar ( not extended ) psfs ( the  star \" table in the database ) .",
    "candidates are required to pass the following sdss flag cuts on the quality of their photometric imaging data : objects must not be saturated ( flag bit : saturated ) , not close to the edge , not have an interpolated psf , ( interp_psf ) , and not have an inconsistent flux count ( badcounts ) .",
    "in addition , if the center is interpolated ( interp_center ) , there should not be a cosmic ray ( cr ) hit indicated .",

    ". plates with these pointings are marked with the stream name and ` strm ' in table 3 .",
    "the regular target selection algorithms described above were used on these streams , i.e. no special targets within the stream were given specific fibers .",
    "some bhb , bs , f turnoff , k giant , and g subgiant spectra are clearly confirmed stream members on these ` strm ' plates .",
    "identification of a particular star as a stream member versus a field star is of course , often difficult , and left to the interested researcher .",
    "all of the spectra and associated imaging from segue were made public as a part of dr7 of the sdss - ii survey on 2008 october 31 .",
    "the calibrated magnitudes and positions of objects as determined by the sdss photo pipeline software are available in the ` photoobjall ' and ` star ' tables of the cas database , which is available through interfaces at http://cas.sdss.org and described in detail at http://www.sdss.org .",
    "we note the segue and sdss legacy imaging and spectra are all in a single large database , so it is possible to obtain sdss legacy photometry and segue spectroscopic information for stars in the sdss and sdss - ii footprints as part of a single query , or closely related set of queries . the sspp and spectro outputs ( rv , @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , are available in tabular form in the ` sppparams ' and ` specobjall ' tables of the cas database",
    ". fits format files containing all of the @xmath149240,000 extracted , co - added , sky - subtracted , flux - calibrated spectra are available at http://das.sdss.org for interested researchers .",
    "similar files for all 200,000 stellar objects detected by sdss and sdss - ii legacy surveys are also available at the same location .    to highlight the usefulness of the data archive , we present an example sql query from the cas database to help construct plots showing the extent and scientific usefulness of segue data .",
    "we design a query to select segue - targeted g stars from the database , and return each object s photometric and tabulated spectroscopic information .",
    "the following sql query is presented to the cas dr7 database ( http://cas.sdss.org/casjobs ) :    .... select          dbo.frun(targetid ) as run ,         dbo.frerun(targetid ) as rerun ,         dbo.fcamcol(targetid ) as camcol ,         dbo.ffield(targetid ) as field ,         dbo.fobj(targetid ) as obj ,         g0,umg0,gmr0,spp.ra , spp.dec , spp.l , spp.b ,         spp.plate,spp.mjd,spp.fiberid,elodierv,elodierverr ,         feha , fehaerr , fehan , logga , loggaerr ,      elodierv+10.1*cos(b*3.14159/180)*cos(l*3.14159/180)+          224.0*cos(b*3.14159/180)*sin(l*3.14159/180)+              6.7*sin(b*3.14159/180 ) as vgsr      from sppparams spp , specobjall sp , platex p       where spp.specobjid = sp.specobjid and sp.plateid = p.plateid and       p.programname like ' segue% ' and       gmr0 between 0.48 and 0.55 and elodierverr > 0 ....    this query is written in ` sql ' , a standard database query language . some details of the query are as follows .",
    "the first six lines select photometric quantities for the desired objects , include the unique five - part sdss imaging i d ( run , rerun , camcol , field , obj ) , dereddened photometry ( @xmath150 ) , ( r.a.,decl . )",
    "j2000 , and galactic @xmath151 .",
    "the next lines select spectroscopic outputs for each object : unique three - part sdss / segue spectroscopic i d ( plate , mjd , fiberid ) , rv and error ( obtained by cross - correlation with elodie rv templates ) , elodierv , elodierverr in @xmath48 , and sspp estimates of [ m / h ] ( feha ) with error ( fehaerr ) and an indication of how many estimators went in to the [ m / h ] estimate ( fehan ) .",
    "similarly , the stellar surface gravity and error is retrieved ( logga , loggaerr ) .",
    "a significant fraction of the spectra will have feha or logga set to -9.999 , which indicates that the sspp did not have sufficient s / n to estimate this value confidently .",
    "these values are mostly for fainter @xmath152 spectra .",
    "the next lines take each object s heliocentric rv and galactic @xmath151 and uses the database to compute the galactocentric @xmath153 velocity using standard values for the solar motion .",
    "the selection is done with an sql ` join ' between the sspp table ` sppparams ' , and the spectroscopic i d table ` specobjall ' and the plate list table ` platex ' , requiring that the type of spectroscopic program matches the key phrase ` segue ' ( to exclude legacy sdss galaxy plates ) and that the dereddened color of the objects fall in the g dwarf color range ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "additionally the rv error must be greater than zero , indicating a minimal level of quality of the spectrum .",
    "this also excludes galaxies and quasars , leaving only objects with stellar kinematics .",
    "this query yields a table ( in comma separated value format , which may be downloaded to a user s local computer for further manipulation ) of 61,343 objects .",
    "individual images of spectra in this data set may be examined by fetching from the das , with a link like .",
    "wget http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/1880/gif/spplot-53262-1880-014.gif    where the object may be verified to be a g star .",

    "the topmost panel plots galactic @xmath155 versus @xmath25 for all g stars selected with the cas database query above . a sinusoidal curve with amplitude 120 @xmath67 shows the average path of stars rotating with the sun about the galactic center .",
    "several knots of g stars stick out from the general disk population(s ) .",
    "we focus on one set of stars with @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "galactic ( @xmath158 ) for this subset is plotted in the second panel .",
    "a histogram of the apparent magnitudes of the further subset of stars with @xmath159 is plotted in the third panel .",
    "if these stars are dwarfs at @xmath160 , their implied distance from the sun is 5 kpc .",
    "however , they may be giants or subgiants at much further distances .",
    "we plot the histogram of sspp surface gravities in panel 4 .",
    "there is a clear peak at subgiant and giant @xmath161 ( all g dwarfs have @xmath162 ) .",
    "therefore this population consists of subgiants with @xmath163 , placing the stars at @xmath164 kpc from the sun .",
    "a histogram of the quantity feha ( adopted average [ fe / h ] from the sspp pipeline ) for the subgiants is shown in the lowest panel .",
    "the estimated metallicity of these objects is @xmath70 = -1.4\\pm 0.5 $ ] .",
    "the location of these objects on the sky and their implied distances and velocities are consistent with that of sagittarius southern tidal stream stars , such as rr lyraes and bhbs seen in @xcite .",
    "this example just scratches the surface of the interesting science that can be obtained with the segue g star sample .",
    "the segue survey provides a large sample of more than 240,000 spectra of stars at ( @xmath44 ) covering 212 sightlines out to distances of 100 kpc .",
    "it supplements the sdss legacy imaging survey with an additional 3500 @xmath16 of @xmath9 imaging at @xmath19 .",
    "each 7 @xmath16 sightline obtains 1150 well - calibrated resolution @xmath165 spectra , analyzed by a uniform set of software pipelines to generate tables of rvs for all stars and estimates of [ fe / h ] , @xmath84 and @xmath85 for stars with s / n @xmath7 . the selected targets in each pointing cover all major spectroscopic types from wds to l brown dwarfs in numbers sufficient to sample the kinematic structure of all major stellar components of the galaxy ( except the bulge ) at distances from the solar neighborhood ( probed with m , l , and t dwarfs ) to 100 kpc from the sun ( probed with bhb and k / m giant stars ) .",
    "the segue sample is useful for isolating stellar substructures , particularly in the stellar halo .",
    "the unbiased sample of over 60,000 g dwarf spectra presents a unique way to study the galaxy s structure in detail .",
    "selected populations of rare targets ranging from cool wds to high proper motion subdwarf m stars to stars with metallicity @xmath70 < -3 $ ] allow theories of formation and evolution of the milky way to be newly constrained .",
    "a follow - up to the segue survey , entitled segue-2 , is now underway with the same instrument and telescope configuration and aims to obtain targeted spectra of a sample of similar size and quality to segue .",
