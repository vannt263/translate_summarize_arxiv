    "the investigation of single - particle tunneling in double - well ( dw ) potentials can be found in several relevant scenarios @xcite . for dw potentials , the maximum point ( @xmath0 ) between the two minima plays the role of a barrier that drives the quantum tunneling exhibited by the quantum superposition of ground and first excited states , when their energy are smaller than that from the hump .",
    "the quantum tunneling for a function generated by a two - wave superposition supported by novel symmetric and asymmetric dw potential configurations , when described in the phase - space , is investigated in this letter .",
    "in particular the dynamics of tachyonic modes supported by modified topological scenarios @xcite , different from those which holds stable tunneling , is discussed .",

    "proceeding is organized as following : in sec .",
    "@xmath3 , the framework for the calculation of the ground and first excited states for dw potential configurations is presented , and results for a kink - like deforming function @xcite are obtained ; in sec . @xmath4 the quantum tunneling and wigner flow for quantum superposition involving zero - mode stable and tachyonic states are calculated and discussed for symmetric and asymmetric dw configurations ; the conclusions are drawn in sec . @xmath5 .",
    "given the ground state , @xmath6 , of a @xmath7 potential , well - stablished quantum mechanical results , as those from @xcite , allow one to calculate the corresponding first excited , @xmath8 , state through a multiplier function that relates @xmath6 with @xmath8 as @xcite @xmath9 through the substitution of @xmath10 by @xmath11 into the schrdinger equation @xmath12\\psi_n(s)=0 $ ] for @xmath13 and subtracting the result from the schrdinger equation for @xmath14 multiplied by @xmath15 , one can find the quantity @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy difference between the states and henceforth shall be conveniently denoted by @xmath19 . considering that @xmath15 is an _",

    "this multiplier function is an input for both set of potentials : symmetric ( @xmath25 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath26 ) ones .",

    "once @xmath27 and @xmath10 have been established , two inequivalent topological scenarios that supports the quantum conversion of a zero - mode stable vacuum into an unstable tachyonic quantum state can be found . as to see the connection between their energies , one assumes a scalar field equation of motion , @xmath28 derived from a time independent lagrangian in @xmath29 , from which , through quantum perturbations , by an increment of @xmath30 , it is possible to find the schrdinger - like equation , @xmath31 with @xmath32 , i. e. the quantum mechanical potential analogue .",

[ vec31 ] for different times along the tunneling evolution .",
    "the first feature that is highlighted through the vector field is the difference between the classical ( red ) and quantum ( blue ) vector directions .",
    "the larger this difference , the greater the degree of non - classicality of the system @xcite .",
    "while passing through a minimum of the potential , the flow spins towards this point and one has the winding number @xmath78 .",
    "passing through a maximum of the potential , the flow also spins generating @xmath78 , but it spreads instead of concentrating .",
    "if it is a saddle point it elongates the flow making it slower and slower near the central point , through which one has @xmath79 .",
    "another feature is the flux reversion that corresponds to the regions where the wigner function attains negative values . in order to investigate this feature ally with the stagnation points position",
    ", one can imagine a top - down vertical line around @xmath82 in the first frame of fig .",
    "[ vec31 ] . following this line",
    "it is possible to first recognize one counterclockwise ( ccw ) vortex ( green circle ) , then a flow reversal followed by a saddle point ( yellow square ) , around @xmath83 . moving to negative values of @xmath80 one",
    "has a ccw vortex , causing again the flow inversion .",
    "this behavior is a further indication of the non - classical character of the system .    in order to see",
    "the stagnation points dynamics and calculate @xmath84 , the integration loop is depicted in each frame of fig .",
    "[ vec31 ] .",
    "note that the initial total winding number ( first frame ) is @xmath85 , correspondent to one clockwise ( cw ) vortex ( red circle ; @xmath78 ) , two ccw vortices ( green circles ; @xmath78 ) and one saddle point ( yellow square ) ; @xmath79 ) . in the next frame",
    "the saddle point starts to crumble while another cw vortex appears in the left .",
    "besides , one can no longer recognize the ccw vortices , which results again in a total winding number @xmath85 .",
    "considering all subsequent frames",
    "one sees that the saddle point completely disappears engendering sequentially @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , charge conservation is attained as conjectured @xcite .",
    "the novelty is that an opposite conclusion appears when considering the unstable case for which one has no charge conservation . for the unstable function",
    "however this lack of conservation is not totally a surprise , once it is predicted only for systems with unitary quantum dynamics .",
    "finally , the stagnation points also work as a tool for the recognition of tunneling .",
    "the function @xmath86 , which is found initially only in the right minimum of the potential , appears in the form of a cw vortex near @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ vec31 ] . after time evolution @xmath86",
    "coexists in both minima , thus causing the appearance of another cw vortex in the left - side in some subsequent frames .",
    "this behavior reveals the tunneling through the stagnation points .",
    "quantum tunneling analysis has shown that one has a reversibility of the process for the stable wave function whereas the tachyonic function attains a limit coexisting in both wells for any subsequent time .",
    "thereat one can say that the tunneling undergoes a process of coherent destruction .",
    "it was also noticed that the wigner vector field can be used to study non - classical features since it evinces the differences between quantum and classical vector flux profiles as well as the flow reversibility .",
    "the latter occurs where one has negative values for the wigner function related to the stagnation points .",
    "lastly , while one finds the expected charge conservation for stable wave functions , one draws attention to the fact that this conservation is not in principle expected for unstable functions .",
    "in fact , it is depicted from the vector flow analysis for the tachyonic case .",
