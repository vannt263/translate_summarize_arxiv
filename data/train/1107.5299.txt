    "the computations were performed with the adf quantum chemistry code @xcite which uses the kohn - sham approach to density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the kohn - sham approach replaces the many - body system within the hamiltonian equation by a system of the non - interacting particles while all the many body terms are incorporated into the so - called kohn - sham potential .",
    "this concept is quite useful in the investigation of interacting closed shell systems because it allows us to present each graphene flake as an isolated fragment and two fragments interacts as the flakes are stacked . in this way",
    ", a proper investigation of the forces and the orbital overlap can be performed directly in terms of the fragment presentation .    within the adf code the forces between fragments",
    "are included in the bonding energy @xmath7 which comprises of several majors components @xcite ( @xmath7= @xmath8+@xmath9+@xmath10+@xmath0+@xmath11 ) .",
    "the first component ( @xmath8 ) takes care of the interactions of electrostatic nature related to the modification of the charge distribution ( originated from the charge transfer between occupied and unoccupied orbitals ) , when two systems are allowed to interact .",
    "the second one is the energy change induced by the pauli repulsion ( @xmath9 ) , which include several components ; exchange repulsion , kinetic repulsion , overlap repulsion , all results from obeying the pauli antisymmetry principle .",
    "the next term @xmath10 describes the energy required to change the conformation of the fragments ( structural modification ) from the initial geometry containing separate fragments to the final geometry where the fragments are allowed to interact .",
    "the bonding interactions between two fragments are included in the @xmath12 term which originates from the overlap of the fragment s orbitals .",
    "the last term @xmath11 is the empirical dispersion correction introduced by grimme @xcite and its magnitude is defined by the long - range van der waals interactions , whose contribution in the short range is reduced by the damping function .    even though the @xmath0 term is a measure of the orbital overlap , the interlayer forces such as the pauli repulsion and orbital polarization contribute to the @xmath0 as well . the effect of interlayer forces can not be discarded from @xmath0 and so the overlap of the selected orbitals can not be separated from the others .",
    "this makes it hard to get a proper understanding of the intricacies of interlayer interactions between two fragments .",
    "the most effective way to proceed is to follow the established method of linear combinations of the orbitals .",
    "this method can be applied for the results obtained with the adf program . with the adf",
    ", each fragment is described by its own set of orbitals and the program facilitates their mixing upon the inclusion of the interaction between the fragments .",
    "therefore , the fragment approach allows us to evaluate the overlap matrix @xmath13 between the fragments @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the kohn - sham hamiltonian ( @xmath16 ) directly in terms of the linear combinations of the fragment orbitals via the relation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the eigenvector defined in terms of the fragment orbitals and @xmath19 is the eigenvalue matrix @xcite .",
    "the overlap matrix @xmath20 purely depends on the form of the interacting orbitals and on the distance that keeps the two fragments apart neglecting the contribution from the attractive and repulsive forces arising between the fragments .",
    "we used the overlap matrix @xmath13 to define the spatial overlap integral between the fragments @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which is @xmath21 .    in this work",
    "we consider the spatial overlap integral @xmath22 between the highest occupied fragment orbitals ( hofo ) , i.e. , between two @xmath4 orbitals , each located on different fragments while their overlap defines the homo of the joint system .",
    "the overlap integral was also calculated between the @xmath4 and @xmath23 orbitals , i.e. , between the highest occupied orbital of one fragment ( hofo@xmath24 ) with the lowest unoccupied orbital of another fragment ( lufo@xmath25 ) and because there are two parts of such interactions , hofo@xmath24-lufo@xmath25 and hofo@xmath25-lufo@xmath24 , the average value of overlap integral was considered and combined into the @xmath26 .",
    "we used the hybrid blyp exchange - correlation functional , applying the empirical dispersion correction 1.05 recommended by grimme @xcite . for the interacting molecules of closed electron shells",
    "it was found that the proposed correction is enough to reproduce the intermolecular distance to what is observed in the experiments or achieved with a more accurate level such as the _ ab initio _ mller - plesset second - order ( mp2 ) method @xcite . for a proper description of the tails of the electron wavefunctions that is important for long - range interactions",
    ", we used the slater - type orbitals .",
    "the quite extended tzp basis set ( triple-@xmath27 polarized basis set ) was applied in all the calculations which improves the precision of our results while suppressing the basis set superposition error @xcite .",
    "we tested the chosen method to reproduce the interlayer distance between the graphene flakes stacked in the ab pattern ( which is well known to be 3.4   in natural graphite ) and indeed the correct interlayer distance was obtained ( the so - called equilibrium distance of the ab pattern @xmath28 ) . for this calculation",
    "the atomic coordinates within the graphene plane ( along the @xmath29 directions ) were confined and only the coordinates in the @xmath30 direction , i.e. , perpendicular to the graphene plane , were used for relaxation .",
    "in fact , the full relaxation of the system of two stacked fragments is problematic as the repulsion between layers leads to sliding of the fragments away from each other .",
    "our main emphases in this work are the energy decomposition analysis of the bonding energy @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath0 ) and the spatial overlap integrals ( @xmath31 ) which are determined by the stacking pattern between two graphene flakes ( flake rotation ) and the interlayer distance . in most cases",
    "the single point calculations have been used for which the contribution of @xmath10 becomes zero .",
    "for our investigations we used two graphene flakes with the carbon atoms at the edges terminated by the hydrogen atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) with our goal to minimize the contribution of the localized states into the simulation results .",
    "because bilayer graphene obtained in the experiments @xcite has shown the aa stacking pattern instead of the ab , common in natural graphite , we probe the aa stacking for the equilibrium distance between the flakes ( @xmath32 ) . it was found that this distance is indeed enhanced in the aa stacking up to @xmath32=3.67   against the @xmath28=3.4   for the ab stacking . to explain an increase in the interlayer distance we applied the decomposition analysis of the bonding energy .",

    "@xmath8 is the electrostatic interactions , @xmath9 is pauli repulsion , @xmath0 is the orbital interactions energy . ]",
    "we performed the single point calculations in which the layers were separated by the established equilibrium distances ( @xmath33 ) found to be different for aa and ab stacking .",
    "the obtained interlayer forces and spatial overlap integrals are collected in table  [ tab : table1 ] . for the purpose of comparison , in addition to the lattice arrangements aa and",
    "ab , we also carried out the bonding analysis for the aa@xmath34 stacking pattern for which the interlayer equilibrium distance was found to be 3.41   and those results are also enclosed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the ab - conformation is characterized by a much stronger bonding interaction than that of aa , as defined by a more negative bonding energy @xmath7 , thereby making the ab - stacking the ground state of the system .",
    "the structural distinction of the ab configuration from aa consists in sliding of one graphene flake relative to the other by 1.42   along the @xmath35 axis that induces the shift of the bond positions between the layers against their superposition for the aa stacking ( for the aa case the atomic coordinates are matched in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions for both layers ) . to obtain the aa@xmath34 stacking a sliding of 1.23 ",
    "is applied along the @xmath36 axis .    for the aa",
    "stacking , due to the lattice superposition the @xmath4 clouds between the layers are also superposed that leads to their effective overlap defined by the spatial overlap integral @xmath22=0.443 ev . the flake sliding induced for the ab and aa@xmath34 stacking breaks the bond superposition condition recognized for the aa stacking thereby inducing the disarrangement of the @xmath4 clouds within the overlapping region . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath37 interlayer interactions , which is of particular interest since it is supposedly responsible for the occurrence of electronic coupling between the graphene layers @xcite , is significantly reduced for the ab stacking pattern .",
    "this is reflected by a suppression of the spatial overlap integral to @xmath22=@xmath380.229 ev ( even more drastic reduction is observed for the aa@xmath34 case where @xmath22=0.023 ev ) .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] the electronic properties and the interlayer forces between two graphene fragments stacked in aa ( @xmath32=3.67  ) , in ab ( @xmath28=3.4  ) and in aa@xmath34(@xmath32=3.41  ) configurations .",
    "all values are in ev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when two lattices of different flakes are superposed in the space , the electronic clouds of their @xmath4 orbitals are also superposed giving the maximum magnitude of the overlap integral @xmath22 which is being suppressed with the flake rotation because of misorientation of those @xmath4 clouds .",
    "therefore , the spatial overlap integral @xmath22 reaches its minimum as the rotation angle reaches the value of @xmath39 18@xmath5 which is being a result of significant disarrangement of the @xmath4 orbitals within the overlapping region from their superposed position .",
    "another overlap integral accounting for inter - band interactions , @xmath26 ( between homo and lumo orbitals belonging to the different fragments ) , has shown the opposite behavior to that of @xmath22 , i.e. , with its minimum for the superposed case while growing with the flake rotation . however , even when @xmath26 reaches the maximum at @xmath40 - 30@xmath5 , its magnitude is still much lower than that found for the ab - stacking .",
    "for the angle in the range of @xmath40 - 30@xmath5 , both integrals ( @xmath22 and @xmath26 ) deviate insignificantly . with breaking of the orthogonality of the @xmath4 orbitals",
    "as the flake is rotated , the pauli repulsion is also being suppressed by @xmath6 0.5 ev when its reaches its minimum at @xmath39 18@xmath5 .",
    "the reduced value of 3.831 ev for @xmath39 18@xmath5 becomes much closer to that for the ab stacking ( @xmath9=3.388 ev ) .",
    "moreover , the orbital interaction energy @xmath0 grows with flake rotation as the inter - band interactions reflected by the @xmath26 improve ( @xmath26 increases up to several orders of magnitude ) along with the fast reduction of the interlayer repulsion .",
    "the coincidence of the minimum of @xmath0 with the minimum value of the pauli repulsion achieved for the @xmath39 18@xmath5 is a clear evidence that the efficiency of the orbital interactions is being under direct control of the repulsive forces .",
    "therefore , because the layer rotation significantly suppresses the interlayer repulsion which in turn improves the orbital interaction , regardless of the deviation of the overlap integrals , the total bonding energy @xmath7 is lowered with rotation and its magnitude reaches its minimum also at @xmath39 18@xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the total bonding energy found for the angle @xmath39 18@xmath5 ( @xmath7=@xmath381.837 ev ) is comparable to that for the ab stacking ( @xmath7=@xmath381.931 ev in table  [ tab : table1 ] ) . above the rotation angle 30@xmath5",
    ", some fluctuations for all the terms occur while closer to angle 60@xmath5 for which the conditions for the lattice superposition between two layers reappear , i.e. , all the terms have the same values as for the angle 0@xmath5 .",
    "basically , the dependence in the range of the rotation angle from 30@xmath5 to 60@xmath5 is displayed in reverse order to that from 0@xmath5 to 30@xmath5 .",
    "our main conclusion is that the repulsion appeared as result of the interaction of two systems of closed electron shells whose lattices are superposed , is the central force controlling the efficiency of the interlayer orbital interactions .",
    "as the flake rotation breaks the lattice superposition , the suppression of the repulsion induces an improvement of orbital interactions ( such as the electronic coupling ) thereby lowering the bonding energy @xmath7 .",
    "because the orbital interaction between the flakes depends on the flake rotation , the equilibrium distance @xmath33 also fluctuates with rotation .",
    "the modification of the equilibrium distance @xmath33 follows the dependence observed for the bonding energy @xmath7 which is controlled by the pauli repulsion .",
    "the maximum equilibrium distance @xmath33=3.67   is obtained for the aa stacking which is suppressed down to @xmath33=3.43   as the flakes are at an angle 18@xmath5 that brings the system to the lowest energy state achievable with rotation . if the rotational angle grows further beyond 18@xmath5 , the magnitude of @xmath33 enhances again and for @xmath39 30@xmath5 its value is 3.54  .",
    "two graphene layers stacked in the aa pattern which is characterized by the lattice superposition between the layers is the most unstable configuration in the bilayer geometry .",
    "the instability appears as a result of strong interlayer repulsion induced by the interaction of the filled orthogonal @xmath4 orbitals within the overlap region .",
    "therefore , a disruption of the lattice superposition lowers the total bonding energy and therefore , leads to an enhancement of the system stability .",
    "the ab stacking is the most successful scheme to suppress the pauli repulsion because it induces the maximum mis - orientation in the interlayer lattice order and therefore , the ab stacking appear to be the ground state of the system characterized by the strongest bonding interactions between the layers .",
    "however , an alternative way to induce the lattice mis - orientation from that superposed in the aa stacking and thereby , to transfer the system to the lower energy state is the layer rotation .",
    "it should be noted that any modification of the lattice order different from the ab - stacking would be metastable ( such as aa@xmath34 ) because ab stacking is the ground state of the system .    for adjacent graphene flakes of finite size , the rotation of one flake relative to the other induces a fast reduction of the repulsive part ( @xmath9 ) and an increase of the attractive forces ( orbital interaction energy @xmath0 ) such that both these tendencies lower the total bonding energy between the layers @xmath7 . the lowest bonding energy @xmath7 is achieved for the rotation angle of @xmath41 18@xmath5 .",
    "this state is still metastable but with the lowest value of the bonding energy among all the rotation angles , and its value correlates with that for the ab - stacking being the ground state of bilayer graphene .",
    "however , as it was already noted above , the description of the adjacent graphene layers by the model system of finite flakes has crucial disadvantage caused by the underestimation of the inter - spot areas of the ab - stacking into the interlayer repulsion .",
    "as we switch to the twisted bilayer graphene of the infinite size , the contribution of large areas of ab stacking , which was largely neglected in the flake system , should be considered . for a small rotation angle",
    "the percentage of the aa spotted areas is large which decreases with angle enhancement .",
    "thus , for an angle altered from 10@xmath5 to 12@xmath5 , a decrease of 2.5 % of aa staking is observed @xcite . obviously , since the larger inter - spot areas of ab - stacking is observed for small rotation angles 2@xmath5 - 5@xmath5 ( see ref.@xcite for the images of various rotation structures ) , we would expect that the rotation angle of much smaller magnitude than that for the finite systems might be required ( @xmath42 18@xmath5 ) to bring the stacked graphene layers to the metastable state with the lowest energy .",
    "however , additionally to rotation there is another way to make the system of the flakes stacked in the aa arrangement more stable which is to raise the interlayer distance when the bonding energy is lowered again due to suppression of the pauli repulsion between the layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) ) . in case of misoriented bilayer graphene exhibiting the moir pattern",
    "the distribution of the repulsive forces would be non - uniform as the lattice order is not the same in different areas , i.e. a maximum force pushing apart two lattices would originate at the aa - spots of the lattice superposition .",
    "moreover , another interesting distinction between the system of adjacent flakes and bilayer graphene of infinite size is alteration of its rigidity . recalling that the free standing graphene is subjected to rippling of its surface @xcite , the lower rigidity of the graphene layers than that of flakes",
    "is anticipated .",
    "therefore , we expect that a strong pauli repulsion which is pronounced locally at the center of the aa - spots might not able to modify the interlayer separation throughout the whole system because of large areas of ab - stacking , but would rather induce a local lattice distortion forming the bump on the surface with its highest point at the center of the aa - spot @xcite . to simulate this effect , the flake of larger size containing the bigger areas of ab stacking have been examined and already for that system the generation of the bump as high as 0.2   was observed .",
    "however , the bump s height may be enhanced for an infinite system due to better efficiency of the attractive interactions in the inter - spot areas and lower rigidity of the layers .",
    "in fact , the appearance of bumps can explain the brightening of the aa - spots observed in the stm images of the twisted bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "the final point we wish to make is about the interlayer coupling which is found to be a function of the rotation angle and interlayer distance . as fragments being stacked , there are two types of @xmath4 interactions occurs , such as perturbation of the occupied / occupied orbitals ( @xmath4-@xmath4 interaction ) and interaction of the occupied / unoccupied orbitals ( @xmath4-@xmath23 interaction ) . according to the theoretical models developed to describe the behavior of the @xmath4 bands in bilayer graphene ,",
    "the modification of the linear dispersion of the dirac cones to a parabolic one has been simulated by inclusion only of the @xmath4-@xmath4 orbital interaction @xcite .",
    "however , we found that although the intra - bands interactions plays an important role , but particularly the inter - bands part must be introduced in the model to account for the decoupling effect arising in the aa stacked graphene layers .",
    "the orbital interaction energy @xmath0 is therefore suppressed at least by five times as the lattice arrangement was changed from ab to aa due to vanishing of the @xmath4-@xmath23 interactions between fragments that is reflected by a drastic reduction of the spatial overlap integral @xmath26 .",

    "<S> contrary to the conventional wisdom that only the long - range van der waals interaction is important in the case of stacking of closed shell systems , for the ab stacking in graphite it was shown that the orbital overlap between the @xmath4 orbitals belonging to different layers @xcite is as essential as the all important van der waals forces . therefore , it was predicted that despite the well known interlayer distance of 3.4   in natural graphite , for a system containing only two or three layers , the interlayer spacing depends on the number of layers @xcite due to different nodal interactions of the overlapping @xmath4 orbitals . for an odd number of adjacent layers </S>",

    "<S> appearance of the rotational misorientation that is independent of the fabrication techniques suggests the presence of some forces between the layers strong enough to cause the layer rotation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the available theoretical models @xcite on the electronic properties of the aa stacked graphene deal only with the band properties but do not shed any light on the underlying physical reasons involved in decoupling , such as the interlayer forces .    in a recent work @xcite we related the origin of the decoupling phenomenon and rotational misorientation with layer stacking pattern which is aa in fabricated multilayer graphene @xcite against the ab stacking in natural graphite . </S>",
    "<S> for the aa staking , the interlayer electronic coupling is suppressed by a significant repulsion arising between the graphene layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this repulsion is also expected to be responsible for the occurrence of lattice misorientation between the layers . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested that rotational misorientation , which creates the moir pattern , appears as a way to suppress the repulsion , thereby lowering the total energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> even a slight layer rotation of @xmath62@xmath5 - 5@xmath5 substantially shrinks the areas characterized by the aa lattice superposition in which repulsion dominates over other forces ( the areas with aa and ab stacking coexist in the moir pattern ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other important result was a prediction @xcite that the strong repulsion may induce bumps on the graphene surface in the areas where aa stacking is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects are important and require careful studies because the phenomenon of layer rotation through electronic coupling between layers can offer ways to manipulate the electronic properties of twisted graphene ( moir pattern of different rotation angle is characterized by different percentage of aa - spotted areas ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this work we present a detailed quantitative analysis of the repulsive forces and the orbital overlap in stacked graphene layers and their alteration with the appearance of rotation . </S>",
    "<S> our studies are based on the density functional methods including a recently proposed empirical correction ( grimme correction @xcite ) which was developed for a proper consideration of the dispersive interactions between the closed shell electron systems . </S>"
