    "+ summarize what we have so far , the quotient @xmath115 is an oriented graph of groups with the following properties : every vertex or edge stabilizer is isomorphic to @xmath74 , the edge stabilizer embeds into its tail vertex stabilizer by multiplying @xmath10 , and to its head vertex stabilizer by multiplying @xmath55 ; moreover , every oriented loop @xmath110 in @xmath115 has an even number of edges , where exactly half of them coincide with the orientation .",
    "this is a consequence of addendum [ add ] and the observation that @xmath110 lifts to an oriented path @xmath116 in @xmath45 with initial point and end point identified by the action of some element in @xmath68 .        choosing a base vertex @xmath120 in @xmath117 , since its stabilizer is @xmath74 , we construct a cylinder @xmath121 $ ] with radius @xmath12 . for every edge and every other vertex , we will construct a cylinder @xmath121 $ ] with radius determined inductively by the following criteria : + _ _ + we now explicitly define these radius so that the above criteria are satisfied .",
    "we start by defining the radius @xmath122 of the cylinder corresponding to a vertex @xmath123 of @xmath117 as follows .",
    "let @xmath110 be an oriented path connecting @xmath120 to @xmath123 .",

    "then the concatenation @xmath126 is an oriented loop in @xmath115 which ( as observed above ) must have the same number of @xmath127 edges as @xmath128 edges .",
    "now let @xmath129 and then the radius @xmath130 of an edge @xmath112 is defined by @xmath131 where @xmath123 is the head vertex of @xmath112 .",
