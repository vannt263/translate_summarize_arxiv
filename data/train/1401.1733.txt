    "since 2008 , the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) has detected more than 35 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs)@xcite and enabled us to establish the followings :    delayed onset of high - energy emission compared to the prompt kev - mev emission phase ,    extra spectral component seen at lat energy range during the prompt emission phase for some grbs ,    the existence of the long - lasting mev - gev emission for many lat grbs .",
    "it is commonly believed that the long - lasting mev - gev emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation.@xcite on the other hand , the inverse compton ( ic ) radiation of the forward shock electrons were expected to give rise to high - energy gamma - ray radiation as well.@xcite however , the signature of ic radiation is missing : the spectrum of the extended emission above 100 mev is usually characterized by a single power law of photon index @xmath12 over a broad time ranges.@xcite",
    "the duration , @xmath2 , of grb  130427a is about 138s .",
    "it has an energy fluence of 2@xmath310@xmath4  erg  @xmath5 , putting it as the grb with the highest fluence in gbm@xcite and konus - wind@xcite mission lives and the most luminous grb at z@xmath60.5 .",
    "it also has the highest fluence in the lat energy range during the prompt phase.@xcite twelve @xmath010  gev photons were detected in the first 700s after the burst onset , including a 95  gev photon that arrived at 243s after the burst onset , corresponding to an intrinsic photon energy 128  gev at z@xmath70.34 , breaking previous records of the highest energy photon from grbs  .",
    "the 100  mev to 100  gev emission from grb  130427a lasts well beyond the prompt emission period until about one day after the grb onset .",
    "this is the longest gev afterglow emission ever recorded for a grb .",
    "furthermore , the gev photons that grb 130427a emits contain some of the most energetic gamma - rays from grbs .",
    "even compared to the four brightest lat grbs ( grb  080916c , grb  090510 , grb  090902b , and grb  090926a ) known so far , grb  130427a is still peculiar in that it radiated over a hundred @xmath01 gev photons and a dozen photons at energies above 10  gev.@xcite",
    "the 100  mev to 100  gev light curve derived from likelihood analysis is shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "details of the likelihood analyzes can be found in ref .  .",
    "one can see that the peak time ( @xmath120  s ) , peak flux ( @xmath12@xmath310@xmath4  photons  @xmath5  s@xmath8 ) and the temporal decay index ( @xmath91.2 ) is not so much different from the other lat grbs ( see figure 14 in ref .  ) .",
    "since grb spectra are expected to change over time , _ we performed the first time - resolved spectral analysis of the lat data from grb  130427a_.@xcite to extract general mev ",
    "gev spectral properties of grb  130427a during the prompt and afterglow periods , only four time intervals were chosen .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the spectra are not well described by single power laws in some time intervals chosen here and there is a strong evidence for a spectral component below @xmath12  gev and another component above @xmath12  gev .",
    "we also tabulated the arrival times of @xmath010  gev photons.@xcite fitting the data from 138  s to 80  ks with a broken power law gave an improvement over a power law at the @xmath13 significance level .",
    "comparison of spectral fits using single power law and broken power law are shown in table  [ spec_comparism ] .",
    "_ it is the first time that an extra hard component above a few gev is seen from a grb well after the end of the prompt emission phase and up to one day after the burst . _",
    "while it is unlikely that this component is produced by the synchrotron emission , we suggest that inverse - compton processes provide a natural alternative explanation to the photons at tens of gev energies that arrived deep in the afterglow period.@xcite",
    "the burst occurred when it was day time at the magic and h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope sites , thus no observation was possible .",
    "it was night time for veritas but the full moon has prevented any observation that night .",
    "hawc observed it with scaler mode while the elevation of the burst was @xmath133@xmath10 .",
    "these observing conditions caused a reduced sensitivity of the instruments and higher energy threshold .",
    "no detection was found.@xcite      very high - energy gamma - ray observations of other grbs have been carried out before but no detection have been found even though some observations started just several tens of seconds after the grb onset.@xcite this can be due to several factors : ( a ) the relatively high redshift of many grbs , ( b ) delayed observations , and/or ( c ) the lack of a very - high energy gamma - ray component.@xcite    we have discovered an extra hard spectral component above a few gev from grb  130427a that exists from @xmath1100  s up to one day after the grb onset .",
    "this means that the afterglow spectrum of a grb may extend to the very high - energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray range , i.e. , @xmath0100  gev , thus we have shown that the factor ( c ) alone is not sufficient anymore for grbs like grb  130427a .",
    "more grb observations using current or future generations of the imaging atmosphere cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , such as h.e.s.s .",
    "ii,@xcite magic ii , veritas , and cta , not only minutes but hours after the prompt emission phase is thus crucial to study such a hard spectral component in more details , thanks to their much larger effective collection area .    as a final note",
    ", we would like to point out that by extrapolating the lat spectrum at late times , i.e. , 3  ks to 80  ks after the burst , to very high - energy gamma - ray range , the grb flux is still a few times stronger than the crab nebula flux at such energies and therefore can be easily detected with , e.g. , one minute of h.e.s.s .",
    "very recently , the fermi lat collaboration also reported on the temporally extended emission.@xcite using finer time bins between 138  s and 750  s after the burst , they found that the two spectral components reported here actually doimates at different times . at late times ( i.e.",
    ", 3  ks to 80  ks after the burst ) , emission above a few gev can be clearly seen in the spectral energy distribution during this period as well ( see their fig .",
