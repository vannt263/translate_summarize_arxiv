    "bismuth is a material which plays an important role in solid state physics . due to an extremely small fermi surface",
    "this material provides the remarkable possibility to observe strong effects induced by the presence of external fields , pressure and temperature , even if these external forces are of moderate amplitude .",
    "several important phenomena , shubnikov - de haas@xcite and de haas - van alphen@xcite effects , were observed for the first time in bismuth . in a last few years a series of experiments",
    "have once again drawn the attention of the community to elemental bismuth , and challenged our understanding of this material .",
    "high pressure optical spectroscopy measurements indicate that the mechanism of semimetal to semiconductor decay is not fully understood@xcite .",
    "reflectivity measurements@xcite showed large changes in the plasmon frequency and anomalous mid - infrared features , indicating strong scattering of the electronic degrees of freedom by a plasmon collective mode .",
    "an extremely strong nernst signal with unusual temperature dependence ( both at low@xcite and high fields@xcite ) was also reported .",
    "these recent experiments were showing clearly that the question of transport in bismuth was still not understood .",
    "in fact similar questions still existed for the standard resistivity as well .",
    "the majority of the resistivity experiments had been done in late 70s , beginning with the works of hartmann@xcite , kukkonen@xcite and later studies@xcite , who showed that down to 4k the fermi liquid theory ( with components of very different masses ) works quite well .",
    "the @xmath5 resistivity behavior at lowest temperatures was explained within this theory@xcite .",
    "however the discussion was not closed because one year later more detailed , lower temperature data by uher@xcite was published , and showed a significant deviation from expectations : the @xmath5 behavior changes smoothly into a @xmath3 behavior at the lowest temperatures . a quite complex theory involving coupling to particular group of phonons",
    "was proposed as an explanation of this result@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to re - examine the theory of transport in semimetals .",
    "we show that these anomalous transport properties have a simple explanation .",
    "they come from the fact that the coupling between electrons and holes with very different masses induces many body corrections to the fermi liquid picture .",
    "in fact the above mentioned change in the resistivity was the first example how interactions in semimetals modify the simple fermi liquid picture . although our study is mostly focused on bismuth , we also examine other materials which have been recently the subject of intensive studies , such as graphite@xcite and @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mecha ] we introduce the model of interaction between the electrons and holes .",
    "we show that at low temperatures , a collective acoustic plasmon mode exists and plays a central role in the properties of the material .",
    "we discuss also the high temperature regime of conductivity and show that the baber mechanism@xcite is the dominant source of resistivity in this regime .",
    "we then examine in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowt ] the low temperature regime for the resistivity .",
    "we develop an effective theory for this regime and derive a new @xmath7 dependence , which is a direct consequence of the existence of a collective acoustic plasmon mode .",
    "we examine the magneto - transport in sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetop ] .",
    "we show in particular that a double plasma edge must exist .",
    "some discussion on the validity of the approximations used to derive the above mentioned results are indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "some technical details can be found in the appendices .",
    "the peculiarity of bismuth comes from the very small characteristic energy scales of its fermi liquid ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : band - structure ] ) .     a sketch of the band structure of bismuth : three electron pockets and a central hole pocket .",
    "( top ) the energy dispersion .",
    "energies are in mev .",
    "( bottom ) the four pockets .",
    "the scale is grossly exaggerated .",
    "in fact @xmath8 are @xmath9 smaller than intra - pocket distances .",
    "the electron pockets are slightly tilted out of bisectrix - binary plane @xmath10 perpendicular to the trigonal axis @xmath11 .",
    "figure after ref . ]",
    "this stems from a slightly distorted cubic crystal structure ( the distortion angle is smaller than @xmath12 ) . in the absence of distortion bismuth",
    "would be a band insulator , instead it is a quite rare rhombohedral space group @xmath13 ( without inversion symmetry ) .",
    "bismuth becomes a semimetal with very small amounts of fermions active at accessible energies .",
    "the hamiltonian of those carriers close to fermi energy in bismuth reads in general : @xmath14 in the above @xmath15 denotes a hole pocket , while there are three electron pockets denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the first two terms are the free fermion kinetic energies .",
    "we approximate the kinetic energy of each type of carrier by a a free dispersion relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the species , the index @xmath19 are the three principal axes of the energy ellipsoid ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure ] ) , @xmath20 is the mass tensor , the @xmath21 are the momenta centered on the corresponding pocket and @xmath22 the fermi energy of the corresponding species .",
    "the values of the parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : masses ] .",
    ".[tab : masses ] the band parameters of bismuth according to ref .  .",
    "masses are in units of the mass of the electron , and wavevectors in units of reciprocal length @xmath23 .",
    "the values are given along the principal axes of the ellipsoids as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that two extreme approximations give rather similar values .",
    "the correct values for bismuth should therefore be between these two extremes .",
    "this suggests that @xmath24 is far from being negligible .",
    "taking such values for @xmath24 gives an energy of @xmath25 for the temperature below which the acoustic plasmon becomes strongly coherent .    in the perpendicular plane",
    "the situation is significantly more complex .",
    "in fact we have to work with a multi - plasma problem given the three electron pockets so we can only give qualitative arguments .",
    "let us stay within the ud approximation , remembering that it tends to slightly overestimate @xmath24 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : band - structure ] we immediately see that by changing the @xmath26 direction we are facing the following situation :    * there is one central hole pocket with an angle independent mass @xmath27 .",
    "* the mass of each electron pocket can vary drastically . from very light",
    "@xmath28 up to the heaviest of all @xmath29 * the electron pockets are situated with an relative orientation of @xmath30 and thus for every @xmath26 direction there are either very light and/or very heavy electrons present .",
    "this open the possibility for several plasmons to emerge , but most of them are strongly landau damped .",
    "a rough estimation gives ( for @xmath26 not far from the bisectrix between two pockets ) : for light hole - heavy electron @xmath31 ; for light electron - heavy hole @xmath32 ; for light electron - heavy electron @xmath33 . for another intermediate orientation ( @xmath34 angle with the bisectrix ) both electron masses will be smaller .",
    "a more precise evaluation of @xmath24 would be quite difficult and probably also susceptible to a significant error .",
    "let us only emphasize that for the fermi energies @xmath35 , thus a smaller value of @xmath24 in the perpendicular plane does not immediately imply a smaller @xmath36 in this plane .",
    "finally let us make two comments for plasmons far from the trigonal axis :    1 .",
    "if we had taken the erpa approximation we would have found rather low values of @xmath24 along the bisectrix axis which would imply a notable trigonal / bisectrix anisotropy of the observed @xmath36 .",
    "this is not the case found experimentally .",
    "due to particular positioning of fermi surface pockets it is practically always possible to find carriers with rather different masses . thus we expect that a drop of @xmath24 for some directions is rather the exception than the rule .",
    "these rare cases should not affect significantly the @xmath26 momentum integrals such as the one in ( [ eq : res_result ] ) .",
    "note that in the above estimation of the @xmath36 values we have neglected local field corrections .",
    "these always tend to reduce @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "precisely : the larger @xmath24 the larger influence of local field corrections .",
    "the `` deybe '' temperatures found by resistivity fits by uher@xcite are thus lower but this possible discrepancy was already discussed in the sec.[sec : new_rho ] .",
    "in order to compute the anisotropy of the resistivity due to the baber scattering we start from the formula obtained in ref .   ( eq .  2.14 in this paper ) and apply it to our problem with slow and rapid carriers : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy exchanged in the scattering process ( determined by the exchanged momenta @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the density of carriers in a given direction , @xmath42 the strength of carrier s interaction . in our model , instead of the @xmath42 of ( [ eq : tg_sh ] ) , included in @xmath43 , the averaged scattering rate @xmath44 must be substituted . following the derivation of ref .",
    "we take the carriers velocity along the resistivity axis as the variational parameter @xmath45 .",
    "according to textbook procedure ( p.283 in ref . )",
    "@xmath46 is then equal to the total change of @xmath47 during scattering event which in our case means @xmath48 .",
    "when one derives the relation @xmath49 , one needs to take the masses along @xmath50-axis .",
    "the momentum along a given direction must be conserved , which implies that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the momentum exchanged along resistivity axis .    the summation in ( [ eq : tg_sh ] ) is taken over vectors of incoming and outgoing carriers .",
    "the detailed , all - t treatment of ( [ eq : tg_sh ] ) would be quite complicated , but we are interested only in lowest temperatures , where the energy exchanged during scattering goes to zero @xmath53 ( we always stay on the fermi surface ) and the density of both electrons and holes is constant ( the chemical potential in semimetal is rather stable ) .",
    "we also know from band structure that there is no nesting @xmath54 and these fermi wavevectors are also constant .",
    "note that the derivation in ref .   was done for a two dimensional system .",
    "working in three dimensions requires one extra angle @xmath55 to complete the spherical coordinates .",
    "it is an angle between incoming momenta of light and heavy carriers between @xmath56 which was obviously equal to zero for 2d case .",
    "as long as we are interested in the resistivity along the high symmetry directions ( which is the one usually measured ) and in the limit of small @xmath57 we may assume that the functional relations @xmath58 and @xmath59 , originating from energy conservation , do not depend on the new angle @xmath55 .",
    "one integrates out this extra variable , but this does not change the low energy @xmath60-dependence ( because the condition @xmath53 allows to give a unique relation between @xmath61 ) .    with the above remarks we can evaluate the momentum sums , transposed into integral over the angles @xmath61 , @xmath55 .",
    "the masses @xmath62 and @xmath63 entering to formulas accounting for energy conservation ( during scattering event ) @xmath58 and @xmath59 are averaged over all angles on the fermi surface when integration over all possible orientations in taken .",
    "this brings us to an analog of eq .  3.4 in ref .",
    "with the anisotropy factor extracted : @xmath64 where an integral is angle averaged which also means averaged over all momenta on the fermi surface .",
    "the integral is rather complicated in 3d .",
    "we can safely assume that the anisotropy of the resistivity is caused only by the two factors in front : a change of carriers velocity @xmath65 ( along the resistivity direction ) during the scattering event which we already discussed above and the denominator @xmath66 .",
    "the denominator @xmath66 is constant when @xmath67 and it introduces the probability of such a scattering event , which is proportional to carrier density determined along the given direction by @xmath68 .",
    "the resistivity can be expressed as @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that , in the low temperatures ( when @xmath70 ) , the main contribution to the anisotropy of resistivity is accounted by the factor @xmath71 which after straightforward simplification gives : @xmath72 ^ 2\\cdot i\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is angle averaged integral . in the case of two pockets fermi surface",
    "this immediately leads to : @xmath74 ^ 2\\ ] ] @xmath75 and @xmath76 are second rank tensor with values ( along main axis ) given in tab .",
    "[ tab : masses ] .",
    "a reminder is necessary : the masses which are substituted into ( [ eq : ratio ] ) are not the ones given in tab .",
    "[ tab : masses ] .",
    "indeed the masses in ( [ eq : ratio ] ) are the ones along external directions while the tab .",
    "[ tab : masses ] gives the ellipsoid parameters .",
    "this point is particularly important for electrons along the trigonal axis : there is very small @xmath77 but ( due to out of bisectrix plane tilt @xmath55 of the electron ellipsoid ) @xmath78 contains an admixture of relatively large @xmath79 : @xmath80 there is one extra complication , not present only if the selected direction is the trigonal one .",
    "it comes from the fact that in bismuth we have more than two families of carriers . in the particular case of the bisectrix axis ( along which resistivity",
    "is frequently measured ) we have to deal with three different types of carriers ( holes , light and heavy electrons ) with certain probabilities for each type of scattering event .",
    "this leads to : @xmath81 which one can compare with @xmath82 measured along trigonal axis precisely what we did in sec .",
