    "data were obtained during the nights of 1012 december 2004 with the sparsepak ifu ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we used the 860 l / mm grating at order 2 , which provides a spectral resolution @xmath2 4,900 , and the 316 l / mm grating at order 8 , which provides a spectral resolution @xmath3 10,000 . in the latter mode ,",
    "the wavelength coverage includes the h@xmath4 , [ n@xmath5ii ] @xmath66548,6583 and [ s@xmath5ii ] @xmath66716,6731 emission lines .",
    "the higher spectral resolution data are presented and discussed in this paper .",
    "the data were reduced in iraf .",
    "figure [ figure : image ] shows the sparsepak pointings on an h@xmath4 image of ngc 891 .",
    "[ figure : image ]",
    "to analyze the kinematic structure of the dig halo of ngc 891 , position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams have been constructed from the spectra of all 82 fibers in pointing ` h ' ( cf .",
    "[ figure : image ] ) . to enhance",
    "signal - to - noise , several fibers were averaged together for each major axis distance @xmath7 at the highest @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ figure : image ] indicates which fibers were included in each @xmath0-range . because a bright sky line interferes with several of the h@xmath4 profiles , and to increase signal - to - noise , pv diagrams were constructed of the sum of the [ n@xmath5ii ] @xmath86583 + [ s@xmath5ii ] @xmath86716 emission lines .",
    "contour plots of the pv diagrams are included in figure [ figure : pvdiags ] .",
    "rotation curves were derived for each pv diagram using the envelope tracing method ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because ngc 891 is nearly edge - on ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) , the edge of each line profile furthest from the systemic velocity ( the `` envelope '' ) corresponds to gas at the line of nodes ; this velocity is thus approximately the azimuthal velocity at that @xmath7 .",
    "the azimuthal velocity is found by ( @xcite ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the velocity at the location of the envelope , @xmath12 is the velocity resolution of the instrument , and @xmath13 is the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "azimuthal velocity curves were constructed from the pv diagrams , and are shown in figure [ figure : rotcurs ] .",
    "extinction in the midplane prevented reliable velocities from being found for @xmath14 .",
    "[ figure : rotcurs ]    it is clear from figure [ figure : rotcurs ] that the derived azimuthal velocities decrease with height .",
    "a close inspection of the pv diagrams shows that this is not an effect of signal - to - noise variations with height .",
    "an average azimuthal velocity gradient of 0.80 km s@xmath1 arcsec@xmath1 ( 17 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 ) was calculated .",
    "similar results were obtained by following this procedure for the [ n@xmath5ii ] @xmath86583 emission line alone ( 14 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "these values are in agreement with that measured by @xcite for the neutral component , 15 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 .",
    "the envelope tracing method is sensitive to the changing signal - to - noise ratio of the data with @xmath0 . to account for this effect and the radial gas distribution ,",
    "we have generated galaxy models .",
    "the h@xmath4 image presented in figure [ figure : image ] was used to obtain estimates of the radial density profile at each of the heights considered in the model . because the distribution of the dig is not axisymmetric , the profiles were modified by hand to better match the shape of the data pv diagrams .",
    "the amplitude of the radial density profile was chosen such that the signal - to - noise in the model approximately matched that in the data .",
    "we then created model galaxies with these derived radial profiles using a version of the gipsy task galmod , modified to allow for a vertical gradient in azimuthal velocity which begins at a height @xmath15 above the midplane : @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 has units of [ km s@xmath1 arcsec@xmath1 ] , and for the models considered here , the major axis rotation curve is flat [ @xmath19 km s@xmath1 ] .",
    "the inclusion of the parameter @xmath15 was motivated by the results of @xcite , who find that the gradient in the neutral component of ngc 891 starts at approximately @xmath20 kpc ( though that result may be a consequence of beam smearing ) .",
    "that value of @xmath15 was used for the models shown here , but we note that the appropriate value can not be determined for our data ( we lack data below @xmath21 kpc ) .",
    "artificial sparsepak observations were made of the models to create pv diagrams , and compared to the data ( figure [ figure : pvdiags ] ) .",
    "the model that appears to best match the data has @xmath22 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 .",
    "a statistical analysis of difference images suggests that the best match occurs at @xmath23 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 , but because the model can not perfectly reproduce the shape of the pv diagrams , comparing by eye is the most reliable way to determine the gradient . to ensure that our results are not influenced by an incorrect specification of the radial density profile , we also consider models with a flat radial density profile , and find that the same gradient yields the best match .",
    "we conclude that the vertical gradient in azimuthal velocity for the dig halo of ngc 891 is approximately 15 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 .",
    "to attempt to understand the origin of the azimuthal velocity gradient derived in this paper , the kinematic data will be compared with the results of an entirely ballistic model of disk  halo flow ( cf .",
    "further information regarding the kinematic structure will be obtained once the lower spectral resolution pointings are reduced and analyzed .",
    "results from these efforts will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
