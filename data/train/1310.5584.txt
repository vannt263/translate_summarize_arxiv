    "the study of the population of star - forming galaxies has undergone a dramatic acceleration thanks to the advent of the scuba submillimetre continuum array receiver and of the _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ satellites which for the first time allowed the investigation of the evolution of the majority of such sources  those whose activity is enshrouded by dust  up to redshifts @xmath15 .",
    "star formation rates ( sfrs ) at high redshifts were found to reach spectacular levels ( @xmath16 @xmath17/yr , e.g. yan et al .",
    "2005 ; casey et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the interpretation of these objects is however still controversial . on the other hand , a definite assessment on their nature",
    "has become compelling , especially at a time when the astronomical community is witnessing the birth of two amazing programs aimed at mapping the distribution of star forming galaxies up to very large cosmological scales and early epochs : euclid and ska .",
    "three main scenarios for the early evolution of galaxies can be found in the literature : the so - called merger driven evolution model , the star formation fueled by cold flows model and the self - regulated by baryon processes model .",
    "the merger - driven evolution model addresses the large enhancement in the star formation activity observed at @xmath18 as due to gas - rich major merging events .",
    "two different scenarios have been proposed : the first one ( baugh et al . 2005 ) requires modest - sized merger - induced starbursts whose bolometric luminosity is greatly enhanced by a top - heavy initial mass function , while the second one ( e.g. narayanan et al .",
    "2009 ) relies on major mergers of large and gas - rich galaxies as the trigger for the starburst phase . amongst the many predictions from these two scenarios are small masses for the @xmath18 active galaxies in the first case ( almeida , baugh & lacey , 2011 ; kim et al .",
    "202 ) and large masses and a very short duration of the starburst phase ( @xmath19  gyr ) in the second case ( narayanan et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the star formation fueled by cold flows scenario introduced by fardal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( see also dekel , sari & ceverino 2009 ) instead explains the high redshift starburst phenomenon as the product of smooth and steady accretion of gas ( and minor mergers ) onto massive galaxies .",
    "thanks to the dense intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the short cooling times expected at these high redshifts ( see e.g. dekel & birnboim 2006 ) , galaxies will have large accretion rates and therefore will form stars at high rates on relatively long timescales .",
    "this model therefore predicts large masses for @xmath18 star forming galaxies , and relatively long timescales which then convert in a long duty cycle ( @xmath20 per cent , i.e. one of such galaxies out of two will be observed in the active star forming phase , dav et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the third model is the so - called galaxy formation by self - regulated baryon processes .",
    "this was first introduced by granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and subsequently implemented by lapi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and cai et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . in this model , which also predicts relatively large masses and long timescales for the high-@xmath21 starburst phenomenon , star formation is triggered by the fast collapse of the dark matter halo and is controlled by self - regulated baryonic processes , such as the rapid cooling of the available gas and energy feedbacks from supernovae ( sn ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "agn feedback is particularly relevant for the most massive galaxies and is responsible for the shorter duration ( @xmath22 gyr ) of their active star - forming phase . in less massive galaxies ,",
    "the star formation rate is mostly regulated by supernovae feedbacks and continues for a few gyrs .",
    "as already discussed , the above models predict very different behaviours and physical properties for the galaxy population responsible for the intense star forming activity witnessed at redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "this is particularly true for what concerns galaxy and halo masses and duration of the starburst phase .",
    "they also make different predictions on which objects these galaxies will end up into in the more local universe .",
    "this is why clustering measurements at different redshifts are a very important tool to discriminate amongst different scenarios , and can provide the ultimate answer on the nature of such sources .    as a first step in this direction we",
    "have then collected from the literature and subsequently analyzed clustering results derived for very active  @xmath24 $ ] @xmath1/yr  star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "galaxies observed in different wavebands ( from the uv to radio / hi ) were grouped into classes of sources selected at approximately the same rest - frame frequency , and with comparable luminosities , so to overcome any possible bias stemming from selection effects .",
    "furthermore , clustering results were homogenized to allow for a direct comparison between the various estimates .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows :  2 introduces the different samples considered in our analysis and provides some estimates for their bolometric luminosities and star formation rates , while  3 presents a compilation of clustering lengths @xmath25 as taken from the original works and homogenized to take into account variations in the cosmological parameters and in the slopes of the estimated two - point correlation function amongst the different samples .",
    " 4 provides our results for the redshift evolution of the halo masses of star - forming galaxies between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while  5 discusses their cosmological evolution .",
    " 6 summarizes our conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath28cdm cosmology with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in order to investigate the properties of star - forming systems at the different cosmological epochs , we have collected from the literature clustering results which refer to galaxies with highly enhanced star formation activity ( i.e. galaxies at the high end of the sfr distribution ) , selected in different wavebands : uv , sub - mm , mid - infrared ( ir ) , far - ir , optical / near - ir ( bzk ) and radio / hi .",
    "we further required the redshift distribution of each sample to be known with good accuracy ( spectroscopic and/or good quality photometric redshifts ) . those samples which include",
    "data at both low and high redshifts have been divided into selection classes as follows : + ( i ) far - ir selection ( group a ) +  low redshift : iras - qdot galaxies ( saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence 1992 ) .",
    "+  intermediate redshift : @xmath34 herschel galaxies respectively brighter than 8 and 5 mjy selected at 100@xmath35 m by the pep survey ( lutz et al .",

    "a point which is important to keep in mind in the following analysis is that , within the same selection class , galaxies at the different redshifts roughly probe the same rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the low-@xmath21 , * @xmath39 * selection mirrors the @xmath12 , i - band selection of the hdfn . in the same way , @xmath18 , @xmath41m - selected laboca galaxies can be considered the high - redshift counterparts of the local h - atlas sources observed at @xmath42 m , and the iras @xmath43m - selection at @xmath27 corresponds to that of herschel galaxies observed at @xmath44 m at @xmath9 and at @xmath45 m at @xmath18 ( cfr .",

    "note that the mid - ir selection only includes galaxies with @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the 24@xmath47 m selection at lower redshifts includes a non - negligible fraction of agn - powered galaxies ( e.g. gruppioni et al .",

    "we also note that , at variance with the other works , those of brodwin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and starikova et al .",
    "( 2012 ) base their results on models for the source redshift distribution obtained from extrapolation from other datasets .",
    "this might imply larger uncertainties in their results and most likely an underestimate of the true clustering signal due to its dilution by interlopers mistakenly assumed to belong to a chosen redshift range .",

    "as already anticipated , all the sources included in our analysis present an intense star forming activity , with sfrs ranging from @xmath69 @xmath1/yr up to values of the order of a few @xmath70/yr , with the possible exception of the martin et al .",
    "( 2012 ) sample , which probably includes less active objects .",
    "we also note that all the works presented here are truly sfr - selected samples , either because most of the stellar light in these rapidly star - forming objects is dominated by a young population and so the observed luminosities depend weakly on the stellar mass ( as is the case of galaxies selected in the mid / far - ir ) , because they are detected purely on emission from gas rather than stars ( as for hi emitters ) , or because the stellar mass limits are always sufficiently deep that all galaxies above the sfr limits are included in each sample ( as for magliocchetti & maddox 1999 and lin et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     sfrs for uv - selected sources were instead derived in two different ways : the first one , @xmath68=1.4\\times 10^{-28 } l_{\\nu}$][ergs / s / hz ] ( kennicutt 1998 ) , relies on the rest - frame uv luminosity and holds in the range [ 15002800]   for a salpeter imf .",
    "the second method instead follows that previously adopted for infrared - selected sources and estimates the sfr from integration of the full spectral energy distribution ( arp220-like sed ) , normalized to the observed @xmath71 .",
    "not surprisingly , the two estimates do not agree with each other .",
    "in fact , the first method does not take into account dust extinction , proven to be very relevant especially in the redshift range @xmath72 $ ] ( e.g. burgarella et al . 2013 ) , and may therefore return values for the sfrs which are strongly underestimated .",
    "for instance , reddy et al . (",

    "we note that , even in the most conservative case , we find sfrs @xmath75 m@xmath54/yr .",

    "the correlation lengths @xmath25 resulting from the above analysis are reported in table 1 and plotted in figure 1 as a function of the average redshift of each considered survey .",

    "could this dichotomy be the result of some selection bias ?",
    "hardly so .",
    "first of all , we remind that within each class , galaxies at the different redshifts are observed at the same rest - frame wavelength so that the selection is as homogeneous as possible . furthermore",

    "there is a hint for brighter objects within the same selection class to be clustered more strongly than fainter ones ( brodwin et al .",
    "2008 ; lin et al . 2012 )",
    "but , as it is clear from figure 1 , this is a second - order effect which does not affect the present discussion .",
    "this result also holds if instead of threshold luminosities one uses luminosity intervals ( as it was done in lin et al .",
    "2012 ) : in fact , also in this case one has that , above sfr@xmath107 @xmath1/yr galaxies show strong clustering regardless of their intrinsic luminosity .    similarly , the clustering strengths of @xmath10 star - forming galaxies are strikingly alike irrespective of the selection criterion and of the sfr . indeed , _",
    "herschel _ galaxies with sfr @xmath109 @xmath1/yr ( van kampen et al .",
    "2012 ; magliocchetti et al .",

    "furthermore , the global trend of @xmath25 in the whole @xmath2 $ ] range coincides with that observed within the homogeneous classes of far - ir - selected galaxies and uv - selected galaxies which , as shown in table 1 , are endowed with very similar bolometric luminosities and sfrs at all redshifts .",
    "we also note that the lin et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and possibly also the hdfn samples at @xmath18 include galaxies which have luminosities comparable to @xmath10 sources .",

    "the correlation length provides a direct way to estimate the total masses of the haloes where the sources producing the clustering signal reside . however , the relationship between these two quantities is not straightforward , and different approaches have been proposed in the literature leading to different mass estimates based on the same data .",
    "for example , the halo occupation model ( hom ; see e.g. scoccimarro et al . 2001 ) , used by magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , yields values of @xmath112 which are similar to those obtained from n - body simulations ( method used by starikova et al . 2012 and brodwin et al .",
    "2008 ) , but systematically lower than those given by the halo bias formalism of mo & white ( 1996 ) and sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) , adopted by magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2011 ; 2013 ) , hikcox et al . ( 2012 ) , lin et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and heinis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , as a general rule , within the hom ( which provides analytical fitting formulae to n - body simulations ) dark matter haloes are populated following laws of the kind : + @xmath113 + where n(m ) is the number of galaxies within a halo of some mass m , and the parameters @xmath114 and m@xmath115 are anti - correlated , in the sense that higher values for @xmath114 correspond to lower values for m@xmath115 .",
    "this implies that in the presence of multiple halo occupancy , the values for m@xmath115 found within the hom scenario will be lower than those obtained via the halo bias model .",
    "magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the difference in the mass estimates coming from the halo bias and hom approaches is of about 0.5 dex both at high ( @xmath18 ) and lower ( @xmath9 ) redshifts .    in order to homogenize the results , we have then decided to use as a reference model that of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) , which provides a working frame that is very similar to that of mo & white ( 1996 ) .",
    "although the hom approach , which also considers the distribution of galaxies within their dark matter haloes , would in principle be preferable , in practice there are non - trivial complications because it requires a precise knowledge of the behaviour of the two - point correlation function on small scales .",
    "it is therefore unapplicable to all those datasets which do not include a large enough number of sources , as is the case of most high - redshift surveys .",
    "the adopted approach is nevertheless valid since : 1 ) the main aim of our analysis is to compare results coming from different samples so that any possible bias in the determination of @xmath112 is not crucial as long as all the mass estimates are evenly affected by it ; and 2 ) the halo bias model still provides estimates of a physical quantity which is the mass of the parent halo where the galaxies reside as opposed to that of the galactic sub - haloes .",
    "the linear halo bias corresponding to the different sets of sources at the various redshifts can be simply written as : @xmath116 , \\label{eq : bias}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the mean redshift of the considered sample , @xmath118 is the cosmological growth factor , @xmath119 is given by eq .",
    "( 4 ) and @xmath120 ( see section 1 ) is the corresponding local value for the dark matter .",
    "the observed bias can then be compared to its theoretical value , obtained at the same redshift as a function of @xmath112 ( sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "such a comparison returns the values of the minimum masses of the parent haloes hosting the galaxies under exam .",
    "the variation of @xmath112 with cosmic epoch is illustrated in figure  2 , where both symbols and colour coding are as in figure  1 .",
    "the plot shows that the clear dichotomy seen in the values of the clustering amplitude in the low and in the high redshift regime can not be accounted for by the redshift evolution of the bias factor at * a * fixed halo mass . while the ( small ) scatter amongst different measurements within each of the two redshift ranges can be easily explained by different selection techniques , different star formation rates ( compare , e.g. lin et al .",
    "2012 and brodwin et al .",
    "2008 ) , and peculiarities in the redshift distribution of the sources ( as in van kampen et al .",
    "2012 who find a peak in the distribution at @xmath121 which enhances the amplitude of their correlation function ) , the much larger discrepancy between @xmath112 values at low and high redshifts can only be attributed to different intrinsic properties of the populations of star forming galaxies .",
    "high-@xmath21 star - forming galaxies are hosted by very massive , @xmath122 @xmath1 , cluster - like structures , while in the nearby universe even large sfrs ( sfr@xmath123 @xmath1/yr ) are associated to much less massive , @xmath124 @xmath1 , haloes .    furthermore , from those works which include highly complete samples ( e.g. magliocchetti & maddox 1999 , magliocchetti et al . 2008 , 2011 , 2013 and lin et al .",

    ", we can conclude that the overwhelming majority of dark matter haloes which reach the threshold mass necessary to host a star - forming galaxy at high redshifts will be inhabited by ( at least ) one of such objects .",
    "in other words , massive star - forming galaxies at redshifts around 2 are a widespread event , their observed paucity being simply due to the paucity of high mass dark matter haloes at the considered redshifts .",
    "since the above samples contain sources selected in redshift ranges @xmath127 , this implies a life - time for this intense star - forming phase at @xmath18 of about 1 gyr .    on the other hand , in the local universe only a fraction of ( the much smaller and therefore much more numerous ) virialized haloes will host a powerful star - forming event , and this fraction",
    "is found to decrease to lower redshifts ( cfr magliocchetti et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "if we assume a linear downsizing trend , we can parametrize the mass dependence of the star - forming galaxy population on look - back time as @xmath128[@xmath129=\\alpha \\cdot z+\\beta$ ] , with @xmath130 and @xmath131 . the fit is reproduced in figure 2 by the dashed line .",

    "2012 ) have investigated the cosmic evolution of a specific galaxy population via comparison of clustering measurements at low and high redshifts .",
    "our approach is however different , since we will not investigate such an evolution in a `` blind way '' , i.e. by extrapolating halo masses at lower redshifts and looking for matching values in the galaxy zoo .",

    "halo masses obtained with a mo & white ( 1996 ) formalism were directly provided by the authors in the two latter cases , while li et al .",
    "( 2006 ) provide estimates for the bias factor @xmath146 , which can be easily converted into minimum halo masses by following the approach described in section 4 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "filled diamonds are for the li et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample , the lower point representing the lower stellar mass interval , while open stars are for the results by furusawa et al .",

    "( 2010 ) .    in spite of some scatter ,",
    "minimum halo masses between @xmath147 and @xmath148 m@xmath54 are found for all the samples .",
    "this range of values perfectly mirrors those derived for the @xmath52 , actively star - forming galaxies previously considered in this work .",
    "we note that , although halo masses are expected to increase with time , for haloes of @xmath149 , the evolution between z=2 and z=0 is relatively modest ( 0.5 dex or so ; e.g. fakhouri et al .",
    "2010 ) , and thus comparable or smaller than the scatter between the points given in figure 3 .",
    "the above similarity strongly points to an evolutionary link between vigorous star - forming galaxies at @xmath52 and @xmath13 passively - evolving sources with a large stellar mass content .",
    "we have highlighted a striking dichotomy in the clustering amplitude of very active star - forming galaxies ( sfrs ranging from @xmath69 @xmath1/yr up to a few @xmath150 @xmath1/yr ) at low and high redshifts ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) .",
    "the comoving clustering radii , estimated in a uniform way , are approximately constant within each redshift range but jump by about a factor of 3 from @xmath151 ( where they are 46 mpc ) to @xmath152 ( where they range from @xmath153 to @xmath154 mpc ) .",
    "we argue that this leap can not be due to some selection bias or to the luminosity dependence of the clustering amplitude .",
    "the variation of the clustering signal is reflected in the distribution of halo masses .",
    "regardless of the chosen selection criterion , * all * high-@xmath21 galaxies undergoing an intense process of star formation are hosted by very massive , @xmath122 @xmath1 , cluster - like structures , while in the nearby universe even large sfrs ( @xmath155 @xmath1/yr ) are associated to much smaller , @xmath124 @xmath1 , haloes .",
    "this implies that the actively star forming galaxy population observed at @xmath152 is not the same we see at @xmath151 .",
    "we argue that the lack of massive star - forming galaxies in the @xmath13 universe is due to a rather rapid ( characteristic timescale of the intense @xmath18 star - forming phase @xmath11  gyr ) evolution of the active @xmath12 population into passive sources with very large , @xmath14 m_\\odot$ ] , stellar masses .    we stress that the striking dichotomy observed in the physical properties of low - z and high - z galaxies undergoing intense star formation",
    "is confirmed at all wavelengths capable of probing the star formation regime .",
    "it is worth noticing though that high redshift galaxies with low - to - moderate star formation activity ( sfr@xmath156 m@xmath54/yr ) show a clustering behaviour which is different from that of their more active companions .",
    "in fact , these sources exhibit much smaller clustering lengths ( e.g. adelberger et al . 2005 ; xia et al . 2012",
    "; lin et al . 2012 ; viero et al . 2013 ) , comparable with those of their lower - redshift counterparts .",
    "this issue will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the above findings strongly argue against merging as the main trigger of the highly enhanced star - forming phase of galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , scenarios which envisage modest - sized merger - induced starbursts fail at reproducing the very large halo masses estimated from all the available clustering data . on the other hand , the observed space densities and",
    "inferred life - times of the star - burst phase disagree with those predicted by models which advocate mergers of large units as the primary driver of the phenomenon .",
    "the gap in the clustering data between @xmath105 and @xmath157 does not allow us to determine yet how the transition from the high - mass / high - redshift to the low - mass / low - redshift star - forming regime occurs : is it gradual or abrupt ?",
    "key information on this point will come from the large and deep surveys that will be provided by euclid and ska . +",
