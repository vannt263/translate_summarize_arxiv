    "carbon ( c ) exhibits various allotropes such as diamond , graphite , graphene , fullerene , and nanotubes @xcite . among these allotropes ,",
    "diamond , a metastable crystalline form of carbon , belongs to wide band gap semiconductors such as sic and gan .",
    "in addition , diamond exhibits high electric breakdown field , high thermal conductivity , high saturated electron drift velocity , high carrier mobility , and excellent thermal stability @xcite .",
    "due to superior electrical and thermal properties , as compared to si and other wide band gap semiconductors , diamond is considered as a promising material for devices which operate at very high voltages , frequencies , and temperature . however , diamond is not an efficient light emitter due to its indirect band gap nature . on the other hand ,",
    "one - dimensional carbon nanotubes exhibit a variety of electronic properties ranging from metallic to semiconducting @xcite , while graphene , a two - dimensional allotrope of carbon , has a band gap of zero .",
    "although light emitting devices were realized based on single - walled carbon nanotubes with direct gaps @xcite , their utility as a light source is limited by their nanometre scale size .",
    "recently , a great deal of attention has been paid to the prediction / discovery of new carbon allotropes .",
    "the process of cold compression of graphite @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite is known to produce many unknown phases of carbon , and extensive computational studies have been attempted to understand them in terms of their structural clarification .",
    "numerous carbon allotropes were suggested as candidates , such as m carbon @xcite , w carbon @xcite , body - centered tetragonal bct - c@xmath1 carbon @xcite , z carbon @xcite ( also named @xmath2c16-ii @xcite and cco - c8 @xcite ) , r carbon @xcite ( also named o carbon @xcite and h carbon @xcite ) , p carbon @xcite ( also named z4-a@xmath3b@xmath4 carbon @xcite ) , s carbon @xcite ( also named c carbon @xcite ) , f carbon @xcite ( also named j carbon @xcite ) , @xmath2c32 carbon @xcite , and m585 carbon @xcite .",
    "these allotropes form @xmath5 bonds and their structures are characterized by the topological arrangement of 4- , 5- , 6- , 7- , and 8-membered carbon rings @xcite , different from the cubic or hexagonal ( lonsdaleite ) phase of carbon .",
    "while most carbon allotropes are of indirect band gaps , some allotropes were proposed to be direct band gap semiconductors , for example , s carbon @xcite , z - aca @xcite , z - cacb @xcite , c carbon @xcite , fullerite c@xmath6 @xcite , t carbon @xcite , ty carbon @xcite , @xmath7-diamond @xcite , and @xmath82 carbon @xcite . although extensive studies were performed for the structural properties such as energetics , hardness , and phase transition , the electronic properties were not as well studied .",
    "semiconductors which can emit photons with wavelengths shorter than 350 nm have potential to be used in deep ultraviolet ( uv ) light emitting diodes ( leds ) and laser diodes ( lds ) .",
    "currently , algan alloys have been considered as candidates for deep uv light sources . although gan - based leds in the near uv range ( at 365 nm ) were successfully demonstrated @xcite , it is still a challenging issue to obtain high external quantum efficiencies in algan - based leds with wavelengths below 250 nm @xcite . for applications to leds and lds in a deep uv wavelength range , it is desirable to search for direct band gap carbon allotropes with the gap sizes comparable to that of diamond .    in this work ,",
    "we find direct band gap carbon allotropes in the form of superlattices through computational searches , based on a combined approach of global optimization and first - principles density functional calculations .",
    "the direct band gaps range from 5.6 to 5.9 ev , suitable for high power applications .",
    "the optical transitions at the threshold energy are comparable to that of gan , suggesting that the designed allotropes can serve as promising materials for a deep uv light source .",
    "we explored carbon allotropes with direct band gaps by using a combined computational approach @xcite of conformational space annealing ( csa ) @xcite for global optimization and first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "we used a variant of csa where the enthalpy of the system was minimized and the objective function was designed to promote the formation of a direct band gap .",
    "the enthalpy minimization and the analysis of electronic properties were performed within the framework of density functional theory .",
    "we used the functional form of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential and the projector augmented wave potentials @xcite , as implemented in the vasp code @xcite .",
    "the wave functions were expanded in plane waves with an energy cutoff of 600 ev , and an even higher energy cutoff of 800 ev was used at the final stage of optimization . without using any knowledge of known crystal structures of carbon , we optimized the degrees of freedom including atomic positions and lattice parameters for c systems with @xmath9 atoms per unit cell ( @xmath9 = 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 ) .",
    "the number of configurations was set to 50 in the population size of csa .",
    "from the extensive conformational search , we obtained many direct gap carbon allotropes with @xmath5-hybridized bonds .",
    "when visually inspected , we notice that some of the low - energy ones are represented by the superlattice structure of c(100)@xmath10/c(5 - 7 ) , where @xmath11 c(100 ) layers ( @xmath11 = 2 , 3 , and 4 for @xmath9 = 12 , 16 , and 20 , respectively ) and a defective layer denoted as c(5 - 7 ) are stacked in an alternating fashion ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the c(100 ) layers are almost identical to their corresponding layers of diamond along the [ 100 ] direction ( here along the @xmath12-axis ) .",
    "the c(5 - 7 ) and its neighboring c(100 ) layers form alternating 5- and 7-membered rings along the @xmath13-axis .",
    "recently , we reported si superlattices with direct and quasidirect band gaps @xcite , where multiple si(111 ) layers and a defective layer containing seiwatz chains are stacked in a similar fashion as in c(100)@xmath10/c(5 - 7 ) . in the si superlattices , however , the si layers are oriented along the [ 111 ] direction and the 5 - 8-type rings are formed in the defective region .        for superlattices with odd @xmath11",
    ", we found the same bravais lattice , simple monoclinic , with the space group @xmath14 ( table  [ t1 ] ) . on the other hand , two types of superlattices ( referred to as type - i and type - ii )",
    "exist for even @xmath11 , depending on the relative positions of defective layers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath15 vectors differ by @xmath16 between type - i and type - ii .",
    "the type - i ( type - ii ) bravais lattice is a base - centered ( body - centered ) orthorhombic lattice , with the space group of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we note that 6 out of 10 superlattices in table  [ t1 ] were previously reported separately @xcite .",
    "however , no systematic understanding of the structural variations of the superlattices in terms of @xmath11 and the dependence of bravais lattice on the defective layers was attempted previously . here",
    "we explicitly investigate the optical performance of these superlattices in a systematic way .",
