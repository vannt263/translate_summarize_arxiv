    "indeed , temperature affects the tunneling current through the suppression of the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath0 , i.e.  broadening of the spectral function .",
    "a broader spectral function entails a more relaxed energy conservation in the tunneling processes , and thus the collinear peak widens around its zero - temperature , geometrically - deduced position .",

    "[ fig : broadening ] we plot the broadening of the current peak as a function of the misalignment angle @xmath18 for various temperatures .",

    "we study the interplay between the misalignment angle and the quasiparticle lifetime .    the profile of the tunneling current as a function of the bias voltage is characterized by peaks which originate from the enhanced tunneling probability between electronic states with collinear wave vectors in the two layers .",
    "due to electron - electron interactions , the broadening of these peaks depends on temperature at small misalignment angles . in this regime , comparing experimental data with our theoretical results enables measurements of the quasiparticle lifetime @xmath0 in a vertical transport experiment . at very low temperatures , instead , by tuning the gate voltage , it is possible to reach a regime in which the height of one current peak is entirely determined by the quasiparticle lifetime due to elastic scattering .",
    "both effects disappear when the misalignment angle @xmath18 is larger than @xmath134-@xmath135 , because , in this case , the width of the current peaks is dominated by the non - conservation of in - plane wave vector during the tunneling process .",

    "<S> tunneling of quasiparticles between two nearly - aligned graphene sheets produces resonant current - voltage characteristics because of the quasi - exact conservation of in - plane momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we claim that , in this regime , vertical transport in graphene / boron nitride / graphene heterostructures carries precious information on electron - electron interactions and the quasiparticle spectral function of the two - dimensional electron system in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we present extensive microscopic calculations of the tunneling spectra with the inclusion of quasiparticle lifetime effects and elucidate the range of parameters ( inter - layer bias , temperature , twist angle , and gate voltage ) under which electron - electron interaction physics emerges . </S>"
