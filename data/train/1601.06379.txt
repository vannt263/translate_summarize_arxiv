    "within the field of wave function - based theoretical chemistry , the size - extensive coupled cluster  @xcite ( cc ) hierarchy , which consists of the ccsd  @xcite , ccsdt  @xcite , ccsdtq  @xcite , etc . , models with single ( s ) , double ( d ) , triple ( t ) , quadruple ( q ) , etc . , excitations ,",
    "is undoubtedly the most successful family of methods for the treatment of many - body effects in atoms and molecules . while the ccsd and , to some extent",
    ", the ccsdt models have nowadays become routinely applicable , a treatment of excitation levels higher than that of triples is often mandatory , e.g. , to the discipline of computational thermochemistry  @xcite or for the accurate determination of molecular equilibrium geometries  @xcite ( which , in turn , is intrinsically related to the determination of accurate first- and second - order properties , harmonic frequencies , potential energy surfaces , etc . ) . to a first and feasible approximation",
    ", the inclusion of connected quadruple excitations proves necessary .",
    "the full iterative ccsdtq model , however , exhibits a staggering asymptotic @xmath2 scaling ( where @xmath3 is a measure of the total system size ) , which in practice prevents it from routine applications for anything but atoms and small - sized molecules , although recent work has highlighted how the generally inferior convergence behavior of the model may be accelerated by performing sub - iterations of certain contributions to the higher - level cc amplitude equations  @xcite . for this reason , computationally tractable cc quadruples models , which exhibit reduced formal non - iterative scalings , have been devised using arguments rooted in perturbation theory . in a recent communication  @xcite , we performed a rigorous investigation of the potential of such non - iterative cc quadruples expansions  rationalized from either hartree - fock ( hf ) state - based many - body perturbation theory  @xcite ( mbpt ) or cc state - based perturbation theory  @xcite  to recover ccsdtq total energies for a test set of _ closed - shell molecules_. in summary , the study found that non - iterative cc models , in which a ccsd reference state energy is corrected for the combined effect of triple and quadruple excitations , are in general incapable of approximating the ccsdtq model to within acceptable accuracy .",
    "as examples of such models , we tested the mbpt - rationalized ccsd(tq@xmath4 )  @xcite and ccsd+tq@xmath5  @xcite models as well as the lowest - order models of the recently proposed ccsd(tq@xmath0 ) perturbation series  @xcite , which form a hierarchy of perturbative models converging from the ccsd energy onto the ccsdtq energy .",
    "in fact , these models , with the exception of the fourth - order ccsd(tq4 ) model , were found to exhibit absolute errors so large and erratic that they often did not even manage to improve upon the ccsd(t ) model  @xcite nor the higher - level models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) triples perturbation series  @xcite .",
    "the study thus underlined the fact that a full iterative account of triples effects  as in the ccsdt model  is integral before quadruples effects can be addressed .",
    "for this reason , the focus in the present study , which will deal with how perturbative cc quadruples expansions are capable of recovering ccsdtq total energies , not for closed - shell molecules , but rather for _ open - shell species _ such as atoms and organic radicals , will be limited to variants in which the ccsdt energy is corrected for the isolated effect of quadruple excitations . + in the first part of the present series  @xcite , we investigated the accuracy at which total energies of open - shell species are determined using cc perturbative triples expansions . in this second part , we wish to extend the analysis to cc perturbative quadruples expansions , with special attention given to the models of the recently proposed ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series , which  like the ccsd(tq@xmath0 ) series  forms a hierarchy of perturbative models , but now converging from the ccsdt energy , rather than the ccsd energy , onto the ccsdtq energy  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series is defined as an order expansion in the mller - plesset fluctuation potential of a bivariational ccsdtq energy lagrangian where , from a ccsdt zeroth - order expansion point , perturbative solutions of both the exponential ccsdtq amplitude equations and linear @xmath1-state equations are embedded into the energy corrections  @xcite .",
    "results will be reported for the second- through sixth - order models of the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series ; for the fifth- and sixth - order models ",
    "the ccsdt(q5 ) and ccsdt(q6 ) models , respectively  results for both closed- and open - shell systems are presented for the first time .",
    "furthermore , we will relate the potential of a given perturbative model to recover total ccsdtq energies to its potential as a tool in computational thermochemistry , with an initial application to simple total atomization energies ( taes ) . in this respect ,",
    "we note how all of thermochemistry is concerned with appropriately defined energy differences rather than total energies of molecules .",
    "thus , a prerequisite for the application of any given model is not necessarily to provide results of thermochemical accuracy ( i.e. , within the sub - kj / mol range ) for total energies , but rather to achieve this level of accuracy for relative energy differences .    in ref .",
    ", taes were calculated for a test set of small - sized closed - shell molecules . however , transient species , e.g. , open - shell atoms and radicals , are omnipresent in some of the fields that rely most strongly on accurate thermochemical data , such as combustion and atmospheric chemistry , and while most closed - shell molecules are amenable to experimental characterization , this is not the case for open - shell species , for which the experimental error bars are typically significantly larger  @xcite . for this reason , high - level _ ab initio _ computational chemistry",
    "has a significant role to play in the field of thermochemistry , not only as a supplement to experimental laboratory work , but also as a generally practical and viable approach in the case of transient species . as noted previously in ref .",
    ", calculations of total energies for various closed- and open - shell species may potentially benefit from cancellations of different types of errors . however , for any theoretical method to be truly reliable , its errors  both in terms of sources and magnitude  have to be balanced between calculations on closed- and open - shell species",
    ". phrased differently , if pronounced and unsystematic discrepancies exist for a given model in its description of total energies for closed- and/or open - shell species , said model will owe its performance ( good or bad ) for relative quantities , such as thermochemical parameters , as much to fortuitous and unpredictable error cancellations as to theoretical rigor .",
    "+ in the present work , we will compare the performance of the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models for both total and atomization energies ( calculated in modest - sized basis sets of double-@xmath6 quality ) to the ccsdt(q )  @xcite and @xmath1ccsdt(q )  @xcite models .",
    "however , since we want to report open - shell results for both unrestricted hf ( uhf ) and restricted open - shell hf ( rohf ) trial functions  @xcite , we note that the generalization of the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model to both sets of references is unambiguous , unlike for the ccsdt(q ) model , for which , in the case of an rohf reference , two variants have been proposed in the literature  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we will only compare the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models to the ccsdt(q ) model for uhf references .",
    "all of the perturbative cc quadruples expansions tested here are based on the ccsdt model , either for a uhf or a ( semicanonical ) rohf reference  @xcite , and compared against the ccsdtq model for a general single - reference determinant  @xcite . while the ccsdtq model scales iteratively as @xmath2 , the formal scaling of the ccsdt(q ) and @xmath1ccsdt(q ) models",
    "is only @xmath7 , although for the latter of the models , both the ccsdt amplitude and @xmath1-state equations  @xcite have to be converged prior to the evaluation of the actual quadruples correction .",
    "all of the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models , on the other hand , scale non - iteratively as @xmath2 , with an increasing number of cost - determining contractions appearing at higher orders upon moving up through the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series .",
    "for example , for the difficult closed - shell ozone molecule , the increase in compute time over the ccsdt solution was previously found to be approximately a factor of 2 ( 4 ) and 4 ( 7 ) for the ccsdt(q ) and @xmath1ccsdt(q ) models , respectively , in a cc - pvdz ( cc - pvtz ) basis  @xcite , with obvious larger factors for the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models , cf .",
    "the cost discussion in ref . .",
    "however , comparing the cost of the ccsdt(q3 ) and ccsdt(q4 ) models , for instance , to that of the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model , revealed how the total time - to - solution was only increased by a factor of 5 and 10 , respectively , for the evaluation of the former two corrections over the latter in a cc - pvtz basis , and less so in the smaller cc - pvdz basis  @xcite .",
    "+ the numerical performance of each of the models is reported on par with ref .",
    ", namely in terms of * ( i ) * the relative recovery of the contribution to the ccsdtq correlation energy from quadruple excitations ( i.e. , the ccsdtq  ccsdt correlation energy difference ) and * ( ii ) * the actual deviation from this difference .",

    "furthermore , the three different curves for rhf , uhf , and rohf are remarkably similar , even more so than what was previously observed for the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series in ref . .",
    "in fact , it is instructive to compare the results for the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) and ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series _ vis -  - vis_. this is done in figure [ comparison_figure ] , in which size - intensive recoveries as well as total deviations for all three hf references are compared next to one another for both series ( for the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series , recoveries and deviations are plotted with respect to the triples contribution to the ccsdt correlation energy ) . as is obvious from comparing the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series in figures [ t_n_comparison_rec_figure ] and [ t_n_comparison_diff_figure ] with the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series in figures [ q_n_comparison_rec_figure ] and [ q_n_comparison_diff_figure ] , the latter converges at a slightly faster rate than the former , most likely due to the smaller magnitude of the contribution from quadruple excitations in the ccsdtq model than the contribution from triple excitations in the ccsdt model ( note the different axes used in figures [ t_n_comparison_diff_figure ] and [ q_n_comparison_diff_figure ] ) . upon moving up through either of the two hierarchies ,",
    "however , an identical behavior is observed , for recoveries as well as total deviations ; for instance , at the fourth - order level ( the ccsd(t4 ) and ccsdt(q4 ) models ) , a relative error against either of the target energies ( ccsdt and ccsdtq ) of less than @xmath8 percentage points is observed for all hf reference functions ( figures [ t_n_comparison_rec_figure ] and [ q_n_comparison_rec_figure ] , respectively ) .",

    "for instance , the standard deviations of the models , in particular for the closed - shell , but also for the open - shell test set , are unacceptably large . for the closed - shell results in figure [ q_n_abs_diff_rhf_figure ] , the statistical results for all of the models ( also those of the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series )",

    "the error bars show the standard error of the mean , and for the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model , the standard error is depicted as in figure [ q_n_figure].,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.47 , with o@xmath9 omitted ) and open - shell ( figure [ ae_open_figure ] ) species . in both figures ,",

    "the error bars show the standard error of the mean , and for the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model , the standard error is depicted as in figure [ q_n_figure].,title=\"fig : \" ]    as mentioned in section [ intro_section ] , for any approximate method  be it non - iterative or iterative in the computationally cost - determining step  to be of chemical relevance for high - accuracy applications , it must achieve an acceptable level of accuracy for relative energy differences . as",
    "such , it matters not how accurate the given method is in calculating total electronic energies , since there might exist a number of common sources for potential disagreements with higher - level references , which might , in turn , lead to beneficial error cancellations .",
    "however , for such cancellations of errors to be successful , the errors will not only have to be of similar magnitude , as they must also be of equal sign in - between calculations .",
    "for instance , a discrepancy in the accuracy ( against a well - defined yardstick , such as the ccsdtq model ) with which a method calculates total energies for closed- and open - shell species will ultimately result in unpredictable and unsystematic errors for relative calculations that involve both types of species .",
    "in other words , a given method will have to be balanced for a variety of species , which might differ in spin , charge , molecular distortion , or the energetic gap between the ground state and possible low - lying excited states ( i.e. , degeneracy effects ) .",
    "thus , in the present context , one can not discard , e.g. , the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model ( or _ vice versa _ favor the higher - level ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models ) exclusively on the basis of results for total energies like the ones presented in figure [ q_n_figure ] .",
    "for this reason , we present ( in figure [ ae_figure ] ) @xmath1ccsdt(q ) and ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) taes , based on the results in figure [ q_n_figure ] , i.e. , for the same two test sets ( o@xmath9 omitted from the closed - shell test set ) , and reported in terms of the total deviation from results obtained with the ccsdtq model ( for both the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) and ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) results in figure [ ae_closed_figure ] , the uhf- and rohf - based results ( uhf or rohf references used in the atomic calculations ) are similar to such an extent that they are practically indistinguishable ) . as is clear  despite generally performing better than the ccsdt(q ) model  the errors of the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model are substantial , even more so than for the total energies in figures [ q_n_abs_diff_rhf_figure ] , [ q_n_abs_diff_uhf_figure ] , and [ q_n_abs_diff_rohf_figure ] .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the results in figure [ q_n_figure ] , the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) results for the closed - shell test set are now in worse agreement with the ccsdtq reference energies than those for the open - shell test set ( even with the o@xmath9 outlier omitted from the statistical results ) , in particular in terms of standard errors , as a direct consequence of the unbalanced treatments of closed - shell molecules and open - shell atoms provided by the model .",
    "for the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models , however , the convergence trends onto the ccsdtq results are even more pronounced than in figure [ q_n_figure ] . as was discussed in ref . in connection with the closed - shell test set ,",
    "the ccsdt(q3 ) model is practically converged onto the ccsdtq limit for taes , which is encouraging , since the model is still only of moderate cost with respect to the native ccsdtq model , albeit markedly more costly than , e.g. , the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model ( cf .",
    "the discussion in section [ com_details_section ] ) .",
    "thus , while the model clearly benefits from cancellations of errors , as it does not account for the quadruples relaxation effects included at higher orders in the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series  @xcite , it seems  on the basis of the present study at least  to offer an _ a priori _ balanced description of quadruples effects in calculations of relative energy differences for a variety of molecular species , at a reasonable compromise between accuracy and cost , in much the same manner as the ccsd(t4 ) model of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) triples series was found to do for triples effects in the first part of the present series  @xcite .",
    "in the first part of the present series  @xcite , the potential of various perturbative cc triples expansions to recover total ccsdt energies for open - shell species was assessed . in this second part",
    ", the investigation has been extended to the study of perturbative cc quadruples expansions .",
    "in particular , the second- through sixth - order models of the recently proposed ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series of quadruples models have been compared to the established ccsdt(q ) and @xmath1ccsdt(q ) models by * ( i ) * evaluating frozen - core / cc - pvdz total energies against ccsdtq reference results for two test sets consisting of 18 atoms and small radicals and 17 closed - shell molecules , and * ( ii ) * comparing taes obtained with the same models to ccsdtq reference results .    in summary",
    ", we find that both in terms of the size - intensive recovery of the quadruples contribution to ccsdtq correlation energy , i.e. , the ccsdtq ",
    "ccsdt energy difference , as well as the total deviation from this , the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models all outperform the ccsdt(q ) and @xmath1ccsdt(q ) models , with the exception of the lowest - order ccsdt(q2 ) model .",
    "the same practical convergence trend onto the target energy ( that of the ccsdtq model ) is observed as was previously reported in ref . for the ccsd(t@xmath0 )",
    "triples models onto the ccsdt energy .",
    "while there exist pronounced differences in the description of closed- and open - shell species for the ccsdt(q ) and @xmath1ccsdt(q ) models , the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models are found to perform equally well for both test sets , irrespective of the reference determinant used in the open - shell calculations ( uhf or rohf ) . upon testing how stable either of the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) or ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models",
    "are by calculating taes for all the members of the two test sets , the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) results are found to be substantially in error and nowhere near those of the third- and higher - order ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models .",
    "for the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series , on the other hand , we observe a rapid convergence onto the ccsdtq reference results .",
    "thus , while we note that more appropriate ( e.g. , truly isodesmic  @xcite or even homodesmotic  @xcite ) reaction schemes exist for the determination of thermochemical quantities , it will not always be feasible to construct such hypothetical reactions ( radicals can be difficult in this regard ) , and in any case , the present comparison in terms of taes reports the worst possible errors which , for the third- and higher - order models of the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series , are found to be minor ( both relative to ccsdtq as well as on an absolute scale ) .",
    "furthermore , the present study highlights that in order to practically eliminate the remaining uncertainty ( that is , make the standard errors diminish for any non - iterative quadruples model ) , a truly advanced description of quadruples relaxation effects is called for .",
    "however , since such a description is only found in the higher - level models of the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) series , and since traversing higher up through this hierarchy than , say , the level of the ccsdt(q5 ) and ccsdt(q6 ) models would make the actual savings with respect to the native ccsdtq calculation negligible , we argue that models such as the ccsdt(q3 ) and ccsdt(q4 ) models will have to suffice as adequate compromises between accuracy and computational cost .",
    "indeed , if even larger errors than those encountered at these levels are acceptable , then , for instance , the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model is an ideal candidate , giving reasonable results ( e.g. , better than the ccsdt(q ) model ) at a relatively low cost .",
    "however , our findings lead us to stress that this model , established as it might be , is clearly not balanced in the description of closed- and open - shell species , in much the same way as was previously observed for the ccsd(t ) triples model in the first part of this series . thus",
    ", despite its unambiguous formulation for both rhf , uhf , and rohf references , the @xmath1ccsdt(q ) model might occasionally provide answers that are significantly in error with respect to higher - level cc models .",
    "finally , one might argue that the errors affiliated with the choice of basis set in the present study ( cc - pvdz ) are bound to be in excess of the error bars for , e.g. , the taes in figure [ ae_figure ] .",
    "however , accurate calculations of quadruples effects in anything larger than basis sets of double-@xmath6 quality have unfortunately not yet become standard protocol , and we note that ccsdtq calculations of this very type ( i.e. , limited to the cc - pvdz basis set ) are integrated parts of various composite thermochemical models , which is one of the premier domains in which an account of quadruples effects is mandatory . for this reason , and in combination with the minimal basis set",
    "dependence previously observed for the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models in ref .",

    "<S> the discrepancy between them is found to be even more pronounced , stressing how a balanced description of both closed- and open - shell species  as found in the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) models  is indeed of paramount importance if any perturbative cc model is to be of chemical relevance for high - accuracy applications . in particular , the third - order ccsdt(q3 ) model is found to offer an encouraging alternative to the existing choices of quadruples models used in modern computational thermochemistry , since the model is still only of moderate cost , albeit markedly more costly than , e.g. , the ccsdt(q ) and @xmath1ccsdt(q ) models . </S>"
