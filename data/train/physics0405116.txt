    "the phenomena of field reversal of the axial electric field in the negative glow of a dc discharge is of great importance , since the fraction of ions returning to the cathode depends on its existence and location",
    ". technological application of gas discharges , particularly to plasma display panels , needs a better knowledge of the processes involved .",
    "the study of nonlocal phenomena in electron kinetics of collisional gas discharge plasma have shown that in the presence of field reversals the bulk electrons in the cathode plasma are clearly separated in two groups of slow electrons : trapped and free electrons@xcite . trapped",
    "electrons give no contribution to the current but represent the majority of the electron population .",
    "the first field reversal it was shown qualitatively to be located near the end of the negative glow ( ng ) where the plasma density attains the greatest magnitude . if the discharge length is enough , it appears a second field reversal on the boundary between the faraday dark space and the positive column .",
    "also , it was shown in the previously referred theoretical work that ions produced to the left of this first reversal location move to the cathode by ambipolar diffusion and ions generated to the right of this location drift to the anode . for a review see also  @xcite .",
    "those characteristic were experimentally observed by laser optogalvanic spectroscopy  @xcite .",

    "@xcite with a simple fluid model gave an analytical expression of the field reversal location which showed to depend solely on the cathode sheath length , the gap length , and the ionization relaxation length .",
    "they obtained as well a simple analytical expression giving the fraction of ions returning to the cathode and the magnitude of the plasma maximum density .    in the present letter",
    "we introduce a quite simple dielectric - like model of a plasma - sheath system .",
    "this approach have been addressed by other authors  @xcite to explain how the electrical field inversion occurs at the interface between the plasma sheath and the beginning of the negative glow .",
    "the aim of this letter is to obtain more information about the fundamental properties related to field inversion phenomena in the frame of a dielectric model .",
    "it is obtained a simple analytical dependence of the axial location where field reversal occurs in terms of macroscopic parameters . in addition , it is obtained the magnitude of the minimum electric field inside the through , the trapped well length , and the trapping time of the slow electrons into the well .",
    "we emphasize in particular the description of the dielectric behavior and do not contemplate plasma chemistry and plasma - surface interactions .",
    "the analytical results hereby obtained could be useful for hybrid fluid - particle models ( e.g. , fiala _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , since simple criteria can be applied to accurately remove electrons from the simulations .    on the ground of the stress - energy tensor considerations",
    "it is shown the inherent instability of the field inversion sheath .",
    "the slow electrons distribution function is obtained assuming the fermi  @xcite mechanism responsible for their acceleration from the trapping well .",
    "lets consider a plasma formed between two parallel - plate electrodes due to an applied dc electric field .",
    "we assume a planar geometry , but extension to cylindrical geometry is straightforward .",
    "the applied voltage is @xmath0 and we assume the cathode fall length is @xmath1 and the negative glow + eventually the positive column extends over the length @xmath2 , such that the total length is @xmath3 .",
    "we have @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , resp . , the electric fields in the sheath and ng ( possibly including the positive column ) .    at the end of the cathode sheath",
    "it must be verified the following boundary condition by the displacement field @xmath7 @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the surface charge density accumulated at the boundary surface and @xmath10 is the normal to the surface . in more explicit form , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , resp .",
    ", the electrical permittivity of the sheath and the positive column",
    ". we have to solve the following algebraic system of equations @xmath14 they give the electric field strength in each region @xmath15 here , we define @xmath16 .",
    "recall that in dc case , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 denoting the plasma frequency and @xmath20 the electron - neutral collision frequency .",
    "in fact , our assumption @xmath18 is plainly justified , since experiments have shown the occurrence of a significant gas heating and a corresponding gas density reduction in the cathode fall region , mainly due to symmetric charge exchanges processes which lead to an efficient conversion of electrical energy to heavy - particle kinetic energy and thus to heating  @xcite .",
    "two extreme cases can be considered : * i * ) @xmath21 , implying @xmath22 , meaning that @xmath23 , i.e , non - collisional regime prevails ; * ii * ) @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 , i.e , collisional regime dominates .    from the above eqs .",
    "[ eq6 ] we estimate the field inversion should occurs for the condition @xmath27 , which give the position on the axis where field inversion occurs : @xmath28    from eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] we can resume a criteria for field reversal : it only occurs in the non - collisional regime ; by the contrary , in the collisional regime and to the extent of validity of this simple model , no field reversal will occur , since the slow electrons scattering time inside the well is higher than the the well lifetime , and collisions ( in particular , coulombian collisions ) and trapping become competitive processes .",
    "a similar condition was obtained in  @xcite when studying the effect of electron trapping in ion - wave instability .",
    "likewise , a self - consistent analytic model  @xcite have shown that at at sufficiently high pressure , field reversal is absent .",
    "due to the accumulation of slow electrons after a distance @xmath29 , real charges accumulated on a surface separating the cathode fall region from the negative glow .",
    "naturally , it appears polarization charges on each side of this surface and a double layer is created with a surface charge @xmath30 on the cathode side and @xmath31 on the anode side .",
    "but , @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 denoting the dimensionless quantity called electric susceptibility .",
    "as the electric displacement is the same everywhere , we have @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the residual ( true ) surface charge in between is given by @xmath37 after a straightforward but lengthy algebraic operation we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 we can verify that @xmath9 must be equal to @xmath41 considering that @xmath42 , we determine the minimum value of the electric field at the reversal point : @xmath43    here , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 designating the relative permittivity of the plasma trapped in the well . from the above equation",
    "we can obtain a more practical expression for the electrical field at its minimum strength @xmath46 the magnitude of the minimum electric field depends on the length of the negative glow @xmath2 .",
    "this also means that without ng there is no place for field reversal , and also the bigger the length the minor the electric field .",
    "the length of the negative glow can be estimated by the free path length @xmath2 of the fastest electrons possessing an energy equal to the cathode potential fall value @xmath47 : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the electrons kinetic energy and @xmath50 is the stopping power . for example , for he , it is estimated @xmath51  @xcite ( in cm.torr units , with @xmath0 in volt ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the density of trapped electrons and by @xmath53 their respective temperature .",
    "altogether , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are , resp . , the electron density and electron temperature in the negative glow region .    by other side , we can estimate the true surface charge density accumulated on the interface of the two regions by the expression @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the total charge over the cross sectional area where the current flows and @xmath58 is the width of the potential well .      from eqs .",
    "[ eqsig ] and  [ eq15 ] it is easily obtained the trapping well width @xmath59 it is expected that the potential trough should have a characteristic width of the order in between the electron debye length ( @xmath60 ) and the mean scattering length .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ eq16 ] , in a he plasma and assuming @xmath61 kv , @xmath62 m and @xmath63 s@xmath64 ( with @xmath65 ev ) at 1 torr ( @xmath66 @xmath67 ) we estimate @xmath68 cm , while the debye length is @xmath69 cm .",
    "so , our eq .  [ eq16 ] gives a good order of magnitude for the potential width , which is expected to be in fact of the same order of magnitude than the debye length .",
    "table i present the set of parameters used to obtain our estimations .",
    "we give in table ii the estimate of the minimum electric field attained inside the well .",
    "the first field reversal at @xmath70 corresponds to the maximum density @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "so , the assumed values for the ratio of electron temperatures and densities of the trapped electrons and electrons on the ng are typical estimates .",

    "we obtain @xmath75    then , we have @xmath76    in table iv we summarize scattering and trapping times for a few gases .      as slow electrons are trapped by the electric field inversion",
    ", some process must be at work to pull them out from the well .",
    "we suggest that fluctuations of the electric field in the plasma ( with order of magnitude of @xmath77)act over electrons giving energy to the slow ones , which collide with those irregularities as with heavy particles . from this mechanism",
    "it results a gain of energy as well a loss .",
    "this model was first advanced by e. fermi  @xcite when developing a theory of the origin of cosmic radiation .",
    "we shall focus here on the rate at which energy is acquired .",
    "the average energy gain per collision by the trapped electrons ( in order of magnitude ) is given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 and where @xmath49 is their kinetic energy .",
    "after @xmath80 collisions the electrons energy will be @xmath81 with @xmath82 being their thermal energy , typical of slow electrons .",

    "[ 7 ] ) , hence @xmath91 , with @xmath92 as a reasonable guess .",
    "hence , we estimate the trapping time to be @xmath93    fig.1 shows the slow electrons distribution function pumped out from the well for two cases : ar ( solid curve ) , and n@xmath94 ( broken curve ) .",
    "it was chosen a power exponent @xmath95 .",
    "those distributions show that the higher confining time is associated with less slow electrons present in the well .",
    "when the width of the well increases ( from solid to broken curve ) the scattering time become longer , and as well the confining time , due to a decrease of the relative number of slow electrons per given energy .",
    "this mechanism of pumping out of slow ( trapped ) electrons from the well can possibly explains the generation of electrostatic plasma instabilities .",
    "note that the trapping time is , in fact , proportional to the length of the ng and inversely proportional to the electrons diffusion coefficient at thermal energies : @xmath96 the survival frequency of trapped electrons is @xmath97 .",
    "as the electrons diffusion coefficient are typically higher in atomic gases , it is natural to expect plasma instabilities and waves with higher frequencies in atomic gases .",
    "this result is in agreement with a kinetic analysis of instabilities in microwave discharges  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the length of the ng will influence the magnitude of the frequencies registered by the instabilities , since wavelengths have more or less space to build - up .",
    "table  [ table 4 ] summarizes the previous results for some atomic and molecular gases .",
    "the transport parameters used therefor where calculated by solving the electron boltzmann equation , under the two - term approximation , in a steady - state townsend discharge  @xcite",
    "we have shown in the framework of a simple dielectric model that the magnitude of the minimum electric field ( on the edge of the negative glow ) depends directly on the applied voltage and is inversely proportional to the ng length .",
    "the width of the well trapping the slow electrons is directly dependent on the applied electric field and is inversely proportional to the square of the electron - neutral collision frequency for slow electrons .",
    "it is , as well , inversely proportional to the ng length , and has typically the extension of a debye length .",
    "we state that for typical conditions of a low - pressure glow - discharge , field reversal occurs whenever @xmath21 , due to a lack of collisions necessary to pump out electrons from the well .",
    "furthermore , the analytical expressions obtained for the scattering and trapping time of the slow electrons are potentially useful in hybrid fluid - particle plasma modelling ."
