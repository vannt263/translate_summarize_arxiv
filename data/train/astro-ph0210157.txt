    "theory of stellar atmospheres is presently enjoying a period of revival .",
    "this renewed interest has several major reasons .    on the observational side ,",
    "there has been an unprecedented expansion of quantity and quality of stellar spectrophotometric observations .",
    "thanks to high sensitivity and high signal - to - noise ratio , one can now routinely record good - quality spectra of individual stars in other galaxies than the milky way , thus giving birth to a field of extragalactic stellar astronomy ( kudritzki 2000 ) .",
    "the importance of deriving accurate stellar parameters as significant constraints for the global galactic and cosmological parameters , coupled with the quality of observations , compels us to use as accurate and reliable model atmospheres as possible .    among all stellar types , the hot , massive , and bright stars  in particular o - type stars ,",
    "stand as one of the most important stellar groups in the global astronomical context .",
    "they contribute most of the radiation to the uv and optical integrated spectra of galaxies which still undergo a star - forming process .",
    "the o stars provide the majority of ionizing photons for regions , and the interstellar and intergalactic medium . in the cosmological context",
    ", there is still a debate whether hot massive stars or active galactic nuclei provided the necessary photons for the re - ionizing of the universe around @xmath6 . in view of forthcoming space missions , like the new generation space telescope",
    ", there is a growing interest in studying the early ( or even the first ) generation of stars in the universe ( see , e.g. , weiss et  al . 2000 ) .    on the modeling side ,",
    "the capabilities of the modeling methodology has advanced enormously .",
    "one obvious reason is a many - fold increase of computer speed and memory .",
    "another , and also very important , reason is the development of efficient and robust numerical methods . the central role in this respect",
    "is played by the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) method ( for a recent review , see hubeny 2003 ) .    with the development of fast computers and efficient numerical methods",
    ", the basic limiting factor is now becoming the accuracy ( and availability ) of atomic data .",
    "fortunately , great advances are being made in this direction too .",
    "recently , two major collaborative projects , the _ opacity project _ ( op ) ( seaton 1987 ; the opacity project team 1995 ; 1997 ) , its continuation the _ iron project _ ( hummer et al . 1993 ; pradhan et al .",
    "1996 ; nahar 2003 ) , and the _ opal _ project @xcite , have produced atomic data on a large scale .",
    "the time is thus ripe to compute a new grid of model stellar atmospheres .",
    "we need to analyze spectra of individual stars as well as composite spectra of galaxies , with much larger degree of complexity and accuracy than is provided by the @xcite spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) currently in use .    because of the importance of o - type stars , such a modeling effort is hardly new . however , there are three issues that make a construction of o star model atmospheres a highly non - trivial task",
    ". they are _",
    "( i ) _ the presence of a strong mass outflow , the stellar wind ; _ ( ii ) _ significant departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) ; and _ ( iii ) _ an effect of numerous metal lines , traditionally called metal line blanketing .",
    "at present , there are no models that would address all these three issues in full ( that is to construct fully blanketed , non - lte models for an entire atmosphere , going from essentially static photosphere out to the wind ",
    "the so - called unified models ) , although there are several research groups and several computer programs that are in principle capable of doing so  programs ( hillier & miller 1998 ; hillier 2003 ) ; hoeflich s suite of programs @xcite ; phoenix @xcite ; munich programs @xcite ; and the kiel - potsdam code ( hamann 1985 ; koesterke et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "as we will discuss in more detail in the next section , unified models either require huge computer resources , or one has to approximate the other two ingredients  nlte and line blanketing . also , a description of a stellar wind is still somewhat uncertain .",
    "it is therefore desirable to be able to construct complete models for hydrostatic layers , traditionally called the stellar photosphere .",
    "even this simplified problem is a tremendous task .",
    "early nlte model atmospheres @xcite considered only a few , about 10 , energy levels of h and he .",
    "likewise , only most important opacity sources were considered  several bound - free transition of h and he , and a few most important hydrogen lines . on the other hand ,",
    "both observations and lte line - blanketed models @xcite showed that the uv spectrum contain a huge number of metal , mostly iron , lines , which may then significantly influence not only the emergent spectral energy distribution , but the atmospheric structure in general .",
    "although it was clear that early nlte models provided a significantly improved predictions of line profiles of most important spectral lines ( see , e.g. , a number of papers in garmany 1990 ; crivellari , hubeny , & hummer 1991 ; heber & jeffery 1992 ) it was not clear what is most significant from the point of view of an overall model atmosphere accuracy  to compute nlte models without influence of metal line blanketing ( or with a very simplified blanketing ) , or to treat metal line blanketing as completely as possible , while making a sacrifice of neglecting nlte effects .",
    "@xcite has introduced an ingenious multi - frequency / multi - grey method , and was able to construct models with several tens to hundreds of energy levels and hundreds of lines treated explicitly . when the ali method was first implemented @xcite ,",
    "the number of lines that can be treated explicitly increased to thousands .",
    "@xcite used a concept of superlevels and superlines to describe effects of numerous lines of iron - peak elements . later",
    ", even more complex model atmospheres with improved treatment of metal line blanketing were constructed @xcite .",
    "the experience gained during the last decade taught us that both nlte and line blanketing are very important ; moreover , one needs to treat both to a very high degree of completeness in order to avoid spurious results .    with the recent improvements of numerical schemes and with extensive developments of computational resources that have occurred during the last decade we are now able to compute essentially `` exact '' , fully blanketed nlte hydrostatic model atmospheres .",
    "to fulfill this goal is the topic of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ assmethsect ]",
    "we summarize the basic physical assumptions and the numerical methods used to construct our model grid , and in  [ blanksect ] we specifically describe numerical approaches to treat the metal line blanketing .",
    "section [ atomsect ] is devoted to an overview of atomic data , and , in some cases , their approximations .",
    "section [ gridsect ] describes the ostar2002   model grid in more detail .",
    "some representative results are presented in ",
    "[ resusect ] , while global parameters such as the number of ionizing photons and a bolometric correction are discussed in  [ bcsect ]",
    ". section  [ errsect ] discusses a sensitivity of computed models to adopted parameters .",
    "our results are summarized in  [ conclsect ] .",
    "our basic physical assumptions are those of plane - parallel stratification , hydrostatic equilibrium , and radiative equilibrium .",
    "as has been pointed out in the literature repeatedly over the past three decades ( auer & mihalas 1969b ; mihalas 1978 , a number of papers in garmany 1990 ; crivellari , hubeny , & hummer 1991 ; heber & jeffery 1992 ; and hubeny , mihalas , & werner 2003 ) , the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , which is another typical approximations of classical model atmospheres , breaks down for early - type stars , in particular for o stars .",
    "we thus drop the approximation of lte and compute non - lte ( nlte ) models .      at the very outset",
    ", we have to clarify one crucial question .",
    "it is well known that the most common features of the uv spectra of o stars are strong p cygni profiles of numerous metal lines ( , , , , , , , etc . ) , which provide an unmistakable evidence of massive , supersonic outflows  the stellar winds .",
    "since our models are hydrostatic , we have to ask : are the hydrostatic model atmospheres for o stars relevant at all ?",
    "the answer depends on what exactly we are expecting from a model .",
    "if we intend to analyze the p cygni profiles , and to derive basic wind parameters ( mass loss rate , terminal velocity ) , then , obviously , the hydrostatic models at best provide lower boundary conditions .",
    "however , if we intend to derive the basic stellar parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity  therefore mass  , and chemical composition , from the bulk of the uv and optical spectrum ) , then the answer is that the hydrostatic models are not only useful , but in many cases actually preferable over the wind models or the unified ( photosphere + wind ) models with a simplified treatment of a photosphere .",
    "there are several reasons for this assessment .",
    "first , most spectral lines ( excluding strong , mostly resonance , lines ) are formed in the photosphere where velocities are small and geometrical extension is negligible .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of slowly - rotating o stars show mostly narrow and symmetric lines ( see , e.g. , the high - resolution uv spectral atlas of the o9v star , 10 lac , brandt et  al . 1998 ; and the quality of the fit of the hst spectra by our nlte line - blanketed models ",
    "hubeny , heap , & lanz 1998 ) .",
    "this statement is valid in all but the most extreme cases of stellar winds , like those observed in wolf - rayet stars and extreme of supergiants .",
    "moreover , winds are weaker in low - metallicity environments making photospheric models even more relevant in this case . the theoretical spectra predicted by the wind code cmfgen @xcite and by tlusty",
    "agree very well for a test case , @xmath2=35000k , @xmath7 , demonstrating that most lines are indeed formed in the quasi - static photosphere @xcite .",
    "second , there are many remaining uncertainties as to the exact properties of stellar winds of hot stars , even though the paradigm of radiatively - driven winds is well established .",
    "for example , we do not have in many cases a consistent solution : the calculated line force is often too small to drive a wind through the critical point ( though some progress is being made ) , so a @xmath8-type velocity law must be adopted to describe empirically the velocity and density structure of the wind .",
    "furthermore , radiative equilibrium is not really satisfied in these winds , where shocks dump mechanical energy and heat the wind , thus changing its ionization structure ( e.g. , super - ionization ) .",
    "finally , the assumption of one - dimensional geometry is challenged by the likely presence of dense clumps in the wind and by rotation ; the role of magnetic fields is not yet understood , and their importance in structuring the wind will very likely be more important than in the photosphere .",
    "third , there is also a practical aspect .",
    "spherical model atmospheres with velocity fields , although technically still a 1-d problem , have effectively a larger dimensionality than a plane - parallel static problem because of a sharp angular dependence of the radiation field .",
    "( recall that in spherical wind models , the number of angles is about the same as the number of discretized radial points , while in the plane - parallel case considering a few  typically 3  angles is usually sufficient ) .",
    "consequently , computing spherical expanding models is intrinsically more complex and more computationally intensive than plane - parallel models .",
    "one is thus forced either to compute fewer models , or to make approximations in the local physics ( in particular opacities ) , to reduce computer requirements to reasonable limits .    finally , it is important to realize that while line blanketing operates everywhere in the atmosphere , departures from hydrostatic equilibrium occur only in the outer layers .",
    "history has taught us that it is very dangerous to neglect or even to approximate metal line blanketing . neglecting line blanketing leads not only to a lower local temperature in the continuum - forming layers and thus to systematic errors in determining the effective temperature ( e.g. hubeny , heap & lanz 1998 ) , but also to errors in predicted ionization balance of important elements ( cno , etc . ) .",
    "these species provide in turn important diagnostic tools for the wind .",
    "since the ionization edges of cno and other light metals are located in the far and extreme uv , and since this region is crowded with numerous lines of highly ionized iron and nickel (-; - ) , any deficiencies in describing photospheric line blanketing are directly reflected in the uncertainties in the predicted wind structure .",
    "it is thus no exaggeration to say that without a proper and detailed treatment of photospheric metal line blanketing even sophisticated wind models may be seriously in error .",
    "therefore , we are on much safer ground to determine the fundamental parameters of massive stars as long as we use selected photospheric lines and avoid all uncertainties remaining with wind models .",
    "moreover , a grid of nlte line - blanketed model atmospheres incorporating state - of - the - art opacities will provide a sound basis for comparison to future , more realistic model atmospheres of o stars .      over the years , we have developed a computer program called tlusty   for computing model stellar atmospheres without assuming lte @xcite .",
    "the program solves the basic equations ",
    "radiative transfer , hydrostatic equilibrium , radiative equilibrium , statistical equilibrium , charge and particle conservation .",
    "these equations are discretized in frequency and depth , which yields a set of highly - coupled , non - linear algebraic equations .",
    "we have used in this work the so - called hybrid cl / ali method that was introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method builds on the advantages of both ali and complete linearization . through ali ,",
    "the mean intensities of the radiation field are eliminated from the set of linearized equations .",
    "however , the hybrid cl / ali method still allows us to linearize the radiation intensity at a few selected key frequencies , notably improving the convergence rate compared to a `` pure '' ali approach .",
    "the hybrid cl / ali method combines therefore the low cost of ali while retaining a convergence rate that is similar to cl .",
    "moreover , levels and superlevels may be grouped during the linearization step , reducing even further the number of linearized equations @xcite .",
    "the full statistical equilibrium is solved in a separate step , element by element , with a typical maximum number of levels around 200 per element .    under the above assumptions ,",
    "the critical ingredient of the models is a degree of completeness of the opacity sources , and of the atomic / ionic energy levels treated explicitly in the statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "we shall discuss these issues in more detail in the next two sections .",
    "as we have pointed out above , nlte line blanketing is an essential ingredient of realistic model atmospheres , determining the vertical temperature structure and the ionization structure .",
    "nlte ionization rates are typically larger than their lte counterparts , because the radiative rates are determined by the radiation field which is emitted in deeper , hotter layers .",
    "therefore , accurate mean intensities of the radiation field are required to evaluate correctly the nlte ionization structure , which in turn require an accounting of all sources of opacity .",
    "when neglecting in particular the opacity of fe lines , nlte models predict too strong euv / uv radiation fields , and overestimate the ionization and the importance of departures from lte .",
    "in order to construct realistic nlte model atmospheres , we have therefore included about 100,000 individual atomic levels of over 40 ions of h , he , c , n , o , ne , si , p , s , fe , and ni in the calculations . the levels are grouped into about 900 nlte superlevels , with populations of individual energy levels following boltzmann statistics inside a superlevel .",
    "all individual levels in a superlevel thus share the same nlte departure coefficient .",
    "@xcite discussed the concept of nlte superlevels in detail .",
    "a total of 8000 lines of the light elements and about 2 millions lines of feiii - vi and niiii - vi are accounted for in the calculations . based on a line strength criterion , fe and ni lines are dynamically selected from a total of 12 million lines listed by @xcite .",
    "the numbers of nlte levels and lines included in the model atmospheres are listed in table  [ iontbl ] .",
    "details of the model atoms are given in sect .",
    "[ atomsect ] .",
    "ali and level grouping are two major steps toward the practical realization of nlte line - blanketed model atmospheres .",
    "`` superlines '' , i.e. transitions between superlevels , are another important ingredient .",
    "a superline may involve hundreds or thousands of individual lines over a relatively broad frequency range .",
    "the resulting absorption cross - section is then very complex and a detailed representation may require a very large number of frequency points . in an early implementation of nlte line blanketing , @xcite adopted the concept of opacity distribution functions ( odfs ) to describe the absorption profile of superlines .",
    "the total opacity of all lines in a given transition ( computed using voigt profiles for each line ) is sorted ; the sorted opacities could then be represented with a limited number of frequencies , typically 15 to 30 per transition , or 30000 to 50000 frequencies for the whole spectrum .",
    "the odf approach assumes that the background opacity changes little over the frequency range covered by the superline .",
    "details of blends with other lines or continua are therefore lost ; however , this issue should not be serious in a statistical sense since this method is designed for millions of lines of the iron - peak elements .",
    "one may still unintentionally create or neglect blends between strong lines and odfs , thus affecting the resulting model atmospheres .",
    "we have therefore implemented a second method , opacity sampling ( os ) , that have the advantage of treating exactly the blends .",
    "os is a simple monte carlo - like sampling of the superline cross - sections .",
    "contrary to the odf approach , os may miss the cores of important strong lines if too few frequency points are used .",
    "we use a variant of os , sampling the whole spectrum at prescribed intervals in frequency .",
    "the typical sampling step is 0.75 fiducial doppler widths of fe .",
    "smaller steps are occasionally used to include light elements line cores in the frequency set as well as points around photoionization edges .",
    "our model atmospheres are sampled with 180000 to 200000 frequency points for an o star model .",
    "while costly in terms of computing requirements , we are thus sampling the spectrum with sufficient resolution to ensure that every line is accounted for .",
    "this is the current standard mode in tlusty , which was used to compute this grid of model atmospheres .",
    "@xcite presented some illustrations of the odf and os approaches . in sect .",
    "[ errsect ] , we show the changes in a typical model atmosphere that result from different representations of line opacities .",
    "the opacity project @xcite provides very extensive datasets for radiative transitions ( @xmath9-values , photoionization cross - sections ) which have been obtained from ab - initio calculations for all ions of the most abundant light species ( @xmath10 , s , ca , and fe ) .",
    "the current status of the project and its continuation as the iron project is discussed by @xcite .",
    "op claims that their data are accurate at the 10% level or better .",
    "we have adopted systematically these data for light elements and they form the bulk of radiative data used in tlusty .",
    "the op data have been extracted from topbase , the database of the opacity project @xcite .",
    "op also provides theoretical level energies . despite the sophistication of op calculations ,",
    "these energies still differ by a few percent from the energies measured in the laboratory . we have therefore updated the level energies with experimental energies when they are available in the atomic and spectroscopic database at nist @xcite .",
    "these large datasets are manipulated with modion , an idl - based graphic tool that works directly with topbase data files @xcite , to prepare the model atoms required by tlusty . for most lines ,",
    "we have adopted depth - independent doppler line profiles , with a standard temperature , t=0.75@xmath2 .",
    "depth - dependent , stark or voigt profiles are used for the strongest lines ( about 70 lines of light elements and the lower line series of and ) .",
    "radiative damping constants are extracted from the nist database , and stark widths are adopted from the work of dimitrijevic and collaborators .",
    "op photoionization cross - sections contain many autoionization resonances .",
    "as tlusty   handles large frequency sets , we could therefore adopt the theoretical op cross - sections in every detail .",
    "however , sharp resonances are not fully resolved by the op calculations .",
    "moreover , resonances are shifted off their exact wavelengths due to the limited accuracy of theoretical energies . therefore , we have followed @xcite and implemented the concept of resonance - averaged photoionization ( rap ) cross - sections .",
    "the cross - sections are smoothed by a gaussian with a width , @xmath11 , that corresponds to the typical uncertainty of the resonance energies .",
    "op photoionization cross - sections are total cross - sections for each initial state summed over all final states .",
    "we have kept this approximation : we assume that all bound - free transitions considered by tlusty   end up in to the ground state of the next ion .",
    "if the transition to the ground state is forbidden by selection rules , the cross - sections is shifted in energy corresponding to the excitation of the lowest excited state for which the transition is allowed .",
    "while the opacity and the ionization rate are thus computed correctly , the corresponding recombination rate ( based on detailed balance arguments ) is only approximate because it assumes that the end state of ionization is in boltzmann equilibrium with the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , since the population balance of the upper ion is determined by a large number of processes ( mostly bound - bound transitions ) , the influence of an approximate recombination rate is typically small , and the resulting error in the statistical equilibrium virtually negligible .",
    "additional details on the model atoms for each ion is given in the relevant subsections .",
    "for iron - peak elements , we have extracted level energies and line oscillator strengths from @xcite extensive semi - empirical calculations .",
    "@xcite lists thousands of energy levels for each ion .",
    "a statistical approach to deal with so many levels is therefore necessary ; solving the full statistical equilibrium equations would indeed require inverting very large matrices which is not only costly but numerically inaccurate .",
    "we therefore group individual levels into superlevels , assuming that the population of each level in a given superlevel follow the boltzmann distribution . while the populations of superlevels could depart from their lte values , all sublevels in a given superlevel share the same @xmath12-factor .",
    "we have applied two criteria to group the levels : all sublevels must have very close excitation energies , and they share the same parity .",
    "the first criterion ensures that collisional rates between sublevels are large enough to achieve the boltzmann statistics ; the second criterion further supports the validity of this assumption by treating properly transitions out of and in to metastable states .",
    "the second requirement provides the additional advantage of avoiding radiative transitions within a single superlevel .",
    "the absorption cross - section of a superline between two superlevels can be quite complex , involving hundreds or thousands of individual lines .",
    "exact absorption cross - sections are computed at three depths ( top and bottom of the model atmosphere , and at a depth where @xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath2 ) , and are logarithmically interpolated between these points .",
    "a detailed representation requires a very large number of frequency points .",
    "opacity sampling is a method designed for handling such cases , and its implementation in tlusty   was outlined in sect .",
    "[ blanksect ] .",
    "non - lte calculations also require collisional excitation and ionization rates .",
    "however , collisional rates are known only for a limited set of transitions , mostly inter - system transitions that are important for diagnostics at low densities .",
    "the iron project @xcite is starting to remedy this situation , but their data are not yet implemented in tlusty .",
    "we rely on general formulae at this stage .",
    "we use the @xcite formula for collisional ionization ; for optically - allowed line transitions , we use the @xcite formula which is accurate to about 30  -  50  % ( pradhan , priv .",
    "comm . ) ; for forbidden transitions , no approximate formula or a simple prescription is available , so we somewhat arbitrarily use eissner - seaton s formula with @xmath15 .",
    "different approaches of collisional strengths in superlines may be implemented .",
    "@xcite compared two different estimates and they argued that the most natural way consists in summing up all contributions for individual transitions , using the appropriate formulae for allowed and for forbidden transitions . we have adopted this approach here .    the following subsections provide the relevant details of the model atoms .",
    "table  [ iontbl ] summarizes the atomic data included in the model atmospheres , as well as the references to the original calculations collected in topbase .",
    "datafiles and grotrian diagrams may be retrieved from tlusty s web site , http://tlusty.gsfc.nasa.gov .",
    "the model atom of hydrogen includes the lowest 8 levels and one superlevel grouping the higher excitation levels , from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , following the occupation probability formalism developed by @xcite and extended to nlte situations by @xcite . the lyman and balmer continuum cross - sections are generalized to account for transitions from these two levels to dissolved higher states .",
    "this contribution is neglected for all other continua .",
    "all lines between the first 8 bound levels are included , assuming an approximate stark profile for the lyman and the balmer series @xcite and a doppler profile for the other lines .",
    "the higher members of the lyman and the balmer line series are incorporated via the os approach .",
    "this is the only difference from the treatment of @xcite who adopted odfs .",
    "os is used here in order to account exactly for line blending with the line series ( and with other lines ) .",
    "higher members of other line series are neglected .",
    "hydrogen is the main opacity source in the photospheres of o stars .",
    "we can benefit most of our hybrid cl / ali method by selecting a few key frequencies where the hydrogen opacity is largest , at which the mean intensity of the radiation field is linearized .",
    "we have selected the first six frequencies immediately higher than the lyman edge , the three core frequencies in ly  @xmath18 , and the core frequency of ly  @xmath8 , ly  @xmath19 , h  @xmath18 , and h  @xmath8 .",
    "a few more frequencies have been selected in the cores of strong resonance lines of other species , and will be mentioned in the relevant subsections .",
    "although there might be a different optimal choice of these frequencies for each individual model atmosphere , we have found that this choice was generally adequate to achieve most of the gains of the cl / ali method in the parameter space covered by the ostar2002   grid .",

    "these emission lines are very sensitive to the exact @xmath12-factor ratios , and small differences related to interpolations may result in larger spectral changes . based on these limited tests , we may however conclude that the two interpolation procedures appear both reasonably safe because of the sufficiently dense sampling of the ostar2002   grid .",

    "we may indeed expect that model spectra change with changes in the temperature structure ( this does not exclude of course that some line profiles might be different even with very close temperature structures , see below ) .",
    "first , differences are larger with odf s than when adopting a rather large sampling step .",
    "we interpret this as reflecting incorrect blends between odfs and important lines of light elements .",
    "the larger sampling step is probably appropriate in many cases ( @xmath99k ) , and reduces the computing time by a factor of about three ( the reduction in the number of frequency points ) .",
    "the largest difference arising due to the line strength selection criterion is seen at depth , because of a large change in the number of selected lines .",
    "however , this does not affect the predicted spectrum .",
    "differences in the layers where the spectrum is formed are small ( @xmath100k ) showing that most of the line - blanketing effect is due to the strongest 10@xmath70 to 10@xmath101 lines rather than to millions of weaker lines .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fetfig ] show the results related to the model atoms .",
    "first , we see that increasing the number of superlevels results in small changes , while the model with less superlevels shows a larger systematic temperature difference . although limited in scope ( one set of stellar parameters ) , this test thus supports a claim that we have adopted fe model atoms of reasonable sizes for our grid of model atmospheres .",
    "finally , the levels above the ionization limits have a minimal effect on the model atmosphere structure .    in a second test",
    ", we have investigated the omission of highly - excited levels of light elements .",
    "[ atomsect ] details the adopted model atoms . in some cases ,",
    "levels with main quantum number , @xmath31 , have been neglected ( e.g. , and ) .",
    "we have built a new model atom which includes all levels below the ionization limit that are considered in op calculations .",
    "the new model atom includes the first 34 levels as individual explicit levels and group higher levels into 12 superlevels .",
    "we have recomputed one model atmosphere , s35000g325v10 , assuming the extended model atom .",
    "the atmospheric structure is changed very little ( @xmath102k ) , and this omission is therefore mostly of no consequence .",
    "however , the total recombination rate , from c@xmath103 to c@xmath104 is significantly increased , by a factor 2 to 3 .",
    "recombination lines in the optical , e.g. @xmath374650 , show thus significantly stronger emission in the new model .",
    "we note here in passing that these  of - type \" lines are predicted in emission by plane - parallel , hydrostatic , nlte model atmospheres at low gravities @xcite .",
    "these are nlte recombination lines and emission is neither a consequence of a stellar wind nor of an extended atmosphere .",
    "we caution therefore against using the current grid for quantitative analysis of weak absorption or emission features in the optical spectrum without a careful investigation case by case .",
    "a future update is expected .",
    "we have constructed a comprehensive grid of metal line - blanketed , nlte , plane - parallel , hydrostatic model atmospheres for the basic parameters appropriate to o - type stars .",
    "the ostar2002   grid considers 12 values of effective temperatures @xmath0k @xmath1@xmath2  @xmath55k , with 2500k steps , 8 surface gravities , @xmath4 with 0.25dex steps , and 10 chemical compositions , from metal - rich relative to the sun to metal - free .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath5 for a given @xmath2   is actually set by an approximate location of the eddington limit .",
    "the selected chemical compositions have been chosen to cover a number of typical environments of massive stars : the galactic center , the magellanic clouds , blue compact dwarf galaxies like izw18 , and galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the paper contains a description of the ostar2002   grid and some illustrative examples and comparisons .",
    "the complete ostar2002   grid is available at our website at http://tlusty.gsfc.nasa.gov .",
    "we are aware that the presented grid can not represent the last word in o star model stellar atmospheres .",
    "however , we intended to provide a more or less definitive grid of model atmospheres in the context of one - dimensional , plane - parallel , homogeneous , hydrostatic models in radiative equilibrium .",
    "we have attempted to take into account essentially all important opacity sources ( lines and continua ) of all astrophysically important ions .",
    "likewise , we have attempted to consider all relevant atomic processes that determine the excitation and ionization balance of all such atoms and ions . in other words , since the computational effort behind constructing the above described 690 models is enormous , we intended to compute as complete and realistic models as possible , in order to avoid a need to recompute a grid in a near future should some neglected mechanism or an opacity source is found to be important .",
    "although we spent all effort to make sure that the treatment of atomic physics and opacities is as complete and accurate as possible , there are still several points we are aware of that were crudely approximated .",
    "those approximations were necessitated not by shortcomings of our modeling scheme or a lack of adequate computer resources , but by the present lack of sufficient atomic data .",
    "these approximations include ( roughly in the order of estimated importance ) :    @xmath105 a crude and approximate treatment of collision rates for forbidden transitions of fe and ni . as discussed in ",
    "[ atomsect ] , since no approximate formula or a simple prescription is available , we have somewhat arbitrarily adopted the eissner - seaton formula with @xmath15 .",
    "the iron project provides , and will keep providing in future , theoretical calculations for selected transitions for various ions of iron ; we plan to implement all the newly available collision rates in future calculations in order to check their influence explicitly .",
    "@xmath105 a neglect of very high energy levels of light metals . the opacity project , which is the basic source of our atomic data , typically considers energy levels only up to a certain principal quantum number ( usually 10 ) .",
    "the higher levels are neglected .",
    "this does not usually cause any significant errors in the excitation balance , but in some cases recombinations to these neglected levels may represent a non - negligible contribution to the total recombination rate  the global ionization balance may thus be somewhat in error .",
    "@xmath105 inaccuracies in , or a lack of , computed photoionization cross - sections .",
    "although the opacity project provided a large number of cross - sections , many are still missing .",
    "we have approximated all cross - sections for which we did not find any published data by hydrogenic cross - sections . however , since we have adopted accurate data for the most important transitions , we do not believe that this may be a source of significant errors .",
    "@xmath105 we did not consider charge exchange reactions . in this case , some necessary atomic data are available , but in view of high temperature of the atmospheres of o - type stars , we do not expect the charge exchange reactions to have any significant contribution to the computed nlte excitation / ionization balance .",
    "@xmath105 plane - parallel atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this is perhaps the most important and restrictive assumption .",
    "because of its importance , we have discussed it at length in  [ staticrelev ] . essentially , we argued that while the wind features can not obviously be described by means of our models , the rest of the uv and optical spectra is well described , unless the wind is truly extreme . in any case",
    ", the ostar2002   grid should not be used for analyzing luminous blue variables or wolf - rayet stars , where already the continuum is formed in the wind ; and the grid should be used with caution in the case of of supergiants .",
    "@xmath105 homogeneity ( i.e. , a 1-d atmosphere ) .",
    "this means that any surface inhomogeneities are neglected .",
    "however , our understanding of inhomogeneities in hot star atmospheres is very poor , and at present there is little what can be done on a quantitative level",
    ".    @xmath105 radiative equilibrium .",
    "our approach neglects any source of mechanical energy dissipation , shocks , non - thermal x - rays , and related phenomena .",
    "again , there is no approach at present that would address those issues from the first principles , and therefore any modeling of such phenomena is necessarily extremely crude .    despite of the long list of approximations and uncertainties",
    ", we believe that the ostar2002   grid represents a definite improvement over previous grids of o star model atmospheres .",
    "we believe that we have constructed a more or less definitive grid of models in the context of one - dimensional , plane - parallel , homogeneous , geometry in a hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium , with all important opacity sources ( metal lines ) included , and without any unnecessary numerical approximations .",
    "we hope that the ostar2002   grid of models will be useful for a number of years to come , until a new - generation models with multi - dimensional , self - consistent radiation magneto - hydrodynamic description will be developed .",
    "we are indebted to sally heap for her continuing encouragement and motivation to compute this grid , and for suggesting a number of various improvements of the modeling strategy .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions and collaboration with many colleagues , most importantly with john hillier , david hummer , dimitri mihalas , klaus werner , stefan dreizler , stefan haas , and the late keith smith . on the computational side",
    ", we would like to thank most sincerely keith feggans for his invaluable assistance , and for his patience to answer our many calls to help whenever any computer - related problem occurred , day or night , during our work on computing model atmospheres at nasa / gsfc .",
    "last but not least , we are greatly indebted to all the physicists who provided , and are still providing , all the necessary atomic data , in particular the op / ip team , bob kurucz , and the nist team . the present sophistication of current model atmospheres would simply not been achievable without all their work during many years .",
