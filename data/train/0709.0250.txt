    "spectral element methods have been mainly applied to the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of fluid flow problems at low and moderate reynolds ( re ) numbers . with the advent of more powerful computers , especially through cluster technology ,",
    "higher re values seem to fall within the realm of feasibility .",
    "however , despite their high accuracy , spectral element methods are still far from reaching industrial applications that involve developed turbulence at re values of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "the reason for that dismal performance is that a resolved dns including all scales from the gross structures to kolmogorov scales , needs a number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) that grows like @xmath2 .",
    "therefore with increasing re , we have to increase the number of elements , @xmath3 , and the degree , @xmath4 , of the polynomial spaces .",
    "this places the computational load far out of the reach of present day computers .",
    "large - eddy simulation ( les ) represents an alternative to dns insofar that it involves less dofs because the behaviour of the small scales are modeled .",
    "the les methodology deals with high re number unsteady flows by using coarse meshes in which the contributions of small sub - grid scale ( sgs ) structures are modeled while the large - scale structures are obtained by the computed flow dynamics .",
    "the reader is referred to the monograph by sagaut @xcite for details . in this paper",
    "we will focus our attention on the dynamic model @xcite which will be evaluated by comparing les numerical results and dns on the three - dimensional cubic cavity flow .",
    "large - scale quantities , designated by an `` overbar '' , are obtained by a filtering process on the domain @xmath5 . assuming the filter commutes with differentiation and applying the filter to the navier ",
    "stokes equations in divergence form for the nonlinear term , one obtains the following relations : + & = & - p + - , [ eq : filterns ] + * v * & = & 0.[eq : les ] here , @xmath6 is the filtered velocity , @xmath7 denotes the time , @xmath8 is the filtered pressure divided by the constant density , @xmath9 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the symbols @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the nabla and laplacian operators , respectively .",
    "the sgs stress tensor @xmath12 takes the small - scale effects into account and is given by = * * -*v * * v*. [ eq : sgs ]      the sgs smagorinsky model ( sm ) @xcite uses the concept of turbulent viscosity and assumes that the small scales are in equilibrium , balancing energy production and dissipation .",
    "this yields the following expression for the eddy - viscosity _",
    "t = ( c_)^2 |s| , [ eq : lesconst ] where @xmath13 is the magnitude filtered strain - rate - tensor , @xmath14 is the smagorinsky constant and @xmath15 the filter width .",
    "the sm has several drawbacks .",
    "the most severe one is the constant value of @xmath14 during the computation which produces too much dissipation .",
    "furthermore the sm does not provide the modeller with backscattering where kinetic energy is transferred from small scales to larger scales .    the dynamic model ( dm ) proposed by germano et al .",
    "@xcite overcomes the difficulty of constant @xmath14 , by allowing it to become dependent of space and time .",
    "now we have a dynamic constant @xmath16 .",
    "let us introduce a test - filter length scale @xmath17 that is larger than the grid length scale @xmath15 ( e.g. @xmath18 ) .",
    "using the information provided by those two filters and assuming that in the inertial range of the turbulence energy spectrum , the statistical self - similarity applies , we can better determine the features of the sgs stress . with the test filter , the former les equations ( [ eq : filterns ] ) yield a relation involving the sub - test - scale stress = * * - * * * * .",

    "this approximation avoids the presence of spurious pressure modes as it was proved by maday and patera @xcite .",
    "the quadrature rules involved in the weak formulation define a gauss  lobatto  legendre ( gll ) grid for the velocity nodes and a gauss  legendre grid ( gl ) for the nodal pressures .",

    "the explicit viscous part @xmath43 leads to a stability condition such that @xmath44 while the cfl condition restricts the time step such that @xmath45 .",
    "it would seem that the viscous restriction is more severe than the convective one .",
    "however the magnitude of the term @xmath43 is far smaller than the one of the convective term .",
    "therefore the stability is indeed enforced by the cfl limit .",
    "the implicit part is solved by a generalized block lu decomposition , using a standard fractional - step method with pressure correction which may be preconditioned by various algorithms .",
    "as spectral elements offer high accuracy for the flow at hand , we construct the filters using two spectral techniques .",
    "the first one is a nodal filter acting in physical space on the nodal velocity components ( and pressure ) to stabilize the computations .",
    "the second method is designed as a modal filter and is carried out element - wise in spectral space and corresponds to the convolution kernel of the les filtering .",
    "the nodal filter is due to mullen and fischer @xcite and is adequately suited to parallel spectral element computation .",

    "the reynolds number is consequently @xmath64 .",
    "we will essentially address the case of the flow at @xmath0 .",
    "the kinetic energy is provided to the flow by the shear stress at the top lid through viscous diffusion .",
    "the amplitude of the reynolds stress below the lid is negligible indicating that the flow under the lid is mainly laminar but transient .",
    "the momentum transfer from the lid induces a region of strong pressure in the upper corner of the downstream wall as the flow , mainly horizontal prior the corner , has to change direction and moves vertically downwards .",

    "the computations are particularly sensitive to the values of @xmath32 and @xmath57 ; smaller values will affect spectral convergence whereas higher values will have very little effect on the smallest scales of the problem .",

    "its maximum value fluctuates around 0.25 with locally some negative values which are eliminated by clipping .",
    "the time step is chosen as @xmath70 and the complete simulation comprises 201000 iterations leading to a total effective simulation time of 201 time units .",
