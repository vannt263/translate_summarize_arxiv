    "improving the stochastic estimator ensures that the acceptance rate of the pgsm update is close to the theoretical maximum , the exact ratio of the determinants .",

    ". that will be the case if the configurations proposed by the pure gauge action @xmath1 are close to the dynamical configurations .",
    "chosing @xmath1 such that it matches the lattice spacing and/or short distance fluctuations of the expected dynamical configurations can maximize the acceptance rate .",
    "such a matching requires the shift of the pure gauge coupling towards the appropriate quenched value .",
    "this shift can be compensated by the @xmath2 term .",
    "@xmath2 is taken into account in the accept - reject step but since it depends on the smeared links only , it fluctuate much less than @xmath1 and does not affect the acceptance rate significantly @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the pgsm algorithm depends on both the partial - global heat bath update and the stochastic estimator .",

    "the autocorrelation time of the pure gauge partial - global heat bath update can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the autocorrelation time of the pure gauge heat bath update , @xmath38 is the volume of the lattice , and @xmath39 is the acceptance rate .",

    "it is actually faster to create hyp smeared configurations with pgsm than thin link ones with a small step size algorithm .",
    "the pgsm algorithm scales with the square of the lattice volume . to repeat",
    "the above measurements on 100  @xmath51 lattices would increase the computer time by 100",
    ". a factor of 10 increase is due to the increased volume , and the other factor of 10 is due to the increased autocorrelation time . even on 100  @xmath52 volume",
    "the pgsm simulation with @xmath53 will be only a few times slower than thin link fermion simulations .",
