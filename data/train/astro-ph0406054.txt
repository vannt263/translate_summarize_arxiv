    "conventionally , the first indirect manifestation of a young massive star is provided by the presence of ` hot cores ' .",
    "hot cores are small , dense , relatively warm , optically thick , and transient objects detected in the vicinity of newly formed massive stars .",
    "it is well - known that they exhibit a range of molecular species unlike those found in quiescent molecular clouds : in comparison , hot cores are richer in small saturated molecules and in large organic species ( e.g. walmsley and schilke 1993 ) .",
    "the characteristic hot core chemistry is believed to arise from the evaporation of the icy mantles that accumulated on dust grains during the collapse that led to the formation of the massive star ; solid - state processing in the ice and gas - phase chemistry after evaporation also occur ( cf .",
    "millar 1993 ; nomura and millar 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , recent observations do indicate the existence of possible precursors of hot cores ( e.g molinari et al .",
    "2002 ; beuther et al .",
    "thus , hot cores and their precursors may be regarded as containing an integrated record of the physics of the collapse process in the chemistry of the ices deposited during that collapse.it is the task of astrochemistry to unravel this record from the observations .",
    "viti & williams ( 1999 ) noted that the duration in which the grains are warmed from very low ( @xmath310 k ) temperatures to the temperature at which h@xmath0o ice desorbs and above is determined by the time taken for a pre - stellar core to evolve towards the main sequence .",
    "this time is believed from observational and theoretical studies to be fairly brief , @xmath310@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 y ( e.g. bernasconi & maeder 1996 , hereafter bm96 ) , and in some contexts this ` turn - on ' of the star may be regarded as instantaneous . however , in the context of hot cores , which have a duration similar to that of the turn - on time of the hot star , the relatively slow warming of the grains must be taken into account .",
    "evidently , highly volatile species will be desorbed from the ices at early stages , while the more refractory species will only be desorbed at later stages .",
    "the chemistry of the hot cores must reflect this temperature - driven evolution , and the evolutionary chemistry should provide , in principle , a direct measure of the stellar turn - on time .",
    "thus , hot cores contain not only a record of the collapse process but also of the ignition history of the star .",
    "the de - convolution of hot core observational data should constrain both physical processes .",
    "the viti & williams study , in the absence of reliable data , made a gross simplification in the description of desorption from mixed ices ; their paper emphasised that appropriate temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiments on mixed ices under near - interstellar conditions were essential .",
    "such definitive measurements have now been made at the university of nottingham surface astrochemistry experiment .",
    "fraser et al . (",
    "2001 ) reported a tpd study of pure h@xmath0o ice , and collings et al .",
    "( 2003a ) examined the tpd of h@xmath0o / co ice mixtures . both experiments provided data that is in striking contrast to the assumptions made in models of hot cores .",
    "in particular , collings et al . showed that co desorbed from an h@xmath0o / co ice mixture occurs in four temperature bands , rather than the assumed co desorption at temperatures above about 25 k. they also found that the proportion of the co desorbing at each phase depended on the total co concentration and on the preparation of the sample .",
    "these laboratory results suggest that in hot cores the co being injected into the gas phase from the ices should occur in four phases , rather than a single pulse .",
    "the chemistry of interstellar ices is of course much more complex than a simple h@xmath0o / co ice mixture , although h@xmath0o is always the dominant partner ( whittet 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , similar tpd experiments on a variety of ices have been carried out at nottingham ( collings et al .",
    "in addition , the properties of some other species with respect to desorption have been considered .",
    "it has been found possible to categorize all species relevant to hot cores as h@xmath0o - like ( i.e. behaving as determined by fraser et al .",
    "2001 ) ; co - like ( as described by collings et al .",
    "2003a ) , or placed in several other intermediate categories .",
    "thus , it is now possible to attempt to model the chemistry near high mass stars in which the desorption of each species in the ice mixture is described as indicated by experimental results obtained under conditions similar to those hot cores .",
    "this paper reports the results of such a study .",
    "we model the chemistry of gas and the deposition of the ices during the collapse , and subsequently the desorption and chemistry in the gas phase after the star begins to warm the core .",
    "our purpose is to demonstrate the consequences of incorporating reliable tpd data into chemical models .",
    "specific sources will be modelled in later papers .    in section 2",
    "we describe the new tpd results .",
    "section 3 gives descriptions of the physical and chemical aspects of the model , and the results are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 gives a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "for simplicity , throughout the paper , we shall use the word ` hot core ' to include any pre - stellar core such as those observed by molinari et al .",
    "( 2002 and references therein ) which are believed to be possible hot core precursors .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb : tc_temps ]",
    "the first task of this theoretical study is to determine whether the inclusion of the five distinct desorption events occurring during tpd of dirty ice affect significantly the abundances predicted by previous models , in particular the vw99 models . to isolate this effect we ran several models using the same initial conditions of vw99 i.e the same initial abundances ( see table 2 from vw99 ) and chemical database .",
    "we found that substantial differences are seen between these models and vw99 .",
    "these differences are solely due to the new evaporation treatment",
    ".    we then constructed a new grid of models using the revised initial elemental abundances listed in section 3 , and the latest database umist99 .",
    "we ran several models covering stars with masses from 5 to 60 m@xmath6 .",
    "we have taken the contraction times from bm96 as the epochs at which the temperature of the core reaches 300k .",
    "the desorption temperatures were calculated by running simulations of water ice desorption ( collings et al .",
    "2003b ) using the power law temperature profiles fitted to the stars of each mass .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show the fractional abundances obtained from our computations for selected species for respectively a m = 25 m@xmath6 , m = 5 m@xmath6 , and m = 15 m@xmath6 star .",
    "the species that are most affected by the inclusion of the new evaporation treatment are sulfur - bearing species and the larger species .",
    "the sensitivity of sulfur - bearing species to physical and chemical variations during the lifetime of a hot cores is not surprising as previous studies have shown that sulfur - bearing species are strongly time - dependent ( e.g. hatchell et al .",
    "1998 ; viti et al .",
    "2001 , hatchell & viti 2002 ) . while larger molecules , such as ch@xmath1oh and ch@xmath0co , maintain the same trends from a 5 to a 25 m@xmath6 star , the behaviour of sulfur - bearing species depend on the heating rate and hence on the mass of the star .",
    "in particular , we find that the evaporation of h@xmath0s at different evolutionary stages is one of the main key factor to the changes occurring in the sulfur bearing chemistry : for a 25 m@xmath6 star the abundance of h@xmath0s itself varies by about one order of magnitude with time ; as the mass of the star decreases this difference becomes larger , up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "h@xmath0s has two main peaks in abundance due to desorption from the volcano and co - desorption events , but each peak is followed by a quick and sharp decline due to dissociation .",
    "this fast and changing behaviour has several consequences on other sulfur bearing species ; it is interesting to look at these changes in the ratios of selected sulfur bearing species e.g : for a 25 m@xmath6 star , ( i ) h@xmath0s / so@xmath0 is @xmath7 1 up to 50,000 years , and @xmath8 1 for older cores .",
    "( ii ) h@xmath0s / cs , h@xmath0s / h@xmath0cs , h@xmath0s / ocs @xmath7 1 up to 150,000 yrs and @xmath8 1 for older cores ; ( iii ) so / cs , so / h@xmath0cs , so / ocs @xmath3 1 up to 65,000 yrs and @xmath8 1 after that . for a 5 m@xmath6 star , we find similar trends but much more accentuated ; for example , h@xmath0s , so and so@xmath0 show similar abundances for longer periods during the earlier phases of star formation , while h@xmath0s / so@xmath0 is much less than 1 after 190,000 yrs .",
    "in general h@xmath0s decreases much more drastically with time as we move toward the lower mass regime ; this is because , although the temperatures at which the evaporations occur are quite similar between the 5 and the 25 m@xmath6 cases , the temperature increases occurs more slowly for a 5 m@xmath6 star , allowing more time for the gas h@xmath0s to be destroyed , before another h@xmath0s evaporation ` peak ' occurs .",
    "the main destruction route for h@xmath0s is its reaction with hco@xmath9 ; the latter becomes abundant once the temperature reaches @xmath3 21 k and the first co evaporation peak occurs . from these trends ,",
    "it is clear that the ratio of these sulfur - bearing species can be used to investigate the evolution of the early phases of high mass star formation , and that sulfur bearing species are therefore good ` chemical clocks ' .",
    "another set of species that can be used as evolutionary indicators are organic molecules .",
    "figure 3 shows the time evolution for selected large species for a 15 m@xmath6 star . from the figure",
    ", we note that large species , such as c@xmath0h@xmath2oh , hcooch@xmath1 and ch@xmath1oh , are good indicators of old cores as these strongly bound species are abundant in the gas only at late times .",
    "although observationally less significant , we would also like to draw attention to other species ( not shown ) namely : co varies by about 1 order of magnitude during the increase of the temperature and therefore during the formation of a high mass star but , co being a ubiquitous species , this difference , even if detectable , may not , by itself , be indicative . finally , we find that n@xmath0h@xmath9 should be present in detectable quantities in young hot cores but disappears probably within the first 15,000 years of its lifetime , when the temperature has reached @xmath3 40k ; this corresponds roughly to the mono evaporation of co ( @xmath3 40 k ) and of ch@xmath10 ( @xmath3 45 k ) .",
    "in fact the main destruction routes for n@xmath0h@xmath9 are its reactions with methane and co. on the contrary ammonia should only be detectable in cores older than 30,000 years ( for a 25 m@xmath6 ) intermediate aged high mass star formation cores should be in general nitrogen - deficient .",
    "we have extended existing chemical models of high mass star formation cores by including the latest experimental results on desorption from grains in the evaporation of icy mantles formed in star - forming regions .",
    "we find that distinct chemical events occur at specific grain temperatures .",
    "this supports our assertion that in a comprehensive model it should be possible to use these chemical events as a chemical clock tracing the ignition of the nearby star .",
    "we have shown that , provided there is a monotonic increase in the temperature of the gas and dust surrounding the protostar , the changes in the chemical evolution of each species due to differential desorption are important .",
    "based on the recent tpd experimental results , the species that are most affected are : h@xmath0s , so , so@xmath0 , ocs , h@xmath0cs , cs , ns , ch@xmath1oh , hcooch@xmath1 , ch@xmath0co , c@xmath0h@xmath2oh , and to a lesser extent co , n@xmath0h@xmath9 , nh@xmath1 and hcn , hnc .",
    "our results imply that if a large enough sample of high mass precursors objects are observed in these molecules , we would gather enough information to determine their age and therefore the evolutionary stage of the high mass star formation core .",
    "finally , we note that 1 ) effects induced by the relatively slow warming of gas near stars are more pronounced near stars of moderate mass , since the turn - on time for stars of intermediate mass is much longer than for massive stars .",
    "observations of cores similar to hot cores are now being found for intermediate - to - low mass stars ( e.g cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ) ; 2 ) the evolutionary trends found in this study depend on the temperature gradient .",
    "hence , at the established ` hot core ' stage , similar trends should be found as a function of distance from the central star , again due to a temperature gradient ( e.g nomura and millar 2004 ) .",
