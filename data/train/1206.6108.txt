    "we present the methodology used to derive structural measurements for the galaxies investigated in the _ zurich environmental study ( zens ) _",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the resulting measurements are provided in the zens global catalog that we have published electronically with paper i.    zens is designed to address the question of which specific environment is most relevant for influencing the properties of different galaxy populations .",
    "several definitions of environment have been commonly employed in the literature to study the relation between environment and galaxy evolution : the density of galaxies calculated out to a fixed or an adaptive distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass of the host group or cluster @xcite , the distance from the group / cluster center @xcite or the location into larger structures such as cosmic filaments or superclusters @xcite .",
    "recently , the ability to separate galaxies into centrals and satellites within their host group halos has produced mounting evidence that the environmental influence on the star - formation properties of galaxies may peak for satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "there is cross - talk however between different definitions of environment , which may also relate to one another from a physical perspective .",
    "a key question is therefore to identify what is the relative importance of different environmental conditions for well - defined galaxy populations of different masses , star formation activity levels , and structural / morphological properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in zens",
    "we aim at helping clarifying which of the many environments that a galaxy experience has a larger impact on its evolution .",
    "we do so by using the same sample of suitably selected nearby galaxies to investigate the dependence of their properties , at fixed stellar mass , on four environment measurements : the host group halo mass , the radial segregation within the group , the large scale density field on which the group halos reside , and the galaxy rank within its group halo , i.e. , whether it is the central or a satellite galaxy within the gravitational potential of its host group . in computing our proxies for these different environments ,",
    "we have attempted to minimize cross - talks between their definitions , in order to better disentangle one from another of the physical conditions that galaxies experience ( see paper i ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the quantification of robust galaxy structural and morphological properties , which provide key information on the life histories of galaxies .",
    "the presence and properties of massive disks and spheroids highlight the occurrence of relatively slow and dissipative gas accretion @xcite or mergers ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "inner cores or cusps @xcite and tidal debris @xcite also trace the degree of dissipation involved in the evolution of galaxies ( not surprisingly with some debate , @xcite ) .",
    "bars and pseudo - bulges are smoking guns for either secular evolution processes ( @xcite ) , or possibly for early bulge formation through instabilities in the proto - disks @xcite .",
    "a robust determination of galaxy morphology is hence essential for understanding whether this is linked to any of the environmental conditions above , how precisely it relates to the occurrence , enhancement or cessation of star formation activity , and thus for pinning down which physical processes drive galaxy evolution .",
    "determining galaxy structure is however notoriously not a trivial task .",
    "visual morphological classification is still a widely adopted method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , despite its subjectivity and failure to provide quantitative measurements for different components , which are necessary to trace galaxy assembly over cosmic time . for these reasons",
    "numerous publications have been devoted to the development of methods and software for the automated quantification of structure on large galaxy samples .",
    "there are a number of approaches to the problem which can be broadly divided into two categories : those which employ parametric descriptors for the galaxy morphology , namely a set of analytical profiles used to model the bulge , disk , or bar component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and those which instead use the observed properties of the light distribution , such as the degree of asymmetry , isolation of bright pixels or decompositions into a set of basis functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two methods have different strengths : parametric decomposition is useful to obtain measurements of characteristic sizes and to have an estimate of the relative importance of the bar , disk and bulge components ; it also easily includes the effects of seeing .",
    "non - parametric estimators well describe the inhomogeneities in the light distributions of real galaxies , which typically display irregular , non axis - symmetric features generated by recent star - formation , dust or galaxy interactions .",
    "both parametric and non - parametric measurements suffer however from a number of observational biases , which must be corrected for in order to perform comparisons between galaxies of different properties , and observed in different conditions .",
    "in particular , in ground - based surveys , the effect of atmospheric seeing is one of the major complications .",
    "several studies have shown the strong impact of the seeing on the photometric and structural properties of galaxies , not only in the inner regions of galaxies , but also out to radii corresponding to several fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another factor which affects the derivation of structural parameters is the inclination angle at which a galaxy is observed .",
    "the overlap , in projection , of multiple subcomponents , as well as physical factors such as the non - uniform distribution of inter - stellar dust  which causes a higher attenuation of short - wavelength light in the central regions of edge - on galaxies than in similar face - on galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  can substantially bias the measurements of sizes , bulge - to - disk ratios , concentration and even stellar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the background sky makes the detection of faint components difficult , a fact which introduces severe biases in the measurements of the galaxy properties , especially magnitudes and sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of the bias depends on galaxy size , inclination and stellar light profile .",
    "although a number of widely - used measurement techniques , such as the computation of kron aperture fluxes @xcite or the extrapolation of model galaxy surface brightness profiles @xcite , can help recover light below the isophotal limit , significant systematic biases remain in the low surface brightness regimes specific to each survey ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in zens we attempt",
    "_ to correct _",
    ", when possible , all measurements of galaxy structure for systematic biases as a function of psf - size , and also galaxy magnitude , size , axis ratio and radial shape of the light profile .",
    "we also quantify the size of systematic biases in regimes of parameter space where the ( statistical ) recovery of the intrinsic information is not achievable , e.g. , at small galaxy sizes and low surface brightnesses .",
    "we also stress that in zens each galaxy is handled individually , till self - consistent and both quantitatively- and visually - checked accurate measurements are achieved .",
    "this enables zens to tackle complementary questions regarding the galaxy - environments relationship relative to larger but less detailed galaxy samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : survey ] we briefly review the specifications and definitions for the four environments under scrutiny in zens .",
    "we then devote the first part of the paper to an overview of the structural measurements carried out on the zens galaxy sample .",
    "these measurements include isophotal analyses and bar detection / quantification ( section [ sec : isophotalanalysis ] ) , analytical surface brightness fits and bulge+disk decompositions ( section [ sec : gim2dmeasurements ] ) , and derivation of non - parametric structural indices ( concentration , gini , asymmetry , m@xmath8 , smoothness ; section [ sec : zest ] ) . in section [ sec : simulations ] we thoroughly investigate the sources of error in these measurements and derive a correction scheme that recovers the intrinsic structural parameters . in section [ sec : morphclass ]",
    "we present the morphological classification of the zens galaxies , based on a quantitative partition of the structural parameter space in regions that are associated with elliptical , bulge - dominated disks , intermediate bulge - to - total ratio disks , late - type disks and irregular galaxies . in the same section",
    "we also discuss the statistics of the structural properties for the various morphological classes .",
    "we describe in detail in appendix [ app : datareduction ] the data reduction and photometric calibration of the eso @xmath9 and @xmath10 wfi/2.2 m imaging data for the zens groups that are introduced in paper i. appendices [ sec : testgim2d]-[app : corrections_psf ] present additional details on the tests performed on the analytical surface - brightness fits and supplementary information for the derivation of the corrections for the structural parameters .",
    "stamp images for galaxies in the different morphological classes are found in appendix [ app : classdist ] . in the final part of the paper we use the corrected structural measurements to study , at constant stellar mass , the concentration of satellite galaxies as a function of hubble type and environment ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we summarize the paper in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "this second zens publication is complemented by a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper iii ) , in which we present the spectrophotometric properties of our galaxy sample and to which we refer for details on the derivation of , e.g. , the galaxy spectrophotometric types , star formation rates and stellar masses that we use in this and other zens papers .    the following cosmological parameters are adopted in all the zens publications : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . unless otherwise specified , magnitudes are in the ab system , and galaxy sizes are _ semi - major _ axis measurements .",
    "all derived luminosities are corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite .",
    "zens is based on a sample of 1484 galaxies , members of 141 galaxy groups extracted from the 2-degrees field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) ( @xcite ) , and specifically from the percolation - inferred galaxy group ( 2pigg ) catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 141 zens groups are a random selection of the 2pigg groups which are found in the very thin redshift slice 0.05@xmath140.0585 and have at least 5 confirmed members , down to a magnitude @xmath15 .",
    "new @xmath16 and @xmath17band images were acquired for these groups with the wfi camera mounted at the cassegrain focus of the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope at la silla , over several observing runs between 2005 and 2009 ( see paper i for details ) . the data reduction and photometric calibration of these wfi data is reported in appendix [ app : datareduction ] .",
    "this paper describes in detail the structural analysis that we have performed on these wfi @xmath9 and @xmath10 images .      for each zens galaxy ,",
    "paper i discusses and publishes four estimates of environment : the group halo mass , the distance from the center of the group , the rank within the group ( i.e. , whether the galaxy is the central or a satellite ) and the location on the large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "in particular :    @xmath18 group masses @xmath1 are derived from the total group luminosities by assuming a mass - to - light ratio calibrated with mock catalogs ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath19 the ranking of galaxies in centrals and satellites factors in the errors on the galaxy stellar masses , and includes a test of self - consistency requiring that a bona - fide central galaxy must , simultaneously , be consistent with being the most massive galaxy of the group , be located within a projected distance @xmath20 from the mass weighted center of the group ( with @xmath21 the characteristic size of the group , as defined in paper i ) , and have a relative velocity within one standard deviation from the group velocity .",
    "@xmath22 the centers of the groups , on which the projected radial positions of satellite galaxies within the groups rely , are identified with the locations of the central galaxies .",
    "we operationally divide the zens group sample into _ relaxed _ and _ unrelaxed _ groups , depending on whether a bona - fide central galaxy can be found , according to the prescription above . in paper",
    "i we discuss the observational biases which may hamper the identification of the central galaxy in groups which are in fact dynamically relaxed .",
    "we therefore use our group classification scheme mostly to test that our results are not affected by the inclusion / exclusion of the unrelaxed groups from our studies , although we keep an eye on the possibility that there may be a physical origin , related to the dynamical evolution of the host groups , for differences observed in otherwise similar galaxies that inhabit the two classes of groups .",
    "@xmath23 the lss density at the zens group locations is defined using an nth nearest - neighbor analysis which adopts the groups ( not the galaxies ) as the tracers of the lss density . specifically , we define @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the density of 2dfgrs groups in a projected circular area defined by the comoving distance of the 5th nearest - neighboring group around the zens group , and @xmath26 is the mean projected density calculated over the global 2dfgrs area at the given redshift .",
    "our choice results in identical @xmath3 values for all galaxy members of any given group , and avoids the problems that are associated with using nth - nearest neighboring galaxy algorithms ( see paper i , and also @xcite ) .      in paper iii we discuss the mass completeness limits of zens which is determined by the 2dfgrs apparent magnitude selection .",
    "the strongest constraints are set by passively evolving galaxies , which have the larger mass - to - light ratio , for which the 85@xmath27 completeness is reached above @xmath28 .",
    "this is the mass completeness threshold that we adopt for passive elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "progressively more actively star forming galaxies have progressively lower mass completeness thresholds , with strongly star forming galaxies mass complete at @xmath29 ( see paper iii ) . given the statistical mix of spectrophotometric types in the different morphological bins , the mass completeness thresholds of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are statistically adequate respectively for the morphological classes of bulge - dominated spirals , intermediate bulge - to - total disk galaxies , and late - type disk ( or irregular ) galaxies .",
    "from top to bottom , the panels show the radial profiles of @xmath17band surface brightness , ellipticity , position angle and the high order fourier coefficient @xmath33 for three example of zens disk galaxies classified as non - barred ( left ) and barred ( right ) . different symbols and gray shades are used to distinguish the profiles for the three individual galaxies.,width=340 ]",
    "surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters were obtained with the iraf routine .",
    "this well - tested algorithm fits the intensity at a given radius with the fourier series @xmath34 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath35 is the mean intensity within the isophote , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 the high harmonic coefficients which quantify isophotal deviations from perfect ellipticity .",
    "we truncated the series after the fourth order , so that , for each isophote , the fits return the mean intensity , position angle ( pa ) , ellipticity ( @xmath38 ) , and the amplitude of the fourth - order coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath33 has been extensively used in the past to measure ` boxiness ' ( @xmath40 ) and ` diskyness ' ( @xmath41 ) of the isophotes ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in running , we allowed the position angle and ellipticity to vary freely with radius , and limited wanderings of the isophotal center to within 3 pixels from the center of the innermost isophotes .",
    "the pa and ellipticity determined by the sextractor algorithm ( @xcite ) served as initial guesses for the algorithm .",
    "the semi - major axis of adjacent isophotes was increased in logarithmic radial steps of 0.1 , in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio when measuring the external isophotes .",
    "we allowed the code to perform a two iteration 3-sigma clipping of the discrepant pixels during the fits , and terminated the fitting procedure when @xmath42 of the pixels in a given step of the calculation were flagged as discrepant .",
    "the procedure was applied independently to the @xmath10 and @xmath9 images , and returned independent surface brightness profiles in each of the two passbands .",
    "we also derived surface brightness profiles in the @xmath9 filter using the isophotal parameters derived from the @xmath10 images ; this returned more reliable surface brightness profiles also at the shorter wavelength for those galaxies whose @xmath9 light distributions were too irregular ( because of dust absorption and star formation knots ) for a reliable measurement directly on the @xmath9 images .",
    "changes in the radial profiles of pa and ellipticity were used as a first diagnostics to identify bars in the ( disk ) galaxies .",
    "the presence of a bar produces a characteristic signature on the isophotes shapes : within the bar region the ellipticity increases smoothly to a maximum value with almost constant pa , and then drops abruptly at the end of the bar , where also the pa changes substantially .",
    "we inspected the @xmath10-band ellipticity and position angle radial profiles of the disk galaxies in our sample ( s0 and later , see section [ sec : morphclass ] for the definition of the morphological types ) .",
    "we classified a disk galaxy as barred if its ellipticity grows to an absolute maximum greater than 0.2 , and shows a variation in ellipticity and pa greater than 0.1 and 10@xmath43 , respectively .",
    "in the bar region , we furthermore request that the pa profile is flat within @xmath44 .",
    "the size of the bar , @xmath45 , was defined to be the semi - major axis associated with the maximum value of the ellipticity profile , subject to the condition that it had to be at least twice the fwhm of the psf , which is typically @xmath46 .",
    "note that galaxies with bar sizes smaller than this threshold are not considered as barred systems .",
    "therefore , our final sample of barred disks provides a conservative lower limit to the total number of such galaxies in the entire sample .",
    "illustrative examples of the isophotal parameters profiles for a random selection of zens galaxies classified as barred and non - barred are shown in figure [ fig : sb_profiles ] .",
    "the above mentioned criteria are widely used in the search for bars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) and are shown to provide robust results , but they can fail in identifying a bar if , e.g. , the bar has a similar pa to that of the disk ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . for this reason , we also visually inspected all the disk galaxies and those which clearly showed a bar structure  and had an ellipticity profile consistent with it , but no drop in pa  were included in the barred sample as well . combining the fitting method with the visual validation we identified a clear bar signature in 148 disk galaxies .    to quantify the bar strength we used the definition of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath47 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the intrinsic axial ratio of the bar .",
    "the bar strength ranges from zero to unity for unbarred galaxies and infinitely strong bars , respectively .",

    "we computed @xmath53 at the bar semi - major axis @xmath45 and we used the values of ellipticity and pa obtained from sextractor @xcite to calculate @xmath55 and @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig : barred_hist ] shows the distribution of bar strength and bar sizes measured in the zens samples of bulge - dominated galaxies ( including both s0 and bulge - dominated spirals ) , intermediate - type and late - type disk galaxies .",
    "the median bar strength mildly increases with hubble type , changing from a value of @xmath56 for s0 or bulge - dominated spirals , to @xmath57 for intermediate - type disks and @xmath58 for late - type disk galaxies .",
    "we also find a decrease in median bar size from late - type to early - type disks : @xmath59 kpc for s0 and bulge - dominated spirals , @xmath60 kpc for intermediate - type disks and @xmath61 for late - type disks .",
    "for both the bar size and strength a kolmogorov - smirnov test rejects a common parent distribution , between bulge - dominated galaxies and late - type disks , with a probability of 99% .",
    "the correlation between bar properties and hubble types ( which could be a reflection of a correlation with galaxy stellar mass , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) has been investigated in several works in the literature , whose results are consistent with our measurements .",
    "for example , a weakening of bars in early type galaxies is reported by @xcite , and an increase in bar size in early- relative to late - type disks is found by @xcite .",
    "two dimensional fits to the surface - brightness distributions of all zens galaxy images were carried out with the galaxy image 2d ( gim2d ) software package ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we used a single srsic profile to describe the total galaxy light distribution , i.e. : @xmath62\\ } $ ] where @xmath63 is the surface intensity at the half - light radius @xmath64 .",

    "* ) .    for the zens galaxies which are not classified as ellipticals ( in section [ sec : morphclass ] )",
    ", we also performed two - components , bulge+disk decompositions of the two - dimensional galaxy light distributions .",
    "for this purpose we assumed a srsic profile for the bulge and a perfectly exponential disk represented by @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the central surface intensity and @xmath69 the disk scale length .",
    "pure exponential models , with no bulge component , were furthermore generated for galaxies classified as late - type disks ( see again section [ sec : morphclass ] ) .",

    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17band images were fitted independently without imposing the structural parameters of one filter to the other band .",
    "the position angles and ellipticity derived from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 band images agree well , with differences being limited to 15@xmath43 and 0.15 , respectively . in only @xmath85 of the galaxies we find differences which are larger than this , with a maximum change in ellipticity @xmath860.2 and a maximum change in position angle @xmath8630@xmath43 . generally speaking ,",
    "we thus conclude that the single component fits are robust and strong twists between the @xmath16 and @xmath17band isophotes are not a problematic issue when performing independent fits for the two passbands .",
    "to verify the validity of the gim2d single - component fits , we ran on all the gim2d models the task , keeping the isophotes fixed at the radii , position angle and ellipticity of the fits to the real galaxy images described in section [ sec : isophotalanalysis ] .",

    "for which the information is publicly available from the nyu - vagc @xcite , a comparison of our estimates of the srsic parameters with those published in this other catalogue ; the comparison shows a good agreement between our _ uncorrected _ measurements and the previously published data . we show below however that , in some regimes of parameter space , these measurements require further corrections to be cleaned by residual observational biases , indicating that also measurements in the quoted and other public catalogues necessitate of similar attention .",
    "the comparison between the structural parameters obtained from the single srsic fits with variable-@xmath80 in the two available passbands is shown in the left and central plots of figure [ fig : gim2d_comp1 ] .",

    "half - light radii measured in the two pass - bands are in very good agreement with each other .",

    "this is not unexpected in an ` inside - out ' galaxy formation process , as younger stellar populations at large radii would lead to this effect .",
    "another difference is observed between @xmath17 and @xmath16band disk scalelengths of large late - type galaxies , as derived from the pure exponential fits ( right - hand side plot in  figure [ fig : gim2d_comp1 ] ) : disk scalelengths @xmath69 derived from @xmath84 fits to relatively large late - type disk galaxies are smaller at the longer wavelength by @xmath91 .",
    "we have checked that the @xmath10 magnitude distribution of these late - type disks is not biased toward faint values that would raise concerns on surface brightness detections . as we show in detail in section [ sec : correctionmaps ] , the @xmath17band gim2d sizes that we derive for relatively large , @xmath92 galaxies are not severely affected by observational biases .",
    "we thus interpret this result again as mostly due to a genuine color gradient in large late - type disks .",

    "summarizing , the larger @xmath69 values from @xmath84 fits and smaller srsic indices from variable-@xmath80 fits of late - type disks in the @xmath9-band relative to the @xmath17band are consistent with being the joint result of the segregation of young stars in the galaxy outskirts and , also , of light absorption from the center of the galaxies by interstellar dust , as discussed in a number of observational and theoretical works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the more pronounced variation of disk scalelength in the pure exponential fits with respect to the half - light radius in the srsic fits for the late - type galaxies can be readily understood : whereas in the variable-@xmath80 single srsic fits a lower central concentration of light can be modeled with a smaller value of the srsic index @xmath80 and a relatively small change in the effective radius , fixing the index to @xmath84 in the pure exponential fits forces an increase of the characteristic scalelength in order to obtain a milder radial decline in surface brightness in the @xmath9 band .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the largest variation in @xmath80 values between the @xmath9- and @xmath10-band variable-@xmath80 srsic fits to late - type disks are observed for those galaxies which also have the largest variations in scalelength @xmath69 when fitted with an @xmath84 profile .",
    "finally we note that a self - consistent correction for dust effects would require radiative transfer simulations of the light scattered and re - emitted by the dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "moreover it remains difficult to disentangle dust effects from genuine radial segregation in the stellar populations .",
    "for these reasons , instead of attempting a correction for dust absorption , we choose the empirical approach of employing the less dust - sensitive @xmath10-band data as the fiducial reference for our structural measurements , and to discuss separately possible dust - reddening effects , when relevant , e.g. , in studying color profiles and star formation rates ( see paper iii ) .",
    "double component , bulge+disk decompositions were also performed on both the @xmath9- and @xmath10-band images of all galaxies which are not classified as ellipticals or irregulars ( section [ sec : morphclass ] ) . for the @xmath10-band ,",
    "our reference filter for structural measurements , no a priori constraints on the bulge and disk parameters were imposed during the fitting procedure , except for the wide limits listed in table [ tab : gim2d_parameters ] . in the @xmath9 filter ,",
    "each galaxy was instead fitted in four different ways : @xmath93 by performing a separate decomposition to the @xmath9-band letting the structural parameters completely unconstrained ( unconstrained model fit , hereafter @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 by fixing the disk and bulge position angles , ellipticity and inclination to those of the @xmath10-band ( constrained model fit number one , hereafter @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 by also fixing the bulge half - light radius and srsic index @xmath80 ( constrained model @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 by keeping all the parameters tied to those of @xmath10-band except for the @xmath100 and total flux ( constrained model @xmath101 ) . in all the models we allowed a maximum wandering of 2 pixels for the disk and bulge components from the sextractor center .",
    "there are clear advantages and disadvantages in performing either independent or constrained fits to the two bands : by fixing the @xmath9-band structural parameters to the @xmath10-band , one ensures that bulge and disk colors are measured consistently over the same regions ; this however prevents the detection of structural differences and color gradients . for this reason we decided to adopt a mixed approach to determine the bulge and disk parameters to the @xmath9-band .",
    "first , not all models returned by the gim2d fits are physically - meaningful bulge+disk decompositions .",
    "we hence adopted a filtering scheme to reject unreliable or unphysical models to all gim2d models , i.e. , the fiducial @xmath17band models for each galaxy , and the four versions of the @xmath16band models .",
    "our filtering scheme is described in appendix [ sec : testgim2d ] .",
    "we then followed a quantitative procedure to select , amongst the physically - valid alternatives for the @xmath9 bulge+disk fits for each galaxy , our fiducial ( i.e. , in our judgement , the most reliable ) bulge+disk @xmath16band decomposition . in brief",
    ", we required that all @xmath16band disk and bulge fits always have bulge and disk position angles , disk inclinations and bulge axis ratios consistent , within a sensible range and @xmath10 bulge and disk position angles , disk inclination angles and bulge ellipticities were respectively @xmath102 , @xmath102 and 0.15 .",
    "] , to those of the @xmath17band fits .",
    "when this was achieved with unconstrained fits to the @xmath9 band images , these unconstrained fits were retained as a fair description of the @xmath9 bulge+disk decompositions .",
    "this choice maximizes the detection of possible wavelength - dependent structural differences and color gradients . for galaxies in which such a consistency requirement was not achieved with the unconstrained @xmath9 fits , we adopted as fiducial @xmath16band fits those which satisfied such requirement with the minimum number of @xmath9 parameters tied to the @xmath10-band fit parameters ( i.e. , in order of priority",
    ", the @xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath101 fits ) .    in cases where both the @xmath96 and @xmath94 models were in principle both potentially good representations of the bulge+disk properties of considered galaxy",
    ", we applied the following decision scheme : if the two models gave disk and bulge size , @xmath100 and srsic indices within @xmath103 of the dispersion measured around the identity from all the model falling in this latter category , then both models were validated as reliable , and we adopted as our fiducial bulge+disk parameter estimates the mean of the structural parameters returned by these two fits . if these two fits returned discrepant values , both were inspected and a judgement was made on which model to use , on the basis of the residual images and the difference in total magnitude between the galaxy and the model .",
    "only @xmath104 of the bulge+disk @xmath9 fits needed this further visual validation .",
    "this entire procedure is schematized in figure [ fig : btchart ] .",
    "it is important to notice that , while disk scalelength and bulge - to - total ratios are quite consistently returned by all four fits to the @xmath9 images , bulge sizes and srsic indices show much larger variations from one fit to the other .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : gim2d_bruns ] , where we compare the different measurements obtained for the @xmath9-band in the four cases @xmath94 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 , @xmath101 .",
    "the robust dispersion around the identity line in the four fits is @xmath105 kpc and 8@xmath27 for @xmath69 and @xmath100 , and @xmath860.6 kpc and 1.6 for the bulge half - light radii and srsic indices @xmath80 , respectively . especially for the bulge @xmath80 values",
    ", models with the isophote s position constrained and unconstrained can indeed provide very different results .",
    "similar conclusions on the reliability of the bulge and disk parameters are drawn from tests on simulated galaxies which we discuss in section [ sec : bulgediskbias ] .        not surprisingly , the success rate for the bulge+disk decomposition is lower than the one for the single component .",
    "the single component fits return robust measurements for @xmath106 of s0 , bulge - dominated spirals and intermediate - type disk galaxies in the both the @xmath9- and @xmath10-bands ( see appendix [ sec : testgim2d ] for a detailed summary for the individual morphological classes ) .",
    "bulge+disk decompositions in both @xmath9- and @xmath10-bands are available for @xmath107 of these galaxies .    for galaxies with a reliable decompositions in both bands ,",
    "figure [ fig : gim2d_comp2 ] presents the parameters obtained in the two pass - bands . partly by construction ,",
    "the scatter around the identity line for the bulge - to - total ratio is less than @xmath108 in the vast majority of the cases , as shown on the top left panel of the figure . given that our morphological classification is based on the @xmath17band bulge - to - total ratios , this means that our classification would not change substantially if we had used the @xmath9-band measurements instead .",
    "the disk sizes obtained in the two filters agree well with each other , although disks are more extended in the @xmath9-band than in the @xmath10-band , as also discussed above .",
    "as anticipated , the bulge radii and indices have instead a broader scatter .",
    "note that , despite the scatter , in the vast majority of cases the srsic indices for the bulge are consistent with either a ` concentrated ' or a ` diffuse ' central bulge component in both filters ; truly discrepant results are obtained in a small number of cases ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "finally , in appendix [ sec : testgim2d ] we show the comparison of our bulge+disk gim2d fits with similar obtained with the package galfit @xcite , and also with bulge+disk+bar fits ; the latter provide an estimate for the impact of a bar component on the bulge ( and disk ) parameters for disks which host such a third component .      as discussed extensively in section [ sec : correctionmaps ] , the calculation of a galaxy size radius is made difficult by a number of observational biases which can lead to substantial uncertainties . here",
    "we additionally show how the estimation of the galaxy half light radius depends on the choice of the specific model to the galaxy light , by comparing the global galaxies half - light radii derived from the single srsic fits with those obtained from the bulge+disk decomposition .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : re_sersicbd ] for the @xmath10-band , but similar results are obtained in the @xmath9-band .",
    "it is clearly seen that for about @xmath110 of the galaxies with formally ` reliable ' bulge+disk decomposition and single component fits , half - light radii from the single srsic models are larger by more than a factor 1.5 than the sizes inferred from the bulge+disk decompositions .",
    "as illustrated in the inset in figure [ fig : re_sersicbd ] , the majority of the discrepant galaxies have steep light profiles with sersic index @xmath111 .",
    "we note that for all these galaxies both the single and double component fits were inspected to confirm their formal reliability ; furthermore , the magnitude difference between the model galaxy and the real zens image within an aperture equal to 1.5 times the petrosian radius is @xmath112 mag for both the single and double component fits .    for these galaxies we decided to keep both radii estimates in our zens catalogue ( published with paper i ) but , to keep memory of the discrepancy , to add to the formal errors an uncertainty equal to half the difference between the two radii estimates .",
    "as an indication that these difference in the measured radii are not peculiar to the zens sample only or to the gim2d software , we remark that other recent publications have found evidence of an overestimation of the half - light radius when a single srsic fit is performed on a galaxies which have intrinsically a bulge and a disk component , for simulations reproducing sdss noise properties and also using different fitting algorithms @xcite .",
    "we further used the _ zurich estimator of structural types plus _ ( zest+ ) , an upgrade of the zest approach published in @xcite , to derive non - parametric measurements of structure for the zens galaxies .",
    "such estimates add further information on the structural properties of the galaxies , are useful in cases where no parametric fit could be performed , and enable comparisons with other published samples .",
    "zest+ is a -based code for the study of galaxy structure and it is designed for automated morphological classification of galaxies through either a principal component analysis or a support vector machines technique ; it features several improvements relative to the zest algorithm and implementation of scarlata et al .",
    "( 2007 ; see for example @xcite for a first application to the cosmos field ; @xcite ) .",
    "the classification scheme uses both user supplied parameters and/or a set of non - parametric morphological coefficients computed by zest+ itself . for the zens galaxies we employed zest+ only to derive the structural coefficients , rather than using the morphological classification option , since , given the limited size of our sample , we were able to perform visual and quantitative checks on the reliability of the classification for each galaxy individually , which we mainly based on the available bulge - to - disk ratios ( see section [ sec : morphclass ] ) .",
    "the measurements provided by zest+ are galaxy concentration @xmath113 , asymmetry ( @xmath114 ) , gini and m@xmath8 coefficients , and smoothness ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "these parameters are widely used in the literature to study galaxy structure and morphology ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for sake of brevity in the following",
    "we will refer to the @xmath4 , @xmath114 , gini , m@xmath8 and @xmath115 set of measurements as to the  @xmath116 \" parameters .",
    "the concentration @xmath117 was defined as the ratio of elliptical radii containing @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the total flux of the galaxy , which is provided as input by the user . for zens , the sextractor kron flux ( )",
    "was employed .    the asymmetry index @xmath114 gives information on the degree of rotational symmetry of the galaxy light .",
    "this is parametrized through the difference between the original galaxy image and a 180@xmath43-rotated version of it . to account for the effect of background noise",
    ", zest+ uses the procedure introduced by @xcite , which involves the calculation of the asymmetry for both the original image @xmath120 and for a smoothed version of it , @xmath121 , where @xmath10 is the intensity of the image on the pixel @xmath122 and @xmath123 the intensity of the rotated image .",
    "the final asymmetry value is given by @xmath124 , where the last term corresponds to the background correction factor .",
    "the gini coefficient @xmath125 introduced by @xcite contains information on how uniformly the light is distributed within the galaxy : if the flux is equally distributed among all pixels , then @xmath125 is equal to zero , whereas if all the light is concentrated in just one pixel , the coefficient @xmath125 is equal to unity .",
    "we defined it as in @xcite : @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the mean of the flux of the galaxy pixels , sorted in increasing order .",
    "the parameter @xmath128 is the normalized second - order moment of the brightest @xmath119 of the galaxy pixels .",
    "it describes the spatial distribution of bright substructures within the galaxy , such as spiral arms , bars or bright nuclei .",
    "the computation of @xmath128 involves the following steps : @xmath93 galaxy pixels are ordered by flux , @xmath95 for the @xmath119 brightest pixels , the sum of moments @xmath129 $ ] with respect to the light - center in the petrosian ellipse @xmath130 , @xmath131 is computed , and @xmath97 the latter is normalized by the total sum of moments to give @xmath132 , with @xmath133 .    finally , the smoothness @xmath115 is a measure of the degree of clumpiness of the galaxy light distribution , and is thus useful to trace patches in the light profile such as star - forming regions . to calculate",
    "@xmath115 , a smoothed version of the original image , obtained by convolving it with a gaussian filter of fwhm equal to 0.25 times the petrosian radius @xmath134 , was subtracted from the image itself .",
    "clumpy regions were then identified from the residual image as those pixels for which the intensity @xmath135 is @xmath136 times higher than the background standard deviation in the residual image @xmath137 .",
    "we used a default threshold factor of @xmath138 .",
    "the pixels so identified were then used to calculate @xmath139 a region of radius @xmath140 from the center was masked out during the calculation to avoid including the highly concentrated centers of the galaxies which will boost the final value of the smoothness .",
    "the gini , m20 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 indices were all calculated within one petrosian ellipse .    along with the structural indices",
    ", zest+ also gives an estimate for the  elliptical aperture \" galaxy half - light radius , based on the user - provided total flux .",
    "these are the measurements we refer to when discussing zest+ half - light radii for our zens galaxy sample .",
    "the careful inspection and filtering of the measurements thus far presented , although necessary , does not provide a quantification of systematic errors in the derived structural parameters . in zens , and more generally in ground - based imaging galaxy surveys , the major contributors to such errors can be identified in the noise of the night sky , and in the psf width . in zens ,",
    "the median @xmath10-band psf fwhm is @xmath141 , which is about 30% of the median half - light radius of the galaxy sample .",
    "both analytical surface brightness fits and non parametric algorithms are affected by these observational limitation and none is completely free from pitfalls : the zest+ measurements are not psf - deconvolved and , to obtain a consistent measure of structure on the different zens fields , an homogenization to a common resolution of the @xmath116 parameters is necessary .",
    "in contrast , gim2d uses the provided psf to derive , in principle , seeing - corrected quantities , and indeed biases related to psf - blurring are less severe in gim2d - based measurements ; however , systematic uncertainties remain , especially in low surface brightness regimes , where both aperture photometry and two - dimensional fits are well known to underestimate galaxy sizes and fluxes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we asses here the impact of these effects specifically for our zens measurements through tests on artificial galaxy images . in particular , we derive recipes to correct the observed galaxy structural parameters ( e.g. , sizes , concentrations , ellipticities , etc . ) for biases in the observations . in areas of parameter space where we can not recover the true values of the given parameters , we provide an estimate for the systematic uncertainty that affects the measurements .",
    "we perform this analysis on the @xmath10-band , which provides a view of the intrinsic galaxy structure less affected by dust or young stars thus is used as our fiducial band to classify galaxies structurally and morphologically .",
    "the corrections in the @xmath9-band are then derived from those obtained for the @xmath10 measurements , suitably rescaled to the @xmath9-band luminosity and psf .",
    "the derivation of the corrections is done by applying the entire process of object extraction , followed by parametric and non - parametric photometric / structural measurements with sextractor / zest+ and gim2d , in exactly the same way as on the real data , to a set of artificial galaxy images for which the intrinsic structural / photometric properties are know precisely by construction .",
    "the difference between the model input and output parameters provides an estimate of the uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "a self - consistent study of the errors in the quantification of the galaxy structural properties must be a function of five parameters : the galaxy luminosity ( magnitude , @xmath142 ) , the galaxy size ( half - light radius @xmath64 ) , the inclination ( ellipticity @xmath38 ) , the steepness of the light profile ( srsic index @xmath80 or concentration @xmath4 ) and the psf under which the galaxy was observed .",
    "the effects of each of such parameters on the quantification of structure , including galaxy sizes , are tightly interconnected and hence need to be considered simultaneously . it is immediately clear that , as an example , the impact of the psf is stronger  with all other parameters fixed  for highly concentrated galaxies than for those with shallow light profiles , and for galaxies with sizes comparable to the seeing than for more extended ones .",
    "we thus adopt a sampling approach in which we construct many thousand artificial galaxy models to fully explore the observed parameter space of galaxies in the zens data set , and such to have , for each combination of the five parameters @xmath143(or @xmath144 , a sufficient number of models on which to test the measurements .",
    "this approach is also used in @xcite on a higher redshift sample of galaxies extracted from the cosmos survey .",
    "two cautionary remarks need to be made : first , our artificial galaxies are generated to populate _",
    "uniformly _ a broad grid in the five - dimensional @xmath143(or @xmath144 space .",
    "real galaxies are not uniformly distributed in this parameter space , and this is not taken into account in our corrections .",
    "second , we deliberately ignore dust or stellar population segregation effects , as our models are created smooth and neglect dust attenuation . in the following",
    "we will test the robustness of our corrections towards the specific design of the simulations .      to derive our correction functions for the structural parameters of zens galaxies we created both srsic models and bulge+disk artificial galaxies on which we tested the corresponding gim2d fits . in both cases ,",
    "models were constructed on a grid of points in the ellipticity , magnitude , size and srsic index ( or b / t ratio ) parameter space .",
    "specifically , in the single component case galaxies were simulated around the following regions : @xmath145 $ ] kpc , @xmath146 $ ] , @xmath147 $ ] and @xmath148 $ ] . for each grid",
    "node 30 models were generated randomly to have : radii and srsic indices within @xmath149 30@xmath27 of the nominal radius and index @xmath80 at the grid point , magnitude within @xmath149 0.25 magnitudes and a difference in ellipticity equal to @xmath149 0.05 .",
    "this makes a total of @xmath150 single - component model galaxies .    for the double component model galaxies , which span a wider range of combination of bulge and disk parameters and are also computationally more expensive",

    "the bulge half - light radius was selected on the same grid used for the disk scale length , but imposing that @xmath157 . the bulge srsic index was allowed to have values @xmath158 with a scatter of @xmath159 and three bins of disk ellipticity ( i.e galaxy inclination ) @xmath160 were employed .",
    "we furthermore assumed that bulges can not be very elongated and hence explored only two values of the ellipticity for the bulge component , namely @xmath161 and @xmath162 , so to bracket any other value in between .",
    "all model galaxies described above were then convolved with three psf sizes , for a total of 180000 single component models and @xmath163 double - component models .",
    "the three psf sizes were taken to reproduce the best , medium and worst zens seeing in the @xmath17band ( respectively 0.7@xmath164 , 1@xmath164 , and 1.5@xmath164 ) .",
    "the psf - convolved models were inserted with poisson sampling into sky - subtracted empty regions extracted from the real zens fields . to mimic noise in the reconstruction of the psf in the real data ,",
    "when performing the gim2d fits on the simulated galaxies we provided as input to the code a rotated version of the psf originally used to convolve the artificial image .    for brevity , we focus in the following on the results obtained for the simulations convolved with the median zens psf , which are hence representative of the bulk of the zens observations . in appendix",
    "[ app : corrections_psf ] a full account of the results derived with the best and worst psf can be found ( see figures [ fig : gim2dcorrections_best ] , [ fig : gim2dcorrections_worst ] , [ fig : zestcorrections_best ] and [ fig : zestcorrections_worst ] ) , which shows correction matrices that are consistent with those here presented .",
    "note that the corrections to each zens galaxy were obtained through linear interpolation , at the psf size value relevant for any given galaxy , of the correction matrices describing psf sizes that bracketed the psf in question .",
    "we start the description of the resulting correction functions by focusing on those parameters which our approach can self - consistently correct without recurring to additional information , namely galaxy sizes and magnitudes .",
    "we show in section [ sec : corrdegeneracy ] how for other structural properties , such as the concentration coefficient , the recovery of the  true \" values is instead less straightforward , and depends on the intrinsic distribution of parameters in the simulated sample ( and requires therefore a different approach ) .",
    "our fiducial measurements of galaxy sizes in zens are those that we derive from the gim2d analytic fits , which are less prone to systematic biases then those inferred with zest+ , as we show below .",

    "calibration maps \" for sizes and magnitudes as shown in figures [ fig : gim2dcorrections ] and [ fig : zestcorrections ] ( see also carollo et al .  2013b for further details on this calibration approach ) .",
    "the arrows in the maps show , at any point of the _ observed _",
    "@xmath166 plane , the direction and strength of the correction which is needed to recover the  intrinsic \" galaxy size and magnitudes from the observed values ; these correction arrows are obtained by taking the median difference between the model nominal input parameters and the parameters measured with zest+/gim2d of all artificial galaxies in the given point in the grid .",
    "the correction matrices are binned in three separate panels of concentration / srsic index and three separate panels of ellipticity .",
    "the colors of the arrows gives the amount of scatter shown by the individual models around the median correction : in green are grid points where all corrections are coherent in strength , in red are shown those which have a high scatter and hence our correction is representative on average but not for the single models .",
    "we use these maps to derive corrections for observed magnitude and sizes in the real zens galaxy sample .",
    "the choice of a discretized but dense grid allows us to pinpoint the correction / uncertainty maps at well localized positions on the considered planes .",
    "as indicated above , the corrections for any given real zens galaxy are obtained by interpolation at the position of the zens galaxy in the _ observed _ @xmath167 space .            to discuss figures [ fig : gim2dcorrections ] and [ fig : zestcorrections ] it is useful to identify three regions in the @xmath168 plane : @xmath18 the region populated by models which are close to the surface brightness limit of the zens study ( indicated with the dashed black lines in the plot ) , @xmath19 the region of well - resolved , high - signal to noise ratio measurements , and @xmath22 the region close or below the size of the psf ( highlighted with a gray horizontal line ) .    above the detection and resolution limit , and at low ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 ) to intermediate ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) concentrations ,",
    "both gim2d and zest+ perform fairly well , and only small corrections are needed for both @xmath64 and magnitude .    not surprisingly , below the sky noise surface brightness , basically no galaxy can be recovered by both zest+ and gim2d , as models are a priori not detected during the sextractor source extraction ( necessary to define the total galaxy flux and the initial guess for the size needed as input by zest+ and gim2d ) . for galaxies with low concentration / srsic index , the detection rate falls rapidly to zero when the surface brightness limit is reached ( no model with @xmath173 and @xmath174kpc is recovered ) ; conversely , the centrally peaked light distribution in galaxies with higher concentration pushes the detection limit to slightly fainter surface brightnesses .",
    "close to the surface brightness limit , magnitude and sizes are severely underestimated for both gim2d and zest+ fits : sizes are typically smaller by more than a factor of two ( three ) and magnitudes are dimmer by half ( one ) magnitude for gim2d ( zest+ ) measurements .    at @xmath175 , the zest+  aperture \" measurements suffer from a strong underestimation of sizes and magnitudes at any signal - to - noise .",
    "this is a consequence of the well known tendency to miss a substantial fraction of the flux from the faint wings in steep light profiles when performing aperture photometry measurements .",
    "integration to total light mitigates this effect in the gim2d models , which nonetheless results in sizes which are about @xmath176 smaller than the intrinsic ones for extended galaxies with steep light profiles ( @xmath177 kpc ) .",
    "when moving close to the resolution limit of the survey , we notice further differences between the performance of zest+ and gim2d .",
    "thanks to the psf deconvolution , the analytical fits are able to reliable recover the sizes also for models with sizes below the psf fwhm .",
    "systematic effects become visible only at the worst observing condition ( see figure [ fig : gim2dcorrections_worst ] in appendix [ app : corrections_psf ] ) .",
    "zest+ suffers from much stronger biases in this regime , causing an artificial increase of the size of models with @xmath178 for any value of the seeing .",
    "we note however that our approach , being based on idealized , regular galaxy light distributions produced with gim2d , may return in general an optimistically good performance of gim2d than when recovering the parameters for real galaxies with irregular , clumpy light distributions .",
    "our corrections are thus to be considered as the  minimal \" correction functions that must be applied to the data to put the structural measurements on a comparable grid .      another clear effect observed for the zest+-based parameters",
    "is a lack of recovered parameters in the galaxy half - light radius @xmath64 vs. magnitude plane at high concentrations and small radii ( see right most panels of figure [ fig : zestcorrections ] ) ; this becomes increasingly more severe at higher ellipticities and larger psf fwhm ( see also figures [ fig : zestcorrections_best]-[fig : zestcorrections_worst ] ) .",
    "a similar trend is observed for the gim2d fits in the worst seeing conditions and at small radii ( figure [ fig : gim2dcorrections_worst ] ) .",
    "note that , consistently , the distribution of the real zens galaxy measurements based on zest+ in figure [ fig : zestcorrections ] presents the same bias .",
    "the origin of such effect is investigated in figure [ fig : zest_scatter ] , which illustrates where the artificial galaxies , created in a given region of the parameter space , are placed in the _ observed _ space . in this map ,",
    "the arrows indicate the direction in which models generated with a certain @xmath38 and @xmath4 are displaced relative to their intrinsic concentration and ellipticity : an upward - pointing arrow indicates that models are observed on average as less elongated , and a left - pointing arrow indicated that they are observed at lower concentrations .",

    "red - to - yellow squares indicate points in the grid in which at least @xmath179 ( up to 100% for full red squares ) of the artificial galaxies that are _ observed _ at that location originate from a different intrinsic concentration or ellipticity grid point .",
    "green points in the figure indicate grid nodes which are not affected by either scattering of galaxies into the grid point from different intrinsic concentration / ellipticity panels , or by scattering of galaxies out of the grid point into a different panel of observed ellipticity and/or concentration .",
    "it is clearly seen in figure [ fig : zest_scatter ] that model galaxies which were originally generated at high concentrations and ellipticities have a high probability to be scattered into lower @xmath38 and @xmath4 bins by the aperture - based zest measurements ; this bias is exacerbated at sizes @xmath180 kpc .",
    "this is caused by the effect of the psf convolution which artificially lowers a galaxy concentration and circularizes their axis ratio .",
    "consequently , this zest+ region of the @xmath168 plane out to @xmath181 psf radii is highly degenerate , being populated by both galaxies which have intrinsic parameters in that location of parameter space , and by galaxies which are scattered into it from higher ellipticity and/or concentration regions .",
    "given this degeneracy , it is important to verify to which extent the corrections for radii and magnitude that we discussed above depends on the precise way in which the simulation grid is populated . if model galaxies which are  scattered in \" and those which have intrinsic parameters in that location of parameter space required different corrections , then a precise modeling of the relative fractions of such galaxies in the given grid point would be needed .",
    "to test this , we created magnitude and sizes correction maps using either only artificial galaxies which were scattered into the given @xmath182 bin , or only galaxies born in situ .",
    "we show the outcome of such an experiment for the median psf in figure [ fig : zestcorrections_withnocontaminers ] in appendix [ app : corrections_psf ] .",
    "both realizations resulted in very similar corrections for size and magnitudes , indicating that these are robust independent of the intrinsic concentration / ellipticity of the galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "models which are scattered into lower @xmath4 or @xmath38 bins require by definition stronger corrections in @xmath38 and @xmath4 themselves than those which were generated within the bin . while for ellipticity it is reasonable to assume that also real ( disk ) galaxies would have an uniform distribution , and we hence can consider our corrections to be representative , the correction for concentration depends on the relative fraction of truly low concentration galaxies with respect to galaxies with a high intrinsic concentration .",
    "given that we have a no priori knowledge of the true distribution of concentrations for the real galaxies , and to avoid introducing biases associated to the choice of the simulation grid , we choose to follow a different method to correct the non - parametric structural estimators , which uses the available information on the srsic index . for data sets which do not have an as comprehensive set of measurements as zens",
    ", this approach could not be applied , and a statistical modeling of the underlying distribution of galaxies will be needed .",
    "these results should be taken as a cautionary note in using solely the concentration index as a morphological discriminant for galaxy types , especially if galaxies are close to the resolution limit of the given survey and if no correction to this parameter is attempted .",
    "conversely to the zest+ measurements , an equivalent map as in figure [ fig : zest_scatter ] , but for srsic indices and ellipticities measured by gim2d ( not shown ) demonstrates instead only a marginal contamination / scattering of galaxy models across the broad ellipticity and @xmath80 bins , thank to the psf - deconvolution performed by the gim2d fitting algorithm . for this reason",
    ", we apply to the ellipticities and srsic indices the corrections obtained by interpolating between the relevant grid points of the previously discussed vector maps , which we regard as statistically representative of the average correction .",
    "we stress however that systematic effects are observed for model galaxies convolved with the worst psf of zens : in this case , models with high srsic indices and sizes smaller than @xmath183 the psf size are scattered to lower @xmath80 .",
    "interestingly , gim2d tends to overestimate the ellipticity of such galaxies as opposed to what observed for the measurements performed with zest+ .",
    "furthermore , although under typical observing conditions the error on ellipticity and srsic index measured with gim2d are small enough to keep model galaxies within the same bin in these parameters , moving closer to the resolution or detection limit of the zens wfi images increases the randomicity in the measurements ; inferred ellipticities and srsic indices have a typical scatter of @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "we highlight these problematic regions with empty symbols in figure [ fig : gim2dcorrections ] .",
    "we finally note that a psf correction is often included  typically as a convolution - kernel in surface brightness fitting algorithms  in structural studies based on other ground - based datasets , including the sdss ( whose typical psf width is similar to the worst zens psf ; see e.g. , @xcite ) . as we show above , it is possible however that further residual ( size- , magnitude- , ellipticity- and concentration - dependent ) corrections to the structural parameters may be needed , depending on the specific psf , signal - to - noise and redshift of the studied samples .      to overcome potential biases associated with calculating a correction for the @xmath116 parameters which may depend on the distribution of intrinsic structural properties",
    ", we use the srsic indices of the galaxies from the gim2d fits as a prior .",
    "srsic indices are robustly determined in the vast majority of the models and are less prone to systematic biases , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the corrections for concentration , gini and @xmath128 indices are thus derived by splitting the artificial and real galaxies in similar bins of magnitude , radius , ellipticity and psf as those employed for the size corrections ( see figure [ fig : zestcorrections ] ) . in this case",
    "however we characterize the galaxy structure according to the observed srsic index rather than observed concentration , dividing the samples in three broad bins of @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "following the same approach as for sizes and magnitudes , the corrections for non - parametric structural estimators are then defined as the median difference between the models intrinsic indices and those calculated with zest+ at the given position in the observed @xmath189 parameter space .",
    "the intrinsic concentration is computed analytically from the input srsic index , as specified above , while for the gini and @xmath128 indices we use the measurements performed on  pure \" models that are neither psf - convolved nor degraded with the zens typical noise .",
    "given that our analysis is based on intrinsically smooth and axisymmetric models , we do not attempt to correct the asymmetry and smoothness index .",
    "these quantities will nonetheless be affected ( the smoothness possibly by the largest amount ) , and this caveat should hence be kept in mind . for the few zens galaxies for which no gim2d fit is available , we applied an average correction obtained as the median of the correction for the zens galaxies having gim2d fits and similar observed concentrations .",
    "a similar approach as the one employed for the single srsic fits was used to test the reliability of the gim2d bulge+disk ( b+d ) decompositions .",
    "all the b+d model galaxies were processed in exactly the same way as the real galaxies : i.e. , after the decomposition , the output models were filtered to reject the unphysical fits and to identify acceptable b+d decompositions ( see appendix [ app : filterbd ] ) .",
    "consistently with the approach used for the real galaxies , only these were used for deriving the correction functions for the b+d parameters .",
    "the correction maps for the b+d parameters are shown in figure [ fig : doublecorrdisks ] and [ fig : doublecorrbulges ] , for the three psfs . for bulges , we present the results for all disk inclinations together , as no strong dependence on the model axis ratio was detected .",
    "both scale lengths and magnitudes of disks are very well recovered by the gim2d code for most of the cases .",
    "systematic deviations from the input parameters are observed only for very small disks ( i.e. , @xmath190psf ) , especially for the largest psf size , and in the low surface brightness limit , where disk scale - lengths are underestimated by a factor of about two , and the measured magnitudes are systematically fainter than the input ones , as already discussed above .",
    "globally , in only @xmath7 of the cases the normalized difference between input and output disk sizes is larger than @xmath191 , and predominantly in the low surface brightness regime .",
    "the bulge parameter are instead subject to much larger uncertainties , as illustrated in figure [ fig : doublecorrbulges ] .",
    "although in many regions of the magnitude - size relation there are no systematic corrections , the scatter of measured bulge sizes around the input ones is generally large , typically @xmath192 for the measured bulge half - light radii . the strongest differences between input and output model parameters are measured for bulges with high srsic indices ( @xmath193 ) in which case a substantial over - estimation of bulge effective radii is observed .",
    "low srsic index bulges ( leftmost panels in the figure ) suffer from smaller measurement errors .",
    "below the resolution limit and for the worst psf , sizes are over - estimated also for bulges with @xmath194 whereas the effect is less evident for the best or intermediate psf .",
    "these uncertainties in the bulges sizes reflects in ( or are possibly generated by ) a general difficulty in recovering the correct bulge srsic index . as an illustration of this fact , we plot on the top panel of figure [ fig : btscatter ] the comparison between input and measured bulge srsic indices for the median psf .",
    "it can be noticed how the measured srsic index , especially below @xmath195 , can deviate substantially from the model intrinsic values .",
    "this particularly severe for bulges with half - light radii which are close to the psf size : small bulges with low index @xmath80 can be misclassified as bulges with larger half - light radii and steeper light profiles .",
    "although the structural properties of the bulges are subject to relatively large uncertainties , the fractional contribution of the bulge to the total light is generally well measured by the gim2d decompositions , as shown on the middle panel of figure [ fig : btscatter ] . in the bottom panel",
    "we plot , for a given value of the observed bulge - to - total ratio , the fraction of input models which where originated with a @xmath100 which differed less than 0.15 from the measured one , between 0.15 and 0.3 and more than 0.3 ( black , gray and red lines respectively ) . in @xmath8680 - 85@xmath27 of the cases",
    "the bulge - to - total ratio is recovered within a scatter of 0.15 and really catastrophic failures ( @xmath196 ) happen in @xmath197 of the models .",
    "it is worth to notice that the fraction of galaxies for which the @xmath100 is robustly recovered is largely independent of the value of @xmath100 itself , and the typical scatter around the input bulge - to - total ratio is of order @xmath198 .",
    "problematic fits which results in large differences in @xmath100 are again mostly associated with flat ( @xmath199 ) and small ( @xmath200kpc@xmath201psf ) bulges , for which is difficult to disentangle the disk component from the small , disk - like bulge .    in the light of these results we decided _ not _ to apply any corrections to the bulge and disks structural parameters : on the one hand disk sizes are well recovered by the gim2d fits , hence no substantial correction is needed ; on the other hand , the large scatter in the recovered bulge half - light radii and srsic indices make the derived corrections noisy and dependent on the specific sampling of parameter space with our simulations . for this reason , we prefer to use the direct output from gim2d for the bulge half - light radii , but with associated a typical uncertainty of 30@xmath27 , as estimated from our tests .        in the top panel",
    "we show the comparison between the intrinsic bulge srsic indices for the set of simulated galaxies used to test the reliability of gim2d bulge+disk decompositions , and those recovered by gim2d .",
    "the variation @xmath202 corresponds to the difference between the intrinsic and measured values .",
    "with black points we highlight models for which the structural parameters are well recovered , i.e. , have relative error @xmath203 . in dark gray",
    "are the points which have a fractional error between @xmath179 and @xmath204 , and in gray ( red in the online version ) are the extreme outliers with errors which are @xmath205 .",
    "the reported fractions are the fraction of discrepant models relative to the total in the three bins of srsic index @xmath80 shown in the figure . in the central panel",
    "we show the comparison of intrinsic and measured bulge - to - total ratios ( b / t ) for the model galaxies .",
    "black shows models for which @xmath206 , dark gray those with @xmath207 and gray ( red in the online version ) is for models for which the measured b / t deviates more than 0.3 from the intrinsic value .",
    "the fraction of models within each of the three types , as a function of the _ observed _ b / t , is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal.),width=264 ]      we present a number of diagnostic tests that we performed to verify the reliability of the corrections for the structural parameters that are described in section [ sec : correctionmaps ] and [ sec : ginicorr ] .    as a first sanity check we run our correction scheme , in exactly the same fashion as for the real galaxies , on the measured properties for the models themselves ; the outcome of this exercise",
    "is illustrated in the upper panels of figure [ fig : zest_gim2dcorectioncomp ] for sizes obtained with gim2d and zest+ , for models convolved with the median psf . the intrinsic ( input ) and corrected radii for the model galaxies agree very well , and systematic biases that are present in the uncorrected sizes are largely cured by our correction scheme .",
    "furthermore , the large discrepancies between the zest+ and gim2d raw measurements disappear in the corrected data .",
    "the bottom panels in figure [ fig : zest_gim2dcorectioncomp ] show the comparisons of zest+ and gim2d half - light radii , ellipticities and @xmath17band magnitudes , before and after the application of our correction schemes for the real zens galaxies .",
    "the raw sizes derived by zest+ are systematically smaller than those obtained by the gim2d fits , by up to a factor of @xmath208 in the worst cases .",
    "our correction scheme nicely brings the two estimate into a very good agreement . as a consequence of the psf convolution",
    ", galaxies are also measured to be rounder in zest+ than in gim2d , especially at low radii , a bias which is largely cured by the implementation of the correction scheme .",
    "the latter also mitigates the underestimation of the total fluxes in zest+ .",
    "the comparison between uncorrected and corrected @xmath10-band @xmath4 , gini and @xmath128 indices is shown in figure [ fig : zest+_corrected ] . specifically , to test whether our corrections deal properly with psf - induced biases , we compare , for corrected and uncorrected measurements , the distributions of these parameters for two bins of psf size , i.e. , psf @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "the uncorrected indices show different distributions for galaxies observed with small or large psf s fwhm .",
    "the effect is mostly evident for the concentration parameter , for which a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test rejects the possibility that the low and high fwhm samples are drawn from the same parent distribution at the @xmath211 confidence level .",
    "a similar effect is also noticeable for the @xmath128 index ; the gini coefficient is instead less sensitive to psf blurring .",
    "all such biases disappear once our corrections are applied , as shown in the lower panels of the same figure .",
    "the inspection of the distributions of figure [ fig : zest+_corrected ] furthermore shows that the corrections recover the peak of high @xmath4 values for the early - type galaxies , which would otherwise be absent from the raw measurements ; similarly , the peak at  more negative \" values is recovered in the corrected @xmath128 distributions .",
    "this is also highlighted in figure [ fig : zest_vs_sersic ] , where we show the comparison between corrected and uncorrected non - parametric structural estimators and the corrected srsic indices .",
    "the upper - left panel shows the comparison for the concentration index : the solid red line marks the expected values of the concentration inside the petrosian radius for a perfect srsic profile of a given index @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that before correction , the measured concentration flattens rapidly at values @xmath212 for @xmath213 , lying far away from the theoretical line . after applying our correction ,",
    "the measured points well match this line .",
    "a similar adjustment is also observed for the @xmath128 index , while , as already mentioned , the gini coefficient is measured quite robustly and needs virtually no corrections .",
    "the upper right inset show the dependence on ellipticity of uncorrected concentration and @xmath128 parameters for galaxies classified as disks in section [ sec : morphclass ] ; the spurious lack of high concentration galaxies at high elongation is largely ameliorated by our correction scheme .",
    "we stress in concluding that all our corrections are clearly  statistical \" . for example",
    ", individual models can retain an underestimation of the radius of up to a factor @xmath176 , especially models close to the surface brightness limit of the zens observations .",
    "nevertheless , in a statistical sense , our correction schemes return well - calibrated measurements that can be robustly compared with each other .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : shencomp ] a comparison between the mass - size relation obtained for the zens galaxies , both before and after applying the corrections outlined in section [ sec : correctionmaps ] , and the relation derived by @xcite in sdss .",
    "the shen s sizes are from the srsic fits of @xcite , and are thus similar to the sizes of the vagc catalogue ( see appendix [ sec : testgim2d ] for a one - to - one comparison between our measurements and the blanton et al data ) .",
    "circularized apertures are used in this comparison , to match the shen et al . definition .",
    "not surprisingly , given the global robustness of the structural parameters of disks , and more generally low srsic index galaxies , the @xcite size - mass relation for the late - type galaxies is in excellent agreement with our relation .",
    "the shen s sizes for the early - types are however systematically underestimated relative to our measurements , a difference which is further increased after the application of our corrections . in this respect ,",
    "we note again that the sdss data were typically acquired with a typical @xmath214-band psf of @xmath861.5@xmath215 , which is comparable to the worst seeing in the @xmath17band zens data , and no residual corrections as a function of size , magnitude , concentration and inclination effects ( as done in this paper ) were attempted in the sdss analysis .",
    "using our uncorrected sizes , the difference in size estimates is @xmath216 at @xmath217 , and increases towards lower galaxy masses , up to @xmath218 at @xmath219 .",
    "the median size of the shen et al .",
    "early - type galaxy at this latter mass scale is @xmath220kpc , while our corresponding estimate is 2.2 ( 2.4 ) kpc before ( after ) the application of our corrections .",
    "we attribute the difference in size estimates between our analysis and shen s to the combination of three factors : @xmath93 in zens the half - light radii are obtained using elliptical apertures , in contrast with the circular apertures used in the sdss study .",
    "although we have partly corrected for this difference in a post - processing mode , by circularizing our measurements for the comparison in figure [ fig : shencomp ] , residual differences may remain ; these differences are likely more relevant at relatively smaller sizes and relatively higher srsic indices ; @xmath95 the use of different upper limits for the srsic index in the sdss and zens fits , see appendix [ sec : appnyvagc ] ; @xmath97 different morphological mixes in the two samples , since shen et al .",
    "use a simple split in srsic index to define their morphological classes ; and @xmath99 finally , of course , to the fact that the shen et al measurements were not corrected by observational biases as we do for our zens sample .",
    "the availability of a large suite of structural diagnostics for the zens galaxies enables us to perform an accurate and quantitative morphological classification , eliminating biases and dilution of signal in studies of galaxy properties as a function of morphology .",
    "we classified the zens galaxies into six morphological classes , primarily based on the prominence of the bulge component in the i - band .",
    "these classes are , respectively , ellipticals , bulge - dominated disks  further divided into s0 and bulge - dominated spirals  intermediate - type disks , late - type disks and irregular galaxies .",
    "the stamp images of the galaxies of different morphological types are shown in figures [ fig : stampe]-[fig : stampmergers ] in appendix [ app : classdist ] .",
    "a flow - chart schematic description of the steps applied in our morphological classification scheme is shown in figure [ pic : classflowchart ] , in which we also list the fraction of each morphological type in the zens database .    in detail , our classification criteria are as follows .",
    "ellipticals are required to be well fitted by a single srsic profile with _ corrected _ srsic index @xmath221 and normalized residuals smaller than @xmath110 out to the sky level of the image ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we present the @xmath10-band surface brightness profiles for all elliptical galaxies in figure [ fig : ellipticalprofiles ] : by definition , the light distribution of such galaxies is perfectly represented by a single ( corrected ) @xmath221 srsic model .",
    "the distinction among different disk types is based on the following criteria : galaxies with @xmath222 are assigned to the late - type disk class , those with @xmath223 are classified as intermediate - type disks and those with @xmath224 as bulge - dominated galaxies . for many reasons , including a good degree of mixing of physical classes in the visual classification of the third reference catalog ( rc3 ,",
    "* ) , we will refrain from using its popular nomenclature .",
    "we note however that , albeit with scatter , our bulge - to - total separation for disk galaxies roughly corresponds to a division in types s0 plus s0a / sa , sab / sbc and sc / sm , in order of decreasing b / t range .    both s0 and spiral galaxies with large bulges fall in the bulge - dominated galaxies category .",
    "the distinction among the two is based on the @xmath9-band smoothness parameter @xmath225 , which is set to @xmath226@xmath227 for s0 and larger than this value for early - type spirals , except in those case where faint spiral arms  not prominent enough to cause a variation of the smoothness parameter  are clearly seen in the visual inspection of the images . for nearly edge - on system",
    "it is obviously impossible to determine the presence or absence of spiral arms and the difference between s0 and bulge dominated spiral galaxies becomes more challenging . given that we have no means to securely distinguish these morphological types at these high inclinations , we assigned to the bulge - dominated spiral class those galaxies which satisfy the b / t criterion above , and either present a dust lane in the disk plane or have a high @xmath16band smoothness parameter ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "as seen in figures [ fig : stamps0 ] and [ fig : stampsa ] , a large fraction of the highly - inclined galaxies are classified as bulge dominated spirals , and only those which clearly do not have a dusty disk are defined as s0 .",
    "the contamination of s0 galaxies into the bulge - dominated spiral class is hence likely non - negligible at the highest inclinations ; a comparison between the relative fractions for face - on galaxies estimates this contamination at the 33% level .",
    "the distinction between s0 and elliptical galaxies is also non trivial , this time especially in face - on systems . to attempt to distinguish between these two classes we inspected all the residuals of the single component fits and",
    "any sign of a faint disk component was used as a discriminant diagnostic .",
    "finally the @xmath9-band smoothness @xmath115 parameter was used to further validate the separation between the two types , by requiring that for s0 @xmath229 , a condition which is however secondary to the fact of s0 not being perfectly fit by a single sersic model .",
    "we note that for @xmath230 of all zens galaxies that were not classified as ellipticals or irregulars , and that would therefore be assigned a  disk \" classification , it was not possible to obtain a reliable @xmath10-band bulge+disk decomposition ( see appendix [ sec : testgim2d ] ) . in these cases",
    "the classification is based on the corrected srsic indices from the single component fits , as shown in the right hand side of figure [ pic : classflowchart ] .",
    "for the very few galaxies ( @xmath231 ) for which we could not obtain any reliable bulge+disk decomposition or srsic index , we used the _ corrected _ zest+ parameters ( in particular the concentration ) to define their morphological class .",
    "specifically , in such few cases , galaxies with @xmath232 were assigned to the late - type disk class , those with @xmath233 to the intermediate - type disks and galaxies with @xmath234 to the bulge - dominated spiral class .",
    "the precise values of these cuts were determined through the relation between @xmath80 and @xmath4 in figure [ fig : zestclasses ] .",
    "irregular ( i.e. , thus possibly disturbed by mergers / encounters ) galaxies are identified in the zens sample by visual inspection ; in this category we included those galaxies which have no clear disk / bulge component or have a highly disturbed morphology characterized by multiple clumps , as shown in figure [ fig : stampmergers ] .",
    "there are furthermore 26 galaxy - pairs or triplets in the zens sample which are also possible merger candidates , of which we show stamp images in figure [ fig : stampmergers ] .",
    "these galaxy pairs are identified as single objects in 2dfgrs , and appear as single members in the group catalog , i.e. , they have only one redshift measurements in the 2dfgrs catalogue . for nine of such systems ,",
    "we confirmed with sdss @xcite spectral or photometric redshifts , or with spectroscopic data available in the ned database , that the two galaxies are at the same redshift , strengthening the hypothesis that they are undergoing a merger event .",
    "there are 17 remaining galaxies pairs , for which no such information is available .",
    "we note that five pairs / triplets show tidal features and disturbed morphologies , supporting the merger scenario ; the remaining 12 pairs display less clear signs of interactions , and hence for them a chance projection can not be excluded .",
    "we will include nonetheless the latter in the sample of merger galaxies and , when necessary , test our results with and without these systems ; these are flagged as ` possible projections ' in our zens catalogue .    for consistency with the original 2dfgrs and 2pigg catalogs , we count the merging galaxies as a single galaxy pair system in the sample of 1455 galaxies , but we compute and provide photometric / structural properties for the individual members ( thus making the total entries in the public zens catalog equal to 1484 ) . in the",
    " normal \" disk population , there are furthermore some galaxies which present clear tidal features and disk distortions ; such galaxies are flagged has having plausibly undergone a recent galaxy - galaxy interaction or merger .",
    "finally we also flag as candidate mergers those zens galaxies which , although identified as individual objects in the parent 2dfgrs/2pigg catalog , are found at a distance from another confirmed group member which is smaller or equal to the maximal separation observed in the above 26 galaxy pairs ( i.e. 48@xmath164 , roughly 50 kpc at the average zens redshift ) and have a velocity difference from it @xmath235 500km / s .",

    "there is , of course , a correlation between @xmath100 and @xmath4 characterized by a linear correlation coefficient of @xmath237 .",
    "however , the scatter is large and a given concentration value can be associated with a broad range of b / t ratios , as illustrated in the top right panel of figure [ fig : c_vs_bt ] .",
    "we emphasize that the _ uncorrected _ values of concentration lead to a much larger scatter , which results in a weaker correlation between @xmath100 and uncorrected c with @xmath238 .",
    "we highlight with colors in figure [ fig : c_vs_bt ] two regions of parameter space which are worth noticing , i.e. , that of galaxies with @xmath239 and @xmath240 ( red points ) and that of @xmath241 and @xmath242 ( blue points ) .",
    "as illustrated in the bottom panels of the same figure , highly concentrated galaxies with low @xmath100 ratios are found below the bulk of the population in the relation between the bulge half - light radius and the disk scale length ; the srsic indices of their bulges are in most of the cases ( @xmath243 ) above @xmath244 .",
    "such objects hence host dense but small bulges , which are causing an increase in the concentration value but do not give a major contribution to the total galaxy light .",
    "the blue points at low @xmath4 and high @xmath100 , in contrast , are galaxies with typically extended bulges with low srsic index ( i.e. , pseudo - bulge like structures , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for a review and further references ) .        in figure [",
    "fig : inclinationc ] we furthermore show the different corrected structural indices for the morphological classes , as a function of the galaxy inclination .",
    "the distribution of corrected parameters for each individual class are fairly flat with ellipticity , as they should ( in contrast with the non - corrected parameters , which we have shown to have a bias with ellipticity ; see section [ sec : reliabilitycorrections ] and figure [ fig : zest_vs_sersic ] ) .",
    "note the galaxy smoothness maintains a substantial dependence on inclination by increasing towards higher inclinations ; this parameter has not been corrected , since we used only smooth galaxy models to determine our correction matrices .",
    "part of the dependence of @xmath115 on ellipticity might thus be a residual observational bias ; part might however be a consequence of the prominence of dust lanes in edge - on galaxies .",
    "dust absorption in the disk could also in principle artificially lower the derived bulge - to - total ratios for edge - on galaxies ( see for example @xcite ) , and hence introduce a bias in the b / t - based morphological classification .",
    "we expect this effect to be minimal in our analysis , since we use the relatively unaffected @xmath17band to derive our fiducial @xmath100 estimates , but it is nonetheless worthwhile to test whether there are indication of biases among the morphological classes given that some attenuation of the disk ( and bulge ) light is certainly occurring .    in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : inclinationc ]",
    "we plot the distributions of ellipticity for disk galaxies with bulge - to - total ratio @xmath245 ( blue histogram ) , @xmath246 ( green histogram ) , and @xmath247 ( red histogram ) . for @xmath248",
    "we find a reasonable constancy with ellipticity of the relative contribution of three disk types to the total disk population , indicating that there are no major biases in this regime . at higher axis ratios ,",
    "there is a depletion of @xmath249 galaxies and an increase of the  bulgeless \" disk galaxies , which we interpret mostly as a consequence of a true change in the morphological mix rather than of strong dust absorption .",
    "the presence of a bulge component , even in highly - inclined disks , produces a rounding of the isophotes and thus of the measured axis ratio .",
    "therefore , the decrease in the number of bulge - dominated galaxies and intermediate - type disks at @xmath250 likely reflects this correlation between `` morphology '' and measured ellipticity .",
    "likewise , the peak of @xmath251 disk galaxies at @xmath252 can be explained by the  rounding \" of isophotes due to psf effects in these galaxies and the intrinsic galaxy thickness . indeed no galaxy is observed at @xmath253 and",
    "the fraction of @xmath251 disk galaxies with @xmath254 relative to the total sample of disk galaxies is @xmath8625@xmath27 , i.e. , if they were ( infinitely thin disks and ) equally distributed up to @xmath255 , each of the four 0.1-wide bins between @xmath256 would contain 6@xmath27 of the sample , which is the average number observed at lower axis ratios .    to further test whether the estimates of galaxy bulge - to - total ratio are strongly affected by dust extinction , we compare in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : inclinationc ] the difference between the b / t values measured in the @xmath16band and those measured in the @xmath17band , as function of the galaxy ellipticity . in grey",
    "we show the full zens sample ; other colors are the results for galaxy samples split in the three b / t classes discussed as above .",
    "the @xmath17band b / t values are typically larger by about 5% than those in the @xmath9 filter , which is consistent with larger dust absorption effects at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "there is however no clear variation with @xmath38 of the difference @xmath257 within each of the three morphological classes .",
    "we thus conclude that dust effects are generally a modest contribution to the total error budget for the b / t measurements , which is dominated by other sources of random and systematic errors ( see figure [ fig : btscatter ] and the corresponding discussion in the text ) .",
    "we note that other authors have combined empirical disk attenuation - inclination relations with theoretical dust models in order to derive inclination - dependent corrections for dust absorption in bulge and disk fluxes ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the @xmath10-band parameters in table 1 of @xcite together with their equations 1 and 2 , we estimate a correction of order of @xmath258 to the zens @xmath10-band b / t values , comparable with or even smaller than the typical uncertainty on the b / t measurements . while such corrections could be important in some contexts , they inherit the uncertainties on the adopted dust models and would not cause a significant shift of morphological class in the zens sample .",
    "we hence choose not to apply any such ( model - dependent ) dust correction , and to adopt the dust - uncorrected gim2d measurements of b / t as our fiducial estimates for this parameter .    in summary , the above considerations , and the constancy of the median b / t ratio for the different morphological classes in three ellipticity bins shown in table [ tab : classmedian ] ,",
    "lead us to conclude that our @xmath100 measurements are largely independent of axis ratio and that our morphological classification is thus largely unaffected by inclination effects .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that the @xmath80 srsic indices of intermediate - type disks also show a residual ( but marginal ) dependence on ellipticity : this is of course the morphological class for which the likely similar light contribution of bulge and disk components along the line - of - sight is the most difficult to disentangle",
    ". nevertheless , the @xmath80 values spanned by these morphological class at the different ellipticities are consistently in the  intermediate \" range of @xmath259 ( see table [ tab : classmedian ] ) , providing a consistent characterization of these systems across the whole ellipticity range .",
    "the main goal of zens is to study galaxy properties , at fixed stellar mass and hubble type , as a function of several environmental parameters derived self - consistently for the same galaxy sample , i.e. , the host halo mass , the large scale density @xmath260 and the projected group - centric distance .",
    "we furthermore split the zens galaxy sample in central galaxies in their host group halos , and satellite galaxies , which orbit the central galaxies within those halos ( see paper i for the precise definition of central and satellite galaxies , and for the environmental parameters ) .",
    "several zens analyses are underway , which use the zens database , including the structural and morphological information derived in this paper , to investigate how galaxy structural and morphological properties vary across the different environmental regimes .    in this second paper in the zens series",
    "we want to show a first utilization of the structural measurements presented above to answer , from a purely observational perspective , a simple question , namely how the concentration of _ satellite galaxies _ depends , at fixed stellar mass , on @xmath93 hubble type , and @xmath95 on group mass , group - centric distance and large - scale structure density .      galaxy structure , as described by the concentration parameter , is a strong function of galaxy mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we have discussed above , concentration is however a relatively poor indicator of galaxy morphology ( when this is defined according to a more physical parameter such as the bulge - to - total ratio , as we do for the zens galaxies ) .",
    "furthermore , morphology also is a function of stellar mass ( see paper iii and also , e.g. , @xcite ) . with available robust (",
    "corrected ) concentration values , and a b / t - based morphological classification , we thus investigate how much of the concentration vs. galaxy stellar mass correlation is to be ascribed to a variation in the hubble type of galaxies , and how much is actually driven by a real change in concentration within each individual morphological types .",
    "stellar masses are taken from paper iii .",
    "the results of this analysis will also help us interpret the analysis of satellites concentration in the different environmental parameters , for which , in order to gain statistics , we will use broader morphological classes .    figure [ fig : cmass ] shows the corrected concentration as a function of galaxy stellar mass .",
    "the points connected with lines are the median concentrations for satellite galaxies , divided according to the morphological types ( note that s0 and bulge - dominated spiral galaxies are joined together into a single broad morphological bin of  bulge - dominated \" galaxies ) .",
    "the medians were calculated using a running box above the mass completeness of each morphological type ( the results are noisier but consistent when using independent mass bins ) .",
    "the inspection of this figure shows an increase in concentration with increasing galaxy stellar mass at fixed morphological type for disk galaxies .",
    "specifically , our elliptical satellites sample covers a small range of stellar mass ( @xmath261 ) , over which the concentration is observed to remain constant . for all types of disk galaxies where the range of masses covered is larger ,",
    "a trend of concentration with stellar mass is clearly observable , separately for each morphological disk type ( the latter defined according to the galaxy bulge - to - total ratios as described in section [ sec : morphclass ] ) .",
    "we note that residual bulge - to - disk variations with stellar mass _ within _ each morphological disk class are possible , since our morphological classification was done independent of galaxy stellar mass , and each morphological bin covers a relatively broad range of bulge - to - total ratio .",
    "quantitatively , however , the a posteriori computation of the median bulge - to - total ratios vary , between the mass bin centered at @xmath262 and the mass bin centered at @xmath263 , only from 59@xmath27 to 60@xmath27 , 34@xmath27 to @xmath264 , and @xmath265 to @xmath266 , respectively for bulge - dominated , intermediate - type and late - type disk galaxies .",
    "thus , we conclude that the known concentration - mass correlation is not solely driven by a correlation between morphological type and stellar mass , but is , at least partially , driven also by a genuine increase in concentration of galaxies of similar hubble type , i.e. , of similar bulge - to - total ratio .",
    "we fit the observed trends of corrected concentration versus galaxy stellar mass with a linear relation , @xmath267 , in the mass range which is probed by all morphological type , i.e. , for those bins which are above @xmath28 for their full width .",
    "the global @xmath268 relation for the late - type disks shows a break around @xmath269 , below which mass the relation flattens ; a linear fit is however a good approximation at @xmath270 where we can make a meaningful comparison with the other types .",
    "the slopes @xmath271 for the four morphological classes above this threshold mass are , respectively , @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 ; satellite elliptical galaxies are consistent with no dependence of concentration on the galaxy mass , i.e @xmath275 .",
    "although , as commented above , the lack of dependence of @xmath4 on stellar mass for the ellipticals is established only across a relatively limited mass range , generally speaking this finding follows the global trend , established on the disk galaxies , of a flattening of the @xmath4 vs. galaxy stellar mass relation from the later- to the earlier morphological type .      at the masses of our study ,",
    "there are essentially no irregular satellite galaxies ; furthermore , elliptical galaxies contribute only 5% to the total number of satellites in the zens sample at these masses .",
    "the small number of elliptical satellites does not enable us to perform a statistically significant analysis of their dependence on environment .",
    "since the vast majority ( @xmath106 ) of satellites in the sample are disk galaxies , we choose to maximize morphological `` purity '' in our analysis of the dependence of satellite concentration on the different environmental parameters by limiting it to to the sample of _ disk _ satellites only .        in figure",
    "[ fig : cmassgrp ] we present the ( corrected ) concentration vs. galaxy stellar mass relation for disk satellite galaxies , split into two broad morphological bins of  bulge - dominated \" galaxies and  disk - dominated \" galaxies by adding together s0s and bulge - dominated spirals in one bin , and intermediate - type and late - type disks in the other bin .",
    "the relation is plotted separately as function of group mass @xmath1 , lss ( over)density @xmath3 , and group - centric distance @xmath276 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the broad bulge - dominated galaxies bin is split in three bins of galaxy stellar mass , i.e. , @xmath277[9.5,9.9 [ , [ 9.9,10.45 [ , [ 10.45,10.88 ] ; we use only two bins of galaxy stellar mass for the broad bulge - dominated galaxies bin , i.e. , @xmath277[10.,10.6[,@xmath278 .    before discussing the results we present some considerations on the biases and uncertainties which may affect the analysis .",
    "first , we remind that trends with group mass that we measure are , intrinsically , possibly even stronger .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the uncertainty on our group mass estimates tends to  wash out \" trends with this environmental quantity ; quantitatively , real trends with group mass have slopes @xmath279 steeper on average than what we can measure in the zens sample .    in paper",
    "i we furthermore discuss a classification of the zens groups into  relaxed \" and  unrelaxed \" groups , according to whether a self - consistent solution for a central galaxy can be found ( in relaxed groups ) or not ( in unrelaxed groups ) .",
    "the latter are expected to be combination of genuinely dynamically young , merging structures , contaminated by physically relaxed groups for which several observational biases prevent us to properly identify their central galaxy . in the spirit of checking that our results are not affected by the inclusion of the unrelaxed groups in our studies , in figure [",
    "fig : cmassgrp ] we show the results for all zens groups ( left panels ) and for the subset of relaxed groups only ( right panels ) when studying the dependence of the @xmath4-mass relation on either @xmath1 or @xmath276 .",
    "we furthermore exclude from the following analysis those galaxies which are located at group - centric distances @xmath280 . in some of the zens groups",
    "relatively massive galaxies are found to lie in the outskirts of the group . as discussed above , this is partially a consequence of observational limitations but it may also be the signature of on - going accretion of sub - haloes .",
    "the sample selection at @xmath281 thus helps minimizing the contamination at these large radii of in - falling substructures and maximizing the  purity \" of galaxies that are satellites within a single common halo .    in paper",
    "i we also comment on the fact that , at group masses above @xmath282 , group mass @xmath1 and lss ( over)density @xmath3 are correlated by nature , since massive groups are found by definition only in dense regions of the lss . in contrast , groups of masses @xmath283 are found at any value of @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus possible to disentangle the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath3 by limiting the studies as a function of @xmath3 to group masses below this threshold .",
    "we adopt this strategy here as well , and , in order to search for a dependence of the @xmath4-mass relation for satellites on @xmath3 , we test that the results obtained when including all groups in the analysis with @xmath3 ( left central panel ) hold also when restricting the group sample to groups with @xmath284 ( right central panel ) .",
    "having established that the concentration parameter is a function of both galaxy stellar mass and morphological type ( see figure [ fig : cmass ] ) , it is important to keep dependencies of both factors with the environment under control in order to proceed in this analysis . in paper",
    "iii we discuss the variation of the stellar mass of each broad morphological type with our environmental indicators and show that in our sample galaxy mass is largely independent of environment at fixed morphological type .    here",
    "we note that , for the broad disk - dominated galaxies bin , biases in the median mass with any of the environments are not an issue , as for this class we can afford a fine galaxy mass bin splitting , and compare the @xmath4-mass relation for different environments within relatively small galaxy mass bins .",
    "for the broad bulge - dominated galaxies bin , however , given the fairly broad ranges covered by each of the two galaxy stellar mass bins , a difference in the median galaxy stellar mass ( and , more generally , of the galaxy stellar mass distributions ) between some of the different environments could in principle be present .",
    "this could induce a spurious dependence on such environments of the @xmath4 vs.  stellar mass relations plotted in figure [ fig : cmassgrp ] . to keep this potential bias under control , we computed the median galaxy stellar masses within each environmental bin , and found that , for all three environments under study , the median stellar mass of galaxies in the broad bulge - dominated galaxies morphological bin changes by less than 0.1 dex between the environmental bins under comparison ( i.e. , low / high @xmath1 , @xmath3 and inner / outer group regions ) .",
    "we also verified if the morphological mix changes substantially with environment .",
    "the fractional contribution of intermediate - type disk galaxies to the total intermediate- plus late - type disk populations which compose the broad disk - dominated galaxies morphological bin defined above varies at most by @xmath285 between the low / high @xmath1 samples .",
    "precisely , in the three bins of galaxy stellar mass defined for the broad disk - dominated galaxies morphological bin this fractional contribution , i.e. , @xmath286 , equals , respectively , 35% , 55% , 85% for @xmath287 and 36% , 56% , 82% for @xmath288 .",
    "the fractional contribution of s0s to the broad bulge - dominated galaxies morphological bin is also almost identical between the samples of @xmath287 and @xmath288 , and equal to @xmath230 at @xmath289 and @xmath290 at @xmath291 .",
    "likewise at @xmath292 , the maximal variation in the fraction of intermediate galaxies within the disk - dominated galaxies class is 5% across the two @xmath3 bins . on the other hand ,",
    "variations of @xmath293 are detected in the contributions of s0s to the broad bulge - dominated morphological bin between samples at small / large group - centric distances and low / high lss ( over)densities at @xmath294 ; hence we use caution in interpreting , for this broad morphological type , possible differences in the @xmath4 vs. galaxy stellar mass relation at these mass scales .    the first thing to realize from figure [ fig : cmassgrp ]",
    "is that there are at most weak trends with the different environments of the concentration vs. stellar mass relation for disk satellite galaxies .",
    "two environmental trends are however potentially important :    @xmath295 there is a global trend at and above galaxy masses of order @xmath262 , for satellites with a bulge - dominated morphology to be , albeit at the @xmath296-level , systematically more concentrated , by about 5 - 10% , at low environmental densities ( large group - centric distances and low lss densities ) than at high environmental densities ( high mass groups , small group - centric distances , high lss densities )",
    ". this difference could be at least partially driven by a change in the mix between s0 and bulge - dominated spirals within the broad bulge dominated morphological bin .",
    "@xmath297 in contrast , the disk - dominated population shows a systematic increase in median concentration , at fixed galaxy stellar mass above @xmath28 , with increasing group mass and lss density . in this case the similar contributions of intermediate - type disks and late - type disks to the broad disk - dominated morphological bin suggest that there is a genuine environmental effect at work .",
    "the difference in concentration between low and high mass groups is @xmath298 ; furthermore , the effect is robust towards the inclusion / exclusion of the sample of unrelaxed groups .",
    "the significance of this concentration difference , as assed through a @xmath299-test on the two samples , gives a probability @xmath300 that the two populations have truly different median concentrations ( or a kolmogorov - smirnov test give a 95% probability of a common parent distribution ) .",
    "on the other hand , the trend with @xmath3 becomes weaker when only groups with @xmath287 are considered for the lss analysis .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the effect observed with @xmath3 when also the most massive groups are included is likely a spurious reflection of the dependence of concentration on halo mass .",
    "as indicated above , a full investigation of the implications of either of these trends is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will study these effects in more detail , also within the framework set by other independent analyses of the satellite population , in a future zens analysis .",
    "we have presented detailed structural analyses performed on the 1455 galaxies in the 141 zens groups introduced in paper i. we remark that the corresponding zens catalogue has however 1484 galaxy with valid entries , since we measure parameters for individual galaxies that are members of 29 galaxy pairs , which are given as one single entry in the parent 2dfgrs galaxy catalogue .",
    "the parametric and non - parametric structural measurements presented here , together with the detailed environmental parameters from paper i and the photometric ( including stellar masses ) measurements presented in paper iii , set the basis for a number of forthcoming publications which use the zens data to explore which environmental scales are relevant for the evolution of morphologically different galaxy populations at different mass scales .",
    "the measurements are published in the global zens catalog with paper i. in detail , the measurements that we have presented here are :    * strength of bars in disks , quantified through an isophotal analysis ( section [ sec : isophotalanalysis ] ) ; * single- and double - component ( bulge+disk ) srsic fits parameters both in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands , including model - based galaxy sizes ( sections [ sec : sersicfits ] and [ sec : gim2d_decomp ] ) , as well as bulge+disk+bar fits for disks with a noticeable bar component ( appendix [ app : bulgebardisk ] ) ; * non - parametric structural indices of concentration , asymmetry , smoothness of the light distribution , and gini and @xmath128 coefficients , and ",
    "aperture photometric \" size estimates ( section [ sec : zest ] ) ; * morphological classes , based on a quantitative bulge+disk criterion , augmented ( or supported ) by quantitative criteria regarding the non - parametric diagnostics , after correction for observational biases ( sections [ sec : gim2d_decomp ] and [ sec : morphclass ] ) .",
    "crucially , we do indeed derive correction matrices , which we apply to the relevant structural estimates , to minimize biases which , depending on psf size as well as galaxy magnitude , size , shape of light profile and ellipticity , would otherwise prevent a reliable comparison of the structural properties of galaxies observed in different seeing conditions , and lying in different regions of this four - dimensional galaxy parameter space ( see section [ sec : simulations ] ) .",
    "as expected , biases in the model - fit parameters are substantially reduced thanks to the treatment of the psf - blurring effects in these algorithms ; still , some are present even in the model - fit parameters , which may have an impact in some analyses if left uncorrected .",
    "disk properties are well measured and require very modest or no further corrections ; so are bulge - to - total ratios , which therefore offer an excellent parameter to base a quantitative morphological / structural classification . in contrast , bulge @xmath80 srsic indices and half - light radii are degenerate in some circumstances .",
    "this implies that , on global galactic scales , concentration parameter or n - srsic index , alone , are not a good proxy for bulge - to - disk ratio and thus morphology : bulges can give large contributions to the total light budget and have large half - light radii , leading to low galaxy concentrations , or , vice - versa , bulges can be very compact and lead to high galaxy concentrations despite a modest contribution to the total light . finally , we particularly warn against using uncorrected non - parametric estimators as galaxy classifiers since , understandably , they suffer from severe observational biases and introduce severe errors in the classifications ( see section [ sec : simulations ] ) .",
    "as a first application of our corrected structural measurements , we have studied the variation of concentration in _",
    "satellite _ galaxies of fixed stellar mass ( from paper iii ) with morphological type , and with the three environments detailed in paper i , i.e. , the mass of the host group halo , the projected group - centric distance , and the density of the large - scale structure cosmic web ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we find that the known correlation of satellite concentration with galaxy stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) holds at a fixed morphological type .",
    "specifically , there is a genuine increase in concentration with increasing stellar mass for disk satellite galaxies within each separate bin of bulge - dominated galaxies , intermediate - type and late - type disk morphologies .",
    "the slope of the concentration vs. galaxy stellar mass relationship flattens from the later to the earlier types ( and becomes @xmath301 for satellites with an elliptical morphology , which however cover a limited range in galaxy stellar mass in our sample ) .",
    "it is not trivial to disentangle , in a physically meaningful way , the contributions of an increasing bulge - to - total ratio with increasing mass , and an increasing bulge concentration at fixed bulge - to - total ratio with increasing mass , to the increase in concentration of satellite disk galaxies with increasing stellar mass .",
    "this is true even in our study , in which we did indeed base our morphological classification on the bulge - to - total ratio , and thus bulge - to - total variations within each hubble type should be minimized .",
    "there are nevertheless some residual effects , as the median @xmath100 is found to vary in our sample from @xmath302 at @xmath28 to @xmath303 at @xmath304 for late - type disks , and from 59@xmath27 to 64@xmath27 between @xmath28 and @xmath305 for bulge - dominated disks .",
    "still , for intermediate - type disk satellites , in which the bulge - to - total ratio is tightly constrained by firm lower an upper boundaries by definition , the increase in satellite density with stellar mass can be genuinely ascribed to a @xmath306 decrease in the bulge - to - disk size ratio , i.e. , to a genuine increase in the concentration of the bulge component at fixed bulge - to - total light ratio .",
    "we tentatively assume this as the explanation for the increase of disk satellite concentration with stellar mass at fixed hubble type , an hypothesis which we will test with further analyses .",
    "when considering the galaxies environment , we find that , at galaxy stellar mass @xmath219 and above , @xmath93 bulge - dominated satellites tend to be marginally more concentrated at low lss densities and high group - centric distances , and @xmath95 in contrast , disk - dominated satellites are significantly more concentrated in high group masses .",
    "the interpretation of the first weak trend as a hint for an environmental effect is further hampered , at @xmath294 , by a higher fraction of s0s relative to bulge - dominated spiral galaxies in low @xmath3 relative to high densities ( 60% and 0% , respectively in @xmath307 groups and 58% and 35% over all groups ) and in the outskirts relative to the cores of groups ( 50% and 31% , over all groups ) .",
    "this change in morphological mix at the high - end of the b / t sequence is consistent with other observational works which have also reported an increase in the s0 fraction in the outskirts of groups and clusters , although with no distinction between central and satellite galaxies .",
    "the early study of @xcite on local cluster reveals a drop in the s0 fraction close to the cluster centers , which they interpret as the outcome of disk galaxies destruction happening at the cluster cores .",
    "the more recent analysis of the morphology - density relation at redshift @xmath308 by @xcite shows a depletion of s0 galaxies within 0.3 virial radii , and an increase in the early spirals population at the same distances , consistent with the variation we see in our zens sample . also in @xmath309 groups @xcite",
    "find hints for an excess of s0 galaxies at @xmath310 mpc with respect to the group centers , which instead host a higher fraction of late - type disks .",
    "these authors furthermore find that the fraction of s0 galaxies in groups is comparable to the one in clusters at the same redshift , suggesting that galaxy pre - processing and s0 formation is effective already at these low densities .",
    "the increase of s0 in the outer regions of the groups is particularly interesting , as it counter to the intuitive idea that gas - rich bulge - dominated spirals may become s0 galaxies as they fall deeper into their group potential wells ( see e.g. @xcite who find that gas stripping in the group environment is only effective close to the group centers ) .",
    "speculating on the above , a possible scenario is that @xmath93 bulge - dominated galaxies are transformed into s0s as soon as disk galaxies enter the group potential , and @xmath95 further stellar evolution within the groups replenished the dried - out disks of s0 galaxies of fresh gas , establishing / restoring in them a bulge - dominated morphology .",
    "note that an increase in the fraction of dusty star - forming galaxies at high densities and close to cluster centers has been observed at low redshift , e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evidence of polar and extended hi disks around s0s ",
    "e.g. @xcite  may also support this `` disk - regrowth '' scenario .",
    "the second , statistically more significant trend for @xmath311 disk - dominated galaxies to have a higher concentration in high - mass ( @xmath312 ) than in lower - mass groups appears to be a genuine environmental effect which should suffer from no morphological complications .",
    "@xcite found evidence in their sdss sample that , among galaxies with @xmath313 , satellites are more concentrated than centrals with identical stellar mass .",
    "these authors interpret the variation in concentration within the framework of gradual stripping and subsequent quenching of satellite galaxies during infall into the group potential .",
    "this is also believed to cause a reddening of the satellite galaxies and a shrinking of their typical sizes .",
    "while we postpone an analysis on the subject to a forthcoming paper , here we wish to note that the sdss studies divide the early- and late - type morphological classes on the basis of a non - corrected concentration criterion ( @xmath313 for late - type and @xmath175 for early - type galaxies ) .",
    "comparing their figure 1 with our figure [ fig : c_vs_bt ] , we see that @xmath313 in the sdss system roughly corresponds to a value of @xmath314 in zens , as our concentrations show a small offset due to the corrections we applied .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : cmass ] , a cut at constant concentration sub - divides the zens galaxy sample into two broad bins in which , however , individual hubble types are mixed together below the chosen @xmath4 threshold .",
    "it thus remains an open question whether the difference in concentration between centrals and satellites reported by those authors is the result of a variation in the morphological mix of the central vs. satellite populations , or rather a change in the structure of central and satellite galaxies at a fixed morphological type .",
    "we will address this question in a dedicated zens analysis .",

    "as illustrated in the figure , the agreement between the two sets of measurement is generally good . only about 5% of the galaxies show in zens larger half - light radii and srsic indices than those measured in sdss .",

    "part of the observed discrepancy in the radii is thus likely caused by the different @xmath80 values in the zens and sdss fits . to test this directly , we refitted these galaxies ( including other galaxies which have @xmath351 in zens but @xmath352 in the sdss fits ) imposing a maximum @xmath353 value for the srsic index in their single - component surface brightness fits , as done in the sdss analysis .",

    "these galaxies were found to have substantially larger half - light radii from their single - component fits than from their double - component fits .",
    "this evidence , and a visual inspection of the data and models , motivated our choice to adopt the double - component half - light radii as our fiducial size estimates in zens ( section [ sec : largeradiidiff ] ) .",
    "caution should be exercised in using blindly the gim2d double component results , as a number of factors can produce profiles which do not correspond to a meaningful bulge+disk decomposition ( see also @xcite for an extensive discussion on this issue ) .",
    "for this reason , all residuals images , models and profiles obtained from gim2d were visually inspected to look for possible failure of the fitting algorithm and to identify physically - reasonable double - component models . as in @xcite , we analyze the radial surface brightness profiles of bulges and disks to identify problematic models which would not be recognized as unphysical by simply looking at the fit @xmath354 or at residual images . to this purpose",

    "the fraction of successful bulge+disk decompositions for each morphological class are summarized in table [ tab : gim2drejected ] .",
    "the largest formal failure rate is observed for the late - type disks , as in this case many fits results in a dominating srsic - bulge profile with @xmath170 , as mentioned before .",
    "these are meaningful fits , but not meaningful bulge+disk decompositions ; these systems are considered to be single - component , disk - dominated galaxies . excluding these late - type disks , galaxies which do not have bulge+disk decompositions in either one or both filters sum up to @xmath8620@xmath27 of the s0- to intermediate - type disk sample .        in @xmath366 of galaxies belonging to genuine bulge+disk decompositions ,",

    "a resolved bar is not observed and hence these central structures may either be unresolved bars or truly flattened bulges ( although we ourselves wonder whether such distinction is meaningful , not only from a descriptive but also from a physical perspective ) .",
    "it has been argued that neglecting the bar component when modeling the light profile can affect the best fit parameters and cause an over - estimation of the bulge - to - total ratio of a factor of two to four , and an artificial increase of bulge effective radii ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    to test the importance of such an effect in our sample",
    ", we carried out on those galaxies classified as barred in section [ sec : bars ] a bulge+disk+bar decomposition with the galfit software by modeling the bar with a srsic profile having @xmath368 .",
    "the addition of a third component can introduce further degrees of degeneracy : applying only broad constraints on the bar structural properties resulted in a high fraction of unphysical models .",
    "for this reason we used the results of the isophotal analysis to constrain the bar structural parameters , when available , and to stick to bulge+disk only fits ( without a bar component ) for galaxies without this a priori information . given possible degeneracies between bulge and bar components , when appropriate we will discuss our results with and without those gim2d fits which result in very elongated bulge components .",
    "specifically , for galaxies with an isophotal fits , we used the bar size , ellipticity and position angle measured in section [ sec : bars ] as initial guesses for the fits .",
    "furthermore we imposed the bar half - light radius to be within @xmath369 of the size measured with the method , and at the same time , to be larger than the bulge @xmath64 and smaller than the disk scale - length .",
    "this avoids the inversion of the disk and bar components or fitting a spurious  nuclear \" bar .",
    "likewise , we limited isophotal twists between the bulge and the bar to be within @xmath370 and also imposed a minimum srsic index , @xmath371 , and a maximum ellipticity , @xmath372 , to the bulge .",
    "extensive tests validated the effectiveness of these constraints in leading to reliable fits when the extra degrees of freedom introduced by the bar parameters are allowed in the fits .",
    "the results are presented in the top right panels of figure [ fig : galfit_gim2d ] ( red points ) . consistently with previous work , comparing the gim2d b / t ratios with those obtained from the bulge+disk+bar galfit fits",
    ", we find that the latter tend to be typically smaller , although exceptions are present . only in @xmath7 of the cases the difference is of a factor of @xmath181 or larger .",
    "for most of the galaxies the difference in the final parameters are quite modest , with an average difference of @xmath373 . in several cases ,",
    "fitting also a bar brings the galfit b / t values in better agreement with those derived with gim2d , indicating that the algorithms involved in the derivation of the b / t value in gim2d are less sensitive to the presence of a bar component .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath93 adding the bar component may no doubt be relevant in some analyses of our barred sample , for which we will utilize the bulge+disk+bar decompositions ; @xmath95 the bulge+disk gim2d fits return generally robust descriptions of these galactic subcomponents , and we thus assume these fits as our fiducial two - component description of the galaxy light distributions .",
    "we furthermore tested the general consistency between the parameters obtained with bulge+disk fits performed respectively with galfit and gim2d .",
    "specifically , we ran bulge+disk galfit decompositions on all disk galaxies with available gim2d models ( independent of the availability of the isophotal profiles ) , and compared with each other the best fit parameters obtained with the two independent codes .",
    "this is illustrated in the four panels of figure [ fig : galfit_gim2d ] ( black points ) , for galaxies with reliable galfit and gim2d fits ( see above ) .",
    "the relations shown in the figure are consistent with what we expect from the discussion presented in section [ sec : bulgediskbias ] : the disk scale length is the most robustly determined parameter , with little scatter among the two measurements , whereas the bulge structural properties are subject to the largest discrepancies .",
    "the b / t ratios obtained by the two codes agree on average reasonably well .",
    "the discrepancies observed in b / t in a minority of cases is mostly caused by the differences in the bulge structural parameters .",
    "we note that we found a general tendency to associate low srsic indices ( @xmath170 ) to the bulge component in the galfit fits .",
    "this is particularly true for disk dominated galaxies ( these galaxies have single srsic indices @xmath170 ) for which galfit often converges to a double component solution with @xmath374 but @xmath170 .",
    "such bulges have furthermore elongations and sizes similar to that of the disk . in these cases",
    ", gim2d produces instead a model which is either a pure disk ( @xmath375 ) or very close to it ( @xmath251 ) .",
    "such galfit fits were flagged as not reliable , and are not plotted in figure [ fig : galfit_gim2d ] . in our studies",
    "we will adopt as our fiducial bulge+disk decompositions those derived with gim2d ; we flag however in our catalog individual galaxies with substantially different ( and yet both formally valid ) gim2d and galfit fits , so to be able to test against these uncertainties our results concerning the properties of bulges and disks .      as discussed in section [ sec : gim2dmeasurements ] , reliable srsic fits and bulge+disk decompositions are not available for some galaxies in our sample ( see also appendix [ app : filterbd ] ) .",
    "we inspected whether the galaxies that remained without either or both analytical fits were somehow a biased component of our zens sample ( apart from having on average , as expected , a more complex light distribution ) .",
    "figure [ fig : failedgim2d ] shows the distributions of galaxy masses and @xmath17band half - light radii for such galaxies with no gim2d models .",
    "galaxies without any ( single- and double - component ) size measurements , we use the zest+ radii , _ corrected _ as described in section [ sec : correctionmaps ] . to establish the presence / absence of possible biases , for comparison we also show the global distributions of masses and sizes of galaxies with reliable analytical fits .",
    "a summary of the fraction of failed models for each morphological type is given in table [ tab : gim2drejected ] .",
    "galaxies with no single srsic fits tend to populate the high mass / radius tail of the distributions and their incidence is highest for intermediate - type disks . for these galaxies we will use in our zens analyses the corrected zest+ sizes , which , on the remaining galaxies , we have shown to be in excellent agreement with the ( corrected ) sizes derived from the analytical fits ; only 4% of galaxies are in this category .",
    "we hence reckon that the impact on the final results will be in any case negligible",
    ". although the overall success of the bulge+disk decompositions is lower than the success rate of the single - component fits ( see table [ tab : gim2drejected ] ) , galaxies with no bulge and disk parameters are more uniformly distributed in mass and size relative to the global zens population .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the exclusion of these galaxies from analysis based on bulge / disk parameters will lower the statistical significance of the results , but should not introduce strong biases .",
    "correction maps for sizes and magnitudes , similar to those shown in the main text in section [ sec : simulations ] for the median psf - fwhm of the zens wfi @xmath10 images , are shown here for the two  bracketing \" ",
    "i.e. , the best and the worst ",
    "psf fwhm values our dataset .",
    "a comparison of the corresponding correction maps derived for the three different psf sizes clearly shows the major impact of psf - blurring in the ( uncorrected ) structural measurements .",
    "the implementation of our correction maps rends all measurements comparable onto a consistently calibrated grid .      as commented in section [ sec : simulations ] for the zest+ measurements , there are regions of the observed @xmath4-@xmath38-@xmath142-@xmath64 hyper - plane which are highly degenerate : they can be populated by models with intrinsic parameters which originate in that same region of parameter space , as well as by models with very different  intrinsic \" ellipticity or concentration , which are scattered into that given bin by observational errors .",
    "it is thus important to verify that the size and magnitude corrections that we infer in these regions of parameter space are not strongly dependent on the precise way in which we populate the input grid of simulated models .",
    "if this were the case and without an a priori knowledge of the relative fraction of the two populations in the real universe , the derivation of the corrections in the parameters space would be affected by biases introduced by the precise choice of the simulation grid . to assess whether our correction suffer from this problem",
    ", we calculated the corrections in these  troublesome \" grid points by using only those models with original , intrinsic @xmath182 values in that same bin , and , for comparison , using only models which were originated in a different @xmath182 bin and were scattered into that bin by measurement errors . in many cases we found that both model samples gave consistent results for the corrections to the magnitude and sizes , which we could then use for our real galaxies .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : zestcorrections_withnocontaminers ] for the lowest ellipticity bin , which is also the one with the highest contamination , and for models convolved with the typical @xmath10-band psf .",
    "the corrections derived with the two sub - samples are reassuringly very similar over a wide are of size - magnitude space ( and thus very similar to the global corrections presented in figure [ fig : zestcorrections ] ) .",

    "<S> @xmath5 , the concentration of disk satellites increases with increasing stellar mass , separately within each morphological bin of b / t . </S>",
    "<S> the known increase in concentration with stellar mass for disk satellites is thus due , at least in part , to an increase in galaxy central stellar density at constant b / t . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between concentration and galaxy stellar mass becomes progressively steeper for later morphological types . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of disk satellites shows a barely significant dependence on @xmath3 or @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest environmental effect is found with group mass for @xmath6 disk - dominated satellites , which are @xmath7 more concentrated in high mass groups than in lower mass groups . </S>"
