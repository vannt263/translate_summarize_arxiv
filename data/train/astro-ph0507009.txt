    "ongoing precise doppler surveys by us and european teams are observing about 2000 of the closest and brightest main - sequence stars , and have detected more than 150 jupiter - like extrasolar planets ( marcy 2004 , mayor 2004 ) .",
    "these planets show a wide variety in their masses and orbital characteristics . among them , 25 planets with @xmath3@xmath11 @xmath4  reside in orbits close to the central stars with @xmath12 days .",
    "such short - period giant planets represented by 51 peg b ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) are called `` hot jupiters '' . recently , `` hot neptunes '' with @xmath13 and @xmath12 days have also been found ( butler 2004 , mcarthur 2004 , santos 2004a , vogt 2005 ) .",
    "the very highest doppler precisions , @xmath14 , are capable of detecting planets down to about @xmath15 5 @xmath10  in short period orbits ( vogt 2005 , rivera 2005 ) .",
    "short - period planets have provided deep insights into our understanding of planet formation , interior structure , atmospheres , and orbital evolution of extrasolar planets . in particular , the detection of a hot jupiter transiting hd 209458 ( henry 2000a , charbonneau 2000 ) has provided key information about the planet radius , density , and atmospheric constituents . the quality of this information is due in large part to the intrinsic brightness of the star ( @xmath16 ) which permitted photometric precision of @xmath17 using the hubble space telescope ( brown 2001 , wittenmyer 2005 ) .",
    "atmospheric models predict different radii for planets with and without heavy element cores .",
    "one mystery regarding hd",
    "209458b is that the planet radius is 20% larger than that predicted , even by models without cores .",
    "this observation has fueled controversy regarding the physical cause of the expansion of the radius of hd  209458b .",
    "burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard ( 2003 ) suggest that current theory , including the effects of stellar heating on the atmosphere of the planet but no additional dissipative effects , is consistent with the radius within theoretical and observational error bars .",
    "guillot & showman ( 2002 ) , on the other hand , have calculated that the stellar radiative input of energy generates gas flows from the heated side to the cool side of the synchronously rotating planet .",
    "dissipation of a small fraction of this kinetic energy in the deeper layers of the planet can result in heating and expansion .",
    "however it is not clear why this same mechanism does not inflate the radii of other short - period , transiting planets with very similar properties , such as tres1 ( alonso 2004 ) .",
    "tidal dissipation , driven by ongoing eccentricity damping has also been suggested as a source of internal heating in hd  209458b ( bodenheimer , lin & mardling 2001 , baraffe 2003 , bodenheimer , laughlin & lin 2003 ) .",
    "however , observations of the timing and duration of the secondary eclipse ( deming 2005 ) and the precise radial velocities themselves ( laughlin 2005 ) constrain the orbital eccentricity to be low , @xmath18 , making eccentricity damping an unlikely source of significant internal heat for the planet .",
    "one other source for tidal heating has recently been suggested : tidal dissipation driven by gradual co - planarization between the stellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane of the planet .",
    "a 4misalignment between the stellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane of hd  209458b was determined by modeling the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( winn 2005 ) .",
    "since the timescale for co - planarization exceeds the age of the star , this process could still be driving tidal dissipation in the planet .",
    "it would be useful to measure this effect in host stars of other transiting planets to determine whether spin - orbit misalignment is uniquely associated with hd  209458 .    because short - period planets can substantially advance our understanding of planet structure and atmospheres , the n2k consortium ( fischer 2005a ) was established to carry out a distributed doppler survey of fgk stars ( @xmath19 ) . as telescope time",
    "is allocated , an optimal set of stars is selected and observed over three consecutive nights .",
    "our monte carlo tests show that these three observations will flag hot jupiter candidates with orbital periods between 1.2 and 14 days .",
    "the n2k project draws from a database of @xmath20 stars closer than 100 pc and brighter than @xmath21 .",
    "metallicities for all stars in the database were established using a broadband color calibration ( ammons 2005 ) .",
    "low resolution spectroscopic follow - up ( robinson 2005 ) was obtained for stars with high metallicity estimates .",
    "high metallicity stars are preferred for this program because of the well - established planet - metallicity correlation ( gonzalez 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , gonzalez 2001 , fuhrmann 1997 , 1998 , santos 2001 , 2003 , 2004b , reid 2002 ) which shows that stars with [ fe / h]@xmath22 have more than three times as many gas giant planets ( fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "ida and lin ( 2004 ) propose that the planet - metallicity correlation is quantitatively accounted for by a core accretion scenario for formation of gas giant planets .",
    "their models also predict the presence of hot neptunes , albeit only around metal - rich stars .",
    "the n2k consortium has screened @xmath23 stars in the past 10 months using the keck , magellan and subaru telescopes .",
    "three non - transiting close - in gas giant planets have been detected ( hd  88133 , fischer 2005a ; hd  149143 , hd  109749 , fischer 2005b ) and follow - up observations are being made for about 40 additional planet candidates . in this paper , we report on the first detection flagged with subaru observations : a `` hot saturn '' that has been observed to transit the g0 iv star hd  149026 .",
    "the subaru component of the n2k survey employs the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope ( noguchi 2002 ) . to provide a fiducial wavelength reference for precise radial velocity ( rv ) measurements",
    ", we use an iodine absorption cell , which is installed just behind the entrance slit of the spectrograph ( kambe 2002 ; sato 2002 ) .",
    "we adopt the setup of stdi2b which simultaneously covers a wavelength region of 35006100   by a mosaic of two ccds and the slit width of 0@xmath24.8 giving a reciprocal resolution ( @xmath25 ) of 55000 . using this setup",
    ", we can obtain signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath26 pixel@xmath27 at 5500   for our typical science targets , @xmath28 stars , for an exposure time of about 60 seconds . such s / n and wavelength resolution enable us to achieve a doppler precision of 45 .",
    "the set of n2k runs at subaru were carried out on july 1921 and august 23 in 2004 .",
    "the first 3 nights were devoted to identify stars showing short - period rv variations consistent with a hot jupiter , and the 4th night was for follow - up observation to eliminate spectroscopic binaries and to extend the observational baseline for previously observed stars . on the first observation , we checked for emission in the ca h&k lines , and analyzed all spectra with a spectral synthesis modeling pipeline to determine metallicity , ,  and @xmath5  with uncertainties of 0.05 dex , 40k , 0.05 dex and 0.5  respectively , as discussed in valenti & fischer ( 2005 ) .",
    "spectral modeling also flags double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) by virtue of an extremely poor @xmath29  fit to the observation .",
    "visual inspection of the poorly - modeled spectra then confirmed the presence of a second set of spectral lines .",
    "as a result of this screening , 9 of 125 stars were identified as sb2s or rapid rotators and were dropped before a second observation was obtained .",
    "all information regarding every star observed , including rv measurements , information from spectral synthesis modeling , information about the presence of stellar companions and chromospheric activity measurements will appear in an n2k catalog ( fischer 2005c ) .    during",
    "the subaru runs described above , we obtained 34 doppler measurements for 116 stars .",
    "typical instrumental precision of the radial velocities is found to be 34 with the standard doppler pipeline developed by butler ( 1996 ) . with this doppler precision ,",
    "stars displaying rms scatter between 2050  are likely planet candidates .",
    "hd  149026 was one of six stars that showed an interesting initial rms scatter ( 37 over 3 nights in july 2004 ) .",
    "subsequent observations at keck in february and april 2005 confirmed a planetary orbit and provided ephemeris times for photometric follow - up .",
    "hd 149026 is a g0 iv star with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath32  parallax ( esa 1997 ) of @xmath33 places the star at a distance of 78.9 pc with an absolute visual magnitude , @xmath34 . our spectroscopic analysis yields @xmath35 k , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath5@xmath38 .",
    "the metallicity prediction from the broadband calibration of ammons ( 2005 ) was @xmath39 , matching the spectroscopic analysis . from the bolometric luminosity and our spectroscopic",
    ", we derive a stellar radius of @xmath40 .",
    "the girardi and yale evolutionary tracks ( demarque 2004 , girardi 2000 ) provided identical stellar mass estimates of @xmath1 . although the calibration to measure chromospheric activity has not yet been completed for the hds spectra , no emission was observed in the cores of the ca h&k lines relative to the nso solar spectrum ( wallace 1993 ) shown in figure 1 .",
    "the known stellar parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the observation dates , radial velocities and instrumental uncertainties for hd  149026 are listed in table 2 .",
    "the first four observations were made at subaru ; an offset of @xmath415.4  was applied to the subaru radial velocities in order to minimize @xmath29  when fitting a keplerian model to the combined subaru and keck velocities .",
    "amazingly , 4 of 7 keck radial velocities were serendipitously obtained in transit .",
    "since the transit window is 3 hours long and the orbital period is 2.88 days , there is only a @xmath42 probability that a randomly chosen observation time will occur during transit .",
    "the probability of making subsequent in - transit observations is not an independent draw , however , since stars are normally observed near the meridian . because the orbital period is close to three days , observations obtained on three consecutive nights have an enhanced probability of catching two points in transit .",
    "furthermore , two of our in - transit observations were made about an hour apart during a single transit .",
    "our best fit orbital parameters are listed in table 3 and the keplerian fit is overplotted on the phased radial velocity data in figure 2 .",
    "the filled circles represent subaru rv measurements and the open diamonds represent keck data .",
    "the four keck rv s serendipitously taken during transit were removed for purposes of fitting the keplerian model and are overplotted as triangles on figure 2 . by fitting to the radial velocity data ,",
    "we obtain a period of @xmath43 day . with a fixed circular orbit",
    "we measure a velocity amplitude of 43.3 .",
    "the rms rv scatter to this fit is 3.8 and @xmath29= 1.22 .",
    "uncertainties in the orbital parameters were estimated by running a bootstrap monte carlo with 100 trials . with the stellar mass of 1.3 , we derive @xmath3= 0.36 @xmath4 , and @xmath44 au .",
    "the four radial velocities of hd  149026 obtained during transit exhibit the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect , a deviation from keplerian velocities which occurs because a transiting planet occults first the approaching limb of the rotating star and then the receding limb of the star . if the orbital plane is coplanar with the stellar equatorial plane , then a symmetrical deviation occurs about mid - transit .",
    "the observation of this effect in the doppler velocities provides an unambiguous and independent confirmation of the photometric planet transit .",
    "the amplitude of this effect in hd  149026 can be estimated by scaling the effect in hd  209458 which we estimate at @xmath45 .",
    "the photometric transit depth is only 0.003 mag in hd  149026 , compared to 0.019 mag in hd  209458 , however the rotational velocity is somewhat higher ( 6  compared to 4 ) .",
    "so , we expect a maximum rm amplitude of about @xmath46 , consistent with our four in - transit observations . if the radius of hd  149026b were similar to hd  209458b , the departure from a keplerian model would have precluded a quick detection .",
    "asymmetry in the rm velocities arises from non - coplanar orientations between the stellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane .",
    "while the in - transit rvs plotted in figure 2 seem to show an asymmetry , fits that include the constraints provided by photometry indicate that this asymmetry is only marginally significant .",
    "the stellar radius is a critical parameter since only the ratio of the planet radius to the stellar radius is well - determined by the transit depth .",
    "we determine the stellar radius from the @xmath32-based stellar luminosity , @xmath47 , and our spectroscopically - derived , @xmath48k :    @xmath49    uncertainty in the stellar radius is dominated by the uncertainty in the stellar luminosity .",
    "the limiting factor for precision of the stellar luminosity is the @xmath32  parallax precision of 1 @xmath50 .",
    "higher precision astrometry for hd  149026 could substantially improve the precision in the stellar radius .",
    "for example , the space interferometry mission ( sim ) should achieve better than 10 microarcsecond single measurement precision ( shao 2004 ) , significantly reducing the uncertainty in the stellar luminosity and improving the measurements of stellar and transiting planet radii by a factor of six .",
    "we began photometric observations of hd  149026 with the t11 0.8 m automatic photometric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory after the star was recognized as a short - period radial velocity variable .",
    "precision photometric measurements are an important complement to doppler observations and can help to establish whether the radial velocity variations are caused by stellar magnetic activity or planetary - reflex motion ( henry 2000b ) .",
    "for example , queloz ( 2001 ) and paulson ( 2004 ) have shown that photospheric features were the source of periodic radial velocity variations in the young g0  v star hd  166435 and in several hyades dwarfs .",
    "in addition , photometric observations can detect possible transits of the planetary companions and so allow the determination of their radii and true masses ( e.g. , henry 2000a ) .",
    "the t11 apt is equipped with a two - channel precision photometer employing two emi 9124qb bi - alkali photomultiplier tubes to make simultaneous measurements in the strmgren @xmath51 and @xmath52 passbands .",
    "this telescope and its photometer are essentially identical to the t8 0.8 m apt and photometer described in henry ( 1999 ) .",
    "the apt measures the difference in brightness between a program star and a nearby constant comparison star with a typical precision of 0.0015 mag for bright stars ( @xmath53 ) . for hd  149026 , we used hd  149504 ( @xmath54 = 6.59 , @xmath55 = 0.44 , f5 ) as our primary comparison star , which was shown to be constant to 0.002 mag or better by comparison with two additional comparison stars ( hd  146135 , @xmath54 = 7.08 , @xmath55 = 0.36 , f2 ; hd  151087 , @xmath54 = 6.02 , @xmath55 = 0.32 , f2.5  iii - iv ) .",
    "we reduced our strmgren @xmath51 and @xmath52 differential magnitudes with nightly extinction coefficients and transformed them to the strmgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients .",
    "further information on the telescope , photometer , observing procedures , and data reduction techniques employed with the t11 apt can be found in henry ( 1999 ) and eaton ( 2003 ) .",
    "a typical observation with the apt , termed a group observation , consists of several measurements of the program star , each of which are bracketed by measurements of a comparison star or stars .",
    "the group observations typically take 5 to 15 minutes to complete , depending on the number of comparison stars in the group and the integration times for each star .",
    "the individual differential magnitudes determined within each group are then averaged to create group means , which are usually treated as single observations . on most nights ,",
    "our observations of hd  149026 were obtained and reduced in this manner , resulting in a total of 153 group mean differential observations between 2005 april 25 and june 15 ut .    however , on the nights of 2005 may 14 ut ( jd 2453504 ) and june 6 ut ( jd 2453527 ) , we monitored hd  149026 and its primary comparison star repeatedly for approximately 7.5 hours around the time of conjunction predicted by the radial velocity observations and obtained 300 individual differential measures on each night .",
    "rather than averaging the resulting individual differential magnitudes within each group on these monitoring nights , we have retained the individual observations to increase the time resolution of our brightness measurements to about 90 sec during the transit search .",
    "a few of the monitoring observations from each night were discarded as isolated outliers , resulting from such factors as telescope vibration , poor centering , or moments of poor seeing .",
    "additional _ simultaneous _ monitoring observations were acquired on the night of 2005 june 9 ut ( jd 2453530 ) with the t8 , t10 , and t11 apts ; 330 differential observations were obtained with each telescope .",
    "the t8 and t10 apts are functionally identical to the t11 apt ( henry 1999 ; eaton 2003 ) .",
    "these june 9 observations from the three apts were averaged together into a single data stream , and a couple of isolated outliers were discarded . to increase the precision of _ all _ of our total of 973 differential magnitudes , we averaged the strmgren @xmath51 and @xmath52 magnitudes into a single @xmath56 passband .",
    "the resulting 973 @xmath56 differential magnitudes are listed in table  4 .    all except for",
    "a few of our 153 group mean @xmath56 differential magnitudes fall outside of the transit window predicted from the radial velocity observations .",
    "the standard deviation of these out - of - transit observations is 0.0015 mag , indicating that both hd  149026 and its comparison star are constant to the limit of precision of the apts . a least - squares sine fit of those observations phased to the radial velocity period gives an upper limit to the semiamplitude of any light variability on that period of only 0.0004 @xmath57 0.0002 mag .",
    "thus , starspots are unlikely to be the cause of the velocity periodicity in hd  149026 .",
    "a few of the group mean observations , acquired just before dawn on the night of 2005 may 11 ut ( jd 2453501 ) , fall within the early part of the transit window and suggest a slight dimming of around 0.003 mag .",
    "this was our first indication of possible transits in hd  149026 .",
    "the geometric probability of transits in this system is approximately 15% , computed from equation ( 1 ) of seagroves ( 2003 ) .",
    "our three nights of monitoring observations around the predicted times of conjunction are plotted in figure  3 .",
    "the observations on all three nights confirm shallow transits in hd  149026 .",
    "the strmgren @xmath56 differential magnitudes have been converted to linear intensity units relative to the mean out - of - transit light level measured on each night .",
    "the monitoring observations have been phased with the 2.8766-day orbital period and the times of mid - transit determined for each event .",
    "the transits occurred approximately 0.05 days or 1.2 hours earlier than predicted from the spectroscopic orbital solution but within the limits of its uncertainty window .",
    "the observed duration of the transits is just over 0.04 phase units or approximately 3 hours , while the observed depth is only 0.003 mag , significantly less than the 0.007 mag events we were expecting from the stellar radius of 1.45 ( table  1 ) and an anticipated planetary radius of 1.14 @xmath8 , corresponding a gas giant planet with no core ( see  5 , below ) .",
    "we modeled the three sets of transit observations separately with the eclipsing binary lightcurve synthesis software of bradstreet & steelman ( 2002 ) to determine the planetary radius and orbital inclination as well as the times of mid transit .",
    "the stellar mass , radius , and effective temperature , along with the planetary mass , orbital period , and eccentricity , were fixed at the values given in tables 1 and 3 , respectively . a linear limb darkening coefficient of 0.61 was used ( van hamme 1993 ) , appropriate for the stellar @xmath58 and @xmath59 values from table 1 and the stromgren @xmath56 bandpass of the observations .",
    "no attempt was made to model the @xmath51 and @xmath52 lightcurves separately since no color change was detectable during the transit and also because the light curves in the individual bandpasses exhibited more scatter .",
    "our best - fit time of mid - transit , planetary radius , and orbital inclination , as well as the rms of each solution , are listed in table  5 .",
    "the weighted means of the planetary radius and the inclination are @xmath7 @xmath8  and @xmath60 , respectively , where the third solution was given twice the weight of the others because of its significantly smaller rms scatter and the radius is relative to jupiter s equatorial radius , @xmath8  = @xmath61 cm .",
    "the error bars include the effects of the uncertainties in the assumed parameters , the most significant of which is the uncertainty in the stellar radius .",
    "our best - fit models for each transit are shown by the solid curves in the three panels of figure  3 .",
    "the best - fit model of the third transit , which has the most precise observations , is shown pictorially in figure  4 .",
    "the ratio of the stellar to planetary radius is approximately @xmath62 , resulting in the observed shallow transits of only @xmath63 mag .",
    "because of the relatively large stellar radius and the short planetary orbital period , transits would occur for inclinations down to a limit of about 81 , where the center of the planet would just graze the stellar limb . however , grazing or near - grazing events result in much poorer fits to the photometric observations , as shown in the top panel of figure  5 , where we have plotted the reduced @xmath64 of the best - fit model of the third transit for a range of assumed inclinations from 81to 90 .",
    "as shown in the bottom panel of figure  5 , the best - fit planetary radius must increase as the inclination decreases , to compensate for crossing the star farther and farther from the center of the stellar disk .",
    "as the transits become partial below about 82 , the planetary radius must increase dramatically to maintain the observed transit depth .",
    "however , the transit _",
    "duration _ for these grazing or near - grazing transits becomes much shorter than the observed duration of the transit , resulting in the much higher reduced @xmath64 values for the best fits seen in the top panel of figure  5 .",
    "thus , the observations are clearly incompatible with grazing or near - grazing transits of a larger planet .",
    "both the mass and the radius of hd 149026 are considerably smaller than those of the other known transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "having estimated the planetary radius , @xmath65 and mass , @xmath66 by fitting the radial velocity and transit photometry data , we are in a position to compare the results with theoretical evolutionary models . to do this , we use the results of bodenheimer ( 2003 ) , who computed sequences of models for isolated planets ranging in mass from 0.11 @xmath4 to 3.0 @xmath4 .",
    "separate sequences were computed for models that contained and did not contain solid , constant density ( @xmath67 ) cores . adopting the stellar and orbital parameters listed in tables 1 and 3 , and assuming a bond albedo @xmath68",
    ", we estimate an effective temperature for the planet of @xmath69 .",
    "this value is uncertain to 10% because the albedo is not known .",
    "the planet falls on the borderline between sudarsky , burrows , & pinto s ( 2000 ) class iv ( typical albedo 0.03 ) and class v ( typical albedo 0.55 ) .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty in the theoretical radius is roughly 5% . under these conditions ,",
    "the models of bodenheimer ( 2003 ) predict a planetary radius of @xmath70 for an object of purely solar composition , and @xmath71 for a planet with a @xmath72 constant density ( @xmath73 ) core . clearly , in order to explain the radius of hd 149026b , a substantial enrichment in heavy elements above solar composition is required .",
    "the mean density of the planet , 1.17 g @xmath74 , is 1.7 times that of saturn , which itself has roughly 25% heavy elements by mass . on the other hand , the planet",
    "is not composed entirely of water ice or olivine , or else the radius would be 0.43 or 0.28 @xmath8 , respectively ( guillot 1996 , guillot 2005 ) .",
    "we have therefore computed new sequences of contracting and cooling planetary models of mass 0.36 @xmath4with the code described in bodenheimer et al ( 2003 ) , under the assumption that that planet is made up of a core of uniform density composed entirely of elements heavier than helium , and an envelope composed primarily of fluid with solar composition .",
    "it is of course possible that some of the heavy elements are not in the core but are dissolved in the envelope ; however the effects on the computed mean density will be similar ( guillot 2005 ) .",
    "the calculations were started at a radius of 23 times the present value and were run up to an age of 2 gyr , the estimated age of hd 149026 .",
    "the planet is heated at the surface to 1500 k during the entire evolution .",
    "the surface boundary conditions are those for a gray radiative photosphere with a rosseland mean opacity .",
    "the deduced radii are therefore approximate but nevertheless in reasonable agreement with more detailed calculations with non - gray photospheres ( chabrier & baraffe 2000 , burrows 2003 , burrows 2004 , chabrier 2004 ) .",
    "the envelope opacities in the outer radiative zone are purely molecular ( r. freedman 2003 , private communication ) and do not take into account the possible effects of clouds .",
    "the equation of state in the envelope is calculated from the tables of saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) .",
    "the results are surprising . assuming a core density @xmath75 , the estimated mean core density of saturn ( marley 1999 )",
    ", we find for ( @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ) a solid core mass of @xmath78 . if @xmath79 , the required core mass rises to 78 @xmath10 .",
    "for these two assumed core densities , which probably bracket the actual mean core density that would be obtained with a more detailed compressible equation of state for the core , the results for the derived core mass as a function of observed radius are given in table 6 for a mass of 0.36 m@xmath80 . the interpolated core mass lies between entries ( a ) and ( b ) in table 6 for @xmath81 , and between entries ( c ) and ( d ) for @xmath82 .",
    "for both cases of assumed central density , the core comprises the majority of the planetary mass , indicating that despite its mass and orbital period , the planet is qualitatively more similar in structure to neptune than it is to saturn or jupiter .",
    "furthermore , the conclusion that the core is large seems secure . even if the observed radius is increased by 2 sigma to 0.825 @xmath8 , the core mass turns out to be 50.5 @xmath10 in the case of @xmath83=10.5 and 58.7 @xmath10 in the case of @xmath83=5.5 g @xmath74 .",
    "note that the radii computed here do not include an effect pointed out by burrows et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , namely that the radius deduced from observations of a transit is larger by about 10% ( for hd 209458b ) than the theoretical `` photospheric '' radius because of the oblique viewing angle . for the lower - mass planet hd 149026b this effect could be even larger .",
    "if the planet radius is actually smaller than 0.7 @xmath8 , then clearly the required enhancement of heavy elements would be even larger than quoted here .",
    "the n2k consortium was established to survey `` the next 2000 '' closest and brightest high metallicity stars . here",
    "we describe a transiting saturn - mass planet from the n2k consortium with an orbital period of 2.8766 days orbiting the @xmath30 star , hd  149026 .",
    "the planet was initially identified with doppler observations from subaru and confirmed with keck observations .",
    "remarkably , hd  149026 only dims by 0.003 mag during the three hour transit of the planet .",
    "the photometric transit depth , together with the stellar radius of 1.45  provides a planet radius of only 0.725 @xmath8 .",
    "four of seven keck radial velocities were serendipitously obtained during transit .",
    "these four radial velocities exhibit the rossiter - mclaughlin effect and provide an independent confirmation of the planetary transit .    with a radius of only 0.725 @xmath8",
    ", hd  149026b seems anomalously small and emphasizes the diversity of extrasolar planet characteristics .",
    "indeed , two of the three transits around bright stars ( hd  209458 , tres1 and hd  149026 ) are `` anomalous . ''",
    "hd 209458 is too big , hd 149026 is too small ; only tres1 conformed to prior expectations .",
    "these anomalies indicate a wider - than - expected diversity of planetary types , and may also point to the need for models that include a wider variety of physical and atmospheric phenomena .",
    "the small photometric depth of the transit underscores the most novel property of hd 149026b  its large core .",
    "the apparent presence of the large core has a number of potentially interesting ramifications for the theory of planet formation .",
    "first , it would be difficult to form this giant planet by the gravitational instability mechanism ( boss 2004 ) , and by corollary , it likely illustrates a dramatic outcome of the core - accretion scenario ( e.g. hubickyj 2004 , and references therein ) . among the giant planets in our solar system ,",
    "neptune is the hardest to account for within the framework of gravitational instability . in that picture ,",
    "neptune began as a @xmath84 jeans - unstable fragment .",
    "as the massive , cool proto - neptune underwent kelvin - helmholtz contraction , its burden of solid grains settled to the central regions to form a core .",
    "as this was occurring , it is suggested ( boss 2003 ) that a nearby massive star photoevaporated the outer layers , leaving , at the end of the day , a 17 @xmath10 remnant of heavy elements , if a solar - composition is assumed .    in order for this scenario to work for hd 149026b , the initial twice - solar metallicity fragment would need to have a total mass of order 6 @xmath4 in order to give rise to a 67 @xmath10 core , which is a total mass of solid components in the fragment .",
    "for such a large protoplanet , the settling time for the solid grains is considerably longer than the kelvin - helmholtz contraction time for the envelope .",
    "furthermore , near - complete photo - evaporation of a @xmath85 protoplanet is difficult to accomplish .",
    "however , the large core of hd 149026b also presents difficulties for conventional models of core accretion . in the core - accretion theory , which was developed in the context of the minimum - mass solar nebula , it is difficult to prevent runaway gas accretion from occurring onto cores more massive than 30 @xmath10 , even if abundant infalling planetesimals are heating the envelope and delaying the kelvin - helmholtz contraction that is required to let more gas into the planet s hill sphere .",
    "the current structure of hd 149026b suggests that it was formed in a gas - starved environment , yet presumably enough gas was present in the protoplanetary disk to drive migration from its probable formation region beyond one or two au from the star inward to the current 2.87 day orbit .",
    "we note , however , that the buildup of the large core mass was aided by the high metallicity @xmath86 of the protoplanetary gas . in the standard theory , the isolation mass of a protostellar core scales as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the surface density of solids in the disk and @xmath89 is the distance from the star , which has mass @xmath90 .",
    "we assume that @xmath88 scales as @xmath91 .",
    "the final core mass , after further accretion of gas and solids , is about @xmath92 ( pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) . for a twice - solar metallicity disk around a 1.3 @xmath93 star ,",
    "this implies a factor of 3.7 increase in @xmath94 and @xmath95 as compared to their values in the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "but at least a factor of 3 increase in @xmath88 above that in the minimum mass solar nebula is required for the core accretion model to produce solar system giant planets in a time comparable to the lifetime of protoplanetary disks . as an example we use the result of hubickyj et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the formation of jupiter at 5.2 au around the sun with @xmath96 g @xmath97 .",
    "they obtain @xmath98 and @xmath99 . scaling from that result , a plausible @xmath95 for hd 149026b forming at 5.2",
    "au is close to 60 @xmath100 .",
    "even if no further accretion of solids occurs after the isolation mass is reached , @xmath95 would be 42 @xmath100 .",
    "planet formation models with shorter accretion timescales may be key to understanding the formation of hd  149026b ( c.f .",
    ", aliberti 2005 ) .",
    "several scenarios for forming an saturn - mass object with a @xmath101 core can be envisioned .",
    "the planet may have migrated inward when it was less massive than present , and became stranded at the 2:1 resonance with the so - called x - point of the protostellar disk ( e.g. shu 1994 , see also the suggestion in lin , bodenheimer , & richardson 1996 ) .",
    "after the planetary core was stranded , gas migrating through the disk would climb the magnetic field lines onto the star , whereas planetesimals would cross through the x - point and be pushed further inward by the disk torque .",
    "some of these planetesimals would accrete onto the stranded planet , increasing its compositional fraction of heavy elements ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "alternately , a planet with a large core could be formed through a giant impact scenario between two isolation - mass embryos .",
    "such an object could then either migrate inward via conventional type ii migration , or perhaps have been scattered into a highly eccentric orbit by interactions with other planets in the system . in the case of a scattering history , the orbital plane of the planet was likely to have been initially misaligned with the spin axis of the star . this scenario may soon find support as more in - transit rvs which exhibit the rossiter - mclaughlin effect on the stellar lines are obtained ( e.g. winn et al 2005 ) .",
    "there were two necessary components for this transit detection .",
    "first , the initial doppler reconnaissance at subaru and keck detected the low - mass , short - period planet and provided accurate transit predictions .",
    "second , the robotic telescopes at fairborn observatory were available to obtain baseline photometry and to carry out millimag - precision photometric observations at the predicted transit times .",
    "this approach , combining a quick - look , doppler survey with targeted high - precision photometry has turned out to be an efficient way to detect transiting planets around bright stars ; both hd  209458 and hd  149026 were discovered with this strategy .    the small radius of this transiting planet bears upon the expected detection rate by widefield photometric transit surveys of bright stars .",
    "such a small transit depth would likely be missed with the typical photometric precision of 0.01 mag .",
    "another factor that may negatively impact detection rates for wide field transit surveys is the malmquist bias . because of this effect",
    ", subgiants are preferentially included in magnitude - limited samples .",
    "the larger stellar radii of these stars reduces the transit depth and demands millimag observational precision .",
    "of the four stars with short - period planets detected in the n2k program , all have somewhat extended radii .",
    "hd  88133 has a radius of 1.93  and a planet mass , @xmath3= 0.25 @xmath4 ; hd  149143 has a radius of 1.49  and a planet mass of 1.32 @xmath4 ; hd  109749 has a stellar radius of 1.24  and a planet mass of 0.27 @xmath4 , and hd  149026 has a radius of 1.45  and a planet mass of 0.36 @xmath4 . while , the transit probabilities for all four of these detections exceed the canonical 10% transit probability because of the distended stellar radii , the predicted transit depths are only a fraction of the transit depth observed for hd  209458 .    at one time",
    ", photometric surveys were predicted to detect hundreds of transiting planets per month ( horne 2003 ) .",
    "instead , transit detection has turned out to be harder than anticipated , perhaps because the high - precision regime is technically difficult for any technique and because the diversity of planet characteristics continues to surprise us .",
    "the combination of the doppler technique , which is sensitive to the gravitational effect of the planet , and targeted high - precision photometry provide complementary information that dramatically increases our understanding of extrasolar planets .",
