    "on the other hand , the kondo model ( or _ sd _ model ) is also used to address spin interactions between the impurity spin and the spins of the dirac fermions in graphene .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the kondo effect for a magnetic adatom on graphene using the anderson model . upon obtaining the green s function of the impurity to higher order contributions in the hybridization </S>",
    "<S> , we calculated analytically the selfenergy in the presence of strong correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the kondo resonance takes place in a narrow energy range of the impurity level around the fermi energy which can be tuned by a gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this range is linear in the fermi energy @xmath0 and is significantly narrower than in the case for a normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this behavior is traced back to the inherent properties of graphene , especially its linear dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity in the full green s function is also analyzed with the help of a transparent geometrical method . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between the various selfenergies and the implications for the experimental observations are discussed . </S>"
