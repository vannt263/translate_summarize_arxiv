    "determination of fundamental stellar properties is required in many sub - fields of astrophysics . in this regard ,",
    "the promise of asteroseismology is very important , in particular for solar - like oscillating stars .",
    "most of the oscillations , at least for main - sequence ( ms ) stars , are acoustic pressure waves and their frequencies depend on sound speed throughout stellar interior .",
    "sound speed , however , depends on the first adiabatic exponent @xmath5 , which is very low in the he ii ionization zone .",
    "the he ii ionization zone of the solar - like oscillating stars is not too shallow , and its upper and lower borders coincide with the nodes of certain modes .",
    "it has so significant effect on the oscillation frequencies that one can infer basic properties of such stars from these frequencies .",
    "the present study develops new methods for this purpose .",
    "solar - like oscillating stars have such regular oscillation frequencies ( @xmath6 ) that the frequency of a mode linearly depends on its order @xmath7 and degree @xmath8 .",
    "this dependence is known as the asymptotic relation . according to this idea ,",
    "the frequencies of modes with adjacent orders and the same @xmath8 are evenly spaced by the so - called large separation , @xmath9 . in reality , however , there are some deviations from this simple relation , and these variations lead us to discover parameters related to stellar structure and evolution . for this purpose ,",
    "yildiz et al . (",
    "2014 ; hereafter paper i ) introduce two new reference frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are the frequencies at which the large separations between the oscillation frequencies are minimum . in paper",
    "i , new expressions for fundamental stellar properties , such as stellar mass ( @xmath12 ) , radius ( @xmath13 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath14 ) , luminosity ( @xmath15 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath16 ) and age ( @xmath17 ) , are derived from the interior models of 0.8 - 1.3 m_@xmath18  with solar composition . the present study aims to generalize these expressions for the wider mass range ( @xmath19-@xmath20 m_@xmath18  ) than this range and to test the effects of the metallicity ( @xmath0 ) and helium abundance ( @xmath1 ) on these relations .",
    "we also try to determine @xmath1 and @xmath0 from the oscillation frequencies , at least for interior models .",
    "the frequencies of ms models are used in deriving expressions for age and other quantities . for sub - giants and giants ,",
    "these relations must be tested .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we make general considerations about the reference frequencies .",
    "section 3 is devoted to generalizing the relations obtained in paper i for wider mass range and arbitrary metallicity and helium abundance .",
    "we present the sensitivity of the adiabatic oscillation frequencies to the metallicity and helium abundance , and new methods for determination of @xmath1 and @xmath0 from oscillation frequencies in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the asteroseismic parameters that can be extracted from oscillation frequencies and related to the stellar parameters are , the frequency of the maximum amplitude ( ) , and small separation between the oscillation frequencies ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "brown et al . ( 1991 ) give @xmath22as ( see also kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ) @xmath23 in addition to these parameters , we introduce @xmath24 and @xmath25 . their ratio to @xmath22gives us the stellar mass : @xmath26 where the numeric values 1.188 and 1.623 come from the ratio @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . if we insert equation ( 2 ) in equation ( 1 ) , expression for @xmath29 and @xmath30 in terms of fundamental stellar parameters is derived as @xmath31 equation ( 3 ) is valid at least for the models with solar values and mass ranging from 0.8 m_@xmath18  to 1.3 m_@xmath18  presented in paper i.    stellar parameters change with chemical composition .",
    "therefore , one can expect that @xmath32 is also a sensitive function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and thus equation ( 1 ) will need to be modified to take these effects into account .",
    "for the relations derived in paper i , it is also important to understand how the other asteroseismic quantities are influenced by change in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "inference of the solar helium surface abundance ( @xmath33 ) from high degree ( @xmath34 ) oscillation frequencies of the sun is the subject of many studies .",
    "basu & antia ( 1995 ) , for example , give @xmath33 as @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , high degree oscillations are not observable for other stars .",
    "houdek & gough ( 2007 ) confirm that the amplitude of the second difference of the frequencies depends on the helium abundance .",
    "recently , verma et al . (",
    "2014 ) find helium abundances from @xmath36 data for 16 cyg a and b. in paper i , we have used the frequencies at which @xmath37 is minimum for determination of stellar parameters . in the present study , however , we use the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath38 for determination of helium abundance ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "a similar approach may also lead us to develop a new method for inference of metallicity from oscillation frequencies .",
    "in this study , as in paper i , the stellar interior models with solar chemical composition are constructed by using the anki code ( ezer & cameron 1965 ; yildiz 2011 ) .",
    "the solar chemical composition is taken as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the adiabatic oscillation frequencies of these models are computed by adipls ( christensen - dalsgaard 2008 ) . in this section ,",
    "we test if the relations derived in paper i are also valid for @xmath42 m_@xmath18  @xmath43 m_@xmath18  and arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ".    both of the minima do not appear in all the models within the mass range we deal with .",
    "for example , the second minimum is not seen in the oscillation frequencies of the models with @xmath44 m_@xmath18  ( see table 1 of paper i ) while the first minima disappears in some models within the upper mass range of 1.3 - 1.6 m_@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , our present analysis is based on the frequency of the second minimum of the models with mass range 1.0 - 1.6 m_@xmath18 .      in paper i ,",
    "the expressions for stellar mass in terms of @xmath37 and one of @xmath24 or @xmath25 are derived from the interior models for the mass range 0.8 - 1.3 m_@xmath18 . for the sun ,",

    ", we obtain a relation between mass and the frequency ratio @xmath25/  for the range @xmath58-@xmath20 m_@xmath18  of @xmath59 we note that the mass still is found from the same frequency ratio @xmath60 .",
    "the reason for the deviation of mass from the expression given in equation 10 of paper i is due to change in properties of @xmath25 for relatively higher masses . in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 of models are plotted with respect to model mass .",
    "@xmath37 gradually decreases from 2600 to 1000 @xmath37 as model mass increases .",

    "metallicity also affects stellar structure and evolution significantly , and consequently affects oscillation frequencies .",
    "the derived relations are in general different for different @xmath0 .",
    "we develop new relations valid for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "the relation between , @xmath0 and @xmath86 ( equation 12 ) is in particular very useful and can be employed to determine of any of these quantities .",
    "we also obtain a similar relation for @xmath91 ( equation 13 ) .",
    "the relations between asteroseismic and non - asteroseismic quantities are in general less sensitive to helium abundance in comparison with metallicity .",
    "however , the relation for mass is significantly changed by @xmath1 .",
    "we find that estimated mass is inversely proportional to @xmath155 ( equation 15 ) .",
    "we also develop new methods for determination of @xmath1 and @xmath0 from oscillation frequencies .",
    "we plot @xmath156 with respect to @xmath7 for interior models with the same input parameters but @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "these methods are based on the amplitudes in such diagrams .",
    "usefulness of these methods will be clear when they are applied to the @xmath36 and @xmath137 targets .",
    "the difference between model and estimated @xmath0 ( equation 18 ) values is about 14 per cent at most .",
    "this difference is about 10 per cent for @xmath1 .",
