    "experimental and theoretical studies of rapid granular flows @xcite have hitherto mostly focused on assemblies of identical particles , either freely cooling when the energy loss due to inter - particle collisions is not compensated for , or driven in a non - equilibrium stationary state by various energy injection mechanisms .",
    "recently however , interest has grown for the more complicated case of polydisperse systems @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations into the homogeneous cooling stage of a binary mixture @xcite have shown that the two components have different granular temperatures ( i.e. kinetic energies ) , even if their cooling rates are equal .",
    "such a result , confirmed by detailed monte carlo simulations @xcite is also obtained when the system is sheared @xcite , heated by the contact with an elastic granular gas maintained at fixed temperature @xmath0 @xcite , or within the maxwell model framework @xcite .",
    "similarly , a tracer particle undergoing inelastic collisions with an equilibrium fluid at temperature @xmath0 reaches a granular temperature lower than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this violation of equipartition in a mixture , although in sharp contrast with the behaviour of molecular gases at equilibrium , is not unexpected : the terminology `` granular temperature '' for the kinetic energy of a granular gas has been coined from the equivalence of temperature and kinetic energy in an elastic gas , but does not have any thermodynamical status in out - of - equilibrium systems like inelastic granular gases .    in recent experiments ,",
    "the granular temperatures have been measured for binary mixtures , both in 3d vibro - fluidized granular beds @xcite and in 2d strongly vibrated granular gases @xcite . both studies reported a clear violation of equipartition with a temperature ratio quite insensitive to the relative densities of the two species .",
    "the present article aims at providing a simple theoretical framework where the temperature ratio is readily obtained in a non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) .",
    "this allows to investigate the influence of many parameters which can be difficult to tune experimentally , such as the masses , sizes , densities and inelasticities of the beads .",
    "we consider analytically a heated binary mixture in the framework of the homogeneous non - linear ( enskog-)boltzmann equation for smooth inelastic hard spheres .",
    "similarly to the case of free cooling described in @xcite and restricting to gaussian velocity distributions , we derive in section [ sec:2 ] equations for the granular temperatures of the mixture components , which are easily solved numerically .",
    "the corresponding temperature ratio is in excellent agreement with existing numerical work @xcite . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we consider the ness sustained by heating through random kicks ( `` stochastic thermostat '' approach ) , a mechanism which has focused some attention recently for one - component ( monodisperse ) systems @xcite .",
    "although finding an energy injection mechanism of experimental relevance is a difficult issue , we expect the approach proposed here to elucidate the basic trends of grain behaviour when varying the controlling parameters .",
    "moreover , as will be shown below , the temperature ratio we obtain provides a reasonable zeroth order approximation to compare with the experiments reported in @xcite .",
    "we consider the model of smooth inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) undergoing binary , momentum conserving , inelastic collisions , in the framework of the homogeneous non - linear enskog equation .",
    "the system is a mixture of two types of ihs , with masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 , diameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "three types of collisions may occur so that the mixture is also characterized by three different restitution coefficients : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the velocity distributions in the homogeneous state @xmath8 , @xmath9 , obey the following kinetic equations : @xmath10 + { \\cal f}f_i \\label{eq : jij}\\ ] ] where the @xmath11 describe the effect of dissipative inter - particle collisions , and @xmath12 represents an external forcing which injects energy into the system , allowing it to reach a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the kernels @xmath11 for collisions between a particle of type @xmath13 and a particle of type @xmath14 are given , in dimension @xmath15 , by @xmath16 = \\chi_{ij } \\sigma_{ij}^{d-1 } \\int d\\bm{v}_2 \\int ' d\\widehat{\\bm{\\sigma } }   ( \\widehat{\\bm{\\sigma}}\\cdot \\bm{v}_{12 } ) \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{ij}^2 } f_i(\\bm{v}_1')f_j(\\bm{v}_2 ' ) -",
    "f_i(\\bm{v}_1)f_j(\\bm{v}_2 ) \\right ) \\ .\\ ] ] where the @xmath17 are the pair distribution functions at contact ( a priori unknown , but becoming close to 1 in the limit of low densities ) ; @xmath18 is a unit vector directed from the center of the particle of type @xmath13 to the center of particle @xmath14 [ separated at contact by @xmath19 , and the prime on the integral is a shortcut for @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 , and the pre - collisional velocities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given in terms of the post - collisional velocities @xmath24 and @xmath25 by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , so that momentum is conserved but energy dissipated .",
    "the partial granular temperatures are defined from the kinetic energies by @xmath28 @xmath29 being the number density of particles of type @xmath13 with a total temperature of the mixture @xmath30    from ( [ eq : jij ] ) , the evolution equation for the temperatures reads @xmath31 + { \\cal ft}_i \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 describes the effect of the forcing ( source ) term @xmath33 .",
    "it is possible to integrate over @xmath18 ( see calculations in the appendix , and also @xcite ) to obtain , without any further approximation at this stage : @xmath34 \\label{eq : cooling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 the euler function .    since the system reaches a stationary state where the forcing term balances the dissipation due to collisions ( the forcing and dissipative terms in ( [ eq : cooling ] ) generically involve different powers of the temperatures so that its right - hand - side admits a `` physical '' root ) , we can write @xmath38 .",
    "it is moreover convenient to scale the velocities with the thermal velocities @xmath39 , and introduce the functions @xmath40 such that @xmath41    equation ( [ eq : cooling ] ) may then be cast into an equation for the rescaled velocity distributions @xmath40 ; no further step can however be taken without some approximations on the unknown distributions @xmath40 .",
    "it is convenient to study the deviations of @xmath40 from the gaussian @xmath42 through an expansion in sonine polynomials @xcite . in single component heated systems ,",
    "the deviation from a gaussian remains small , especially for experimentally relevant values of the restitution coefficient @xcite .",
    "we will here limit our treatment to the gaussian approximation @xmath43 ( lowest order sonine expansion ) .",
    "it would of course be possible to go further in a systematic and controlled way , as in @xcite , but we will see by comparison of our approximate analytical calculations with monte carlo simulations that , at least in the cases we consider , the gaussian approximation provides reliable results .",
    "assuming gaussian velocity distributions , it is now possible to carry out the remaining integrations in ( [ eq : cooling ] ) ; the calculations are straightforward and some technical details may be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we only give the resulting equations for the granular temperatures @xmath44 in the ness : @xmath45 \\left ( \\frac{2t_i}{m_i } +   \\frac{2t_j}{m_j } \\right)^{1/2 } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : t1t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations still depend on the particular heating mechanism through the term @xmath32 ; once the latter has been specified , two equations are obtained for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; they are easy to implement and solve numerically varying the various controlling parameters .    before turning to the heating provided by a stochastic thermostat [ which amounts to @xmath48",
    ", we consider three particular limiting cases .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in the tracer limit @xcite , i.e. @xmath49 , without any forcing term , @xmath47 is imposed and only the equation for @xmath46 is considered . as already noted in @xcite , the result for @xmath50 obtained in @xcite @xmath51",
    "is easily recovered , irrespective of dimension .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    another possibility to obtain a ness for ihs has been proposed in @xcite : the temperature @xmath52 of one population is imposed , with a corresponding gaussian velocity distribution , and elastic collisions between particles of type @xmath53 as well as for @xmath54 collisions : @xmath55 .",
    "energy is consequently injected into the inelastic population @xmath56 ( with restitution coefficient @xmath57 ) , without the need for any other forcing term . in @xcite , high precision numerical results were obtained for the distribution function @xmath58 , and temperature @xmath46 ( the system is three - dimensional , and @xmath59 ) , by an iterative numerical resolution of the boltzmann equation . imposing @xmath60 in ( [ eq : t1t2 ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain a third order polynomial equation for @xmath50 ( this quantity is necessarily smaller than 1 ) @xmath61    in fig .",
    "[ fig : biben ] , the solution of equation ( [ eq : biben ] ) is compared to the results reported in @xcite .",
    "the agreement is excellent , which may be traced back to the analysis of @xcite , showing that the distribution function @xmath58 is very close to a gaussian , although mathematically different ( on the other hand and by definition of the model , @xmath62 is strictly speaking a gaussian ) .",
    "the slight discrepancy obtained at low @xmath63 for @xmath64 corresponds to values of the parameters for which the deviation of @xmath58 from a gaussian is stronger .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    finally , a forcing term @xmath65 $ ] , which provides an enskog - boltzmann equation formally equivalent to the free cooling case ( see e.g. @xcite ) , leads back to the results of @xcite obtained in this situation : the term @xmath32 is indeed proportional to @xmath44 , so that writing @xmath66 in ( [ eq : cooling ] ) yields the same equation for @xmath67 as equating the two cooling rates @xmath68 when @xmath69 .",
    "in this section , we consider the situation of energy supply through random kicks @xcite : the particles are submitted between collisions to an uncorrelated white noise ( e.g. gaussian ) .",
    "the equation of motion for a particle is then @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the force due to inelastic collisions , and @xmath72 , where greek indices refer to cartesian coordinates .",
    "the associated forcing term in the enskog equation is @xmath73 so that @xmath74 .",
    "we do not claim that the forcing term considered here is the most suited to describe vibro - fluidized beds , but it mimics an important effect of energy injection by a moving piston : in experiments , particles undergoing collisions with the piston ( of large mass ) gain a velocity that is decorrelated from their masses , so that more kinetic energy is injected into the population of large mass .",
    "the corresponding equation for @xmath50 reads : @xmath75 \\,=\\ , \\chi_{22}\\ , \\sigma_{22}^{d-1 } ( 1-\\alpha_{22}^2 ) \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the temperature ratio @xmath67 therefore depends in a non - trivial way on the ratios of masses , densities and diameters , and also on the inelasticities @xmath76 and pair correlation functions @xmath17 .",
    "it may be checked that in the limit of vanishing inelasticities , @xmath77 as it should . moreover , for mechanically equivalent particles ( i.e. @xmath64 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , we should also recover equipartition ( @xmath80 ) irrespective of densities .",
    "this is the case in the boltzmann limit ( low densities where all pair correlation functions @xmath81 ) . at arbitrary packing fraction ,",
    "the various approximation for the @xmath17 that may be found in the literature @xcite are such that @xmath17 no longer depends on @xmath13 and @xmath14 when @xmath78 , so that equipartition holds for mechanically equivalent particles .",
    "since equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) relies on a gaussian approximation for @xmath40 , we have compared our approach to the results of monte carlo simulations ( the so - called dsmc technique @xcite ) where the non - linear boltzmann equation is solved numerically for both species . as we solve numerically the _ homogeneous _ boltzmann equation ,",
    "the phenomena of segregation or clustering are explicitly discarded .    in the following sections , we will study more precisely some cases that could have experimental relevance , and for the sake of simplicity , we considered @xmath59 .",
    "all the results are given for the three dimensional case ; note however that for @xmath78 the temperature ratio becomes @xmath15-independent .",
    "we first consider the case of equal restitution coefficients ( @xmath82 ) , for materials having similar elastic properties .",
    "the dependence of @xmath67 on the mass and number density ratios , for equal sizes , is shown in figure [ fig : samealpha ] .",
    "excellent agreement is found between dsmc simulations ( symbols ) and the solution of equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "it turns out indeed that the velocity distributions measured in monte carlo simulations are very close to gaussians . as may be expected , @xmath67 is a decreasing function of @xmath83 .",
    "the density dependence is relatively weak ( the temperature ratio slightly increases when @xmath84 increases by an order of magnitude ) .",
    "we have also considered two types of beads of the same material , i.e. the same restitution coefficient @xmath79 and same mass density @xmath85 : the ratio of masses @xmath83 is then equal to @xmath86 for three - dimensional beads .",
    "figure [ fig : samematerial ] shows a strong influence of the size ratio , for two experimentally relevant values of @xmath63 : @xmath67 decreases very strongly as soon as @xmath4 is two or three times @xmath3 . once again , the number density ratio has a relatively small incidence on @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting to disentangle the effects of @xmath87 and @xmath83 , by varying one parameter alone , the other being kept constant .",
    "it appears that the leading effect in the decrease of @xmath67 observed in figure [ fig : samematerial ] is ascribable to a change in mass ratio , and not in size : the results obtained at @xmath78 varying @xmath83 are close to those reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : samematerial ] , but surprisingly give a lower @xmath67 ( e.g. the results displayed in figure [ fig : samematerial ] for @xmath88 and equal densities are @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , whereas with @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 ) .      for glass spheres with size ratio @xmath97 , wildman and parker",
    "have measured a temperature ratio @xmath98 in the range 0.75 - 0.8 @xcite , with a weak dependence on densities ( except may be in the limit of large grains predominance where @xmath99 ) .",
    "estimating the relevant restitution coefficient to be @xmath100 @xcite , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) @xmath101 ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : samematerial ] ) , with also a weak dependence on @xmath84 .",
    "it is however noteworthy that this weak dependence is opposite to that observed experimentally : when the proportion of large grains is increased , we obtain an increase of @xmath67 . for comparison , the temperature ratio obtained for the same parameters in the homogeneous cooling stage @xcite is @xmath102 and the authors of @xcite proposed a simplified theory for which @xmath67 is in the range 0.4 - 0.7 .",
    "the results obtained by feitosa and menon @xcite confirm the very weak influence of @xmath84 when the grains ( of equal size ) are made of two different materials .",
    "for a mixture glass / aluminum with mass ratio @xmath103 , @xmath67 is measured very close to 1 , whereas for a more asymmetric mixture of glass and brass with @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "making use of equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) with schematic inelasticities @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 . in the free cooling regime ,",

    "@xmath67 in nevertheless generically smaller than @xmath56 for @xmath114 : the heavier particles have a larger kinetic energy .",
    "we have considered heated binary granular mixtures from the point of view of kinetic theory . as in the free cooling case , and in agreement with recent experimental data , the granular temperatures of the components of the mixture differ .",
    "this finding is not surprising in a non - equilibrium system , where the``temperature '' does not have any thermodynamical relevance .    using a mean - field approach with the assumption of isotropic gaussian velocity distributions ,",
    "we have derived an equation for the temperature ratio @xmath67 that may be adapted for various kinds of heating mechanisms , and easily solved once the controlling parameters have been chosen . in particular , the values obtained within the stochastic thermostat framework are compatible with those measured in the experiments reported in @xcite . even if a quantitative comparison with experiments is somehow pointless given the simplicity of our approach , similar trends are observed .",
    "for example , the heavier particles carry generically more kinetic energy than the lighter ones , the ratio being insensitive to the relative number fraction of both species",
