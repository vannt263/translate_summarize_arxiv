    "electroweak ( ew ) theory enters collider physics in three distinct places .",
    "precision calculations at high loop orders ( reviewed in section  [ pseudo - observables ] ) are required to compute so - called pseudo - observables , such as the mass and width of the w boson or the weak mixing angle , so as to permit a meaningful comparison with their values extracted from experiment . in turn , this extraction demands another class of computations that are used ( via monte carlo generators or explicitly applied corrections ) by the experimentalists to interpret their data ( see section  [ predictions ] ) .",
    "finally , all relevant experimental and theoretical information needs to be gathered and analyzed simultaneously .",
    "this necessitates a careful consideration of experimental correlations ; the identification of common theoretical uncertainties ; a globally defined set of input and fit parameters ; and the conversion of the various theoretical results to a self - consistent framework of conventions and renormalization schemes .",
    "furthermore , constraints on new particles arise both , directly from searches and indirectly from very high precision measurements where they may leave footprints , so appropriate combination procedures must be applied .",
    "section  [ combination ] exemplifies this using current constraints on the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "section  [ precision ] summarizes the prospects for future precision measurements in the higgs sector and of key ew parameters at existing and proposed accelerators .",
    "the four heavy weights of the sm , the higgs , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bosons , and the top quark , satisfy , respectively , the simple tree level relations , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value , @xmath6^{-1/2 } = 246.2209 \\pm 0.0005 $ ]  gev , of the cp - even ( real ) higgs field component , @xmath7 , is determined using the latest experimental results on the @xmath8 lifetime  @xcite and the two - loop calculation  @xcite to @xmath8 decay .",
    "@xmath9 is defined relative to the higgs potential ( in unitary gauge after spontaneous symmetry breaking ) , @xmath10 while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the gauge couplings and @xmath13 is the top quark yukawa coupling ( in an appropriate normalization ) .",
    "these relations are modified by ew radiative corrections .",
    "e.g. , the parameter @xmath14 may be defined by  @xcite , @xmath15 showing its leading quadratic @xmath16 dependence  @xcite , where @xmath17 , while @xmath18 may be any coupling constant based definition . in the following we use the one based on @xmath19 scheme renormalization with some logarithmic @xmath16 dependence removed , so that the relation to the effective @xmath1 pole mixing angle is almost a constant shift  @xcite , @xmath20 the remaining parameter  @xcite has a dominantly logarithmic @xmath16 dependence and gets a contribution from the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) of the qed coupling to the @xmath1 scale ( injecting an uncertainty from quark loops ) , @xmath21    except for @xmath22 , the full two - loop contributions  @xcite to these parameters were completed recently .",
    "these calculations became necessary after the leading first two terms in an expansion in @xmath23 , those of @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath25  @xcite , showed very poor convergence .",
    "the leading three - loop terms of @xmath26  @xcite and @xmath27  @xcite have also been found . the level of precision anticipated for the lhc and the ilc also requires the knowledge of mixed qcd - ew effects , especially if enhanced .",
    "the leading contributions of this type are of @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite . at the three - loop level ,",
    "all terms of @xmath30 are known , including both singlet ( purely gluonic )  @xcite and non - singlet  @xcite terms , and for the latter case also the next two terms in the expansion in @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "even the four - loop terms of @xmath31 have been calculated , again both of singlet  @xcite and non - singlet  @xcite types . finally , at the level of two ew loops , the @xmath32 result were found in  @xcite .",
    "these results ensure solid sm predictions for pseudo - observables at the lhc , and for almost most purposes even at the ilc .",
    "the pre - lhc era , driven largely by the very high precision @xmath1 pole programs at lep and the slc , witnessed a new level of direct cooperation between experimental and theoretical high energy physics . not only provided theorists and experimentalists each other with guidance , but precision calculations entered directly into measurement processes , in many cases in each step from the planning to final analysis phases .",
    "conversely , experimental information was not only used but also specifically produced to pitch in wherever theory was unable to provide solid answers as showcased by the hadronic contributions to the muon @xmath33 , @xmath34 , or the rge of @xmath35 . as a by - product of this mutual influence , much more time and effort is now being spent to estimate theoretical uncertainties , a task that is difficult and at the same time indispensable given that these enter straight into the quoted experimental results .    as for the future , the further increase in precision will also require to account for theoretical correlations that can occur .",
    "this is  once individual contributions to theory uncertainties have been obtained and agreed upon  in fact a more straightforward exercise , but one that so far is often neglected as it can be tedious and time consuming .",
    "the simultaneous incorporation of information from multiple sources will also intensify .",
    "new particles will be looked for in both real production and loops . up to now",
    "these two sectors are analyzed independently or rough ( lower ) bounds on new particle masses are imposed when interpreting pseudo - observables in terms of them .",
    "however , at variance with lepton colliders , the search results of the lhc and already at the tevatron run ii can not be approximated by sharp edged exclusion limits even in cases where no excess of events is observed , but will generally take a functional form in a multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "an example is given in figure  [ tevatron - higgs ] for the sm higgs boson .",
    "from the tevatron  @xcite ( lep searches  @xcite are also included ) .",
    "the observed llr ( solid line ) can be added to the minimum @xmath36-function obtained from the precision data , resulting in the probability distribution shown on the right.,title=\"fig:\",height=234 ] from the tevatron  @xcite ( lep searches  @xcite are also included ) . the observed llr ( solid line )",
    "can be added to the minimum @xmath36-function obtained from the precision data , resulting in the probability distribution shown on the right.,title=\"fig:\",height=234 ]",
    "kinematic reconstruction entirely dominates the current average of @xmath37  gev from lep  2  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite . the final tevatron combination of the @xmath38 and @xmath8 decay modes may yield a precision of @xmath39  mev , while the lhc ( after high luminosity running and the collection of about 400  fb@xmath40 ) could achieve @xmath41  ( 7 )  mev for the @xmath38 ( @xmath8 ) final state alone .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath42  mev would also be achievable with a @xmath43 threshold scan at an ilc .",
    "@xmath35 has been measured very precisely at lep and the slc  @xcite , but the long - standing @xmath44 conflict between the most precise values , namely from the left - right polarization asymmetry ( sld ) and the forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry into @xmath45-quarks ( lep ) , has never been resolved .",
    "future determinations of @xmath35 of similar precision are therefore badly needed and may be possible to obtain by improving the existing measurements of the leptonic fb asymmetries at the tevatron  @xcite and polarized mller scattering at slac  @xcite , the latter being discussed as an interesting opportunity for cebaf ( jlab ) .",
    "the mller asymmetry would also be the basis for the best determination ( @xmath46 ) at the ilc , unless the gigaz option were realized which would yield the ultimate precision of @xmath47 .",
    "the lhc at high luminosity could also contribute a very high precision measurement comparable to the current world average provided large rapidity coverage ( up to @xmath48 for jets and missing transverse energy ) can be achieved .    for an unambiguous interpretation of these measurements",
    "one needs and expects improved determinations of @xmath16 and @xmath49 , calling for further experimental and theoretical efforts in both cases . in the optimistic scenario with an ilc @xmath50 threshold scan ( @xmath51  mev ) , a gigaz , a reduction in the error of @xmath49 by a factor of three , and a high precision constraint on @xmath52 ( both from ew and strong interaction processes )",
    ", one can determine @xmath53 from loop effects to within 4% .",
    "this is to be compared to a @xmath54 threshold scan with a target of @xmath55  mev .",
    "furthermore , one can compare these results with direct determinations of the higgs self - coupling , @xmath9 , although this would require a luminosity upgrade of the lhc : 3  ab@xmath40 of data could determine @xmath9 to 20% ( 70% ) for @xmath56  gev ( @xmath57  gev ) .",
    "thus , for a light higgs one would like an ilc for which a 20% measurement would be feasible even for @xmath58  gev . finally , the lhc could constrain heavy fermion yukawa and higgs gauge couplings in the range of 10 to 30% ( even before an upgrade ) while the ilc would be very precise here ( albeit less so for @xmath59 ) .",
    "more recently ew physics has been moving towards becoming a tool ( and background ) for other objectives .",
    "e.g. , one can measure the @xmath0 charge asymmetry and @xmath1 rapidity distributions at hadron colliders to obtain information about parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . or one can compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross - sections in tandem with pdfs to determine beam luminosities and detector efficiencies .    by identifying a high @xmath60 invariant mass peak , 100  fb@xmath40 of lhc data",
    "could quite easily discover an extra @xmath61 boson not exceeding 4 to 5  tev in mass  @xcite , depending on the underlying @xmath62 symmetry . to diagnose the @xmath61",
    "one can consult leptonic fb asymmetries and experiments at low energy or low momentum transfer ( the @xmath1 pole is rather insensitive to new physics not affecting the @xmath1 couplings ) .",
    "likewise , a high @xmath63 transverse mass peak may reveal a @xmath64 .",
    "all this requires high precision predictions for single gauge boson production  @xcite for which the next - to - next - to - leading order fully differential cross - section with leading - logarithmic soft gluon re - summation for transverse momenta has been completed .",
    "@xmath65 ew corrections and final state single and mulitple @xmath66 radiation shift the extracted @xmath67 by 10 , @xmath68 and 10  mev , respectively .",
    "open issues include higher orders in the large ew sudakov - like logarithms , @xmath69 , @xmath29 corrections , non - perturbative qcd contributions , as well as small @xmath70 and heavy quark mass effects .",
