    "the perturbative expansions in weak coupling constant in quantum field theories are in general divergent , with the coefficients growing in factorial . one way to make a rigorous sense out of the divergent series is to resum the series using borel transform . when the large order behavior of the expansion is sign - alternating borel resummation may yield the full amplitude .",
    "but in qcd the series are in general of same - sign and not borel resummable , and must be augmented by nonperturbative effects .",
    "however , borel resummation can still be useful in these cases when a precise definition of the nonperturbative effects are required , or the coupling is large enough that the usual perturbative amplitude from the low order perturbations is not sufficiently accurate for the purpose .",
    "the same - sign large order behavior of weak coupling expansion gives a singularity ( renormalon ) on the contour of the borel integral .",
    "when the coupling is small the borel integral receives most of its contribution from the immediate neighborhood of the origin , where the borel transform can be well - described by the low order perturbations , and the singular behavior of the borel transform is not of much concern , but as the coupling increases the contribution from the region near the singularity becomes important , and one needs to have an accurate description of the borel transform in the region that contains the origin as well as the nearest singularity to the origin .",
    "it is obvious that it is a formidable task to rebuild the singular behavior of the borel transform using the ordinary perturbative expansions about the origin .",
    "in fact , the solvable models like the quantum mechanical instanton models suggest that one need many 10s orders of perturbative terms to obtain a good borel resummation . this approach is obviously not viable in qcd considering the high cost of loop calculations .",
    "thus an alternative approach is required to do any attempt for realistic borel resummation with the low order perturbations in qcd .",
    "the nature of the renormalon singularity can be determined by renormalization group technique , and the ( singular part of ) borel transform near the singularity can be systematically expanded perturbatively , up to the residue of the singularity that determines the overall normalization constant of the large order behavior ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "it was later realized that , once the nature of the singularity is known , the residue too can be calculated perturbatively , using only the usual perturbative expansions of the quantity in concern @xcite .",
    "we thus have a systematic expansion of the borel transform at two points , the origin as well as the singularity .",
    "the bilocal expansion is to combine these expansions via an interpolation to obtain an accurate description of the borel transform not only about the origin but also about the singularity @xcite .",
    "the bilocal expansion has been successfully applied to several qcd observables @xcite , and following is a review of those applications .",
    "let us assume that the borel transform @xmath0 of an amplitude has the perturbative expansion about the origin to order @xmath1 as @xmath2 and expansion about the nearest renormalon singularity to order @xmath3 as @xmath4 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\rm analytic \\,\\,\\,\\,part } \\label{exp.sing}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the location of the singularity .",
    "the `` analytic part '' denotes terms that are analytic on the disk @xmath6 , and in general is not known .",
    "we can now combine the expansions ( [ exp.org ] ) and ( [ exp.sing ] ) as a bilocal expansion using the following interpolation @xcite : @xmath7   \\label{bilocal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we compare this expression to ( [ exp.sing ] ) we see that the first sum simulates the `` analytic part '' .",
    "the coefficients @xmath8 can be determined by demanding that the bilocal expansion , when expanded about the origin , reproduce the perturbative expansion ( [ exp.org ] ) .",
    "this yields the relation @xmath9 \\,,\\nonumber\\\\ h_2&= & a_2-\\frac{{\\cal n}}{b_0 ^ 2}[(\\nu+1)(\\nu+2)+\\sum_{j=1}^n[c_j ( j(j-1 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & -2(1+\\nu)j+(\\nu+1)(\\nu+2))]\\ , ,    \\mbox{\\small etc . } \\label{h - coeffs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exact borel transform is given by the limit of the bilocal expansion : @xmath10    for the bilocal expansion to be usable it is necessary to compute the residue @xmath11 .",
    "since the residue determines the normalization constant of the large order behavior , the borel transform in bilocal expansion ( [ bilocal ] ) allows one to resum the divergent series to all orders once the residue is known .",
    "the residue can be perturbatively computed as follows . noticing that @xmath12 where @xmath13 one can expand r(b ) about the origin to evaluate @xmath14 .",
    "notice that the expansion involves only the usual perturbative coefficients @xmath15 . although @xmath16 is not analytic at @xmath5 , the expansion is nevertheless convergent because @xmath16 is bounded at the singularity .",
    "fortunately , for several qcd observables this expansion gives a rather quick convergence .",
    "adler function is such an example ( see table [ adler ] ) @xcite .",
    "[ adler ]    ._residue for the adler function with @xmath17 quark flavor . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , when the lattice spacing and the heavy - quark mass are far - different the scale mixing problem appears .",
    "for an ( imaginary ) heavy - light meson with mass @xmath18 gev we obtain , using ( [ brmatching ] ) , the br mass : @xmath19 at @xmath20 2.12 , 2.91 , 3.85 ( gev ) , respectively , and using the relation @xmath21 we obtain the corresponding @xmath22 mass @xmath23 what is remarkable with this result is that the uncertainties in these numbers are only @xmath24 mev , entirely coming from @xmath25 and the conversion to @xmath26 from the br mass , both of which cause less than 20 mev uncertainty .    on the other hand , with the conventional method using ( [ pertmethod ] ) , the @xmath26 obtained",
    "shows strong dependence on the rg scale @xmath27 which can be anywhere in a wide range between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the uncertaintities in the heavy quark mass from this approach are several hundred mevs , which are an order of magnitude larger than those in the borel resummation method . for details",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "with the bilocal expansion borel resummation for certain qcd observables can be done to a remarkable accuracy with the low order perturbations .",
    "the salient feature of the borel resummation is the automatic isolation of hierarchical scales , which can be useful in quarkonium systems .",
