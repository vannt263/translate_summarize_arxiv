    "a huge degeneracy of classical ground states in geometrically frustrated magnets can be lifted by quantum or thermal fluctuations via a so called order by disorder effect @xcite . in the present work we study the _ thermal _ order by disorder effect for the @xmath0 antiferromagnet on a checkerboard lattice .",
    "this lattice is a two - dimensional network of corner - sharing squares with crossings , which are topologically equivalent to tetrahedra , see fig .",
    "[ zero - field ] .",
    "the present model can , therefore , be relevant to real pyrochlores with the easy - plane type anisotropy er@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and er@xmath1sn@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and also have an experimental realization as an array of the josephson junctions or a superconducting wires network in transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the considered model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the classical planar spins and @xmath5 is in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the sum is over nearest - neighbors pairs on a checkerboard lattice and @xmath6 is an antiferromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "the hamiltonian can be expressed as a sum over elementary plaquettes ( squares with crossings ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total magnetisation of a plaquette , @xmath9 is the number of sites on the lattice and @xmath10 is the number of plaquettes .",
    "minimizing energy of a single plaquette one obtains the classical constraint @xmath11 the minimal total energy is reached if the above constraint is satisfied on every plaquette . in the field range @xmath12",
    "the ground state of the model remains underconstrained and infinitely degenerate with a finite entropy .",
    "this huge degeneracy is determined by two factors : ( i ) possible basis spin quartets , which obey the classical constraint , are parametrized by two continuous variables and ( ii ) by various periodic and aperiodic spin structures formed with the same basis quartet .",
    "the latter property can be seen by looking at the fourier transform of the interactions on the checkerboard lattice @xcite , which has a flat momentum - independent branch with minimal energy .",
    "since the degeneracy of the classical ground state is a consequence of lattice topology rather than being a symmetry imposed property , various classical ground state configurations have different excitation spectra . at finite temperatures",
    "magnetic system spans a phase volume in the vicinity of the ground state manifold . due to a varying density of excitations ,",
    "the system can be effectively trapped in the neighbourhood of certain ground states .",
    "such an ergodicity breaking leads to a lifting of zero-@xmath13 degeneracy of a frustrated magnet and to thermal order by disorder selection .",
    "the statistical weights of different ground state configurations @xmath14 are given by @xmath15\\sim \\exp(-f[\\psi]/t)$ ] , where @xmath16 $ ] is the partial free energy obtained by integrating out ` fast ' excitation modes .",
    "the minimum of @xmath16 $ ] ensures that a macroscopic system is trapped in the vicinity @xmath17 and probability to find it in another classical ground state is vanishingly small .    to find which spin configurations",
    "are favoured by thermal fluctuations we start with a simple perturbative treatment over the mean - field result . in the ground state configuration a magnitude of a local field derived from eq .",
    "( [ ham - plaquette ] ) is the same @xmath18 for all sites and all external fields @xmath19 .",
    "the harmonic spin - wave hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath20 where components of every spin are taken in its local coordinate frame and @xmath21 is an angle between neighbouring spins . the first term in @xmath22 , which describes uncorrelated fluctuations of individual spins with @xmath23 , is taken as an unperturbed spin - fluctuation hamiltonian , whereas the second term is a perturbation @xmath24 .",
    "the correction to the free - energy is given by @xmath25 : @xmath26 thermal fluctuations produce , therefore , an effective biquadratic exchange , which lifts the zero-@xmath13 degeneracy in favour of maximally collinear states with the largest number of @xmath27 .",
    "the harmonic hamiltonian can be , of course , diagonalized with the help of the fourier transform to obtain the spin wave modes @xmath28 and their contribution to the free - energy : @xmath29 the problem is reduced to minimization of the sum in ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "still the real - space second order perturbation result appears to give a correct first insight especially for multisublattice configurations with @xmath30 , when exact diagonalization of @xmath22 becomes increasingly cumbersome .",
    "an additional complication of highly frustrated magnets stems from a presence of several branches of zero modes : @xmath31 , in which case eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) is not anymore correct .",
    "instead the low-@xmath13 contribution to the free energy becomes : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of usual harmonic or quadratic modes , @xmath34 is the number of zero or soft modes , and @xmath35 is a contribution from interaction between soft modes and their interaction with quadratic modes . in order to estimate the last term one has to solve a nonlinear problem , which is , generally , a very complicated task .",
    "however , a partial selection between various spin configuration can be done on a basis of the leading @xmath36 term . if the total number @xmath37 is fixed ( @xmath38 for the @xmath0 checkerboard antiferromagnet ) , then",
    ", the free energy is minimal for states with the maximum number of soft modes .",
    "the number of soft modes can be found either from direct diagonalization of @xmath22 or from geometric consideration , which assigns a local soft mode to every void ( empty square ) with all spins around it being parallel or antiparallel to each other @xcite .",
    "thus , the soft modes act similar to harmonic excitations and stabilize collinear states .",
    "the presence of soft modes is most easily seen in the low - temperature specific heat , which is found from eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) to be @xmath39 .",
    "the deviation of the specific heat from a universal value of @xmath40 tells how many soft modes exist in a low - temperature state of the @xmath0 checkerboard antiferromagnet .",
    "at zero magnetic field the ground state constraint ( [ constraint ] ) specifies configurations with @xmath41 on every plaquette .",
    "such configurations can be constructed either from noncollinear or collinear spin quartets . as was argued above",
    ", thermal fluctuations tend to select maximally collinear states with two up- and two down - spins on an arbitrarily chosen axis in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath42maps @xmath22 for an arbitrary collinear state on the same reference harmonic hamiltonian . every collinear state has , therefore , the same harmonic spectrum and the same number of zero ( soft ) modes @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the specific heat of a collinear state is @xmath44 .",
    "all terms in the low-@xmath13 expression for the free energy ( [ df ] ) except the last one coincide for all collinear states .",
    "our estimate indicates that the nel state with the ordering wave - vector @xmath45 on the original square lattice has the lowest anharmonic contribution @xmath35 among all translationally symmetric states .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily mean an appearance of a quasi long - range order at @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "so called weathervane defects @xcite or wondering ( rough ) domain walls @xcite have been considered as a source of disorder for the kagome antiferromagnet . for the @xmath0 checkerboard antiferromagnet",
    "there are no zero - width domain walls and only weathervane defects can destroy a quasi long - range translational order .",
    "they cost zero classical energy and increase the free - energy by @xmath48 .",
    "a finite @xmath13-independent density of such defects can be estimated as @xmath49 by neglecting interaction between defects .",
    "these defects can destroy the true long - range order if their concentration exceeds the percolation threshold on the corresponding lattice . in this case only nematic correlations desribed by a traceless second - rank tensor @xmath50 will be present at low temperatures .    in the absence of analytical theory to deal with this sort of behaviour",
    "we have tried to derive the necessary information from monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have calculated squares of the two relevant low-@xmath13 order parameters : @xmath51 the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ zero - field ] .",
    "there is a clear signature of the nematic order seen by the enhancement of @xmath52 at low temperatures .",
    "the nel order parameter reaches only very small values and does not show any appreciable enhancement . considering a change in the scaling behaviour of the nematic order parameter @xmath53 from @xmath54 , short - range correlations , at high temperatures to @xmath55 , power - law correlations , at low temperatures we estimate the kosterlits - touless transition temperature as @xmath56 .    .",
    "[ zero - field],width=491 ]",
    "in external magnetic fields @xmath57 the ground states with intermediate magnetisation ( [ constraint ] ) are , generally , noncollinear , except for @xmath58 , when a collinear ` @xmath59 ' state , fig .  [ finite - field]b , belongs to the ground state manifold .",
    "selection of the @xmath59 states by thermal fluctuations leads to a 1/2-magnetization plateau , which is similar to a 1/3-plateau of a classical kagome antiferromagnet @xcite . at all other fields only a partial collinearity is possible in the classical ground state .",
    "geometric consideration suggests two prime candidate states shown in fig .",
    "[ finite - field ] .",
    "the first canted state , fig .",
    "[ finite - field]a , exists in the whole range of fields and does not break remaining spin reflection symmetry about the field direction .",
    "the second partially collinear state , fig .",
    "[ finite - field]c , with three identical sublattices appears only for @xmath60 and does break the mirror symmetry .",
    "it is easy to check that the fluctuation induced biquadratic exchange ( [ hambi ] ) favours a ` more ' collinear state with broken reflection symmetry @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 over a ` less ' collinear canted state @xmath63 $ ] in the whole range of existence of the former state .",

    "bottom right panel : the evolution of the triatic order parameter for the same cluster .",
    "the inset shows the field dependence of @xmath65 corresponding to state ( d ) for lattice sizes @xmath66 , 400 , 1024 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "magnetic field is given in units of @xmath67 .",
    "[ finite - field],width=491 ]    the translational degeneracy of the high - field partially collinear states is similar to the degeneracy of the @xmath59 states and corresponds to the dimer coverings of a square lattice @xcite , the total number of such states being @xmath68 .",
    "the problem of lifting translational degeneracy for the @xmath59 states is similar to the zero - field case discussed above .",
    "also , the @xmath59 have the same specific heat @xmath44 . for the partially collinear states there are additional features in the thermal order by disorder effect .",
    "a general partially collinear state does not have soft modes .",
    "soft modes , corresponding to all parallel spins around an empty square , exist , nevertheless , for certain translational patterns .",
    "the maximum number of soft modes @xmath69 appears for a state shown in fig .",
    "[ finite - field]d , which corresponds to a columnar arrangement of effective dimers .",
    "such a translational pattern has the lowest @xmath36 contribution to the free energy .",
    "however , for all temperatures @xmath70 accessible with our monte carlo code we did not find a nonvanishing value of the structure factor corresponding to the this state .",
    "thus , there is no a conventional ising order parameter @xmath71 , @xmath72 in the high - field partially collinear state .",
    "instead an ising reflection symmetry is broken by a unique triatic order parameter : @xmath73    for monte carlo simulations of the @xmath0 chekcer - board antiferromagnet we have used the standard metropolis algorithm discarding @xmath74 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) to reach thermal equilibrium and , then , average observables over @xmath75@xmath76 mcs .",
    "the lattice sizes were up to @xmath77 . in order to estimate statistical errors ,",
    "all results have been averaged over 1020 runs . the field dependence of the specific heat @xmath78 is shown in fig .",
    "[ finite - field ] for @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath78 starts at value , which is very close to analytically predicted @xmath79 .",
    "in applied field the system looses gradually soft modes up to @xmath80 , where @xmath59 state with @xmath44 appears .",
    "the peaks in the specific heat at @xmath81 and @xmath82 indicate the phase transitions to a high - field state with broken reflection symmetry .",
    "the order parameters for this state are presented in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ finite - field ] .",
    "the square of the triatic order parameter @xmath83 is nonzero between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it shows a good statistical averaging and very little finite size dependence : results for smaller clusters fall on top of the presented data for @xmath77 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath65 with @xmath86 on a new lattice built from one sort of tetrahedra , which should be nonzero if the long - range order corresponding to fig .",
    "[ finite - field]d is present .",
    "the obtained data show that @xmath87 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , the high - field state is described by the triatic order parameter @xmath83 , which makes the checkerboard lattice to be similar to a classical kagome antiferromagnet @xcite .",
