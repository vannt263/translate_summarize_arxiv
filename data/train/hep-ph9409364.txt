    "the cp asymmetries in the color - suppressed processes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , could , in principle , determine the angle @xmath11 in the unitarity triangle@xcite .",
    "for this to be possible several conditions have to be met , one of which being that these transitions be dominated by a single process - in this case the factorized amplitude .",
    "these decays being color - suppressed ( amplitude proportional to the parameter @xmath12@xcite ) have a smaller branching fraction than the color - favored modes such as @xmath13 and @xmath14@xcite , whose decay amplitudes are proportional to the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a non - factorizable effect could , in principle , contribute a larger fraction of the total amplitude to the color - suppressed modes than to the color - favored ones .",
    "ref.[4 ] has shown that within the factorization scheme none of the popular models of hadronic form factors explain the measured value of the longitudinal polarization fraction@xmath16 .",
    "same conclusions have been reached by the authors of ref.[5 ] .",
    "the implication is that if the experiments are correct then either the factorization hypothesis breaks down or the model - form factors and their @xmath4 extrapolations are incorrect .",
    "in order to test factorization in color suppressed decays of b into charmonium one could use @xmath17 as has been done in ref.[6 ] , or @xmath18 as we do here . to be useful , the value of the testable quantity must span a reasonably narrow range and be as independent of the assumptions on the form factors and their @xmath19 dependence as possible . as we will see in this paper",
    "the last condition is hard to meet .",
    "thus we deem our study to be more of a @xmath20probe@xmath21 than a @xmath22test@xmath21 of factorization scheme .    in order to study the predictions of the factorization scheme in @xmath23",
    "decays , let us define three ratios ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is @xmath26 .    in the factorization scheme",
    "the ratio r depends on @xmath27 , @xmath28 , both of which are known with reasonably small errors , and how the form factor @xmath29 extrapolates from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and not its absolute value .",
    "we discuss the details of the calculation in the next section .",
    "ratio @xmath32 , in the factorization scheme , depends , in addition to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , on the following ratios@xcite , @xmath33 and @xmath34    we determine the ranges of allowed values of @xmath35 and ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) as follows .",
    "first , using the weighted average of the longitudinal polarization fraction , @xmath38 measured by cleo@xcite and cdf@xcite , we determine the allowed range of the parameter set @xmath39 by the method detailed in ref.[4 ] .",
    "to extrapolate @xmath35 to @xmath40 we use seven different assumed scenarios for the behavior of the form factors @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this then enables us to calculate the ratios @xmath44 and @xmath6 of eq.(2 ) and ( 3 ) in each scenario .",
    "details follow below .",
    ":    we start with an estimate of the ratio r defined in eq.(1 ) . in the factorization scheme it is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the centre of mass momenta in @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . using @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 mev@xcite",
    "we obtain @xmath52 using now a monopole@xcite or a dipole@xcite extrapolation for @xmath29 with pole mass of 5.43 gev , we get @xmath53 experimentally this ratio is known , albeit with large errors , for charged b decays@xcite . from the listed branching fractions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath56 the actual error in @xmath57 is probably much less as some of the systematic errors would cancel in the ratio . if we were to reduce the error by a third , a reasonable estimate of true error in eq.(9 )",
    "is @xmath58 .",
    "using heavy quark symmetry it has been shown @xcite that for heavy to heavy flavor transitions such as @xmath59 , the form factor @xmath60 ought to have a dipole structure though not necessarily with identical pole masses .",
    "the authors of ref.[9 ] then proceed to use a dipole form for @xmath61 , despite the fact that it is a heavy to light flavor transition , with some success .",
    "a comparison of eq.(8 ) and eq.(9 ) shows that the theoretical value of the ratio r calculated in the factorization scheme is in agreement with its experimental determination provided that @xmath62 has a dipole behavior . a monopole form of @xmath62 yields a value of r too large by one theoretical and an experimental standard deviation .",
    "if an independent case could be made ( and we are not aware of one ) for a dipole form for @xmath63 then our results would constitute a test positive for the factorization hypothesis . on the other hand , it must be said that a qcd sum rule - based calculation@xcite of @xmath64 is consistent with a monopole form with a pole mass of ( 5.25 @xmath65 0.1 ) gev .",
    "the case of @xmath63 is anticipated to be similar but with a pole mass in the region of 5.43 gev .",
    "we are not aware of a qcd sum rule - based calculation of @xmath66 and its @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the discussion above does not establish nor contradict the factorization hypothesis .",
    "the value of @xmath67 depends on the behavior of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , unlike @xmath68 transitions , @xmath69 transition involves a neutral current ; consequently @xmath66 can not be accessed through semileptonic b decays .    :    in the factorization scheme , the ratio @xmath32 is given by , @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the centre of mass momenta in @xmath10 and @xmath73 decays respectively , and @xmath74 @xmath35 and ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) have been defined in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and , as explained in the paragraph following ( 5 ) , ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) are related to @xmath35 by assumed scenarios of the @xmath4-dependence of the form factors . @xmath75 and ( @xmath76,@xmath77,@xmath78 ) are defined as in ref.[4 ] , @xmath79 ( @xmath80,@xmath81,@xmath82 ) are obtained from eq.(12 ) by replacing @xmath83 by @xmath84 and @xmath71 by @xmath72 .",
    "our procedure is to determine the allowed range of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 from @xmath87 data and then extrapolate them to ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) using assumed @xmath19 dependence for the form factors .",
    "for the longitudinal polarization fraction in @xmath88 we use a weighted average of the following data : @xmath89 with a weighted average , @xmath90 where we have added the statistical and the systematic errors in quadrature ,    as shown in ref.[4 ] , factorization assumption yields , @xmath91 the allowed region in @xmath35 plane determined from eqs.(14 ) and ( 15 ) is shown in fig.1 , where we have also indicated the six points representing the predictions of the six models ( or schemes ) referred to in ref.[4 ] . though we do not show this in fig.1 , cdf data by themselves are in agreement with the predictions of models a and f of fig.1 .",
    "having determined @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we obtain the corresponding @xmath36 and @xmath92 assuming the following seven different scenarios for the extrapolation of the form factors :    : @xmath41 and @xmath42 are flat ; @xmath43 is a monopole with pole mass 5.43 gev .",

    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are monopoles with pole masses 5.82 gev , and @xmath43 is a monopole with pole mass 5.43 gev .",

    "this is model bswii of ref.[4 ] .",
    "once we have obtained the values of @xmath36 and @xmath92 in each of the scenarios , we can calculate @xmath44 and @xmath6 of eq.(3 ) which is given by @xmath102    in table 1 we have shown our results for the predicted ranges of @xmath103 and @xmath6 in each of the seven scenarios .",
    "the stability of some numbers in table 1 can readily be understood .",
    "for example , it is evident from eq.(18 ) that the maximum value of @xmath104 occurs at @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and hence is scenario independent .",
    "the minimum occurs at ( 0,@xmath107 ) .",
    "this is scenario dependent , but , fortunately , this dependence is weak .",
    "thus independent of scenario for the @xmath4-dependence of the form factor , factorization scheme predicts that cleo and cdf data for @xmath108 imply that @xmath109 , and @xmath110 though weakly scenario - dependent .",
    "it is this rather limited range of @xmath111 that makes it a useful testing ground for the factorization hypothesis .    as for the ratio @xmath44 , it depends not only on the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( see eq.(10 ) ) but also on @xmath114 ( see eq.(11 ) ) . in scenarios 1 , 2 and 3 , where @xmath41 is flat , @xmath44 depends only on @xmath114 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath114 occurs at @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( this point maps to @xmath36 = 0 , @xmath92 = 0 ) and , hence , scenario - independent .",
    "the minimum of @xmath114 occurs at ( @xmath117,0 ) ( which maps to ( @xmath118,0 ) ) .",
    "hence the minimum is independent of @xmath119 .",
    "because of this , as scenarios 1 and 2 differ only in the behaviour of @xmath119 , both the maximum and minimum of @xmath114 are identical and , consequently , also @xmath44 .    from table 1",
    "it is evident that if @xmath41 falls with @xmath4 , @xmath44 rises and vice - versa .    from the branching ratios listed in ref.[3 ] for @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    ", we obtain @xmath122    again , due to partial cancellation of systematic errors the actual error is probably lower .    comparing the predicted values of @xmath44 in the seven different scenarios shown in table 1 with eq.(19 )",
    ", we can only conclude that if factorization assumption were to hold , then the only scenarios that are consistent with experiment are those in which @xmath41 rises with @xmath4 ; as to the behavior of @xmath42 and @xmath119 we learn little .",

    "we have studied the color - suppressed @xmath123 in the factorization scheme .",
    "we calculated the three ratios r , @xmath44 and @xmath111 defined in eqs.(1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 agrees with @xmath124 if @xmath29 were to have a dipole behavior in @xmath125 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one could argue ( and we are not aware of such an argument ) that @xmath66 has a monopole behavior in the region 0 @xmath94 , then we would construe our result as signalling a break - down of the factorization hypothesis .",
    "we do not claim to have tested factorization .    in order to calculate @xmath44 and @xmath126 we first determined @xmath35 from the measurement of @xmath108 , the longitudinal polarization in @xmath127 , and then mapped them to ( @xmath128,@xmath92 ) in seven assumed scenarios .",
    "we found that only in scenarios where @xmath41 was assumed to rise at least as fast as a monopole with pole mass 5.82 gev did the calculated value of @xmath44 agree with experiment .",

    "lastly , we wish to point out that whereas in ref.[4 ] where model calculations of the form factors ( both magnitude and @xmath130-dependence ) were confronted with data , here we needed to assume only the @xmath4-behavior of the form - factors in the region @xmath131 and not their absolute normalization .",
