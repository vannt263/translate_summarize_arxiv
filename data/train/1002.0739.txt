    "lattice reduction algorithms are essential tools in computational number theory and cryptography .",
    "a lattice is a discrete subset of @xmath0 that is also a @xmath1-module .",
    "the goal of lattice reduction is to find a ` nice ' basis for a lattice , one which is near orthogonal and composed of short vectors .",
    "since the publication of the 1982 lenstra , lenstra , lovsz  @xcite lattice reduction algorithm many applications have been discovered , such as polynomial factorization  @xcite and attacking several important public - key cryptosystems including knapsack cryptosystems  @xcite , rsa under certain settings  @xcite , and dsa and some signature schemes in particular settings  @xcite .",
    "one of the important features of the lll algorithm was that it could approximate the shortest vector of a lattice in polynomial time .",
    "this is valuable because finding the exact shortest vector in a lattice is provably np - hard  @xcite . given a basis @xmath2 which satisfies @xmath3 , the lll algorithm has a running time of @xmath4 using classical arithmetic .",
    "recently there has been a resurgence of lattice reduction work thanks to nguyen and stehl s @xmath5 algorithm  @xcite which performs lattice reduction in @xmath6)$ ] cpu operations .",
    "the primary result of @xmath5 was that the dependence on @xmath7 is only quadratic allowing for improvement on applications using large input vectors .    * the main result : * many applications of lll ( see the applications section below ) involve finding a vector in a lattice whose norm is known to be small in advance . in such cases it can be more efficient to reduce a basis of a sub - lattice which contains all targeted vectors than reducing a basis of the entire lattice . in this paper",
    "we target short vectors in specific types of input lattice bases which we call knapsack - type bases .",
    "the new algorithm introduces a search parameter @xmath8 which the user provides .",
    "this parameter is used to bound the norms of targeted short vectors . to be precise :",
    "the specifications of our algorithm are as follows .",
    "it takes as input a knapsack - type basis @xmath11 of a lattice @xmath12 with @xmath13 @xmath14 and a search parameter @xmath8 ; it returns a _ reduced basis generating a _ sub - lattice @xmath15 such that if @xmath16 and @xmath17 then @xmath18 .",
    "_ _         the schnhage algorithm is not widely implemented because of its impracticality . for most polynomials",
    ", @xmath19 is much smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "our main algorithm will reduce the all - coefficients matrix with a competitive practical running time , but constructing the matrix itself will require more hensel lifting than seems necessary in practice . in  @xcite a similar switch - complexity bound to section  [ psect ] is given on a more practical factoring algorithm .",
    "the problem of finding a minimal polynomial from an approximation of a complex root was attacked in  @xcite using lattice reduction techniques using knapsack - type bases . for an extensive treatment",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "[ algnumrecon ] suppose we know @xmath21 bits of precision of a complex root @xmath22 of an unknown irreducible polynomial , @xmath23 , where the degree of @xmath24 is @xmath25 and its maximal coefficient has absolute value @xmath26 .",
    "algorithm  [ mainalg ] can be used to find @xmath23 in @xmath27 cpu operations .",
    "this new complexity is an improvement over the @xmath5 algorithm which would use @xmath28 cpu operations to reduce the same lattice .",
    "although , one can prove a better switch - complexity with a two - column knapsack matrix by using  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lem .  2 ) to bound the determinant of the lattice as @xmath29 and thus the potential function from  @xcite is @xmath30 , leading to a switch complexity of @xmath31 ( posed as an open question in  @xcite ) . using this argument the complexity for @xmath5",
    "is reduced to @xmath32 .",

    "we thank damien stehl , nicolas brisebarre , and valrie berth for many helpful discussions .",
    "also ivan morel for introducing us to h - lll .",
    "this work was partially funded by the lareda project of the agence nationale de la recherche , it was also supported in part by a grant from the national science foundation .",
