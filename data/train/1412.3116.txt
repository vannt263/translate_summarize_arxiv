    "the detection of x - ray - emitting and -absorbing gas at zero redshift implies the existence of a diffuse volume - filling plasma associated with the milky way s interstellar medium ( ism ) and circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "detections of these absorption and emission lines along individual lines of sight imply plasma densities between @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath5 and plasma temperatures of @xmath17 k. these observations constrain the detailed properties of the gas along individual sightlines , but there has not been a comprehensive analysis on the global properties of the absorption and emission lines . analyzing the global properties of the observations",
    "is necessary to constrain the overall structure and extend of the gas .",
    "constraints on the structure of the gas , specifically the density profile , are necessary to estimate the hot gas mass within the milky way s virial radius . the contribution of the hot gas to the milky way s baryon budget may account for a significant fraction of the milky way s `` missing baryons '' .",
    "the tracers of the milky way s hot halo gas are and absorption and emission lines characteristic of gas in the 10@xmath18 - 10@xmath19 k range @xcite .",
    "the emission lines are thought to be a significant contributor to the 0.5 - 2.0 kev portion of the milky way s diffuse soft x - ray background ( sxrb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are typically seen in otherwise empty fields of view in the sky ( @xmath201000 sightlines ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorption lines are only seen in @xmath2030 bright active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and blazar spectra @xcite or x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of current x - ray telescopes in the soft x - ray band is the limiting factor on the number of absorption line detections , but still results in the nearly ubiquitous detection of the emission lines .",
    "the sxrb , with some contribution from and emission lines , has been observed in broadband images from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in blank - sky spectra from current x - ray telescopes @xcite , and with the diffuse x - ray spectrometer sounding rocket @xcite .",
    "a combination of results from analyses comparing the rass 1/4 kev and 3/4 kev bands @xcite and shadowing experiments toward nearby molecular clouds @xcite imply that multiple plasma components comprise the 0.5 - 2.0 kev component of the sxrb .",
    "the `` local '' emission component of the sxrb is believed to come from a combination of the local bubble ( lb ) and solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) processes .",
    "the lb is thought to be a supernova ( sn ) remnant that the sun is currently inside @xcite , although its physical and corresponding emission properties are debated in the literature .",
    "arguments exist either for the lb being filled with x - ray - emitting gas at @xmath17 k @xcite or that the emission comes more from a wall of material at the edges of the bubble ( 100 - 300 pc away ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , swcx emission is a known soft x - ray emission source where neutral hydrogen and helium atoms undergo charge exchange reactions with solar wind ions in and around our solar system @xcite .",
    "these reactions are difficult to predict or quantify , but are known to produce time - variable line emission at energies @xmath131 kev .",
    "while the details of both emission sources are still unclear , a combination of both swcx and lb emission models are necessary to reproduce the _ rosat _ 1/4 kev band emission @xcite .",
    "the picture at high energies , specifically for the and emission lines , has uncertainties as well .",
    "shadowing experiments toward nearby molecular clouds show that local emission is common , but emission is not always detected @xcite .",
    "it is clear the lb and/or swcx _ can _ produce and emission , but their global oxygen line emission properties are still unclear .",
    "the `` non - local '' plasma component of the sxrb is believed to come from a more extended , diffuse plasma at a slightly hotter temperature than the lb @xcite , although the source and exact spatial extent of the plasma is unclear .",
    "one potential source would be a plane - parallel , exponential distribution of @xmath17 k due to sn - driven outflows from the milky way s disk @xcite .",
    "indeed , this type of density distribution is suggested by @xcite based on and absorption line measurements along the pks 2155 - 304 sightline .",
    "they fit their absorption line observations with an exponential disk density model with a scale height of @xmath21 kpc , implying a much more confined medium compared to the diffuse , volume - filled halo picture .",
    "however , this type of distribution results in inconsistencies with additional `` non - local '' plasma observables , including the emission measure distribution across the sky of the `` non - local '' plasma @xcite and the milky way s diffuse x - ray surface brightness @xcite .",
    "this implies that the `` non - local '' plasma contribution to the sxrb , and thus the and emission lines , is likely from an extended distribution of gas in the milky way s halo .",
    "analyses of the and absorption lines typically assume that the lines arise from a large ( scales @xmath2220 kpc ) , diffuse , volume - filled halo consistent with shock heated gas at the milky way s virial temperature in quasi - static equilibrium @xcite .",
    "detailed work on the absorption strengths between and ( when detected ) along individual sightlines suggests a plasma temperature between log(@xmath23 ) = 6.1 - 6.4 , but do not provide constraints on the large - scale properties of the plasma .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite analyzed larger samples of the absorption lines using _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer and _ chandra _ high and low energy transmission grating data .",
    "@xcite compared their column densities to a single line of sight emission measurement @xcite while @xcite compared their column densities to an average emission measure from @xmath2020 lines of sight @xcite to estimate a characteristic density and path length of the absorbing material .",
    "there are several discrepancies between these works , but both find characteristic densities between @xmath24 and @xmath16 @xmath5 and path lengths @xmath2520 kpc .",
    "@xcite provided an improvement on these works by modeling the local absorption lines in 29 agn and x - ray binary spectra with a more physical hot halo density model ( as opposed to a constant - density sphere ) .",
    "they found the absorption lines could be modeled with a modified spherical @xmath2-model ( effectively a power law ) with @xmath2 ranging between 0.56 and 0.71 , depending on the effects of absorption line saturation ( @xmath2 = 0.5 corresponds to @xmath26 ) .",
    "these density model constraints resulted in hot gas mass estimates of @xmath27 within 200 kpc .",
    "until now , there has been no comprehensive comparison between the and emission and absorption line observations thought to be due to a galactic hot gas halo .",
    "this is partially due to the difficulty in disentangling the lb and hot halo contributions to the emission lines across the entire sky .",
    "the lb in particular is believed to be a stronger contribution to the emission lines than the absorption lines , thus further complicating any analysis .",
    "additionally , the differences in sample sizes between the two observables have prevented a large - scale analysis between the two .",
    "the number of absorption line measurements with current x - ray telescopes ( @xmath2030 ) is at its maximum due to the sensitivity of current detectors , while many published and emission line measurements are focused on individual sightlines or are limited to a certain region of the sky .",
    "this is important since the absorption and emission properties of the hot gas halo vary across the sky , meaning comparisons between absorption lines in one area of the sky with emission lines in a different area may yield incorrect results about the hot halo plasma .",
    "@xcite have offered a resolution to the latter issue by presenting an all - sky catalog of and emission line measurements of the sxrb using _ xmm - newton_/epic - mos data .",
    "their sample is an incredibly useful tool for probing the milky way s hot gas halo since there are many targets ( 1868 in their whole sample ) and their sample covers the entire sky",
    ". the combination of these two effects should provide improved constraints on the milky way s hot gas halo compared to the absorption line data sets , even with the known lb emission .    in this work ,",
    "we unify the procedure outlined in @xcite with this and emission line data set to constrain the density properties of the milky way s hot gas halo .",
    "we develop a parametric model for the milky way s hot gas halo density profile and lb , calculate model line intensities along each line of sight and for a given parameter set , and find the model parameters that are most consistent with the data . in this way",
    ", we constrain the density properties of the hot gas halo and place more precise estimates on important quantities such as its mass and metallicity .",
    "there are several advantages to this work on the and emission lines .",
    "the most critical benefit of this work is that we are analyzing the emission lines in the same way @xcite analyzed absorption lines .",
    "this is crucial since we expect the milky way s hot halo to contribute to both sets of observables , so any similarities or differences between the two results can tell us about the physical properties of the gas .",
    "the other main benefit is that the quality of our constraints using this emission line sample should be much improved compared to the absorption line constraints .",
    "this is largely due to the increase in sample size by a factor of @xmath120 .",
    "the outline for the rest of the paper is as follows . in section  [ section.data_reduction ]",
    ", we describe the observation selection , data reduction , and line measurement procedure of the and emission lines from @xcite . in section",
    "[ section.model_fitting ] , we describe our model fitting procedure .",
    "this includes a discussion of our parametric model and emission line calculation . in section  [ section.results ] ,",
    "we discuss our model fitting results and constraints on our density model . in section  [ section.discussion ]",
    ", we discuss the implications of our results and compare them with other studies on the milky way s hot gas halo . finally in section  [ section.summary ] ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "our emission line sample is a subset of the comprehensive and emission line sample from @xcite .",
    "the authors compiled their sample from all public _ xmm - newton _ observations prior to 2010 august 4 that contained any epic - mos exposure time ( 5698 observations ) .",
    "the goal of creating this sample was to analyze the various sources of the milky way s sxrb , including swcx , the lb , and the milky way s hot gas halo .",
    "our data set is a subset of the @xcite full sample that maximizes our sensitivity to the milky way s hot halo emission .",
    "this work focuses on the analysis and modeling of our subset of the emission lines presented in @xcite , not the line measurements or sample compilation itself .",
    "here we provide an overview of their procedure and refer the reader to the full sample references for a more detailed description of the sample @xcite .",
    "we describe their data selection and reduction procedure in section  [ subsection.data_filtering ] , their emission line measurement procedure in section  [ subsection.line_measurements ] , and our additional screening procedure to create our sample in section  [ subsection.our_screening ] .",
    "the 5698 archival _ xmm - newton _ observations were processed with the standard _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system version 11.0.1 , including the _ xmm - newton _ extended source analysis software ( _ xmm_-esas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ xmm_-esas script ` mos - filter ` was used to remove any observing time affected by soft - proton flaring .",
    "this contamination is identified by an excess or deficit in the 2.5 - 12 kev count rate .",
    "after this filtering , the authors kept observations with @xmath285 ks of good observing time and with at least one good exposure with the mos1 and mos2 cameras each .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 2611 observations out of the original 5698 .",
    "bright x - ray sources were removed from the observations using both visual inspection and automated source removal procedures .",
    "these screening methods are necessary to isolate sxrb emission in the extracted spectra .",
    "the authors used data from the second _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalog ( 2xmm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for automated x - ray point source removal . for each observation , any 2xmm source with 0.5 - 2.0",
    "kev flux @xmath29 erg @xmath30 s@xmath31 inside the field of view was removed using a 50@xmath32 circular region .",
    "these regions typically enclose @xmath190% of the sources fluxes .",
    "the authors also employed a visual inspection of the observations to remove any bright or extended sources that were not included in the automated point source removal .",
    "the exclusion regions for these sources typically ranged between 1@xmath33 and 4@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "swcx reactions are a known source of and line emission that must be accounted for in the emission line measurements .",
    "these reactions occur between solar wind ions and neutral hydrogen atoms in the earth s atmosphere ( geocoronal swcx ) or neutral hydrogen and helium atoms in the heliosphere ( heliospheric swcx ) .",
    "geocoronal swcx emission is strongest in the magnetosheath @xcite and often occurs at times when the solar wind proton flux is high @xcite .",
    "heliospheric swcx tends to be stronger near the ecliptic plane @xcite and varies with the overall solar cycle ( 11 yr ) .",
    "fortunately , techniques to reduce swcx emission to and emission line measurements exist @xcite .",
    "@xcite address several swcx filtering techniques in detail , but their primary approach utilizes solar wind proton flux data from omniweb .",
    "this database includes solar wind proton flux data from numerous satellites , including the _ advanced composition explorer _ and _ wind_. they reduce swcx contamination to the emission lines by removing portions of the _ xmm - newton _ data taken when the solar wind proton flux was greater than @xmath34 @xmath30 s@xmath31 .",
    "this filtering procedure caused the number of usable observations to fall from 2611 to 1435 due to some of the observations falling below the 5 ks observing time threshold mentioned above .",
    "the authors presented both their full sample of emission lines and this `` flux - filtered '' sample of emission lines that are less contaminated by swcx emission .",
    "figure  [ figure.map_filter ] shows the distribution of the flux - filtered sample on the sky and the corresponding emission line strengths .      in this section",
    ", we outline the emission line measurement procedure from @xcite .",
    "this includes fitting for all emission sources in a typical sxrb spectrum , including the emission lines of interest , the continuum of the lb and hot halo , the extragalactic background ( epl ) , the instrumental lines in the 0.4 - 10.0 kev range , and any residual soft proton contamination present after filtering out the quiescent particle background ( qpb ) .",
    "this entire measurement procedure used xspec version 12.7.0 .",
    "the authors fitted each observation in the 0.4 - 10.0 kev range with a multicomponent spectral model discussed above .",
    "the and emission line model consisted of two @xmath35-functions ( or gaussians with widths fixed to zero ) with the energy centroid left as a free parameter and the energy centroid fixed at 0.6536 kev ( from apec ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note that this line measurement method includes the total line emission from all sources in the extracted spectrum ( hot halo , lb , and any residual contamination ) .",
    "the galactic continuum included an absorbed apec thermal plasma model @xcite with the oxygen k@xmath36 emission disabled @xcite .",
    "the epl was modeled as an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1.46 @xcite .",
    "both the apec and epl components included attenuation by absorbing hi columns from the lab survey @xcite using the xspec ` phabs ` model @xcite .",
    "the apec and ` phabs ` components assumed @xcite abundances .",
    "the model included two gaussians for the al - k and si - k instrumental lines in this energy range @xcite . the final model component included a power law ( not folded through the instrumental response ) to account for residual soft proton contamination from the qpb @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide a detailed discussion of the assumptions made in the above model and how these assumptions relate to the uncertainties presented in their results . here",
    "we highlight those that affect the uncertainties of the emission line measurements .",
    "the statistical errors of the emission line measurements come from the standard xspec ` error ` command .",
    "the authors also provide a systematic uncertainty estimate based on the type of thermal plasma model used and variation in the epl normalization parameter .",
    "the former compares the original line intensity measurements assuming an apec thermal plasma model with measurements assuming a @xcite or @xcite model ( see equation ( 1 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "the latter accounts for sightline - to - sightline variation in the epl normalization parameter due to variable soft proton contamination and/or unresolved sources with @xmath37 < @xmath38 erg @xmath30 s@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the total systematic error for each observation is the combination of these two estimates in quadrature .",
    "the final filtering procedure discussed in @xcite applies a more restrictive constraint on residual soft proton contamination to the emission line measurements .",
    "the authors introduced the ratio between the total 2 - 5 kev band flux ( @xmath39 ) and the epl flux in the same energy band ( @xmath40 ) as a quantitative measure of residual soft proton contamination to the count rates @xcite .",
    "any observations where this ratio was greater than 2.7 were rejected from the sample .",
    "this decreased the number of useful observations from 2611 to 1868 for their full sample and from 1435 to 1003 for their flux - filtered sample .",
    "we apply additional screening methods to the data in order to produce a sample that is most sensitive to the milky way s hot halo emission .",
    "these are spatial screening methods where we discard observations that are located near possible contaminates to the and emission lines .",
    "these include bright x - ray sources in the sky and any galactic features that show evidence for enhanced soft x - ray emission ( see table  [ table.screening_catalogs ] for a summary ) . although @xcite account for a range of point source removal methods in their data reduction procedure ( see section  [ subsection.data_filtering ] ) , this additional screening is designed to provide a cleaner sample of milky way hot halo emission .",
    "our automated screening discards any observations within 0.5@xmath41 ( or within the _ xmm - newton _ field of view ) of sources that could produce soft x - rays , thus complicating the or emission line measurement .",
    "we utilize several all - sky catalogs that cover a range of astrophysical objects to generate a potential contaminating source list .",
    "the final contaminating source list is a subset of the objects in these catalogs based on either direct or inferred x - ray brightness cuts .",
    "for example , for _ rosat _ bright source catalog objects we include sources with fluxes > 1 counts s@xmath31 , but for principal galaxy catalog objects , which do not have observed x - ray fluxes , we include sources with sizes > 10@xmath33 .",
    "this does not create a completely uniform list of different types of x - ray - emitting objects and their fluxes , but it does provide a general list of objects that could contaminate the or emission line measurement .",
    "we also discard observations by hand that are known galactic x - ray features and that are not discarded by our automated screening procedure outlined above .",
    "we remove any observations within @xmath42 of the galactic plane to reduce emission from sne in the milky way s disk @xcite .",
    "this region also contains the largest hi columns that attenuate hot halo line emission , thus making the de - absorbed emission line intensities more uncertain .",
    "we also remove observations within @xmath43 and @xmath44 , or near the fermi bubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear how the bubbles have impacted the milky way s hot gas halo , but there are signatures of the bubbles in x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "the observations that pass through these regions will be part of a separate study .",
    "finally , we remove a cluster of observations near the large magellanic cloud and small magellanic cloud .    after our additional screening criteria discussed above ,",
    "we are left with 649 of the 1003 observations from the flux - filtered sample .",
    "figure  [ figure.map_spacecut ] shows the distribution of our screened sample on the sky with the corresponding and emission line strengths .",
    "other than the galactic plane and fermi bubble regions , our screened sample has similar sky coverage compared to the original all - sky samples .",
    "this sub - sample of observations should contain minimal emission from sources other than the lb and milky way hot halo and serves as our working sample of observations in our model fitting procedure .",
    "here we describe how we compare the emission line observations from @xcite with simulated line intensities from a parametric density model for the milky way s hot gas halo .",
    "the goal of this work is to explore our model parameter space and find the set of parameters that is most consistent with the observations . this way we constrain the density profile of the milky way s hot gas halo with the same approach as previous studies on absorption lines @xcite .",
    "we consider various forms of a spherical @xmath2-model to represent the milky way s hot gas halo density profile .",
    "we choose this model because of its success in fitting x - ray surface brightness profiles around early- @xcite and late - type @xcite galaxies and to be consistent with previous work on the milky way s hot halo @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-model is defined as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the central density , @xmath47 is the core radius , and @xmath2 defines the slope of the profile at large radii .",
    "typical values for @xmath2 range between 0.4 and 1.0 while typical core radii are @xmath13 5 kpc .",
    "the typical observed values for the core radii parameter combined with our removal of observations near the galactic center limit our ability to simultaneously constrain all three parameters of the @xmath2-model . out of the 649 pointings in our sample",
    "discussed above , only 4 pass within 5 kpc of the galactic center . following the work of @xcite , we adopt a modified @xmath2-model in the limit where @xmath48 :    @xmath49    this modified density profile is essentially a power law with a normalization of @xmath50 and slope of -3@xmath2 .",
    "we use this two - dimensional hot gas halo density profile for the majority of our analysis .",
    "we also consider a flattened hot gas halo density profile in our analysis by modifying the spherical @xmath2-model .",
    "a flattened density profile would be a natural consequence of the milky way s rotation .",
    "if the hot gas halo traces the dark matter ( dm ) distribution and the dm distribution is flattened due to rotation , one expects some flattening of the hot gas density profile @xcite .",
    "the flattened @xmath2-model becomes    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the radius in the plane of the milky way s disk and height off the galactic plane , respectively , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the core radii in those directions .",
    "we infer a flattening of the density profile based on the ratio between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we have to model all other known sources of and line emission ( e.g. , the lb and residual swcx ) simultaneously with our hot halo density model .",
    "this is because the observed emission lines contain the total emission from all these sources and because the sources may produce emission line strengths comparable to one another .",
    "however , we emphasize that the goal of this work is to understand properties of the milky way s hot gas halo , not the lb or swcx .",
    "we thus develop a parametric model for the lb ( similar to the hot gas halo ) , but we do not claim this parameterization to be the correct physical interpretation for the lb . this still parameterizes the _ emission _ properties of the lb , which is necessary for correctly interpreting the hot gas halo emission .",
    "we model any emission not due to the milky way s hot halo as a volume - filled , constant - density lb .",
    "the density and temperature along every sightline is assumed to be the same while the path length of the lb ranges between @xmath1100 - 300 pc depending on the direction of the observation .",
    "these path lengths come from absorption line measurements of 1005 nearby ( @xmath13350 pc ) stars @xcite .",
    "figures 4 - 6 in @xcite show contours separating local ionized and neutral gas , or equivalently defining an lb edge .",
    "the contours show a variety of substructure associated with the lb , although there is a general shape defining the ionized gas region . in our analysis",
    ", we parameterize the lb edges with a geometrical model to approximately match the contours discussed above .",
    "this implies that the lb emission varies by a factor of @xmath203 , depending on the observed direction .",
    "we note this parameterization may not accurately represent the physical properties of the lb , specifically the constant - density and volume - filled assumptions .",
    "there are reports indicating that the lb is better described as a `` cavity '' where the emission comes from a wall of material with little emission from diffuse , volume - filling material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , other works have modeled the lb x - ray emission properties assuming that the bubble is filled with a diffuse plasma along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "differentiating between these scenarios is beyond the scope of this work since this simple parameterization still characterizes the x - ray emission of the lb with some physical motivation .",
    "all and line emissivities come from atomdb version 2.0.2 @xcite .",
    "the line emissivities assume an apec thermal plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) at a given temperature @xcite .",
    "we initially assume that the halo and lb plasmas are isothermal with temperatures of log(@xmath56 ) = 6.3 and log(@xmath57 ) = 6.1 , resulting in and line emissivities ( in units of photons @xmath58 s@xmath31 ) of @xmath59 ( halo ) = @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( halo ) = @xmath62 , @xmath59 ( lb ) = @xmath63 , and @xmath61 ( lb ) = @xmath64 .",
    "note that the line emissivities quoted here include the resonance , forbidden , and intercombination lines since the observed emission lines are unresolved .",
    "we assume that the hot gas halo is a constant - temperature plasma in cie with fixed log(@xmath56 ) = 6.3 . the strongest observational evidence for the hot gas halo being isothermal comes from modeling the 0.5 - 2.0 kev spectra of the sxrb for a large number of sightlines .",
    "@xcite analyzed 110 observations of the sxrb based on a subset of the observations from @xcite .",
    "their spectral fitting routine was similar to the line measurement procedure above , except they fit the spectra with thermal plasma models for the hot gas halo instead of measuring the individual and line intensities .",
    "this resulted in hot gas halo emission measures and temperatures for a subsample of the @xcite observations .",
    "the primary benefit of this approach is the ability to fit for the hot gas halo emission measure and temperature separately from the lb , as opposed to the emission lines that include all emission sources .",
    "the drawback to this spectral fitting technique is that one requires more counts to constrain the plasma properties as opposed to just the emission line surface brightnesses , thus requiring more exposure time per observation .",
    "we note that @xcite discuss an in - preparation study indicating the emission measure and line intensity observations are generally consistent with each other .",
    "furthermore , the sample analyzed in @xcite is subjected to stronger temporal and spatial screening criteria than the @xcite sample that limit the sample s sky coverage .",
    "thus , the significant increase in sample size and sky coverage of the emission line measurements compared to the emission measure / temperature measurements imply the former are better suited for this study .",
    "this study still found that the hot halo temperature showed little variation with a median of @xmath65 k with an interquartile range of @xmath66 k ( we discuss their emission measure results in section  [ subsection.previous_work_obs ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with previous temperature estimates of the hot gas halo from its emission properties @xcite , thus validating this assumption .",
    "as discussed above , we also assume that the lb is a constant - temperature plasma in cie with fixed log(@xmath57 ) = 6.1 .",
    "similar to our constant - density parameterization , this assumption is also debated in the literature .",
    "@xcite conducted a shadowing experiment toward the nearby molecular cloud mbm12 to constrain the and line emission due the lb .",
    "they found that the ratio of the emission line strengths implied an lb plasma temperature of @xmath67 k. however , recent work also implies that the lb may not be in cie and that non - equilibrium ionization effects can change the interpretation of lb observations @xcite .",
    "although departures from cie are crucial for understanding the physical properties of the lb , the work by @xcite motivates our temperature assumption given our model parameterization .",
    "there has been growing evidence for optical depth effects associated with the milky way s hot halo plasma .",
    "this has been a difficult effect to quantify since both the emission and absorption lines are unresolved , making direct measurements of the linewidths impossible .",
    "the best evidence for optical depth effects in the plasma comes from weak detections of @xmath68 absorption lines in several qso spectra @xcite .",
    "these works imply optical depths ranging between @xmath1 0.1 - 2.0 depending on the doppler width assumed for the lines , whether one is observing or , and which direction one observes @xcite .",
    "these optical depth estimates mean assuming that the plasma is optically thin ( which is often an implicit assumption ) may be incorrect . to estimate the optical depth corrections , we calculate line intensities both in the optically thin limit and assuming a doppler width of @xmath69 = 150 km s@xmath31 .",
    "this doppler width is characteristic of the hydrogen sound speed at this temperature and is consistent with simulations of halo gas @xcite .",
    "the doppler width is necessary for calculating the absorption cross section of the line transitions ( see below ) . since these effects are difficult to quantify , we present results both by calculating emission lines in the optically thin limit and by accounting for optical depth corrections .",

    "we intend to examine this region in more detail in the future , but the quality of our fit results and density model constraints with its removal from the sample indicates that the observations are well described by our model .",
    "we allow the hot gas halo size to vary as a free parameter to estimate the minimum size halo necessary to still be consistent with the observations .",
    "initially , we calculate line intensities assuming a halo size of 250 kpc , but our line intensity calculation becomes less sensitive at larger galactocentric radii due to the decrease in density . in other words ,",
    "our model line intensity values do not change much once we integrate past a line of sight distance of @xmath150 kpc .",
    "when we allow the halo size to vary , we find nearly identical posterior probability distributions for the original model parameters .",
    "the distribution for the halo size is not a well - defined gaussian like the other parameters , but instead is a flat distribution between 15 and 250 kpc .",
    "thus , we find a minimum halo size of @xmath115 kpc .",
    "this size scale is consistent with a large , extended gas distribution , rather than a compact disk morphology .",
    "@xcite also found similar minimum halo sizes of 32 kpc and 18 kpc at the 95% and 99% confidence levels from a similar analysis of absorption lines .",
    "similar to the work by @xcite , we had trouble fitting a flattened density model to the observations .",
    "this is likely due to the inferred vales for @xmath123 and @xmath55 ( @xmath131 kpc ) and our lack of observations near the galactic center .",
    "the only way we can constrain @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the flattened model is by limiting the explored parameter space of the other free parameters in our model .",
    "we employ boundaries of 0.01 - 0.50 @xmath5 for @xmath124 , 0.3 - 0.8 for @xmath2 , and 0.0 - 0.1 for @xmath103 in our mcmc analysis while @xmath54 and @xmath55 are left to explore their full parameter space .",

    "the orthogonal core radii are consistent with each other based on their 1@xmath87 uncertainties , indicating that a flattened density profile is not an improvement over our spherical density model .",
    "the hot gas halo density parameters have much tighter constraints than the lb density parameter when we fit the emission lines .",
    "furthermore , the lb density parameter is consistent with zero , implying that there is little emission due to the lb .",
    "this is seen in our marginalized posterior probability distributions ( figure  [ figure.chains ] ) and joint probability distributions ( figure  [ figure.contours ] ) for fitting the lines with an optically thin hot halo plasma .",
    "this is a somewhat self - imposed constraint based on our temperature assumption for the lb .",
    "the line emissivity for the lb is @xmath150 times weaker than the halo line emissivity .",
    "however , the lb density parameter would be much larger if there was a global contribution to the emission lines from the lb .",
    "the fact that the lb density parameter does not compensate for the relatively small line emissivity implies that the lb has little contribution to the .",
    "this means the emission lines are effectively fit with just our hot halo model , making them a good tracer of halo gas .",
    "the emission line observations show very different fitting results compared to the observations .",
    "our fitting procedure does find optimal parameters to reproduce the data , but our best - fit model finds a @xmath117 ( dof ) = 4.69 ( 645 ) for the observations compared to 1.08 ( 644 ) for the observations .",
    "figure  [ figure.obs_vs_mod_o7 ] shows an analog of figure  [ figure.obs_vs_mod ] , but for our best - fit optically thin plasma model compared to the observations . while the constraints on the fitted parameters are comparable to the fitting results ( even significantly better for @xmath103 ) , the quality of our fit implies that the observations are not well described by our parametric model .",
    "following the approach of @xcite on absorption lines , we fit the emission line observations with the inclusion of an additional uncertainty to the observations ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the purpose of this approach is to add the smallest uncertainty to the measurements ( @xmath126 is added in quadrature with the statistical and systematic uncertainties ) while also finding an acceptable model fit to the data . in this way , @xmath126 is a crude estimate of the sightline - to - sightline variation or a way to quantify the deviation of the observations from our ideal density model .",

    "the source of this variation and its relation to the differences between our and fitting results are discussed in section  [ subsection.discrepancy ] .",
    "optical depth corrections in our line intensity calculation have a subtle , yet important imprint on our model fitting results .",
    "regardless of whether or not we analyze and , applying optical depth corrections to our intensity calculation increases both our fitted halo normalization parameter and @xmath2 .",
    "this is likely due to the absorption term dominating the scattering term in equation ( [ eq.transfer_optical_depth ] ) . for a given model parameter",
    "set , the absorption term causes the calculated line intensity along a given line of sight to be smaller than the optically thin calculation ( i.e. , some photons are absorbed along the line of sight ) .",
    "this explains the increase in the halo normalization parameter since more photons must be created everywhere in the halo to account for these absorbed photons and still reproduce the observations .",
    "but the absorption term @xmath127 , implying that denser gas regions are more susceptible to this effect .",
    "this explains the increase ( or steepening ) of the fitted @xmath2 parameter since regions closer to the galactic center need to generate more photons compared to the outer regions of the halo to reproduce the observations .",
    "this qualitative argument explains the behavior we see in our fit results , but we need to quantify this effect to constrain the true halo gas density profile .",
    "we evaluate these optical depth corrections quantitatively by comparing the true and fitted @xmath2 parameters if the true plasma accounts for optical depth corrections , but we assume that the plasma is optically thin . given a true model parameter set , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we simulate 160 emission line observations randomly distributed across the sky accounting for optical depth effects .",
    "we then fit the simulated observations assuming the plasma is optically thin .",
    "this gives us an estimate of how much the optical depth corrections actually effect our fit parameters .",
    "figure  [ figure.beta_map ] shows the results of this procedure for a true halo normalization of @xmath130 @xmath5 kpc@xmath6 and a range of @xmath129 .",
    "one sees if we assume the plasma is optically thin , our inferred @xmath2 would be smaller ( shallower ) than @xmath129 .",
    "the strength of this effect depends on @xmath129 , but the observed @xmath2 ranges between 80% and 95% of @xmath129 .",
    "this is consistent with the differences we see in our own fit results .    at this point",
    "it is difficult to assess the accuracy of these optical depth corrections , even with the estimation procedure above .",
    "this is because finding solutions to the transfer equation is inherently an iterative process .",
    "we assumed in the above calculations that our single calculation of the mean intensity for a given halo parameterization is an accurate representation of the true radiation field everywhere in the halo .",
    "this is not necessarily the case when accounting for multiple photon scatterings , assumptions on the turbulence of the medium , etc .",
    "future work will involve developing a monte carlo radiative transfer code designed for this system so we can more accurately estimate these effects .",
    "however , our calculation above is consistent with our expected scenario where optical depth corrections are largest toward denser regions of the halo ( near the galactic center ) .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit parameters are consistent with each other at the 1@xmath87 level with and without optical depth corrections .",
    "this enhances our argument that we can indeed constrain the true density profile of the milky way s hot gas halo .",

    "these estimates are more tightly constrained if we only consider our fitting results , which reproduce the data much better than our fitting results .",
    "the characteristic masses have a range of @xmath135 within 50 kpc and @xmath136 within 250 kpc in this case .",

    "this implies that if our best - fit hot halo density profile extends to the @xmath111 , it contains a significant amount of mass compared to the other baryons in the milky way but does not account for all of the milky way s `` missing baryons '' .",
    "it is possible our hot gas density profile extends past @xmath111 , thus increasing our mass estimates . in particular , we estimate how far our density profile would need to extend to account for all the milky way s missing baryons .",
    "the milky way s virial mass , the other known baryonic mass components ( excluding the hot gas mass ) , and the cosmological baryon fraction discussed above imply a missing baryon mass of @xmath143 . given the range of assumptions made above for our hot gas mass estimates above ( gas metallicity , mass uncertainties , etc . ) , our halo would need to extend between 3 and 5 @xmath111 to account for all of the milky way s missing baryons ( * ? ? ?",

    "the hot mass estimates quoted in table  [ table.mcmc_results ] all assume a gas metallicity of 0.3 @xmath131 based on pulsar dispersion measurements toward the lmc .",

    "here we define the dispersion measure as    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the distance to the source and @xmath146 is the density profile along the line of sight .",

    "after accounting for dm contributions from the milky way s disk and from the lmc itself , they estimated a dm for the milky way s hot halo of 23 @xmath5 pc ( @xcite conducted a similar analysis and found similar results ) .",
    "integrating our optically thin halo gas model in the lmc direction ( @xmath70 = 273.57@xmath41 , -32.08@xmath41 ) yields a dm of 8.2 @xmath5 pc . however , the calculated dm @xmath147 @xmath148 and the line emissivity values used in our analysis assumed @xcite solar abundances , or equivalently a solar metallicity .",
    "this means that we match the hot halo dm estimate from @xcite if we assume a halo gas metallicity of @xmath149 = 0.3 @xmath131 .",

    "the cooling radius is a potential constraint on the inner radius to our halo profile since for @xmath154 13.6 gyr for @xmath155 , implying that the halo gas would be in a cooler phase at this point in the milky way s evolution in the absence of additional heating sources .",

    "flatten for @xmath160 because we calculate the _ current _ mass accretion rate . in this case , regions where @xmath161 13.6 gyr have not had time to cool at this point .",
    "these results imply that the hot gas halo loses between 0.08 and 0.50 @xmath162 yr@xmath31 in the inner regions of the halo as the gas cools .",
    "the upper limits of these accretion rates are similar to simulated accretion rates of halo gas around milky way analogs @xcite .",
    "the upper limits here also imply accretion of halo gas may be an important contributor to the milky way s current star formation rate ( sfr ) , observed to be between 0.68 and 1.45 @xmath162 yr@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite modeled the mass - loss rates and star formation histories for a sample of galaxies ( including the milky way ) to examine if recycled gas from stellar mass loss could sustain observed levels of star formation in the galaxies .",
    "they concluded that mass loss from later stages of stellar evolution could provide most of the fuel required to produce the observed milky way sfr .",

    "this is another indication that the halo gas metallicity is sub - solar , with @xmath149 = 0.3 @xmath131 being a limit that satisfies numerous observational constraints .",
    "our primary comparison with previous work on the milky way s hot gas halo follows the work by @xcite on absorption lines in qso spectra .",
    "other works on different observations with different analyses will be addressed , but we focus on this work since the procedure for fitting and analyzing the absorption lines in @xcite is identical to our work . both of these works model the observations with a hot gas halo model defined by a modified @xmath2-model ( equation ( [ eq.beta_model_approx ] ) ) .",
    "the obvious difference between these works is the type of observation analyzed , column densities / equivalent widths ( @xmath170 ) in @xcite compared to / emission line intensities ( @xmath171 ) here .",
    "the physical differences between the absorption and emission line density scalings imply that the similarities or differences between the results tell us about the structure of the hot gas halo .",
    "the model fitting results from @xcite yielded hot gas halo structural parameters of @xmath172 = @xmath173 @xmath5 kpc@xmath6 , @xmath2 = @xmath174 , @xmath175 ( dof ) = 31.0 ( 26 ) assuming an optically thin plasma and @xmath172 = @xmath176 @xmath5 kpc@xmath6 , @xmath2 = @xmath177 , @xmath175 ( dof ) = 26.0 ( 27 ) accounting for saturation of the absorption lines . both of these results include added uncertainties to the equivalent width observations of 7.5 and 7.2 m  for the optically thin and optical depth correction cases to find acceptable @xmath175 values .",
    "there are several important comparisons to make between these absorption line results and our fit results from the emission lines in table  [ table.mcmc_results ] .",
    "we point out that the uncertainties on the absorption line fit parameters are much larger than any of our emission line fitting results .",
    "this is likely due to the sample size for the emission lines being @xmath120 times larger than the absorption line sample . even with the relatively small uncertainties on the emission line fit results , the fit parameters are consistent with each other based on their 1@xmath87 uncertainties .",
    "this consistency applies when comparing the optically thin results separately from the optical depth corrected results .",
    "the only exception is the emission line result with optical depth corrections , where we report a shallower @xmath2 ( 0.47@xmath1250.01 ) than the absorption line results .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to a combination of our treatment of optical depth corrections ( for both the absorption and emission lines ) and the overall variation we see in the emission lines .",
    "the fact that the model fitting results are consistent with each other allows us to compare additional quantities based on our halo models .",
    "we provide an additional estimate of the halo gas metallicity ( or oxygen abundance ) independent from the lmc pulsar dispersion measure constraint .",
    "this estimate utilizes the ratio between the absorption and emission line density profile results . the absorption lines / column densities probe @xmath178 , where @xmath179 = 0.5 is the ion fraction and @xmath180 is the oxygen density profile . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission lines are sensitive to @xmath181 or @xmath182 since @xmath183 ( see equation ( [ eq.intensity_thin ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the ratio between the absorption and emission line density profiles is a direct estimate of the gas metallicity distribution , @xmath184 . here",
    ", we take the optically thin electron density distribution from @xcite and convert it to an oxygen density distribution using a solar oxygen abundance of log@xmath185 = 8.74 from @xcite . for the hydrogen density profile",
    ", we use our optically thin model fitting results in table  [ table.mcmc_results ] and assume @xmath186 ( note the results in table  [ table.mcmc_results ] are for electron densities ) . when we divide these two density profiles , we find a weak halo gas metallicity gradient of approximately @xmath187 with a metallicity of @xmath188 @xmath131 ( 1@xmath87 ) at 10 kpc for @xcite solar abundances .",
    "these results are also consistent with the pulsar dispersion measure gas metallicity constraint of @xmath149 @xmath150 0.3 @xmath131 discussed in section  [ subsection.mw_implications ] .",
    "the most important quantity we compare between this work and the @xcite results is the hot gas mass profile .",
    "in addition to the best - fit model results in this paper , figures  [ figure.density ] and  [ figure.mass ] show the density and mass curves from @xcite assuming an optically thin plasma ( red shaded area ) . like the best - fit parameters , the total mass estimates within @xmath111 are consistent with each other based on the 1@xmath87 uncertainties .",
    "this implies characteristic hot gas halo masses of @xmath189 @xmath162 within @xmath111 regardless if one analyzes the emission or absorption lines .",
    "we compare these mass estimates and underlying density profiles with other independent absorption line studies on the milky way s hot gas halo .",
    "the comparisons here are limited since previous work on the x - ray absorption lines has either been confined to individual sightlines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or compared an ensemble of absorption lines with individual or small samples of emission line measurements @xcite .",
    "the latter implies that results on the aggregate absorber properties may not be consistent with the aggregate emission properties while the former results are only valid for individual lines of sight .",
    "examples of detailed analyses of local x - ray and absorption include @xcite , who analyzed the lmc x-3 sightline , and @xcite , who analyzed the pks 2155 - 304 sightline .",
    "both studies assume the absorbers are due to a local galactic disk density model and fit their observations with scale heights of @xmath12 kpc .",
    "these result in mass estimates of @xmath190 , significantly lower than our expected values . however , these exponential disk models tend to overproduce the milky way s x - ray surface brightness profile @xcite , whereas our results are consistent with this constraint .",
    "alternatively , the analyses by @xcite and @xcite assume that the absorption lines come from a more extended hot gas halo medium .",
    "@xcite compared the aggregate column densities of 26 high s / n local absorbers with a single emission measure estimate for the milky way s hot halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite took a similar approach , but they used a smaller sample of absorption lines ( 8 targets ) and an average hot halo emission measure from multiple sxrb observations distributed across the sky ( 14 measurements from @xcite and 26 measurements from @xcite ) .",
    "both works characterize the milky way s hot gas halo as a constant density sphere of size @xmath115 by comparing an average column density ( @xmath170 ) with an average emission measure ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the two studies disagree , though , where @xcite find @xmath191 @xmath5 , @xmath115 = 20 kpc , @xmath192 and @xcite find @xmath193 @xmath5 , @xmath194 139 kpc , @xmath195 .",
    "the differences come from a number of effects , including the measurement procedure of the equivalent widths and the conversion between equivalent widths and column densities .",
    "regardless of these differences , the constant density sphere models used in these works are not physically motivated .",
    "one expects the gas density to decrease with distance away from the milky way s center if it is approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium with the milky way s dm distribution .",
    "we emphasize the benefit of our procedure since we analyze the x - ray emission and absorption lines assuming the same type of density distribution that decreases with galactocentric radius .",
    "similar to absorption line studies on the milky way s hot gas halo , we also compare our results to studies focusing exclusively on the hot gas halo emission properties .",
    "these works also range from detailed analyses of the sxrb on individual sightlines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to analyses on the global emission properties of the sxrb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our work offers an improvement over these previous works since we are using the largest data set to date to characterize the line emission properties of the hot gas halo with a physical model .",
    "we nonetheless compare our results as a consistency check with previous work .    as simple consistency checks , we compare our best - fit model line intensities and emission measures to measured values along individual sightlines .",

    "this implies that our computed model em broadly comports with the observed value and does not overproduce the non - local emission in this region of the sky .",
    "while this is only one individual line of sight observation against which we compare our model , our work is designed to characterize the global properties of the hot halo component of the sxrb .",
    "there have been limited studies on the emission properties of the milky way s hot gas halo using a large sample of sightlines .",
    "these works typically follow a similar fitting procedure to that outlined in section  [ subsection.line_measurements ] , except one fits the spectrum with two apec models for the lb and hot gas halo emission components . @xcite",
    "analyzed sxrb spectra in nine fields of view with _ suzaku _ , but limited their sky coverage to 65@xmath200 .",
    "although this sample presents limited sky coverage , they report a range of hot halo em values between @xmath201 @xmath197 pc .",
    "@xcite presented a similar analysis on 110 _ xmm - newton _ observations , but also limited their observation selection to @xmath202 ( among other selection criteria ) .",

    "we have shown in the above discussion our model fitting results are generally consistent with previous observational results on the local x - ray absorption and emission line observations .",
    "the methods in previous works range from detailed studies on individual sightlines to analyzing the global properties of either the emission or absorption lines in question .",
    "the physical interpretation of the emission and absorption lines also ranges from a compact exponential disk of hot gas material to more extended distributions .",
    "we have attempted to unify this picture by analyzing both a large sample of emission and absorption line observations independently , but with the same model fitting procedure . with these comparisons",
    ", we have shown that our modified @xmath2-model for an extended hot gas halo density profile can describe both the emission and absorption line observations , but is also broadly consistent with previous independent projects on the various types of observations .",
    "we compare our hot gas density model results with simulations of isolated milky - way - sized halos . specifically , we focus on simulations designed to analyze hot diffuse halo gas in the galaxies .",
    "there are many details to compare between our parametric model results and these simulations , but here we compare the most basic properties of the halo gas : the density estimates at different radii , the mass contained in hot gas , and the gas metallicity .",
    "our best - fit halo density model is consistent with recent simulations on the local group system .",
    "@xcite analyzed the distribution of all gas phases in a suite of simulations of the local group as part of the constrained local universe simulations project .",
    "figure  [ figure.nuza ] shows our best - fit halo density profile compared to their hot gas ( @xmath207 k ) density profile for the milky way analog .",
    "even though their simulations show some variation ( the gray shaded region represents density profile estimates from random viewing angles of their simulated galaxy ) , the two density profiles are remarkably similar for @xmath208 kpc .",
    "the discrepancy within @xmath150 kpc is likely due to feedback mechanisms within the galactic disk and contributions from gas @xmath209 k. this recent result indicates that the structure of our model hot gas halo is qualitatively similar to current simulations .",
    "we compare our best - fit halo mass estimates within @xmath111 to hot gas halo simulations .",
    "these simulations are all designed to analyze different aspects of their host galaxies , but typically estimate hot gas masses with a range of 10@xmath210 - 10@xmath211 @xmath162 .",
    "for example , the @xcite simulations discussed above were designed to analyze gas properties in the local group medium and report hot gas masses between @xmath212 and @xmath213 within @xmath111 of their milky way analog .",
    "another example by @xcite utilized the moving - mesh code ` arepo ` to analyze the relationship between stellar feedback processes and diffuse gas in galaxies .",
    "they report a wider range of warm plus hot gas masses between 10@xmath210 - 10@xmath211 @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath214-body simulations from @xcite focused specifically on the hot gas mass contained within @xmath111 of milky - way - type galaxies and found hot gas masses comparable to the stellar masses of the host galaxies ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "this result is qualitatively similar with our hot gas mass estimates compared to the milky way s stellar mass . in an entirely different approach , @xcite used hydrodynamical simulations to analyze cosmic rays scattering off the milky way s hot gas halo and their observational signatures in the diffuse gamma - ray background @xcite .",
    "they report gas masses of [ 0.2 , 1.0 , 3.5 ] @xmath216 for @xmath74 = [ 50 , 100 , 200 ] kpc .",
    "these results indicate that our best - fit model hot gas mass estimates between @xmath217 and @xmath218 within 250 kpc are consistent with current simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "our lower limit on the halo gas metallicity of @xmath1500.3 @xmath131 is consistent with simulations as well .",
    "the halo gas metallicity tends to have more variation in the literature depending on the simulation and the investigated galaxy evolution properties ( typically feedback mechanisms ) . for example , hydrodynamical simulations analyzing hot gas halos as shock - heated material accreted on the dm potential wells of their galaxies favor sub - solar halo gas metallicities of @xmath130.5 @xmath131 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xcite simulations discussed above were designed to analyze stellar feedback properties on the hot gas .",
    "these results predict a metallicity gradient in the halo gas starting @xmath201 @xmath131 near the galaxy disk and dropping below @xmath200.3 @xmath131 for @xmath219 kpc .",
    "the lower limit we place on the milky way s halo gas metallicity of @xmath1500.3 @xmath131 implies a minimal level of enrichment from the milky way s disk .",
    "we have presented an in - depth analysis of the milky way s sxrb using the largest sample of and emission lines to date .",
    "our sample is a subset of the work by @xcite , who presented and emission line measurements of the sxrb from _ xmm - newton _ archival data .",
    "we applied additional observation screening methods to their sample to maximize our sensitivity to emission from the milky way s hot gas halo .",
    "these screening methods left us with 649 out of 1003 observations from the @xcite flux - filtered sample covering all regions of the sky outside the galactic center and galactic plane .",
    "the combination of the size and sky coverage of this sample allows us to constrain the physical properties of the milky way s hot gas halo much better than previous works .",
    "the advantage of this work over previous studies on the sxrb is that our model fitting procedure to the emission lines is identical to the work by @xcite on absorption lines .",
    "this is critical since the both types of observations are likely due to the same plasma sources in the milky way ( although the different sources are expected to have different strengths in absorption and emission ) .",
    "thus , this work is a positive step toward unifying the absorption and emission line observations associated with the milky way s ism / cgm .",
    "we find an acceptable fit to the observations with a diffuse volume - filled hot gas halo model described as a modified @xmath2-model ( a power law ) .",
    "our best - fit fitting results depend on whether we account for optical depth effects in the plasma , but we constrain @xmath2 to be between 0.50 and 0.54 without and with these corrections .",
    "we also include a simple parameterization for lb emission in our model , but its contribution to the emission lines is negligible ( @xmath130.02 l.u . ) and it is unconstrained by the observations .",
    "the observations show considerably different behavior than the observations , both in the quality of our best - fit models and in the best - fit parameters themselves .",
    "the best - fit @xmath2 parameter is consistently smaller ( shallower ) when we analyze the observations compared to the observations .",
    "this is possibly due to departures from an isothermal halo profile assumed in the analysis .",
    "this interpretation is speculative however , since our best - fit parameters to the observations yield unacceptable @xmath220 ( dof ) = 4.7 ( 645 ) .",
    "this implies there is significant sightline - to - sightline variation in the observations that deviate the observations from our smooth hot halo + lb emission model .      1 .   the model fitting results are consistent with previous work on absorption lines utilizing the same model fitting procedure @xcite",
    "the fact these results are consistent with each other implies we are starting to develop a cohesive picture of the milky way s hot gas halo structure .",
    "specifically , this result is a positive step toward unifying the emission and absorption line observations that are due to the milky way s hot gas halo .",
    "the inferred mass from our best - fit hot gas halo parameters ranges between @xmath136 within 250 kpc .",
    "this mass is considerable when compared to the known baryon mass in the milky way ( @xmath137 ) , but is 6 - 10 times smaller than the missing baryon mass in the milky way .",
    "3 .   several computed quantities from our best - fit model results suggest a gas metallicity of 0.3 @xmath131 .",
    "the halo gas metallicity must be @xmath1500.3 @xmath131 to not overproduce the residual pulsar dm toward the lmc due to a hot gas halo component .",
    "we also are consistent with the previously observed 0.5 - 2.0 x - ray luminosity for the milky way ( @xmath167 erg s@xmath31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if we assume a gas metallicity of 0.3 @xmath131 .",
    "an independent estimate of the halo gas metallicity using absorption line profile results from @xcite and these current emission line results also suggests a gas metallicity of @xmath10.3 @xmath131 .",
    "this metallicity is also consistent with simulations of galactic coronae @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between our and fit results is likely due to variation in the emission properties of the lb rather than residual swcx emission .",
    "this patchiness in the emission has been analyzed in the rosat r12 band ( 1/4 kev ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would have a stronger effect on the emission lines compared to the emission lines .",
    "we attempt to quantify this patchiness in the emission lines by adding an uncertainty to the observations .",
    "we find we must add an uncertainty of 2.1 l.u . to the emission lines ( @xmath140% the median line strength ) to find an acceptable @xmath220 .",
    "optical depth corrections are likely necessary in our model emission line calculation since evidence suggests the hot halo plasma has optical depths of order unity @xcite .",
    "we attempt to quantify these effects and find optical depth corrections to the emission line calculations increase ( steepen ) our fitted @xmath2 by about 10% .",
    "future work will involve rectifying the final two topics discussed above .",
    "we aim to reproduce the sightline - to - sightline variability in the observations with a physical model plasma model including our smooth hot gas halo profile with a presumably more clumpy or variable lb model . this will involve detailed observational and theoretical work on the local ism / cgm .",
    "we also intend to utilize more detailed radiative transfer codes to quantify the optical depth effects present in the plasma .",
    "our simple parameterization of the optical depth corrections indicates these effects may be minor , but they will provide even tighter constraints on the milky way s hot gas density profile .",
    "this will lead to improved estimates on quantities such as the mass and metallicity of the halo gas .",
    "even with the above limitations , we emphasize the significant improvement these results are compared to previous work on the milky way s hot gas halo . not only have we dramatically reduced the density and resultant mass uncertainties for the milky way s hot gas halo , but have done so while utilizing emission lines rather than absorption lines",
    "this supports the power of these new large samples of emission lines ( several hundred sightlines ) compared with the much smaller absorption line samples ( @xmath130 sightlines ) .",
