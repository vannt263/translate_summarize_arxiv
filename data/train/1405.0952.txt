    "one upshot of harvey and lawson s work on singular connections @xcite is a refinement of some classical results in differential topology and geometry .",
    "in essence , each of these classical theorems gives two different representatives for the same cohomology class , using different constructions for the cohomology theory of a manifold .",
    "for example , the celebrated chern - gauss - bonnet in its general form asserts that on an oriented vector bundle with connection , the euler form of the underlying connection determines a derham cohomology class which is poincar dual to the zero locus of a generic section of the bundle .",
    "the refinement consists in giving a transgression formula that `` quantifies '' at the level of currents how these two representatives differ .",
    "harvey and lawson give a recipe on how to get `` canonically '' a current whose differential is the difference of the two representatives .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the transgression formulas themselves are of a cohomological nature .",
    "in fact , using the `` dichotomy '' between smooth and integral currents , harvey , lawson and zweck construct a new variant of _ smooth _ cohomology theory @xcite such that the groups of the so called de rham - federer differential characters are isomorphic with the groups of differential characters of cheeger and simons @xcite .",
    "the transgression equations naturally produce objects in these groups .    in the past 20 years",
    ", the authors of @xcite and their collaborators have discovered new and important links of their theory of transgression formulas with other areas and in particular with morse theory @xcite . while @xcite was the starting point of the theory ,",
    "the framework and results that motivated the writing of the present note are part of @xcite with major technical inputs from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we should add that there is basically no mention of singular connections in this article .",
    "our initial project was to generalize some parts of @xcite to an infinite dimensional context and we obtained indeed some preliminary results in that direction @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that even in finite dimensions one can give an expansion of the existing theory , embracing new examples and clarifying certain technical aspects .",
    "this is what we tried to accomplish in the present note .",
    "roughly half of the article is made up of examples .",
    "another substantial part of it consists of new proofs of known results using the theorems herein .",
    "our main result is a very general homotopy formula .",
    "[ t11 ] let @xmath0 be a fiber bundle of oriented manifolds .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is a riemannian metric on @xmath2 with respect to which all fibers are complete , @xmath3 is a smooth form , @xmath4 is a smooth , proper , fiberwise morse - bott - smale function satisfying a certain local - constancy condition and @xmath5 is a section transversal to the stable bundles of @xmath6 , the vertical gradient of @xmath7 , assumed to be complete .",
    "suppose furthermore that @xmath8 form a strongly atomic tuple ( def .",
    "[ sattup ] ) and that @xmath9 satisfies a certain integrability condition ( see ( [ eq2snv ] ) ) . then the following equality of locally flat currents holds : @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the flow of @xmath12 up to time @xmath13 via @xmath6 , @xmath14 are the stable / unstable bundles of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a certain residue form along @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , there exist currents on @xmath18 with @xmath19-coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that : @xmath22+\\mathscr{t}_{\\infty}(d\\omega).\\ ] ]    let us take a more detailed look at the context .",
    "the precursor to theorem [ t11 ] is theorem 10.3 in @xcite .",
    "this is the particular case where one takes @xmath2 to be the fiber bundle with fiber the grassmannian of linear subspaces of a certain @xmath23-graded vector bundle @xmath24 .",
    "the flow considered in that article is the compactification of the linear flow on @xmath25 which takes @xmath26 .",
    "the proof , which seems to contain a glitch ( see remark [ glrem ] ) takes advantage of the fact that the fiber is a grassmannian and does not generalize . instead",
    ", the main techniques to prove theorem [ t11 ] are contained in @xcite where latschev shows , among other things that the stable and unstable manifolds of a morse - bott - smale flow in a _ compact _",
    "manifold have finite volume .",
    "the idea is to construct a compact manifold with corners which comes with a surjective projection to the closure of the stable / unstable manifold , projection which is a diffeomorphism on a dense open subset : in other words , a bott - samelson resolution with corners .",
    "notice that the finite volume of the unstable manifolds is necessary in relation ( [ t12 ] ) in order for the right hand side to make sense if no integrability condition is imposed on @xmath9 . in order to prove theorem [ t11 ] and its cousins we rewrote the proof of the main technical lemma from latschev s article @xcite in order to fit our necessities . by the way ,",
    "latschev s homotopy formula ( theorem 4.1 in @xcite ) becomes a particular case of the above result for a certain tautological section ( see corollary [ corlat ] ) .",
    "the interest in formulas like ( [ t12 ] ) and ( [ t13 ] ) comes from the application of theorem [ t11 ] to closed forms @xmath9 that arise from standard constructions .",
    "one example is the classical chern - weil theory with @xmath9 a characteristic form associated to a connection in a vector bundle @xmath27 .",
    "initially this is a form on the base space . in order to get the machinery running ,",
    "one needs another piece of data and that is a section of @xmath28 .",
    "one can in fact think of it as a section of @xmath29 .",
    "now one pulls back the bundle with connection @xmath30 over @xmath2 .",
    "the theory applies to the characteristic form of the chern connection of the hyperplane tautological bundle @xmath31 , connection obtained by orthogonally projecting @xmath32 onto @xmath33 .",
    "the example of the transgression formula for the top chern form of a connection on a complex vector bundle is worked out in complete detail in section [ tcc ] .",
    "while this is in fact a perfect example of the theory developed in @xcite , the details are spread out over two articles : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we gather all the pieces here because this is a beautiful illustration of how one can go quite far armed with formula ( [ t12 ] ) and a minimal number of computations . in fact , in this case , one has to perform just one universal computation .",
    "the computation seems standard but we include it here for completeness .",
    "the set - up of a fiber bundle with a grassmannian fiber together with the compactification of the linear flow mentioned a bit earlier seems to be sufficient for such applications . however , there are other situations in which one would like to be able to flow forms at `` infinity '' and concretely describe the resulting current . in principle , the number of applications is only limited by the ability of finding locally constant morse - bott - smale flows ( for the exact requirements see section [ section 3 ] ) and interesting forms @xmath9 .",
    "we apply theorem [ t11 ] in sections [ occms ] and [ sccf ] to produce transgression formulas in ( cohomological ) odd degree .",
    "we recover a result of nicolaescu @xcite and answer a question of quillen from @xcite with this occasion .    in his celebrated article @xcite ,",
    "quillen left open the question of weak convergence of the chern character forms built out of superconnections on a vector bundle .",
    "these quillen superconnections are made up from a connection @xmath34 and a self - adjoint endomorphism @xmath35 on a bundle .",
    "in @xcite he proved that the chern character forms for @xmath36 , in the limit @xmath37 , concentrate on the singular set of @xmath35 , i.e. the points where @xmath35 has kernel .",
    "quillen asked about the exact conditions of when this limit exists . while it was clear from the very first treatise on the subject ( @xcite ) that the characteristic forms harvey and lawson built using a section , a connection and a mode of approximation bears a resemblance to the superconnection formalism , to our knowledge there",
    "has not appeared in the literature an exposition making this resemblance more apparent .",
    "we take up this task here in section [ sccf ] , not through the theory of singular connections but with the means at our disposal .",
    "we take advantage of another important result of quillen @xcite , that allows the extension of the superconnection chern character forms to accommodate situations when the bundle endomorphism is unitary and not self - adjoint as in the original construction .",
    "this is done using the cayley and laplace transforms in @xcite and applies equally well to even and odd @xmath38-theory .",
    "this `` trick '' gives forms defined not only on a dense , open set but on the full grassmannian , forms which can be flown out .",
    "one of the highlights of our applications is the computation of this limit at infinity , described explicitly in theorems [ ansqu ] and [ ansqu2 ] .",
    "the main result of nicolaescu in @xcite is about the poincar duality of certain invariant forms on the unitary group @xmath39 ( arising from the maurer - cartan connection ) and certain currents appearing as stable manifolds of natural `` height '' morse functions on @xmath39 .",
    "the original proof made appeal to the theory of analytic currents of hardt @xcite .",
    "we should say that analyticity ) .",
    "] has its own important role in the theory as clearly demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite straightforward to see that nicolaescu s theorem is a particular case of theorem [ t11 ] .",
    "the hardest part seems to be the computation of a certain residue , a result which we believe is interesting in itself .",
    "this is done in appendix [ resu ] .    in section",
    "[ occms ] , we introduce a representative for a degree zero de rham - federer differential character called the maslov spark . this object is naturally associated to a pair made of a unitary bundle isomorphism and a connection .",
    "the maslov cycle , the locally integrally flat part of the maslov spark , and its higher degree relatives , discussed at length in @xcite , have a well known relation with the spectral flow of a family of self - adjoint fredholm operators .    in the last section",
    "we show the usefulness of theorem [ t11 ] in its non - compact formulation .",
    "the fiber bundle @xmath40 is simply a vector bundle .",
    "we recover a formula of getzler from @xcite , equivalent with chern - gauss - bonnet , formula where he uses thom forms which are gaussian shaped , in the spirit of the mathai - quillen formalism .",
    "in fact , getzler s result and a theorem by bismut in @xcite and in general the superconnection formalism were the other important motivation for the present results .",
    "one important notion harvey and lawson introduced in @xcite is that of geometric atomicity .",
    "one says that a section @xmath12 is ( weakly ) geometrically atomic with respect to a vertical vector field @xmath41 on the fiber bundle @xmath40 if the volume of @xmath42 is finite .",
    "it turns out that a transgression formula [ t13 ] makes sense in this conditions even if @xmath41 is not the vertical gradient of a nice morse - bott - smale function ( see theorem [ t1 ] ) .",
    "however , in this general context not much can be said about @xmath43 .",
    "geometric atomicity is philosophically central to the article since the convergence of currents ( locally ) in the mass norm or the flat norm depends essentially on having finite volume at finite distances .",
    "the completeness of the fibers , properness of @xmath7 and the integrability conditions on @xmath9 - a tuple being strongly atomic is essentially one such condition - insure that things behave well at @xmath44 as well . as",
    "a matter of fact , theorem [ t11 ] is a two stage generalization of the aforementioned result from @xcite . in the first stage , we assume compact fiber and no condition on @xmath9 and we prove theorem [ refhomf ] . in the second stage we noticed that not much changes if the finite volume condition is replaced by an integrability condition .",
    "this clarifies also the role of geometric atomicity , weak or strong .    as we said before ,",
    "one big part of the article is made up of proofs of known results and one of these is latschev s main theorem about the existence of bott - samelson resolutions with corners .",
    "we include a complete treatment in the appendix because on one hand we needed the details in the proof of theorem [ refhomf ] and on the other hand because it brings a certain degree of simplification to some of the original arguments .    among other applications",
    ", we give a short proof of a refined version of the chern - gauss - bonnet theorem using the fiberwise one - point compactification of an oriented real vector bundle and the height function in the role of @xmath7 . as opposed to most other known proofs this one does not go through the construction of a thom form on the real vector bundle first .",
    "finally , in section [ occms ] we include a short discussion about a possible approach to an odd chern - weil theory .",
    "_ acknowledgements : _ my first contact with the fundamental work of harvey and lawson was through conversations with liviu nicolaescu .",
    "he also made important suggestions that helped improved the exposition .",
    "for this and for many other obvious reasons , i would like to warmly thank him . in the past several years , several people have listen to me occasionally talking about transgression and sparks and superconnections .",
    "i can not say for sure that i convinced them i was talking about mathematics . among them",
    "are marianty ionel , michael deutsch , jorge de lira , levi lima , lev birbrair , paulo piccione and luciano mari .",
    "i owe them many thanks , for patiently listening to my repeatedly imprecise statements .",
    "all manifolds used in this article are smooth , finite dimensional and _ without boundary _ , although they could potentially be disconnected and non - compact unless stated otherwise .",

    "in the next section we will be imposing certain pleasant properties on @xmath41 in order to obtain refined results . here",
    "we will only assume that the flow determined by @xmath41 is _ complete _ , which is automatic for example if @xmath49 is compact .",

    "notice the different grading on @xmath62 .",
    "we follow @xcite in using a convention that has the advantage of making the operator @xmath63 of degree @xmath64 just like @xmath65 on forms .",

    "we used @xmath70 where it is standard to put @xmath71 .",
    "this is due to the grading convention .",
    "notice that in order for the integral above to make sense one only needs an orientation on @xmath18 . for everything that follows one does not need @xmath2 or the fiber @xmath45 to be orientable , just for @xmath18 to have a fixed orientation .",
    "one can in fact remove even this requirement by working with twisted forms as described in the appendix of @xcite . in our set - up",
    "one would ask for @xmath9 to be an _ untwisted form _ ( for which the operation of pull - back makes sense ) but all @xmath72 would be twisted forms on @xmath18 and therefore @xmath73 would be twisted and could be integrated over @xmath18 .",
    "we do not see any inconvenient in using this convention throughout the article . however , we preferred a more classical set - up .",
    "we investigate the conditions under which the limit @xmath74 exists in the weak sense .",
    "let us start with an elementary result .",

    "most of the time we will use weak geometric atomicity on @xmath107 and therefore we will omit to specify the semi - axis .    for the rest of this section _ weak geometric atomicity _ is the relevant notion .",

    "the projection onto the first factor of @xmath108 takes @xmath112 diffeomorphically onto @xmath113 .",
    "this projection is a riemannian submersion .",
    "it is an easy exercise to show that the volume of the section of a riemannian submersion is bigger or equal the volume of the base space .",
    "therefore @xmath114    the definition of weak / strong geometric atomicity seems to depend on the metric on @xmath2 .",
    "however , if @xmath2 is compact then one can check easily that the condition does not depend on the metric .",
    "it turns out that the following more general fact is true : the condition of geometric atomicity depends only on the equivalence class of vertical riemannian metrics on the vector bundle @xmath115 , equivalence which can be defined as follows .",
    "two metrics @xmath116 and @xmath117 are in the same class if for every @xmath118 there exist a neighborhood @xmath119 and constants @xmath120 and @xmath121 such that @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath124 represent the riemannian metrics on the fiber @xmath125 .",
    "in particular , any two vertical metrics are equivalent if the fiber @xmath49 is compact .",
    "notice that the definition of geometric atomicity is vacuous for periodic flows since only sections @xmath12 for which @xmath126 has hausdorff dimension smaller than @xmath46 could potentially fulfill the condition , a situation that will not be treated here .",

    "a smooth form @xmath3 is called ( locally ) vertically bounded if for every compact @xmath127 there exists a constant @xmath128 such that @xmath129    in particular every smooth form on a fiber bundle with compact fiber is vertically bounded .",

    "moreover @xmath1170 is the conjugate of @xmath1167 which can be seen as a form with values in the dual to @xmath1171 via metric duality .",
    "we prove this by induction .",
    "for @xmath1180 this is clearly true .",
    "notice that @xmath1181 .",
    "it is quite easy to see that the monomials that contain @xmath1182 twice or one @xmath1182 and one @xmath120 vanish .",
    "instead of writing @xmath1183 , we write @xmath1184 .",
    "we have due to the relations above @xmath1185 ( cb+bc + b^2)=\\ ] ] @xmath1186 @xmath1187      we use the cayley transform that preserves the orientation @xmath1193 to turn the integral @xmath1194 into the integral @xmath1195 which we compute with the help of the residue theorem , therefore obtaining @xmath1196    in order to compute @xmath1197 we remark that by its very definition @xmath375 satisfies : @xmath1198 which implies that @xmath1199 is actually an @xmath39 invariant form of maximum degree in @xmath1140 .",
    "therefore it has to be a constant multiple of the volume form on @xmath1140 . to determine this multiple fix a point @xmath1200\\in { { \\mathbb c}}{{{\\mathbb p}}}^{n-1}$ ] and denote by @xmath1201 the canonical @xmath388-forms which form a basis in the dual space to @xmath1202 .",
    "then @xmath1203 now @xmath1204 and hence the top - left entry of of @xmath1205 is @xmath1206 on the other hand for the matrix of two forms @xmath1207 we have the following :      the @xmath1209 entry of @xmath1210 is a huge sum : @xmath1211 where @xmath1212 is an entry of @xmath1213 .",
    "it is then straightforward that @xmath1210 is diagonal and every diagonal entry is up to a sign @xmath1214 .",
    "the sign requires a bit of care .",
    "we therefore get from lemma [ comp6 ] and ( [ comp5 ] ) that @xmath1215 recall now that the standard kahler form on @xmath1140 at the point @xmath1216 ( see @xcite , page 31 ) is : @xmath1217 and @xmath1218 due to the fact that we are dealing with invariant forms we get that the identity @xmath1219 holds everywhere and therefore : @xmath1220 putting together fubini theorem together with ( [ comp2 ] ) , ( [ comp3 ] ) and ( [ comp4 ] ) finishes the proof of the proposition .",
