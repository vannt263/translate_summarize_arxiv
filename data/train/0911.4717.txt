    "the shock waves and high - strain - rate phenomena are involved in many physical phenomena , therefore , we are interested in understanding the physical properties of solids under these non - trivial conditions .",
    "investigation of different anisotropic solids ( e.g. , single crystals and polycrystalline alloys ) under shock loading has found significant interest in the research community @xcite-@xcite .",
    "modern , high - resolution methods to monitoring the stress and particle velocity histories in shock waves and equipment have been created @xcite-@xcite ; numerous investigations into the mechanical properties of different classes of materials have been undertaken @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ; and numerous phenomenological as well as microscopic models have been developed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of a perfectly adequate general understanding , experimental methodology , and theory , material models do not agree in detail , especially for anisotropic solids .",
    "for many years , it has been assumed that the response of materials to shock loading is isotropic , and only recently has anisotropy in the shock response attracted the attention of researchers . in the early 2000s , gray iii _",
    "@xcite , @xcite showed that under shock loading conditions ( one - dimensional strain space ) , the variation of the hugoniot elastic limit ( hel ) or the yield strength of annealed zirconium was consistent with the quasi - static experimental data . to describe the anisotropic solids response under shock loading the following several factors must be addressed during the numerical modelling : ( a ) large compressions lead to a nonlinear behavior  an equation of state ( eos ) is required , ( b ) low yield stresses lead to large plastic deformations ",
    "an appropriate strength model is required . to address these factors , thermodynamically consistent framework for modelling the response of single crystal and polycrystalline alloys under shock loading",
    "was developed .",
    "this framework , building on the thermodynamic approach of wallace @xcite and continuum framework of johnson @xcite-@xcite , couples nonlinear elasticity with non - associated anisotropic plasticity within a thermodynamically consistent numerical incremental formalism @xcite .",
    "the eos for isotropic materials typically defines the pressure as a function of density @xmath0 ( or specific volume , @xmath1 ) and specific internal energy @xmath2 .",
    "experimental shock hugoniots have been widely used as reference state data for extrapolating to other high - pressure and high - temperature thermodynamic states .",
    "the extrapolation has been done by using a very popular form of equation of state that is used extensively for isotropic solid continua is the mie - grneisen eos : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the grneisen gamma , @xmath5 is the initial grneisen gamma , @xmath6 is the first order volume correction to @xmath5 , and @xmath7 is the hydrostatic pressure . assuming @xmath8 to be a function of volume only ( [ luk1_1 ] )",
    ", the mie - grneisen eos provides a simple extrapolation of a known set of hugoniots data to other sets of thermodynamic states : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hugoniot pressure , @xmath11 is the relative change of volume .",
    "the shock compression process is characterized by the rankine - hugoniot jump relations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot equations for the shock jump conditions includes five variables : pressure @xmath7 , particle velocity @xmath12 , shock velocity @xmath13 , density @xmath0 ( or specific volume , @xmath1 ) and energy @xmath2 .",
    "hence , an additional equation is needed . in many dynamic experiments , @xmath12 ( the particle velocity directly behind the shock ) and @xmath13 ( the velocity at which the shock wave propagates through the medium ) are measured .",

    "following steinberg s model @xcite , the shock velocity is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the velocity curve intercept ( can be approximated by the bulk speed of sound ) .",

    "before discussing an anisotropic equation of state , the generalized decomposition of the stress tensor is summarized in @xcite .",
    "the generalized decomposition framework will provide a useful point of construction an anisotropic equation of state .",
    "the definition of pressure in the case of an anisotropic solids should be the result of stating that the `` pressure '' term should only produce a change of scale , i.e. isotropic state of strain .",
    "this should allow the calculation of the direct stress ratios that will produce only a change of scale @xcite .",
    "the generalized decomposition of the stress tensor @xmath27 is defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the generalized spherical part of the stress tensor , @xmath30 is the generalized deviatoric stress tensor , @xmath31 is the total generalized `` pressure '' and @xmath32 is the first generalization of the kronecker s delta symbol . the constructive definition of the tensor @xmath32 is based on the fact that stress tensor @xmath33 is induced in the anisotropic medium by the applied isotropic strain tensor @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath36 is the volumetric strain , @xmath37 is the kronecker s delta symbol ( unit tensor ) , @xmath38 is the elastic stiffness matrix , and @xmath39 is the first generalized bulk modulus .",

    "@xmath43 has been expressed @xcite as : @xmath44 where @xmath7 is the pressure related to the volumetric deformation ( [ luk3_1_1 ] ) and @xmath45 is the second generalization of the kronecker s delta symbol .",
    "the constructive definition of the tensor @xmath45 is based on the fact that stress tensor @xmath46 is independent of the stress tensor @xmath47 , i.e. their contraction product is zero for any deviatoric strain tensor @xmath48 , where @xmath38 is the elastic stiffness matrix .",
    "the following relation describes the functional definition of the second order material tensor @xmath45 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the second generalized bulk modulus .",
    "the solution of equations ( [ luk3_4_1 ] ) in terms of @xmath45 components and expression for @xmath50 are presented below . equations ( [ luk3_4 ] ) define the correct generalized `` pressure '' for the elastic regime .",

    "also , parameters @xmath39 and @xmath50 were considered as the first and the second generalized bulk moduli . in the limit of isotropy",
    "they reduce to the well - know expression for conventional bulk modulus .      during shock loading",
    ", the medium undergoes nonlinear behavior ; therefore an equation of state ( eos ) is required to describe the medium s response under shock loading conditions .",
    "it is convenient for use in numerical codes to have an analytical form of the eos .",
    "such an analytic form is at best an approximation to the true relationship .",
    "thermodynamical definition of the grneisen parameter @xmath61 is the following : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the entropy , @xmath64 is the temperature , @xmath65 is the heat capacity at constant specific volume .",
    "this definition may be generalized to a tensor @xmath66 for the stress - strain variables @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the strain tensor and @xmath69 is the heat capacity at constant strains . using maxwell s thermodynamic relations , the isotropic mie - grneisen eos can be generalized for anisotropic media as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an anisotropic stress tensor produced by the isotropic strain state .",
    "also , this eos ( [ luk4_3 ] ) is consistent with the wallace s model @xcite , where a full anisotropic stress was used .",
    "it has been shown ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) that the stress tensor @xmath33 is produced by the spherical isotropic strain tensor @xmath72 , hence ( [ luk4_3 ] ) can be re - written as : @xmath73 where the pressure @xmath7 is defined by the constitutive equations ( [ luk3_4 ] ) and @xmath74 is the isotropic strain .      the equations ( [ luk3_4 ] ) define the correct generalized `` pressure '' for the elastic regime .",
    "to provide an appropriate description for general anisotropic materials behavior at high pressures , the pressure @xmath7 related to the volumetric deformations is described by @xmath75 ( [ luk1_4 ] ) , ( [ luk4_4 ] ) .",

    "furthermore , the good agreement of the general pulse shape and hugoniot stress level suggests that the eos is performing satisfactorily .",
    "the significance of the proposed strength model includes also the distortion of the yield function shape in tension , compression and in different principal directions of anisotropy ( e.g. , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) which can be used to describe the anisotropic strength differential effect ( anisotropic sde ) .",
