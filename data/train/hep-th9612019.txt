    "despite many efforts during the last decades a consistent theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) is still lacking .",
    "the standard einstein gravity is known to be non - renormalizable .",
    "but also renormalizable models like @xmath2-gravity ( see @xcite for a review ) have other serious problems instead of this ( e.  g. presumably non - unitarity of the s - matrix ) .    in such circumstances",
    "it is quite reasonable to consider some of the known pre - qg theories as effective models which appear from fundamental theories and which are valid below a definite scale only ( e.  g. planck mass ) .",
    "in such a spirit one can introduce models to describe qg in the far infrared ( at large distances ) @xcite , new models of four - dimensional qg like dilatonic qg @xcite and so on .",
    "for example , taking account of ir effects in qg with cosmological constant an effective model for the conformal factor @xcite has been constructed .",
    "due to strong renormalization effects in the infrared this model may provide the solution of the cosmological constant problem . on the other hand , the type of theories to describe the effective ir dynamics in qg maybe extended to quantum @xmath2-gravity @xcite and to quantum supergravity @xcite . due to the fact that the effective conformal factor model @xcite maybe formulated as renormalizable theory one can calculate the ( perturbative ) running of the newtonian coupling constant in such a theory @xcite .",
    "note that the running of cosmological and newtonian coupling constants also can be discussed in other renormalizable theories ( guts in curved spacetime , @xmath2-gravity @xcite ) where results of one - loop calculations of the corresponding @xmath3-functions are available . of course",
    ", all such considerations are closely related with the perturbative approach to the effective action in qg .    however ,",
    "if one still insists in using the non - renormalizable einstein theory as low - energy effective theory for qg other methods should be employed . in particular , the use of non - perturbative rg in wilson s effective action approach @xcite maybe quite useful .",
    "in such an approach the non - renormalizability of the theory is no problem since the rg equation governing the evolution of the effective action from a scale @xmath4 , where the theory is well defined , to a smaller scales @xmath5 can be constructed . such a finite rg equation ( or evolution equation )",
    "maybe consistently formulated in the frame of the effective average action @xcite ( for recent discussions on related non - perturbative rg approaches see @xcite and references therein ) .    in a recent work @xcite the scale - dependent gravitational average effective action",
    "@xmath6 $ ] has been discussed in the background field formalism .",
    "the corresponding exact and truncated evolution equations have been derived , and a special solution of the truncated equation has been given .",
    "the scale dependence of the cosmological and newtonian constants in einstein gravity has been determined ( for earlier discussions of the average effective potential in qg see @xcite ) .",
    "the whole study has been done using the background harmonic gauge ( fock - de  donder  gauge ) .",
    "it has been found that the newtonian coupling constant increases at large distances .    on the same time",
    "it is quite well - known that the standard effective action in the background field method depends on the choice of the gauge fixing condition ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this gauge dependence is controlled by the corresponding background ward identities ( slavnov - taylor identities ) .",
    "moreover it is usually assumed in quantum field theory that the effective action ( if non - perturbatively calculated ) does not depend on the gauge condition at its stationary point .",
    "of course , in practice where only one - loop results are easily available it often happens that the effective action even at stationary points depends on the gauge fixing .",
    "this could lead to an apparent ( or intermediate ) gauge dependence also of some physical quantities .",
    "similarly , in the study of effective average action with the background field method its gauge dependence is obvious .",
    "such a gauge dependence is controlled by the background ward identities again @xcite .",
    "however it means that results obtained by investigation of the evolution equation ( especially in the truncated form ) necessarily should depend on the gauge choice .",
    "hence it is interesting to investigate this gauge dependence for a scale - dependent gravitational action @xmath6 $ ] and for the associated evolution equation .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss this question of gauge dependence for einstein gravity with cosmological constant in a class of gauges depending on some parameter @xmath1 where @xmath7 corresponds to the harmonic gauge .",
    "the paper is written as follows . in the next section , following @xcite , we briefly review the scale - dependent gravitational action and derive the exact and truncated rg equations .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the calculation of the one - loop partition function for einstein qg on de  sitter background ( we work in the @xmath1-parametric class of gauges ) .",
    "this one - loop partition function actually defines the truncated evolution equation . in section  4 the evolution equations for the cosmological and gravitational constants",
    "are explicitly obtained with account of the gauge dependence .",
    "the running of the newtonian coupling constant is analysed in section  5 .",
    "it is shown that for some region of the gauge parameter einstein gravity shows antiscreening ( @xmath8 ) while for other values of @xmath1 it shows a screening effect .",
    "the resolution of this unphysical gauge - depending situation is presented in the final section .",
    "we start with a short review of the average effective action formalism in qg ; mainly we follow the exposition given in @xcite .",
    "first we introduce a scale - dependent modification of the generating functional for connected green s functions of qg in four dimensions here we decomposed the integration variable @xmath9 being the gravitational field into a fixed background metric @xmath10 and into @xmath11 , the small fluctuations around this background , @xmath12 this background field method ( for an introduction , see @xcite ) permits to replace the integration over @xmath13 by an integration over @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the ghost and anti - ghost fields for the gravitational field , respectively .",
    "the first term of the action , @xmath17 $ ] , denotes the classical part being invariant under general coordinate transformations @xmath18 generated by the lie derivative with respect to an arbitrary vector field . at the moment",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is positive definite , since the functional integral makes sense only if it converges .",
    "however , as has been argued in @xcite this assumption is not necessary for the validity of the evolution equation which we want to derive ( also the use of lorentzian metric changes this equation only in an obvious manner ) .    the gauge fixing term @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 = \\frac{1}{2 \\alpha } { \\int\\!\\ !",

    "the derivatives @xmath25 are covariant with respect to the background metric @xmath10 .",
    "by @xmath26 we denote the ghost action which can be written for this choice of gauge fixing with the help of the faddeev - popov operator @xmath27^\\mu_{\\;\\;\\nu } = { \\bar{g}_{}}^{\\mu\\rho } { \\bar{g}_{}}^{\\sigma\\lambda }     \\bar d_\\lambda ( \\gamma_{\\rho\\nu } d_\\sigma + \\gamma_{\\sigma\\nu } d_\\rho ) -     { \\bar{g}_{}}^{\\rho\\sigma } { \\bar{g}_{}}^{\\mu\\lambda } \\bar d_\\lambda\\ , \\gamma_{\\sigma\\nu }     d_\\rho\\ ] ] as @xmath28 = -\\sqrt{2 } { \\int\\!\\ ! d^{\\;\\!4 } x\\ , \\sqrt{\\bar g}\\:}\\bar c_\\mu { \\cal m }           [ { \\bar{g}_{}}+h , { \\bar{g}_{}}]^\\mu_{\\;\\;\\nu } c^\\nu    \\quad.\\ ] ] that part of the action introduced so far , namely @xmath29 , is invariant under brst transformations which will not be specified here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition we introduced an ir cutoff for the gravitational field and for the ghosts : @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] are the cutoff operators being defined below .",
    "they discriminate between low- and high - momentum modes .",
    "whereas eigenmodes of @xmath32 with eigenvalues @xmath33 are integrated out in ( [ e2.1 ] ) without suppression , modes with eigenvalues @xmath34 are damped by a kind of momentum dependent mass term .",
    "this ensures the renormalizibility of the theory , which is an effective one at scale @xmath35 .",
    "both cutoff operators have the structure @xmath36 = { \\cal z}_k k^2 r^{(0)}(-\\bar d^2/ k^2 ) \\quad.\\ ] ] the dimensionless function @xmath37 will be chosen as ( see @xcite ) @xmath38 it interpolates smoothly between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the factors @xmath41 are different for the graviton and for the ghosts .",
    "for the ghosts @xmath42 is a pure number but for the graviton @xmath43 is a tensor constructed from the background metric . in the simplest case it is @xmath44 .",
    "the last term in ( [ e2.1 ] ) is the source term where @xmath45 denotes the lie derivative with respect to the ghost field . obviously , the sources @xmath46 and @xmath47 couple to the brst variations of @xmath11 and @xmath15",
    "now , to obtain the effective average action @xmath0 , we perform a legendre transformation of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , let us first introduce the @xmath49 _",
    "-dependent _ classical fields ( also called mean fields ) @xmath50 then the effective average action is obtained as the first two terms correspond to the usual legendre transform . by definition",
    "the effective average action is the difference between the usual legendre transform and the cutoff action @xmath51 with the classical fields inserted . for @xmath52",
    "the cutoff @xmath51 disappears and we get back the usual legendre transform .",
    "in analogy to @xmath53 we introduced the metric @xmath54 and we considered @xmath0 as functional of @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 . the effective average action @xmath0 depends on the mean fields as well as parametrically on the sources @xmath3 and @xmath57 and on the background metric @xmath58 .",
    "it should be noted that this functional by virtue of the background field technique is invariant under general coordinate transformations . in this",
    "effective average action excitations with momenta larger than @xmath35 are integrated out , while those with momenta smaller than @xmath35 are suppressed by @xmath51 such that @xmath0 describes an effective theory at scale @xmath35 . in this sense",
    "the flow of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath35 interpolates between an action containing the classical action @xmath59 and the common effective action @xmath60 .",
    "the trajectory in the space of all action functionals can be obtained as the solution of renormalization group equations .",
    "@xmath19 enters via the initial condition for the trajectory at some uv cutoff scale @xmath4 : @xmath61 .",
    "while for renormalizable theories @xmath4 may be send to infinity at the end , for qg it is a fixed , finite scale .",
    "having now introduced the effective average action we derive the evolution equation for @xmath0 according to the procedure introduced in @xcite .",
    "we take the derivative of the eq .",
    "( [ e2.1 ] ) with respect to the renormalization group `` time '' @xmath62 and , after legendre transformation , express the rhs in terms of @xmath0 using the relation between connected and 1pi two - point functions .",
    "thus we obtain the following _ exact _ evolution equation where @xmath63 denotes the second functional derivative of @xmath0 , e.g. @xmath64 @xmath65 is a matrix in the field space whose non - zero entries are the traces in ( [ e2.15 ] ) have to be interpreted as @xmath66 ; they are convergent , in the uv- and in the ir - region , for all cutoffs which are similar to ( [ e2.7 ] ) .",
    "the main contributions come from the region of momenta around @xmath35 , because of the appearance of the factor @xmath67 ; large momenta are exponentially suppressed .",
    "now the problem is to solve eq .",
    "( [ e2.15 ] ) .",
    "one way to find at least approximate but still nonperturbative solutions is to truncate the space of action functionals .",
    "this means that we work on a finite - dimensional subspace parametrised by only a few couplings .",
    "let us in a first step try to neglect the evolution of ghosts .",
    "this leads us to the following ansatz the classical ghost and gauge fixing terms have the same functional form as for the bare action .",
    "also the couplings to the brst variations do not change .",
    "the other terms depend on @xmath55 and @xmath58 .",
    "the first term @xmath68 \\equiv \\gamma_k[g , g , 0 , 0 ; 0 , 0]\\ ] ] is the most interesting one , while @xmath69 contains only the deviations for @xmath70 such that @xmath71=0 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the interpretation of @xmath69 as describing the quantum corrections to the gauge fixing term @xmath20 which also vanishes for @xmath72 .",
    "it is easy to show that for an uv cutoff scale @xmath73 the action @xmath74 fulfils the initial condition @xmath75 = s[g]$ ] with @xmath19 being the classical action . if we solve eq .",
    "( [ e2.15 ] ) directly and analyse the initial condition for @xmath0 we find that @xmath76 must be satisfied .",
    "this suggests to set @xmath77 for all @xmath35 in a second step . from the slavnov - taylor identity of @xmath0 it follows ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) that @xmath69 contains higher loop effects such that this kind of approximation really makes sense .",
    "inserting ansatz ( [ e2.17 ] ) into the evolution equation ( [ e2.15 ] ) we obtain the _ truncated _ evolution equation which we wanted to derive here we introduced @xmath78 = \\bar\\gamma_k[g ] + s_{\\mathrm}{gf}[g-{\\bar{g } _ { } } ; { \\bar{g } _ { } } ]             \\simeq \\gamma_k[g , { \\bar{g } _ { } } , 0 , 0 ; 0 , 0]\\ ] ] while @xmath63 is the hessian of @xmath79 $ ] with respect to @xmath80 at a fixed background metric @xmath10 . as a result of our ansatz the lhs of ( [ e2.19 ] ) does not contain any contributions from the ghosts .",

    "this supports the naive picture that the mass of a particle receives additional positive contributions from the virtual particles surrounding it .",
    "in addition there is a second interval for @xmath1 where the antiscreening changes to a screening effect .",
    "the coefficient @xmath167 does not play any role in the change from antiscreening to screening .",
    "the significant influence of the running of @xmath147 comes from the sign of the numerator of the exponent in ( [ e5.6 ] ) which is @xmath168 .",
    "the value @xmath169 is significant for the used truncation and zeroth order in @xmath155 .",
    "this screening behaviour is an artifact of the truncation where we used @xmath170 .",

    "is shown as function of the gauge parameter @xmath1 and the cutoff scale @xmath35 . the landau - de witt gauge @xmath176 is drawn as a separate curve on the surface . both regions  antiscreening and screening region",
    " are to perceive .",
    "in order to solve the gauge dependence problem we suggest two ways . the first way is the use of a better truncation which includes the gauge parameter as a function of @xmath35 . as argued in the previous section @xmath171 should be a stable fixed point of the theory",
    ". it would be also interesting to use more general gauge fixing conditions .",
    "alternatively it is possible to work with a generalisation of the standard effective action , the so - called gauge - fixing independent effective action ( for an introduction and its different forms , see @xcite ) .",
    "the gauge - fixing independent effective action leads to the same @xmath19-matrix as the standard one ; but by construction it does not depend on the choice of the gauge condition ( off - shell it differs from the standard effective action ) .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that in einstein gravity on de sitter background the one - loop standard effective action in the landau - de witt gauge @xmath171 coincides with the one - loop gauge - fixing independent effective action @xcite .",
    "working with the truncated evolution equation which is very similar to the one - loop approach one may give arguments that the truncated scale - dependent gravitational effective action at @xmath171 coincides with the gauge - fixing independent one .",
    "then the physical value of @xmath168 would be given by ( [ e5.7 ] ) at @xmath171 again .",
    "as one sees the einstein gravity looks as an antiscreening theory where the gravitational constant increases at large distances : @xmath177}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 , ( @xmath179 ) , and the correspondence with the newtonian potential may be restored .    of course , the behaviour of the gravitational coupling constant depends very much on the type of the model one considers .",
    "for example it has a qualitatively different form for the effective theory of the conformal factor @xcite , for @xmath2-gravity @xcite or for the four - dimensional dilaton gravity @xcite . in the very recent calculation of @xmath168 in @xcite ( see also references therein ) it was also found that @xmath168 is positive .",
    "similarly , in @xmath7 gauge @xcite @xmath168 is found to be positive again .",
    "hence , our study of gauge dependence of truncated evolution equation in einstein gravity indicates that the gravitational coupling constant increases at large distances .",
    "there are different possibilities to extend the results of the present work .",
    "the next problem is the calculation using an improved truncation .",
    "one can also consider a more complicated theory like gauged supergravity on gravitational background , to formulate there evolution equation for scale - dependent effective action , and to study the running of gravitational and cosmological constants .",
    "we again will find the problem of the gauge dependence of the evolution equation .",
    "it could be also of interest to discuss in details the cosmological applications of gravitational and cosmological constants running ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , one has to note that taking into account of combined gravity - matter effects ( unified in supermultiplet as in supergravities theories or just einstein - matter type systems ) may also change the behaviour of gravitational and cosmological couplings .",
