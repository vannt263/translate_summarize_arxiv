    "we suggest that the difference in the 4u  1543@xmath0624 results provides support for the local nature of the absorption . since the high - resolution results of 2s  0918@xmath0549 are consistent not only in the measured ne / o number ratio but also in the spectral model in general , we are confident that instrumental differences do not have a significant effect on the spectral results .",
    "it is interesting to note the the ne / o ratios found in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ observations of 2s  0918@xmath0549 are smaller than the inferred value from the _ asca _ result of @xcite , while at the same time the flux of 2s  0918@xmath0549 has decreased by a factor of 10 since the _ asca _ observation .",
    "it is possible that the state changes alter the ionization structure of the local material , which in turn changes the absorbing columns of neutral ne and o. it will be difficult to separate the effect of unusual abundances from ionization changes without more data on these sources .",
    "we propose that multiple observations of 4u  1543@xmath0624 using simultaneous high - resolution and broadband observations will probe the connection between spectral state differences and the column density variations .",
    "it is important to note that ionization effects and the ism contribution must be understood before it is possible to determine the intrinsic ne / o abundance ratio of the local material , which can then be used to place constraints on the composition of the companion .",
    "although we attribute the excess ne absorption in 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 to local material in both of the binaries , we also consider the possibility that the excess ne is due to enhancements of the ism along the line of sight .",
    "the best measurement of absorption toward an x - ray binary , the _ chandra _ spectral analysis of cyg x-1 , shows columns of o and ne that are consistent with standard ism abundances ( schulz et al .",
    "2002 ) . to quantify the variations of the ism abundances ,",
    "we have undertaken a study of the ism using column density measurements from the spectra of x - ray binaries ( juett et al .",
    "initial results show that other lmxbs do not show the ne / o ratios measured for these sources . at most , ne /",
    "o number ratios are only twice the expected ism values .",
    "this is still significantly smaller than we find in 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 , but does suggest that there are some variations between lines - of - sight .",
    "we still favor the interpretation that there is absorbing material local to the binaries , and that this is strengthened by the observation - to - observation variations in the ne / o number ratio of 4u  1543@xmath0624 which could not be due to the ism .",
    "analysis of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ spectra of 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 found no ne or o lines like those seen in 4u  1626@xmath067 .",
    "the absence of strong lines in the spectra of 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 demonstrates that their circumbinary environments are different compared to 4u  1626@xmath067 .",
    "one possible reason for this difference may be that 4u  1626@xmath067 is a pulsar with @xmath70@xmath13@xmath71  g ( orlandini et al . 1998 ) , while 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 are likely to have weak magnetic fields ( @xmath7210@xmath73 g ) .",
    "this undoubtedly results in a substantial difference in the accretion flow geometry .",
    "there is weak evidence for a line - like feature at 6.4  kev in the _ xmm _ spectrum of 4u  1543@xmath0624 .",
    "this feature is very broad and could possibly be due to a mis - modeling of the continuum emission rather than a fe line .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for structure around the ne edge in the spectra of both sources .",
    "it is likely that this is due to instrumental effects but could also be due to structure in either neutral ne edges or possibly due to confusion with ionized o edges .",
    "recent _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ observations of 2s  0918@xmath0549 found the first thermonuclear x - ray bursts from this source @xcite .",
    "both bursts were short , with durations @xmath3@xmath74",
    "s. these short bursts suggest that h and/or he is undergoing unstable burning on the surface of the ns . if the companion has a large c abundance , we might expect to see a much longer burst ( @xmath591 hr ) , like the `` superbursts '' seen in some lmxbs , which have been attributed to thermonuclear burning of c on neutron star surfaces ( cornelisse et al . 2000 ; cumming & bildsten 2001 ; strohmayer & brown 2001 ) .",
    "the more ordinary properties of the x - ray bursts from 2s  0918@xmath0549 may indicate that the donor is not a c - o dwarf as suggested for 4u  1626@xmath067 . in this case , another mechanism for ne enhancement is needed . on the other hand",
    ", it may still be possible for a carbon accretor to show short x - ray bursts .",
    "one possibility is that while the companion is h - deficient , there is still a non - negligible h fraction that is accreted by the ns and is then responsible for the type",
    "i x - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the heavy elements ( c , o , and ne ) may undergo spallation during accretion , leaving he and h nuclei which could then undergo unstable thermonuclear burning in the usual way ( bildsten , salpeter , & wasserman 1992 ) .",
    "spallation reactions would produce @xmath75-ray emission lines at 4.4 and 6.1 mev . unfortunately , the strength of these lines as calculated by bildsten et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is below current observational detection limits . for a 1  ms observation with _",
