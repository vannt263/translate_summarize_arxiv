    "star forming molecular clouds are observed to be highly inhomogeneous in molecular line emission and continuum absorption studies .",
    "they contain relatively empty voids as well as dense `` clumps '' and denser `` cores '' within these clumps .",
    "one expects that stars will form in the densest parts of molecular clouds , and clumps are indeed correlated with young stars @xcite . clumps ( or cores ) therefore appear to be the immediate precursors of clusters , small groups , or individual stars in the interstellar medium ; they constitute the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "theoretical models of diffuse precursors to stars were , until recently , confined to static or quasi - static equilibrium models . mouschovias ( 1976 ) constructed numerical models of static , axisymmetric , magnetically supported , self - gravitating equilibria ( see also : @xcite ) . these models do not include the effects of turbulence .",
    "quasi - static models , in which the effects of turbulence are included as an effective pressure , fixed by an assumed equation of state , have been constructed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "both the static and quasi - static approach have weaknesses .",
    "the static , magnetically supported models predict oblate cores , flattened perpendicular to the mean magnetic field ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "observations yield shapes apparently more consistent with prolate clumps @xcite , and little correlation between field direction and clump shape ( @xcite ) .",
    "they also do not include the effects of turbulent velocities , which are directly observed through their contribution to the linewidth of molecular line transitions even at small spatial scales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quasi - static models , on the other hand , account for turbulent velocities by invoking a steady turbulent pressure . it",
    "not immediately apparent that supersonic turbulence like that observed in molecular clouds would act to prevent collapse , since the turbulence itself leads directly to compressions that might accelerate collapse .",
    "recent numerical simulations show , furthermore , that supersonic magnetized turbulence dissipates in a dynamical time ( @xcite ) . if these simulations correctly represent conditions in molecular clouds then even an approximate steady state can not be achieved unless momentum is continually injected into the cloud .    three - dimensional ( 3d ) , dynamic numerical models of molecular clouds",
    "have recently become practical ( e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ; @xcite ) .",
    "they do not impose a high degree of symmetry on the cloud and allow a largely self - consistent treatment of turbulence , although due to numerical diffusion they have a much lower effective reynolds numbers than real interstellar clouds . in this paper we will study the density concentrations that arise self - consistently from self - gravitating turbulence in a set of numerical models .",
    "before we proceed , it is worth discussing the limitations of the model and the approximations that we use .",
    "our models integrate the equations of isothermal , compressible , self - gravitating , ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "the isothermal approximation is used because realistic , time - dependent heating and cooling that treats the transfer of line radiation out of the cloud is , at present , out of numerical reach ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the model is fully self - gravitating , however , we use periodic boundary conditions in our solution of the poisson equation .",
    "this distorts the gravitational field from what it would be in an isolated cloud by introducing additional tidal forces ( although real clouds are not isolated , tidal forces are smaller ) .",
    "the numerical model is `` ideal '' in the sense that we do not include any explicit physical diffusion coefficients .",
    "all dissipation occurs in shocks , where it is captured by an artificial viscosity , or via numerical diffusion at the grid scale .",
    "thus we do not model physical diffusion processes such as ion - neutral drift .",
    "this is almost certainly important in the dense regions of clouds , but an accurate treatment of the ionization , particularly uv ionization , that would motivate dynamical studies of non - ideal clouds is also numerically out of reach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we give our definition of a `` clump . '' in  3 we describe our numerical methods and tests and give a qualitative and quantitative description of the evolution of the runs .",
    "the clump mass spectrum is described in  4 .",
    "the distribution of clump shapes in described in  5 , the orientation of the clumps with respect to the local and global magnetic field is described in  6 , and a discussion on the clump spin angular momentum is given in  7 .",
    "a summary and comparison with earlier work is given in  8 .",
    "our first task is to define a `` clump . ''",
    "any definition is somewhat arbitrary , much as the designation `` mountain '' is arbitrary in topography",
    ". the definition should be : ( 1 ) physically motivated ; ( 2 ) related to definitions used by observers in molecular line studies of clouds ; ( 3 ) simple to describe ; ( 4 ) easy to apply .",
    "ultimately we are motivated by the desire to characterize those dense regions in molecular clouds that turn into stars .",
    "myers ( 1999 ) adopted the following definitions : a region of size @xmath2 pc over which mean hydrogen number density @xmath3 is called a `` complex '' , a region of size @xmath4 pc over which @xmath5 is termed a `` clump '' and a `` core '' refers to a region of size @xmath6 pc over which @xmath7 .",
    "a complex is well sampled by the co @xmath8 transition , a clump can be traced by the @xmath8 line of @xmath9co while a core is traced by the @xmath10 line of @xmath11 .",
    "the choice of @xmath12 as the fiducial density has several advantages , e.g. , some easily observable molecular lines have effective critical density of this order .",
    "there are two frequently - applied algorithms for identifying clumps in molecular line data .",
    "each begins with intensity data in two space plus one velocity coordinates ( @xmath13 space ) .",
    "the first algorithm , gaussclumps , uses a fitting procedure that removes objects with a constrained gaussian shape from the data ( e.g. @xcite ) ; it is analogous to the clean algorithm used in radio interferometry .",
    "the second algorithm , clumpfind , identifies intensity maxima in @xmath13 space ( @xcite ) , then assigns each `` pixel '' ( i.e. , each channel in a spectrum ) to be a member of the clump associated with the nearest intensity maximum .",
    "these algorithms all implicitly make the assumption that the velocity coordinate @xmath14 is somehow related to the line of sight distance @xmath15 , i.e. that widely separated material that happens to lie at the same velocity is not confused in projection . as we have previously shown using simulated data sets ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , this assumption may frequently _ not _ be satisfied for moderate - density condensations , although for rarer high - density peaks it probably is . with a suitable source function and radiative transfer scheme , it is possible to generated simulated @xmath13 data cubes for molecular transitions with varying critical densities , and thus to ascertain exactly when @xmath14 is expected to be a valid surrogate for @xmath15 .",
    "we defer consideration of this interesting and important problem to a later publication .    for the present work , we take advantage of our direct access to all three spatial coordinates in simulated data to study clumps in the unprojected density field .",
    "we associate clumps with spatial maxima in the density in much the same way that clumpfind associates clumps with maxima in the intensity .",
    "our algorithm operates as follows .",
    "find all density maxima @xmath16 . then associate every zone @xmath17 that lies above a threshold density @xmath18 with the nearest @xmath16 .",
    "each @xmath16 , together with the surrounding material that lies above the threshold density , is then a clump .",
    "this algorithm is easy to implement and explain .",
    "it has one parameter @xmath18 .",
    "a potential problem is that the density may contain small variation near the density maxima ( are the grand tetons one mountain , or three ? ) .",
    "if these variations occur on the grid scale , they may be purely numerical in origin .",
    "we can test the degree to which these variations split up what would otherwise be single clumps by smoothing the density and picking @xmath16 to be maxima of the smoothed density .",
    "this introduces one additional parameter , the smoothing length @xmath19 .",
    "what is the relationship of the 3d clumps described here with those seen by observers , in projection ?",
    "as mentioned above , preliminary work ( @xcite ) indicates that projection effects can be important . in each section below we will apply the same clump analysis to both the column density and the density as a way of evaluating the importance of projection effects .",
    "we evolve the equations of isothermal , self - gravitating , compressible , ideal mhd using a numerical method based on the zeus code @xcite .",
    "it is a time - explicit , operator - split finite difference algorithm on a staggered mesh .",
    "density and internal energy are zone - centered , while velocity components live on zone faces .",
    "the magnetic portion of the code uses the `` method of characteristics '' to evolve the transverse components of the magnetic and velocity field in a manner that assures the accurate propagation of alfvn waves . the magnetic field",
    "is represented by fluxes through zone faces ; these fluxes are evolved using `` constrained transport , '' @xcite which preserves the constraint @xmath20 to machine precision .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is obtained by differencing the gravitational potential .",
    "the potential is calculated using a fourier transform technique .",
    "the gravitational kernel is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "this kernel ensures that the natural finite difference form of the poisson equation is satisfied .",
    "notice that in a periodic domain the poisson equation becomes @xmath22 evidently the periodic boundary conditions alter the potential from what it would be in an isolated cloud .",
    "the difference is most pronounced away from density maxima . in regions with @xmath23",
    "the potential is less affected by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this can be verified by explicit construction of sheetlike equilibria , which we have done .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state @xmath24 , @xmath25 this models the effect of efficient heating and cooling , and is appropriate when the cooling time is much shorter than the dynamical time .",
    "numerical convergence is a serious concern for the calculations presented here , particularly for the case of clumps that are only a few zones in size .",
    "the self - gravitating isothermal mhd equations will , under a broad range of circumstances , evolve toward density singularities ( i.e. stars ) that are unresolved .",
    "many aspects of `` protostellar '' turbulence , however , may be insensitive to the internal structure of small , high - density regions .",
    "certainly this is the assumption on which our numerical investigation is undertaken . at a minimum ,",
    "however , we must only measure quantities on well - resolved scales .",
    "this paper considers a set of three numerical models which differ in magnetic field strength .",
    "several aspects of evolution and structure for the same three models have previously been investigated by @xcite .",
    "each model has a numerical resolution of @xmath26 zones .",
    "the models are evolved in a periodic cubic domain of length @xmath27 .",
    "the initial density and magnetic field are uniform .",
    "the initial velocity field , @xmath28 , is chosen to be a divergence - free gaussian random field with power spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "this slope is compatible with larson s law ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the perturbations have @xmath30 , although initially @xmath31 .",
    "no further perturbations are added over the course of the evolution ; these are _ decay _ simulations .",
    "an important parameter of the model is the strength of selfgravity . at fixed physical density and sound speed ,",
    "this strength is directly related to the physical size of the model @xmath27 .",
    "a suitable nondimensional parametrization is in terms of the `` jeans number '' @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "all models discussed here have @xmath34 .",
    "a second parameter is the strength of the mean magnetic field , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 indicates a volume average .",
    "@xmath37 can not change over time because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a sense of the dynamical importance of the mean field may be had by first comparing @xmath38 to the sound speed @xmath39 .",
    "our models have @xmath40 ( `` weak '' field ) , @xmath41 ( `` moderate '' field ) , and @xmath42 ( `` strong '' field ) .",
    "the strong and moderate field cases are most consistent with observations ( e.g. @xcite ; but see @xcite for a different perspective ) .",
    "one may also compare the mean field strength to that required to prevent gravitational collapse : @xmath43 ( tomisaka 1988a , b ) . in terms of our dimensionless parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 , this becomes @xmath46 .",
    "models which satisfy this condition are _ subcritical _ , i.e. , will never experience complete gravitational collapse , while systems which fail to satisfy it are _ supercritical_. in the present work , the strong field model is subcritical and the other two models are supercritical .",
    "once the model evolution is started , the initially incompressive velocity field distorts the initially uniform magnetic field . since the magnetic field distortions are typically large , in the sense that @xmath47 , they couple strongly to compressive motions , and density variations result .",
    "density variations also result from exchange of power between the compressive and incompressive parts of the velocity field ; this would occur even in the absence of a magnetic field . because the initial power spectrum of velocities we have chosen has @xmath48 , the velocity variation at a scale @xmath49 , varying as @xmath50 , and the timescale for a density variation to form is @xmath51 , the density variations appear first at the smallest scales . within a dynamical time , @xmath52 ,",
    "density variations have appeared at all scales and the flow is fully turbulent .",
    "each run begins with a kinetic energy of @xmath53 , which is equivalent to an r.m.s .",
    "mach number ( @xmath54 ) of @xmath55 .",
    "this kinetic energy is rapidly reduced by work done in bending the mean field and in compressing the isothermal fluid .",
    "it is also dissipated in shocks .",
    "the total `` wave energy '' ( difference between the energy and that of the initial state in the absence of perturbations ) dissipates on a timescale of order @xmath52 , or @xmath56 .",
    "figure 1 shows a color - coded image of the surface density in the middle of one run ( * b * ) ; here black is low density and red is high density .",
    "in this paper we study a set of three identical experiments that differ only in the strength of the mean field . these are designated runs * a*(strong field , @xmath57 ) , * b*(moderate field , @xmath58 ) , and * c*(weak field , @xmath59 ) .",
    "model * a *  is subcritical , and models * b *  and * c *  are supercritical .",
    "runs * b *  and * c *  undergo gravitational collapse in the sense that at some locations the density becomes very large . in run",
    "* a *  the peak density rises to about @xmath60 after the simulation begins and then drops to only @xmath61 at the end of simulation .",
    "in contrast , the peak density rises almost monotonically in runs * b *  and * c * , and at final stages , reaches @xmath62 ( * b * ) and @xmath63 ( * c * ) . note that this density violates the truelove criterion since @xmath39 is constant in space and time , we can rewrite the truelove criterion as @xmath64 ; here @xmath65 is the number of resolution elements along each axis , @xmath27 is the size of the box , and @xmath66 , the `` truelove number '' must be larger than about @xmath67 . in simulations units",
    "this becomes @xmath68 .",
    "therefore we are not resolving the internal dynamics of the clump with the highest peak density .",
    "] @xcite . at the end of * b",
    "* , the fraction of the mass lying at densities greater than ( @xmath69)@xmath70 is ( @xmath71)% . at the end of * c * , the fraction of the mass lying at densities greater than ( @xmath69)@xmath70 is ( @xmath72)% . thus while high density , collapsed regions do develop in both supercritical runs , only a small fraction of the mass is in the highest density regions .",
    "the fraction of mass we find in collapsing regions is consistent with observations of the efficiency of star formation in giant molecular clouds as a whole ( e.g. , the @xmath73 found by @xcite ) .    from each of the simulations we have picked a set of `` snapshots '' to study intensively .",
    "they are labeled according to the run and evolution time ( see table 1 ) .",
    "run * b * , the moderate field ( @xmath58 ) run , is our `` fiducial '' run , i.e. the one we believe is most similar to a molecular cloud .",
    "snapshot * b*9 is our fiducial snapshot , since it is evolved enough that the velocity and magnetic field have had a chance to relax , but not so evolved that all turbulence has decayed away .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the procedure for obtaining the apparent axis ratio of a 3d clump was described in  [ shapdef ] .",
    "if we apply this procedure to every clump and average over many viewing angles , we can obtain a mean , or expected distribution for @xmath74 .",
    "figure 8 ( solid line ) shows the distribution of the apparent axis ratios obtained from * b*9 , as well as the result from m17sw @xcite .",
    "crudely speaking , the two distributions are consistent in the sense that both show a characteristic absence of nearly round objects .",
    "it is this absence that most strongly rules out a parent population of oblate spheroids @xcite .",
    "the @xmath74 changes with time in the sense that the mean apparent axis ratio increases .",
    "in fact , @xmath74 for snapshots * b*11 and * b*19 lies within the error bounds permitted by the observations .",
    "a similar increase in the mean apparent axis ratio with time is seen in run * c *  ( the clumps become rounder with time ) , but not run * a*.    our discussion up to now has concerned apparent axis ratios of individual clumps .",
    "clumps exhibit considerable overlap ( `` confusion '' ) , however , so the distribution of axis ratios of apparent ( 2d ) clumps may be different from the distribution of apparent axis ratios of real ( 3d ) clumps seen in projection .",
    "figure 9 shows a comparison between the former ( 2d clumps obtained from a single line of sight projection ) and the m17 observations . broadly speaking",
    ", they are consistent with each other and the 2d clumps also show the absence of round clumps .",
    "steady - state theoretical models of magnetically supported clouds suggest that clouds should be flattened perpendicular to the magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) or , in the language of this paper , that the clump minor axis should be nearly parallel to the local field .",
    "observations by @xcite ( also @xcite ) suggest , however , that cloud minor axes are not correlated with the local field direction .",
    "recent observations showing alignment ( @xcite ) are for a small number of clumps in individual clouds and probably do not indicate a statistically significant alignment . here",
    "we examine correlations between the clump principal axes and the _ density - weighted _ mean field within clumps , as well as the mean global fields , @xmath75 .",
    "figure 11 shows the distribution of the dot product of the clump short axis unit vector ( @xmath76 ) and the unit vector associated with the density weighted mean magnetic field in the clump ( @xmath77 ) in snapshot * b*9 .",
    "the dashed line shows the distribution expected if both vectors are chosen at random .",
    "evidently there is no strong correlation between the mean local field and the clump minor axis .",
    "figure 12 shows a similar plot for 3d clumps in projection , also for * b*9 .",
    "the distribution is obtained as follows : for a fixed viewing angle , we use the same procedure described in  5 to obtain the principal axes of the projected clump , as well as the density - weighted magnetic field vector within each clump .",
    "averaging over @xmath78 viewing angles gives the distribution .",
    "again there is no strong correlation between the local mean field and the clump minor axis .",
    "a more complete description of alignment statistics is given in table 3 .",
    "there we list , for each of the snapshots , the fractional alignment of clump axes and the global and local mean fields .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 , for example , is the fraction of all clumps with @xmath80 , i.e. the fraction of all clumps with major axis closer than @xmath81 to the local mean field .",
    "similarly , @xmath82 is the fraction of all clumps with intermediate axis closer than @xmath81 to the local mean field , etc .",
    "table 3 also describes the alignment of clump axes with the global volume mean magnetic field with unit vector @xmath83 .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is the fraction of all clumps with @xmath85 .",
    "the only significant global alignment is in the late stages of the strong field run , when the short axis has a weak tendency to line up with the global mean field .",
    "notice that if clump magnetic fields are randomly oriented with respect to the clump principal axes , _ and _ if the orientation of each clump is independent , we expect @xmath86 at the @xmath87 confidence level , where @xmath65 is the number of clumps ( and similarly for @xmath88 , etc . ) .",
    "this nave estimate for the dispersion in alignments is not accurate because clump orientations are probably spatially correlated ( i.e. not independent ) .",
    "for example consider run * c * , whose weak initial field makes any global alignments physically implausible .",
    "nevertheless , * c *  exhibits global alignments that are `` statistically significant '' according to our nave estimate .",
    "the only significant and physically plausible alignments occur in run * a * , where we find that the minor axis tends to be weakly aligned with the field .",
    "the longest axis also tends to be anti - aligned with the field .",
    "this is similar to what might be expected from an equilibrium model , except that the clump shapes tend to be dominantly prolate or triaxial rather than oblate .",
    "table 3 also describes the alignment of projected mean field vectors with the principal axes of the projected moment of inertia tensor .",
    "these alignments are given in the final two columns ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which are the fraction of clumps with projected field less than @xmath81 from the projected clump major and minor axes , respectively ) .",
    "for randomly oriented clumps we expect @xmath91 .",
    "the projected alignments are sensitive to viewing angle , so the values shown have been averaged over @xmath78 uniformly distributed viewing angles .",
    "the only plausible alignments are in run * a * ; other snapshots show at best marginally significant alignments . to sum up",
    ", our numerical models suggest that projected alignments are weak and not a useful diagnostic of field strength .",
    "clump principal axis alignments , like the mass spectrum , are sensitive to the smoothing parameter @xmath19 . for example , if @xmath92 we see an implausible set of alignments in run * c*. presumably this is because we are studying alignments near the grid scale .",
    "this is one of the motivations for introducing a finite @xmath19 .",
    "observations suggest that rotation is not important in supporting clumps against gravitational collapse since rotational energy is small compared to the gravitational potential energy ( e.g. @xcite ) . however",
    ", once collapse takes place , angular momentum may play an important role in determining the characteristics of the system to be formed , e.g. , the size of circumstellar disks , or the separation of the stars in a multiple star system .",
    "clumps or cores are observed to have greater specific angular momentum @xmath93 than binary or multiple star systems .",
    "consider a binary with masses of @xmath94 for both members and a period of @xmath95 years .",
    "the specific angular momentum of this system is @xmath96 .",
    "this is typical for young binary t tauri stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . for single protostars and the envelope ,",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath97 for two iras sources ( for circumstellar disks , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as for dense cores , the results given by @xcite range from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .    we have examined the specific angular momenta of the simulated clumps , and find that the values are greater than @xmath100 . in figure 13",
    "we show the distribution of specific angular momenta of clumps in * b*9 .",
    "clump specific angular momenta span about @xmath101 decades , e.g. , from @xmath102 to @xmath103 , the peak is at @xmath104 ; the range of the distribution decreases with time in * b *  and * c *  snapshots ( we can not say much about run * a*because there are not many clumps in later snapshots ) .",
    "there is no clear trend in clump specific angular momentum with mass .",
    "our distribution of specific angular momenta may be compared to those found by @xcite ( hereafter bb ) , who studied clump models in which the internal velocities are drawn from a gaussian random field at a spatial scale @xmath105 ; their power spectrum ( @xmath106 ) was normalized to match the typical velocity dispersion in the @xcite sample of cores .",
    "their distribution peaks at @xmath107 , while ours peaks at @xmath108 .",
    "this difference is attributable to the following factors .",
    "first , our sample contains both nonself - gravitating and self - gravitating clumps , while bb s clumps are scaled to match self - gravitating clumps .",
    "second , the self - gravitating clumps in our sample are more massive ( by a factor of about @xmath67 ) than bb s using our standard scaling .",
    "third , the self - gravitating clumps have lower mean specific angular momentum ( by about @xmath109 ) than the nonself - gravitating clumps .",
    "fourth , while bb chose a gaussian clump density profile , our clumps have substantial envelopes that can make a significant contribution to clump angular momentum .",
    "we conclude that the difference is not significant .",
    "the main results of this paper are :    \\1 .",
    "clumps are triaxial .",
    "clumps that are `` prolate '' or `` triaxial '' ( in the sense defined in  5 ) make up @xmath110 of the clump population .",
    "clumps that are `` oblate '' make up only @xmath111 of the clump population .",
    "the distribution of clump shapes implies a distribution of apparent axis ratios that is consistent with observations .",
    "we do not see any signs of the sort of oblate equilibria that have been the focus of earlier studies of magnetized clouds emerging in our simulations .",
    "but we have not considered the most general possible set of initial states ( we assume the mass - to - flux ratio is uniform ) , nor have we included the effects of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the possibility of triaxial cloud cores has also been explored by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , suggested that the short axis should be aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "this is not seen in our numerical models . the absence of magnetically supported equilibria in self - gravitating , turbulent mhd models has also been noted by several other workers in the field , perhaps most forcefully by @xcite . the emergence of such equilibria in supersonic , self - gravitating turbulence can not yet be ruled out , however , because the effects of ambipolar diffusion , varying mass to flux ratios , and varying initial conditions have not yet been studied .",
    "clump principal axes are not strongly aligned with the magnetic field , either locally or globally .",
    "we would not expect to see such alignments in observations , nor are they currently observed .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields on cloud structure has been considered earlier by @xcite .",
    "they found that only strong fields produce an observable effect on the density structure based on a qualitative analysis .",
    "a similar result was seen at late stages of self - gravitating evolution in the strong - field models of @xcite .",
    "the simulated clump mass spectrum has a characteristic mass of @xmath112 ( for an assumed mean cloud density and temperature ) . while this result is suggestive , it depends on some of the choices made in setting up our simulations , including numerical resolution .",
    "it is possible that the characteristic mass scales with the total cloud mass or with the sonic mach number or density of the initial conditions .",
    "these scalings have not yet been explored .",
    "the high - mass wing of the clump mass spectrum has a slope that is crudely consistent with the salpeter law , although other , non - power - law forms for the mass spectrum may well be consistent with our data .",
    "other numerical work on the clump mass spectrum by @xcite is generally consistent with our results .",
    "these models include similar physics to ours , although some models lack selfgravity @xcite , while others lack magnetic fields @xcite .    the simulations of @xcite are the most similar to those analyzed here .",
    "differences in padoan et al.s analytical methods limit the possibility of detailed comparisons , however : their definition of a self - gravitating clump does not include turbulent kinetic energy ; the mass spectra presented are composites of two models with gas temperatures that differ by a factor of three ; their definition of a clump depends on contrast of local peaks rather than a density threshold . nevertheless , the results of the two analyses for the position of the peak of the mass spectrum , as well as for the slope of the high - mass end , are broadly consistent .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use a completely different numerical method ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) and include selfgravity but not magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , they allow dense regions to turn into `` sink '' particles .",
    "this allows them to continue the evolution much further in time than is possible in our calculations .",
    "the trends we find of an increasingly flat high - end spectrum , and a larger proportion of mass in bound objects , are clearly evident in their distributions at sequential evolutionary stages .",
    "their clump mass spectra are again crudely consistent with ours ; minor differences in mass scale and shape may arise due to differences in initial conditions or input parameters ( number of jeans masses ) .",
    "we can not evaluate this without a direct attempt to reproduce their models .",
    "recently , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have proposed that the clump mass spectrum , and consequently the mass function of collapsing cores , may be predicted solely from three macroscopic quantities averaged over the entire cloud : density , temperature , and velocity dispersion .",
    "although this theory is attractive in many way , the stationary turbulent state adopted for the @xcite may not be a good approximation for real star forming regions .",
    "clouds are transient structures , and a cloud may have developed its current mean density , temperature , and velocity dispersion in many ways .",
    "our analysis of purely decaying models shows that some aspects of the mass spectrum are invariant in time ( e.g. @xmath113 ) even as the mach number decreases , while other aspects of the mass spectrum ( the fraction of self - gravitating clumps ) increase secularly with time .",
    "both of these results suggest that a cloud retains a memory of its dynamical history that may be important for establishing the stellar imf .",
    "clump specific angular momenta are an order of magnitude larger than in a `` typical '' binary system .",
    "it is interesting that our simulations give clump angular momenta that are so close to the angular momenta of binary systems .",
    "this suggests that we are close to resolving the lengthscale where the angular momentum of binaries is determined ( since @xmath114 in molecular clouds and in supersonic turbulence generally , the specific angular momentum @xmath115 , so @xmath116 ) .",
    "future higher resolution numerical models , perhaps with an adaptive mesh , will resolve this scale and may be capable of directly simulating binary formation .",
    "our results all depend on how the clumps are defined .",
    "because fragmentation during gravitational collapse may decide the final stellar mass function , characterizing the hierarchy of clumpy structure and understanding its consequences may be very important .",
    "mass functions are steeper when clumps - within - clumps are counted rather than discounted ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; whether gravity eventually selects the larger or smaller scale of a nested structure depends on the details of the collapse .",
    "more general tools ( e.g. wavelet methods ) for analyzing the density field will be valuable in characterizing this hierarchical structure .",
    "future analyses should also focus on direct analogues of observable clumps ( e.g. simulated clumps in position - position - velocity space for common molecular tracers ) , although self - consistent treatments of thermodynamics , radiative transfer , and molecular chemistry may ultimately be necessary for realistic source functions ."
