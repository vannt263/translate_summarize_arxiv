    "beyond spectral type @xmath2m7 ( ultracool dwarfs ) , h@xmath3 and x - ray luminosities drop sharply , signaling that chromospheric and coronal heating becomes less efficient , even in the presence of rapid rotation @xcite . despite this reduction in quiescent emission ,",
    "a number of h@xmath3 and x - ray flares have been detected , indicating that chromospheric and coronal activity is indeed present @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , given the absence of quiescent emission at higher energies , @xcite reported persistent radio emission from lp 944 - 20 ( m9 ) - the first detection of radio emission from a brown dwarf , orders of magnitude higher than the expected flux @xcite .    to date , quiescent radio emission has been detected from ten ultracool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "probably the most surprising aspect of this radio activity , has been the detection of periodic 100% circularly polarized pulses @xcite .",
    "observations by @xcite of tvlm 513 - 46546 ( henceforth tvlm 513 ) , reveal electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) emission as the mechanism responsible for these 100% circularly polarized periodic pulses , implying kilogauss ( kg ) magnetic field strengths in a large - scale stable magnetic field configuration .",
    "this is consistent with the confirmation of kg magnetic field strengths for ultracool dwarfs via zeeman broadening observations @xcite .",
    "although these observations confirmed the ecm process to be the cause of the polarized periodic emission , it is still unclear as to which mechanism ( incoherent or coherent ) is driving the quiescent component of the radio emission , and incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission has alternatively been invoked @xcite .",

    "these investigations have yielded both optical and infrared ( ir ) variability , where modulation at the expected rotation period has been found in various studies @xcite .",
    "aperiodic variability , as well as periodic modulations on time - scales not associated with rotation , have been inferred @xcite .",
    "typically , this variability has been attributed to magnetic spots on the surface of the dwarf , or the presence of atmospheric dust , or indeed both .",
    "for higher temperature ultracool dwarfs ( specifically late - m and early - l dwarfs ) , the presence of magnetic spots and other magnetic related activity , as seen for earlier m - dwarfs , may be present @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported sinusoidal variability of the m9 dwarf tvlm 513 , with a period of @xmath02 hours - a period consistent with the radio pulsing and optical periodicity previously obtained by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , their light curves ( sloan @xmath7 and sloan @xmath8 ) were anticorrelated , which seemed to refute the proposed model of starspots at that time as the cause for the optical variability .",
    "instead they argued that this anticorrelated signal was likely due to photospheric dust coupled with stellar rotation .",
    "indeed , magnetic activity , as signaled by h@xmath3 , decreases further after the m / l transition @xcite , therefore in most cases optical variability has been attributed to the expected presence of dust in the dwarf s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "it is notable that two of the ultracool dwarfs found to be periodically variable in the optical @xcite , are also known to be members of the small sample known to be pulsing radio sources @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we have commenced a campaign to investigate whether optical periodic variability is a signature property of radio detected ultracool dwarfs . to this end",
    ", we employed the custom developed gufi mk.ii photometer , as well as the vatt 4k ccd imager on the 1.83 m vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt ) , to photometrically monitor all of the radio emitting ultracool dwarfs observable from the vatt site . throughout the campaign",
    ", data were also obtained from the 1.0 m and 1.55 m telescopes at the usno , as well as the 1.52 m telescope at the loiano observatory in bologna , italy .",
    "in the following sections we discuss each target with respect to any previous radio and optical emission . a list of the campaign sample , as well as a summary of individual target information , is shown in table  [ table_target_properties ] .",
    "these are categorized in order of ascending spectral type ; we also outline details of the respective observation campaigns .",
    "our target sample consists of those dwarfs which have been previously detected as radio sources and are visible from the vatt observatory site .",
    "the general capabilities of each detector used for the campaign are outlined in   [ optical_obs ] .",
    "dwarfs which have been detected as optically variable sources in other work were also included for verification , and to assess the stability of these optical signals over time scales of years .",
    "we selected two very low mass binary stars at the m / l transition for our campaign - lp 349 - 25 and 2 m j0746 .",
    "these objects were of particular interest , since they are the only binary dwarfs reported thus far to exhibit radio emission in the very low mass ( vlm ) binary regime @xcite , defined to be @xmath9 @xmath100.185 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both objects were subject to high - precision dynamical mass measurements @xcite , and more recently a large campaign was carried out to establish the _ individual _ rotational velocities of each binary component @xcite - the first resolved ao measurements of this kind . based on these dynamical mass and rotational velocity measurements , an accurate period of rotation",
    "provides the means of assessing the system s orbital coplanarity .",
    "moreover , a range of radii can also be estimated .",
    "importantly , @xcite have recently reported alignment of the spin - orbital axes of 2 m j0746ab .",
    "thus , the discovery of a rotation period from the binary lp 349 - 25 has allowed us to investigate this possible alignment for another vlm system .",
    "the m tight binary dwarf lp 349 - 25 was reported as a quiescent radio source by @xcite and @xcite ; however no radio pulsing has been found thus far .",
    "more recently , a rotational velocity study carried out by @xcite of individual components of very low mass binaries , including lp 349 - 25 , yielded a _ v _ sin _",
    "i _ of 55 @xmath1 2 km s@xmath12 and 83 @xmath1 3 km s@xmath12 for lp 349 - 25a and lp 349 - 25b , respectively . under the assumption of a rotational axis which is orthogonal to the orbital plane @xcite , the inferred equatorial velocities are @xmath062 km s@xmath12 and @xmath095 km s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "this would make lp 349 - 25b the fastest rotating low mass object yet discovered .",
    "thus far , no optical variability has been detected for lp 349 - 25 .",
    "we therefore chose to monitor the binary to investigate the presence of optical variability .",
    "we used vatt r - band and i - band broadband filters for observations with gufi mk.ii over the course of three separate epochs , for a total of @xmath064 hours , spanning @xmath01.2 years .",
    "2 m j0746 is an l dwarf binary with a separation of @xmath02.7 au @xcite .",
    "the first detection of confirmed radio emission was reported by @xcite during a 2 hour observation , and following this observation , @xcite reported periodic radio emission of 2.07 @xmath1 0.002 hours , as well as quasi - sinusoidal periodic h@xmath3 emission with the same period .",
    "@xcite proposed that the source of the periodicity in both cases was coming from the same component of the binary , that of 2 m j0746a , and calculated a magnetic field strength of @xmath01.7 kg , which was in agreement with @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the first resolved _ v _ sin _ i _ measurements of the system .",
    "they measure a _ v _ sin _",
    "i _ of 19 @xmath1 2 km s@xmath12 , and 33 @xmath1 2 km s@xmath12 , for 2 m j0746a and 2 m j0746b , respectively .",
    "previously , in terms of rotation period measurement in optical photometry , there were only rough estimates based on unresolved _ v _ sin _ i _ data ( with reported periods of 1.84 - 5.28 hours , see @xcite ) , as well as some photometric variability which was detected by @xcite , showing weak evidence of periodicity of a few hours .",
    "@xcite reported a period of 3.32 @xmath1 0.15 hours for 2 m j0746a , inferring that @xcite in fact detected the secondary in the radio .",
    "this refuted the claimed radius of 0.78 @xmath1 0.1 @xmath13 for 2 m j0746a , which @xcite demonstrate to be 0.99 @xmath1 0.03 @xmath13 .",
    "a total of @xmath062 hours of multiple epoch i - band observations were obtained over @xmath02 years to investigate the long - term behavior of the optical variability on time scales of years .",
    "these observations were taken with the vatt 4k system as well as the gufi mk.ii photometer .",

    "i _ of 50 @xmath1 5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected radio emission from lsr j1835 during a @xmath02 hour observation , and proposed incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation was responsible with an associated field strength of @xmath530 g. @xcite later observed the dwarf for 11 hours using the vla , and reported persistent 100% circularly polarized coherent pulses of radio emission with a period of 2.84 @xmath1 0.01 hours , which they attributed to the dwarf s rotation period .",
    "they argue in favor of electron cyclotron maser ( ecm ) emission as the dominant source of the pulsed radio emission , requiring magnetic fields of @xmath03 kg .    based on the above radio activity of lsr j1835",
    ", we decided to further investigate the presence of such variability at optical wavelengths , and whether it was periodic in nature like the optical periodic variability presented by @xcite for the m9 dwarf tvlm 513 .",
    "we conducted observations over a period of @xmath03 years , encompassing three separate epochs .",
    "initial epochs were taken as test data only for the gufi mk.i system in july 2006 in the johnson i - band , using the 1.52 m telescope in loiano , bologna , italy .",
    "we also include johnson i - band and r - band data from the usno 1.55 m telescope in flagstaff , arizona , obtained by group members in september 2006 . finally , we observed the dwarf in the vatt i - band with the gufi mk.ii system on the 1.83 m vatt telescope , mt .",
    "graham , arizona , to confirm its periodic nature in june 2009 .",
    "the three epochs contain @xmath033 hours of observations on source .",
    "tvlm 513 is one of the most rapidly rotating ultracool dwarfs discovered thus far with a rotation rate of @xmath060 km s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "all the same , only weak levels of h@xmath3 have been found in its spectrum @xcite , with no x - ray detections reported so far .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected transient radio emission from tvlm 513 , however no obvious flaring was found .",
    "@xcite then reported persistent periodic radio emission with a period of @xmath02 hours . following this",
    ", @xcite revealed periodic bursts of radio emission with a period of @xmath01.96 hours - confirming the presence of kg magnetic field strengths based on broadband , ecm coherent radio emission .",
    "these observations were conducted simultaneously to a photometric monitoring campaign by @xcite , who also detected a periodic signal of @xmath01.96 hours in photometric i - band data ( attributed to magnetic spots ) , establishing that the periodicity was due to the rotational modulation of the star , as put forward by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite instead propose that atmospheric dust was responsible , after reporting anti - correlated sloan _",
    "g@xmath14 _ and _ @xmath8 _ periodic variability of the m9 dwarf . periodic h@xmath3 and h@xmath15 variability has also be reported @xcite , perhaps indicating the presence of localized heating in the dwarf s chromospheric regions .",
    "we observed tvlm 513 in optical photometric vatt i - band observations with gufi mk.ii on vatt in june 2009 , in addition to three additional i - band epochs in february and april 2011 , and in may 2011 using the the vatt 4k ccd and a sloan _ @xmath8 _ filter .",
    "data taken by members of the group using the usno 1.0 m telescope is also included , from an epoch in 2008 , and earlier vatt data obtained in 2006 .",
    "this baseline therefore extends for @xmath05 years encompassing @xmath053 hours of data .      in a campaign investigating magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs",
    ", @xcite found steady and variable h@xmath3 emission from bri 0021 on a @xmath00.5 - 2 hour time - scale , albeit no detected radio emission , despite previous low - level detections of radio emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reported a weak h@xmath3 flare .",
    "other optical variability has been reported by @xcite , who find i - band variability during multi - epoch photometric observations with some evidence of periodicity ( @xmath020 hours and @xmath04.8 hours ) in their analysis .",
    "they argue that since the dwarf appeared to have low levels of magnetic activity , the variability was probably not due to surface spots , but rather due to dust clouds in the dwarf s atmosphere - since the presence of silicate and iron clouds are expected based on the dwarf s spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is a rapidly rotating dwarf with a _ v",
    "@xmath16 34 km s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "based on the above radio and optical studies , we observed the dwarf in broadband optical photometry with gufi mk.ii , and obtained @xmath028 hours of i - band data over three epochs of @xmath01.2 years of separation .",
    "2 m j0036 is a radio active ultracool dwarf with rotation velocity estimates of @xmath015 km s@xmath12 , 38 km s@xmath12 and 36 km s@xmath12 , respectively , based on a number of studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the presence of highly variable , periodic radio emission , with a period of @xmath03 hours .",
    "this level of radio emission violated the gdel - benz relationship by many orders of magnitude ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they interpret the emission as incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation , with a corresponding magnetic field strength of 175 g. however , @xcite reported 2 m j0036 to be once again a persistent source of radio emission , and based on the periodic presence of 100% circularly polarized emission , ruled out gyrosynchrotron radiation and confirmed ecm emission as the mechanism responsible for the pulsed radio emission .",
    "this required a magnetic field strength of at least 1.7 kg , which was the first confirmation of kg magnetic field strengths for an l dwarf .",
    "prior to these observations , @xcite conducted photometric i - band observations of 2 m j0036 , and found the dwarf to be photometrically variable , with a periodicity of @xmath03 hours , arguing that magnetic spots on the surface of the dwarf , coupled with the rotation of the star , were a likely source of the periodicity .",
    "some evidence of aperiodic variability was also present , which they attribute to dust clouds in the cooler l dwarf atmosphere .",
    "we chose to observe 2 m j0036 in optical photometry in the same optical band as @xcite to determine whether the optical periodicity was present over time - scales of years .",
    "we used gufi mk.ii on vatt at i - band wavelengths , for two nights in december 2010 , for a total of @xmath010 hours .",

    "differential photometry was obtained by dividing the target flux by the mean flux of selected reference stars .",
    "although changing seeing conditions can ultimately introduce photometric errors , for all observations we ensured that the photometric parameters remained constant for all stars - this allowed the same fraction of total flux to be observed in the aperture of each source .",

    "considering the spectral range in our survey ( @xmath51m7.5 - l3.5 ) compared to this same range in the above studies of late - m and early - to - mid l dwarfs , less than 5% of objects studied have _ confirmed _ periodic variability consistent with the rotation period @xcite .    our study has confirmed periodic optical variability for five out of six radio active dwarfs , with a tentative detection of similar behavior in the sixth ; the latter case limited by poor sampling of the rotational phase of the object .",
    "however , a direct comparison to a large fraction of the above work will show that our sensitivities are much higher for detecting periodic variability in these objects ( see   [ optical_obs ] for gufi specs ) . throughout this campaign",
    ", we have consistently achieved photometric precisions of @xmath50.5% ( and as low as 0.15% for some observations ) as shown in table  [ table_amp_var ] , as well as sampling many rotation periods per object , per night . by contrast",
    ", the above studies have typically achieved photometric precisions of @xmath511.0% ( with some as low as @xmath00.5% ) , and in many cases the rotational phase has been poorly covered .",
    "furthermore , large - survey data sets only produced a few data points per hour in order to contemporaneously monitor a large number of objects .",
    "a combination of high photometric precision , well sampled rotational phase coverage and high cadence data sets , are perhaps crucial in effectively detecting periodic variability from ultracool dwarfs on these time scales .",
    "in particular , we highlight that two of our sample , 2 m j0746ab and 2 m j0036 , were included in surveys mentioned above @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "variability was detected , albeit with insufficient phase coverage to recover the periodic signal detected in our work .",
    "however , we cite @xcite and @xcite as reliable comparison studies ( with similar sensitivities to the periodic variability reported in this work ) that searched for variability ( including periodic variability ) in a sample of dwarfs that were not pre - selected as radio detected .",
    "we select objects in these papers between @xmath51m7.5 - l3.5 only , in order to satisfy a direct comparison to the objects in this work . in the case of @xcite",
    ", they observed 21 m and l type dwarfs , where 15 of these occupy the spectral range we define above .",
    "similarly , @xcite cover a sample of 19 m dwarfs , where 6 of these are m7.5 - m9 .",
    "crucially , their work provided detection limits of @xmath00.5 - 5% in the peak to peak amplitude variations of variable targets .",
    "in addition to this , the methods of @xcite were sensitive to periods @xmath61 hour , and @xcite for @xmath00.5 - 12 hours .",
    "therefore , based on the peak to peak amplitudes detected in our work , their studies both had the capability of detecting the presence of periodic variability in their sample .",
    "however , although @xcite report evidence of some periodic signals , they only report tentative detections from some targets . similarly ,",
    "@xcite detect periodic optical variability from only 1 source out of 6 - the m9 dwarf 2massw j1707183 + 643933 . during these observations , they also report a large flare event @xcite , and as a result argue that the presence of magnetic activity is expected .",
    "@xcite reported h@xmath3 emission for the same m9 dwarf with an equivalent width of 9.8 , further supporting the possible presence of magnetic activity .",
    "the presence of consistent periodic variability in five of six radio detected ultracool dwarfs demonstrates that the correlation between optical and radio periodic variability is significant and thus the presence of magnetic activity is also significant when compared to the above studies .",
    "we therefore have a case to highlight an expected presence of consistent periodic optical variability in radio detected sources , due to the presence of strong magnetic fields ( kg ) with radio activity .",
    "we note further that all of our target sample are rapid rotators , with high _ v _ sin _ i _ values ( @xmath615 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "this is perhaps an additional bias in our data , whereby rapid rotators could be easier detected than slowly rotating sources .",
    "however , an expanded sample of non radio - active dwarfs that are also rapid rotators , is required to quantify this further .",
    "previous studies have argued that magnetic spots , ( e.g. @xcite ) or dust ( e.g. @xcite ) were responsible for similar detected periodicities in ultracool dwarfs .",
    "one possible means of distinguishing between various mechanisms is to compare simultaneous multi - band photometry to synthetic atmospheric models @xcite .",
    "importantly , in order to carry out such analyses , simultaneous observations are needed due to the inherent variability in the amplitude of the optical variability .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite , for example , yielded cases in favor of both cool magnetic spots and the presence of atmospheric dust , respectively .",
    "these results were based on the ratios of the peak to peak amplitude variations at different photometric wavebands . despite detecting larger peak to peak amplitude variations in r - band vs. i - band for two of our target sample ( see table  [ table_amp_var ] ) , we did not obtain simultaneous photometry and therefore can not apply these models at this point .",
    "however , such a high detection rate of significant periodic variability in our sample of radio active dwarfs , implies a correlation with radio activity and thus some kind of magnetic phenomenon .",
    "the nature of this optical variability will be addressed in an upcoming paper focused on spectro - photometric observations of such targets ( hallinan et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "a number of ultracool dwarfs have shown periodic behavior over a number of observations ( e.g. @xcite ) ; here we use multi - epoch observations of one dwarf , tvlm 513 , to investigate whether this periodicity is long term and stable in phase , and whether this modulation evolves morphologically over these time scales .",
    "we achieve an accurate enough period of rotation of 1.95958 hours for the dwarf via phase connection of the 2006 - 2011 epochs , with an associated error in the period of 0.00005 hours , thereby allowing us to assess its modulated behavior over the @xmath05 year campaign .",
    "we find long - term , periodic variability that is stable in phase as shown in figure  [ fig9 ] , where we overplot a model sinusoidal signal ( red ) over the entire baseline .",
    "phase folded light curves of individual observations are shown in _ plot 1 _ of figure  [ fig9 ] , once again highlighting this agreement , and similarly in _",
    "plots 6 & 7 _ we show phase folded light curves of all datasets .",
    "such a high degree of correlation suggests a spatially - stable surface feature that does not appear to move by a significant amount over this baseline .",
    "@xcite & @xcite have shown that large - scale magnetic fields for fully convective objects are stable on year - long time scales . @xcite have confirmed the presence of stable kg magnetic fields for tvlm 513 , consistent with a common magnetic field - related origin for the periodic radio and optical variability for ultracool dwarfs , as discussed in the previous section .    while stable in phase ,",
    "the peak to peak amplitude is variable during this campaign from @xmath00.56 - 1.20% in vatt i - band ( see table  [ table_amp_var ] ) .",
    "since the phase is stable , a change in amplitude suggests that the intensity of the feature responsible is changing on these levels , or that it may be changing in size .",
    "@xcite observed peak to peak variations in sloan @xmath8 of 0.15% . here",
    "we report much larger sloan @xmath8 peak to peak variability of 0.92 - 0.96% - further evidence of variable peak to peak amplitudes when compared to other studies .",
    "this is intriguing when compared to the previous radio activity discussed by @xcite , who reported highly variable signals from tvlm 513 .",
    "specifically , they detected bursts of periodic radio emission that varied greatly between epochs , also indicating changes in emission intensities .",
    "whether the optical emission here is directly related to radio variability will be conclusively determined when multiple epochs of radio data are obtained , and phase connected , over the same time scales as this work .      in this work ,",
    "we have demonstrated evidence of a correlation between the optical and radio variabilities in ultracool dwarfs .",
    "we therefore briefly consider why we detect optical periodic variability from the non - radio detected binary component of the 2 m j0746ab system .    according to model - derived temperature estimates of @xcite , the effective temperature of 2 m j0746a ( @xmath57 @xmath0 2205 @xmath1 50",
    "k ) is higher than its counterpart ( @xmath57 @xmath0 2060 @xmath1 70 k ) .",
    "as previously discussed , our photometry contains the combined flux of both stars - perhaps the contrast ratios of stellar photosphere vs. feature are much greater for 2 m j0746a as a result .",
    "if the optical and radio emission are linked as we put forward as a possibility , why did @xcite not also observe some evidence of radio emission from 2 m j0746a ?",
    "the primary could be pulsing at radio frequencies , but undetectable due to the inclination angle of the system .",
    "however , @xcite find that the 2 m j0746ab rotation axes are orthogonally aligned to the system orbital plane .",
    "this established alignment geometry could support detectable beaming from both stars .",
    "however , this is contingent upon the magnetic field alignment of each star being equal with respect to their rotation axes .",
    "misaligned magnetic field axes could mean that the radio emission from 2 m j0746a is being beamed away from observer .",
    "alternatively , unlike 2 m j0746b , it is also possible that 2 m j0746a does not exhibit beamed ecm emission at all , but perhaps only small levels of quiescent radio emission that has not yet been detected by previous studies of the system .",
    "speculating further about the intricacies of the system s radio emission and the associated beaming geometry is outside the scope of this work .",
    "some aperiodic variability is also present for some observations which could be due to the contribution from a weaker secondary signal .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram analysis in this work should extract both photometric signals if they are both present and strong enough , and our data shows strong evidence of variability of the non - radio emitting component . resolved photometry would be an interesting confirmation if the radio - active source is also optically variable .",
    "in this section we discuss the behavior of the light curves of the binary lp 349 - 25ab . as outlined in",
    "  [ binaries ] , we observe significant changes in amplitude in i - band ( refer to table  [ table_amp_var ] ) , as well as changes in phase during single observations . due to the close separation of the binary members ,",
    "the photometric aperture used enclosed the combined flux of both components .",
    "therefore the presence of two periodically varying sources in these data and thus the superposition of these waves is one possible explanation for the varying amplitude we observe here .",
    "however , aperiodic variability of a single periodic source could also cause this behavior .",
    "this is an obvious distinction and one that we discuss below .",
    "we first consider the possibility of the presence of two periodically varying sources by subtracting the main 1.86 hour period out of the raw data .",
    "we did this by generating a sinusoidal model wave function with a period of 1.86 hours .",
    "we then iterated through a range of amplitude and phase values , and performed a lsf fit to the raw data from the october 2010 epoch .",
    "we chose this set of data because we had contiguous observation nights from october 9 - october 15 2010 ut , as shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "the best solution which fitted the raw data parameters was subtracted out .",
    "lomb - scargle periodogram analysis was run on the remaining data points , which searched for residual periodic signatures .",
    "we observed no obvious evidence in the periodogram of any second significant source .",
    "as a follow - up , we modeled the superposition of two sinusoidal sources by setting a period of 1.86 hours for one source , varying the other period , as well as the amplitude and the phase of both waves , and performed a lsf to our data - as outlined in   [ amp_var ] .",
    "these fits did not yield strong evidence of another source based on the best lsf solutions .",
    "the lack of evidence in the periodograms , as well as the inability to clearly detect an underlying source in the residual data after subtracting the main 1.86 hour period out , does not support the obvious presence of another period .",
    "nevertheless , the varying component of amplitude and phase remains in these data , as shown in figure  [ fig10 ] . in this plot",
    ", we show raw light curves from the october 2010 epoch ( oct 10 - oct 15 ut ) with a model sinusoidal wave overplotted ( in red ) .",
    "the established period of 1.86 hours was used , and corresponding amplitudes from table  [ table_amp_var ] were adopted for each light curve .",
    "we use a fixed phase for all nights . as we observe the model wave for each observation",
    ", we can see that the wave is in phase for some nights ( e.g. oct 11 , oct 13 and oct 15 ) .",
    "by contrast , the signal appears to have moved out of phase for oct 12 .",
    "we can also see , for oct 10 and oct 14 for example , that the model is largely in phase for the first half of each observation ( although upon closer inspection there is some evidence of trailing and leading peaks and troughs ) , but then moves partially _ out of phase _ as the amplitude of the signal increases - we also note changes in light curve morphology for these sections .",
    "this behavior could be characteristic of a high - dynamic environment in these regions , where the source of the variability is evolving on these time scales .",
    "perhaps a magnetic feature is not stationary on the stellar photosphere , or alternatively a combination of features could be effecting light curve morphology .",
    "moreover , if these features were undergoing changes in size or temperature , this could also have an effect on the sinusoidal shape .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of another source - perhaps a more robust modeling technique than those used here is required to identify the presence of another period . obtaining",
    "a contiguous time series of lp 349 - 25 over many periods of rotation , would allow us to more effectively investigate whether these morphological changes are evolving in a systematic and repeatable manner .",
    "the detected rotation period from lp 349 - 25b in this work provides an important parameter in assessing the orbital coplanarity of the system , as well as the associated implications for binary formation theory in the vlm binary regime .",
    "recent work by @xcite has demonstrated spin - orbit alignment for the vlm binary 2 m j0746ab - the first such observational result in this mass range .",
    "their work showed that the spin axes inclinations of both components of the system were aligned to within 10 degrees of the orbital plane .",
    "such an alignment signals that solar - type binary formation mechanisms , such as core fragmentation , disk fragmentation or competitive accretion , may extend into the realm of brown dwarfs .",
    "although the alignment of one system could not be used to distinguish between the various formation theories , investigating such alignments in other vlm systems provides an insight into where the above formation pathways may dominate .",
    "here we applied the same approach as outlined in @xcite to assess the orbital properties lp 349 - 25ab .",
    "we used the evolutionary models of @xcite to estimate the age and mass ( and later the radius ) of each binary component .",
    "these parameters were constrained by adopting the established total system mass of 0.121 @xmath1 0.009 @xmath11 , as well as the photometric _",
    "j _ _ h _ _ k _ measurements and bolometric luminosity measurements of @xcite .",
    "in addition , previous spectroscopic investigations yielded no lithium in the dwarf s spectrum , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we used these parameters to identify a range of ages where lithium was absent , and next interpolated over a range of masses by comparing the correlation between the _ j h k _ colors and bolometric luminosities of @xcite , and those of the @xcite models .",
    "furthermore , by assuming each component was coeval , the sum of the component masses could not exceed the measured total system mass of 0.121 @xmath1 0.009 @xmath11 .",
    "we find an age consistent with @xcite of @xmath0140 myr , with masses of @xmath00.06 @xmath11 and @xmath00.05 @xmath11 for lp 349 - 25a and lp 349 - 25b , respectively .",
    "however , _ lithium is present _ in this range .",
    "@xcite suggested that perhaps the absence of lithium in the binary spectrum was due to flux domination from the primary member , and given the predicted mass of lp 349 - 25b in their work , the li@xmath58 doublet is expected since lp 349 - 25b potentially lies below the theoretically predicted lithium depletion point at @xmath160.055 - 0.065 @xmath11 .",
    "the only ages ( where li=0 ) that are in mild agreement suggest that the system has a total mass that far exceeds 0.121 @xmath1 0.009 @xmath11 .",
    "lithium however may not be a robust indicator of age .",
    "for example , @xcite point out that episodic accretion can cause lithium to be depleted at younger ages , despite its expected presence based on evolutionary models .",
    "another possibility might also be that the total system mass has been under - estimated , which would place lp 349 - 25ab at an older age in the models of @xcite , consequently supporting the observed absence of lithium .",
    "0.02 hours for one or other of the components . we illustrate this by aligning the measured system inclination angle of 61.3 @xmath1 1.5 degrees , i , x - axis bottom ) at 90 degrees to the equatorial axes ( x - axis , @xmath35 , top ) ; as shown by the green vertical line and the associated dashed error lines .",
    "@xcite report equatorial velocities of @xmath062 km s@xmath12 and @xmath095 km s@xmath12 for lp 349 - 25a and b , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the radii estimates of @xcite are overestimated , based on an orthogonally aligned system .",
    "assuming such an alignment , a period of 1.86 @xmath1 0.02 hours is inconsistent with that of lp 349 - 25a , which requires a much smaller radius of @xmath00.96 @xmath13 .",
    "however , a radius of @xmath01.45 @xmath13 is derived here for lp 349 - 25b , which is in loose agreement with the estimates of @xcite , by taking errors in the period and _ v _ sin _ i _ into account .",
    "we therefore have a case to tentatively assign the period of a 1.86 @xmath1 0.02 hours to lp 349 - 25b , as well as possible spin - orbit alignment for this component of the system . ]",
    "1.37 @xmath13 @xcite , in addition to the _ v _ sin _ i _ of 83 @xmath1 3 km s@xmath12 @xcite , and the period of 1.86 @xmath1 0.2 hours in this work , there is tentative evidence that the orientation of the equatorial axis of lp 349 - 25b , @xmath59 , is perpendicularly aligned with the binary orbital plane . ]",
    "@xcite obtained dynamical mass measurements of a sample of late - m dwarfs , including lp 349 - 25ab .",
    "their modeling subsequently yield radii estimates of @xmath01.30 - 1.44 @xmath13 for lp 349 - 25a and @xmath01.24 - 1.37 @xmath13 for lp 349 - 25b .",
    "however , @xcite find much larger radii estimates of 1.7@xmath60 @xmath13 ( a ) and 1.68@xmath61 @xmath13 ( b ) .",
    "these studies based their radii on evolutionary model - derived parameters @xcite . under the assumption of a perfectly coplanar spin - orbit alignment , by adopting the individual rotational velocity measurements of @xcite and by assigning the detected period in this work of 1.86 @xmath1 0.02 hours to each component , we derive radii of @xmath00.96 @xmath13 for lp 349 - 25a , and @xmath01.45 @xmath13 for lp 349 - 25b .",
    "we show these in figure  [ fig11 ] by the dash - dotted horizontal lines , where we have plotted the system s equatorial velocity vs. inclination angle ( refer to caption ) .    considering the radii estimates of @xcite , as well as an orbital inclination angle of 61.3 @xmath1 1.5 degrees from their work ,",
    "we derive a maximum period of rotation of @xmath03.77 hours and @xmath02.47 hours for lp 349 - 25a and lp 349 - 25b , respectively . indeed , these radii estimates appear to be very large when considering the evolutionary models of @xcite for a given range of ages , @xmath62 , and total system mass presented in their work , in addition to a lack of detected lithium in the binary spectra @xcite",
    ". therefore , it is difficult to infer which component matches our detected period .",
    "as previously noted , the @xcite binary radii instead infer maximum periods of @xmath02.65 hours and @xmath01.67 hours respectively",
    ". this discrepancy could be due to the fact that @xcite use only broadband photometry , and furthermore use the effective temperature as one of the inputs for model - predicted mass , whereas @xcite obtain their temperature estimates via nir fitting , which is @xmath0650 k higher .",
    "notably , determining an accurate estimate of the radius of young , magnetically active stars can be very difficult based on the effect of a reduction in convective efficiency of such objects ( @xmath50.35 @xmath11 ) , see @xcite . since the adiabatic properties of a star increase with mass , such an environment reduces convection in the outer areas .",
    "the end result is a reduction in stellar luminosity and core temperature , causing the radius to expand .",
    "nevertheless , a radius estimate of @xmath01.45 @xmath13 for lp 349 - 25b ( derived above ) is in lose agreement with the estimates of @xcite , and therefore we highlight a tentative spin - orbit alignment for the secondary star - as shown by the sketch in figure  [ fig12 ] . establishing the period of rotation of the other binary component will enable a more effective constraint of the orbital properties . finally , as in the case of 2 m",
    "j0746ab , the inclinations of the spin axes with respect to our line of sight may be equal , but this does not always imply that the orbital planes are perpendicularly aligned",
    ". even if edge - on systems are orthogonal to the sky , they could be coincidentally equal .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion of the various formation mechanisms , and the implications for formation theory in the vlm binary regime .",
    "we have reported on optical photometric observations of six ultracool dwarfs spanning the @xmath0m8 - l3.5 spectral range . our work has confirmed periodic optical variability for five out of six of the radio active dwarf sample , where periodicity for two of these was discovered for the first time .",
    "we report a tentative detection of periodic variability for another dwarf - sampling the rotational phase of this object will establish whether periodic variability is also present . based on previous surveys that have yielded a low fraction of periodic variability for late - m and l dwarfs , our results indicate a likely correlation between the optical and radio periodic variability .",
    "this correlation implies that the optical and radio periodic emissions may be related by some kind of magnetic phenomena ; however at this point it is not clear whether such a possible connection is causal in nature .    for one of our targets in particular , the pulsing m9 ultracool dwarf tvlm 513",
    ", we find periodic variability that is extremely stable in phase over baselines of @xmath05 years .",
    "we achieved an accurate enough rotation period of 1.95958 @xmath1 0.00005 hours that allowed us to phase connect the @xmath05 year baseline .",
    "the high level of phase stability indicates that the stellar feature responsible for the periodic variability is not moving over these time scales .",
    "we do however observe large changes in the peak to peak amplitude variability , pointing toward changes in the size or intensity of the source regions , responsible for the periodicity .",
    "similarly , for the m tight binary dwarf lp 349 - 25 , the peak to peak amplitude variations change significantly during observations .",
    "the phase also changes on these time scales , where we observe it to move in and out of phase during single nights .",
    "a number of scenarios are considered for this behavior - e.g. the presence of two periodically varying sources .",
    "these changes in morphology could also be a consequence of a high - dynamic environment in these regions , where features are changing in size , temperature and shape , and/or are moving with respect to the stellar photosphere .    finally",
    ", we assess the spin - orbit alignment of lp 349 - 25 , based on the discovery of the rotation period for one component in this work . by adopting the radii estimates of @xcite , and assigning the period of rotation of 1.86 hours discovered here for lp 349 - 25b , we find evidence for a tentative alignment of the spin - orbital axes .",
    "such an alignment has been observed for another vlm binary dwarf - 2 m j0746ab @xcite . establishing the second period of rotation for the system would further constrain its orbital properties , and further",
    "provide insight into the possible formation mechanisms responsible for such alignments in the vlm binary regime .",

    "<S> a fraction of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs are known to be radio active , in some cases producing periodic pulses . </S>",
    "<S> extensive studies of two such objects have also revealed optical periodic variability and the nature of this variability remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> here we report on multi - epoch optical photometric monitoring of six radio detected dwarfs , spanning the @xmath0m8 - l3.5 spectral range , conducted to investigate the ubiquity of periodic optical variability in radio detected ultracool dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this survey is the most sensitive ground - based study carried out to date in search of periodic optical variability from late - type dwarfs , where we obtained 250 hours of monitoring , delivering photometric precision as low as @xmath00.15% . </S>",
    "<S> five of the six targets exhibit clear periodicity , in all cases likely associated with the rotation period of the dwarf , with a marginal detection found for the sixth . </S>",
    "<S> our data points to a likely association between radio and optical periodic variability in late - m / early - l dwarfs , although the underlying physical cause of this correlation remains unclear . in one case </S>",
    "<S> , we have multiple epochs of monitoring of the archetype of pulsing radio dwarfs , the m9 tvlm 513 - 46546 , spanning a period of 5 years , which is sufficiently stable in phase to allow us to establish a period of 1.95958 @xmath1 0.00005 hours . </S>",
    "<S> this phase stability may be associated with a large - scale stable magnetic field , further strengthening the correlation between radio activity and periodic optical variability . </S>",
