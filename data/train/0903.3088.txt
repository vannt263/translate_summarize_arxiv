    "the current observations , such as sneia ( supernovae type ia ) , cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) and large scale structure , converge on the fact that a spatially homogeneous and gravitationally repulsive energy component , referred as dark energy , accounts for about @xmath0 % of the energy density of universe .",
    "some heuristic models that roughly describe the observable consequences of dark energy were proposed in recent years , a number of them stemming from a certain physics @xcite and the others being purely phenomenological @xcite .",
    "about thirty years ago , the bouncing cosmological model with torsion was suggested in ref.@xcite , but the torsion was imagined as playing role only at high densities in the early universe .",
    "goenner et al . made a general survey of the torsion cosmology @xcite , in which the equations for all the pgt ( poincar gauge theory of gravity ) cases were discussed although they only solved in detail a few particular cases .",
    "recently some authors have begun to study torsion as a possible reason of the accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "nester and collaborators @xcite consider an accounting for the accelerated universe in term of pgt : dynamic scalar torsion . with the usual assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy in cosmology",
    ", they find that torsion field could play a role of dark energy .",
    "this elegant model has only a few adjustable parameters , so scalar torsion may be easily falsified as `` dark energy '' .",
    "the fine - tuning problem should be one of the most important issues for the cosmological models , and a good model should limit the fine - tuning as much as possible .",
    "the dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the late - time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field and thus alleviates the fine - tuning problem @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study attractor and heteroclinic orbit in the torsion cosmology .",
    "we show that the late - time de sitter behaviors cover a wide range of the parameters .",
    "this attractor indicates that torsion cosmology is an elegant scheme and the scalar torsion mode is an interesting geometric quantity for physics .",
    "furthermore , there are only exact periodic solutions for the linearized system , which just correspond to the critical line ( line of centers ) .",
    "the numerical solutions in ref.@xcite are not periodic , but are quasi - periodic solutions near the focus for the coupled nonlinear equations .",
    "pgt @xcite based on a riemann - cartan geometry , allows for dynamic torsion in addition to curvature .",
    "the affine connection of the riemann - cartan geometry is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the levi - civita connection and @xmath3 is the torsion tensor .",
    "meanwhile , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature , respectively , and @xmath7 is the covariant derivative with the levi - civita connection and @xmath8 . according as ref.@xcite we take the restricted form of torsion in this paper @xmath9\\rho }    \\label{restrictedt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the gravitational lagrangian density for the scalar mode is ( for a detailed discussion see ref.@xcite ) @xmath10 since current observations favor a flat universe , we will work in the spatially flat robertson - walker metric .",
    "according to the homogeneity and isotropy , the torsion @xmath11 should be only time dependent , so one can let @xmath12 and the spatial parts vanish since we have taken the restricted form ( [ restrictedt ] ) of torsion . for the general form ,",
    "the torsion tensor have two independent components @xcite-@xcite . from the field equations",
    "one can finally give the necessary equations for the matter - dominated era to integrate ( for a detailed discussion see ref.@xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 and the energy density of matter component @xmath15 one can scale the variables and the parameters as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the present value of hubble parameter and @xmath18 is the planck length .",
    "under the transform ( [ scale ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) remain unchanged .",
    "after transform , new variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and new parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are all dimensionless . furthermore , the newtonian limit requires @xmath27 .",
    "obviously , eqs .",
    "( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) is an autonomous system , so we can use the qualitative method of ordinary differential equations .",
    "it is worth noting that in the analysis of critical points , copeland et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the elegant compact variables which are defined from the friedmann equation constraint , but in our case , the friedmann equation can not be written as the ordinary form , so the compact variables are not convenient here .",
    "therefore , we will analyze the system of eqs.([dth])-([dtr ] ) using the variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 under the transform ( [ scale ] ) .",
    "in the case of scalar torsion mode , the effective energy - momentum tensor can be represented as @xmath28\\,,\\label{torpre}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the off - diagonal terms vanish .",
    "the effective energy density @xmath29 which is deduced from general relativity .",
    "@xmath30 is an effective pressure , and the effective equation of state is @xmath31 which is induced by the dynamic torsion .    according to equations ( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) ,",
    "we can obtain the critical points and study the stability of these points .",
    "there are five critical points @xmath32 of the system as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "consider that the parameter @xmath26 is associated with the quadratic scalar curvature term @xmath37 , so that @xmath26 should be positive @xcite .",
    "evidently , the critical points @xmath32 are not real values except ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) in the cases of parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "if we consider the linearized equations , then eqs .",

    ", there is no periodic solution for the nonlinear system since the corresponding eigenvalue is ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) . in fig.[focusa1g0 ] , we plot the orbits near the point @xmath42 for the nonlinear systems .     for nonlinear system ( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) with @xmath53 .",
