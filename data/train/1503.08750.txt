    "magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons ( zgnr ) is related to edge - localized states , which appear as two flat bands at the fermi energy ( @xmath0 ) in a simple noninteracting model .",
    "in fact , the electron interaction splits these bands , so the edges are antiferromagnetically coupled with total spin zero @xcite .",
    "this magnetic behavior is rather general , because similar localized bands are also present in any non - armchair graphene ribbon @xcite .",
    "when the edges of the nanoribbon are identical , all the bands remain spin - degenerate . for dissimilar edges with sublattice balance",
    ", the spin splitting may be different for each edge @xcite , but the ribbons have total spin zero . in order to exploit spin effects in zgnrs for applications ,",
    "spin degeneracy should be lifted , so uncompensated spin channels are obtained .",
    "such splitting can be achieved under a strong external electric field @xcite or by chemical attack @xcite .    in general , one way to attain ferromagnetic graphene nanostructures",
    "is to impose sublattice imbalance . according to lieb s theorem",
    ", a bipartite lattice has a total spin moment proportional to the difference of the number of atoms belonging to the two sublattices @xcite .",
    "for instance , zgnrs with one decorated edge of klein - type atoms @xcite , triangular graphene nanoislands @xcite , and graphene systems with vacancies that remove a different number of nodes from each sublattice @xcite have a non - zero spin due to the imbalance . in this work",
    "we show another way of producing a net magnetic moment in zigzag graphene nanoribbons by including reconstructed divacancies .",
    "we consider divacancies produced by the removal of two neighbor carbon atoms , so that the two sublattices are balanced .",
    "they rebuild into the so - called 5 - 8 - 5 defects , composed of an octagon and a pair of pentagons which mix the two sublattices .",
    "divacancies may naturally appear as stable defects during growth or can be created on purpose by electron or ion irradiation @xcite .",
    "they are the source of defect - localized states with energies close to @xmath0 , as it was recently shown for the case of semiconducting armchair ribbons @xcite .",
    "since divacancies do not introduce sublattice imbalance , they have not been regarded to this date as possible sources of magnetization in graphene .",
    "however , we show here that when these defects are present in zigzag nanoribbons , they give rise to localized states which may interact with those originated from the zigzag edges , so they can lead to spin effects and ribbon magnetization . two previous calculations for 5 - 8 - 5 defects in zgnrs presented results in apparent contradiction , showing either zero spin polarization @xcite , or spin - polarized transport in ribbons with narrow widths @xcite .",
    "the issue of whether these defective nanoribbons are ferromagnetic or not was not addressed in those works . in principle , one could interpret that spin polarization arose in narrow ribbons because of size effects .    in order to clarify this point , in this work",
    "we perform a systematic study of the magnetic behavior of zgnrs with reconstructed divacancies .",
    "we have found that , although these divacancies arise from lattice - balanced defects , can nevertheless produce a net magnetic moment in zigzag nanoribbons .",
    "this happens when they are located close to the zigzag ribbon edge .",

    "we show that when defects are centrally located in wide zgnrs , the ribbons have zero net magnetic moment",
    ". however , when they are placed close to one of the zigzag edges , the defect - localized and the nearby edge bands interact , so they mix and split in energy .",
    "the zero energy band corresponding to the other edge situated farther from the defect remains unmixed .",
    "the inclusion of electron - electron interaction results in the spin splitting of all these bands . the aforementioned unmixed band is symmetrically split around @xmath0 , while the hybridized defect - edge bands are asymmetrically split , yielding a non - zero net magnetization .",
    "we propose that the production of reconstructed divacancies by techniques such as ion bombardment may produce magnetic ribbons .",
    "as the one of the most abundant defects in zgnrs are divacancies @xcite , which are preferentially found at the edges @xcite , this defect engineering could be a feasible way to produce spin - polarized zgnrs .",

    ", the defect band hybridizes with two edge bands , giving three bands away from @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( a ) .",
    "the defect does not mix with the remaining upper edge band ( green ) , because it stems from the states close to @xmath24 of the unfolded edge band of the zgnr ( 1,0 ) : as it is mostly localized at the edge atoms , it has a small overlap with the defect .",
    "likewise , the lower edge discrete states ( blue ) are also unaffected by the divacancy due to the spatial separation .",
    "these unchanged states are spin - split as for a pure zgnr .",
    "however , the spin splitting of the hybridized states ( red ) is much weaker , with a state below @xmath0 occupied for both spin polarizations . for even larger @xmath2 ,",
    "the spins of the extra occupied upper edge states far from the defect cancel with the spins of the occupied lower edge states .",
    "thus , an isolated straight divacancy in an infinite zgnr has a total spin polarization equal to @xmath25 @xmath16 .",
    "we have also checked that tilted vacancies have a similar behavior , although the total magnetic moments tend to be reduced .",
    "this divacancy - induced magnetism at the edge of zigzag ribbons is now brought into contact with experiments .",
    "we propose that ion irradiation of zigzag ribbons could be employed to create divacancies .",
    "this technique is used nowadays to produce vacancies in graphene @xcite .",
    "in fact , vacancies are mobile and cluster in the form of divacancies @xcite .",
    "note that for nanoribbons , it is more energetically favorable for these vacancies to move close to the edge because of its lower coordination , where they can coalesce in the more stable and abundant divacancies @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of zgnrs with reconstructed divacancies , which can be viewed as the removal of two neighbor carbon atoms from different sublattices before reconstruction to 5 - 8 - 5 defects .",
    "although 5 - 8 - 5 defects stem from lattice - balanced vacancies , they can give rise to a net spin magnetic moment .",
    "we have shown that a nonzero magnetization arises when the defect is located close to the edges of the zigzag ribbon .",
    "the 5 - 8 - 5 defects introduce localized states with energies close to @xmath0 .",
    "when they are located at the center of the ribbon , the total spin polarization is zero , keeping the magnetic edge configuration of pristine ribbons .",
    "however , when the defects are placed closer to one of the edges of the ribbon , the defect band interacts with the edge - localized band , so they hybridize and split asymmetrically from @xmath0 .",
    "states localized at the other edge remain strongly spin - split , leading to a net spin polarization and spontaneous magnetization of the ribbon , despite they are derived from systems with balanced sublattices before reconstruction .",
    "the total magnetic moment saturates for large periods to a value of 2 @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we have also clarified the apparent contradiction between previous works , namely , the absence of spin polarization shown for some defective ribbons , in contrast with the obtention of spin - polarized currents in similar systems @xcite . in narrow ribbons , divacancies are naturally close to edges , so a spin - polarized current may arise . in wider ribbons , divacancies situated at the central region of the ribbon do not produce such spin polarization .",
