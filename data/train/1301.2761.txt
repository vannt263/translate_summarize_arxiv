    "quark - gluon matter initially produced in au - au collisions at rhic energies is not in a thermal state and has not a temperature since gluon and quark distributions are anisotropic in momentum space . after a period of time of @xmath0 ,",
    "quark - gluon matter is in a thermal state and has a temperature while the distributions are isotropic , i.e. quark - gluon matter is a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the transition from initially produced quark - gluon matter to the quark - gluon plasma is a thermalization process and @xmath0 is the thermalization time . it had not been expected that the thermalization time is small before the measured elliptic flow coefficient of hadrons was first reported . in order to explain the measured data , hydrodynamic calculations assume early thermalization and ideal relativistic fluid flow @xcite .",
    "early thermalization is that a thermal state is achieved with a time less than 1 fm/@xmath1 from the moment when quark - gluon matter is initially created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "different thermalization times have been given in different hydrodynamic models @xcite .",
    "strongly interacting matter in thermal equilibrium can very easily flow in any direction without any breakup , i.e. this matter is a perfect liquid .",
    "strong interaction of particles inside dense matter establishes a thermal state rapidly .",
    "this means that the quark - gluon plasma formed by the early thermalization is a perfect liquid .",
    "therefore , the early thermalization is crucial to the perfect liquid the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the early thermalization is an assumption in hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "we need to understand the early thermalization .",
    "then , two questions are raised .",
    "one is how initially produced quark - gluon matter establishes a thermal state , another is when initially produced quark - gluon matter establishes a thermal state . to answer the two questions",
    ", we examine the occurrence probabilities of two - parton scattering , three - parton scattering and so on in quark - gluon matter .",
    "this is motivated by the thought that thermalization is related to two - body scattering @xcite .",
    "one thousand and five hundred partons are generated from hijing within @xmath2 fm in the longitudinal direction and @xmath3 fm in the transverse direction in central au - au collisions at @xmath4 gev .",
    "this volume of partons corresponds to a parton number density of 19.4 @xmath5 .",
    "the maxima of the numbers of @xmath6-parton scattering with @xmath7 are 750 , 500 , 375 , 300 , 250 and 214 , respectively .",
    "the occurrence probability can be represented by the number of @xmath6-parton scattering divided by the sum of the maximum numbers of two- , three- , @xmath8 , and seven - parton scattering .",
    "the occurrence probability increases with increasing interaction range . at an interaction range of 0.62 fm",
    "the 2-parton scattering and 3-parton scattering have occurrence probabilities of 0.3 and 0.2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the three - parton scattering is important due to the high parton number density .",
    "one effect of elastic three - gluon scattering is the early thermalization of gluon matter initially produced in central au - au collisions @xcite .",
    "the early thermalization is an effect of many - body interaction !",
    "thermalization of quark - gluon matter at a high number density is governed by the two - parton scattering and the three - parton scattering .",
    "this is the answer to the first question .",
    "an answer to the second question is given in the next two sections .",
    "thermalization of water ( air ) is governed by elastic two - body scattering of water molecules ( air molecules ) .",
    "thermalization by elastic two - body scattering is conventional .",
    "therefore , two - parton scattering is first taken into account to examine thermalization of quark - gluon matter .",
    "elastic parton - parton scattering was studied by cutler and sivers in @xcite and by combridge , kripfganz and ranft in @xcite in perturbative qcd .",
    "spin- and color - averaged squared amplitudes of order @xmath9 were derived by hand and expressions for the squared amplitudes are presented in terms of the mandelstam variables in @xcite .",
    "it is very convenient to use the expressions .",
    "however , it is impractical to derive squared amplitudes for elastic parton - parton - parton scattering by hand and the squared amplitudes have to be derived from fortran code .",
    "this is because many feynman diagrams even at order @xmath10 are involved in the elastic 3-to-3 scattering .",
    "for example , there are 72 diagrams for elastic scattering of one gluon and two identical quarks and 76 diagrams for elastic gluon - quark - antiquark scattering @xcite .",
    "only one feynman diagram has two four - gluon vertices and it is shown in figure 1 .",
    "scattering of three gluons .",
    "the wiggly lines stand for gluons . ]",
    "the squared amplitude for the diagram takes the shortest expression among all diagrams involved in elastic parton - parton - parton scattering at the tree level . including the average over the spin and color states of the three initial gluons , the spin- and color - summed squared amplitude is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the square of the sum of the four - momenta of the three initial gluons .",
    "the expression has only one term , but the squared amplitudes for other diagrams have more terms with the reasons as follows .",
    "the other diagrams must have at least one triple - gluon vertex or the trace of a product of dirac matrices . according to the feynman rules",
    "the triple - gluon vertex consists of three terms .",
    "the trace of a product of even four dirac matrices gives three terms .",
    "then , the squared amplitude for each of the other feynman diagrams or any interference term of different diagrams must have at least three terms .    according to the numbers of the triple - gluon vertex and the four - gluon vertex , feynman diagrams are classified and their squared amplitudes are organized .",
    "for instance , the 72 diagrams for elastic gluon - quark - quark scattering are separated into 3 classes @xcite .",
    "the first , second and third classes contain 40 diagrams with no triple - gluon vertex and no four - gluon vertex , 24 diagrams with one triple - gluon vertex and no four - gluon vertex and 8 diagrams with two triple - gluon vertices or one four - gluon vertex , respectively .",
    "the 76 diagrams for elastic gluon - quark - antiquark scattering are also divided into 3 classes even though quark - antiquark annihilation may occur @xcite .",
    "the first class contains 40 diagrams with no triple - gluon vertex and no four - gluon vertex : 20 diagrams with no quark - antiquark annihilation and 20 diagrams with the annihilation .",
    "the second class contains 28 diagrams with one triple - gluon vertex and no four - gluon vertex : 12 with no quark - antiquark annihilation and 16 with the annihilation .",
    "the third class contains 8 diagrams with two triple - gluon vertices or one four - gluon vertex : 4 with no quark - antiquark annihilation and 4 with the annihilation .",
    "we establish transport equations for quark - gluon matter which consists of gluons , quarks and antiquarks with up and down flavors .",
    "we assume that the quark distribution is symmetric in flavor and is identical with the antiquark distribution .",
    "the quark and gluon distribution functions are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , where @xmath15 labels the @xmath15th quark or gluon . with the elastic parton - parton scattering and the elastic parton - parton - parton scattering ,",
    "the transport equation for gluons is @xcite @xmath16   \\right .",
