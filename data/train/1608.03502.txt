    "the origin of the fundamental plane ,  the relation : @xmath8 between the effective surface brightness , the effective radius and the central velocity dispersion of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , is still unclear since the epoch of its discovery @xcite .",
    "the problem consists in the observation that the fp coefficients deviate significantly from the virial expectation for homologous galaxies and in the fact that the scatter around the plane is very small along the whole fp extension .",
    "the first interpretation of the tilt was related to the behaviour of the stellar populations of galaxies through their stellar mass - to - light ratio which was seen to vary with luminosity ( @xmath9 , with @xmath10 @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent , independent measurements found similar values of @xmath11 ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an alternative explanation was that galaxies are progressively non homologous systems along the fp @xcite .",
    "this scenario was supported by the observation that the light profiles and dynamics of etgs deviate systematically from homology @xcite .",
    "@xcite however pointed out that a strong fine  tuning between stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath12 ) and structure ( sersic index @xmath13 ) is required to explain with just structural non - homology both the tilt of the fp and the small scatter around it ( the so - called @xmath14 conspiracy ) .",
    "@xcite also excluded an important contribution of non - homology to the tilt using integral models of the etgs mass distribution based on 2d kinematic maps .",
    "along the same vein , the galaxy mass distribution estimated from gravitational lensing by @xcite did not seem to support an important role for non - homology .",
    "subsequent interpretations of the tilt proposed a number of possible mechanisms : metallicity effects @xcite , dark matter distribution and amount ( dm ) @xcite , dissipation effects during galaxy collapse ( see   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , variable initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , star formation history ( sfh ) , etc . , but the contribution of dm and imf was also excluded by @xcite on the basis of a required strong fine - tuning argument , and observing that the observed sfh of galaxies is hardly reconciled with the widely accepted hierarchical paradigm of the @xmath15cdm cosmology .",
    "more recently @xcite proposed the existence of a fine - tuning mechanism able to explain the properties of the fp based on the observed mutual correlation between galaxy mass , mass - to - light ratio and sersic index .",
    "in addition to the tilt the small observed scatter ( @xmath16 ) around the fp is also unexplained . @xcite and @xcite found a correlation between the residuals of the fp and the age of the galaxies ( etgs with higher / lower surface brightness have younger / older ages ) .",
    "@xcite claimed that the fp residuals anti - correlate with the mean stellar age , while a strong correlation exists with @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "@xcite proposed that the stellar population variations contribute at most 50% of the total thickness and that correlated variations in the imf or in the central dm fraction make up the rest .",
    "@xcite found that the residuals about the fp show significant trends with environment , morphology and stellar population , with the strongest trend being with age .",
    "the above discussion clearly reveals that a general consensus about the origin of the fp and its properties is still lacking .",
    "we remember that even the distribution of galaxies in the  plane ,  one of the projections of the fp , is poorly understood .",
    "@xcite showed that etgs do not follow the distribution expected for galaxies of the same total luminosity , but are tilted with respect to this line , while @xcite and @xcite noted that in this plane galaxies seem to avoid a region of space : the so called zone of exclusion ( zoe ) .",
    "they claimed that the slope of the zoe and the progressive displacement of the hubble types from this line is consistent with the hierarchical clustering scenario with a @xmath18 power - law density fluctuation spectrum ( plus dissipation ) .",
    "the same considerations can be done for the faber - jackson relation connecting galaxy luminosity with velocity dispersion ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose slope ( and zero point ) changed progressively ( today the measured slope is @xmath20 ) .",
    "this relation is considered a projection of the fp and as such was also related to the virial theorem , but alternative explanations are possible .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new possible solution for the origin of the fp and fj relations able to explain all their observational properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section we present the main equations and assumptions that define the fp problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe our proposed solution and in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we provide the observational evidences in favor of our hypothesis . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we discuss the origin of the fj relation and in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] the consequences of our solution for the problem of the star formation activity in galaxies across the cosmic history . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume that etgs are gravitationally bound stellar systems which satisfy the virial theorem equation :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the total galaxy mass , @xmath23 a suitable mean radius , and @xmath24 a mean kinetic energy per unit mass . by definition",
    "every kind of virialized system must belong to the virial plane ( vp ) in the space defined by the variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately , these are not observable quantities .",
    "therefore , in the case of etgs , the virial eq .",
    "( [ eqvir ] ) is usually written as follows :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 takes into account projection effects , density distribution and stellar orbits distribution .",
    "the term @xmath27 parameterizes our ignorance about the orientation , 3d structure and dynamics of etgs .",
    "the formal expression of @xmath27 ( which is a dimensionless quantity ) assumes : @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "introducing the mean effective surface brightness @xmath30 , one gets such expression for the virial plane ( vp ) :    @xmath31    or , in logarithmic form :    @xmath32    this formulation of the virial theorem is directly comparable with the fp of eq .",
    "( [ eq1fp ] ) rewritten with @xmath33 as independent variable as empirically derived from observations",
    ".    note that for a given mass @xmath22 and zero point do exist infinite values of which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eqvirlog ] ) : all the points belonging to a plane obey such equation .",
    "this led to the definition of vp : _ the vp is the locus of points defined by the values of  which reproduce a constant mass @xmath22 for an assigned zero point .",
    "_ in other words the virial theorem does not provide any constraints on the position of a galaxy in the .",
    "two galaxies with the same mass and zero point , but with a different combination of @xmath34 and @xmath27 , may share the same vp . in general eq .",
    "( [ eqvirlog ] ) defines a family of planes filling the  space for all galaxies .    the zero point of eq .",
    "( [ eqvirlog ] ) is given by the quantity : @xmath35 so that each galaxy has its own zero point characterized by a peculiar @xmath34 ( dark matter and stellar content ) and @xmath27 ( degree of non - homology ) .",
    "if etgs were perfectly homologous systems with similar @xmath34 the @xmath36 would be a constant .    in the  space",
    "each vp is parallel to the others .",
    "this way of connecting the fp with the vp clearly links the tilt of the plane to the properties of the stellar population , the dark matter content and the galaxy structure and dynamics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that all the proposed solutions have tried to demonstrate the link of the zero point with these galaxy properties .",
    "the existence of the fp requires a connection between @xmath27 ( structure ) and @xmath34 ( dm and stellar populations ) .",
    "the new proposed solution comes from the observation that a galaxy of a given mass @xmath22 has not a defined position in the  space .",
    "its virial equilibrium is guaranteed by all possible combination of the variables that fit the virial equation .",
    "it would be nice to have at least another constraint to better define the location of a galaxy in the  space .    in order to find such constraint we consider that a galaxy of a given mass @xmath22 has also a total luminosity @xmath37 .",
    "the luminosity of a galaxy depends on the luminosities of its stars , and these latter in turn depend on the star radius and the effective temperature that each star reaches at its surface .",
    "the common way of introducing the luminosity in the fp problem was through the mass - to - light ratio , but we note that luminosity is independent on the virial equilibrium , being eventually the product of the sf history of galaxies .",
    "the question therefore is : could luminosity alone be expressed in terms of the variables of the  space ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "consider in fact that the total luminosity @xmath37 is observed to correlate with the velocity dispersion @xmath38 of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this relation has been considered a consequence of the virial theorem , but we will see below that its origin could be indeed quite different .    for the moment we assume that for each galaxy is valid the following equation : @xmath39 where @xmath2 and @xmath40 are the unknown zero point ( @xmath41 ) and slope of a relation valid for each individual galaxy .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eqbb ] ) is not the fj relation that is valid for the population of etgs .    remembering that @xmath42 and passing to the logarithms we obtain : @xmath43    this is again a plane in the  space , but this time the plane is tilted with respect to the fp .",
    "we will call this plane the `` bb plane '' for a reason that will be clear later .",
    "we therefore define the bb plane , as follows : _ the bb plane is the locus of points defined by the values of , which reproduce a constant luminosity @xmath37 for an assigned zero point @xmath2 .",
    "_ this plane contains , as the vp , only one galaxy and all bb planes are parallel each other in the  space .",
    "the different inclination of the vp and bb planes suggests that they intersect somewhere in the  space , forming a line in such space . along this line",
    "it resides only one object , that with mass @xmath22 , luminosity @xmath37 and zero points @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in other words along this line , the product @xmath46 is constant .",
    "it is clear that if the zero points of the vp and bb planes vary in a coordinated way , the result will be that of forming several parallel lines in the  space , each one containing one galaxy .",
    "the plane best fitting this distribution of parallel lines is the plane of real galaxies in the  space ,  the fp .",
    "we therefore define the fp as follows : _ the fp is the plane in the  space that best fit all the parallel lines formed by the intersections of the vp and bb planes . in this plane",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is approximately constant . _ in this framework , the existence of a fp for real galaxies implies that a connection must exist between @xmath47 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 .",
    "a graphical representation of the mechanism originating the fp is given in fig.[fig1 ] .     and",
    "@xmath48 and luminosities @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively are shown with black ( vp ) and red lines ( bb ) .",
    "the fp results in this case from the connection of the two intersections of the vp and bb planes . for many galaxies",
    "the fp is the plane best fitting all the intersecting lines.,width=377 ]    the fp plane is therefore naturally tilted with respect to the vp and bb planes . in this framework the origin of the fp tilt is connected to the simultaneous variation of the zero points of the vp and bb planes ( @xmath44 and @xmath41 ) , and the small scatter observed around the plane is due to the fine - tuning effect linking @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 .",
    "what can we say observationally ?",
    "could we demonstrate the existence of the link between the two planes originating the fp tilt ?",
    "we will see here that this is the case .    from the observational point of view",
    "it is better to look at the projections of the fp , at the  plane , the @xmath51 plane and the @xmath52 plane .",
    "the question is : where are the projections of the intersecting lines ,  the lines of constant @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 in these planes ?    in order to answer such question we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ eq1fp ] ) , ( [ eqvirlog ] ) and ( [ eqbb4 ] ) in the following way : @xmath53 where the coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are related to those of eq .",
    "( [ eq1fp ] ) .",
    "then we take the difference fp - vp and fp - bb .",
    "these differences must be equal on the intersecting lines .",
    "it follows after some algebra that :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 contains all terms not explicitly written in the eq .",
    "( [ eqsys1 ] ) . in view of the future use",
    "it is mathematically convenient to assume :    @xmath59}{[\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{\\beta}]}. \\label{eqzp}\\ ] ]    which also defines the constant @xmath60 .",
    "we have obtained an equation for the  relation .",
    "the zero point of this relation varies as @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 vary in the fp space .",
    "note that the slope of the relation depends only on the value of @xmath40 ,  on the exponent of the bb plane .     as indicated .",
    "the solid lines give the locus of constant galaxy luminosity .",
    "the dotted lines mark the locus of constant @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 ,  the projections of the fp.,width=377 ]    fig.[fig2 ] shows the  plane . here",
    "we adopt a solution for eq .",
    "( [ eqzp ] ) with a value of @xmath1 .",
    "note how this value of @xmath40 naturally reproduce the so called zoe , which appears in this context as a natural limit in the possible values of @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 that a galaxy might have today .",
    "this choice for @xmath40 will be clear below .    in the figure we plotted with different colors different ranges for the stellar @xmath12 ratios available for the galaxies of the wings database in the v - band @xcite .",
    "note that despite the scatter due to measurement errors , the lower mass - to - light ratios appear closer to the zoe",
    ". if this interpretation is correct , objects in virial equilibrium having similar stellar mass - to - light ratio should approximately reside along lines parallel to the zoe .",
    "( @xmath61).,width=377 ]    fig.[fig3 ] is a plot of the  distribution for objects of very different masses , covering a range from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "note that the position of stars in this diagram is almost consistent with the idea of a single linear distribution for objects with the same @xmath34 ratio .",
    "this ratio increases going from the main sequence stars of a spectral type to that of m type stars .",
    "it is apparent that according to the dominating stellar population inside a stellar system we observe different mass - to - light ratios .",
    "note that in this diagram done for the v - band there is a natural selection effect working on , since the lower @xmath47 due to bright stars , who dominate the galaxy luminosity , progressively move the galaxies toward the zoe .",
    "galaxy clusters appear indeed shifted with respect to the selected slope , but we know that these systems contains several spiral galaxies and a lot of dm .",
    "globular clusters on the other hand seem to have the same solar mass - to - light ratio because their stellar population is dominated by stars with high @xmath47 .    if we now write the vp , fj and fp equations using @xmath33 and @xmath64 as independent variables we obtain : @xmath65 where the constant zero points also depend on the combination of @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 .",
    "again the @xmath40 value determines the zoe of the respective diagrams ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .        in conclusion",
    ", we have obtained the fp from the combination of two virtual planes who represent two different law of physics : the virial theorem and the @xmath66 relation .",
    "we have seen that a value of @xmath1 can explain the observed zoe in the @xmath67 plane . in the next section",
    "we will demonstrate the origin of the connections between luminosity and velocity dispersion . why these variables are correlated ?",
    "we now comes to the description of the fj @xmath5 plane , which is very different from the vp .",
    "the fj plane contains two measured quantities , the galaxy luminosity and the stellar velocity dispersion . at variance with the vp that is defined for one galaxy only assigning its mass and zero point",
    ", the fj plane contains all real galaxies at the same time . along the fitted relation",
    "the zero point @xmath7 is nearly constant for all galaxies .",
    "this is not therefore the plane we want for the  space . in this 3d space",
    "we must have a single plane for each galaxy as the locus of points of all possible values of  that provide a given luminosity for an assigned zero point .",
    "this explains why we have used the relation @xmath68 with a free @xmath40 exponent instead that the measured value for the fj relation .    .",
    "now its slope is @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting observed relation valid for all galaxies has slope @xmath70.,width=453 ]    the first thing to note here is that in the fj plane the points of constant @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 are the galaxies themselves ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "note how the selected solution with @xmath1 used for the  relation provides here the correct series of parallel zero points and luminosities for each object that finally reproduce the observed fj relation .",
    "the fj relation originates from the combination of all these parallel virtual planes that represent each single galaxy .    the dashed lines in fig.[fig5 ]",
    "mark the possible positions of the vp planes for galaxies with a given @xmath71 and a fixed .",
    "the intersections of the @xmath72 lines with the vp fix the exact positions of galaxies in the @xmath5 space .",
    "this relation is that expected for virialized stellar systems . in this context",
    "it is possible to explain why the residuals from the fj relation correlate with the @xmath47 ratio @xcite and with galaxy sizes @xcite .",
    "note also that dwarf galaxies deviate from the main galaxy relation .",
    "this occurs for the same reason why these stellar systems deviate from the fp ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) : they have a zero point systematically different ,  different @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath2 values .",
    "the left and right panels of this figure clearly show that all stellar system obey to the fp and fj relations , but with zero points slightly different from that of typical galaxies .",
    "these variations are responsible of the larger exponent observed in many cases for the fj relation ( 4 instead of 2 ) , which ultimately depends on the heterogeneity of the galaxy sample . as seen in the right panel of fig.[fig6 ] a bigger slope for the fj can be easily obtained when etgs ( or spirals ) of very different masses ( and different zero - points ) are plotted together .",
    "the question is therefore now that of understanding what the fj plane physically means and what does it mean the @xmath4 relation .",
    "the fj relation correlates the luminosity of a galaxy to the mean velocity dispersion of the stellar system and this in turns is associated with the internal gravitational energy of the virialized object .",
    "it is therefore the analog of the tully - fisher relation ( tf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is valid for late - type systems , where the velocity dispersion is substituted by the circular rotation .",
    "the slope is different ( @xmath73 ) , but this can be easily explained in terms of different values of @xmath7 for each galaxy .    in general , a relation @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a characteristic virial velocity , should be valid for all virialized stellar systems , but the mechanism of radiant energy production is diverse across the systems , being dependent on the stellar populations history .",
    "the fj law provides a relation that supplements the virial relation , linking mass ( and the virialized system internal gravitational energy ) to the production of radiant energy i.e. , to the object luminosity . the mechanisms of production of energy can be however very different and can yield to widely different @xmath34 even among stellar systems , where the mechanism is roughly the same , ultimately associated with nuclear reactions in the star interior . since the stars light emission is independent on the condition of virialization , we suspect that another relation might connect galaxy luminosity with velocity dispersion , in particular if we consider that the sfh is different according to galaxy mass ( downsizing ) .    in this framework",
    "we show below that the fj relation originates from the @xmath4 relation and the zero - point of the vp plotted in this 2d space .",
    "the fj relation is a sort of translation of the black body stefan - boltzmann law valid for individual stars to the case of a galaxy made by an assembly of stars in which the temperature is replaced by velocity dispersion .",
    "it goes without saying that there is no immediate straight correlation between the two physical situations ; however , we will convincingly show below that this is possible and also argue that dynamics ( via the velocity dispersion ) and stellar populations in a galaxy ( the light emitted by stars ) are each other intimately related . to demonstrate that this is possible we proceed as follow .",
    "a star of mass @xmath76 , radius @xmath77 , luminosity @xmath78 , and effective temperature @xmath79 is an assembly of n heavy particles ( nuclei , atoms , electrons can be neglected ) in thermal motion with mean temperature @xmath80 in virial equilibrium , i.e. satisfying the condition :    @xmath81    [ virial ] where @xmath82 is the mean particle velocity in a gram of matter , @xmath83 with @xmath84 the mean mass of the heavy particles , and finally and @xmath85 stands for `` virial energy '' .",
    "consider first the total bolometric luminosity of a star ( i.e. the total energy emitted per second by the surface of a star ) .",
    "this is usually derived from the stefan - boltzmann law , since stars are in good approximation black body systems .",
    "in a star we can measure the luminosity @xmath78 , the effective temperature @xmath86 , and the radius @xmath77 which are related by the well known black body law ( @xmath87 ) , where @xmath88 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the suffix @xmath89 is to distinguish it from the velocity dispersion of stars in a galaxy , usually indicated with the same symbol .",
    "when misunderstanding is obviously avoided , the suffix is dropped .",
    "it is worth recalling here that the luminosity can be derived from the energy content of the black body according to :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the total volume and @xmath92 the total energy of the black body . from this",
    "we obtain the luminosity of the star @xmath93    at this point we verify that the gravitational energy , the mean kinetic energy of the particles , and the black body energy content of the whole star with mean temperature @xmath80 are comparable to each other . taking the sun as a typical star we obtain :    \\i ) the mean density of kinetic energy of the @xmath94 particles in the star is given by : @xmath95 where @xmath84 and @xmath96 are the mass and velocity of each particle and @xmath13 is the number density of particles .",
    "\\ii ) the mean density of gravitational energy is : @xmath97    \\iii ) the mean density of the photon energy is : @xmath98 for a mean temperature of @xmath99 k ( typical value for the sun ) . within the numerical approximation",
    "the three energies are of the same order .",
    "similar estimates can be made for other types of star with similar conclusions .",
    "there is therefore a sort of balance between gravitational and electromagnetic energy densities . finally , using the virial conditions we can also estimate the mean velocities of the particle in a star ( the sun in this example ) which are about @xmath100 km / s , depending on the exact value adopted for the temperature .    given these premises , the luminosity of a star",
    "is also given :    @xmath101    [ lum_u ] where @xmath102 is the total internal energy ( sum of the nuclear and gravo - thermal contributions ) .",
    "we may generalize the above relation by supposing that the luminosity can expressed as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a suitable proportionality factor with the dimension of an inverse of time .",
    "in other words we linked the luminosity @xmath78 to the internal properties of the star , in particular to the mean velocity of the heavy particles .",
    "however the same luminosity can be expressed by means of the black body with temperature equal to the effective temperature @xmath105 of the star ( a few thousands degrees , about @xmath106 k for the sun and @xmath107 for a rgb star ) .",
    "@xmath108    where @xmath109 is the energy of a black body at this temperature .",
    "this implies that the ratio of the external to the internal black body energies is @xmath110 .",
    "this relation can be simply understood in terms of ratio @xmath111 .    in a star ( an assembly of about @xmath112 baryons ) , the mean free path for a particle is given by the ratio of the radius of the star to the cubic root of total number of particles @xmath94 @xmath113 for reasonable estimates of the radius of a star ( @xmath114 cm for solar like object ) and total number of baryons inside a star ( @xmath115 ; we used for the radius of a proton the value @xmath116 ) .",
    "it follows from this that @xmath117 . inserting the value for the light velocity and the radius of a typical star ( like the sun ) one obtains @xmath118 .",
    "the factor @xmath119 secures that the energy density is translated to energy lost per unit time ( a power ) .",
    "what we have done so far is a simple rephrasing of the classical expression for the luminosity .",
    "the reason for writing the star luminosity in this curious way will appear clear as soon as we move to galaxies ,  to systems hosting billion of stars .",
    "we extend now the above consideration and formalism to the case of a galaxy with mass @xmath120 and radius @xmath121 , a large assembly of stars each of which shining with the luminosity @xmath122 . in brief , the luminosity of the galaxy is the sum of the luminosity of the all the stars inside ; the luminosity of each star can be expressed as proportional to the total kinetic energy of gas particles .",
    "therefore we may write @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the total number of stars within the galaxy , and @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are the basic quantities characterizing each star .",
    "the galaxy luminosity can be rewritten as : @xmath129 where the quantities within @xmath130 are weighted averages over the whole stellar population .",
    "note that for galaxies of the same `` size '' ( mass and radius ) these values will be very similar .",
    "finally , like in the case of stars , @xmath131 has the dimension of an inverse of time .",
    "now , thanks to the homologous nature of the gravitational collapse at all scales , it is possible to note that the quantity @xmath132 , i.e. the mean velocity of particles inside a star , turns out to be comparable to the velocity dispersion of stars within a galaxy , customarily named @xmath38 ( in km / sec ) .",
    "it is then possible to write : @xmath133 where @xmath134    it can be shown that even for a galaxy there is a similar balance ( by chance ? ) between the total gravitational energy and total radiative energy emitted by stars so that the relation ( [ lostar ] ) can be replaced by @xmath135 where @xmath136 refers to the galaxy as a whole .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath136 despite its different origin and physical meaning turns out to have nearly the same numerical value of @xmath104 ( see below ) .    to demonstrate the validity of eq .",
    "( [ lostar1 ] ) we proceed as follows . also for a galaxy",
    "we can define a sort of mean free path for stars as the ratio between the radius of the galaxy to the cubic root of the number of stars inside it @xmath137 for typical values of @xmath138 and @xmath124 .",
    "the energy density of the photons emitted by all the stars in the galaxy evaluated at any arbitrary point inside the galaxy is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 refers to the black body at the temperature of stellar sources for which we make the additional assumption of a unique population made of solar like stars with effective temperature @xmath141 , @xmath142 is the volume of the whole galaxy , and the factor @xmath143 the mean black body radiation inside the galaxy .",
    "although the integrand of eq . ( [ ugal ] ) is not strictly correct to evaluate the variation of the black body energy as a function of the galacto - centric distance , it is adequate to our purposes .",
    "the quantity @xmath140 is given by @xmath144 so that for @xmath145 of eq .",
    "( [ ugal ] ) we estimate @xmath146 the mean gravitational energy density for the galaxy is @xmath147 also in this case there is an approximate balance between gravitational and electromagnetic energy densities .    we can then write the equation : @xmath148    thanks to the assumption of uniform distribution of stars and stellar types most contributing to the light in our model galaxy , also the distribution of the photon energy inside is uniform and always equal to the that of black body of similar temperature . furthermore , owing to the very large number of stars in a galaxy the light emitted by a certain region , e.g. within the effective radius , can be assimilated to that of black body of certain mean temperature and very large surface . therefore we may write @xmath149 so that for solar like stars @xmath150 .     and @xmath151 versus the mass of the virialized system ( star or galaxy as appropriate).,width=453 ]    in conclusion the relation @xmath152 is a sort of translation of the bb law of stefan - boltzmann for peculiar black body systems as galaxies are ( that can be viewed as the sum of many bbs ) .",

    "the range of @xmath104 is large , but this not influent for the conclusions derived here .",
    "what is important is that for every galaxy it always exist a combination of @xmath7 ( @xmath153 ) and @xmath38 able to reproduce the total galaxy luminosity .",
    "one might argue if this is true also for spiral galaxies .",
    "we believe that the origin of the tf relation for late - type systems can be likely reported to the same context . here",

    "@xmath2 seems therefore a parameter that could provide information on the `` downsizing '' mechanism , that is on the observed difference in the sfh of galaxies according to their masses .",
    "but , what is @xmath7 and how is it connected to the sfr ?",
    "( [ loki ] ) and ( [ lostar ] ) give consistently for @xmath7 a mean value of @xmath167 @xmath165 $ ] .",
    "where this value come from ?",
    "we believe that the observed value of @xmath7 is linked to the amount of matter burned by nuclear reactions inside stars in each second .",
    "considering in fact only the h - burning of main sequence stars , we know that @xmath168 @xmath169 $ ] comes from the nuclear burning of 1 @xmath170 of hydrogen , so that at least @xmath171 @xmath172 $ ] are burned each second in a galaxy with @xmath173 stars similar to the sun .",
    "the remaining contribution can be easily explained taking into account that the light from a galaxy comes prevalently from rgb stars @xmath174 more luminous than the sun which are burning hydrogen in shells .",
    "now , starting from eq .",
    "( [ lostar ] ) we observe that :    @xmath175    we can therefore recast eqs .",
    "( [ loki ] ) and ( [ eql0 ] ) in a different way in which the star formation rate of a galaxy is brought into evidence .",
    "it follows that at any time @xmath176 after virialization the sfr is given by :    @xmath177    this is an important result because the role played by star formation in shaping the distribution of galaxies in the fp is explicitly taken into consideration .",
    "the relation further tells us that at each cosmic epoch the sfr in a galaxy is not free .",
    "a galaxy can form stars only at the rate permitted by eq .",
    "( [ sfreq ] ) along the whole cosmic history . in other words",
    "once the mass and the potential well of a galaxy is given , only one type of star formation can go on according to the galaxy dynamics and the stellar evolution .",
    "if the galaxy does not merge with others it will not modify considerably its sfr , while if major mergers occurs the sfr could be altered significantly .",
    "notably when the velocity dispersion is high the sfr is low .",
    "this is observed in today etgs dominated by an high value of @xmath38 and the sfr is almost completely absent .",
    "calculated on the basis of the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ sfreq ] ) ( see text ) .",
    "the thin line is the one - to - one relation , while the thick line is the fitted distribution.,width=453 ]    could we test in some way this prediction through observations ? unfortunately testing the validity of eq .",
    "( [ sfreq ] ) would require a database of masses , luminosities and velocity dispersions at different redshifts , while our wings database is made by nearby etgs only .",
    "considering that at @xmath178 the sfr was 0 , we can only predict that the mean sfr of today galaxies will be approximately given by :    @xmath179    where @xmath180 is the luminosity weighted age of the galaxies .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the mean sfr measured by @xcite in 4 distinct epochs from the direct fit of the galaxy seds versus the mean sfr obtained by eq .",
    "( [ meansfr ] ) .",
    "the correlation appears quite good ( @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) , taking into account the various sources of errors affecting both quantities .",
    "( [ sfreq ] ) is the key to understand the fp and the star formation history in galaxies .",
    "its actual form depends on the original choice made to formulate the fp problem , but probably behind such relation there is a sort of balance equilibrium among the different forms of energies that are involved in the stellar systems ( virial energy , radiation , non baryonic energy , magnetic fields , .. ) . for this reason",
    "the next step forward to understand these problems could only come from detailed simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we have shown that the origin of the fp can be traced back to the validity of two basic physical relations : the virial dynamical equilibrium and the @xmath72 relation which is able to explain the existence of the downsizing and the zoe in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "the galaxy luminosity is therefore correlated in two different ways with the velocity dispersion ,  through the @xmath72 relation and the @xmath183 relation which turns out to be the bb law rewritten for galaxy systems .",
    "this is possible because luminosity is independent from the condition of virialization .",
    "since , as demonstrated by @xcite , a fundamental manifold can be constructed for all stellar systems , the easy prediction is that in general the fp and fj relations are different for each class of stellar system ( gcs , dwarf galaxies , late - type galaxies , normal etgs , cluster of galaxies ) .",
    "the diversity is originated by the different zero - points of the vp and @xmath72 planes , or in other words by the different sfh and the different coupling between structure , dynamics and stellar populations .",
    "the combination of the virial equilibrium , of the @xmath72 relation and the validity of the bb law for galaxy systems constrain objects of similar characteristics to the same fp , which is the locus of constant @xmath34 ratio , @xmath27 and @xmath184 at each time epoch .",
    "the projection of the intersecting lines connecting the vp and @xmath72 planes explains the properties observed for etgs in the  plane , in particular the existence of the zoe that in this framework is the natural limit reached by the stellar and dynamical evolution of a stellar system today .",
    "the zp of the fp provides a natural constraint to the possible sfr activity of a galaxy that at any given epoch could not deviate from the track imposed by the mass and luminosity evolution in a given potential well .",
    "conversely , this relation provides the fine - tuning required to keep galaxies on the tilted fp with a small scatter .",
    "equation ( [ sfreq ] ) should be studied now through photometric and dynamical simulations following the details of the mass assembly in stars and their relative luminosities .",
    "naively , we can predict that since the stellar mass is generally increasing , while luminosity and stellar velocity dispersions could vary with the generations of stars , the resulting sfr will probably see various peaks at different redshift epochs depending on the galaxy dynamics .",
    "it will be interesting to see if eq .",
    "( [ sfreq ] ) will help to quantify the problem of the star formation across the cosmic epochs and constrain in some way the mass quenching phenomenon .",
    "first , it will be important to verify if the two principal types of galaxies in the color - magnitude ( or stellar mass ) , color - concentration , and color - morphology diagrams @xcite can be reproduced .",
    "we know that in these plots there are two main regions : the so - called ` blue cloud ' ( or main sequence ) , where galaxy mass correlates with the star formation rate , and the ` red sequence ' where there is no such correlation and galaxies are passive .",
    "the origin of this bi - modality is commonly attributed to the bulge and disk structure of galaxies . in general disks",
    "are bluer in color than bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galaxies with lower stellar mass and lower sersic index tend to be bluer ( and hence have higher ssfrs ) than higher stellar mass and higher sersic index systems @xcite .",
    "similar trends are observed for luminosity and stellar light concentration @xcite .",
    "this idea fits with the found dependence of the sfr on the sersic index and velocity dispersion found here .",
    "unfortunately all such relationships are complicated by the effects of the environment , so that disentangling the various effects on the star formation efficiency is quite difficult .",
