    "in recent years we have learnt some intriguing lessons about the nature of quantum gravity . in this venture a key role has been played by the mysteries posed by black holes .",
    "black holes are puzzling objects .",
    "they have an enormous entropy @xmath0 , but where are the states that account for this entropy ?",
    "the metric of the black hole seems to be unique ( ` black holes have no hair ' ) , which would suggest an entropy @xmath1 .",
    "we have begun to understand the resolution of this puzzle : black holes are _ not _ as classical as we used to think .",
    "quantum effects smear the information in the hole all over a horizon sized ` fuzzball ' .",
    "there are @xmath2 such fuzzball states , and the traditional geometry of the hole can be understood only as some effective description of this ensemble of microstates @xcite .",
    "the second ( and more serious ) puzzle with black holes is the information paradox ( fig.[fone ] ) .",
    "suppose a shell of matter collapses under its own gravity .",
    "it passes through its horizon radius , apparently described to good accuracy by classical dynamics .",
    "no large curvatures are involved at the horizon , so it would seem that quantum effects can not impede the collapse of the shell through the horizon .",
    "but now particle - antiparticle pairs are created in the vacuum region around the horizon and the hole slowly radiates away its mass , in a way that violates quantum unitarity @xcite .    how do we escape this problem and save quantum theory ? in this article",
    "we will argue that the large entropy characteristic of black holes can lead to a surprising quantum effect . in the everyday world around us",
    "the evolution of macroscopic objects obeys classical dynamics ; even though one can ` quantum tunnel ' from one macroscopic configuration to another , the action for this is so small that we can comfortably ignore such processes .",
    "the black hole is also macroscopic , and tunneling amplitudes between states will be small , but the _ number _ of states that are available to tunnel to is @xmath2 , a very _ large _ number",
    ". we will observe that these small and large numbers compensate each other , and allow the collapsing shell to tunnel to a linear combination of fuzzball states .",
    "these fuzzball states do _ not _ have a horizon , and so radiate in a manner that does not lead to information loss .",
    "thus the large entropy of the hole can be the key to resolving the information paradox .",
    "formation and evaporation of a black hole , in the traditional picture . ]",
    "the fuzzball states will play a crucial role in our argument , so let us first discuss their nature in more detail .",
    "in string theory , we can take the fundamental quanta of the theory ( strings , branes etc . ) and put them together to try and make black holes .",
    "it is known that the entropy of black holes can be reproduced by a count of microscopic string states @xcite .",
    "our interest now is in the _ structure _ of these states .",
    "suppose we take @xmath3 quanta , with total mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath3 is large we might think that the the system is classical , described by the traditional black hole metric with mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 ( fig.[ftwo](a ) ) . on the other hand we can look at the detailed construction of the string theory states made by the @xmath3 quanta .",
    "it turns out that _ none _ of the states made by these quanta look like the traditional black hole .",
    "for one thing , the quanta carry a ` spin ' , and choosing an orientation for these spins breaks spherical symmetry .",
    "more importantly , the size of the bound state of these @xmath3 quanta is not of order planck length @xmath6 .",
    "instead it grows as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 such that we get horizon sized ` fuzzball ' states ( fig.[ftwo](b ) ) @xcite .",
    "the property of the fuzzball states that is crucial for us is that _ there is no horizon with a vacuum in its vicinity_. recall that information loss occurs when particle pairs are pulled out of the vacuum by the gravitational field at a horizon .",
    "by contrast , radiation from the fuzzball carries out information just like the radiation from a piece of burning coal .",
    "the problem that we are facing is that we have started with a collapsing shell , and this does _ not _ look like a fuzzball state .",
    "as the shell shrinks it can creates a horizon which has a _ vacuum _ in its vicinity . in that case",
    "we would still face the information paradox , unless we can find some way of changing the collapsing shell to a fuzzball state .",
    "( a ) the traditional black hole has a throat , horizon and singularity .",
    "( b ) the actual microstates are fuzzballs , for which the throat ends in a quantum fuzz . ]",
    "we make two preliminary observations that will be important :    \\(i ) the fuzzball solutions are time _ independent _ states of the hole . by contrast , the collapsing shell is a very special , very low entropy , time _",
    "dependent _ configuration . in a general statistical system",
    ", such a special initial state will evolve towards a generic state , and only then will the system be characterized by its full entropy .",
    "\\(ii ) there are _ two _ timescales associated to the black hole .",
    "one is @xmath9 , the ` crossing time ' for light across distances of order the horizon scale .",
    "the infall of the shell occurs on this timescale .",
    "the other is the much longer hawking evaporation timescale , @xmath10 .",
    "it is known that the entropy of all the hawking radiation from the hole is about 30% larger than the bekenstein entropy of the hole @xcite .",
    "this fact has the following interesting implication .",
    "we can allow the shell to pass through its horizon , and even emit some quanta from this horizon containing _ no _ information , as long as the shell reaches a generic fuzzball configuration before @xmath1130% of the radiation has been emitted .",
    "( subsequent radiation from the fuzzball will of course carry information . )",
    "what we need to understand now is how the shell can transform into a fuzzball .",
    "we conjecture that this can take place through a process of _ tunneling _ between the shell state and the fuzzball configuration.the action for tunneling can be estimated to be of order s_tunnel~1 g r = gm^2 ,  = o(1 ) [ six ] where we have used the black hole length scale @xmath12 to estimate the curvature scale in @xmath13 .",
    "thus the amplitude for tunneling is ~e^-s_tunnel~e^-gm^2 , [ four ] a very _ small _ quantity .",
    "but the _ number _ of fuzzball states that we can tunnel to is given by ~e^s_bek~e^gm^2 , [ three ] a very _ large _ number .",
    "to see how these small and large numbers can play off against each other , consider a toy model .",
    "a particle is trapped in a potential well in a state @xmath14 , but is allowed to tunnel to neighboring wells with a very small amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "let the space in which the particle lives have a very large dimension @xmath16 ( to reflect the large dimension of the space of fuzzball solutions ) ; thus the number of neighboring wells will be @xmath17 .",
    "writing @xmath18 for the state in well @xmath19 , the state of the particle at time @xmath20 can be written as    @xmath21 .",
    "then ~e^-s_tunnel ,  c_i~e^-s_tunnel t~e^-s_tunnel ( as is usual in tunneling problems , we have dropped polynomial prefactors and kept only the dominating exponential . ) thus _",
    "i=1^n |c_i|^2~ne^-2s_tunnel since @xmath22 , the probability for the particle to be in the initial well becomes small after a time t~n^-1 e^2s_tunnel    returning to the black hole we note that since @xmath23 and @xmath13 are of the same order , it is possible that @xmath24 is _ not _ exponentially large",
    ". thus it may be possible for the the collapsing shell to tunnel to a superposition of fuzzball states in a time t_stabilizationt_evap [ one ] after which information will start being radiated out from the fuzzball state .",
    "finally , we discuss the technical computation of @xmath13 for fuzzball solutions .",
    "all fuzzball solutions have the same mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 . but",
    "the details of the solutions are characterized by additional _",
    "charges @xmath25 which total to zero , but whose locations determine the structure of the fuzzball state @xcite .",
    "nonextremal states have orbifold singularities and conical defects linking the insertions of these @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath26 are held apart at fixed distances by fluxes of electric and magnetic fields . to move between fuzzball states , or between a shell state and a fuzzball state ,",
    "imagine a process where we have some dipoles @xmath26 , and we tunnel to a configuration with an additional pair of dipoles @xmath27 .",
    "this process is like pair creation of charges in an external electric field , and its action can be computed .",
    "the action is @xmath28 if the separation of the @xmath27 is @xmath29 , and less if they are closer .",
    "thus we expect @xmath30 , which implies ( [ one ] ) .    in summary , we have found an intriguing quantum behavior for a shell that falls through its horizon radius .",
    "string theory provides us with @xmath2 nonsingular ` fuzzball ' configurations that represent the microstates of a black hole .",
    "once the shell reaches a size @xmath31 , the action to tunnel to these other configurations is @xmath32 , still a large number .",
    "but the smallness of the tunneling amplitude is compensated by the large entropy @xmath33 of states that the shell can tunnel to .",
    "interestingly , this observation uses the curious fact that the black hole entropy is given by the _",
    "geometrical size _",
    "@xmath29 of the hole .",
    "the large entropy which distinguishes black holes from other objects has created an unusual quantum effect , and suggests a possible resolution of the information paradox .",
