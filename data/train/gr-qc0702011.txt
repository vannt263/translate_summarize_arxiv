    "in braneworld scenarios it is assumed that our observable spacetime corresponds to a submanifold of a higher - dimensional ambient space .",
    "basically this picture comes from the idea that matter and non - gravitational fields might be confined to the ordinary four - dimensional spacetime ( the brane ) by some trapping mechanism which would keep extra dimensions hidden from direct observations at an energy level below tev scale @xcite .    of course",
    ", for the sake of consistency , the existence of extra dimensions could not be revealed by gravitational probe either at lower energy regime .",
    "usually this is conceptually achieved by admitting the compactification of extra dimensions .",
    "but , unlike kaluza - klein models , extra dimensions could be much larger than planck length in braneworld scenarios@xcite .",
    "the randall - sundrum type ii ( rsii ) model @xcite , however , surpassing the compactification paradigm , shows that a zero mode perturbation of gravity can also be localized in the brane if it is embedded in a non - compact ambient space such as @xmath0 ( five - dimensional anti - de sitter ) space with @xmath1 symmetry . as a consequence , in the first order approximation , gravity in the brane",
    "is effectively four - dimensional at large distance .    in the rsii model",
    "the brane is infinitely thin and possesses a tension which is responsible for a discontinuity in the first derivative of the metric .",
    "there are solutions involving a real scalar field interacting minimally with five - dimensional gravity which can be considered as smooth versions of rsii model @xcite .",
    "the so - called thick branes are regular domain wall solutions that have a finite thickness and give rise to well - behaved differentiable metrics . in the infinitely thin limit",
    ", these thick brane solutions reduce to the rsii model @xcite .",
    "thus , in this sense , the rsii model might be understood as a kind of idealization of thick branes scenarios .",
    "the confinement of gravity is also valid in thick brane versions of rsii @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying the motion of test particles in thick branes focusing on the problem of confinement and stability of the motion of test particles .",
    "if a test particle ( a meteorite , in a solar system , for example ) somehow gains a small momentum in the fifth dimension direction , what happens ? does the particle leave the brane or does it stay moving around it ?",
    "the motion of test particle in higher - dimensional spaces has been investigated under different approaches @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite necessary general geometric conditions for the geodesic motion to be stable around a hypersurface were established .",
    "it turns out , however , that the rsii model does not match these conditions .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that particles , whose geodesic motion is perturbed , will escape from the brane to infinity in the rsii model @xcite .",
    "as we shall see there is no stable confinement for the thick brane case either .",
    "then , we can conclude that the gravitational force itself is not strong enough to confine test particles in this kind of brane .",
    "therefore , confinement of test particles must be provided by some additional mechanism .    the possibility of localization of matter fields by domain walls was originally realized by rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite .",
    "it was shown that confinement of fermions can be provided by a yukawa - like interaction between the spinor dirac field and a scalar field@xcite .",
    "of course , confinement of test particles must be a consequence of confinement of matter at the quantum level .",
    "here we propose a realization of this confinement mechanism in the non - quantum picture .",
    "we shall see that a stable confinement of the motion of test particle in the thick brane is possible if we consider a direct interaction between test particles and the scalar field .",
    "due to this interaction the particles do not follow a geodesic motion . the interaction with the scalar field",
    "is implemented by a modification of the lagrangian of test particle which is inspired by the properties of the yukawa - type interaction .",
    "consider a real scalar field @xmath2 defined in the bulk , which is minimally coupled with the five - dimensional gravity described by the metric tensor @xmath3(here capital latin indices run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) .",

    "the scalar field depends only on the extra dimension coordinate , @xmath20 .",
    "asymptotically the field tends to the minima values , i.e. , @xmath21 for @xmath22 .    in order to make contact with the rsii set up@xcite ,",
    "let us assume that the five - dimensional ambient space is a warped product space whose metric can be written as@xmath23 where greek indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents the induced metric on the hypersurface @xmath26 , which is supposed to be the ordinary four - dimensional spacetime . with no loss of generality we are assuming here that @xmath27 .",
    "considering the foliation of the ambient space adapted to the gaussian coordinate system given above , the einstein equations can be rewritten in terms of the intrinsic and the extrinsic curvatures of hypersurfaces @xmath28 @xmath29 in the following equivalent form@xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the ricci tensor and the covariant derivative associated to the metric @xmath33 induced on the hypersurface @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the extrinsic curvature of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath38 is the dimension of the ambient space , which , in our case , is @xmath39 .",
    "the metrics @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the metric of the ordinary spacetime ) are related by a conformal factor which depends only on the extra dimension @xmath42 .",
    "it follows , then , that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    under the assumption that @xmath45 , the field equations reduces to a much simpler form .",
    "if we admit that the spacetime metric @xmath41 is ricci - flat @xmath46 , then we have the following equations@xmath47 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath48    of course the solution of these equations shall depend on the explicit form of the function @xmath11 .",
    "however , some general aspects of the behavior of the solutions can be anticipated .",
    "a general feature of a domain wall solution is the existence of a scale parameter @xmath49 which is related to the width of the thick brane @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , in order to have a domain wall solution , the scalar field @xmath50 must be a smooth function interpolating between the two real vacua .",
    "thus , we should have @xmath51 @xmath52 for @xmath53 . as",
    "a consequence , the equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) asymptotically ( @xmath53 ) yield@xmath54 assuming that @xmath55 , the above equations admit a solution in the form : @xmath56 which corresponds to the warping factor of the rsii model if we identify @xmath57 ( the bulk cosmological constant )",
    ".    the proper energy density of the domain wall which exceed the vacuum energy @xmath58 is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the four - velocity of observers which are at rest with respect to the domain wall . using ( [ t ] ) ,",
    "( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) and integrating the energy density in the interval @xmath61 we find@xmath62 dy=-\\frac{3}{\\kappa^{2}}\\left (   a^{\\prime}\\left (   \\eta_{2}\\right )   -a^{\\prime } \\left (   \\eta_{1}\\right )   \\right )   -\\int_{\\eta_{1}}^{\\eta_{2}}\\left [   \\frac { 6}{\\kappa^{2}}a^{\\prime2}+v\\left (   \\varphi_{0}\\right )   \\right ] dy\\label{tension}%\\ ] ]    in the thin brane limit @xmath63 , the energy of the domain wall is supposed to be concentrated around the brane giving rise to the brane tension @xmath64@xmath65   dy\\ ] ] if the thick brane has a well - defined limit to the rsii model , then the metric must satisfy some conditions .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the warping function related to the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "in order to guarantee that the thin brane limit gives the rsii brane , it is necessary that @xmath67 be locally bounded and @xmath68 locally square - integrable for any value of @xmath49 @xcite . besides , the sequence of functions @xmath67 and @xmath69 should converge locally in square integral to @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , where @xmath72 is the step function .",
    "it turns out then that last integral in equation ( [ tension ] ) goes to zero in the thin brane limit .",
    "thus , we have @xmath73   dy=\\left\\ { \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\sqrt{-\\frac{6}{\\kappa^{2}}v\\left (   \\varphi_{0}\\right )   } , \\qquad\\eta _ { 1}<0\\quad and\\quad\\eta_{2}>0\\\\ 0,\\qquad\\eta_{1}<\\eta_{2}<0\\quad or\\quad0<\\eta_{1}<\\eta_{2}% \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] therefore , the energy distribution of the thin domain wall is@xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "if we had considered only the contribution due to the potential we would have found@xmath76    let us mention that an example of a regularized version of rsii brane is the thick brane considered in reference @xcite .",
    "let us consider this version here as it leads to the following analytical solution of the equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a1]):@xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are positive parameters which are related respectively to the vacuum value of the scalar field @xmath80 and to the width of the domain wall , respectively .",
    "in the limit @xmath22 , the warping factor converges to @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in the particular case in which @xmath82 , i.e. , the ricci - flat metric @xmath41 is the minkowski metric @xmath83 , then ( [ metric ] ) corresponds to the metric of a @xmath1 symmetric @xmath0 space .",
    "therefore , the thick brane solution coincides asymptotically with the rsii solution provided the identification @xmath84 is made , where @xmath85 is the bulk cosmological constant . in the thin brane limit , @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the rsii solution",
    "is recovered @xcite .",
    "by definition test particles carry a very small amount of energy in such way that they are affected by external fields but the effects they would cause in the ambient are negligible .",
    "as is well known it is assumed that test particles follow geodesics when they are under the influence of the gravitational field only .",
    "the geodesic motion of a particle with rest mass @xmath88 can be derived from the extremization of the action@xmath89 where the parameter @xmath90 is the particle s proper time and @xmath91 means @xmath92 .",
    "let us consider the motion of a massive test particle in the five - dimensional warped product space ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the equation of motion along the extra dimension @xmath42 is easily obtained@xmath93 where @xmath94 . using the constraint @xmath95 , we can write@xmath96 this shows that the motion of the particle along the extra dimension decouples from the motion in other directions .",
    "multiplying equation([ygeo ] ) by the integration factor @xmath97 , the following fist integral can be readily obtained:@xmath98 taking @xmath26 , we get from the above equation that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 might be interpreted as the amount of initial kinetic energy related to the motion along the extra dimension per rest mass .",
    "thus , we find@xmath101 therefore , given @xmath102 the particle can move only in the region where @xmath103 . in this sense",
    ", we can say that ( [ motion ] ) is equivalent to an equation of motion of a particle under the influence of the potential @xmath104 .",
    "the maximum geodesic distance the particle can reach , @xmath105 , is then given by the condition @xmath106 .",
    "let us now investigate the motion of a test particle in the thick brane .",
    "we shall see that the motion is not bound to the hypersurface @xmath107 .",
    "indeed , the first derivative of the potential is : @xmath108 .",
    "a necessary condition for the existence of confinement of test particles in @xmath107 is that @xmath26 be a critical point of @xmath109 , which , of course , demands that @xmath110 .",
    "thus the function @xmath111 must satisfy the following ` initial conditions ' at @xmath107 : @xmath112 and @xmath113 . according to equation ( [ a2 ] ) , @xmath114 for any @xmath42 , it follows that @xmath111 has an absolute maximum at @xmath26 . to check this",
    "let us suppose that there is a point @xmath79 where @xmath115 .",
    "first , let us admit that @xmath116 . in this case",
    "@xmath117 for some @xmath118 with @xmath119 then , as @xmath110 , @xmath120 would be positive for some @xmath42 , @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath122 , then @xmath123 for some @xmath124 again , @xmath120 would be positive for some @xmath4@xmath125@xmath126 . both cases would be in contradiction with equation ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath111 is non - positive and , as a consequence , @xmath127 for any @xmath42 .",
    "so , we can conclude that any free test particle which acquires a non - null transversal velocity @xmath128 will not stay localized in the vicinity of @xmath107 no matter how small the velocity is , since its motion has no turning point .",
    "this means that geodesic motion in the brane is unstable .",
    "this result is in accordance with prior analysis which has shown that a particle is expelled from the thin brane if its motion is perturbed toward the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "we can illustrate this point by considering the particular thick brane described by the solutions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) . in this case",
    ", we have explicitly @xmath129 ^{-b\\kappa^{2}}-1)\\leq0 $ ] .",
    "it is thus clear that gravity by itself can not localize test particles in thick branes of rsii - type .",
    "then , there must exist some additional mechanism which explains the confinement of them to the brane .",
    "in quantum regime , some mechanisms which play this role are known .",
    "for instance , the dirac spinor field can be trapped in a domain wall by a yukawa - type interaction with the scalar field @xcite . the action for the five - dimensional massless fermion @xmath130 which describes this interaction is@xmath131 where @xmath132 is the coupling constant . when the classical domain wall solution @xmath133 known as kink , is considered",
    "then the field equation for @xmath130@xmath134 presents some interesting features .",
    "first , the scalar field generates mass for the five - dimensional fermion . at the scalar field vacua",
    ", the fermion acquires a mass @xmath135 .",
    "second , there exists a zero mode solution @xmath136 which is localized at @xmath137 i.e. decays exponentially for large @xmath138 and is proportional to the solution of the usual four dimensional dirac field .",
    "the question we face now is how this confinement mechanism can emerge in a classical picture of test particles .    as we shall see confinement is possible if we admit a direct interaction between test particles and the scalar field .",
    "this interaction is carried out by a redefinition of the action ( [ s ] ) .",
    "as we have mentioned , in the quantum picture , the mass of the dirac field is modified by the scalar field . indeed ,",
    "if we admit that the five - dimensional dirac spinor field possesses a rest mass @xmath118 then , due to the yukawa interaction we get the relation@xmath139 where @xmath140 represents the @xmath141-momentum of the fermion .",
    "our intention is to define a new lagrangian in such way that the energy relation ( [ energy ] ) could be derived .",
    "one way to do this is changing the mass term @xmath88 by @xmath142 , then the new action for test particles would read@xmath143 calculating the @xmath141-momentum , @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the lagrangian @xmath146 we find@xmath147 for massive test particles @xmath148 .",
    "it is easily checked that the condition ( [ energy ] ) is satisfied .",
    "of course , the usual action is obtained again turning off the interaction , i.e. , taking @xmath149 .",
    "it is worthy of mention that a similar kind of lagrangian was also employed , in a different context , to describe the interaction between test particles and dilatonic fields @xcite .",
    "let us now investigate the equation of motion of test particles in the warped product space ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the motion in the extra dimension . from the euler - lagrange equation we get@xmath150 where we have used the constraint @xmath151 . multiplying the equation by the integration factor @xmath152 the first integral",
    "can be immediately obtained and can be put in the following form@xmath153   \\label{motion - scalar}%\\ ] ]    the effective potential is now @xmath154   $ ] , which reduces to the previous one when @xmath149 .",
    "now let us study the motion of the particle around @xmath107 .",
    "as we shall see there are thick branes of rsii - type in which test particles can be trapped in the domain wall due to the interaction with the scalar field .    the first derivative of the potential is@xmath155\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity let us restrict our analysis to the case in which @xmath156 , i.e. , the case in which the scalar field is found in the false vacuum state at @xmath107 . then , @xmath26 will be a critical point of @xmath157 only if @xmath110 .",
    "calculating the second derivative at @xmath107 , we find@xmath158 using the field equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) evaluated at @xmath107 , the above expression can be rewritten as@xmath159 where @xmath160 is the value of the potential of the scalar field at the false vacuum , which is necessarily non - negative according to equation ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath161 then for the particles that obey the condition@xmath162 the point @xmath26 will represent a stable equilibrium point . therefore , these particles will be stably confined to @xmath107 if the energy of perturbation @xmath100 is small enough . in this case , the motion will be given by the equation @xmath163 which corresponds to an oscillation of small amplitude @xmath164 and angular frequency @xmath165 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath166 is high enough and @xmath167 is sufficiently small , then the period of oscillation will be so short and the amplitude so small that the movement in the extra dimension could not be detected by @xmath168observers .",
    "it is clear that the confinement is stronger in cases of large values of @xmath160 .",
    "the width of the brane also influence the intensity of the binding of the particle to @xmath107 . in the previous section",
    ", we have seen that in the thin limit @xmath169 tends to a delta function whose support is on @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath160 can not be bounded in the limit @xmath170 .",
    "indeed , consider the inequality@xmath171   } \\left (   v\\left (   y\\right ) -v\\left (   \\varphi_{0}\\right )   \\right )   \\right ]   \\left (   b - a\\right)\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath11 has an absolute maximum at @xmath172 in the range @xmath173   $ ] , then@xmath174    consider now the limit @xmath170 keeping @xmath85 constant .",
    "for @xmath175 and @xmath176 , according to equation ( [ pot - delta ] ) , the integral has a finite value which is independent of @xmath78 and @xmath177@xmath178 but as @xmath78 and @xmath177 are arbitrary , the difference @xmath179 can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "therefore , in the thin limit @xmath180 must increases with no bounds .",
    "it is worthy of mention that for a particle whose rest mass is greater than the critical value @xmath181 , the interaction is not strong enough to keep it bound to the hypersurface @xmath107 .    once more let us illustrate this point by considering the particular thick brane given by solutions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) . in this case , the effective potential is@xmath182   ^{2}}{\\left [   \\cosh\\left ( \\frac{2cy}{\\kappa^{2}}\\right )   \\right ]   ^{b\\kappa^{2}}}-1\\label{potential}%\\ ] ]    it can be directly checked that @xmath183 and that @xmath184 . as we have anticipated in the general case , @xmath26 is a stable equilibrium point for particles that obey the condition @xmath185 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "it can be easily verified also that the confinement is stronger in cases of small domain wall width @xmath186 .",
    "another interesting characteristic is that the intensity of the binding is greater in the case of large values of @xmath85 @xmath187recall that @xmath188 .",
    "it is important to stress that the latter feature is valid to this particular thick brane , but we can not assure its general validity .    in this particular thick brane , as the potential is explicitly known ,",
    "general motions , i.e. , those not restricted to small perturbations , can be studied .",
    "the potential is an even function which vanishes at @xmath26 and tends to @xmath189 for @xmath190 .",
    "if the condition @xmath191 holds , @xmath192 has a maximum value @xmath193 at two points @xmath194 .",
    "therefore the potential is a bounded function : @xmath195 a rough estimate of an upper limit of @xmath196 can be readily obtained by taking the maximum value of numerator and the minimum value of the denominator simultaneously in ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath197 .",
    "then , the initial kinetic energy @xmath100 of the light particles ( @xmath198 can not exceed this amount of energy in order that we have confinement , otherwise they certainly will escape from the brane and will never return .",
    "in the case of confinement , @xmath199 the particle will oscillate around the hypersurface @xmath107 and will reach a maximum distance @xmath105 which is given by    @xmath200   ^{2}}{\\left [ \\cosh\\left (   \\frac{2cy_{\\max}}{\\kappa^{2}}\\right )   \\right ]   ^{b\\kappa^{2}}% } -1=\\dot{y}_{0}^{2}%\\ ] ]    let us define @xmath201",
    ". in terms of this new variable the above equation does not depend on the parameter @xmath79 . then",
    ", it is clear that @xmath202    it is interesting to note that the particle will stay closer to the hypersurface @xmath107 , or in other words , confinement will be stronger in case of thinner domains wall @xmath203 .    now let us consider the general case again .",
    "let us now study the motion of massless spinor particles by admitting that their motion in the fifth direction is given by eq.([motion - scalar ] ) in the limit @xmath204 .",
    "multiplying that equation by @xmath88 and taking the mentioned limit , we get@xmath205 the unique solution for this equation is @xmath26 . as consequence the energy relation ( [ energy ] ) reduces to@xmath206 this means that the particle , which seems to be massless with respect to @xmath207-observers , stays strictly confined to the hypersurface @xmath107 .",
    "this result can be confirmed by analyzing the second derivative of the effective potential , which gives the strength of the binding force between the particle and the domain wall .",
    "as we have seen , it increases for particles with small mass .",
    "then , it is expected that in the massless limit the binding force becomes so huge that the particles can not escape from @xmath107 .",
    "let us now consider the issue we have already raised concerning the motion of a small meteorite ( considered as a test particle ) in the solar system in the context of thick branes . for the sake of simplicity , let us admit that the geometry around the sun is approximately given by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "thus , the five - dimensional metric is @xcite@xmath208   + dy^{2}\\label{schawrzbrane}%\\ ] ] where @xmath209 .    since the schwarzschild metric is ricci - flat ,",
    "the field equations reduce to the same equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "therefore the general analysis of the previous section concerning the motion of test particles in the fifth dimension , which is described by equation ( [ motion - scalar ] ) , is also applicable to the case of the meteorite in the schwarzschild thick brane ( [ schawrzbrane ] ) .",
    "then we can conclude that , for a small perturbation , the meteorite stays bound to the hypersurface @xmath107 and its motion in the fifth dimension might not be directly observed .",
    "we now study the motion in the other directions .",
    "first , let us obtain the euler - lagrange equation for the coordinate @xmath210@xmath211 as usual we consider the particular solution @xmath212 , i.e. , the motion in the equatorial plane .    the equations for @xmath213 and @xmath214 are@xmath215 where @xmath216 and @xmath145 are respectively the energy and the angular momentum measured by an asymptotic observer @xmath217 in the brane @xmath218 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation related to the coordinate @xmath219 can be readily integrated and , using ( [ motion - scalar ] ) , ( [ t ] ) and ( [ angle ] ) , gives@xmath220 note that if there is no perturbation , i.e. , @xmath221 , then @xmath26 is a solution of ( [ motion - scalar ] ) and the equations ( [ t ] ) , ( [ angle ] ) and ( [ r ] ) give the usual four - dimensional motion of a test particle in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "now let us consider the equation of motion parameterized by the time measured by an asymptotic observer@xmath222 it is interesting to note that compared to the usual corresponding equation in the four - dimensional schwarzschild spacetime the eq.([rt ] ) differs only by the additional term @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , if the perturbation is truly small , i.e. , @xmath224 , then , despite the oscillatory motion in the fifth dimension , the asymptotic observer can not detect the existence of a fifth dimension by examining the time evolution @xmath225 of the meteorite .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for the trajectory , i.e. @xmath226 . substituting @xmath227 in the equation ( [ rt ] ) we have@xmath228 it is remarkable that , as in the previous case , the only modification of the trajectory equation , due to the fifth dimension , is again the term @xmath229 .",
    "thus , the influence of the extra dimension in the trajectory of the meteorite might be neglected if the energy of perturbation is small enough .",
    "we have studied the motion of test particles in thick branes of rsii - type .",
    "we have seen that a particle following a geodesic motion does not stay bound to the four - dimensional spacetime if its motion is transversally perturbed .",
    "this means that gravity alone can not be responsible for the confinement of test particles to this kind of brane .",
    "based on the mechanism of localization of fermions in a domain wall by means of a yukawa - like interaction between fermions and the scalar field , we have proposed a direct interaction between test particles and the scalar field by changing the lagrangian of test particles .",
    "we have shown that due to this interaction light test particles , i.e. particles which obey the condition @xmath185 will be bound to the brane for small transversal perturbations .",
    "heavier particles if transversally perturbed will acquire so large an inertia that the interaction with scalar field will not be strong enough to stop their motion into the extra dimension .",
    "we also analyze the motion of test particles in the schwarzschild thick brane . as expected for the consistency reasons of the brane world scenario , in the lower energy regime the motion of test particles does not reveal the existence of an extra dimension , neither by direct observation of the oscillatory motion in the fifth dimension nor by deviation of the motion in the four - dimensional ordinary spacetime .",
