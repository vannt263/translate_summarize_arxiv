    "there are now over 200 extrasolar planets known ( http://exoplanets.eu/ ) , and most of these have been discovered using the radial velocity technique . as a result ,",
    "most of these systems yield the minimum mass of the planet ( @xmath0 ) , its orbital semi - major axis , and properties of the central star .",
    "the data to date have dramatically changed our appreciation of the diversity of planetary systems that can form , and have particularly focussed the community s attention on the role that planetary migration plays in the planet formation process ( see review by papaloizou et al .",
    "2007 ) . as the precision and duration of radial velocity surveys increases , lower mass planets and planets in longer orbits continue to be found . as a result",
    ", it has been suggested that the fraction of stars hosting planets may be as high as 50% ( see udry et al .",
    "therefore , it appears that the planet formation process is relatively efficient .",
    "the generally accepted model of giant planet formation is that of core nucleated accretion ( e.g. , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ; bodenheimer et al .",
    "2000 ; hubickyj et al .",
    "2005 ) in which gas giant planets first form a several ( @xmath18 ) earth mass core of solids via non - elastic collisions in a disk followed by the runaway accretion of gas from the disk once the mass of the core is sufficient to exert a strong gravitational influence .",
    "such a model naturally predicts a positive correlation between the metallicity of the disk ( and parent star ) and the ease with which planets can form : there are more building blocks to form the solid core in higher metallicity cases .",
    "the expected correlation has been suspected for some time ( e.g. , gonzalez 1997 ; santos et al .",
    "2003 ) , and has now been demonstrated in an unbiased way ( e.g. , santos et al .",
    "2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) and has been taken as evidence in support of the core accretion model of planet formation .",
    "the competing model , gravitational instability in a massive circumstellar disk ( e.g. , boss 1997 , 2000 ; mayer et al .",
    "2002 ) does not predict such a relationship .",
    "livio and pringle ( 2003 ) showed that lower disk metallicity reduces the efficiency of type ii migration which may account for some of the increased probability for finding a planet around more metal rich stars .",
    "there is some observational evidence suggesting a higher frequency for planets at smaller separations around metal - rich stars which may support such a metallicity  migration relationship ( jones 2004 ; sozzetti 2004 ) . as a result , the planet ",
    "metallicity correlation may ( at least in part ) be due to a metallicity  migration relationship and may not simply signify a metallicity  formation relationship .",
    "additional observations of extrasolar planets are necessary to distinguish between the competing modes of planet formation and the conditions which affect planet migration scenarios . for example , the core accretion model requires several myr to form jovian planets in a disk ( inaba et al .",
    "2003 ) , while gravitational instabilities could potentially form these planets around very young stars .",
    "jovian planets are suspected around a few @xmath19 myr young stars ( e.g. , coku tau/4 ",
    "forrest et al .",
    "2004 ; gq lup  neuhuser et al . 2005 ) ; however , clear detection and firm mass determinations from techniques such as radial velocity variations remain elusive on such young stars .",
    "transiting extrasolar planets offer the opportunity to determine both the mass and radius of the planet , and hence the planet s density .",
    "such planets allow us to better constrain the variety of extrasolar planet properties and offer another potential way to distinguish between planet formation scenarios .",
    "for example , the high core mass derived for the transiting saturnian mass planet in orbit around hd 149026 ( sato et al .",
    "2005 ) has been interpreted as strong support for the core accretion model .",
    "there are now @xmath20 known transiting extrasolar planets ( http://exoplanets.eu/ ) .",
    "several of these planets have unexpectedly large radii ( see figure 3 of bakos et al .",
    "2007 and discussion therein ) , perhaps suggesting additional heating of these planets other than that from irradiation by the star they orbit .",
    "additional effort is needed to understand the structure of extrasolar planets and their origins .    here",
    ", we report the discovery of the third transiting planet from the xo project .",
    "the xo project aims to find planets transiting stars sufficiently bright to enable interesting follow up studies ( mccullough et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this planet presents some very interesting properties : it has a mass of @xmath0@xmath21 @xmath2  and is in a short period ( 3.2 d ) , eccentric orbit ( @xmath6 ) around the apparently single f5vstar gsc 03727 - 01064 .",
    "xo-3b  has a radius of @xmath4 @xmath5 , making it substantially larger in both radius and mass than most of the other reported transiting planets . in ",

    "the full table is available in the online edition . from the survey photometry of xo-3  ( figure [ fig : xolc ] ) , which has a nominal standard deviation of 0.8% or 8 mmag per observation",
    ", we determined a preliminary light curve and ephemeris , which we used to schedule observations of higher quality with other telescopes , as described in the next subsections .",
    "as outlined by mccullough and burke ( 2006 ) , once an interesting candidate is detedcted in the xo photometry , the candidate is released to an extended team ( e.t . ) of sophisticated amateur astronomers for additional observation . in 2006",
    "september through november and 2007 january through march , transit events of xo-3were observed by members of the e.t . from a total of 4 backyard observatories .",

    "these observatories are equipped with telescopes of aperture @xmath23 m. the telescopes , equipped with ccd detectors , are suitable for obtaining light curves sufficient to confirm the nature of the transit and obtain good timing information .",
    "a network of such telescopes is well suited to observe candidates with known positions and ephemerides . here",
    ", we use two such telescopes in north america and two in europe . unlike the case of xo-1b ( mccullough et al .",

    "photometry is the best we have obtained to date on xo-3b .",
    "we estimate all - sky photometric @xmath24 , and @xmath25 magnitudes for xo-3  and several nearby reference stars ( figure [ fig : allsky ] and table [ table : allsky ] ) calibrated using a total of 6 landolt areas ( landolt 1992 ) . using the hereford arizona observatory ( e.t .",

    ", we obtained spectra of xo-3  with two - dimensional cross - dispersed echelle spectrographs ( tull et al .",
    "1995 ; tull 1998 ) at the coude focus of the 2.7-m harlan j. smith ( hjs ) telescope and via a fiber optic cable on the 11-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "both telescopes are located at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the hjs spectra were obtained in a traditionally scheduled manner , while the het spectra were obtained in queue scheduled mode .",
    "an iodine gas cell is used on the het to provide the wavelength reference for velocity determination .",
    "while an iodine cell is available for hjs telescope , it is not a facility instrument and the observations of xo-3  collected here were done as a part of a radial velocity survey of young stars ( huerta 2007 ; huerta et al .",
    "2007 ) for which very high ( few m s@xmath14 ) velocity precision is not required .",
    "wavelength and resulting velocity calibration is accomplished by taking thorium - argon reference lamp spectra before and after each observation of xo-3  at the hjs telescope . at the hjs we obtained one spectrum per night , and at the het we obtained or two spectra per night . at both telescopes ,",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath28 , and data were obtained on a total of 21 nights .",
    "the two - dimensional echelle spectra were reduced using idl procedures described in hinkle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which include bias subtraction , flat fielding using a quartz lamp spectrum , and optimal extraction of the data .",
    "table [ table : rvobs ] gives a log of the spectral observations .",
    "we follow the same procedure used by burke et al . ( 2007 ) for xo-2b to refine the ephemeris of xo-3b .",
    "we adopt the transit midpoint calculated for the event of 2006 october 16 as our ephemeris zeropoint : 2454025.3967@xmath90.0021 .",
    "all measured transit midpoints used to refine the ephemeris are reported in table [ table : ttime ] . to determine the orbital period , we minimize the @xmath29 difference between the observed transit times and a constant - period ephemeris model . based upon 3 transit events observed either in multiple passbands by the same observer , or observed by different observers , we estimate the @xmath30 uncertainty in the time of the center of an individual transit to be 5 minutes , which we adopt as the uncertainty for each of the transits observed in a single bandpass by only one observer .",
    "the best - fit period is 3.1915426@xmath90.00014days .      using spectra obtained at the het , we measured xo-3 s radial velocities with respect to the topocentric frame using iodine absorption lines superposed on the spectra of xo-3 .",
    "we modeled the extracted spectra using a template stellar spectrum and the absorption spectrum of the het iodine gas cell ( cochran 2000 ) .",
    "for the analysis of xo-1 ( mccullough et al .",
    "2006 ) and xo-2 ( burke et al . 2007 ) , a high resolution spectrum of the sun and the earth s atmosphere ( wallace et al . 1998 ) was used for the template stellar spectrum .",
    "we followed this same procedure initially for xo-3 ; however , the resulting radial velocity uncertainties were substantially higher than we achieved for xo-1 and xo-2 .",
    "we suspect that the higher @xmath12sin@xmath31 of xo-3  compared to these other two stars contributes to this increased uncertainty , but we were also concerned that the higher temperature of xo-3  relative to these stars ( and the sun ) resulted in spectral differences large enough to increase the uncertainty further .",
    "therefore , we repeated the het radial velocity determinations using a high resolution ( @xmath32 ) spectrum of the f5v star hd 30652 from the spocs sample of stars ( valenti & fischer 2005 , hereafter vf05 ) as the template stellar spectrum . the effective temperature of hd 30652 is 6424 k ( vf05 ) , within 5 k of our derived @xmath33 for xo-3(see below ) , and @xmath12sin@xmath34 km s@xmath14 which is close to the value of 18.54 we find for xo-3  below .",
    "the spectrum of hd 30652 is very similar in appearance to that of xo-3 .",
    "using an idl implementation of nelder and mead s ( 1965 ) downhill simplex @xmath35 minimization algorithm , `` amoeba , '' we adjusted parameters of our model spectrum to fit the observations .",
    "the model includes convolution of our model spectra with a best - fitting voigt profile to approximate the ( slightly non - gaussian ) line - spread function of the instrument .",
    "the free parameters of our model are a continuum normalization factor , the radial velocity of the star , the radial velocity of the iodine lines ( which represent instrumental deviations from their expected zero velocity with respect to the observatory ) , and an exponent ( optical depth scale factor ) that scales the depths of the lines as an arbitrary method of adjusting the spectrum of hd 30652 to even more closely match that of xo-3 .",
    "due to the iodine absorption , we could not estimate the continuum level by interpolating between local maxima in the spectrum , so instead we solved for the continuum iteratively , as required to improve the fit between our model and the observations . in the manner described above , for each @xmath3615 ",
    "section of each individual spectrum within the region of the recorded spectrum with significant iodine absorption , @xmath37  , we estimated the radial velocity of the star . from the approximately normal distribution of the resulting radial velocity estimates for each epoch , we calculated the mean radial velocity and its uncertainty .",
    "the 1-@xmath27 internal errors of the radial velocity measurements from the het spectra range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 m  s@xmath14  per epoch .",
    "these uncertainties are an order of magnitude larger than those achieved on xo-1 ( @xmath40 m  s@xmath14 ) and xo-2 ( @xmath20 m  s@xmath14 ) .",
    "we transformed our measured radial velocities to the barycentric frame of the solar system and subtracted the mean radial velocity and report these values in table [ table : rvobs ] .",
    "these velocity measurements are shown in figure [ fig : rvfit ] .",
    "the hjs radial velocity measurement technique used here is described in detail in huerta ( 2007 ) and huerta et al .",
    "we summarize it here .",
    "the radial velocity shift of each observed spectrum is determined by a cross correlation analysis of the observed spectrum with respect to a reference spectrum . to avoid complications which might result from a spectral type mismatch",
    ", we use one particular hjs epoch ( 2454137.8215 ) of xo-3  as the reference spectrum . again",
    ", wavelength calibration is done by averaging the wavelength solution from thorium - argon reference lamps taken before and after each stellar observation .",
    "a total of 15 spectral orders which contain numerous , strong stellar lines and no detectable telluric absorption lines are used in the cross correlation analysis . the radial velocity shift from the 15 orders",
    "are averaged to get the final radial velocity shift for each observation , and the standard deviation of this mean is computed and adopted as the uncertainty of the cross correlation analysis .",
    "barycentric radial velocity corrections are then applied to the observations to determine accurate relative velocities for all the hjs spectra of xo-3 .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty found above from the order - to - order scatter in the hjs radial velocity measurements , there is an uncertainty associated with the fact that our wavelength calibration is based on spectra ( thorium - argon ) that are not observed simultaneously with the stellar spectrum as is the case for iodine cell observations . in order to evaluate this uncertainty , a total of 6 stars from the lick planet search sample ( nidever et al .",
    "2002 ; butler et al .",
    "1996 ; cumming et al .",
    "1999 ) which are known to be stable at the 5  20 m  s@xmath14level are observed each night and analyzed in exactly the same way as we treat the spectra of xo-3 .",
    "the internal uncertainty in the radial velocity shift measurements for these standard stars based on the measured order - to - order scatter is typically @xmath41 m  s@xmath14 . for the 2007 february observing run",
    "( observations 3 - 10 at the hjs ) , the time series of radial velocity measurements for these standard stars show an average standard deviation of 123 m  s@xmath14 , with all but one of these stars showing a measured standard deviation less than 126 m  s@xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we adopt the average value of 123 m  s@xmath14  as the uncertainty due to the non - simultaneous nature of the hjs wavelength calibration for the 2007 february hjs observations of xo-3  and add it in quadrature to the uncertainty from the order - to - order scatter for each observation . for the 2006 october observations , the radial velocity standard star data gives an uncertainty of 132 m  s@xmath14due to the non - simultaneous nature of the target and wavelength calibration spectra .",
    "in addition , huerta ( 2007 ) and huerta et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that there are systematic offsets of the order of 100 m  s@xmath14  in the radial velocity standard star measurements from one observing run to the next , and speculate that this is caused by replacing the spectrometer slit plug between observing runs ( the slit plug is not moved during the observing runs ) . using the radial velocity standard star data , we estimate that there is a systematic shift of @xmath42 m  s@xmath14  between the 2006 october and 2007 february observations .",
    "we correct our 2006 october radial velocity measurements of xo-3  by this amount and add this associated uncertainty in quadrature with the other radial velocity uncertainties described above .",
    "the measured radial velocity shifts and the total uncertainty are reported in table [ table : rvobs ] and shown in figure [ fig : rvfit ] phased to the ephemeris known from the transits .",
    "the uncertainty for the radial velocity ( @xmath43 m  s@xmath14 ) of the reference epoch ( 2454137.8215 ) is set equal to the lowest uncertainty determined for the other hjs relative radial velocity measurements .",
    "an eccentricity approximately equal to zero is expected theoretically for hot jupiters in @xmath44 day orbits ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "2001 ) and was our expectation for xo-3b .",
    "therefore , we expected sinusoidal radial velocity variations for xo-3  with a phasing consistent with the transit observations .",
    "the first two observations obtained with the hjs , taken at phase @xmath45 and @xmath46 are inconsistent with this expectation , forcing us to consider eccentric orbits .",
    "many additional data points are required to adequately constrain an eccentric orbit , so we performed intense observing of xo-3  with both the hjs and the het in late 2006 and early 2007 .",
    "when fitting the orbit , in addition to the radial velocity data , we also use the time of mid transit as a constraint in the fitting .",
    "additionally , since the hjs and het data are on different relative velocity scales , we treat as a free parameter the offset between these two scales . in the orbit",
    "fitting , we keep as fixed the orbital period and phases determined from the transit ephemeris , and treat as free parameters the center of mass velocity of the system , the eccentricity , the velocity amplitude @xmath47 for xo-3 , the longitude of periastron , the phase of periastron passage , and the offset between the hjs and het radial velocity measurements .",
    "we use the nonlinear least squares technique of marquardt ( see bevington & robinson 1992 ) to find the best fit parameters for the orbit , which are given in table [ table : planet ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rvfit ] shows the radial velocity data along with the orbital solution . in this plot , the het data are shifted ( by adding 1192.52 m  s@xmath14  to the het radial velocities ) to match the hjs spectra and the center of mass velocity ( 1002.68 m  s@xmath14 ) of all points is subtracted for display purposes , since our center of mass velocity is based largely on only relative data .",
    "( as a result of these velocity shifts , the hjs velocities in table [ table : rvobs ] have had 1002.68 m  s@xmath14  subtracted from them for display in figure [ fig : rvfit ] , and the het velocities in table [ table : rvobs ] have had 189.84 m  s@xmath14  added to them for display in figure [ fig : rvfit ] . ) uncertainties in the orbital fit parameters are derived by mont carlo simulation of the data : for 1000 simulations we construct fake radial velocity data using the orbital fit and applying gaussian random noise at a level commensurate with the observed data , and then fit this model data using the same procedure outlined above . because the orbital fit produces a minimum reduced @xmath48 , we believe our radial velocity uncertainty estimates may be a little too large .",
    "this can be seen in table [ table : rvobs ] where we report the observed minus calculated ( @xmath49 ) velocities of the fit .",
    "these values are typically less than our derived uncertainties for the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the standard deviation of the hjs @xmath49 values is 122 m  s@xmath14  compared to a mean derived uncertainty of 156 m  s@xmath14 . for the het data , the standard deviation of the @xmath49 values is 90 m  s@xmath14compared to mean derived uncertainty of 169 m  s@xmath14(though this is dominated by a single observation ) , indicating that the derived uncertainties for both data sets are too large .",
    "reducing these uncertainties would reduce the uncertainties in the fit parameters , but we leave them as given , since we can not justify any specific reduction in our measured radial velocity uncertainties . from the fit",
    ", we find the velocity semi - amplitude of the orbit of xo-3  is k = 1471@xmath948  m  s@xmath14 .",
    "as described below , the @xmath12sin@xmath31 of xo-3  is relatively large ( @xmath50 km  s@xmath14 ) , which is substantially larger than most stars around which planets have been discovered ( hat - p-2b is another example of a planet orbiting a star which has a relatively large @xmath12sin@xmath51 km  s@xmath14 , bakos et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the experience of mandushev et al . ( 2005 ) and the similarity between the primary in that system with xo-3  gives concern that xo-3  could be a hierachical triple system in which two lower mass stars comprise a short period eclipsing binary star which are themselves orbiting a more massive , significantly brighter primary in a much longer period orbit . in the case of mandushev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the short period binary stars display tens of km  s@xmath14  velocity shifts , but the strong , broad lines of the system almost hide this signal .",
    "the apparent velocity shift of the system primary is then the result of weaker lines moving around the ( stationary ) lines of the primary , producing line profile distortions which are misinterpreted as radial velocity variability of the primary .",
    "line bisector analysis is a standard technique to look for evidence that line distortions are producing false radial velocity variations ( e.g. , hatzes et al .",
    "1997 ; martinez fiorenzano et al .",
    "2005 ) , and have been used successfully to identify false radial velocity variations caused by star spots ( e.g. , queloz et al .",

    "2002 ; mandushev et al .",
    "2005 ) . to improve signal - to - noise in the bisector analysis , it is common practice to compute the bisector of the spectrum cross correlation function ( queloz et al .",

    "; mandushev et al .",
    "2005 ) . here",
    ", we calculate the line bisector of the total cross correlation function computed from all 15 orders in the hjs spectra used in the determination of the radial velocities .",
    "we then compute the bisector span , which is the difference of the line bisector at two reference levels . here",
    "we define the bisector span , @xmath52 , as the value of the bisector at an absolute cross correlation level of 0.15 minus the bisector at an absolute cross correlation level of 0.75 .",
    "these span values are given in table [ table : rvobs ] . because the spectral regions of the het data which contain strong stellar lines also contain numerous iodine absorption lines , we restrict ourselves to the hjs data for the analysis of line bisectors .",
    "previous studies which used bisector analysis to reveal a false positive in planet searches find a clear correlation between the measured radial velocity and the bisector span ( queloz et al . 2001 ; santos et al .",
    "2002 ; mandushev et al . 2005 ; bouvier et al .",
    "2007 ; huerta et al . 2007 ) . in these cases , whether due to spots ( e.g. , queloz et al .",
    "2001 ; bouvier et al . 2007 ; huerta et al . 2007 ) or due to a hirearchical triple system ( santos et al . 2002 ; mandushev et al .",
    "2005 ) , the full range measured in @xmath52 is approximately the same as the full range of the measured radial velocities .    on the other hand ,",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 2004 ) use the lack of a correlation between @xmath52 and the radial velocity to help confirm a planet transiting ogle - tr-56b .",
    "in addition , for ogle - tr-56b the full range in @xmath52 is less than one third the full range in the radial velocities , which torres et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue is additional evidence for the planetary nature of this object .",
    "figure [ fig : bisect ] shows the bisector span , @xmath52 , plotted versus the measured radial velocity for the hjs spectra of xo-3 . also given in the figure is the value of the linear correlation coefficient and its associated false alarm probability ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) for these data .",
    "in addition to there being no significant correlation between @xmath52 and the radial velocity , the full range of @xmath52 is very small compared to the full range in the radial velocity .",

    ", we looked for an infrared ( ir ) excess in xo-3 .",
    "odonovan et al . (",

    "an f5v star such as xo-3 is expected to have an intrinsic @xmath55 .",

    "thus , the observed @xmath57 color of xo-3 is 0.13 mag bluer ( @xmath58-@xmath27 ) than its expected color .",
    "the slight bluing may be the result of the relatively low metallicity we derive ( see below ) , but there certainly is no evidence for a near ir excess suggesting a hierarchical triple system .",
    "the bisector analysis and the @xmath59 color of xo-3  give us confidence that both the photometric dimming and radial velocity variations we measure in this star are indeed due to a planetary mass companion .",

    "we used the methodology of vf05 , including their minor corrections to match the sun and remove abundance trends with temperature ( negligible in this case ) . because of gaps between echelle orders , the hjs spectra are missing the wavelength intervals 60006123  , which was included in the valenti & fischer analysis .",
    "these wavelength intervals are also missing from our extracted het spectra because the relevant echelle orders span the gap between the two detectors .",
    "we averaged our sme results for the 10 hjs spectra , obtaining the parameter values in table [ table : sme ] .",
    "each value in the last column of the table , labeled `` precision '' because systematic uncertainties are not included , is the standard deviation of the 10 measurements divided by @xmath60 to yield the formal uncertainty in the mean .",
    "the median value of each derived parameter ( not given ) differs from the mean by less than the uncertainty in the mean .",

    "figure [ fig : mcd ] shows xo-3 s spectrum in the region of the b triplet , which is the dominant spectroscopic constraint on gravity .",
    "these three mg lines also have a significant impact on the global [ m / h ] parameter , which is used to scale solar abundances for all elements other than na , si , ti , fe , and ni .    following the methodology of fischer & valenti ( 2005 ) , we interpolated yonsei - yale ( y@xmath61 ) isochrones ( demarque et al .",
    "2004 ) to determine probability distribution functions for the mass , radius , gravity , and age of xo-3 .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of xo-3  is unknown , so we initially assumed distances of 240 , 260 , and 280 pc with an adopted uncertainty of 10 pc in each case ( which affects the width of the resulting distribution functions ) . in order to perform the isochrone analysis",
    ", we need a @xmath62 magnitude corrected for extinction for xo-3 .",
    "we measured @xmath63 and @xmath64 for xo-3  ( table [ table : star ] ) .",
    "these observations give a measured @xmath65 for xo-3 .",
    "vandenberg & clem ( 2003 ) determined empirical color - temperature relations for stars including variations with gravity .",
    "we downloaded their high temperature table ( mentioned in footnote 1 of their paper ) and interpolated in the table to the effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity of xo-3  determined above .",
    "doing so gives a predicted @xmath66 for xo-3 .",
    "as discussed below , the lightcurve analysis and the derived properties of xo-3b  favor a larger stellar gravity for xo-3 .",
    "so , we also interpolate the predicted colors to a gravity of log@xmath67 ( a little more than 3@xmath27 higher than the spectroscopically derived value ) . doing so results in a predicted @xmath68 . these two predicted values are within 0.01 and 0.001 mag of the measured @xmath69 of xo-3 , with an uncertainty of 0.04 in the measured color .",
    "we therefore find no compelling evidence for significant reddening to xo-3  and we adopt @xmath63 as the extinction corrected magnitude of the star .",
    "we used our spectroscopic effective temperature , spectroscopic gravity , and an assumed distance to derive a bolometric correction by interpolating the `` high temperature '' table from vandenberg & clem ( 2003 ) .",
    "we combined the bolometric correction with the observed v - band magnitude to determine stellar luminosity .",
    "then we used the stellar luminosity and our spectroscopic effective temperature , iron abundance , and alpha - element enrichment to interpolate the y@xmath61 isochrones to produce the probability distribution functions in figure [ fig : stellarparam ] .",
    "the parameters we derive place xo-3  above the zero - age main sequence . as a result ,",
    "reasonable fits to the data are possible for pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , if xo-3  were indeed a pre - main sequence star , we would expect strong absorption at 6708  .",
    "for example , in their survey of pleiades f stars , boesgaard et al . (",
    "1988 ) show that the line at 6708   is approximately as strong as the nearby line at 6718   is stars of similar spectral type to xo-3 .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : licheck ] the li line region in xo-3  produced by averaging the spectra obtained at the het ( this region is free of iodine absorption ) .",
    "the position of the line is marked and the nearby line is clearly visible .",
    "the li line is not detectable , indicating that xo-3  is substantially older than the pleiades , therefore we conclude xo-3  is not a pre - main sequence star .",
    "the most probable distance , mass , radius , and age for xo-3  are 260 pc , 1.41 m@xmath70 , 2.13 r@xmath70 , and 2.69 gyr respectively , for our best fit gravity of log@xmath71 . combined with our measured semi - amplitude k = 1471@xmath948  m  s@xmath14 , this stellar mass implies a mass of @xmath72sin@xmath7313.02@xmath90.64  @xmath2  for the planet xo-3b . if we assume that xo-3  is at 240 pc instead , then the most probable mass , radius , age , and gravity are 1.36 m@xmath70 , 1.95 r@xmath70 , 2.78 gyr , and log@xmath74 , still placing the star well above the main sequence . as discussed below ,",
    "one of the unusual properties of xo-3b  is the relatively large radius we derive for the planet .",
    "the planetary radius is approximately proportional to the inferred stellar radius",
    ". the planetary radius could be smaller if we could justify a smaller stellar radius ; however , doing so begins to bring the inferred gravity in conflict with the spectroscopically derived value of log@xmath75 .",
    "taking a 3@xmath27 upper limit , the largest allowed value for the gravity is log@xmath76 , corresponding to a stellar mass of 1.27 m@xmath70 and a stellar radius of 1.62 r@xmath70 for an inferred distance of 200 pc .",
    "together with the measured velocity semi - amplitude , these values imply a planetary mass of @xmath72sin@xmath77 @xmath2where the uncertainty here is just that resulting from the radial velocity fit .",
    "clearly , a trigonometric parallax measurement for xo-3  will be of great value in better establishing both the stellar and planetary parameters .      for additional photometric analysis and lightcurve fitting , all the e.t .",
    "photometric data shown in figure [ fig : etlc ] were averaged into 7.4 minute bins .",
    "binning permitted outlier rejection and empirical estimation of the noise by the scatter of the individual observations , which is helpful in cases such as this in which residual calibration errors can be significant .",
    "differences in the depth and the shape of the transit light curve in different photometric bands are both expected and observed to be substantially smaller than the photometric uncertainties in the e.t .",
    "lightcurves , so we combined the light curve from all photometric bands to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the binning begins with phasing the light curves using the refined ephemeris determined in  3.1 .",
    "the final binned light curve consists of a robust average of e.  t.  photometric measurements in bins 7.4 minutes in duration .",
    "this robust average is determined by first calculating the median and median absolute deviation for each bin and rejecting points in the bin that deviate by more than @xmath78 from the median .",
    "next , the mean and standard deviation are calculated for each bin and points which are more than @xmath78 from the mean are rejected .",
    "this rejection based on the mean and standard deviation is repeated one more time before a final (  robust \" ) mean is calculated .",
    "the final binned light curve is supplied in table [ table : lc ] and is shown in figure [ fig : lcurvefit ] along with the fits described below .",
    "the uncertainty in each binned light curve data point is the standard deviation of ( surviving ) measurements in the bin divided by the square root of the number of measurements in that bin .",
    "the uncertainties in all bins are then multiplied by a correction factor as described below ( the uncertainties in table [ table : lc ] do not have this correction factor applied ) .",
    "we modeled the mean transit light curve using the analytic transit model of mandel and agol ( 2002 ) .",
    "for a planet with an eccentric orbit , the transit model has ten parameters : transit midpoint ( @xmath79 ) , orbital period , stellar mass ( @xmath80 ) , stellar radius ( @xmath81 ) , planet radius ( @xmath82 ) , inclination ( @xmath31 ) , quadratic limb darkening law coefficients ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath85 ) , and longitude of perihelion ( @xmath86 ) . throughout the following analysis ,",
    "the orbital period remains fixed at the period found in  3.1 .",
    "the radial velocity data provide the best estimates for @xmath87 and @xmath88 that remain fixed during the @xmath29 minimization . for each fit presented below , we fix the stellar parameters to specific values based on the spectral synthesis and isochrone analysis presented above .",
    "we interpolate quadratic limb darkening coefficients from claret ( 2000 ) for the cousins r photometric bandpass ( @xmath89 ; @xmath90 ) based on the gravity , effective temperature , and metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) determined from the spectroscopic analysis ( table [ table : sme ] ) .",
    "the remaining parameters , @xmath79 , @xmath82 , and @xmath31 , are allowed to vary and are solved for using the  amoeba \" algorithm mentioned earlier . for input into the mandel and agol ( 2002 ) transit model ,",
    "we determine the projected separation between star and planet , @xmath91 , in the case of nonzero eccentricity following the procedure outlined by hilditch ( 2001 ) . for a given @xmath31 , @xmath86 , and @xmath85",
    ", we determine the true anomaly , @xmath92 , that minimizes @xmath91 ( equation  4.9 of hilditch 2001 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath92 corresponds to the mean anomaly at transit midpoint providing the zeropoint to convert observed times to @xmath93 via kepler s equation .",
    "we then initially fit the light curve assuming the stellar mass ( 1.41 @xmath11 ) and radius ( 2.13 @xmath10 ) derived from the spectral fits as described above .",
    "the free parameters of the light curve fit are then the radius of the planet and the inclination of the orbit ( and the time of mid - transit ) .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : lcurvefit ] .",
    "we then repeated the light curve fits using the extremes in the stellar mass ( 1.33 and 1.90 @xmath11 ) and radius ( 1.49 and 2.36 @xmath10 ) which result from the @xmath94 uncertainties in these parameters derived above .",
    "together , this then gives us estimates of the planetary radius ( @xmath95 @xmath5 ) and orbital inclination ( @xmath96 ) which are also given in table [ table : planet ] .",
    "the total mass of the planet is then @xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "examination of the figure shows that the model does not fit all aspects of the lightcurve : the model ingress and egress appear noticeably longer than the observed ingress and egress .    in order to better model the shape of the ingress and egress",
    "while still maintaining the total duration of the transit , the radius of the star and the planet both need to be reduced and the inclination must increase so that the total chord length the planet traverses accross the face of the star stays approximately the same .",
    "figure [ fig : stellarparam ] shows that from the isochrone analysis , the stellar mass and radius both decrease as the distance is assumed to be smaller .",
    "we have performed the isochrone analysis every 10 pc , so we computed model light curves , stepping down in distance 10 pc at a time from our favored distance of 260 pc . for each new distance",
    ", we adopt the corresponding stellar mass and radius resulting from the isochrone analysis and compute @xmath35 for the fit to the light curve .",
    "the minimum in @xmath35 occurs between 190 and 200 pc . fitting a parabola to the lowest 4 @xmath35 values , gives a best fit to the light curve for a distance of 185 pc which gives @xmath97 @xmath11 , @xmath98 @xmath10 , and log@xmath99 .",
    "this fit is shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : lcurvefit ] . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the the best @xmath35 is quite large ( @xmath100 ) for the 63 degrees of freedom in our fit , indicating that the photometric uncertainties have been underestimated .",
    "we attempt to correct this by determing the multiplicative factor required to give a @xmath101 ( a reduced @xmath102 ) .",
    "the uncertainties shown in figure [ fig : lcurvefit ] have been multiplied by this factor .",
    "having done this , we can then assign as the uncertainty in @xmath103 and @xmath31 the difference between the best fit parameters and those we obtain when @xmath104 . doing so , we find that the transit lightcurve is best fit for @xmath105 @xmath5  and @xmath106 .",
    "the total mass of the planet is then @xmath17 @xmath2 .",
    "this value for the planetary radius is considerably lower than the value derived above from the default stellar parameters . as discussed below , we regard this as a lower limit to the true planetary radius ; however , we note that the ambiguity described here can be greatly diminished by obtaining very accurate photometry of a transit of xo-3  and/or by obtaining a precise trigonometric parallax measurement .",

    "the mass of xo-3b  is quite large compared to most of the known extra - solar planets .",
    "zucker and mazeh ( 2002 ) noted that the most massive short period planets are all found in multiple star systems .",
    "udry et al . (",
    "2003 ) emphasized the general lack of massive planets on short period orbits , particularly for planets orbiting single stars , and interpreted these results in terms of planetary migration scenarios .",

    "the eccentricity of the shortest period extra - solar planets are all quite low ( @xmath110 ) and most are consistent with zero eccentricity ( halbwachs et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is generally believed to be due to either tidal circularization ( e.g. , wu 2003 ; ivanov & papaloizou 2007 ) or the result of smooth orbital migration in a disk which is not thought to produce significant eccentricity ( murray et al .",
    "the eccentricity of xo-3b  is larger than all other planets with periods less than that of xo-3b .",
    "we discuss the eccentricity of xo-3b  further in section [ sec : tidal ] .",

    "the recently discovered hat - p-2b ( bakos et al . 2007 ) is very similar in many respects with a period of 5.6 d , @xmath111 @xmath2 , and @xmath112 . also , the hot neptune gj 436b has a period of 2.6 days and e = 0.15 ( butler et al 2004 ; deming et al 2007 ) .",
    "apparently the assumption , commonly - held prior to 2007 , that short - period planets should have circular orbits was incorrect .",
    "it is now well established that host star metallicity correlates with the likelihood of finding a jupiter mass companion orbiting the star in the sense that higher metallicity stars are more likely to have planets ( santos et al .",
    "2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "the metallicity of xo-3  ( [ m / h ] = -0.20 ) is relatively low , and the above mentioned studies show that planets are found around only @xmath44% of stars with similar metallicity .",
    "there are only two other very massive planets ( @xmath113 @xmath2 ) known around stars ( hd 111232 , hd 114762 ) with metallicities lower than that of xo-3 .",
    "the correlation between host star metallicity and the probability of finding a planet is often taken as support for the core accretion model ( e.g. , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ; bodenheimer et al .",
    "2000 ; hubickyj et al .",
    "2005 ) of planet formation . under that assumption",
    "though , it may be surprising that a few very massive planets have also been found around low metallicity stars .",
    "it has also been suggested that host star metallicity decreases on average as the planet mass increases which appears inconsistent with the core accretion model ( ribas & miralda  escud 2007 ) .",
    "on the other hand , gravitational instabilities in a disk are not expected to produce a metallicity - planet correlation ( boss 2002 ) . taking this notion further , ribas and miralda  escud ( 2007 )",
    "have suggested that the sample of extra - solar planets consists of objects formed via two different paths : core accretion in a disk and fragmentation of a pre - stellar cloud .",
    "the high mass , relatively large eccentricity , and low metallicity of the xo-3b  system would then `` fit '' the notion of ribas and miralda  escud of a planet formed from the collapse of a pre - stellar cloud , but of course the observations of xo-3b  do not prove ( or disprove ) either formation scenario .      potentially , one of the most unusual and interesting properties of xo-3b  is the large radius of the planet . at an age of 2 - 3 gyr , giant planets and low mass brown dwarfs",

    "the smaller planetary radius for xo-3b  is associated with a smaller stellar radius for xo-3 , so for this exercise , we take @xmath115 @xmath10 . we thus compute an effective distance of 0.024 au to use for xo-3b  when using the tables of fortney et al .",

    "a number of investigators have pointed out that stellar gravity determinations are notoriously difficult and the relative error in this parameter is often substantially larger than almost all other measured properties of transiting extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "many of these investigators have elected to use the transit light curve fits in combination with stellar isochrone models to estimate the stellar and planetary radius and hence log@xmath116 for the star ( e.g. , sozzetti et al .",

    "we can compare the gravities determined from the y@xmath61 isochrones and our spectroscopic analysis for stars of similar spectral type to xo-3 .",

    "there is considerable scatter in this figure ; however , in the immediate vicinity of the spectroscopic gravity determined for xo-3 , the gravities determined from the isochrones are lower .",
    "this is the opposite sense to what is suggested by the transit light curve of xo-3 . as a result",
    ", there is no clear indication in this sample of stars that the spectroscopically determined gravity for xo-3  is biased low . when making this comparison , it is appropriate to consider the accuracy of the gravities predicted by the y@xmath61 isochrones .",

    "we also note that results from transit light curve analyses are subject to various assumptions and potential biases that may exist in the models used for the fit .",
    "for example , aufdenberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) confirm the prediction of allende prieto et al .",

    "such a bias will favor models with smaller impact parameters and smaller stellar radii .",
    "therefore , until better data can be obtained for xo-3  ( a precise parallax measurement and/or more precise transit photometry ) , the stellar and hence planetary radius will remain significantly uncertain . at this point , taking the photometric lightcurve and the spectroscopic gravity into account , we estimate the radius of xo-3b  to be @xmath120 @xmath5including @xmath94 uncertainties on both limits . the lower limit is almost certainly too low however , given the results of aufdenberg et al .",

    ": cf ] , an interesting aspect of the orbit of xo-3b  is its significant eccentricity , @xmath6 , because most planets with orbital periods similar to xo-3b  are believed to have already been tidally circularized ( halbwachs et al .",
    "independent of exactly how xo-3b  arrived at its current orbit , it is interesting to consider how long it can remain in such an orbit under the influence of tidal circularization .",
    "the question of tidal circularization of close extra - solar planets has been studied by several investigators ( see adams & laughlin 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the equations governing the tidal circularization of extra - solar planets depend on very uncertain planetary quality factors , @xmath121 ( for example , see discussion in gu et al . 2003 ) and in some cases equally uncertain stellar quality factors , @xmath122 , if considering tides raised on the star by the planet . as an illustration of the difficulty in estimating quality factors , mathieu ( 1994 ) point out that theoretically determined values of @xmath122 imply a slow rate for close binary stars to circularize which is contradicted by observations in stellar clusters of various ages . as a result , many investigators try to use the observations ( of binary stars and extra - solar planets ) to empirically estimate the quality factors . for jupiter mass extra - solar planets , @xmath123 ( e.g. , gu et al .",
    "2003 ; adams & laughlin 2006 ) .",
    "circularization timescales depend linearly on @xmath121 , so we assume @xmath124 to get predictions at the long end of what can currently be estimated . using equation ( 18 ) of gu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and equation ( 3 ) of adams & laughlin ( 2006 ) to estimate the circularization time for xo-3b , we find timescales of 0.29 gyr and 0.33 gyr , respectively , using values corresponding to the large radius ( 1.9 @xmath5 ) for xo-3b .",
    "the circularization timescale in both studies depends on the reciprocal of the planetary radius to the fifth power , so the circularization timescale grows to 2.92 gyr and 3.32 gyr , respectively , using values corresponding to the small radius ( 1.25 @xmath5 ) for xo-3b .",
    "clearly , there is considerable uncertainty in the value of the circularization time ; however , because circumstellar disks appear to be lost after 10 - 20 myr ( e.g. , haisch et al . 2001 ; mamajek et al .",
    "2004 ) , it appears that xo-3b  perhaps should have circularized by now if it originally arrived at its current location while the circumstellar disk was still in place ( i.e. through migration ) .",
    "if instead , xo-3b  has been scattered in to its current location ( e.g. , ford & rasio 2007 ) more recently , there may not have been enough time for circularization to occur , particularly for the parameters corresponding to the smaller radius for xo-3b .",
    "a third possibility is that additional , undetected planets orbiting xo-3maintain the eccentricity of xo-3b  ( e.g. , adams & laughlin 2006 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note though that for planets in short period , eccentric orbits such as xo-3b , the tides raised in the planet can deposit substantial energy into the planet ( e.g. , gu et al . 2003 ; adams & laughlin 2006 ) which can inflate it to radii coresponding to the larger value we measure ( gu et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it therefore appears xo-3b  can again serve as a very interesting benchmark for studies of tidal circularization and tidal heating once a more accurate radius can be established for the planet .",
    "xo-3b  is a massive planet or low mass brown dwarf in a short period ( @xmath125 d ) , eccentric ( @xmath87 ) orbit , around a somewhat evolved f5 star .",
    "there is relatively large uncertainty in the planetary parameters owing to the unknown distance to xo-3 .",
    "the mass of xo-3b  is 11.57  13.97 @xmath2  and the radius is 1.10  2.11 @xmath5 .",
    "the larger mass and radius are favored by our spectroscopic analysis of xo-3 , and the smaller values are favored by the light curve analysis . a precise trigonometric parallax measurement or more accurate photometric light curve date are needed to distinguish between these values .",
