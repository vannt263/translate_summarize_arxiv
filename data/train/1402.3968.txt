    "experimental results for annihilation cross sections of antineutrons on several nuclei at very low momenta across the periodic table have been published by the obelix collaboration more than a decade ago @xcite .",
    "exceedingly large cross sections have been reported below 180 mev / c and features typical of reactions taking place at the nuclear surface have been noted . however , quantitative analyses of those data in terms of optical potentials have not been reported .",
    "in contrast , data for antiproton - nucleus interaction both below threshold ( antiprotonic atoms ) and above have been repeatedly analysed and led to fully consistent quantitative picture of the interaction at low energies @xcite .    comparing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions with nuclei , it is unfortunate that experimental results are available mostly for different nuclei at different energies so that direct comparisons are not possible . only for @xmath0 and @xmath1 interaction with the proton",
    "is it possible to compare directly experimental results . for nuclei",
    "we adopt an optical model as a tool for comparisons between different results .",
    "optical potentials simply related to nuclear densities have a long history in nuclear physics of smoothly interpolating values of observables over energy and over atomic and mass numbers @xcite .",
    "it is shown in the present work that such an approach which is successful for @xmath0-nucleus interactions poses problems when applied to antineutrons .    in sec.[sec",
    ": coulf ] we compare total annihilation cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 at very low energies and describe the mechanism of coulomb focusing which is responsible for large differences at low energies . in sec.[sec : pbarsnuc ] we re - examine results for antiproton - nucleus interactions at low energies showing the high degree of consistency between the various experimental results along the periodic table , both below and above threshold . in sec.[sec : nbarsnuc ] we confront the experimental annihilation cross sections for @xmath1 on nuclei with various calculations .",
    "the increased importance at low energies of coulomb focusing is discussed in some detail .",
    "section [ sec : summ ] is a discussion where it is proposed to match the existing data of annihilation cross sections for @xmath1 on nuclei by measuring annihilation cross sections for @xmath0 on the same nuclei at the corresponding energies in an attempt to shed light on what appears to be a puzzle .",
    "such measurements should be feasible in the foreseeable future .",
    "the obelix collaboration measured total annihilation cross sections for antiprotons on the proton @xcite and for antineutrons on the proton @xcite . from the results shown in fig.[fig : pbarnbarp ] it is seen that whereas the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections tend to be very close to each other above 200 mev / c very large differences appear below @xmath4 80 mev / c .",
    "the @xmath1 cross sections show moderate increase of cross sections as the energy goes down , most likely due to the expected @xmath5 dependence of the @xmath6-wave cross section .",
    "however the increase of the cross sections for the @xmath0 is much stronger than the increase for @xmath1 .",
    "this is the result of the so - called coulomb focusing effect which has already been observed in annihilation cross sections of @xmath0 on nuclei @xcite . in situation of very strong absorption , typical of antiproton interactions , the ` black disk ' cross section @xmath7",
    "is replaced by @xmath8 with m the mass of the proton , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the cm and lab wave numbers , respectively and @xmath11 the black disk radius .",
    "for very low energies ( and momenta ) the second term in the brackets becomes dominant .",
    "note that the @xmath12 dependence increases very rapidly along the periodic table , considering that r changes with a@xmath13 , with a the mass number of the nucleus .",
    "it is therefore expected that annihilation cross sections for @xmath0 on nuclei will increase as energy is lowered much faster than do the corresponding cross sections for antineutrons .    ,",
    "filled circles for @xmath1.,height=302 ]",
    "with energies close to threshold , we begin with antiprotonic atoms , where the experimental results of the ps209 collaboration at cern @xcite provided high - quality data for several sequences of isotopes along the periodic table . detailed analyses of these results have been published in a series of papers , dedicated each to a particular subset of the data such as neighboring nuclei or isotopes of the same element . in the present context",
    "we discuss only _ global _ fits of optical potentials to the entire set of 90 data points relating to strong interaction level shifts and widths in @xmath0 atoms @xcite .    in line with other types of exotic atoms @xcite , the interaction of antiprotons with nuclei at threshold is described in terms of an optical potential , which in the simplest @xmath14 form is given by @xmath15~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the neutron and proton density distributions normalized to the number of neutrons @xmath19 and number of protons @xmath20 , respectively , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the mass of the nucleon .",
    "the complex parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are determined by fits to the data ; in the impulse approximation they are the isoscalar and isovector hadron - nucleon scattering lengths , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath25 transforms these from the two - body cm system to the @xmath0-nucleus cm system @xcite .",
    "a coulomb potential due to the finite size charge of the nucleus was also included in the interaction together with vacuum polarization corrections .",
    "the optical potential is used in a klein - gordon ( kg ) equation to calculate strong interaction observables to be compared with experiment .",
    "note that the kg equation yields to a very good approximation the @xmath26-averaged results from the dirac equation .",
    "this is adequate as the ps209 experimental results do not distinguish between the different @xmath26 values .",
    "for the nuclear densities the @xmath27 may be obtained from the generally known charge distribution by unfolding the ` finite size ' of the proton but various simplifications are required in modelling @xmath28 .",
    "the difference between the rms radii of the neutron and proton distributions turned out to be a significant factor in determining strong - interaction level shifts and widths in @xmath0 atoms @xcite and these differences are parameterized by a linear dependence on the relative neutron excess , namely @xmath29 with @xmath30 close to 1.0  fm and @xmath31 close to zero .",
    "two - parameter fermi distributions are used for @xmath27 and @xmath28 with the ` halo ' shape chosen for the latter where the larger @xmath32 in nuclei with neutron excess is due to larger diffuseness parameter @xcite .",
    "in addition it was shown @xcite that introducing a finite - range folding into the otherwise zero - range potential eq.([eq : pbarspotl ] ) leads to significantly improved agreement between calculation and experiment in global fits to the data .",
    "atoms as function of the neutron density parameter @xmath30 of eq.([eq : rmf ] ) .",

    "three parameters , re@xmath23 , im@xmath23 and @xmath34 were adjusted for each value of the parameter @xmath30 of eq.([eq : rmf ] ) , where @xmath34 is the range parameter of a gaussian representing a finite range interaction with rms radius of @xmath36 .",
    "almost identical results are obtained if a yukawa interaction replaces the gaussian , provided the two have the same rms radius .",
    "earlier work @xcite showed that at the minimum of @xmath33 the isovector parameter @xmath24 is consistent with zero .",
    "the real part of the potential plays a relatively minor role compared to the imaginary part because of the very strong annihilation of antiprotons on nuclei .",
    "the best fit implies @xmath33 per degree of freedom @xmath33/d.f.= 2.2 for 29 different nuclei between @xmath37o and @xmath38pb @xcite .",
    "next we examine the @xmath0-nucleus potential at low energies above threshold which we wish to use for comparisons with @xmath1-nucleus interactions .",
    "measurements of elastic scattering of antiprotons by @xmath39c , @xmath40ca and @xmath38pb were made in the mid 80s and analyzed using standard low - energy optical model methods , see janouin et al . @xcite and references therein .",
    "here we show that a potential very similar to the one derived from fits to @xmath0 atoms is capable of describing the elastic scattering of antiprotons by nuclei near 300  mev / c ( 48 mev energy ) .    above threshold",
    "the optical potential was used to calculate the complex phase shifts @xmath41 for several partial waves from which the observables were calculated .",
    "for example , the total reaction cross section which for @xmath0 and @xmath1 represents , to a very good approximation , the annihilation cross section , is given by @xmath42 where @xmath9 is the c.m .",

    "there is no dependence on the parameter @xmath46 of eq.([eq : rmf ] ) and the comparisons between calculation and experiment involve only the three parameters @xmath23 and @xmath34 .",
    "fits were made to the scattering data for the two targets put together leading to @xmath33 of 127 for 68 data points .",
    "the resulting parameters are re  @xmath47 ) fm , i m  @xmath48 ) fm and @xmath49 ) fm . comparing with fig.[fig : pbarsa ] we see agreement within errors with the i m @xmath23 and @xmath34 values at the minimum of the @xmath33 for @xmath0 atoms . the same applies also to re @xmath23 , not shown in the figure . in a second phase we repeated the fit to the scattering data for @xmath39c , @xmath40ca and @xmath38pb put together , a total of 88 data points .",
    "for @xmath38pb a value of @xmath30=0.9  fm was used following the best fit for @xmath0 atoms .",
    "the quality of the fits and values of parameters remain the same as without @xmath38pb , within errors . the @xmath33/d.f .",
    "of 2.2 for the three targets , relating to five different experiments , is satisfactory .",
    "note that only three parameters are required to achieve this result .",
    "fig.[fig : ca48mev ] shows as an example the fit to the experimental elastic scattering from @xmath40ca .",
    "the overall picture hardly changes when the gaussian folding is replaced by a yukawa folding having the same rms radius .",
    "the present analysis can be extended up to 600  mev / c @xcite with very small changes in the final results .",
    "further tests of the potential model above threshold can be made with the small number of measured total annihilation cross sections for @xmath0 on nuclei .",
    "these are compared to the calculated total reaction cross sections from the above optical potentials which could be somewhat larger than the annihilation cross sections above the threshold for charge exchange reactions .",

    "it is seen that the overall agreement between calculations based on the above optical model and experiment are satisfactory .",
    "it is concluded that the interaction of antiprotons with medium - weight to heavy nuclei from sub - threshold @xmath0 atoms up to 600 mev / c is described well by an isoscalar optical potential that depends very little on energy .",

    "finally we turn to the annihilation cross sections of @xmath1 on nuclei which was the main motivation for the present work . for lack of comparable set of experimental results for @xmath0-nucleus interaction",
    "we base most of the comparisons ( except for one point ) on predictions made with the optical potential .",
    "having demonstrated the ability of an optical potential to produce good fits to antiproton - nucleus observables across threshold without a need for an isovector term , it is natural to compare predictions made with the same optical potential with the experimental results for antineutron - nucleus interactions .",

    "@xcite where the calculations used the best - fit @xmath0-nucleus potential of sec.[sec : pbarsnuc ] also for antineutrons .",
    "it is seen that whereas above 250 mev / c there is reasonable agreement between calculation and experiment , the calculations underestimate experiment by up to a _ factor _ of 3 - 4 below 100  mev / c .",
    "moreover , calculations do not follow the trend of the experimental cross sections .",

    "compared with the calculated @xmath1 cross sections the coulomb focusing effect is clearly seen , as expected .",
    "the start of the @xmath5 rise for @xmath1 is also seen , shifting to lower and lower energies as the size of the nucleus increases .",
    "attempts to improve the agreement between calculations and experiment for @xmath1 by varying the potential parameters failed to reduce the huge discrepancies at the lower momenta unless the range parameter @xmath34 was increased from 1.3 to 3.3 fm , implying a rms radius of 4.0 fm for the folding interaction .",
    "this value is significantly larger than e.g. the finite size of the proton or the pion compton wavelength .",
    "calculated from the potential of sec.[sec : pbarsnuc].,height=302 ]    insight into the working of the coulomb focusing effect may be gained from fig.[fig : nbarscut ] showing transmission coefficients for 128 mev / c antineutrons ( solid curve ) and antiprotons ( dashed curve ) on cu as function of the angular momentum @xmath50 calculated from the potential of sec.[sec : pbarsnuc ] .",
    "the larger cross sections calculated with the coulomb potentials included are due to the increase in the number of partial waves which contribute to the cross section with the ( 2@xmath50 + 1 ) weight , see eq.([eq : trans ] ) .",
    "concluding that a simple global potential is capable of reproducing well all the experimental results on strong interaction effects in antiprotonic atoms is not new @xcite . we have shown here that the same potential produces also agreement with mesurements of elastic scattering of @xmath0 by @xmath39c , @xmath40ca and @xmath38pb at 300  mev / c and with the few measured annihilation cross sections on nuclei .",

    "this is indeed observed with calculated cross sections based on an optical potential which fits all the available experimental results for @xmath0-nucleus interactions across threshold .",
    "unfortunately comparable experimental results for @xmath0 and @xmath51 exist only for the proton as a target and we had to use optical potentials for comparisons with the @xmath1-nucleus experimental results .",
    "however , there is a single experimental result which could be useful in this respect , namely , a preliminary result of the asacusa collaboration for the total annihilation cross section of @xmath0 on sn at 100 mev / c @xcite . table [ tab : skgad ] shows it to agree with the predictions of the optical potential and in fig.[fig : snall ] we see it in relation to the @xmath1 cross sections on the same target .",
