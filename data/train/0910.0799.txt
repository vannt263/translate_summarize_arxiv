    "the present paper is devoted to the study of local metric properties of definable subsets of the @xmath0-adic affine space , with special stress on the local density of these subsets .",
    "it contains also results on tangent cones and existence of regular stratifications .",
    "we shall start by recalling what is known in the real and complex context regarding the local density of ( sub-)analytic sets .",
    "when @xmath6 is a germ at @xmath7 of a complex analytic subset @xmath8 of real dimension @xmath9 of the affine space @xmath10 , the local density @xmath11 of @xmath6 , sometimes called in this setting the lelong number of @xmath6 , has been introduced by lelong in @xcite as the limit of volumes of the intersection of a representative @xmath8 of the germ with suitably renormalized balls around @xmath7 , namely @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the real @xmath9-dimensional ball of centre @xmath14 and radius @xmath15 and @xmath16 stands for @xmath9-dimensional volume .",
    "lelong actually proved that the function @xmath17 decreases as @xmath18 goes to @xmath14 , pointing out , long before this concept has been formalized , the tame behaviour of the local normalized volume of analytic sets .",
    "ten years after lelong s pioneering paper , thie proved in @xcite that the local density of a complex analytic subset @xmath8 at a point @xmath7 is a positive integer by expressing it as a sum of local densities of the components , counted with multiplicities , of the tangent cone of @xmath8 at @xmath7 . finally , more than twenty years after lelong s definition , draper proved @xcite that the local density is the algebraic multiplicity of the local ring of @xmath8 at @xmath7 .",
    "the definition of local densities has been extended by kurdyka and raby to real subanalytic subsets of @xmath19 in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , although the arguments in @xcite and @xcite which prove the existence of the density in the real subanalytic case were given before the notion of definable sets in o - minimal structures emerged , they apply to the real o - minimal setting .",
    "a short proof of this existence result , again produced just before the concept of tame definable sets and involving the cauchy - crofton formula , may be found in the seminal paper @xcite for semi - pfaffian sets . in @xcite (",
    "theorem 1.3 ) , one can find a proof in the real o - minimal setting of the existence of the local density viewed as the higher term of a finite sequence of localized curvature invariants involving the cauchy - crofton formula and the theory of regular stratifications .",
    "of course , in the real setting , the density is in general no longer a positive integer , but a non negative real number , and kurdyka and raby proved an appropriate extension of thie s result by expressing again the local density in terms of the density of some components of the real tangent cone .",
    "the existence of the local density at each point of the closure of a subanalytic set is a manifestation of tameness of these sets near their singular points .",
    "similarly , tameness in subanalytic geometry is also illustrated by the tame behavior of local density , viewed as a function of the base - point of the germ at which it is computed : it is actually proved in @xcite that this function along a given global subanalytic set is a log - analytic function , that is , a polynomial in subanalytic functions and their logarithms ( see siu s paper @xcite for similar results in the complex case ) .",
    "draper s result has been extended to the real setting by comte in @xcite in the following way . recall that if @xmath8 is a complex analytic subset of the affine space of complex dimension @xmath9 at @xmath20 , the algebraic multiplicity of the local ring of @xmath8 at @xmath20 is equal to the local degree of a generic linear projection @xmath21 , that is , to the number of points near @xmath20 in a generic fiber of @xmath0 . over the reals ,",
    "if @xmath8 is of local dimension @xmath9 at @xmath20 , the number of points in fibers ( near @xmath20 ) of a generic linear projection @xmath22 is not generically constant near @xmath23 in general . the idea introduced in @xcite to overcome this difficulty is to consider as a substitute for the local degree of @xmath0 the sum @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the local density at @xmath26 of the germ of the set of points in @xmath27 over which the fiber of @xmath0 has exactly @xmath28 points near @xmath20 .",
    "the so - called _ local cauchy - crofton formula _ proved in @xcite states that the average along all linear projections @xmath0 of the degrees @xmath29 is equal to the local density of @xmath8 at @xmath20 and can be considered as the real analogue of draper s result .",
    "finally , the complete multi - dimensional version of the local cauchy - crofton formula for real subanalytic sets is presented in @xcite ( theorem 3.1 ) , where the multi - dimensional substitute of the @xmath14-dimensional local degree @xmath30 is obtained by considering the local euler characteristic of generic multi - dimensional fibers , instead of the local number of points .",
    "now let @xmath31 be a finite extension of @xmath32 and @xmath8 be a definable subset ( semi - algebraic or subanalytic ) of @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a point of @xmath33 .",
    "when one tries to define the local density of @xmath8 at @xmath20 similarly to the archimedean case , one is faced to the problem , illustrated in [ fstart ] , that the limit of local volumes in general no longer exists .",
    "it appears that the normalized volumes @xmath34 of @xmath8 in the balls @xmath35 has a periodic convergence , that is to say , there exists an integer @xmath36 , such that for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 has a limit @xmath39 in @xmath40 ( see proposition [ lem : pos ] ) , with possibly @xmath41 , for @xmath42 .",
    "the reader having essentially in mind the real case is thus strongly encouraged to start reading this article by the example studied in [ fstart ] that emphasizes this phenomenon .",
    "we resolve that issue by using an appropriate renormalization device that leads us to express the mean value @xmath43 as the local density of @xmath8 at @xmath20 .",
    "another new issue occurring in the @xmath0-adic setting is the lack of a natural notion of a tangent cone . unlike the real case where only the action of the multiplicative group @xmath44 has to be considered , in the @xmath0-adic case , there seems to be no preferential subgroup of @xmath45 at hand .",
    "we remedy this by introducing , for each definable open subgroup of finite index @xmath46 in @xmath47 , a tangent cone @xmath48 at @xmath20 which is stable by homotheties in @xmath46 , that is , which is a @xmath46-cone .",
    "one should note that such @xmath46-cones were already considered more than twenty years ago in the work of heifetz on @xmath0-adic oscillatory integrals and wave front sets @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we prove in theorem [ distinguished cone ] that , given a definable subset @xmath8 , among these cones , some are distinguished as maximal for an inclusion property , and appear as the good tangent cones to be considered , in the sense that they capture the local geometry of our set .",
    "we are then able , by deformation to the tangent cone , to assign multiplicities to points in the tangent cone @xmath48 .",
    "our main results regarding @xmath0-adic local densities are theorem [ mt ] , which is a @xmath0-adic analogue of the result of thie and kurdyka - raby , and theorem [ lcc ] , which is a @xmath0-adic analogue of comte s local cauchy - crofton formula .",
    "an important technical tool in our proof of theorem [ mt ] is provided by theorem [ lipschitz decomposition ] which allows us to decompose our definable set into lipschitz graphs .",
    "such a regular decomposition has been obtained in @xcite and extends to the @xmath0-adic setting a real subanalytic result of @xcite . in section [ swf ]",
    "we prove the existence of @xmath1-regular stratifications for definable @xmath0-adic functions , and consequently the existence of thom s @xmath3-regular stratifications for definable @xmath0-adic functions , @xmath2-regular , or verdier regular , stratifications , and whitney s @xmath4-regular stratifications for @xmath0-adic definable sets ( theorem [ wf ] ) .    during the preparation of this paper ,",
