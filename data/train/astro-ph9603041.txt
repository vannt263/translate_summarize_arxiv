    "@xmath1 doradus ( f0v ) is the brightest member of what appears to be a new class of pulsating variable stars . in recent years , a number of late a- and early f - type dwarfs have been found to be variable with periods of the order of one day ( see krisciunas & handler , 1995 for a list )",
    "this is too long for membership of the @xmath7  scuti class , where the periods are just a few hours .",
    "the period is , in many cases , compatible with that expected for rotation , which suggests that the variability may be due to the rotation of a spotted star ( mantegazza , poretti & zerbi 1994 ) .",
    "however , most stars appear to be multiperiodic and require improbably large differential rotation .",
    "the starspot model for @xmath1  dor has been examined by balona , krisciunas & cousins ( 1994b ) who find that large overlapping spots would be required to give the observed light and colour amplitudes .",
    "the most likely explanation for the variability in these stars is nonradial pulsation ( nrp ) , since it is difficult to understand multiple periodicities in terms of the starspot model or as orbital motion .",
    "multiple periods are typical of nrp , but one needs to prove that the physical parameters determined from an nrp model are realistic and that the other models are unable to explain the observations . in nrp , the light variability is due to the periodic variation in temperature and , to a smaller extent , the change in the shape of the star during pulsation .",
    "pulsation with a period of about one day implies that the dominant restoring force is gravity ( @xmath8-modes ) , rather than pressure ( @xmath9-modes ) as in the case of the @xmath7  sct stars .",
    "furthermore , because the stars show substantial light and radial velocity variations , the averaging effect over the visible hemisphere of the star must be quite small .",
    "this implies that the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath10 , of the pulsation must be low , probably @xmath11 .",
    "aerts & krisciunas ( 1996 ) have analysed 9  aur , a star belonging to this group , using photometry and the cross - correlation profile obtained with the coravel instrument .",
    "they deduce that 9  aur is pulsating in two modes , both having spherical harmonic indices ( @xmath2 ) = ( 3 , @xmath12 ) .    the mechanism which excites the pulsation",
    "is not known at present .",
    "the stars appear to be located at , or near , the red edge of the @xmath7  sct instability strip .",
    "this indicates that the mechanism may be the same as for @xmath7  sct stars ( the ionization of h and he ) , but perhaps modified by convection",
    ".    it would certainly be interesting to examine the line profile and light variations of these stars .",
    "these data may enable us to distinguish between nrp and rotational modulation of a spotted star .",
    "nrp produces line profile and light variations which , in principle , allow the determination of the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath10 and the azimuthal number , @xmath13 .",
    "this can be done by examining the variation of the moments of a line profile and calculating a discriminant .",
    "the value of the discriminant as a function of angle of inclination is used to determine the most probable mode ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the method was developed by balona ( 1986a , 1986b , 1987 ) and extended by aerts ( 1993 ) .",
    "the two periods of @xmath1  dor are stable and well determined from extensive photometric observations : @xmath14 d , @xmath15 d ( balona et al .",
    "more recently , evidence has been found for a third period at @xmath16 d ( balona , krisciunas & cousins , 1994b ) .",
    "( we call this period @xmath17 and not @xmath18 because @xmath18 was used in balona et al .",
    "( 1994a ) to refer to a possible single period , later shown to be incorrect ) .",
    "since the star is bright ( @xmath19 ) and well placed , it was chosen as one of the targets for the musicos 94 programme .",
    "the aim was to obtain a large number of high signal - to - noise line profiles which , in conjunction with strmgren photometry , would decide which of the two models , starspots or nrp , is the correct one and to determine the spot geometry or pulsation modes .",
    "another factor in choosing to observe this star is the rapid change in the spectrum which appears from time to time ( balona et al .",
    "1994a ) . @xmath1",
    "dor is an _ iras _ source with a probable circumstellar dust cloud ( aumann 1985 ) , which may be responsible for this effect .    in this paper",
    "we present details of the observations and reduction procedure and analyse the data in terms of the two models .",
    "spectroscopic data were obtained from four sites during 1994 november : eso ( chile ) , mount stromlo ( australia ) , sutherland ( south africa ) and mount john ( new zealand ) .",
    "the projected rotational velocity of @xmath1  dor is high ( @xmath20 km s@xmath21 ) , which means that it is impossible to find a totally unblended spectral line . the most suitable line is probably that of fe  ii at @xmath225018.450  or possibly mg  i at @xmath225183.619   .",
    "instructions were given to ensure that the @xmath225018.450  fe  ii line was observed whenever possible .",
    "the time - coverage at the various sites is shown in table 1 .",
    ".details of the musicos 94 campaign on @xmath1  dor .",
    "the epoch of the julian day ( jd ) is 2449600.00 ; n is the number of spectra obtained .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one of the most puzzling aspects of @xmath1  dor is the sudden appearance , from time to time , of isolated absorption or emission features ( balona et al .",
    "careful inspection of all the spectra obtained during the musicos-94 campaign has failed to reveal such oddities .",
    "the star appears to have a normal early - f spectrum , though broadened by rotation .",
    "there is no doubt , however , that the light variations of the star can not be explained entirely by three periodic components .",
    "there is a certain level of non - periodicity which is not yet understood ( balona et al .",
    "1994a , balona , krisciunas & cousins 1994b ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations during musicos-94 show evidence for this effect on one night ( jd  2449664 ) , where the radial velocities are substantially smaller than expected .",
    "our new photometric observations confirm the existence of a third oscillation , @xmath23 d@xmath21 , previously suspected by balona , krisciunas & cousins ( 1994b ) .",
    "the existence of three frequencies implies substantial differential rotation on the basis of the starspot model .",
    "this model also fails to account for the great differences which exist between the radial velocity to light amplitude ratios between the two main oscillations .",
    "but the most serious objection to the starspot model is the fact that for @xmath4 radial velocity and light maximum coincide in phase .",
    "one would expect a @xmath24 phase difference for a starspot .",
    "the small radial velocity amplitude also excludes the possibility of a binary companion .",
    "we conclude that nonradial pulsation is the only viable explanation for the observations .    from the light curve and first four moments of the line profile of fe  ii @xmath225018.450  ",
    ", we show that @xmath1  dor has a high angle of inclination , probably @xmath6 and that the three modes may be identified as @xmath25 , @xmath26 with fair confidence .",
    "the pulsation parameters indicate quite a large value @xmath27 km s@xmath21 for @xmath3 .",
    "now the relative flux amplitude + @xmath28 + which gives @xmath29 for @xmath3 , implying that this mode produces a large temperature variation @xmath30 .",
    "this may account for the significant phase dependence of the equivalent width for this mode , whereas the other modes show little or no phase dependence .",
    "the fact that the amplitudes of the colour indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 are larger in this mode is also consistent with the large @xmath33 .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 dominates the radial velocity variation , but that @xmath3 does not , though they have similar light amplitudes , is due to the fact that @xmath3 has a relatively high spherical harmonic degree @xmath34 , whereas @xmath4 has the lower value @xmath35 . the averaging effect in the latter case is much less , leading to a larger radial velocity amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the much larger value of @xmath33 for @xmath3 compensates in the light curve .",
    "it is interesting that all three modes seem to be sectorial retrograde modes .",
    "the frequency of pulsation in the co - rotating frame , @xmath36 , is related to the frequency of pulsation in the observer s frame , @xmath37 , by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the frequency of rotation . if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 d@xmath21 ( @xmath43 d ) .",
    "thus , in the co - rotating frame , the three oscillations have the following frequencies : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 d@xmath21 . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are substantially different and must have quite different radial orders in spite of the fact that they are nearly equal in the inertial frame . on the other hand , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are of the same degree , @xmath10 , probably have neighbouring radial orders .",
    "this information could be used to extract seismological information , but the effect of rotation needs to be taken into account more accurately before this can done .",
    "the success of mode identification in this star is encouraging .",
    "the application of the method to other stars might well result in very interesting results , as in the case of 9  aur ( aerts & krisciunas 1996 ) , but other types of pulsating star may be equally interesting .",
    "for example , an intensive campaign on a periodic be star ( and there are many of these which are bright ) should result in a definitive test of the nrp / starspot models ( balona 1996 ) .",
    "all that would be required is an accurate determination of the radial velocity to light amplitude ratio .",
