    "directed transport in ratchet systems , i.e. , devices rectifying undirected driving forces ( both random and deterministic ) into directed motion of the transported particles or localized structures , is much in the limelight of present activities .",
    "the reason is that the rectifying property of these systems , the so - called ratchet effect , constitutes a theoretical basis for operating brownian motors @xcite which , for example , can be employed to do surface smoothing @xcite or the separation of particles @xcite .",
    "the topic is also closely related to a variety of yet other intriguing noise - induced transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "usually the action of ratchet systems on the transported particles is described by a spatially asymmetric , _ periodic _ potential .",
    "the assumption of strict periodicity of a ratchet potential is technically convenient , but in many systems the validity of this assumption is not guaranteed .",
    "therefore , if a sizable spatial aperiodicity is the result of quenched disorder , it is advantageous to use a _ random _ ratchet potential for describing the transport properties in such systems . within this approach ,",
    "some of these properties that result from quenched disorder have already been studied @xcite .",
    "if the noise arising from the environment can be neglected then the average drift velocity of overdamped particles in a periodic ratchet potential exhibits a threshold dependence on the amplitude of the time - periodic driving force ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "only one transport regime with a nonzero average velocity exists whenever the amplitude of the driving force exceeds the threshold value .",
    "if the amplitude is less than threshold , the particles remain localized mainly within one period of the ratchet potential , although co - existing bounded solutions may exist @xcite .",
    "however , this picture can be changed drastically in ratchet systems containing quenched disorder . indeed , if for a random ratchet potential the threshold amplitude exists and the amplitude of the driving force exceeds this threshold value then the ordinary transport regime , i.e. , transport with a _ nonzero _",
    "average velocity of particles and an _ arbitrary large _ transport distance , emerges .",
    "but if the driving amplitude is somewhat smaller than the threshold value then a _ new transport regime _ characterized by a _ zero _ average velocity and a _ finite _ transport distance is expected to be realized . moreover , since at the threshold amplitude these regimes merge , it is plausible that the transport distance approaches infinity if the driving amplitude tends to the threshold one .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study analytically and numerically these different transport regimes in ratchet systems with quenched disorder described by a random sawtooth potential .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the overdamped equation of motion for particles in a random sawtooth potential driven by a dichotomously alternating force and formulate the main definitions and assumptions . directed transport of particles with a nonzero average velocity is considered in sec .",
    "here we derive an explicit formula for the average velocity in the adiabatic limit and numerically study this transport regime depending on the amplitude and period of the driving force . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider some aspects of directed transport of particles with a vanishing average velocity .",
    "specifically , we derive the average transport distance of particles in the preferential direction and study the transition between the transport regimes with zero and nonzero average velocities .",
    "our main findings are summarized in sec  v.",
    "we study the directed transport of particles governed by the dimensionless overdamped equation of motion @xmath0 here , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 )",
    "denotes the particle coordinate , @xmath3 is a periodically varying driving force of a period @xmath4 , and @xmath5 presents a dichotomous random force which is generated by a random sawtooth potential @xmath6 , i.e. , a piecewise linear random potential such as the one depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "this random potential @xmath6 is characterized by ( i ) statistically independent random intervals of lengths @xmath7 which are distributed with the probability densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 for even numbered ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and odd numbered ( @xmath12 ) intervals , respectively , ( ii ) two deterministic slopes @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and ( iii ) the constraint condition @xmath16 with @xmath17 denoting the average lengths of even , @xmath18 , and odd , @xmath19 , intervals .",
    "the last condition implies that the average value of the dichotomous random force equals zero , i.e. , @xmath20      \\!\\!&= & \\!\\ ! g_{+}s_{+ } - g_{-}s_{- } = 0 ,      \\label{avfor1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the total lengths of the even and the odd intervals on the interval @xmath23 .",

    "we also note that the special case of the above defined potential , when @xmath27 , has been invoked to study the statistical properties of the arrival time and the arrival position of particles in a medium with quenched dichotomous disorder driven by a constant force @xcite .",
    "this chosen form of the random potential in fig .",
    "1 possesses random ( i.e. , non - periodic ) barrier widths with corresponding ( random ) barrier heights and comprises the complexity of more general realizations of random landscapes while at the same time allowing for an explicit analytical treatment ( see also the further remarks given before sec .",
    "v below ) .",

    "although the average values of the forces @xmath39 and @xmath3 are zero , a systematic displacement of particles along the positive direction ( since @xmath40 ) of the axis @xmath41 may nevertheless exist .",
    "in other words , the potential @xmath6 can rectify the periodic motion of particles induced by the periodic alternating force @xmath3 into directed transport .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the ratchet effect @xcite .",
    "we next define the average transport velocity @xmath42 of particles in the following way : @xmath43 where the angular brackets denote an averaging over the sample paths of @xmath39 . in the case of long - lasting period of the driving force , @xmath44 , it is possible to derive the exact formula for @xmath45 .",
    "the starting point is that in the definition ( [ defv1 ] ) we can replace @xmath46 by @xmath4 and @xmath47 by @xmath48 , yielding @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the displacement of the particle during the first half - period of @xmath3 , and @xmath51 is the displacement during the second half - period . as pointed out above , at @xmath52 the particle stays in the initial state for all @xmath46 , and so @xmath53 . a simple analysis of eq .",

    "this quantity is finite and so the average velocity of particles is zero if the probability density of the odd intervals characterizing the dichotomous force has unbounded support .",
    "otherwise , i.e. , if this probability density has bounded support , the average velocity can be either zero or nonzero , depending on the characteristics of the dichotomous and driving forces .",
