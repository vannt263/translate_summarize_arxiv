    "the properties of magnetic impurities in a metal is one of the most intensively studied problems in solid state physics .",
    "the magnetic impurity combines two fascinating phenomena , ( i ) the formation of a magnetic moment ( * mm * ) in a host @xcite , @xcite due to the coulomb interaction and ( ii ) the formation of a non - magnetic singlet state at low temperatures @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of this singlet or kondo ground state has been investigated using a large number of sophisticated methods , for example : scaling @xcite , renormalization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite fermi - liquid theory @xcite , @xcite , slave - bosons ( see for example @xcite ) , large - spin limit @xcite , @xcite , local moment approach @xcite , @xcite , bethe ansatz @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the author has added in recent years a new approach , the fair method , ( fair for * * f**riedel * * a**rtificially * * i**nserted * * r**esonance ) which yields a very compact approximate ground state of the friedel - anderson and the kondo impurity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the most controversial aspects of the kondo ground state is the so - called kondo cloud within the radius @xmath0 where @xmath0 is called the kondo length @xmath1 ( @xmath2 = @xmath3= kondo energy , @xmath4 = fermi velocity of the conduction electrons ) .",
    "the idea is to divide the ground state @xmath5 of a kondo impurity into two parts with opposite d - spins .",
    "the question is whether the conduction electrons compensate the magnetic moment of the d - electron forming of a kondo cloud in each part .",
    "this question has been highly controversial over the last 30 years ( for references see for example @xcite ) .",
    "recently the author @xcite calculated the internal electronic structure of a kondo impurity in real space using the fair solution of the kondo ground state .",
    "this solution consists of only four slater states and is well suited to calculate spatial properties which are difficult to obtain with other methods .",
    "the calculation showed that indeed a kondo cloud of s - electrons compensates perfectly the magnetic moment of the d - electrons in the kondo ground state .",
    "however , to study the polarization kondo cloud experimentally one needs a finite magnetic field because in zero magnetic field the polarization clouds of the magnetic components cancel . the magnetic field should be small enough so that the kondo state is neither destroyed nor dramatically changed by the field . therefore ,",
    "in this paper i will use linear response theory to calculate the electronic structure of a kondo impurity in a small magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic properties , such as susceptibility , of the kondo ground state in a magnetic field have been studied theoretically in a number of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however , to the best of my knowledge this is the first investigation of the effect of a magnetic field on the electronic structure in real space .",
    "the number of real space calculations in the kondo ground state is still rather limited .",
    "recently affleck , borda and saleur @xcite calculated the friedel oscillations in the vicinity of a kondo impurity by means of nrg calculations ( * * n**umerical * * r**enormalization * * g**roup ) .",
    "the author repeated their calculation with the fair method and found good agreement with the nrg approach .",
    "the basic idea of the fair method can be best explained for a friedel resonance with the hamiltonian @xmath6\\ ] ] it has been shown by the author @xcite , @xcite that the * exact * @xmath7-particle ground state of a friedel hamiltonian can be expressed as by the sum of two slater states .",

    "the use of the fair - states is at the heart of my approach to the fa- and kondo impurity problem .",

    "are occupied ( starting at @xmath21 ) .",
    "the states @xmath14 and @xmath22 are mixed .",
    "further details are reviewed in the appendix .",

    "( the path to this solution is briefly sketched in the appendix ) .",
    "@xmath29 because of the spin degeneracy of the electrons two fair states @xmath14 and @xmath30 and the corresponding bases @xmath31 and @xmath32 are needed .",
    "the many - electron state @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is defined as@xmath35 the fair states @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and the d states @xmath38 form a bound two - electron state with negative energy .    the four slater states are abbreviated as @xmath39 ( the interpretaton of @xmath40 is that the mm - up electrons use the basis @xmath41 and the state @xmath42 is occupied ( @xmath43 empty ) while the mm - down electrons use the other basis @xmath44 and the state @xmath45 is occupied ( @xmath46 empty ) .",
    "since the ansatz for the kondo ground state consists of four slater states its secular matrix has the dimension four .",
    "one may consider the four slater states as four basis states of an effective hamiltonian , the @xmath47 secular matrix .",
    "the components of this effective hamiltonian are the expectation values of the original hamiltonian ( [ h_k ] ) between the slater states .",

    "spin - flip processes are only included in the matrix elements between the fair states @xmath51 and the @xmath38 states . in the following",
    "i will refer to this effective hamiltonian - secular matrix as the `` * * secular hamiltonian * * '' .",
    "if one applies a magnetic field @xmath52 in z - direction then the energy of electrons with their moment pointing upwards is reduced by @xmath53 while those with their moment pointing down is increased by @xmath54 . since within this paper",
    "the orientation of the magnetic moment of the electrons is of primary interest i use the symbol @xmath55 for magnetic moment up or in short mm - up and @xmath56 for mm - down .    applying a magnetic field corresponds to an external hamiltonian@xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the number operator for the conduction electron ( wilson ) states .",
    "the interaction of the magnetic field with the conduction electrons yields essentially the pauli susceptibility in which we are not interested at this point . since the magnetic field is introduced in linear response its effect on the conduction electrons can be ignored . however , for finite magnetic fields this is not correct as will be discussed in the appendix together with a sketch of the four slater states in a magnetic field .    since the effect of the magnetic field on the conduction electrons can be discarded the effective perturbation hamiltonian of the magnetic field has the form@xmath59",

    "one obtains for the linear response wave function @xmath90 . because of the energy denominators ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) the contribution of @xmath93 to the magnetic moment is almost @xmath94 smaller and one obtains for @xmath95 in good approximation@xmath96      in numerical normalization group ( nrg ) calculations one uses the susceptibility to define the kondo temperature as @xmath97 .",
    "the susceptibility is , in linear response , @xmath98 . if one applies this method to the example with @xmath60 one obtains@xmath99    in the past we have used the energy difference between the singlet ground state and the relaxed triplet state for the definition of the kondo energy . for @xmath60",
    "this yields @xmath100 .",
    "these two values are surprisingly close together if one considers that there is some arbitrariness in the definition of the kondo temperature and that almost every theoretical approach to the kondo problem has a different definition .",
    "the ground state of the kondo impurity does not possess any spin- or magnetic moment polarization because of its symmetry between mm - up and down states .",
    "therefore one has to separate the ground state mathematically into its two magnetic components to answer the question about the existence of a kondo cloud .",
    "the author showed that there is a kondo cloud in the magnetic components of the kondo ground state .",
    "but this polarization cloud can not be observed in the ground state . to measure",
    "the kondo cloud one has to disturb the ground state sufficiently so that the symmetry between mm - up and down is removed but not too much so that the kondo state is not destroyed .",
    "a magnetic field of the right strength might do the job .",
    "in linear response the interference between the ground state @xmath5 and the linear response state @xmath101 gives the change of the electron density and electron polarization due to a small magnetic field .",
    "the calculation of this interference is quite similar to the author s calculation of the kondo cloud in the previous paper @xcite .    when one uses the slater state basis @xmath102 the ground state @xmath103 has the components @xmath104 and the linear response state @xmath105 has the components @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the eigenvector of the first excited state @xmath108 and for @xmath60 the components have the values @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( see appendix ) .",
    "if we denote the electron density between two slater states @xmath111 and @xmath112 as @xmath113 then the total change of density due to the magnetic field is@xmath114{c}bb^{\\prime}\\left (   \\rho_{ad , ad}-\\rho_{da , da}\\right )   + cc^{\\prime}\\left ( \\rho_{db , db}-\\rho_{bd , bd}\\right ) \\\\ + \\left (   bc^{\\prime}+cb^{\\prime}\\right )",

    "therefore one realizes that there is no change of the charge density . on the other hand the polarization which is defined as @xmath120 reverses sign when the spins are reversed .",
    "therefore one has for example @xmath121 .",

    "the calculation of the charge density of the slater states is described in detail in ref .",
    "a summary is given in the appendix .",
    "the calculation can be performed for the one , two or three dimensional case . since the kondo impurity couples only to a single angular momentum of the conduction electrons ( for example @xmath127 ) it represents essentially a one - dimensional problem . if one defines the charge density as a one - dimensional density @xmath128 ( for example in three dimension the charge @xmath129 between two spheres of radii @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) then the calculation and the results are essentially identical in all dimensions .",
    "( the main difference is that the oscillatory part of the charge shows a dimensional phase shift of @xmath132 see equ .",

    "the first component yields the friedel and rkky oscillations while the second part yields the background electron density which is given by @xmath142 the appendix gives a more detailed discussion of the calculation of density and polarization .",
    "i will divide the calculation into two parts , ( i ) averaging over the fast - oscillating contribution to calculate the overall spin polarization and ( ii ) focus on the fast - oscillating part which will yield oscillations of the spin polarization .",

    "the prefactors of @xmath146 and @xmath147 are smaller by a factor 10 .",
    "however , their contribution is in addition reduced because the bases for mm - up ( and mm - down ) are different in the two states and therefore the interference terms are essentially reduced by the square of the multi - scalar product @xmath148 .",
