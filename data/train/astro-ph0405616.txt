    "the three spitzer space telescope focal plane instruments were designed to investigate four major scientific topics : ( 1 ) early universe , ( 2 ) brown dwarfs and superplanets , ( 3 ) active galactic nuclei , and ( 4 ) protoplanetary and planetary debris disks . of these topics ,",
    "the most important in defining the infrared array camera ( irac ) design was the study of the early universe , and in particular , the study of the evolution of normal galaxies to z @xmath2 3 by means of deep , large - area surveys .",
    "the 3 to 10 @xmath0 m wavelength range was selected because stars have a peak emission at a wavelength of 1.6 @xmath0 m , at the minimum of the h@xmath3 opacity @xcite .",
    "the emission peak is an ubiquitous feature of stellar atmospheres and can be used to determine a photometric redshift for 1 @xmath4 z @xmath5 5 @xcite .",
    "the irac sensitivity requirement was set such that irac could achieve a 10@xmath6 detection of an @xmath7 galaxy at z = 3 .",
    "this in turn required the measurement of a flux density at 8 @xmath0 m of 8 @xmath0jy ( 10@xmath6 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "channel 1 ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) was selected to be at the minimum of the zodiacal background radiation @xcite , and to avoid the water ice absorption band at 3.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "the central wavelengths of the remaining irac filters and their bandwidths ( approximately 25% ) were then optimized ( considering the detector materials available ) to reach the sensitivity requirement and to permit the measurement of a photometric redshift from 1 @xmath5 z @xmath5 5 @xcite .",
    "the number of individual channels in irac was limited by the number of array cameras that could fit in the specified volume . to reduce costs and maximize reliability , moving parts had to be minimized ; hence no filter wheels , only fixed filters , were used .",
    "transmissive rather than reflective optics were used because of limited space .",
    "the pixel size was optimized to achieve the best point source sensitivity for weak sources while maximizing the survey efficiency .",
    "the shutter at the entrance aperture was the only moving part allowed in irac .",
    "although the design was optimized for the study of the early universe , irac is a general - purpose , wide - field camera that can be used for a large range of astronomical investigations . in -",
    "flight observations with irac have already demonstrated that irac s sensitivity , pixel size , field of view , and filter selection are excellent for studying galaxy structure and morphology , active galactic nuclei , the early stages of star formation and evolution , and for identifying brown dwarfs .",
    "irac was built by the nasa goddard space flight center ( nasa / gsfc ) with the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) having management and scientific responsibility .",
    "additional information on the operation and performance of the irac instrument can be found at the irac web site .",
    "irac consists of two parts : the cryogenic assembly ( ca ) installed in the multiple instrument chamber ( mic ) within the cryogenic telescope assembly ( cta ) , and the warm electronics assembly ( wea ) mounted below the cta in the payload assembly area @xcite .",
    "the irac cryogenic assembly , depicted in figure 1 , consists of the following major subassemblies : two pickoff mirrors ; the shutter ; two optics housings , which hold the doublet lenses , beamsplitters , filters , and cold stops ; four focal plane assemblies ( fpas ) that include the detector arrays and associated components ; the transmission calibrator with its source and integrating spheres ; and the housing structure , consisting of the main housing assembly and the wedge - shaped mic adapter plate .",
    "the ca is cooled to the temperature of the mic base plate ( @xmath81.2 k ) .",
    "the ca has a mass of 11.1 kg , is 0.15 m high and 0.28 m wide at its outer edge , and consumes an average of 3.0 mw of power during nominal operation .",
    "the irac wea resides in bay 5 of the spacecraft , operating at near room temperatures ( @xmath910c ) .",
    "all electrical interfaces between the spacecraft and irac pass through the wea .",
    "the wea provides all power and data interfaces to both the spacecraft and to the ca as necessary to conduct the operation of irac .",
    "the wea is connected to the ca via an extensive set of conventional and cryogenic cables , which all pass through a junction box located on the spacecraft near the cta .",
    "the junction box serves as the transition between the conventional and cryogenic cables .",
    "the principal function of the wea is the support and control of science data taking : the generation of bias voltages to the detectors ; the timing of readout sequences ; the amplification and digitization of the analog science signals ; the digital signal processing of the images ; and the transmission of the digital data to the spacecraft c&dh solid state recorders for mass storage , to be followed by downlinks to ground stations at twelve hour intervals . apart from autonomous fault protection , the wea internal software responds only to commands sent by the spitzer command & data handling ( c&dh ) computer .",
    "the wea has a mass of 24.5 kg , and its dimensions are 0.46 m in length , 0.38 m in width , and 0.23 m in height .",
    "it consumes 56 w of power during nominal operation .",
    "the irac optical path is shown in figure 2 .",
    "light enters the ca via two pickoff mirrors located near the telescope focal plane .",
    "the two mirrors are slightly displaced and tilted to physically separate the optical components of the channel pairs .",
    "thus the pickoff mirrors project nearly adjacent 5.2@xmath15.2 arcmin images of the sky to the channel pairs .",
    "the centers of the two images are separated by 6.8 arcmin .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the lower mirror selects the field for channels 1 and 3 .",
    "the reflected beam is incident upon a mgf@xmath10  zns ( cleartran ) vacuum - spaced doublet that re - images the spitzer focal plane onto the detectors .",
    "after the lenses , a germanium substrate beamsplitter reflects the channel 1 beam and transmits the channel 3 beam .",
    "the beamsplitter is tilted by 45 degrees and is in the converging beam .",
    "the channel 1 light is reflected from the beamsplitter , passes through a bandpass filter , and then a lyot stop , which rejects stray light . for channel 3 ,",
    "after the beam goes through the beamsplitter , a filter selects the proper wavelength bandpass .",
    "the filter is tilted at 45 degrees , in the plane opposite the beamsplitter , to correct for the astigmatism introduced by the beamsplitter .",
    "a lyot stop rejects stray light .",
    "the situation is similar for channels 2 and 4 , which are selected by the upper pickoff mirror . in these channels the doublet lens materials are znse and baf@xmath10 .",
    "the channel 2 beam is reflected by the beamsplitter , and the channel 4 beam is transmitted .",
    "all filters are mounted on germanium substrates .",
    "the lyot stops are oversized by 15% .",
    "barr associates , inc . , westford ,",
    "ma , produced the filters , ocli - ajds uniphase co. , santa rosa , ca , the beamsplitters , and spectral systems , inc .",
    ", dayton , ohio , the lenses .",
    "a shutter at the entrance to the ca was designed to block the incoming beams and to permit the measurement of the dark count rate of the detector arrays .",
    "a mirror , mounted on the rear surface of the shutter , reflects the light from the transmission calibration source into the two optical paths . to eliminate the possibility that the shutter could get stuck in the closed position",
    ", it has not been operated in flight to date .",
    "irac has two internal calibration systems .",
    "the transmission calibration system measures irac optical throughput , and the flood calibrators test for detector responsivity and stability . since the transmission calibration system requires that the shutter be closed , it has not been used in flight .",
    "the irac detector arrays were developed by raytheon / sbrc , goleta , ca , under contract to sao @xcite .",
    "channels 1 ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) and 2 ( 4.5 @xmath0 m ) insb detector arrays operate at a temperature of 15 k , and channels 3 ( 5.8 @xmath0 m ) and 4 ( 8.0 @xmath0 m ) si : as detector arrays operate at 6 k. to help achieve the relative photometric accuracy requirement of 2% , the array temperatures are controlled by an active feedback circuit to @xmath5 10 mk peak - to - peak variation from their set points .",
    "both array types are 256@xmath1256 pixels in size , and have the same physical pixel size of 30 @xmath0 m .",
    "cryo - cmos technology was used in the readout multiplexer design @xcite .",
    "the arrays were anti - reflection coated with sio for channels 1 , 2 , and 3 , and with zns for channel 4 .",
    "the power dissipation for each array during nominal operations is @xmath5 1 mw . table 1 lists some of the detector properties .",
    "the operability is the percentage of the pixels in an array that meet specifications .",

    "the temperatures of the fpas are raised to 23 k ( channel 1 ) and 30 k ( channels 2,3,4 ) for approximately 2 minutes and then returned to their nominal operating temperatures in approximately 4 minutes .",
    "the insb arrays were tested and characterized at the university of rochester @xcite and the si : as arrays at the nasa / arc @xcite .",
    "the flight arrays were evaluated at the nasa / gsfc .",
    "irac has one method of operation on the spitzer space telescope : stare and integrate .",
    "the field - of - view is determined by use of the full array ( 256@xmath1256 pixels ) or the sub - array ( 32@xmath132 pixels ) readout mode .",
    "frame times for the full array can vary from 0.4 to 500 sec in 0.2 sec steps , but the following times are standard : 2 , 12 , 30 , 100 , and 200 sec , except that channel 4 uses two or four 50-sec frames instead of 100 and 200 sec frames , respectively .    in the subarray mode , a 32@xmath132 pixel region is read out at a faster rate .",
    "the standard frame times are : 0.02 , 0.1 , and 0.4 sec ; other times can be commanded in steps of 10 msec . each data collection command in subarray mode produces 64 image frames , taken consecutively with no dead time between frames .",
    "this mode is primarily for observing bright sources that would otherwise saturate the array , or for observing time - critical events where a finer time resolution is required .",
    "this mode was used to measure the pointing jitter of the telescope .    during an integration data",
    "are taken using a fowler sampling method @xcite to reduce the effective read noise .",
    "this mode of sampling consists of taking n non - destructive reads immediately after the reset ( pedestal levels ) and another n non - destructive reads near the end of the integration ( signal levels ) .",
    "the average of the pedestal levels is subtracted from the average of the signal levels to derive the signal .",
    "the averaging and subtraction of the two sets of reads is performed in the irac on - board electronics to generate a single image from each array , which is stored and transmitted to the ground .",
    "n can vary from 1 to 64 .",
    "the fowler n used for an observation will depend on integration time and has been selected to maximize the s / n at each frame time , based on in - flight performance tests .",
    "irac is often used in a high dynamic range mode where a long exposure is preceded by one or more short exposures : 0.6 , 12 sec ; 1.2 , 30 sec ; 0.6 , 12 , 100 sec ; and 0.6 , 12 , 200 sec .",
    "irac is capable of operating each of its four arrays independently and/or simultaneously . in normal flight operation",

    "the point source sensitivities for the frame times available to irac are shown in table 2 . for each frame time and channel ,",
    "the 1@xmath6 sensitivity in @xmath0jy is given for the low background case ( near the ecliptic poles ) .",
    "the values were calculated based on the sensitivity model given by @xcite , using measured in - flight values for the read noise , pixel size , noise pixels , background , and total system throughput .",

    "channels 1 and 2 deviate from this rule in approximately 3000 seconds , which indicates that these channels are approaching the source completeness confusion limit ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the deviation occurs at about 1 @xmath0jy ( 5@xmath6 ) , which is slightly fainter than the predictions for the irac confusion limit @xcite .    for extended emission in channels 3 and 4 ,",
    "the calibration was found to be significantly different than expected from the calibration derived from a point source .",
    "the calibration aperture ( 10 pixel radius ; 122 aperture radius ) does not capture all of the light from the calibration sources so the extended sky emission appears too bright . for photometry using different apertures , the estimated correction is listed in table 6.4 of the spitzer observer s manual .",
    "irac s optics provide diffraction - limited imaging , with wavefront errors @xmath11 in each channel .",
    "the in - flight irac image quality is limited by a combination of the optical quality of the spitzer telescope , which is diffraction limited at 5.4 @xmath0 m , and the size of the irac pixels .",

    "the fwhm for `` centered psf '' is for cases where the star was most closely centered in a pixel .",
    "the fifth column in table 2 is the percentage of the total flux in the central pixel for a point source that is well - centered in a pixel . the flux in the central pixel for a random observation will be lower , because the psf of the telescope is rather undersampled at the irac pixel scale except in channel 4 .",
    "the strehl ratios observed are 0.37 , 0.58 , 0.62 , and 0.95 for channels 1 - 4 respectively .",
    "the strehl ratio for channel 3 , after correction for scattered light in the array detector , is 0.71 .",
    "there is a small amount of distortion over the irac fov ( table 3 ) . a quadratic distortion model is provided in the spitzer science center ( ssc ) basic calibrated data ( bcd ) pipeline which fits in - flight data at rms @xmath502 ( channels 1 and 2 ) and @xmath503 ( channels 3 and 4 ) across the full arrays .",
    "diffuse stray light from outside the irac fov is scattered into the active region of the irac detectors in all four channels .",
    "the problem is more significant in channels 1 and 2 than in channels 3 and 4 . in channels 1 and 2",
    "the stray light pattern due to diffuse sources resembles a `` butterfly '' , while in channels 3 and 4 it resembles a `` tic - tac - toe '' board .",
    "a discussion of these effects and example images are given by @xcite .",
    "these artifacts are due to zodiacal light scattered onto the arrays , possibly reflected from a hole in the fpa covers in channels 1 and 2 , and from reflective surfaces outside the edges of channel 3 and 4 arrays . the stray light scales with zodiacal light , which is the light source for the flat fields , so the stray pattern contaminates the flats and all irac images .",
    "the `` butterfly wings '' have amplitudes of about 5% of the background intensity .",
    "the pipeline subtracts a model for the tic - tac - toe and butterfly patterns for the data , scaled based on a model for the zodiacal light intensity @xcite at the location and time of the observation . to the extent the model is accurate , this corrects for the stray light contamination .",
    "stars that fall in specific regions just outside the array edges scatter light into the detectors and produce distinctive patterns of scattered light on the array . scattered light avoidance zones have been identified in each channel .",
    "observers should avoid placing bright stars in these zones if their observations are sensitive to scattered light .",
    "typically , in channels 1 and 2 about 2% of the light from a star is scattered into a `` splatter pattern '' , which has a peak intensity of about 0.2% of the light from the star .",
    "the avoidance zones for channels 3 and 4 are a narrow strip about 3 pixels wide , 16 pixels outside of the array and surrounding it .",
    "the overall requirement for the irac mission is that the system photometric responsivity be calibrated to a relative accuracy of 2% and that the absolute accuracy of the data set be determined to better than 10% .",
    "we expect that both of these requirements will be achieved .",
    "currently 25% of the time that irac is on is devoted to calibration , but the excellent stability of irac will result in a significant decrease in that fraction .",
    "the irac system throughput and optical performance are governed by a combination of the system components , including the lenses , beamsplitters , filters , mirrors , and detectors .",
    "figure 3 gives the system throughput , including transmission of the telescope , irac optics , and quantum efficiency of the detectors @xcite .",
    "for each irac channel , both polarizations were measured @xcite , and the average polarization is shown as a solid curve .",
    "[ fig3 ]    the system parameters are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the isophotal wavelength @xmath12 is the wavelength which must be assigned to the monochromatic flux density derived from a broadband measurement .",
    "the isophotal wavelength is defined as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the measured in - band flux , @xmath15 is the irradiance at the entrance aperture of the telescope , @xmath16 is the spectral response of the system , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 define the wavelength range of interest .",
    "we calibrate the flux densities for a nominal spectrum @xmath19 = constant .",
    "for source spectra with a range of slopes , @xmath20 from 2 to + 2 , the color corrections are very close to unity ( 0.99 to 1.02 ) .",

    "stars with a range of spectral indices and fluxes are observed at a number of positions across the array and many times throughout the mission to monitor any changes that may occur . to calculate vega magnitudes from the calibrated irac images , use the following zero - magnitude fluxes : 277.5 , 179.5 , 116.6 , and 63.1 jy for channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "these fluxes were calculated from the irac throughput values and the absolute spectra at irac wavelengths @xcite .      in - flight data",

    "the detector linearity was measured during ground testing and verified during flight .",
    "the flat field for each channel is defined as the factors by which one must correct each pixel to give the same value at a particular flux for uniform illumination .",
    "the factors include any field - dependent optical transmission effects as well as the responsivity of the pixel and output electronics gain .",
    "sky flats are obtained using a network of 24 high zodiacal background regions of the sky in the ecliptic plane , ensuring a relatively uniform illumination with a reasonable amount of flux .",
    "if the data are taken with an appropriate dither pattern , it is possible to relate the total response of each pixel to that of all others .",
    "one such region is observed at the beginning and end of each irac campaign .",
    "the data are reduced and combined to construct a flat field image for each channel , which is then divided into the science data .",
    "the detector dark currents are generally insignificant compared to the sky background .",
    "however , there is a significant offset or bias ( which can be positive or negative ) in a dark frame , which must be subtracted from the observations . especially for shorter frames ,",
    "the `` dark '' images are mostly due to electronic bias differences , rather than true dark current .",
    "therefore , the number of electrons in a dark image does not scale linearly with exposure time .",
    "the shutter has never been used in flight , and therefore isolated dark / bias data can not be taken . instead ,",
    "ground - based `` lab '' darks are used , in conjunction with sky darks which measure changes to the darks that have occurred since launch .    as part of routine operations a dark region of the sky near the north ecliptic pole",
    "is observed at the beginning and end of an irac campaign , and every three days during the campaign .",
    "these data are reduced and combined in such a way as to reject stars and other astronomical objects with size scales smaller than the irac array .",
    "the resulting image of the minimal uniform sky background contains both the bias and the dark current . when subtracted from the routine science data",
    ", this will eliminate both of these instrumental signatures .",
    "the dark frames , when corrected for changes in the zodiacal background flux , remain very stable from campaign to campaign .    in general",
    ", the first frame of any sequence of images tends to have a different median value from other frames in the sequence , hence the name `` first frame effect . ''",
    "the largest offsets occur when a frame is taken with a very short interval from the preceding image , which occurs when multiple frames are commanded at once .",
    "such commands have been eliminated from irac science observations , so that there is always a finite interval between one frame and its predecessor . since many irac observations will take only one image at each sky position , and there is an 8 to 60 second delay while spitzer points and settles to a new position , the `` first frame effect '' is reduced significantly .",
    "the correction for the first frame effect was derived from pre - flight ground - based data .      in flight ,",
    "cosmic rays excite approximately 3 pixels per second in channels 1 and 2 and approximately 5 pixels per second in channels 3 and 4 .",
    "this is close to the predicted rate @xcite .",
    "the most common cosmic rays do not affect the pixel performance in subsequent frames and are confined to a few pixels around the peak .",
    "the cosmic ray effects in channel 1 and 2 are more compact than those in channels 3 and 4 , which have thicker detectors . in these latter channels",
    "the cosmic ray effects appear as streaks and blobs .",
    "however , other events can cause streaks or other multiple pixel structures in the array , and less common energetic and high - z events can cause image artifacts in subsequent frames .",
    "most of the cosmic ray effects are removed by the post - bcd pipeline processing for observations that are well dithered .    on 2003",
    "october 28 , spitzer encountered a large solar proton flare with an integrated dose of 1.6 x 10@xmath21 p/@xmath22 for proton energies greater than 50 mev .",
    "irac was powered off at the time .",
    "after several thermal anneals of the arrays following the flare , only a few ( @xmath920 ) new hot pixels were detected , all in the channel 4 array .",
    "array detector artifacts known before launch or discovered in flight include : persistent images in channels 1 and 4 , multiplexer bleed , column pulldown , and banding .",
    "these effects are described in more detail in the ssc observer s manual and in articles by @xcite . to erase persistent images both channel 1 and 4",
    "are annealed simultaneously every 12 hours ( after each downlink ) and bright source observations are scheduled only near the end of an irac campaign .",
    "column pulldown , bright source multiplexer bleed , and banding will be removed in the post - bcd pipeline corrections .",
    "the effects of persistent images and cosmic rays can be avoided or greatly reduced in observations that are well dithered .",
    "we recommend taking a minimum of three images of a science target in each channel as a best practice for observing with irac .",
    "in flight , irac meets all of the science requirements which were established before launch , and in many cases the performance is better than the requirement .",
    "irac is a powerful survey instrument because of its high sensitivity , large field of view , and four - color imaging from 3.2 to 9.5 microns wavelength .",
    "for example , in channel 1 ( 3.6 @xmath0 m ) , irac can reach the same point source sensitivity ( 19 magnitude , 5@xmath6 , 1 hour ) as the w. m. keck telescope at 2.9 - 3.2 @xmath0 m in only one - hundredth the exposure time and does so with a far larger field of view : 5@xmath15   versus 40@xmath140 . in channel 4 ( 8.0 @xmath0 m ) , irac can achieve the ultimate sensitivity limit reached by isocam ( 15 @xmath0jy , 1@xmath6 , 1 hour , 3@xmath13   field ) on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) in the lw2 filter ( 6.7 @xmath0 m ) in approximately one - hundreth the frame time @xcite .",
