    "akaishi , myint and yamazaki ( amy ) have argued recently @xcite , using examples taken from the phenomenology of @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems , that quasibound states should not be defined by @xmath3-matrix poles on the appropriate riemann sheet within nonrelativistic coupled - channel potential models .",
    "their working example is a @xmath4 coupled channel problem , @xmath5 , in which the potential in the upper @xmath1 channel is sufficiently strong to generate on its own a bound state that becomes quasibound when the two channels are coupled to each other .",
    "[ this is a carricature of the @xmath6 @xmath1 quasibound state which is identified experimentally by observing a @xmath7 resonance shape in various reactions . ]",
    "increasing the attraction in the upper channel , amy observed that the @xmath6 pole moved to lower energies towards the @xmath7 threshold , while becoming substantially broader .",
    "this large width of the quasibound pole state is incompatible , according to amy , with the expected narrowness of the @xmath1 spectral shape near the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "instead , they suggested that kapur - peierls inspired intrinsic decaying states ( ids ) replace @xmath3-matrix pole states whenever the width of the latter exceeds some relatively small value .",
    "in this note we argue that these ids do not emerge from any proper multichannel dynamics for the @xmath1 system at low energies , and thus ids are not the correct theoretical construct to use for quasibound states .",
    "we also show , using a _ realistic _",
    "example from low - energy @xmath1 phenomenology , that the lower among the two @xmath3-matrix poles that arise naturally in chirally motivated models becomes gradulaly narrow when the strength of the @xmath1 interaction is beefed up , joining smoothly a bound state pole below the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "therefore , chirally motivated models do not exhibit the pole structure that amy were bothered by .    although the motivation of amy was apparently to discredit the relatively large widths of order 100 mev found for a @xmath8 quasibound state in coupled - channel three - body faddeev calculations by shevchenko et al .",
    "@xcite , compared to the smaller width about 60 mev found in the single - channel three - body non - faddeev calculation by yamazaki and akaishi @xcite , we chose not to enter into argument on this point .",
    "the amy paper does not report any new calculation for the @xmath8 system beyond handwaving in terms of ids , a concept that is refuted in the present note .",
    "for this reason we decided not to overdo our criticism of their work .",
    "here we sketch schematically the definitions and properties of gamow states and of kapur - peierls states , without specifying the coupled channels involved in the physics of the problem .",
    "suffice to state that our considerations hold for an effective one - channel hamiltonian @xmath9 which is energy dependent and is not necessarily hermitian .",
    "gamow states , corresponding to poles of the @xmath3 matrix , were introduced by gamow in 1928 to explain decay phenomena such as @xmath10 decay of radioactive nuclei @xcite .",
    "gamow states provide a straightforward generalization of ( normalizable ) bound states at real energies to unstable ( or quasi- ) bound states and to resonances at complex energies in terms of intrinsic properties of the system and its hamiltonian @xmath9 . denoting by @xmath11 a gamow state at a complex energy @xmath12",
    ", it satisfies @xmath13 , with a purely outgoing - wave boundary condition @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath11 is given by @xmath16 providing an exponential decay law with a lifetime @xmath17 .",
    "a unique property of gamow states is that the transition amplitude from a gamow resonant state at a complex energy @xmath18 to a scattering state of real energy @xmath19 is given by a breit - wigner ( bw ) amplitude @xmath20 resulting in a bw resonance form of the cross section @xmath21 eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) holds only in the immediate neighborhood of the gamow resonance pole , so its validity is limited to _ narrow _ resonances , and away from thresholds . to summarize , quoting from a recent reference on the properties of gamow states @xcite :  gamow states unify the concepts of resonance and decaying particle , and they provide a ` particle status ' for these concepts \" .",
    "kapur - peierls ( kp ) states were introduced in 1938 @xcite as eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath9 that are regular at @xmath22 and satisfy a purely outgoing - wave boundary condition , with a _",
    "real _ wave number corresponding to a _ given _ real incoming energy @xmath23 , at a radial distance @xmath24 outside the range of the potential .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath25 are complex , depending parametrically on the real @xmath23 .",
    "different choices of @xmath23 lead to different sets of eigenenergies \\{@xmath25}. none of these eigenenergies coincide with the pole energies of the @xmath3 matrix and , thus , @xmath25 are not related to a bw amplitude of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamp ] ) : @xmath26 we emphasize that the physical bw amplitude does not depend on the choice of @xmath24 and that its complex pole energy @xmath27 does not depend on the incoming energy @xmath23 .",
    "it is worth noting that peierls subsequent contributions to the subject of resonances hinged exclusively on gamow states @xcite . in a posthumous publication @xcite ,",
    "peierls made a comment that kp resonances  are somewhat artificial because they are defined with the boundary condition that is correct only at one energy . \"",
    "in eq .  ( [ eq : kpamp ] ) , @xmath28 is determined by a kp eigenenergy @xmath25 that depends implicitly on the input incoming real energy @xmath23 .",
    "amy sought to overcome this difficulty by replacing the energy argument @xmath29 by the real energy @xmath23 which serves in the outgoing - wave boundary condition to solve for @xmath25 .",
    "schematically , this prescription is expressed as @xmath30 it is reasonable to assume that the dominant contribution to this amplitude arises from the vicinity of the real energy @xmath23 that satisfies @xmath31 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ids ] ) essentially is how amy defined the ids , with a complex energy @xmath32 for the solution @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ids ] ) .",
    "a more rigorous definition in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath33 is given below .",
    "( here denoted @xmath34 ) plane , when the strength of the @xmath1 interaction is multiplied by a factor @xmath35 marking the points that form the trajectories .",

    "are the trajectories of a gamow resonance pole and of an ids that approximately coincide at the nominal complex energy of the @xmath6 , for a standard choice of @xmath5 coupled - channel yamaguchi separable interactions .",
    "these states , for this choice , are located in the fourth quadrant of the complex energy plane corresponding to the [ @xmath36 sheet , where the signs are those of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the relevant portion of this quadrant is bounded from above by the real energy axis from the @xmath7 threshold up to the @xmath1 threshold , about 100 mev higher .",
    "the gamow state appears as a quasibound state in the @xmath1 channel and as a bw resonance in the @xmath39 channel .",
    "when the @xmath1 interaction strength is scaled up by a multiplicative factor @xmath35 ( marked along the curves in the figure ) from the value @xmath40 it assumes for the @xmath6 , this gamow pole moves away from the real energy axis and its width increases .",
    "in contrast , the width of the ids hardly increases upon applying the scaling factor @xmath35 and ultimately it goes down to zero at the @xmath39 threshold , joining there smoothly with a bound state pole ( bound with respect to both thresholds ) .",
    "however , as shown below , this is not a consequence of the coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "it only reflects , as one approaches the @xmath7 threshold , the weakening of the imaginary part of the effective single - channel @xmath1 hamiltonian used to determine @xmath41 .",
    "it accounts for phase space , not for the dynamics .    in the @xmath42 coupled - channel framework discussed by amy ,",
    "the schrdinger equation is written , using feshbach s projection operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the coupled - channel hamiltonian .",
    "projecting out the @xmath44 space , one obtains an effective , energy dependent hamiltonian @xmath47 for @xmath48 ( identified with the @xmath1 wavefunction ) : @xmath49 and similarly an effective , energy dependent @xmath50 for @xmath51 ( identified with the @xmath7 wavefunction ) : @xmath52 note that these effective hamiltonians are not necessarily hermitian .",
    "the gamow resonance states in the [ @xmath36 sheet of the complex energy plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : amy08 ] are eigenstates of the coupled channel hamiltonian system eq .",
    "( [ eq : cc ] ) and are also eigenstates of each one of the channel hamiltonians : @xmath53 with a common eigenenergy @xmath18 and with @xmath48 and @xmath51 satisfying each an outgoing - wave boundary condition .    the operational definition of ids , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ids ] ) , was done in terms of a projection onto the @xmath43 channel only .",
    "it is easily shown to be equivalent to the following , general definition : @xmath54 in order to retain a meaning in a coupled - channel formulation , an extension onto the @xmath44 space is required , which amy hardly discussed .",
    "a sensible extension in the spirit of the underlying kp philosophy is to require @xmath55 however , since @xmath56 is sought between the two thresholds , the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hqids ] ) is _ real _ and for the yamaguchi - type separable potentials used by amy the resultant eigenenergy @xmath41 ( if any ) is also real , differing from the complex value satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpids ] ) .",
    "this argument demonstrates that the ids concept can not be extended satisfactorily from one channel to include all the relevant channels in the coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "ids , therefore , are not a property of the coupled - channel hamiltonian , nor of the @xmath3 matrix that determines the physical spectral shapes and cross sections .",
    "modern chirally motivated coupled - channel models give rise to _ two _ gamow states that dominate low - energy @xmath1 dynamics . for a recent review , see ref .",
    "one state corresponding to an @xmath57 @xmath1 quasibound state is generated dynamically from the strongly attractive interaction in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "however , this state can not be identified with the @xmath6 .",
    "the other gamow state , on the same riemann sheet , originates from a resonance in the @xmath7 channel and it corresponds to the physical @xmath6 . here",
    "we would like to follow the movement of these two poles in the complex energy plane upon changing the strength of the interaction in a chirally motivated coupled - channel model developed recently by one of us @xcite .    ]",

    "the model consists of 10 coupled channels , made out of the two - body systems @xmath60 with zero total charge .",
    "it fits well all the low - energy @xmath59 scattering and reaction data except for the perennially irreproducible @xmath61 atomic width , and it reproduces reasonably well the @xmath39 spectrum shape which is identified with the @xmath6 resonance . to be specific",
    ", we use the parameter set that gives @xmath62 mev ( see table 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . other parameter sets that fit the data",
    "equally well produce similar trends to that discussed below .",
    "the model yields two gamow poles in the fourth quadrant of the [ @xmath36 riemann sheet , with composition dominated by @xmath39 and @xmath1 channels .",
    "these pole positions , at @xmath63 ( in mev ) , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] together with the trajectories followed by these poles upon multiplying the @xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) interactions by a scaling factor as indicated in the upper ( lower ) part .",
    "the @xmath6 resonance corresponds to the lower pole at @xmath64 mev .",
    "the upper pole appears in this model above the @xmath1 threshold , as it does in other models ( see fig .",
    "8 in ref .",
    "@xcite for a compilation of results from various chiral models ) , and it is more likely to be associated with @xmath0 quasibound states in nuclei . fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] shows that this upper pole reacts differently to scaling of various pieces of the interactions : increasing the strength of the @xmath1 interactions , it drifts to lower energies below the @xmath1 threshold while becoming very broad , whereas increasing the strength of the @xmath39 interactions , it remains above the @xmath1 threshold and its width becomes vanishingly small .",
    "in contrast , the lower pole drifts to lower energies , approaching the real axis , and for a sufficiently strong coupling it forms a bound state below the @xmath39 threshold .",
    "a similar dependence of pole positions on scaling factors was observed in a recent study of gamow states within a simplified model used to test phenomenological methods of extracting resonance parameters in meson - nucleon reactions @xcite . while this study presents the behavior of resonance poles in a more general context , here we employed a realistic multichannel model that is based on chiral dynamics .",
    "we conclude that gamow states associated with low - energy @xmath1 phenomenology display a more subtle pattern than the classification made by amy .",
    "in this brief note we argued against the applicability of the ids concept introduced by amy to describe low - energy @xmath1 dynamics .",
    "gamow resonance states and gamow quasibound states , associated with gamow poles , are the only quantum states that provide a proper generalization of normalizable bound states .",

    "gamow states are independent of any reaction mechanism by which one seeks to establish such resonances or quasibound states .",
