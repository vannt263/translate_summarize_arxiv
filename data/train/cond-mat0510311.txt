    "orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0 has always been associated with the jahn - teller instability of the system as a result of the degeneracy of the @xmath1 orbits . because of the crystal field due to the oxygen octahedron",
    "the @xmath6 orbits are known , from a local picture , to lie lower in energy than the @xmath1 ones .",
    "the @xmath6 orbits are occupied each by one electron and because of strong intraatomic hund exchange interaction the spins of these electrons are aligned parallel forming a @xmath7 spin which is sometimes treated as a classical spin in model calculations . in lamno@xmath0",
    "there is one more electron that occupies an @xmath1 orbit . because the two @xmath8 orbits are degenerate the system is unstable towards a distortion which would lift the degeneracy .",
    "the amount by which the system is distorted is then determined by the competition between the gain in the electronic energy and the increase in the elastic energy of the lattice due to distortion .",
    "lamno@xmath0 is found in the distorted phase below 780k .",
    "orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0 has been observed by resonant x - ray scattering on the mn - k edge .",
    "it was found that this ordering decreases above the nel temperature 140k and disappears above t=780k concomitant with a structural phase transition@xcite .    in 3d transition metal compounds with orbital degeneracy",
    "two scenarios are invoked to explain orbital ordering . on the one hand",
    "there is superexchange interaction between orbitals on different sites .",
    "this involves virtual transfer of electrons and strong on - site electron - electron interaction .",
    "on the other hand cooperative jt distortions or electron - lattice interaction leads to splitting of the degenerate orbits and thus to orbital ordering .",
    "although the ground state ordering of lamno@xmath0 can be explained by both mechanisms it is not easy to say which is the dominant contribution .",
    "this question may sound of little importance so far as lamno@xmath0 is concerned but it is important to know the answer because whichever is the dominating mechanism will remain more or less active once the system is doped . in which case the two mechanisms , _",
    "i.e. _ , electron - lattice interactions or electron - electron correlations may lead to different physics for the doped systems .",
    "there have been attempts , by using model calculation , at explaining how orbital ordering can occur if one assumed an antiferromagnetic spin ordering @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned above , temperatures at which the orbital ordering sets in are much higher than the nel temperature of a - af spin ordering .",
    "orbital ordering can not , therefore , be attributed to spin ordering . in previous lsd @xcite and model hf @xcite calculations",
    "it is found that inclusion of distortions is necessary to recover the correct a - af and insulating character of lamno@xmath0 in the ground state .",
    "the cubic system was found to be both metallic and ferromagnetic in the lsd calculations . by using self - interaction correction ( sic ) to the lsd",
    "we can allow for the @xmath6 orbitals to localise and form low lying semi - core manifold well below the @xmath1 orbits @xcite .",
    "we then can compare total energies for different scenarios corresponding to localising a particular @xmath1 orbit . by doing",
    "so one breaks the cubic symmetry but this is allowed if the resulting ground state is lower in energy . as a result of the orbital ordering the system will distort in order to reduce the electrostatic energy due to the interaction of the oxygen electronic clouds with the lobes of the @xmath8 orbit , that is directed to them , on neighbouring mn ions .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have considered three types of spin order .",
    "ferromagetism and a type antiferromagnetism where the spins are parallel in the x - y planes and the planes are stacked antiparallel up the z axis and g type antiferromagnetism where each spin is antiparallel to all its neighbours .",
    "the difference in energy between the fm and a - afm magnetic orderings in the two cases is also very small which is consistent with the fact that inter - plane af exchange is much smaller than in - plane fm exchange in agreement with experiments .",
    "experimental exchange integrals are obtained from fitting neutron scattering results ( spin wave dispersion ) to a simple heisenberg hamiltonian with two exchange integrals acting between nearest neighbours .",
    "we calculated the exchange constants using the convention of ref @xcite : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the energies of the fm , a - afm and g - afm respectively .",
    "we assumed the value of @xmath12 for the magnetic moment on mn ions for all the orderings .",
    "the results are given , in table [ tab2 ] , for different orbital ordering ( oo ) scenarios of the @xmath1 orbits as given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "experimentally the two exchange integrals are found to be @xmath13mev and @xmath14mev for the in - plane and inter - plane coupling respectively @xcite .",
    "we see then that our calculation overestimates the tendency to in - plane ferromagnetism whereas the interplane exchange is marginally underestimated .",
    "however it was found in lda calculations @xcite that the first neighbour exchange integrals depend dramatically on lattice distortions .",
    "this might explain why our exchange constants calculated for the cubic lattice are quantitatively different from the experimental ones which were determined for the distorted lattice .",
    "our results are however in disagreement with recent model calculations of sikora and ole @xcite who found that for an ordering of `` @xmath15 , often assumed for lamno@xmath0 , '' the exchange constants `` are never close to the experiment '' .",
    "their calculated constants are both ferromagnetic which contradicts the experimental fact that lamno@xmath0 is an a - type antiferromagnet .",
    "hence their argument that @xmath16 should in fact be different from the assumed @xmath17 .",
    "the widely used goodenough - kanamori ( g - k ) rules @xcite give an indication of which exchange interactions should be positive ( ferromagnetic ) and which negative ( antiferromagnetic ) depending on the state of ionisation of the two ions , the occupied orbitals and the angle subtended at the bridging ion .",
    "they are valid only for insulating states and were worked out using perturbation theory to give a general guide to the interactions although deviations are known to occur.@xcite it is useful to compare our results for this specific material with the predictions of the g - k rules because the results may be used in future to assess the reliability of the rules .",
    "we note that in the case where we have ferromagnetism and ferromagnetically aligned orbits then our results predict a metallic ground state and so in these cases the rules are not applicable .    in lamno@xmath0",
    "the mn ions are all in the same oxidation state and the mn ions and the bridging oxygen lie along a straight line in the cubic unit cell ; the bridging angle is @xmath18 .",
    "thus the only variable that is relevant to the g - k rules is the orbital order .",
    "the rules state that if nearest neighbour sites are occupied by the same orbit the interaction is negative , antiferromagnetic .",
    "the size of the effect depends directly on the overlap of the orbits e.g. if there are two orbits @xmath4 ( which have large lobes in the x direction ) separated by a lattice vector directed along x it would be larger than if , for example , the two orbits were @xmath5 but still separated by a lattice vector directed along x. this would fit nicely with the result in table [ tab2 ] that the value of @xmath19 ( exchange up the z direction ) is negative for oo @xmath4/@xmath5 and also for oo @xmath4/@xmath20 but significantly larger in the latter case where there are @xmath20 orbits arranged in columns up the z axis .",
    "the calculation of @xmath21 is more complicated@xcite because the orbits are partially occupied but is ferromagnetic for oo @xmath4/@xmath5.@xcite the overlaps would be smaller in the x - y plane for the case oo @xmath4/@xmath20 than for oo @xmath4/@xmath5 so application of the g - k rules would predict a larger value of @xmath21 ( exchange in the x - y plane ) in the former case in agreement with first principles results .",
    "the signs of @xmath21 and @xmath19 in table [ tab2 ] do agree with the g - k rules .",
    "there is one detail in which the first principles results do deviate from the g - k rules and that is in the case antiferromagnetic ordering with the ferromagnetic orbital order f @xmath20 . in this case",
    "since all the orbits are the same all the nearest neighbour interactions should be antiferromagnetic which would mean that the g - af state should be more favourable than the a - af state whereas the opposite order is seen in table [ tab1 ] and the value for @xmath21 in table [ tab2 ] should be negative for this orbit .",
    "the order is correct for the other ferromagnetic orbital order , f @xmath22 .",
    "thus we see the predictions for the signs of @xmath21 and @xmath19 from the first principles calculation and the g - k rules agree in all cases ( except the one mentioned for f @xmath20 orbit above ) and the magnitudes agree .",
    "in one case we see that there is a disagreement on the ordering of unfavourable states .",
    "model perturbation calculations of the exchange constants also disagree with the g - k rules : as mentioned earlier , sikora and ole @xcite have found that for the case of @xmath15 the constants are small and both ferromagnetic , whereas g - k rules predict that j@xmath23 is strongly ferromagnetic while @xmath19 is antiferromagnetic .    in the ferromagnetic case the total moment is @xmath24 which is the value one expects from having four @xmath25 electrons .",
    "this is the case also because the fm solution is either half - metallic ( oo scenarios @xmath20 and @xmath22 of table [ tab1 ] ) or insulating ( oo scenarios @xmath4/@xmath5 , @xmath2/@xmath3 and @xmath4/@xmath20 of table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic moment that is on the mn ion can be less than this because of hybridiation .",
    "the magnetic moment on the mn ion when one @xmath1 orbit is localised is about 3.70@xmath26 in both fm and a - afm solutions and of 3.60@xmath26 in the g - afm case .",
    "because of hybridisation with the oxygen part of the polarisation is sitting on the oxygen ion",
    ".    the system is insulating in both orbital ordering scenarios independently of the magnetic ordering .",
    "inspection of the total density of states ( dos ) in the lowest energy @xmath2/@xmath3 ordering scenario presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a - afm ) , [ fig2](fm ) and [ fig3](g - agm ) reveals the presence of a gap which is larger as more nearest neighbour spins become antiferromagnetic ( see also table [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "its calculated value in the @xmath4/@xmath5 orbital and afm magnetic orderings is in very good agreement with the experimental optical gap @xcite as can be seen in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the peak at about -0.75ry in the total dos corresponds to the localised 3@xmath6 and one @xmath1 orbits .",
    "the latter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we can see the following features in the majority spin channel : the peak at -0.75ry representing the localised @xmath3 states and the @xmath4 states split into occupied states which hybridize strongly with the oxygen @xmath27 states and unoccupied @xmath4 states .",
    "one can also notice by looking at the minority @xmath1 states that both orbits are degenerate because these are not corrected for by the sic and hence are solutions of the lsd potential which are orthogonal to the sic states .",
    "in the lsd calculation the @xmath6 and @xmath1 states lie near the fermi level with the @xmath6 states somewhat more localised than the @xmath1 ones .",
    "however the lsd does not describe their localisation accurately . in the sic they are pushed well below the valence band , composed mostly of oxygen @xmath27 states .",
    "it is however known that the position of the si - corrected levels does not correspond to what would be seen in experiment .",
    "relaxation effects need to be considered if one wanted to get spectra from sic single particle energies @xcite .",
    "centred around -1.25ry are the oxygen @xmath28 and la @xmath29 semi - core levels .     &",
    "@xmath4/@xmath5 & @xmath2/@xmath3 &",
    "exp + fm & 0.54 & 0.27 & + a - afm & 1.09 & 1.29 & 1.1 + g - afm & 1.50 & 1.56 & +    the total energy of the solution where only @xmath6 orbits are localised and the @xmath1 electron is delocalised lies much higher than the most unfavourable orbital ordering solution which confirms that there is strong tendency to the localisation of the @xmath1 electron in lamno@xmath0 even in the cubic phase .",
    "the energy scale of the localisation / delocalisation of the @xmath1 electron is indeed at least twice as big as the energy corresponding to ordering the orbits .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with the experimental observation that even above the critical temperature of the orbital ordering local distortions remain .",
    "local distortions are an indication that there is localisation .",
    "once these @xmath1 electrons are localised they induce local distortions through the interactions with the surrounding oxygens and these distortions order simultaneously with the orbits when the temperature is lowered .",
    "although we can not with the current method simulate real paramagnetism as being a collection of disordered local moments without long range ordering we can speculate however , since the orbital ordering is so strong and independent of the spin ordering , that orbital ordering occurs in the paramagnetic state too .",
    "it is this orbital ordering which drives magnetic ordering and not the other way round . in a model calculation of paramagnetic lamno@xmath0 and kcuf@xmath0 based on an lda+u electronic structure medvedeva _",
    "_ @xcite concluded that distortions were not needed to stabilise the orbitally ordered phase in both compounds and that this ordering is of purely electronic origin .",
    "their calculations for cubic lamno@xmath0 have found that in the pm phase the orbits order but they are not pure local @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "they found that the local @xmath20 has an occupancy of 0.81 and the local @xmath22 has an occupancy of 0.21 .",
    "this is consistent with our present calculations in that the calculated ground state is nearly degenerate .    in earlier lda+u calculations",
    "@xcite on kcuf@xmath0 it was found that within lda there was no instability of the system against distortion while in lda+u the energy has a minimum for a finite distortion of the lattice .",
    "it was concluded then that electron - phonon and exchange only are not enough to drive the collective distortion .",
    "a similar view was supported also by model calculations @xcite where both electron - electron and electron - lattice interaction are taken into account . in our present calculation the competition is rather in terms of localisation / delocalisation of the @xmath1 orbits by electronic interactions alone .",
    "and we found indeed that these are enough to first localise the orbits ( larger energy scale ) and then to order them in an anti - ferromagnetic way(smaller energy scale ) .",
    "based on these results and those mentioned earlier we speculate that the distortions are a consequence of the displacement of oxygen ions to accommodate the electrostatic interactions resulting from the orbital ordering but these are crucial in selecting the ground state ordering out of the two nearly degenerate solutions we found for the cubic case .",
    "earlier sic - lsd calculations by tyer _",
    "_ @xcite have described correctly the physics of the distorted lamno@xmath0 .",
    "then banach and temmerman @xcite studied the cubic phase but using a unit cell of two formula units only .",
    "this limited the study to the first two rows and first four columns of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "hence they found that the lowest energy solution is the a - afm with @xmath20 orbital ordering . upon decreasing the lattice parameter they found a crossover to the fm with @xmath6 orbitals si -",
    "corrected only which means suppression of orbital ordering .",
    "we reconsidered this case below with our present bigger cell .",
    "@xcite studied structural and electronic properties of lamno@xmath0 under pressure and found that the system is still insulating even at higher pressure than the critical one at which the structural transition takes place .",
    "there was no indication of the magnetic state of the system but the experiments were carried out at room temperature which is well above the ordering temperature at least of the distorted lamno@xmath0 .",
    "we found both fm and a - afm solutions to be insulating in both @xmath4/@xmath5 and @xmath2/@xmath3 orbital ordered states . whereas the system is metallic when only the @xmath6 electrons are localised .",
    "the fact that the system was found to be insulating after suppression of the jt distortion is indicative of the presence of orbital ordering with or without spin ordering .",
    "use of local probe such as exafs or pdf(pair distribution function ) would be of great help though to settle the question of whether pressure really quenches distortions at the local level .",
    "another way of suppressing the distortions is by increasing temperature as done by snchez _",
    "@xcite who studied the structural changes of lamno@xmath0 with temperature by using xanes and exafs measurements . probing the local environment of the mn ions they found no abrupt change in the signal upon crossing the structural transition temperature t@xmath30 .",
    "they described the structural phase transition as ordering of the local distortions that are thermally disordered above t@xmath30 resulting in a cubic lattice on average .",
    "this picture is quite different from the high pressure one although in both cases the distortions are apparently suppressed . in the high temperature regime orbital ordering",
    "can still be present but the long range ordering is suppressed by thermal fluctuations .",
    "consistent with our calculation that the localisation / delocalisation energy is of a larger scale than orbital ordering , i.e , the @xmath1 electrons tend to localise strongly . as a consequence",
    "the lattice is distorted locally but since the energy scale of ordering the orbits / distortions is lower they are disordered by thermal fluctuations at high temperature .",
    "we have also investigated the dependence of the orbital ordering on the volume of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "to do so we compare total energies for different lattice parameters relative to the experimental one .",
    "the latter is determined by requiring that it gives the correct experimental volume of the distorted system .",
    "we compared the energies of two scenarios : the ground state solution of the experimental volume ( @xmath2/@xmath3 orbital ordering and a - afm spin ordering ) and the fm solution with delocalised @xmath1 orbits .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "one notices that the lattice parameter corresponding to the minimum is the same in both solutions and that it is slightly smaller than the parameter obtained from the experimental volume of the distorted system . upon decreasing the volume",
    "the two curves cross a at about -5% of the experimental lattice parameter . below this value",
    "the @xmath1 electron becomes delocalised and there is no longer orbital ordering .",
    "the system becomes metallic too as was signalled by the jump in the conductivity found by loa",
    "we have investigated orbital ordering in cubic lamno@xmath0 using the sic - lsd method which allows to study the localisation - delocalisation competition of correlated electrons . although orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0 has been ascribed to jahn - teller distortions of the mno@xmath31 octahedra we found that this ordering can happen from purely electronic effects by spontaneous breaking of the cubic symmetry .",
    "once the orbital ordering sets in the electrostatic interaction between the o ions and the electrons on the neighbouring mn ions can be minimised by elongating the bonds along the lobes of the occupied @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "it seems though that this coupling to the lattice is still needed to select the correct orbital ordering giving the observed distortions in the real lamno@xmath0 system .",
    "there is therefore no need to assume an underlying a - afm magnetic ordering to recover the orbital ordering .",
    "the latter is independent of the magnetic ordering and this is evidenced by the much higher ordering temperature of the orbits as compared to the spins .",
    "although what we have found is that the lattice is important to determine the symmetry of the ground state orbital ordering .",
