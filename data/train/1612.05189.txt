    "understanding the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has major implications for a variety of astrophysical problems .",
    "the imf plays a central role in converting the observed properties of galaxies ( e.g. , luminosity and color ) into physically meaningful quantities like stellar mass and star - formation rate .",
    "an assumed universality of the imf has contributed to our current observational - based paradigm of how galaxies formed and evolved throughout the history of the universe , what fraction of the universe s mass is tied up in stellar baryons , and the number of compact objects in the universe .",
    "a clear understanding of the form and universality of the imf in external galaxies is therefore a central goal in modern astrophysics ( see , e.g. , bastian  2010 for a review ) .    in recent years",
    ", there has been mounting evidence indicating that the stellar imfs for elliptical galaxies vary with galaxy mass .",
    "for example ,",
    "cappellari  ( 2012 ) used detailed dynamical models and two - dimensional stellar kinematic maps of 260 early - type galaxies from the atlas@xmath8 project to show that the mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath9 ) for elliptical galaxies increase with increasing stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath10 , consistent with a scenario where the imf changes with galaxy mass .",
    "such a finding has been independently noted in galaxy lensing measurements of @xmath9 for a variety of @xmath10 ( e.g. , auger  2010 ; treu  2010 ) .",
    "specifically , these findings indicate that relatively low - mass , early - type galaxies ( ) have @xmath9 values consistent with standard milky way - like imfs ( kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) . however , relatively massive ellipticals ( ) have mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath9 ) that are larger than those predicted from standard imfs , and can be consistent with either `` bottom - heavy '' imfs ( , yielding more low - mass stars with higher @xmath9 ) or `` top - heavy '' imfs ( , yielding more remnants with lower luminosities ; cappellari et al .",

    "van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ) and conroy & van  dokkum ( 2012 ) showed that the spectra of massive ellipticals have strong na  i and ca  ii absorption features that are indicative of a large population of very low - mass stars ( @xmath140.3  ; saglia et al .",
    "2002 ) , favoring the bottom - heavy imf interpretation for these galaxies .",
    "these features had been known for quite some time ( see , e.g. hardy & couture 1988 ; cenarro  2003 ) , but higher - quality data and spectral stellar synthesis modeling in recent years has given more confidence to the interpretation that the stellar imfs in these galaxies are likely to be bottom - heavy and consistent with @xmath15 .    despite the above evidence for a bottom - heavy imf in massive ellipticals , some inconsistencies remain .",
    "for example , smith and lucey ( 2013 ) , found that a bottom - heavy imf is incompatible with the stellar mass obtained via strong lensing , for a ( @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 ) galaxy .",
    "smith ( 2014 ) has also shown , intriguingly , that there is no correlation between results based on near - ir indices and on dynamics , on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "additionally , weidner  ( 2013 ) showed that a time - invariant and bottom - heavy imf was incompatible with the observed chemical enrichment of massive ellipticals , and underpredicted the number of stellar remnants ( in the form of lmxbs ) observed in globular clusters ( gcs ) . to resolve this",
    ", they proposed a time - dependent imf model that would evolve from a top - heavy to bottom - heavy form . in this scenario ,",
    "the star - formation histories of massive ellipticals would have included early phases of intense starburst activity that produced many massive stars ( and a top - heavy imf ) , which chemically enriched the galaxies and created turbulence in their interstellar mediums .",
    "subsequent star formation within these environments would be more greatly fragmented and lead to the formation of preferentially smaller stars and bottom - heavy imfs .    other authors have taken somewhat different approaches to resolving the above incompatibility issue .",
    "ferreras  ( 2015 ) focused on the functional form of the imf and tested a model where the low - mass and high - mass slopes of a broken power law imf were independently varied .",
    "they found that regardless of the imf slope parameters , a time - independent imf ( independent of galaxy mass ) could not simultaneously reproduce the observed chemical enrichment and gravity sensitive spectral features in massive ellipticals .",
    "finally , martn - navarro  ( 2014 ) explored a radial and time - dependent form of the imf .",
    "they argued that in massive ellipticals ( @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 ) , the radial trends in chemical enrichment and gravity sensitive spectral features could be well described by a time - dependent imf , like that proposed by weidner  ( 2013 ) , in the central regions of these galaxies .",
    "in contrast , a milky way - like imf was proposed in the galactic outskirts , based on the lack of these spectral signatures relative to the galactic interior .",
    "the imf was then claimed to be a local phenomenon , reflecting a two - stage formation history for these galaxies .",
    "other evidence for radial trends in spectral features follows similar rationales ( la  barbera  2016a , 2016b ) .",
    "the studies above have helped to constrain variations in the low - mass end of the elliptical - galaxy imf ( @xmath140.5  ) with galaxy mass but do not place strong constraints on variations of the high - mass end of the imf . to trace the high - mass end of",
    "the imf requires studying the most massive stars in a galaxy , however these stars evolve quickly into black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( nss ) making them difficult to observe .",
    "fortunately these stellar remnants are found in binary star systems , where a lower - mass and longer - lived companion star eventually becomes a `` donor '' star , losing mass to the compact object .",
    "the system itself radiates nearly all of its energy in the form of x - rays , making these previously undetectable high - mass remnants available to direct observation .",
    "therefore , an efficient and effective way to constrain variations in the high - mass end of the imf ( @xmath188  ) with galaxy mass is to test for corresponding variations in the prevalence of these low - mass  binary ( lmxb ) systems in elliptical galaxies . with this in mind ,",
    "peacock  ( 2014 ; hereafter , ) calculated ( using maraston ( 2005 ) population synthesis calculations ) that a bottom - heavy single power - law imf , with @xmath19 , would yield a factor of times fewer lmxbs per unit @xmath2-bandluminosity ( @xmath3 ) over a standard kroupa  ( 2001 ) imf , implying a dramatic decline in @xmath3 with increasing @xmath10 . using archival _ chandra x - ray observatory _",

    "we are able to place robust constraints on how @xmath3 varies across the full range of velocity dispersion ( @xmath21  80300  km  s@xmath17 ) where significant variations in @xmath3 are plausibly expected .",
    "our low - mass elliptical galaxy sample was derived from the samples of halliday ( 2001 ) and cappellari  ( 2006 ) , which contain velocity dispersion data for several nearby ellipticals .",
    "we limited our sample to galaxies with @xmath22  mpc , so that we could easily resolve lmxb populations , and @xmath23  km  s@xmath17 , to focus on the galaxies that are likely to have standard imfs that differ from the already well - studied high - mass ellipticals . in order to guard against potential contamination from young high - mass  binaries ( hmxbs ) , we further restricted our sample to galaxies that had negligible star - formation rate signatures ( sfr < 0.001  yr@xmath17 ) , as measured by 24@xmath24 m data ( temi  2009 ) . our final sample of six low - mass elliptical galaxies is summarized in table  1 .",
    "we conducted new  observations for four of the six galaxies to reach 0.57  kev point - source detection limits of @xmath25 erg  s@xmath17 ( chosen for consistency with the sample from ) , after combining with archival  data .",
    "all observations were conducted using acis - s , which covers the entire @xmath2-band - defined areal footprints of all of the galaxies in our sample ( see table  1 and jarrett  2003 ) .",
    "the only exception was ngc 4339 , which only had partial @xmath11 coverage .",
    "for this galaxy , we utilized only the background - subtracted @xmath2-band flux within the overlapping @xmath11 footprint , and only lmxbs detected in this region were included in our analyses .",
    "this resulted in our using only 74% of the @xmath2-band luminosity reported in col.(6 ) when computing @xmath3 for this galaxy .",

    "we constructed images in three  bands : 0.52  kev , 27  kev , and 0.57  kev . using our images , we utilized wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath26 to create point source catalogs .",

    "we treated the hot gas component as negligible within the small area of the sources , as these galaxies have very little diffuse emission in total , typical of low - mass ellipticals like those studied here ( e.g. , osullivan  2001 ) .",
    "our choice of photon index reproduces well the mean 27  kev to 0.52  kev count - rate ratio of the detected point sources in our sample , a value calculated using stacking analyses ( see , e.g. , lehmer  2016 for details ) .    the total number of sources within each galaxy footprint that had fluxes brighter than the @xmath28 erg  s@xmath17 limit span the range of 18 ( see col .  ( 11)(13 ) of table  1 ) .",
    "our test of the variation in the imf with galaxy mass is sensitive to the field lmxb population that forms within the galactic stellar populations . to search for potential contaminants from unrelated -detected objects , including , e.g. , background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , foreground galactic stars , central low - luminosity agn , and lmxbs formed through dynamical processes in gcs , we made use of archival  data ( col.(8 ) and ( 9 ) in table  1 ) .",

    ", it seems that the specific frequency of lmxbs indicate that the imfs of elliptical galaxies are consistent with a single `` universal '' imf .",
    "however , it is important to note that the lmxb population is tracing only the remnant population from stars with @xmath37  .",
    "all that can be reliably inferred from the apparent constancy of @xmath31 across @xmath10 , is that the single power law slope of the imf for stars of @xmath38  does not undergo strong variations for ellipticals of all velocity dispersions .",
    "in fact , it may be possible that the low - mass end does vary strongly with velocity dispersion , as found in the literature ( see references in  1 ) .    with this in mind",
    ", we sought to extend  by exploring the space of acceptable parameters that could constrain how the imf might vary , by constructing a suite of imf models and comparing their predicted @xmath31 versus @xmath10 tracks with our constraints shown in figure  1(a ) . in this process",
    ", we followed a similar , but more generalized procedure to that outlined in  4.2 of .",
    "below , we summarize our model .",
    "we began by considering a broken power - law form for an imf corresponding to high - mass ellipticals : @xmath39 where for a kroupa imf , @xmath40 = 1.3 and @xmath41 = 2.3 .",
    "@xmath42 is a constant of normalization , which , in our procedure , normalizes the 0.1100  integrated imf to 1  .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 varies with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "next , we constructed a grid of imfs over @xmath43  15 and @xmath44  13.5 with 801 and 501 steps of 0.005 , respectively , thus resulting in a grid of unique imfs . for the @xmath45 imf",
    ", we quantified the @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratio , @xmath46 , by running the stellar population synthesis code pgase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange  1997 , 1999 ) , adopting for consistency the assumption in  of a single burst star - formation history of age 10  gyr and solar metallicity . in this procedure",
    ", @xmath47 represents the total initial stellar mass and therefore does not vary with age .",
    "we defined the ratio of the @xmath45 mass - to - light ratio to that of the kroupa case as @xmath48 in order to keep @xmath49 consistent with observations of how the dynamical and stellar @xmath9 varies with @xmath10 , we required that @xmath50 ( e.g. , cappellari  2012 ; conroy  2012 ) .",
    "this requirement on @xmath49 resulted in the discarding of models with specific combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( notably , models with @xmath51 or @xmath52 were rejected ; see fig .",
    "this constraint limited the number of models considered to @xmath53 total models , which we utilize hereafter .    because the prevalence of the lmxb population is sensitive to the underlying compact object population of nss and bhs , which are remnants of @xmath54  8  stars , we calculated the number of stars per solar mass that become compact objects for a given imf by integrating the imf from 8100  : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath45 normalization factor .",
    "these mass fractions allow us to compute the @xmath2-band luminosity normalized ratio of expected nss and bhs generated by the @xmath57 imf to that of a kroupa imf by , @xmath58 from these quantities , we construct a variable imf model that varies smoothly with @xmath10 , bridging the low - mass ellipticals kroupa imf to the high - mass ellipticals imf ( i.e. , the @xmath45 imf ) .",

    "we combine equations  ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) and define a composite function : @xmath65 & = 1 - \\left ( 1 - r_{\\textup{co},i } \\right)f(\\sigma ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] which represents the @xmath10-dependent number of compact objects per unit @xmath2-band luminosity compared to the kroupa imf .",
    "we then arrive at a function that can be used to predict the number of observed lmxbs per unit @xmath2-band light :    @xmath66    here @xmath67 represents the luminosity - dependent fraction of the compact object population that is actively involved in an lmxb phase , derived using the @xmath45 model .",

    "we note that we assume that @xmath70 is independent of @xmath10 , which simplifies the computation of our imf models , but may not be physically accurate .",
    "a more detailed treatment requires  binary population synthesis modeling for various imfs ( e.g. , fragos  2013 ) , that would involve variations in the mass ratio distribution with imf . however , such treatments are likely to introduce many parameters into the analysis for which there are no plausible physical models for varying binarity , and for which there are no solid empirical constraints , making the benefit of such modeling inconclusive .",

    "presently , we have limited information about very high - redshift grbs , and almost no information about very high - redshift supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the information that exists suggests a grb rate not easily explained by detectable star forming galaxies ( tanvir et al . 2012 ) , but the present results are easily explained by having most of the star formation take place in relatively small galaxies , below the  detection threshold .",
    "we would expect similar increases in the rates of double neutron star mergers producing short grbs and gravitational wave sources , as well as an enhancement , albeit a somewhat lower one , of the rate of type ia sne , since more white dwarfs would be produced and they would be skewed more heavily toward the massive end of the white dwarf spectrum .",
    "it is also important to note that if the slope of the high - mass end of the imf changes by about 0.1 dex , then the ratio of core collapse supernovae from @xmath7740  stars to that from @xmath778  stars changes by a factor of about 20% .",
    "the yields from the most massive core collapse supernovae to those from the least massive ones can vary quite dramatically ( e.g. kobayashi  2006 ) . as a result",
    ", interstellar medium abundances may provide a complementary test of the imf . because additional metal enrichment comes from thermonuclear supernovae , classical novae , and mass loss , a detailed treatment of this problem",
    "must be undertaken before a clear prediction can be made .",
    "future  and high - resolution optical observations , and new population synthesis analyses could substantially improve constraints on the imf variation with velocity dispersion .",
    "in particular , new  and observations of low  to  intermediate mass ellipticals would be helpful in ruling - out a scenario where the high - mass end of the imf is constant across all @xmath10 .",
    "deeper  observations of the low - mass galaxies in this study would have a similar effect , allowing us to probe to the more numerous population of low - luminosity lmxbs . in a forthcoming paper , peacock ( in - prep ) , will be examining the @xmath97  field lmxb population in low - mass elliptical ngc  7457 and comparing it with similar binaries detected in deep observations of massive ellipticals .",
    "most effectively testing the variations of the imf in elliptical galaxies will require simultaneous modeling of near - ir spectroscopic data along with lmxb constraints using the combination of stellar population synthesis and  binary population synthesis modeling ( e.g. , fragos  2013 ; madau & fragos  2016 ) , in which the imf , stellar ages , metallicities , and other physical parameters that influence  binary formation are all modeled self - consistently .",
    "such a population synthesis framework will be an important future step for advancing our knowledge of how the imf varies among elliptical galaxies .",
    "additionally , a further understanding of the details of the stellar populations in the near - ir must be developed to ensure that the claims of a bottom - heavy imf are reliable . at the present time ,",
    "stellar evolution codes used for these purposes have limited or no treatment of unusual classes of stars such as interacting binaries and the products of binary interactions .",
    "such stars are likely to be relatively unimportant for tracing out the optical bands where the models have been best calibrated , however , given that the largest radius stars are most likely to interact , these stars may be increasingly important toward the reddest parts of the spectral energy distribution where red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars are most important .",
    "for instance , it has already been shown that the s - type stars might appear with different frequencies in larger and smaller elliptical galaxies , and can potentially mimic the effects of bottom - heavy imfs on the wing - ford band and the na  i d line , although not on ca  ii ( maccarone 2014 ) .    given the coincidence needed between changes in both the high- and low - mass ends of the imf to reproduce the results we see here , as well as the subtlety of the features that have been used to suggest the bottom - heavy imf , more work to investigate further the level of systematic effects from stars not included in standard stellar population synthesis models would be well - motivated .",
