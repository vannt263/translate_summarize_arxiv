    "the rate and the spectral and spatial characteristics of the spontaneous decay of an atom depend on the properties of the atom and of the radiation field , and on the interaction between them .",
    "the radiation field changes by the presence of other matter @xcite .",
    "one can try and manipulate the emission properties once the influence of this medium is understood .    in quantum optics of linear dielectrics ,",
    "one tries to describe the material medium in an effective way with the help of the classical dielectric function @xmath0 , which in general is a complex function of both position and frequency and in this full generality describes the propagation and loss of light at each point in the dielectric . sometimes it is possible to neglect the spatial variations ( including local field effects ) , dispersion and losses altogether . the spontaneous emission rate of an atom in such a simple dielectric is the refractive index @xmath1 of the medium times the rate @xmath2 in vacuum @xcite  @xcite .    the situation becomes more complicated when material dispersion has to be taken into account @xcite  @xcite . since the kramers - kronig relations tell that dispersion and loss always come together ( be it not always at the same frequencies ) , one should like to include losses as well in order to describe all frequencies in one theory .",
    "the damped polariton model @xcite  @xcite provides us with such a microscopic theory .",
    "from that theory it was shown that the radiative spontaneous emission rate equals @xmath2 times the real part of the refractive index at the transition frequency @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical treatment of dissipative systems is more complicated than the classical one , because of the extra requirement that equal - time commutation relations do not change over time @xcite .",
    "based on the damped - polariton model and on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , phenomenological quantization theories were constructed that meet these requirements . in these theories , the dielectric function is an input function and the maxwell field operators satisfy quantum langevin equations with both loss and quantum noise terms @xcite . with the use of a green - function approach ,",
    "the phenomenological quantization theories have been generalized to inhomogeneous dielectrics , first for multilayer systems and later for general @xmath0 @xcite  @xcite .",
    "field commutation relations turn out only to depend on the analytical properties of the green function .",
    "however , the calculation of spontaneous emission inside such a medium would involve the actual computation of the green function , which for general @xmath0 is not easy .",
    "a special case of the former theories is the quantum optical description of inhomogeneous systems at frequencies where both dispersion and losses can be neglected .",
    "then a description in terms of modes is possible , where the mode functions are harmonic solutions of the classical wave equation featuring a position - dependent dielectric `` constant '' @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this encompasses the now theoretically and experimentally very active research area of the so - called photonic crystals @xcite , where a periodic modulation of the refractive index at the scale of the wavelength of light can drastically modify the mode structure compared to vacuum . by increasing the refractive - index contrast ,",
    "even a photonic bandgap can open up , giving rise to a frequency interval for which waves can not travel in the crystal in any direction , so that spontaneous emission would be inhibited completely . until now , such a bandgap has not been found conclusively in the optical regime @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed to look for frequencies close to material resonances , where refractive indices can be quite substantially higher or lower than 1 @xcite .",
    "interesting new effects have been predicted for bandgap systems , such as photon - atom bound states and non - exponential spontaneous decay at the edges of the gap @xcite .",
    "a current debate is whether the weisskopf - wigner approximation can be used in the calculation of spontaneous emission near an edge of a photonic bandgap .",
    "this question seems to depend strongly on the analytic or singular behavior of the density of states at the edges of the gap , which has recently been calculated for face - centered cubic and diamond - like crystal structures @xcite .",
    "if near the edge of the bandgap a large part of the modes has a cavity - like structure , producing nonzero dwell - times near the emitting atom , then an emitted photon has a nonzero probability of being reabsorbed , which would give rabi - like oscillations of the atomic population that are missed in the weisskopf - wigner approximation .",
    "non - exponential decay can also be caused by the interference of possible decay - channels : for short times after the excitation of the atom , a larger frequency interval of the medium states plays a part in the decay process than for later times .",
    "ultimately , only the refractive index at the atomic transition frequency plays a role , all in concordance with the energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "this interference process already happens for spontaneous emission in vacuum .",
    "however , when the medium has a strong jump in the density of states around the atomic transition frequency , the interference effect will change substantially .    to separate the latter cause of non - exponential decay from the former ,",
    "it is interesting to consider the spontaneous emission inside homogeneous lossy dielectrics with strong and narrow material resonances , where the density of states can also change very rapidly . here",
    "all states correspond to simple plane wave modes , so that real reabsorption processes do not play a role . in this article , we use the damped - polariton model formulated by huttner and barnett @xcite to study the interference effects of spontaneous emission . if absorption is neglected in the damped - polariton model , then we are left with the hopfield model of a dielectric @xcite , which has a frequency bandgap inside which the refractive index is purely imaginary . the analogy between this polariton band gap system and photonic crystals was drawn in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the theory and solve its equations of motion using laplace transformations . in section [ sumrules ] we show that the consistency of our solutions depends on the validity of a number of velocity sum rules , which are then proved . in section [ longtime ] ,",
    "we find that for long times all field operators can be expressed in terms of the initial bath operators , and we give an interpretation of the result .",
    "we also show how to relate the result to phenomenological quantization theories . before we can discuss transient effects of spontaneous emission in section [ se ] , we discuss in section [ modeleps ] the lorentz oscillator model and the point scattering model .",
    "we show how both these models can be found from the damped - polariton theory by choosing a suitable coupling to the bath .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of the results and with conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "the damped - polariton theory describes the interaction of light with an absorbing homogeneous medium .",
    "the coupling of the matter to a frequency continuum is the cause of the light absorption .",
    "the continuum could be a phonon bath or something else , but for the moment that is not specified : it is a collection of harmonic oscillators with a frequency - dependent coupling to the matter fields .",
    "since the medium is homogeneous , the dynamics can be separated into a transverse and a longitudinal part . in this article",
    "we concentrate on the transverse excitations as described by the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath4 with @xmath5 \\left [ b_{\\omega}^{\\dagger}(\\lambda , { \\bf k } , t ) +   b_{\\omega}(\\lambda , -{\\bf k } , t)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{i}{2 } \\int \\mbox{d}^{3}k\\;\\hbar\\omega_{c}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tilde\\omega_{0}}{\\tilde k c } } \\left [ a(\\lambda , { \\bf k } , t ) +   a^{\\dagger}(\\lambda , -{\\bf k } , t)\\right ] \\left [ b^{\\dagger}(\\lambda , { \\bf k } , t ) -   b(\\lambda , -{\\bf k } , t ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the same notations as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 , where the frequency @xmath8 equals @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the coupling constant between field and matter , and @xmath11 the density .",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath12 of the polarization field is renormalized to @xmath13 , which is the positive - frequency solution of @xmath14 the @xmath15-integrals in the hamiltonian are understood to also denote a summation over the two transverse polarization directions labeled by @xmath16 .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators satisfy standard bosonic commutation relations .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for the bath annihilation operators are : @xmath17 -i\\omega b_{\\omega}(\\lambda , { \\bf k},t),\\ ] ] and similarly for the creation operators . in the following we drop the @xmath18-labels .",
    "we solve implicitly for the bath variables , as was done in @xcite in a classical treatment of the model : @xmath19\\;e^{-i\\omega(t- t ' ) } + b_{\\omega}(0)\\;e^{-i\\omega t}.\\ ] ] the annihilation operators are defined in terms of the ( transverse ) physical fields : @xmath20 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the vector potential and the electric field , @xmath23 the polarization field and @xmath24 its canonical conjugate .",

    "previous authors @xcite assumed that the analytical continuation of @xmath44 to negative frequencies is anti - symmetrical in frequency .",
    "then ( [ epsilon ] ) reduces to the dielectric constant in @xcite , where it was shown to be identical to the more complicated expression in @xcite .",

    "<S> the consistency of these solutions for the field and matter operators are found to depend on the validity of certain velocity sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> the transient effects in the spontaneous decay rate are studied with the help of several specific models for the dielectric constant , which are shown to follow from the general theory by adopting particular forms of the bath coupling constant .    </S>",
