    "although i have been a student of gerry , i might be the only one who never published a paper with him .",
    "in fact , my first project as a fresh grad student was to work out the @xmath0-meson coupling to the chiral bag , a hot topic in 1982 . in these days , various groups tried to develop a microscopic theory of the so successful boson - exchange models of the nuclear forces , based on bag , quark or skyrme models .",
    "i became interested in this topic through the lectures gerry gave at the 1981 erice school and he offered me to do my phd in his group .",
    "i arrived in april 1982 at stony brook and when gerry gave me this topic to work on , he said that we would finalize it in front of the fire place in the winter .",
    "well , when i handed him a first draft of the paper in august , he did not even look at it in detail , just saying : `` you are too fast for me , do your own stuff '' .",
    "so i was pretty discouraged and shelved the manuscript .",
    "i thought to publish it in these proceedings , but unfortunately it seems to have been lost over the years .",
    "therefore , in this talk i will try to give a personal recollection of gerry s understanding of the nuclear force and how it influenced modern nuclear structure calculations .",
    "clearly , i can only touch upon some issues here , topics like nuclear forces from bags or skyrmions or the @xmath1 approach are left to other speakers . also , to avoid duplication , for more personal recollections",
    "i refer to my contribution `` chiral symmetry , nuclear forces and all that '' to the festschrift in honor of his 85@xmath2 birthday , see ref .",
    "this is a condensation of the work gerry did with many collaborators over decades , so it is neither intended to be complete nor exhaustive . as a matter of fact",
    ", gerry knew all the ingredients how to model the nuclear force @xcite .",
    "these are ( i also give a few pertinent papers on these topics co - authored by gerry ) :    * _ chiral symmetry _ @xcite : + chiral symmetry fixes pion interactions to pions and matter fields and thus relates seemingly unrelated processes , like pion - nucleon scattering with the two - pion exchange potential and the leading three - nucleon force of two - pion range .",
    "gerry was one of the pioneers of exploring the consequences of chiral symmetry in nuclear physics .",
    "all this is now firmly rooted in the spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . *",
    "_ three- and four - body forces _ @xcite : + a precise description of few - nucleon systems requires three - nucleon forces ( 3nfs ) , see e.g. ref .  @xcite . as examples ,",
    "i mention the minimum in the differential cross section of low - energy neutron - deuteron scattering or the @xmath3he@xmath3h binding energy difference .",
    "four - nucleon forces ( 4nfs ) become relevant in heavier nuclei and nuclear matter , see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : latt ] . *",
    "_ two - pion exchange form pion - nucleon scattering _",
    "@xcite : + a model - independent determination of the two - pion exchange contribution to the nuclear force is possible using dispersion relations , that allow one to connect the processes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this connection was utilized in the paris  @xcite and the stony brook  @xcite potentials .",
    "the method is discussed in great detail in one of gerry s textbooks  @xcite .",
    "one central ingredient in a potential constructed along these lines is the generation of the @xmath6meson , that parameterizes the central intermediate range attraction in boson - exchange potentials , through pion rescattering . for a modern look at this problem",
    ", i refer to ref .",
    "also , there is of course a strong overlap between these issues , as e.g. three - nucleons forces are strongly constrained by chiral symmetry .",
    "in fact , one must admit that almost all the ingredients for an effective field theory ( eft ) approach were already available at the time i did my graduate studies , except for a power counting that was only formulated for multi - nucleon systems based on chiral pion - nucleon lagrangians by steve weinberg in 1990  @xcite .",
    "chiral effective field theory as originally proposed by weinberg has become a precision tool in nuclear physics .",
    "here , i only display its main ingredients without detailed discussion . for an introductory review with many references ,",
    "i refer to ref .",
    "also , i do not want to enter the issues related to the inclusion of @xmath7isobars or vector mesons or some on - going attempts to improve upon weinberg s original work , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion . in the weinberg scheme ,",
    "the power counting is applied to the few - nucleon potentials and not to the scattering amplitudes directly .",
    "the resulting contributions to the 2n , the 3n and the 4n forces are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] up - to - and - including - next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath3lo ) .",
    "first , this scheme is rather predictive .",
    "while in the 2n force , one has 2,7 and 15 low - energy constants ( lecs ) at leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and at n@xmath3lo , respectively , to be determined by a fit to data , there are only two lecs in the 3nf at n@xmath8lo and none in the 4nf .",
    "isospin breaking through the light quark mass difference and the electromagnetic force can also be included systematically and precisely in this framework .",
    "further , note that - consistent with phenomenological observations - three - nucleon forces appear only two orders after the dominant nn forces and four - nucleon forces are even further suppressed , appearing only at n@xmath3lo .",
    "contributions to the effective potential of the 2n , 3n and 4n forces based on weinberg s power counting . here , lo denotes leading order , nlo next - to - leading order and so on .",

    "the filled and open box denote two- and four - derivative operators , respectively .",
    "figure courtesy of evgeny epelbaum.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    these forces haven been successfully applied and tested in a phletora of calculations in few - nucleon calculations and are also frequently used ( within some approximations ) in many - body calculations .",
    "there are a number of challenges remaining , like e.g. the elusive @xmath9 data in nucleon - deuteron scattering , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , or more calculations of the electroweak response to light nuclei with currents consistently constructed from chiral eft , see e.g. refs .",
    "the interested reader might want to consult the reviews  @xcite .",
    "in an interesting but not much cited paper in 1987 , co - authored with herbert mther and chris engelbrecht , gerry tackled the problem of how nuclear binding depends on the number of colors , @xmath10 , and the light quark masses , @xmath11 @xcite . for that , a one - boson - exchange model with varying @xmath10 and @xmath11 was constructed . in particular , in the scalar - isoscalar central channel , the spectral function was reconstructed from two - pion exchange and represented by an effective @xmath6-meson , with mass @xmath12 and coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "nuclear binding was then calculated employing brueckner - hartree - fock methods .",
    "the conclusion was that `` our world is wedged into a small corner of the two - dimensional manifold of @xmath11 versus @xmath10 '' .",
    "it is interesting to re - analyze this question in chiral eft , which allows for a more systematic approach to possible quark mass variations . for recent works on nuclear forces at large-@xmath10",

    "the ingredients to work out the quark mass dependence of these forces can be easily understood from the lo potential shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] .",
    "first , there is an _",
    "explicit _ pion mass dependence through the pion propagator in the one- and two - pion exchanges @xmath15 and , second , there is a variety of _ implicit _ quark mass dependences through the nucleon mass , @xmath16 , the pion - nucleon coupling , @xmath17 , and the lecs accompanying the multi - nucleon operators , @xmath18 .",
    "note that because of the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , @xmath19 ( we work in the isospin limit @xmath20 ) , one can use the notions quark and pion mass dependence synonymously . to discuss the quark mass dependence of hadron properties , one introduces the so - called @xmath21-factors , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 some hadronic observable and flavor @xmath24 .",
    "the pion and nucleon properties ( masses , couplings , etc . ) can be obtained from lattice qcd data combined with chiral perturbation theory , for details see ref .",
    "@xcite . for the contact interactions ,",
    "one has to resort to modeling , using the fairly successful concept of resonance saturation of the lecs .",
    "this should eventually be overcome by corresponding lattice simulations .",
    "putting all this together , one finds for the nn s - wave scattering lengths and the deuteron binding energy ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] ) @xcite @xmath25 a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , these @xmath21-factors are of natural size .",
    "second , the sizeable uncertainties are due to the modeling of the contact terms by resonance saturation . third , as gerry told us , the nuclear forces are very sensitive to variations in the quark mass .",
    "interestingly , the deuteron appears to be stronger bound as the light quark mass decreases , consistent with the expected binding energy in the chiral limit , @xmath26mev . using the @xmath21-factors given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) combined with corresponding @xmath21-factors for light nuclei @xcite , one can deduce limits on the possible quark mass variations from the abundances of the elements generated in the big bang , @xmath27 ( in the isospin limit ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the neutron lifetime , that is sensitive to isospin - violating effects , leads to an even stronger constraint . under the sensible assumption that all lepton and quark masses vary with the vev of the higgs field @xmath28 , one finds @xmath29 @xcite , which lends some credit to anthropic considerations in nucleosynthesis",
    "there are two different venues to tackle the nuclear many - body problem , that is nuclei with atomic number @xmath30 .",
    "either one utilizes the forces from eft within a conventional , well established many - body technique ( no - core - shell - model , coupled cluster approach , etc . ) or one develops a novel scheme that combines these forces with monte carlo methods that are so successfully used in lattice qcd .",
    "this novel scheme is termed `` nuclear lattice simulations '' and has recently enjoyed wide recognition as the first ever _ ab initio _ calculation of the hoyle state in @xmath31c has been performed @xcite .",
    "space is too short for a detailed exposition of this method , so i rather make some general remarks and discuss some very recent results obtained in this framework .    in the nuclear lattice eft approach , space - time is discretized in euclidean time on a torus of volume @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the side length in spatial ( temporal ) direction .",
    "the minimal distance on the lattice , the so - called lattice spacing , is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) in space ( time ) .",
    "this entails a maximum momentum on the lattice , @xmath36 , which serves as an uv regulator of the theory .",
    "the nucleons are point - like particles residing on the lattice sites , whereas the nuclear interactions ( pion exchanges and contact terms ) are represented as insertions on the nucleon world lines using standard auxiliary field representations .",
    "the nuclear forces have an approximate spin - isospin su(4 ) symmetry ( wigner symmetry ) @xcite that is of fundamental importance in suppressing the malicious sign oscillations that plague any monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of strongly interacting fermion systems at finite density .",

    "the sensitivity of the production rate of carbon and oxygen in red giant stars to the fundamental constants of nature was investigated by considering the impact of variations in the light quark masses and the electromagnetic fine - structure constant on the reaction rate of the triple - alpha process .",
