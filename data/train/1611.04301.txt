    "an experimental realization of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on kagom lattice was long sought after as a prominent example of the geometrically frustrated spin system with a spin - liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "this fact has also stimulated particular attention to the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron , which can be alternatively viewed as zero - dimensional analogs of the kagom lattice packed on a sphere @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spin-1/2 heisenberg cuboctahedron as one of the archimedean solids has recently found an intriguing experimental realization through the high - nuclear spin cluster with a cu@xmath1la@xmath2 core @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 , spin-1 , spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 heisenberg cuboctahedron was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , while the magnetocaloric effect of the spin-1/2 and spin-1 heisenberg cuboctahedron was examined in ref .",
    "it has been evidenced that a height of the last step to the saturation magnetization is twice as large as the other magnetization steps , which can be explained by the highest possible number of localized magnons trapped on square faces @xcite .",
    "magnetic properties of the irregular spin-1/2 heisenberg cuboctahedron with a flat random distribution were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the antisymmetric dzyaloshinsky - moriya term @xcite as a possible source of the magnetic anisotropy can be generally ruled out due to an anticipated presence of the inversion center in the middle of each bond of the cuboctahedron . in this regard ,",
    "the xxz exchange anisotropy represents for the heisenberg cuboctahedron the leading - order term determining the magnetic anisotropy on assumption that a local crystal field of negatively charged ligands around each magnetic center has a unique anisotropy axis @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we will therefore examine an influence of the exchange anisotropy on a low - temperature thermodynamics of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron , which has not been dealt with yet .",
    "let us consider spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) given by the hamiltonian @xmath3 - h \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{s}_i^z , \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes spatial projections ( @xmath5 ) of the spin- 1/2 operator placed at @xmath6th vertex of the cuboctahedron , the first summation accounts for the antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath7 between the nearest - neighbor spins and @xmath8 is the anisotropy parameter in the xxz heisenberg interaction .",
    "two limiting cases @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to the ising and isotropic heisenberg models , respectively .",
    "the second summation accounts for the zeeman s energy of magnetic moments in the external magnetic field @xmath11 and finally , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the total number of spins ( bonds ) of the cuboctahedron . to obtain exact diagonalization data for the magnetization and entropy of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron",
    "we have adapted the subroutine edfulldiag from algorithms and libraries for physics simulations ( alps ) project @xcite .",
    "this approach allows a rigorous calculation of the magnetization process and magnetocaloric properties of the model under investigation , which will be the central issue of our subsequent analysis .",
    "let us start our discussion with the ground - state diagram of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "each area delimited by displayed phase boundaries corresponds to a different ground state , which is distinguished according to the corresponding value of the total magnetization normalized with respect to its saturation value . with exception of a trivial fully polarized ground state , the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron exhibits for any @xmath15 another five ground states , which should be manifested in a zero - temperature magnetization curve as intermediate plateaux at zero , one - sixth , one - third , one - half and two - thirds of the saturation magnetization .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast with much simpler behavior of the ising cuboctahedron retrieved in the limiting case @xmath16 , which exhibits in a zero - temperature magnetization process just a single one - third plateau before the magnetization reaches saturation .",
    "it is noteworthy that only the state corresponding to a five - sixths intermediate plateau is not realized as a particular ground state out of all available lowest - energy states of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron with the total spin @xmath17 , which can be attributed to the highest possible number of localized magnons trapped on two opposite square faces of the cuboctahedron ( see fig .",

    ".     plane .",
    "acronyms in round circles determine the total magnetization normalized with respect to its saturation value .",

    "[ fig3 ] three - dimensional ( 3d ) plot of the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field and anisotropy parameter @xmath18 at the sufficiently low ( @xmath19 ) and moderate ( @xmath20 ) temperatures .",
    "although there are no true magnetization plateaux and jumps at any finite temperature , the low - temperature magnetization curve displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) is strongly reminiscent of the actual magnetization plateaux and jumps observed strictly at zero temperature .",
    "moreover , it can be actually seen from fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) that only one intermediate plateau at one - third of the saturation magnetization is realized in the ising limit ( @xmath21 ) , while the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron generally exhibits for any @xmath15 another four intermediate plateaux at zero , one - sixth , one - half and two - thirds of the saturation magnetization .",
    "the novel magnetization plateaux gradually extend over a wider range of the magnetic fields with increasing of a quantum ( @xmath0 ) part of the xxz exchange interaction at the expense of the original one - third and saturation plateaux .",
    "it can be found that the one - third plateau is approximately @xmath22 narrower for the isotropic heisenberg cuboctahedron ( @xmath10 ) in comparison with the ising cuboctahedron ( @xmath9 ) . finally , it is worthwhile to remark that the five - sixths plateau is indeed absent in the magnetization curve of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron regardless of the exchange anisotropy @xcite .    for a comparison ,",
    "the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron at the moderate temperature @xmath20 is shown in fig . [ fig3](b ) .",
    "as one can see , the magnetization plateaux and jumps become gradually smoother upon rising temperature .",
    "actually , it can be found from fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) that all magnetization plateaux except one - third plateau completely disappear from the relevant magnetization curve provided that the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 is sufficiently small ( i.e. near the ising limit @xmath9 ) . on the other hand , two widest one - third and one - half magnetization plateaux",
    "can be still discerned at this temperature in the magnetization curve close to the isotropic heisenberg limit ( @xmath10 ) , while other narrower magnetization plateaux are reflected merely as less pronounced inflection points .",
    "next , let us also examine magnetocaloric properties of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron , which can be particulary interesting especially in a vicinity of the magnetization jumps .",
    "first , we will discuss the ising limiting case with @xmath9 , for which a few isentropy lines are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) in the magnetic field - temperature plane .",
    "the displayed isentropy lines can also be viewed as a temperature response with respect to varying external magnetic field during the adiabatic demagnetization .",
    "the ising cuboctahedron exhibits a giant magnetocaloric effect just above ( below ) of two magnetization jumps , where a sharp increase ( decrease ) of temperature is invoked upon lowering of the magnetic field .",
    "an absence of zero magnetization plateau in a magnetization process of the ising cuboctahedron causes a giant magnetocaloric effect in a vicinity of zero field , which makes this frustrated spin structure quite promising refrigerant enabling cooling down to absolute zero temperature quite similarly to the ising octahedron and dodecahedron @xcite .    ;",
    "( b ) @xmath23 .",
    "( color figure online),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ] ; ( b ) @xmath23 .",
    "( color figure online),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    ; ( b ) @xmath24 .",
    "( color figure online),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ] ; ( b ) @xmath24 .",
    "( color figure online),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the density plot of the entropy is displayed in fig . [ fig4](b ) for relatively low value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath23 close enough to the ising limiting case .",
    "though it is still possible to observe during the adiabatic demagnetization a steep increase ( decrease ) of temperature just below ( above ) of the magnetization jumps , the most essential difference is that the temperature shows a less marked decrease ( just down to some finite value ) near zero field due to a presence of tiny plateau with a zero magnetization .",
    "the other intermediate magnetization plateaux occur in a relatively narrow range of magnetic fields for low values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 and hence , the deviation from an anomalous magnetocaloric behavior manifest itself just at relatively low temperatures .",
    "contrary to this , the isentropy lines of the isotropic heisenberg cuboctahedron @xmath10 indicate a remarkable change of temperature in the vicinity of all magnetization steps [ see fig . [",
    "fig5](b ) ] .",
    "it is quite curious that the similar magnetocaloric behavior can be already detected in the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron with a relatively strong exchange anisotropy @xmath25 as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the temperature exhibits in both aforementioned cases a relatively steep decrease ( increase ) just above ( below ) each critical field associated with the magnetization jump . from the perspective of the cooling efficiency , the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron with the exchange anisotropy @xmath26 should be however regarded as much worse refrigerant system , because temperature finally shows a gradual increase during the adiabatic demagnetization in a close vicinity of zero magnetic field due to a presence of zero magnetization plateau .",
    "the present work deals with the magnetization process and magnetocaloric properties of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron , which have been analyzed by means of the exact diagonalization method .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the magnetization curve of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron posseses several intermediate plateaux and an anomalous magnetocaloric effect close to respective magnetization steps .",
    "while the spin-1/2 ising cuboctahedron exhibits only one intermediate plateau at one - third of its saturation value , the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron additionally exhibits other four intermediate plateaux of a quantum nature .",
    "an enhanced magnetocaloric effect has been detected in a vicinity of all magnetization steps .",
    "the magnetocaloric effect of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron at the anisotropy parameter @xmath23 behaves quite similarly as the ising limiting case @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetocaloric effect of the spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg cuboctahedron for the anisotropy parameter @xmath27 behaves quite similarly as the isotropic heisenberg case @xmath10 .    20 c. lacroix , ph .",
