    "the hubbard hamiltonian is a simple model for studying strongly interacting systems . in particular",
    "it is used to investigate the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition in half - filled systems.@xcite it is clear that for strong correlations such a system should be insulating , since in the atomic limit the states with exactly one electron per lattice site are energetically favored , while all other states are separated from those by a coulomb gap . for a generalized hubbard model with degenerate orbitals",
    "the same argument implies that for strong correlations not only the half - filled , but all integer filled systems will become mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "it is then natural to ask how the location of the transition depends on the filling .    as an example we consider a hamiltonian describing the alkali doped fullerides.@xcite it comprises the three - fold degenerate @xmath0 orbital and the coulomb interaction @xmath2 between the electrons on the same molecule . using this hamiltonian ,",
    "we have recently shown that , although @xmath2 is substantially larger than the band width @xmath3 , k@xmath4c@xmath5 is not a mott insulator but a ( strongly correlated ) metal.@xcite prompted by the synthesis of an isostructural family of doped fullerenes a@xmath6c@xmath5 with different fillings @xmath7,@xcite we now address the question of the mott transition in integer doped fullerides . for these systems we have the interesting situation that for fillings @xmath8 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 calculations in the local density approximation predict them all to be metallic,@xcite while in hartree - fock they all are insulators . performing quantum monte carlo calculations for the degenerate hubbard model at different fillings and for values of @xmath2 typical for the fullerides , we find that all the systems are close to a mott transition , with the critical correlation strength @xmath9 at which the transition takes place strongly depending on the filling @xmath7 .",
    "more generally , our results show how , for an otherwise identical hamiltonian , the location of the mott transition @xmath9 depends on the filling .",
    "@xmath9 is largest at half - filling and decreases for fillings smaller or larger than half .",
    "we contrast these findings with the results from hartree - fock calculations which predict a much too small @xmath9 and show almost no doping dependence .",
    "we give an interpretation of the results of the quantum monte carlo calculations extending the hopping argument introduced in ref .   to arbitrary integer fillings . despite the crudeness of the argument it explains the doping dependence found in quantum monte carlo .",
    "we therefore believe that our simple hopping argument captures the basic physics of the doping dependence of the mott transition in degenerate systems .    in section",

    "we introduce the many - body enhancement of the hopping matrix elements , which explains how orbital degeneracy @xmath10 helps to increase the critical @xmath2 at which the mott transition takes place and we analyze how frustration leads to an asymmetry of the critical @xmath2 for fillings @xmath7 and @xmath11 . a summary in sec .",

    "the on - site coulomb interaction is @xmath20 .",

    "it is more pronounced for fillings @xmath53 than for fillings @xmath54 .",
    "we note that the opening of the gap is accompanied by a change in the character of that trial function which yields the lowest energy in the fixed - node approximation . for small @xmath2 , where the system is still in the metallic regime , paramagnetic trial functions with small @xmath38 ( see the discussion after eqn .",
    "( [ psitrial ] ) ) are best . when the gap starts to open , trial functions with larger @xmath38 , which have antiferromagnetic character , give lower energies .",
    "the corresponding slater determinants @xmath37 describe a mott insulator in hartree - fock approximation .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results of the quantum monte carlo calculations with the predictions of hartree - fock theory .",
    "figure [ hfgap ] shows the the gap @xmath1 calculated for the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) within the hartree - fock approximation for the different integer fillings .",
    "compared with quantum monte carlo , the gap opens much too early , around @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is only a very weak doping dependence : @xmath9 somewhat increases with the filling  in qualitative disagreement with the quantum monte carlo results .",
    "this failure is a direct consequence of the mean - field approximation . in hartree - fock",
    "the only way to avoid multiple occupancies of the molecules , in order to reduce the coulomb repulsion , is to renormalize the on - site energy for the orbitals , thereby localizing the electrons in certain orbitals . for the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) this on - site energy is , apart from a trivial offset , given by @xmath57 . lowering the coulomb energy in this way will , however , increase the kinetic energy . for small changes in the on - site energies this increase will scale like the inverse of the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this suggests that the critical @xmath2 should be the larger , the smaller the density of states at the fermi level . inspecting the density of states @xmath58 for the non - interacting hamiltonian ( see e.g.  fig .  3 of ref .   )",
    ", we find that this is indeed the case : @xmath58 slightly decreases with filling , explaining the corresponding increase in @xmath9 .",
    "hence the weak , but qualitatively wrong , doping dependence in hartree - fock can be understood as an effect of the small variation in the density of states of the non - interacting system .",
    "to find a simple interpretation for the doping dependence of the mott transition we consider the limit of large coulomb interaction @xmath2 . in that limit",
    "the coulomb energy dominates and we can estimate the energies entering the gap equation ( [ eg ] ) by considering electron configurations in real space . according to the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] )",
    "the contribution to the coulomb energy from a molecule that is occupied by @xmath15 electrons is @xmath59 .",
    "thus the energy of a system with filling @xmath7 is minimized for configurations with exactly @xmath7 electrons per molecule .",
    "the hopping of an electron to a neighboring molecule would cost the coulomb energy @xmath2 and is therefore strongly suppressed in the large-@xmath2 limit .",
    "the energy for a cluster of @xmath24 molecules with @xmath25 electrons ( filling @xmath7 ) is then given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a typical hopping matrix element .",
    "adding an extra electron increases the coulomb energy by @xmath62 , removing an electron reduces it by @xmath63 .",
    "but there will also be a kinetic contribution to the energy @xmath64 , since the extra charge can hop without any additional cost in coulomb energy . to estimate the kinetic energy we calculate the matrix element for the hopping of the extra charge to a neighboring molecule .",
    "this matrix element will of course depend on the arrangement of the other @xmath10 electrons .",
    "it is well known that for the non - degenerate hubbard model a ferromagnetic arrangement of the spins is energetically favored ( nagaoka s theorem@xcite ) , allowing the extra charge to hop without disturbing the background spins . for a degenerate hubbard model , however , the hopping matrix element is larger e.g.  for an antiferromagnetic arrangement of the background spins.@xcite this is illustrated in fig .  [ hopping ]",
    "a ) for an extra electron in a system with filling 2 . now , instead of only the extra electron",
    ", any one out of the three equivalent electrons can hop to the neighboring molecule . denoting the state with the extra electron on molecule",
    "@xmath16 by @xmath65 , we find that the second moment of the hamiltonian @xmath66 is given by the number of hopping channels @xmath67 ( in the present case @xmath68 ) times the number of ( equivalent ) nearest neighbors @xmath69 times the single - electron hopping matrix element @xmath61 squared .",
    "thus by inserting the identity in the form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes the state where any one of the electrons has hopped form molecule @xmath16 to the neighboring molecule @xmath18 , we find @xmath72 i.e.  the hopping matrix element is enhanced by a factor of @xmath73 over the one - particle hopping matrix element @xmath61 . in a similar way we find for the system with an extra hole ( fig .",
    "[ hopping ] b ) a hopping enhancement of @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "the hopping enhancements for other fillings are listed in table [ enhancement ] , where @xmath75 denotes the enhancement for a system with an extra hole , and @xmath76 is for a system with an extra electron .",
    ".[enhancement ] hopping enhancement for different fillings of a 3-fold degenerate band . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a single electron the kinetic energy is of the order of @xmath77 , where @xmath3 is the one - electron band width .",
    "the enhancement factor @xmath73 in the many - body case then suggests that the kinetic energy for the extra charge is correspondingly enhanced , implying @xmath78 combining these results we find @xmath79 i.e.  the hopping enhancement leads to a reduction of the gap described by the factor @xmath80 .",
    "this reduction is largest ( @xmath81 ) for n=3 , and becomes smaller away from half - filling : @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for fillings 1 and 5 . extrapolating ( [ largeugap ] ) to intermediate @xmath2",
    "we find that the gap opens for u larger than @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the above argument predicts that the critical @xmath2 for the mott transition depends strongly on the filling , with @xmath9 being largest at half - filling and decreasing away from half - filling .",
    "this is qualitatively the same behavior as we have found in the monte carlo calculations .",
    "we note , however , that the argument we have presented is not exact .",
    "first , the hopping of an extra charge against an antiferromagnetically ordered background will leave behind a trace of flipped spins .",
    "therefore the analogy with the one - electron case for determining the kinetic energy in the large-@xmath2 limit is not exact .",
    "second , using ( [ largeugap ] ) for determining @xmath9 involves extrapolating the results obtained in the limit of large @xmath2 to intermediate values of the coulomb interaction , where the mott transition takes place . finally , considering only one nearest neighbor in the hopping argument ( cf .",
    "[ hopping ] ) implicitly assumes that we are dealing with a bipartite lattice , where all nearest neighbors are equivalent .",
    "to analyze the asymmetry in the gaps around half - filling we use the following exact relation for the kinetic energy in the limit of infinite @xmath2 , which follows from an electron - hole transformation @xmath86 ( note how this symmetry is reflected in the hopping enhancements shown in table [ enhancement ] . ) since the gap for filling @xmath7 is given by @xmath87 the asymmetry @xmath88 in the gaps can be written entirely in terms of energies for systems with an extra electron : @xmath89 for a bipartite system the spectrum for a given filling will be symmetric , in particular @xmath90 , and thus there will be no asymmetry in the gaps : @xmath91 .",
    "frustration breaks this symmetry . to study the effect of frustration",
    "we perform a lanczos calculation in the large-@xmath2 limit , starting from a configuration @xmath92 of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ hopping ] .",
    "the leading effect of frustration is given by the third moment , which already enters after the first lanczos step .",
    "diagonalizing the lanczos matrix and expressing everything in terms of the moments of the hamiltonian , the extreme eigenvalues are given by@xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the @xmath95 moment of @xmath31 , and @xmath96 for a state like in fig .",
    "[ hopping ] .",
    "from this expression it is clear that the `` band width '' @xmath97 is essentially given by the second moment , and that an enhancement of @xmath98 by a factor of @xmath67 leads to an increase in the band width by a factor of @xmath73 , as already described above .",
    "the main effect of the third moment ( i.e.  of frustration ) is to shift the extremal eigenvalues , where the shift is determined by the third moment .    to get a contribution to the third moment",
    "the initial state @xmath92 must be recovered after three hops .",
    "this is only possible if the extra charge hops around a triangle , without changing spins along its path . for a state with an extra electron",
    "this means that _ one and the same _ electron has to perform the triangular hop .",
    "therefore , even in the many - body case , for each such electron we get the same contribution to the third moment as in the single electron case .",
    "it therefore makes sense to write the third moment @xmath99 for a system with @xmath100 electrons in terms of the third moment @xmath101 of the single electron problem : @xmath102 , where @xmath103 describes the many - body effects , just like we introduced @xmath104 to describe the many - body enhancement of the second moment . using these definitions we find that the size of the asymmetry @xmath105 in the gaps can be estimated by the doping dependence of the ( positive ) enhancement factors @xmath103 of the third moment , while the overall sign is determined by the single - electron moments : @xmath106    to understand the doping dependence of @xmath107 we proceed in two steps .",
    "first we observe that the upper limit for the number of different electrons that can perform a triangular hop is given by the number @xmath76 of electrons that can hop to a nearest neighbor .",
    "hence , if frustration is not suppressed , @xmath108 . for filling @xmath109 , @xmath110 this upper limit",
    "can always be achieved without compromising large next - neighbor hopping by arranging the electrons in such a way as to avoid each other .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ tri2 ] . for the corresponding filling @xmath111 the electrons",
    "can no longer be completely separated in that way .",
    "thus the channel for triangular hops will be blocked by the the pauli principle , reducing @xmath107 . in that way for the larger fillings frustration",
    "is reduced .",
    "this reduction of frustration can already be seen in the simple model of a triangle with orbital degeneracy @xmath112 ( cf .",
    "[ tri2 ] ) .",
    "choosing matrix elements @xmath113 for hopping between like orbitals we find for filling @xmath109 a strong asymmetry @xmath114 and @xmath115 , while at filling @xmath116 there is no asymmetry in the extremal eigenvalues : @xmath117 .",
    "we note that flipping one spin in the configuration for filling @xmath118 would allow for a triangular hop . in a lanczos calculation",
    "this spin polarized configuration gives , however , only extremal eigenvalues @xmath119 and @xmath120 . the states described here for a triangle can be easily adapted to the situation in an fcc lattice , where the third moment involves hopping to the nearest neighbor sites , which form connected triangles .    from the non - interacting density of states for our model of the doped fullerenes ( cf .",
    "e.g.  fig .  3 of ref .  )",
    "we see that both @xmath121 and @xmath122 are shifted upwards , compared to the center of the band , hence , looking at ( [ lanczos ] ) we find that for a single electron the third moment is positive : @xmath123 . together with the reduction of the frustration for larger filling , we therefore expect from ( [ asym ] ) that for the alkali doped fullerenes @xmath124 ; i.e.  @xmath125 , as is found in the monte carlo calculations .",
    "using quantum monte carlo , we have analyzed a model of alkali - doped fullerenes and found that the mott transition strongly depends on the ( integer ) filling @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath9 is largest for @xmath118 and decreases away from half - filling .",
    "this result is qualitatively different from both , the results of density functional calculations in the local density approximation , and the results of hartree - fock calculations .",
    "the doping dependence of the mott transition can be understood in terms of a simple hopping argument .",
    "the key observation is that , due to the orbital degeneracy , there are more hopping channels in the many - body than in the single - body case , thus leading to the degeneracy enhancement @xmath73 discussed above . in addition , due to frustration , the gaps are not symmetric around half - filling .",
    "the gutzwiller approximation for a paramagnetic state also predicts a degeneracy enhancement.@xcite for a half - filled system , the predicted enhancement is , however , linear in the degeneracy @xmath126 instead of @xmath127 as suggested by the hopping argument of sec .",
