    "determination of elemental abundances , depletions , and physical conditions in the mc ism therefore provides interesting tests for theoretical models of interstellar clouds and dust grains , and should also yield insights into the nature of the even lower metallicity qso absorption - line systems .",
    "most studies of the optical absorption lines of ca  ii and na  i have focused on the kinematics and structure of the mc ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see @xcite ) . while uv spectra of many mc stars were obtained with _ iue _ , the relatively low resolution ( fwhm @xmath1 2025 km  s@xmath2 ) and generally low s / n made it very difficult to determine accurate abundances and physical conditions for individual interstellar clouds in the generally complex mc sightlines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "new observing capabilities ( both on the ground and in space ) are enabling much more detailed studies of the mc ism , however ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this contribution , we focus on recent studies of the predominantly neutral gas in the mc , based on high - resolution optical spectra and on uv spectra from _ iue _ , _ hst _ ( ghrs and stis ) , and _",

    "the main lmc component groups ( 810 ) , with total @xmath0(h ) @xmath1 2.8 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 , have relative abundances [ x / zn ] similar to those found for galactic `` warm , diffuse '' clouds ( fig .  2 ) .",

    "the apparent underabundance of n  i in the weaker component may be due to partial ionization . combining a ( tentative ) detection of c  i with a limit on @xmath14 ( from analysis of the c  ii fine structure excitation ) suggests either a relatively weak radiation field or a relatively low @xmath15 for the stronger component .",

    "striking differences between the profiles of trace neutral species , dominant depleted species ( e.g. , fe  ii , ni  ii ) , and dominant undepleted species ( e.g. , s  ii , zn  ii ) imply significant variations in depletions and physical conditions among the three main smc component groups ( a , b , c ) .",

    "intriguingly , the strongest cl  i ( which should track h@xmath9 ) is not in the component with the most severe depletions of fe and ni  which may suggest differences in the relationship between molecular fraction and depletions in the smc .",
    "the relative abundances in the lmc gas ( total line of sight values toward four stars ) are broadly similar to those found for warm , diffuse clouds in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "the available diagnostics ( e.g. , higher resolution na  i and ca  ii spectra , c  i fine structure ) suggest that the individual components are likely characterized by wider ranges in depletions and physical conditions , however . higher resolution uv spectra for three smc sightlines do reveal significant differences in depletions ( from mild to severe ) and physical conditions for individual components  both within the smc and relative to the galactic ism . we conclude with some implications and areas for further study :    if si is generally undepleted in the smc , then models of smc dust  which rely heavily on silicates ( @xcite )  will need revision ; oxides and/or metallic fe grains may dominate .",
    "if si is also undepleted in qso absorption - line systems ( which resemble the smc ism in some respects ) , then observed qsoals [ si / fe ] ratios would not imply enhanced @xmath22-element / fe ratios .",
    "the higher pressures found toward sk 155 are consistent with theoretical models ; are such elevated pressures characteristic of the smc ism ?",
    "general weakness of the trace neutral species ( e.g. , na  i , c  i ) in the mc , relative to h  even after accounting for the lower metallicity and stronger radiation fields  may provide further evidence for additional processes affecting the ionization of heavy elements in the ism ( @xcite ) .",
    "a new _ fuse _ survey of h@xmath9 toward 70 mc stars has revealed some differences in the behavior of h@xmath9 , relative to that in the galactic ism ( @xcite ) ; comparisons of depletions and h@xmath9 , for the different environmental conditions in the milky way and mc , should give insight into the relationships between h@xmath9 , dust , and local physical conditions .",
