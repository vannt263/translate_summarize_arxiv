    "recently , it has been recognized that quantum optical systems involving highly - excited atomic rydberg levels can provide a promising perspective for the applications in quantum information processing , quantum metrology , and quantum simulation @xcite . in particular , the huge polarizability of rydberg states gives rise to giant kerr coefficients which enable the nonlinear optical effects , such as electromagnetically induced transparency , in the single - photon level @xcite .",
    "it also induces the strong dipole - dipole or van der waals interactions between neighboring rydberg atoms which can be used to implement atom - photon and photon - photon phase gates @xcite , effective photon - photon interactions @xcite , and deterministic single - photon sources @xcite .    in experimental realizations of these and other applications",
    ", it will be essential to have methods available to efficiently transfer ground - state atoms into and out of the highly - excited rydberg states @xcite . in the direct excitation case , except the requirement of deep ultraviolet wavelengths of the lasers , a poor selectivity of the excitation due to the optical mixing of",

    "these shortcomings can be made up by a multi - step excitation via some intermediate states @xcite .",
    "especially , the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is a powerful technique that is used intensively in preparing and manipulating atomic and molecular states @xcite .",
    "it is more robust to overcome the effects of the doppler broadening , spatial laser - pulse inhomogeneities , and the spontaneous decay of the intermediate excited state .",
    "however , the ingenious formation of the dark state restricts the application of the stirap to the three - level excitation scheme . the multi - photon adiabatic passage and the fractional stirap with optimal pulse sequences",
    "are thus extensively studied @xcite to realize highly efficient excitation in the four- or even more level schemes .",
    "compared to the general atomic excitation , strong interatomic interaction induced by the huge dipole moment of rydberg states may result in poor effects of all above excitation strategies in the rydberg excitation .",

    "the influence of the rydberg - rydberg interaction on this excitation scheme is investigated and discussed .",
    "we further find the detuning with respect to the other intermediate state could be an effective control knob to reduce the destructive effect of the rydberg - rydberg interaction to the excitation .",

    "in summary , we present a highly efficient three - photon cascade excitation scheme for rydberg atoms .",
    "different from the typical two - photon excitation scheme with the stirap , our scheme is based on a novel quasi - dark eigen - state which appears when the frequencies of the optical pulses are appropriately chirped .",
