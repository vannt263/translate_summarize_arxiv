    "domain wall fermions ( dwf ) for lattice gauge theories were developed in @xcite . since then",
    "a wealth of activity has followed with the main focus being the application of dwf to chiral lattice gauge theories , but also to vector lattice gauge theories ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as a result of these works little doubt remains that dwf can be used to regularize vector gauge theories on the lattice . because dwf have many attractive features it is surprising that little work has been done in the past few years investigating their practicality and usefulness in numerical simulations of lattice vector gauge theories .",
    "a preliminary investigation of this , in the context of the vector schwinger model , is presented here .",
    "the massless case of the one flavor model is described by the lattice euclidean action : @xmath0 = \\beta [ 1 - \\sum_p re(u_p ) ]   - \\bar\\psi { \\cal m}(u ) \\psi",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] -0.4 truecm @xmath1 -0.5 truecm @xmath2   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] -0.5 truecm @xmath3 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] -0.5 truecm @xmath4 \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath5 is the u(1 ) gauge field , @xmath6 the standard plaquette , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the gauge coupling , and @xmath9 is a collective space time coordinate .",
    "the photon mass is @xmath10 and the space time volume is @xmath11 .",
    "the key ingredient of dwf is the introduction of the extra direction @xmath12 , with periodic boundary conditions , size @xmath13 , and a mass defect at @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) . in the free case",
    "a dirac fermion appears with its right component exponentially peaked at @xmath14 and its left one at @xmath15 .",
    "the overlap of the left and right components is small and decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath13 . in the limit @xmath20 one",
    "obtains a single massless dirac fermion .",
    "the introduction of the extra direction also introduces heavy modes .",
    "their contribution needs to be subtracted @xcite .",
    "this is done by dividing the fermionic determinant , @xmath21 $ ] by @xmath22 \\det[{\\cal m}_-]}$ ] , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the same as @xmath25 but with @xmath26 , @xmath27 respectively",
    ". these determinants can be produced by introducing appropriate auxiliary bosonic fields .",
    "there are two implementations of dwf that can be used in numerical simulations :    * i * the overlap formalism @xcite .",
    "a transfer matrix is constructed along the extra direction and from it the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath28 is extracted .",
    "this formulation allows for the strict @xmath29 limit to be taken .",
    "observables can be calculated by obtaining all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath28 ( @xmath30 is a matrix of size @xmath31 ) .",
    "the lattice vector schwinger model was simulated successfully using this method @xcite .",
    "however , the method requires large amounts of computer time and high statistics simulations in four dimensions and large volumes may not be possible at present .    *",
    "ii * a direct simulation of ( [ action ] ) with @xmath13 finite .",
    "the chiral limit is obtained by extrapolating to the @xmath20 limit .",
    "this method is very attractive for several reasons :    * a ) * unlike wilson fermions there is no fine tuning involved ; the chiral limit is the @xmath32 limit . at the @xmath29",
    "limit the quark mass is multiplicatively renormalized @xcite ( for a recent investigation of this using hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) see @xcite ) .",
    "although for finite @xmath13 there will always be an additive component its size is expected to be decreasing exponentially with @xmath13 .",
    "* b ) * unlike staggered fermions there is no breaking of flavor symmetry on the lattice .",
    "* c ) * because the overlap of the left and right components is exponentially small in the free case , one would expect that very small explicit breaking of chiral symmetry can be obtained for a relatively small @xmath13 .",
    "if this is the case , then the method will be very valuable in studies involving spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "* d ) * anomalous symmetry breaking has a natural interpretation @xcite and one may expect that this will facilitate related studies .",
    "of course , there is a price to be paid for these nice features .",
    "the theory has one more dimension and therefore demands more computer resources .",
    "given the above considerations several questions should be answered before dwf can be used to simulate lattice vector gauge theories and in particular lattice qcd .",
    "are there any hidden difficulties in an hmc simulation of the model ? does the method work and give the correct answers ?",
    "how does the computational difficulty depend on @xmath13 and how large should @xmath13 be ? how does the computational difficulty of dwf compare with wilson or staggered fermions ?",
    "how good are dwf in addressing questions related to anomalous breaking of axial symmetries and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetries ?",
    "preliminary answers to a few of these questions are presented below .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence can be investigated by direct comparison with the @xmath32 result obtained using the overlap formalism . in the massless case the fermionic effective action @xmath33 is finite in the zero topological sector and @xmath34 otherwise . on an @xmath35 lattice",
    ", @xmath33 is calculated for several @xmath13 for a background gauge field with topological charge @xmath36 in figure 1 , and with charge @xmath37 in figure 2 .",
    "the very different @xmath13 dependence in the two topological sectors is evident .",
    "this indicates that dwf correctly reproduce topological effects already at @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the overlap result in the zero topological sector ( dashed line in figure 1 ) is also reached at @xmath39 .",
    "similar results for the size of @xmath13 have been obtained from studies of the pion mass in the @xmath36 sector @xcite .",
    "a variant of ( [ action ] ) developed in @xcite is most suited for use with the hmc algorithm .",
    "the basic difference is that @xmath40 but free boundary conditions are used along the extra direction .",
    "the two chiral modes are now bound to the two free boundaries .",
    "a mass term connects the free boundaries and introduces a bare quark mass @xmath41 .",
    "the advantage of this is that it only needs half the size of @xmath13 and also only a single bosonic field to perform the subtraction mentioned earlier .",
    "the massive @xmath42 flavor vector schwinger model is simulated using this formulation and the hmc algorithm .",
    "the expectation value of the operator @xmath43 is calculated .",
    "if the volume is kept fixed and @xmath41 is made very small the effect of the zero modes coming from different topological sectors becomes important @xcite .",
    "in particular , as can be seen from the overlap implementation @xcite @xcite , in the massless and @xmath32 limit the operator @xmath44 receives contributions only from sectors @xmath45 , while the fermion boltzman weight ( fermion determinant ) is not zero only in sector 0 . as @xmath41 is turned on ( and/or @xmath13",
    "is decreased from infinity ) the fermionic determinant becomes non zero in sectors other than @xmath36 and the operator @xmath44 receives contributions from sectors other than @xmath46 .",
    "therefore for small @xmath41 the hmc algorithm will mostly sample the sector @xmath36 where the observable @xmath44 receives small contributions .",
    "the algorithm will infrequently visit the sectors @xmath45 but when it does the observable @xmath44 will receive large contributions to make up for the small sampling rate . as a result , when @xmath41 is decreased a larger number of hmc iterations will be needed to sample the @xmath45 sectors correctly .",
    "preliminary results are presented for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the hmc sweeps vary from @xmath50 for @xmath51 to @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the trajectory length is @xmath37 and the step size is @xmath54 for @xmath51 and @xmath55 for the rest .",
    "the average conjugate gradient iterations vary from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the time history of @xmath44 for @xmath51 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the large `` spikes '' are related to configurations with charge @xmath45 ( measured with the geometric method ) . @xmath58 vs. @xmath41 is in fig . 4 and agrees roughly with the @xmath59 overlap result @xcite .",
    "for comparison with the exact answer see @xcite ."
