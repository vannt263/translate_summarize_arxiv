    "<S> we explore for the first time the possibilities to measure an intermediate - mass ( @xmath0  115    140  ) standard - model higgs boson in electromagnetic proton - lead ( @xmath1pb ) interactions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) via its @xmath2 decay . using equivalent weizscker - williams photon fluxes and higgs effective field theory for the coupling @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a leading - order cross section of the order of 0.3  pb for exclusive higgs production in elastic ( @xmath4pb@xmath5pb ) and semielastic ( @xmath4pb@xmath6pb ) processes at @xmath7  =  8.8 tev . after applying various kinematics cuts to remove the main backgrounds ( @xmath8 and misidentified @xmath9 events ) , we find that a higgs boson with @xmath10  =  120  could be observed in the @xmath2 channel with a 3@xmath11-significance integrating 300  pb@xmath12 with an upgraded @xmath1a  luminosity of 10@xmath13@xmath14s@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide for the first time semielastic higgs cross sections , along with elastic @xmath15 cross sections , for electromagnetic @xmath16 , @xmath1a  and aa  collisions at the lhc . </S>"
