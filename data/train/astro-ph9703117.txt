    "long - term numerical integrations play an important role in our understanding of the dynamical evolution of many astrophysical systems ( see , e.g. , duncan , these proceedings , for a review of solar - system integrations ) .",
    "an essential tool for long - term integrations is a fast and accurate integration algorithm .",
    "symplectic integration algorithms ( sias ) have become popular in recent years because the newtonian gravitational @xmath0-body problem is a hamiltonian problem and sias enforce certain conservation laws that are intrinsic to hamiltonian systems ( see sanz - serna & calvo 1994 for a general introduction to sias ) .    for an autonomous hamiltonian system ,",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the explicitly time - independent hamiltonian , @xmath3 are the @xmath4 canonical phase - space coordinates , @xmath5 is the poisson bracket , and @xmath6(@xmath7 ) is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the formal solution of eq.([heq ] ) is @xmath8 if the hamiltonian @xmath9 has the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are separately integrable , we can devise a sia of constant timestep @xmath13 by approximating @xmath14 as a composition of terms like @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for example , a second - order sia is @xmath17    for the gravitational @xmath0-body problem , we can write @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the kinetic and potential energies . then the second - order sia eq.([sia2 ] ) becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; this is the familiar leapfrog integrator . for solar - system type integrations ,",
    "a central body ( the sun ) is much more massive than the other bodies in the system , and it is better to write @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the part of the hamiltonian that describes the keplerian motion of the bodies around the central body and @xmath26 is the part that describes the perturbation of the bodies on one another .",
    "symplectic integrators using this decomposition of the hamiltonian were introduced by wisdom & holman ( 1991 ) , and they are commonly called mixed variable symplectic ( mvs ) integrators .",
    "the constant timestep sias have the following desirable properties :    \\(1 ) as their names imply , sias are symplectic , i.e. , they preserve @xmath27 .",
    "\\(2 ) for sufficiently small @xmath13 , sias solve almost exactly a nearby `` surrogate '' autonomous hamiltonian problem with @xmath28 .",
    "for example , the second - order sia in eq.([sia2 ] ) has @xmath29 consequently , we expect that the energy error is bounded and the position ( or phase ) error grows linearly .",
    "\\(3 ) many sias ( e.g. , eq.[[sia2 ] ] ) are time reversible .",
    "note , however , that there are algorithms that are symplectic but not reversible .",
    "1 shows the energy error @xmath30 of an integration of the @xmath31 kepler orbit using the constant timestep leapfrog integrator eq.([lf ] ) .",
    "( in this and all subsequent figures , the orbits are initially at the apocenter @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the semi - major axis and eccentricity . )",
    "1 illustrates that there is no secular drift in @xmath30 .",
    "for problems with large variations in timescale ( due to close encounters or high eccentricities ) , it is desirable to use a variable timestep . a common practice is to set the timestep using the phase - space coordinates @xmath35 at the beginning of the timestep : @xmath36 . if the sias discussed in   1",
    "are implemented with this simple variable timestep scheme , they are still symplectic if we assume that the sequence of timesteps determined for a particular initial condition are also used to integrate neighboring initial conditions ( see skeel & gear 1992 for another point of view ) .",
    "however , tests have shown that this and similar simple variable timestep schemes [ and also @xmath37 destroy the desirable properties of the integrators ( e.g. , gladman , duncan , & candy 1991 ; calvo & sanz - serna 1993 ) . in fig .",
    "2_a _ we show the energy error of an integration with @xmath31 and @xmath38 .",
    "although the error is initially smaller than that in fig .  1 ( the integrations shown in figs .  1 and 2 use nearly the same number of timesteps per orbit ) , it shows a linear drift . in fig.2_a",
    "_ we also show the errors for two neighboring initial conditions ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "they were integrated using the timesteps determined for the @xmath31 orbit .",
    "note that these errors grow even faster .",
    "the degradation in performance is due to the fact that the properties ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) listed in   1 are no longer true .",
    "the algorithm is not time reversible because the timestep depends only on the coordinates at the beginning of the timestep . since @xmath40 depends explicitly on the timestep @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , eq.[[herr ] ] ) , a variable timestep changes the surrogate hamiltonian problem that the integrator is solving from step to step .",
    "thus the solution from @xmath41 to @xmath42 after @xmath43 steps is not in general the solution of a nearby autonomous hamiltonian problem .",
    "hut , makino , & mcmillan ( 1995 ; see also funato et al .",
    "1996 ; hut , these proceedings ) pointed out that the performance of a variable timestep integrator can be improved if time reversibility is restored by choosing the timestep in a time symmetric manner : @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "for example , @xmath46/2 $ ] .",
    "we have tested this idea in detail by ( i ) integrating a series of problems ( the pendulum , kepler orbits , and the restricted @xmath47-body problem ) using a symmetrized variable timestep leapfrog integrator and ( ii ) integrating the restricted @xmath47-body problem using a symmetrized mvs integrator .",
    "we have found that time symmetrization usually reduces the drift in energy ( or the jacobi constant ) to negligible levels .",
    "2_b _ shows an integration of the @xmath31 kepler orbit using the symmetrized leapfrog integrator , and it should be compared to fig .",
    "2_a_.    in fig",
    ".  2_b _ we also show the errors for two neighboring initial conditions that were integrated using the timesteps determined for the @xmath31 orbit .",
    "there is no improvement in the error growth for the neighboring initial conditions .",
    "integrating an orbit using the timesteps determined for another orbit may seem to be somewhat artificial , but similar situations do occur in realistic integrations .",
    "for example , if we integrate an @xmath0-body system using a shared timestep scheme , the timestep used by all of the particles is determined by the few having the strongest close encounter . in practice",
    ", since the symmetrized timestep criterion depends on @xmath48 , a symmetrized integrator also has the disadvantage that it requires iteration and can be significantly slower than the original integrator ( unless the original integrator is also implicit ) .",
    "in this section we describe a `` variable timestep '' sia that has all the desirable properties of the constant timestep sias . the algorithm is based on ideas proposed by skeel & biesiadecki ( 1994 ; see also macevoy & scovel 1994 ) .",
    "it is also similar to the individual timestep scheme of saha & tremaine ( 1994 ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider in particular the kepler problem with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we choose a set of cutoff radii @xmath51 and decompose the potential @xmath52 into @xmath53 , or equivalently the force @xmath54 into @xmath55 , such that ( i ) @xmath56 , ( ii ) @xmath57 ( except @xmath58 ) is zero at @xmath59 , and ( iii ) @xmath57 is `` softer '' than @xmath60 .",
    "the force @xmath57 is to be applied with a timestep @xmath61 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath62 is an integer , we can apply the second - order sia in eq.([sia2 ] ) recursively to obtain the following second - order algorithm : @xmath63\\ ,                \\exp({\\tau_0 \\over 2 } k_0 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx&\\!\\ ! \\exp({\\tau_0 \\over 2 } k_0)\\ , \\biggl [                \\exp({\\tau_1 \\over 2 } k_1)\\ ,                \\exp[\\tau_1 ( d + k_2 + k_3 + \\cdots ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad \\times \\exp({\\tau_1 \\over 2 } k_1)\\biggr]^{m_1}\\ ,                 \\exp({\\tau_0 \\over 2 } k_0 ) \\label{vsia2 } \\\\ & \\vdots & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "hereafter , we adopt @xmath66 .    the multiple timescale algorithm eq.([vsia2 ] )",
    "has an overall timestep @xmath67 , but it is effectively a variable timestep scheme because the recursion terminates at level @xmath68 if @xmath69 during a substep of length @xmath61 .",
    "for example , if the particle is in the region @xmath70 during an overall step , eq.([vsia2 ] ) reduces to @xmath71 since eq.([vsia2 ] ) is based on the recursive application of eq.([sia2 ] ) , it has all the desirable properties of a constant timestep sia .",
    "it is obviously symplectic and time reversible",
    ". we can also derive the surrogate autonomous hamiltonian solved by this integrator .",
    "for example , if we decompose @xmath52 into two levels @xmath72 and @xmath73 only , the error hamiltonian is ( cf .",
    "eq.[[herr ] ] ) @xmath74      after some experiments , we found two force decompositions that work well .",
    "if we write @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , one of the decompositions is @xmath78 \\vecr/4 r_i^3 & \\mbox{if $ r < r_i$. } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] an alternative decomposition uses @xmath79 where @xmath80 . unlike the forces suggested by skeel & biesiadecki ( 1994 ) , these forces have continuous first derivatives and decrease rapidly ( or exactly ) to zero at @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "we shall not provide the details here , but we can understand why these properties are important from an analysis of @xmath40 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the energy error @xmath30 of two integrations using the multiple timescale symplectic integrator with @xmath82 . as expected , there is no secular drift in @xmath30 .",
    "note also that , with the chosen integration parameters ( @xmath83 ) , the maximum error is almost independent of the pericentric distance ( which changes by @xmath84 in the two cases shown ) .",
    "this again agrees with the expectation from an analysis of @xmath40 .",
    "one of the goals of this study is to develop a variable timestep integrator for solar system integrations .",
    "we have developed a second - order multiple timescale mvs integrator based on the algorithm described in this section ( see levison & duncan 1994 for another approach ) .",
    "we are currently testing this integrator in detail .",
    "initial results indicate that the integrator is fast and accurate and has all the desirable properties of the constant timestep symplectic integrators .",
