    "lattice field theory with the @xmath0 term suffers from the sign problem . a conventional technique to circumvent it is to perform the fourier transform of the topological charge distribution @xmath2 in order to calculate the partition function @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath2 is calculated with real positive boltzmann weight .",
    "however , this still causes flattening of the free energy , which misleads to a fictitious signal of a first order phase transition . to overcome",
    "this problem requires exponentially increasing statistics with lattice volume .",
    "we consider the issue of flattening in terms of the maximum entropy method ( mem )  @xcite . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite ( referred to as ( i ) hereafter ) , we used mock data constructed by the gaussian @xmath2 whose corresponding free energy is analytically known to have no singular structure at values of @xmath0 for @xmath4 and tested whether the mem would be effective in the case with flattening as well as without flattening . in the case without flattening , the results of the mem agree with the exact results . in the case with flattening",
    ", the mem gives smoother @xmath1 than that of the fourier transform .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider an opposite case to the above , i.e. , consider a model that causes real flattening , which will be explained later .",
    "this mimics a case where non trivial phase structure occurs at finite value of @xmath0 @xmath5 .",
    "we generate mock data based on the model and apply the mem to them .",
    "our aim is to study ( i ) whether flattening would be properly reproduced in this model and ( ii ) how true and fictitious flattening are distinguished in the mem analysis .",
    "the partition function @xmath3 can be obtained by fourier - transforming the topological charge distribution @xmath2 : @xmath6e^{-s+i\\theta\\hat{q}(\\bar{z},z ) } }     { \\int[d\\bar{z}dz]e^{-s}}\\equiv\\sum_{q}e^{i\\theta q}p(q ) ,      \\label{eqn : partitionfunction}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the action , and @xmath8 is the topological charge described by lattice fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution @xmath2 obtained from mc simulations can be decomposed into two parts , a true value and an error of @xmath2 .",
    "when the error at @xmath11 dominates , the free energy density could develop a flat region in the large @xmath0 region , which misleads one into identifying flattening as a signal of a first order phase transition at a finite value of @xmath0  @xcite .    instead of dealing with eq .",

    "@xmath43 becomes @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "these values agree with those of flattening observed in fig .",

    "[ fig : zv50c4e-3 ] . for @xmath54 , however , this is not the case .",
    "we find that the critical value of @xmath27 above which flattening is properly reproduced is @xmath55 .",

    ", we have applied the mem to mock data with true flattening and found that flattening is well reproduced .",
