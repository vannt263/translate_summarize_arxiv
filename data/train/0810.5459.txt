    "in a doped semiconductor at low temperature , electron transport can be dominated by variable range hopping of localized electrons.@xcite if the active impurities are sufficiently close , the coulomb interaction between the localized electrons will give an important contribution to the disorder of the energy levels .",
    "such a system is known as a coulomb glass , where the term glass is due to the many features it shares with other glasses , including slow dynamics and aging , and short distance correlations combined with long range disorder .",
    "coulomb glasses have been studied extensively both numerically and analytically . among the top theoretical results describing the model",
    "is the derivation by efros and shklovskii of the coulomb gap , a gap in the distribution of single electron state energies at any given time.@xcite    among the most interesting experimental results we would like to mention the demonstration of memory effects in the conductivity experiments performed by ovadyahu et al.,@xcite and the large @xmath8-noise increase related to the metal - insulator transition observed by kar et al.@xcite    the first simulations trying to model the coulomb glass were performed by kurosawa.@xcite later several groups have studied various parameter spaces , using very different approaches . in all approaches we have found , the defects have been modeled as static sites , with the electrons jumping from site to site .",
    "the number of electrons is usually chosen to be half that of the sites , reflecting a symmetry in states over and under the fermi level .    the disorder of the system can be modeled in two different ways .",
    "first , one can choose to place the sites the electrons can jump between in a regular lattice , and introduce disorder through a local site energy .",
    "this means distances are functions of site index difference only , greatly reducing calculational effort .",
    "the second possibility is having sites of equal local site energy , and introducing disorder through the position of the sites .",
    "this gives the advantage of a symmetry in occupation numbers , changing the occupation of all states gives a state of the same energy , allowing a convenient definition of an order parameter.@xcite the applicability of this order parameter has recently been disputed by matulewski et al.,@xcite who claim that the long range interaction of the electrons leads to a system size dependence of the order parameter , and that the temperature where it goes to zero depends on the minimal inter - site distance allowed .",
    "it can be argued that positional disorder requires smaller system sizes for good statistics at low temperatures , as the energy disorder will lead to some sites `` freezing out '' and having fixed occupation probability .",
    "however , it is possible that the two models can give very different behavior , so the further study of both is definitely justified",
    ".    the most realistic model would be to study a 3d model . still , many simulations , including ours , use a 2d model only .",
    "the advantage of this is that we can study systems of much larger linear dimension , which we assume to be important due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "next , choice of temperature range greatly affects the choice of algorithm . for small systems at extremely low temperatures ,",
    "it is possible to imagine that all configurations relevant for the dynamics can be mapped , and transitions between these calculated.@xcite this allows studying the effect of transitions involving multiple simultaneous electron jumps .",
    "increases in size and temperature rapidly makes this method impossible , even with the best future supercomputers .",
    "fortunately , increasing temperature also reduces the role of multi - electron jumps,@xcite as a wider range of states is accessible .    at higher temperatures ,",
    "monte carlo simulations have been performed in various ways , which can be divided in two groups . at high temperatures ,",
    "the metropolis algorithm of picking a possible jump and accepting it with a given probability is very efficient.@xcite at lower temperatures , where only a small number of jumps are probable , one can calculate all possible jump rates , and accept one jump based on relative probabilities.@xcite various optimizations and hybrids of these methods have also been used .",
    "our simulations belong to the latter category , and includes some optimizations we have not seen elsewhere .    our long term goal in starting this work is to study conductance in coulomb glasses , and in particular to try to demonstrate the interesting effects observed in experiments.@xcite in order to achieve this , we need to establish which model and parameter choice is appropriate .",
    "for example , tsigankov et .",
    "al.@xcite argue that the variations in conductivity observed in ovadyahu s experiments can be reproduced for the random position model , but not for the lattice model , both at a temperature of @xmath9 .",
    "our results indicate that this may be due to the transition temperature for this kind of behavior being lower than @xmath9 for the lattice model , while it happens at a higher temperature for the position disorder .",
    "this demonstrates how insufficient charting of the parameter space may lead to wasted effort later . after surveying the literature ,",
    "we have realized that there is not even agreement on whether there is a glass transition at any finite temperature for the lattice model in 2 dimensions .    in principle , we need a complete understanding of the roles of all the adjustable parameters ; temperature , electron localization length , disorder strength , disorder type , time scale and system size . in the present paper",
    ", we have chosen to focus on the time scale of equilibration of the system . in this way",
    "give an upper temperature limit for when glassy effects can be observed , and estimate how the time scales of these effects change with temperature .",
    "in the analysis of the data , we have been inspired by work on spin glasses , which show many of the same features as coulomb glasses .",
    "this is a field which has been studied in much greater detail .",
    "we have based our analysis on work by ogielski,@xcite whose methods have been a powerful tool in understanding our results .",
    "we find that there are clear similarities in our results and those obtained for spin glasses .",
    "for example , we have found that the correlation function of the energy follows a stretched exponential behavior at long times , a result we have not seen in previous discussions on coulomb glasses .",
    "however , neither the distance dependent interaction nor the charge conservation requirements found in coulomb glasses have obvious parallels in the spin glass .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the exponent we observe in the stretched exponential behaves differently from what has been reported for spin glasses .",
    "we have used the standard 2d lattice model with hamiltonian @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the average occupancy , @xmath12 is the occupancy of site @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the distance between sites @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the site occupancy energy of site @xmath13 , drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "all energies and temperatures are measured in units of the nearest neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the lattice constant and @xmath20 is the elementary charge .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in both dimensions , and side lengths of @xmath21 , forcing us to cut off the coulomb interaction at the distance @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the total number of sites . in all simulations presented here ,",
    "we have used @xmath24 , as this is standard in the literature .",
    "however , it should be noted that at this value of the disorder , the coulomb gap does not have the universal shape predicted by efros and shklovskii,@xcite as shown in refs . .",
    "while this may be of importance for details in the temperature dependence of various quantities , we do not believe that it will significantly affect our results .    in order to calculate changes in the system energy @xmath25",
    ", we use the `` single electron energy '' @xmath26 , defined by efros and shklovskii , the energy gained by adding an electron to an empty site , or required to remove the electron from an occupied site .",
    "it is given by @xmath27 the change in system energy due to an electron hopping from site @xmath13 to site @xmath15 is then @xmath28 the impurities are modeled as hydrogen - like states centered on the lattice sites , with a localization length @xmath29 chosen to be @xmath30 .",
    "the relaxation has been performed by a modified monte - carlo simulation optimized for low temperatures , but still capable of handling high temperatures .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithm is given in appendix [ algorithm ] , along with a discussion of the chosen parameters .",
    "we follow efros and shklovskii@xcite and write the electron jump rate for the jump from the occupied site @xmath13 to the unoccupied site @xmath15 as @xmath31 where for processes involving phonon emission , @xmath32 while for phonon absorption @xmath33 we have made no estimates for the numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so for the plots showing a time scale , they should both be taken as unity .",
    "the time for one electron jump , @xmath36 , is the inverse of the total rate @xmath37 this is the time during which , on average , one jump takes place . to get the correct noise spectrum at very short time scales ,",
    "@xmath38 should have been drawn from a distribution with average @xmath39 , this we have ignored .",
    "we have not seen any other simulations stating that they use the full expressions for the jump probability , most authors seem to use the low temperature limit of the expressions to reduce computational effort .",
    "temperature in all equations is the phonon bath temperature .",
    "in order to study the temperature dependence of the relaxation process , all relaxations were started from the same random electron configuration , representing an infinite temperature and with the same realization of disorder .",
    "we then set the phonon bath to a given temperature , simulating a rapid quench .",
    "we follow the relaxation process by plotting the total system energy as function of time , as done by ortuo et al @xcite for the model with positional disorder . as shown in figure [ basicrel ] , the processes initially looks the same at all temperatures .",
    "this is because the system is still at some high energy and does not `` feel '' the differences in phonon temperature which are small compared to the initial infinite temperature of the system . in this regime , essentially",
    "all jumps reduce the total energy of the system .",
    "then , starting with the highest temperatures , one by one the systems seem to reach an equilibrium behavior , with the energy fluctuating around some average value .",
    "for all temperatures we observe that the relaxation is slower than exponential .",
    "for the lowest temperatures ( @xmath40 ) we are not able to reach the equilibrium state , and the system continues to relax to lower energies for our entire simulation time .",
    "plot of the relaxation from @xmath41 at temperatures @xmath42 , the equilibrium energy decreases with @xmath1 .",
    "we see that for @xmath43 we still get an equilibrium , while for @xmath44 or lower , equilibrium is not achieved at our time scale .",
    "close - ups of the tails of the two lowest graphs are shown in fig .",
    "[ zoomrel ] ]    zooming in on the different relaxation graphs , we can see significant qualitative differences , as shown in fig .",
    "[ zoomrel ] . at high temperatures where equilibrium is reached ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "we see something resembling a random walk in a confining potential ( fig . [",
    "zoomrel]c ) . for @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ zoomrel]b ) we see periods with something like a random walk around a central value , similar to the high temperature equilibrium case . at intervals",
    "this is interrupted by a sudden marked decrease in the energy , and the process continues with a lower mean energy .",
    "the periods of apparent equilibrium can be understood as some local equilibrium around a metastable local minimum of the energy and the steps correspond to the system crossing to a different local minimum .",
    "we have also observed steps that increase the energy , but they are usually smaller and less frequent , so that the long time average still is decreasing for the whole simulation period . for the lowest temperatures ( fig . [",
    "zoomrel]a ) , we see the energy making small fluctuations from a clearly defined lowest level , which again decreases in clear steps",
    ". the steps are now much larger than the width of the distribution within one step . at these temperatures",
    ", the system actually finds the local minimal state and spends a considerable fraction of the time in this state .",
    "we believe that this is an effect of the finite size of our system , and that if we had increased the system size , the number of states accessible close to the local minimum would also increase .",
    "the system would then not so easily find its way to the local minimum , and we would get a picture similar to fig . [ zoomrel]b even at the lowest temperatures . the nature and statistics of the steps are discussed in greater detail in appendix [ stepsappendix ] .",
