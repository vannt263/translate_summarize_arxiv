    "reverse stretches of the orbit @xmath65 as a `` close encounter '' or , more shortly , an `` encounter '' .",
    "the two pieces of @xmath65 separated by the encounter are called the `` left part '' and the `` right part '' .",

    "more precisely , the more symmetric the two orbit stretches of @xmath65 are with respect to time reversal the closer is @xmath111 to either @xmath65 or @xmath90 and the smaller the action difference @xmath112 . because the periods of the orbits involved in the sum ( [ gen_k ] ) are on the scale of the heisenberg time @xmath113 , eq .",

    "both , @xmath65 and its associated partner orbit @xmath111 share the property to have two almost time ",
    "reverse stretches , which are approximately the same for both orbits .",
    "the partner orbit of @xmath111 coincides with the original orbit @xmath65 .",
    "all previous works  @xcite dealing with the contribution of the pairs @xmath114 of partner orbits to the semiclassical form factor have been restricted to systems with two degrees of freedom .",

    "the right loop is traversed in the same direction while the left loop is traversed with different orientation , hence requiring time  reversal symmetry . in order that the two stretches of the orbit near the self  intersection be almost symmetric with respect to time reversal",
    ", the two corresponding velocities must be almost antiparallel .",
    "the intersection is then characterized by a small crossing angle @xmath115 .",
    "the orbits @xmath65 and @xmath111 are distinguished by the fact that one has one more self ",

    "this is in contrast to the phase ",
    "space approach , in which the two partner orbits are treated on equal footing . in systems with more than two degrees of freedom , the phase  space approach  @xcite is more appropriate , because for @xmath4 the relevant orbits generally do not have self  intersections in the @xmath8-dimensional configuration space .",

    "we consider systems with time  reversal symmetry , since only in this case the orbit pairs @xmath114 exist .",
