    "such systems not only exploit directed collective scattering ( reflection ) from a large number of very weak scatterers but in addition rely on generating a stronger light force just by applying very high light intensities .",
    "as the effective mechanical coupling grows with the intracavity field amplitude ( i.e. the square root of the photon number ) , the inherently small single photon coupling rate , proportional to the extent of the objects zero - point - motion , can be augmented by several orders of magnitude to produce strong friction forces .    .",

    ". we plan to study this scaling in more detail in the future .     and other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig5].,scaledwidth=46.0% ]      one very useful advantage of the monte carlo simulation approach is that besides averages and expectation values one can also look at individual trajectories , from which one can get interesting clues on the underlying dynamics and direct hints for the expected experimental data . in fig .",

    "as we always know the momentary atom - field wavefunction , we can easily show its correlation with any other system variable .",
    "as expected we see a clear correspondence between the time evolution of the atomic position uncertainty and occupation number and the average photon number in the sine mode .",
    "note that after reaching the ground state the system shows striking and clear quantum jumps between the lowest and first excited state . while it spends long periods in the ground state we see sporadic jumps to the first excited state where the particle remains for surprisingly long time until jumping back .",
    "this should be related with a symmetry change in the particle wave function during such a jump .",
    "while such jumps are forbidden in a standing wave cavity setup , they attain a finite probability in a ring cavity  @xcite , where spontaneous shifts of the trap minimum allow to break the mirror symmetry of the trap .",
    "as these fluctuations are rather rare , the first excited state , once excited , is much more long lived than the second excited trap state , which possesses the same symmetry as the ground state .",
    "the observation of such quantum jumps thus would clearly reveal the quantum nature of the molecule s center of mass dynamics .",
    "lets now add some remarks on the effects of the spontaneous photon scattering rate @xmath137 .",

    "to lowest order , @xmath142 supplements the coupling strength @xmath76 in eqs .   with an imaginary part @xmath143 .",
    "within our model , this implies a renormalizing of the coupling strength from @xmath76 to @xmath144 . in view of @xmath145 ,",
    "the effect is negligible .",
    "a second effect is the diffusion of the momentum triggered by the spontaneously emitted photons . a rate proportional to @xmath146 up to a geometrical factor is obtained that can again be neglected based on the smallness of @xmath147 and the inhibition with the square of the lamb - dicke parameter .",
    "one can extend eqs .   to also include quantum fluctuations of the cosine mode .",
    "the fluctuations of this mode are close to those of the vacuum state with extra terms coming from the scattering of the sine mode photons off the molecule .",
    "qualitatively this leads to a fluctuating trapping frequency @xmath95 ( that is proportional to @xmath148 ) and a fluctuating coupling strength @xmath76 . for a quantitative analysis",
    ", one can notice that in the regime which is optimal for cooling where @xmath87 , the sine mode population is always close to zero ( as shown in eq .  ) and backscattering into the cosine mode can be neglected .",
    "when operating close to resonance , surely a large @xmath54 can lead to a considerable number of photons in the sine mode and the back action and potential shift effects listed above have to be taken into account , for example by following an approach similar to the one in  @xcite .    as first noticed in  @xcite , the linear optomechanical interaction described by eqs .",
    "can lead to entanglement between the two degrees of freedom : vibration of molecule and quadratures of the sine mode , owing to quadrature - quadrature interaction . in terms of the logarithmic negativity ,",
    "a maximum value of around @xmath149 around the optimal cooling regime can be obtained and can be even surpassed by a proper filtering of the cavity output field as suggested in  @xcite . as an advantage over the mirror - field entanglement scheme which is strongly affected by the thermal bath ,",
    "the molecule - field entanglement is effectively obtained under zero temperature conditions .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the ring cavity setup allows for strong coupling between a molecule s motion and the sine mode via scattering of sideband photons from the cosine mode into the sine mode .",
    "the low single molecule field coupling is enhanced by the large photon number of the strongly driven cosine mode . in this regime",
    "the dynamics is similar to the one described in typical optomechanical systems with mirrors or membranes and we predict fast cooling rates .",
    "in contrast to superradiant cooling @xcite we do not need large molecular ensembles from start but rely on a single particle cooling mechanism .",
    "the central technical challenge here seems to generate high enough intensities in a ring cavity to assure trap frequencies larger than the cavity linewidth even at very large pump detunings from any optical resonance . here",
    "mirrors with a finesse over @xmath150 and supporting megawatt intracavity power are needed . from the molecular side",
    "one would like to have a high polarizability per mass with very low absorption at the chosen operating frequency . in this case",
    "even ground state cooling of any polarizable object seems feasible in a suitable ring cavity . as for atoms",
    "it could also be hoped that cooling properties get even more favorable in cavities invoking even more modes as in a confocal setup  @xcite ."
