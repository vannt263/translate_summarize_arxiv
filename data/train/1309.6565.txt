    "a good theoretical understanding of the optimal control of energy conversion processes is a prerequisite for tailoring efficient artificial nanodevices for specific needs .",
    "typical examples are soft and biomatter systems , such as brownian or molecular motors , organic photovoltaic solar cells and quantum dots . with minimization of the system size",
    "thermal fluctuations become relevant and the non - equilibrium behavior of such systems depends strongly on the driving forces and the changes of one system state to another , which are inherently finite in time . thus",
    ", thermodynamic processes take place in finite time and the thermodynamic quantities like heat and work are now random but still fulfill a stochastic energy balance . in these systems",
    "it is useful to introduce microscopic heat and work quantities as random variables whose averages lead to the common thermodynamic quantities .",
    "averages over functions of these microscopic heat and work quantities yield generalized fluctuation theorems ( for reviews , see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a common feature of many artificial nano - sized devices , where fluctuation theorems can be applied , is that those are mostly driven by time - varying external fields ( often called as protocol ) or electrochemical potential differences .    of particular importance of this class of non - equilibrium systems",
    "is to identify the optimal procedure to extract the greatest amount of work from the device operating under given constraints @xcite .",
    "only a few studies so far have addressed the problem of identifying the optimal protocol that yields the minimum amount of work done on the system , which is required to drive a nano - scale system from one equilibrium state to another in finite time @xcite .",
    "note that this formulation is in reverse to the quest for the optimal protocol that provides the greatest amount of work from the artificial device .",
    "whether on a continuous ( langevin equation ) or a discrete ( master equation ) state space , a surprising result of all these studies is that the optimal protocol exhibits sudden jumps at the beginning and at the end of the thermodynamic process , while in between the optimal protocol varies smoothly .",
    "it can be argued that the initial jump in the optimal protocol is an immediate jump from equilibrium to a stationary state and the final jump allows a slower driving of the system at earlier times .    here",
    ", we address a similar question on optimal driving setups .",
    "the focus of this work is on the couplings of the system to reservoirs , which have a strong influence on the specific form of the optimal protocol . to keep the analysis conceptual simple , we consider as working medium a two - state system driven by a time - dependent protocol , which is often called as one of the prototype models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we apply an optimization procedure based on a variational analysis .",
    "this allows us to get an analytic expression of the optimal protocol with respect to different system - reservoir couplings .",
    "we consider a single level system as working medium of an artificial nanodevice , in contact with a particle reservoir at temperature @xmath0 , which is characterized by the chemical potential @xmath1 . in general , the temperature @xmath0 and the chemical potential @xmath1 may also be time dependent .",
    "the site energy @xmath2 is assumed to be time - dependent , which can be modified between an initial value @xmath3 and a final value @xmath4 by an external agent according to a given protocol . in what follows",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the energy difference @xmath5 .",
    "the population of the single level at time @xmath6 is characterized by the occupation probability @xmath7 .",
    "the system dynamics is modeled by a master equation approach with time - dependent rates @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "@xcite accounting for the time evolution of the occupation probability @xmath7 , @xmath10 we assume that these transition rates obey detailed balance at each time instant . due to the time - varying of the site energy @xmath11 , positive or negative energy flows into the system . from the thermodynamic point of view",
    "the time derivative of the internal energy @xmath12 of the artificial nanodevice is the sum of a work flow @xmath13 and a heat flow @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , during the process time @xmath15 the energy change in the system obeys the statistical mechanics formulation of the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the occupation probability of the equilibrium state at the beginning is @xmath20^{-1}$ ] with @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "both work @xmath24 and heat @xmath25 can be interpreted as functionals of the occupation probability and thus depend , in particular , on the realized transition path .",
    "if @xmath26 , the ( positive ) work @xmath27 is done by the system on the environment .",
    "the details of the system - reservoir coupling determine decisive the exchange of particles between the reservoir and the system  @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the form of the transition rates . in order to proceed , we need to specify these rates for configurational transitions consistent with the detailed balance condition . for example , in a quantum dot coupled to a metal lead , the rates @xmath8 and @xmath9 are glauber ( fermi ) rates , i.  e. , @xmath28^{-1}$ ] and @xmath29^{-1}$ ] , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 is the inverse of a characteristic time scale involve in the exchange of particles between the reservoir and the system .",
    "we adopt here symmetric rates @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "symmetric transition rates are widely used in biomatter or ionic systems @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the optimal driving protocol @xmath11 which minimizes the work for the given constraints @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath15 , we apply the proposed procedure given in reference  @xcite . to minimize @xmath37 we have to minimize @xmath38 and maximize @xmath25 simultaneously",
    "since @xmath38 depends only on @xmath39 , we need to maximize the heat @xmath25",
    ". the essential steps of this procedure are : _",
    "( i ) _ find the protocol that gives the maximum heat @xmath25 for a given value of @xmath39 and _ ( ii ) _ conduct the optimization with respect to the final state @xmath39 . to this end",
    "we rewrite the heat as @xmath40 with @xmath41 , because @xmath11 can be expressed as function of @xmath7 and @xmath42 . a variational analysis",
    "@xmath43 leads to the euler - lagrange equation @xmath44 .",
    "here @xmath45 is the constant of integration . for symmetric rates the euler - lagrange equation has the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : p_dot_nonequ ] ) is a quartic equation with respect to @xmath48 , which has two real ( physical ) solutions @xmath49 and two imaginary solutions .",
    "from these two first - order differential equations one can calculate @xmath39 for given @xmath36 and @xmath15 via @xmath50 as function of @xmath51 .",
    "subsequently , @xmath52 can be used to maximize the heat @xmath25 with respect to @xmath51 by performing the integration @xmath53 here , the @xmath51-dependent protocol @xmath54 can be rewritten with respect to @xmath55 . for this purpose , we start from the quartic equation @xmath56 $ ] . using the evolution equation  ( [ eq : master_equ ] ) with symmetric rates and multiplying the quartic equation with @xmath57 , the substitution @xmath58 ; @xmath59 then gives the polynomial equation of 4th order @xmath60 .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "since the relation @xmath65 holds between the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , this quartic equation can be rewritten in a quasi - symmetric equation @xmath69 . using the transformation",

    "let us first take a closer look at the optimal protocol for symmetric rates as function of the processing time @xmath6 for different values of @xmath51 . to this end",
    "we calculate equation  ( [ eq : e_p ] ) and equation  ( [ eq : heat_max ] ) with the upper sign ( + ) by using equation  ( [ eq : p_tau ] ) with the lower sign ( - ) for downward processes . in this case , work is done by the system on the environment .",
    "r0.45     figure  [ fig : fig1](a ) shows both the optimal protocol ( black solid line ) and three non - optimal protocols as function of the processing time @xmath6 .",
    "we can clearly identify jumps of the protocol at the beginning and at the end of the process .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : fig1](b ) , an initially almost empty systems is populated with particles with increasing time . the protocol controls how fast this single level can be occupied .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig : fig1](c ) and ( d ) show other characteristic quantities of the system , such as the entropy change @xmath85 and the heat flow @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the optimal protocol for fast ( @xmath87 ) and slow ( @xmath88 ) processes .",
    "we observe that the associated value of @xmath89 is larger for fast processes than for slow processes .",
    "thus , to understand the meaning of the parameter @xmath51 , we square equation  ( [ eq : p_dot_nonequ ] ) . by using evolution equation ( [ eq : master_equ ] ) with symmetric rates",
    "we arrive , after sorting with respect to @xmath55 , at a quartic equation @xmath90 .",

    "this substitution eliminates the @xmath98 term in 4th order polynomial equation leading to the depressed quartic equation @xmath99 . here , @xmath100 realizing that @xmath101 , the depressed quartic equation can be written in the form @xmath102 , which has two real and two complex conjugated roots .",
    "the two real roots @xmath103 are determined by the branch @xmath104 leading to te expression @xmath105 equation  ( [ eq : p_non_equ ] ) expresses the occupation probability as function of the protocol @xmath54 and @xmath51 .",
    "if we assume a different system - reservoir coupling , say fermi rates , the form of @xmath7 @xcite is quit different from those given in equation  ( [ eq : p_non_equ ] ) .",
    "this emphasizes that the nature of the system - reservoir coupling has a striking influence on the optimal driving setup . if @xmath106 , @xmath7 is the equilibrium distribution of a single level system .",
    "this implies that @xmath106 coincides with a quasistatic process control , i.  e. , to drive a artificial nanodevice from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state .",
    "consequently , the parameter @xmath51 quantifies how far the system differs from the quasistatic limit .",
    "in order to extent these investigations to large systems , we consider the simplest case , in which a system with @xmath107 sites and energies @xmath108 interacts with a particle reservoir at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "particles can only enter or leave each level and we assume that no transitions between site @xmath109 and site @xmath110 take place .",
    "thus , the internal energy of the system is given by an additive principle , @xmath111 , and the time - derivative of @xmath112 yields @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "in this special case the application of the variational analysis presented in section  [ sec : calculation ] is straightforward , in order to get the optimal setup of large systems .",
    "this fails if we allow an exchange of particle between site @xmath109 and site @xmath110 .",
