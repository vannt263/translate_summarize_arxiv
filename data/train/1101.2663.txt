    "nuclear power plants are the most intense man - controlled sources of neutrinos . with an average energy of",
    "about 200 mev released per fission and 6 neutrinos produced along the @xmath0-decay chain of the fission products , one expects some @xmath5 @xmath6 emitted in a @xmath7 solid angle from a 1 gw reactor ( thermal power ) . since unstable fission products are neutron - rich nuclei all @xmath0-decays are of @xmath8 type and the neutrino flux is actually pure electronic antineutrinos ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these unique features have been exploited by several neutrino oscillations experiments  @xcite .",
    "improvement in the accuracy of @xmath9 spectra is motivated by next generation experiments  @xcite aiming at unprecedented sensitivity to the last unknown mixing angle @xmath10 .",
    "the value of this parameter may determine the future trend of the neutrino physics , in particular for the search of cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "recent developments of compact ( 1 m@xmath11 target scale ) @xmath9 detectors as new safeguard tools for the monitoring of reactors  @xcite would also benefit from an accurate description of @xmath9 spectra .    in a reactor core , only 1 neutron among the",
    "few generated by the fission of a @xmath2u nucleus should induce another fission , so that the core never reaches the over - critical regime .",
    "a fraction of the neutrons is actually captured by the dominant @xmath1u isotope leading to the production of new fissile isotopes : @xmath3pu and to a lesser extent @xmath4pu . when operating , a core is thus burning @xmath2u and accumulating @xmath3pu .",
    "this is the so - called burnup process . in a pressurized water reactor ,",
    "fission rates from both isotopes become comparable at the end of a cycle .",
    "the remaining fissions of @xmath4pu and fast neutron induced fissions of @xmath1u share about 10% of the reactor power . as a result",
    ", the accurate prediction of the @xmath9 spectrum of a reactor requires following the time evolution of these four isotopes , as well as the knowledge of the associated @xmath0-spectra of their neutron - rich fission products .",
    "this paper presents an improved treatment of the latter piece of information , common to the prediction of the @xmath9 spectrum of any moderated reactor .",
    "this work was triggered by the current effort of precision measurement of reactor neutrinos in the double chooz collaboration  @xcite .",
    "our approach combines the assets of the two main methods used so far .",
    "the first method is the so - called `` _ ab initio _",
    "approach '' where the @xmath9 spectrum associated with one of the 4 fissioning isotopes is computed as the sum of the contributions from all fission products .",
    "this requires a huge amount of information on the thousands of @xmath0-branches involved and the weighting factors of fission products , the fission yields .",
    "section  [ sec : ingredients ] presents details on the ingredients of the _ ab initio _ approach while section  [ sec : micro_comp ] gives an update of _ ab initio _ calculations combining all data available today .",
    "the main systematic errors are discussed and a prediction of @xmath1u spectra is given since this isotope is the only one with no integral beta spectrum measured yet .",
    "the second method relies on reference electron spectra  @xcite measured at the high flux ill reactor in grenoble ( france ) using a high resolution magnetic spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "it is presented in section  [ sec : conversion ] where we explain how these electron spectra are converted into antineutrino spectra with incomplete knowledge of the underlying physical distribution of @xmath0-branches .",
    "we show how our `` mixed - approach '' can improve the control of systematic errors and lead to a significant correction of the reference neutrino spectra used by all oscillation experiments so far .",
    "finally we discuss in section  [ sec : reactornuexp ] our results in the context of neutrino reactor experiments .",
    "in the present work we describe the total @xmath0 spectrum emitted by a reactor as the sum of the contributions from the four fissioning nuclei mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] [ eq : stot ] s_(e)&=&_k = ^235 , ^238 , ^239 , ^241 _",
    "ks_k(e ) where @xmath12 is the number of fissions of the @xmath13 isotope at the considered time , @xmath14 is the corresponding @xmath0 spectrum normalized to one fission and @xmath15 is the kinetic energy of emitted electrons .",
    "most of the equations below can be found in textbooks but they are useful here to define our notations and discuss the systematic errors in the following sections . in the _ ab initio _",
    "approach , @xmath14 is broken up into the sum of contributions from all fission products .",
    "[ eq : sk ] s_k(e)&=&_fp=1^n_fp_fp(t)s_fp(e ) where @xmath16 is the activity of the @xmath17 fission product at time @xmath18 and normalized to one fission of isotope `` @xmath19 '' .",
    "then the spectrum @xmath20 of each fission product is itself a sum of @xmath21 @xmath0-branches connecting the ground state ( or in some cases an isomeric state ) of the parent nucleus to different excited levels of the daughter nucleus [ eq : sfp ] s_fp(e)&=&_b=1^n_b br_fp^bs_fp^b(z_fp , a_fp , e_0fp^b , e ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the branching ratio and the endpoint energy of the @xmath24 branch of the @xmath17 fission product respectively . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the charge and atomic number of the parent nucleus .",
    "the sum of the branching ratios is normalized to the @xmath0-decay partial width of the parent nucleus ( @xmath27 if the parent is a pure @xmath8 emitter , @xmath28 otherwise )",
    ".    equations ( [ eq : stot ] ) to ( [ eq : sfp ] ) are valid for both electron and antineutrino spectra .",
    "the expression of the electron spectrum of the @xmath24 branch is given by the product of the following terms [ eq : sfpb ] s_fp^b & = & _ _ _ + & & _ _ to obtain the corresponding expression for the antineutrino spectrum one can safely neglect the nucleus recoil , and replace in the above formula the electron energy @xmath15 by the antineutrino energy [ eq : econserv ] e_&= & e_0fp^b - e by definition this one - to - one relation is valid only at the single @xmath0-branch level .",
    "thus this is a unique feature of the _ ab initio _ approach to predict electron and antineutrino spectra with the same precision .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath29 of eq.([eq : sfpb ] ) is calculated so that the integral @xmath30 .",
    "hence the contribution to the integral of @xmath20 is driven by the branching ratio , as it should be .",
    "the next two terms come from the fermi theory .",
    "the fermi function @xmath31 corrects for the deceleration of the electron in the coulomb field created by the @xmath32 positive charge of the parent nucleus .",
    "therefore in the case of @xmath8 decay the fermi function causes the electron spectrum to start at a non zero value at zero kinetic energy .",
    "this corresponds to a sharp step at the endpoint energy for the antineutrino spectrum , leading to discontinuities when summing several branches of different endpoints .",
    "the shape factor @xmath33 brings extra energy dependence beyond the trivial phase space factor of the fermi theory , due to the nuclear matrix element connecting the two nuclear levels of the @xmath0-decay .",
    "its complexity depends on the forbiddenness of the transition , driven by the spin - parity of the connected levels . in the case of allowed transitions",
    "@xmath33 is a constant and is absorbed in the normalization factor .    for accurate predictions one must also take into account corrections , represented by the @xmath34 factor in eq.([eq : delta ] ) .",
    "this term is threefold [ eq : delta ] _",
    "fp^b(z_fp , a_fp , e ) = _ qed(e ) & + & a_c(z_fp , a_fp)e + & + & a_we the @xmath35 term corrects for radiation of real and virtual photons by the charged fermion lines of the @xmath0-decay vertex . its expression has been calculated at order @xmath36 by sirlin _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the fact that only the charged fermions radiate photons implies that the @xmath35 formula differs for electron and antineutrino spectra , the electron spectrum deviating more from the shape predicted by lowest order calculation than that of the antineutrino . strictly speaking , eq.([eq : econserv ] )",
    "now becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the energy of the radiated photon .",
    "still the @xmath38 spectrum goes like @xmath39 and the dominant contribution comes from soft ( @xmath40 ) radiated photons .",
    "therefore the total energy of the lepton pair remains very close to @xmath41 .",
    "the physical constraint of conservation of the number of particles is fulfilled by the equality [ eq : int_delta ] _ 0^e_0",
    "s_fp^b&(&e_e ) ( 1 + _ qed^e(e))de_e = + & & _ 0^e_0 s_fp^b(e _ ) ( 1+_qed^(e))de_which we verified numerically . the @xmath42 term is a coulomb correction induced by the finite size of the decaying nucleus .",
    "it is related to the interference of @xmath43 and @xmath44 matrix elements , where r is the nuclear radius and @xmath45 the spin operator . in the following we use the approximate expression derived by vogel  @xcite [ eq : a_c ] a_c & = & - and the elton formula  @xcite as an estimate of nuclear radii .",
    "the nucleon itself also has a finite size and as a consequence the expression of its weak current deviates from that of a point - like particle .",
    "the complex effects of the nucleon internal structure can be absorbed in the definition of factors in front of each term of the most general nucleon weak current allowed by the symmetries of the theory .",
    "the equivalent in the electromagnetic sector is the introduction of the pauli ( @xmath46 ) and dirac ( @xmath47 ) form factors of the nucleon , with the @xmath47 contribution proportional to the momentum transfer .",
    "the @xmath48 term contains the cvc partner contribution of @xmath47 in the vector weak current and is called the weak magnetism correction .",
    "again we choose as a reference expression the one derived by vogel  @xcite [ eq : a_w ] a_w & = & - with @xmath49 the neutron disintegration constant and @xmath50 mev the nucleon mass .",
    "one recognizes the @xmath51 term proportional to @xmath47 at small ( @xmath52 ) square momentum transfer .",
    "other expressions of @xmath42 and @xmath48 can be found in the litterature  @xcite .",
    "the associated uncertainty is large and amplified by a sign compensation between the two terms .",
    "the net effect of these finite size corrections and its final error are discussed in sections  [ sec : micro_comp ] and  [ sec : conversion ] .",
    "in principle the ultimate prediction of the @xmath53 spectra comes from the knowledge of all quantities involved in equations ( [ eq : sk ] ) to ( [ eq : sfpb ] ) .",
    "the first attempts at such _ ab initio _ approach were theoretical  @xcite .",
    "most of these calculations use rather crude models to describe the hundreds of involved nuclei but their goal is a correct description of total fission spectra @xmath53 , not individual @xmath0-transitions .",
    "efforts have also been put recently in comparing microscopic models , mostly theoretical models based on qrpa and the nuclear shell model , in the framework of double beta decay studies @xcite . whereas these microscopic models are the ones susceptible to give the most reliable predictions , they are still difficult to apply to large sets of nuclei , especially heavy nuclei ( such as the large mass region of the fission products ) because of the large model spaces required . the estimation of the error associated to theoretical predictions remains a difficult task and in practice they are supplanted by measurements performed in the 80 s at the ill high flux reactor in grenoble  @xcite .",
    "only the @xmath1u spectrum remained calculated  @xcite since no related data exist yet .",
    "nevertheless a measurement in the fast neutron flux of the frmii reactor in garching has lately been performed  @xcite and should be published soon .",
    "we describe here a complementary _ ab initio _ approach with the strategy of exploiting all data available in modern nuclear databases while reducing the input of nuclear models .",
    "the total spectrum @xmath53 of each fissioning isotope is built up according to the equations of section  [ sec : ingredients ] , retrieving the information on all @xmath0-branches from the ensdf nuclear database  @xcite .",
    "the motivations for such an approach are that when all parameters of a @xmath0-branch are known the neutrino branch is also known in a model - independent way and all errors on the input parameters can in principle be propagated .",
    "we have developed an interface with the ensdf data library to read the relevant parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sfp ] ) and ( [ eq : sfpb ] ) and their experimental error .",
    "the forbiddenness of a @xmath0-transition is deduced from the spin and parity of the connected nuclear levels . in cases",
    "when this information is missing or uncomplete , the lowest possible forbiddenness is chosen by default .",
    "all transitions tagged as forbidden are then forced to be of unique type and the corresponding expressions of the shape factors @xmath33 are polynomials in the electron and antineutrino momenta taken from  @xcite .",
    "using our homemade code bestiole , all the above approximations used for the calculation of each branch are tagged and various scenarios can be tested to estimate the error envelope of the final predicted spectrum . from eqs.([eq : sfp ] ) and ( [ eq : sfpb ] ) the electron and antineutrino spectra of each fission product are computed and stored in a database .    then the total beta spectrum of one fissioning isotope is built as the sum of all fission fragment spectra weighted by their activity ( eq.[eq : sk ] ) .",
    "these activities are determined using a simulation package called mcnp utility for reactor evolution ( mure  @xcite ) .",
    "mure is a precision code written in c++ which automates the preparation and computation of successive mcnp ( monte - carlo n - particle transport code  @xcite ) calculations either for precision burn - up or thermal - hydraulics purpose .",
    "it is open - source , portable , and available at nea @xcite and constitutes an efficient tool for non - proliferation and thermal power scenario studies ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "u fissions ( blue solid curve ) .",
    "units are arbitrary and oscillation effects are suppressed .",
    "the detected rate rises from the threshold value at about 1.8 mev , reaches a maximum around 4 mev and vanishes after 8 mev .",
    "this shape is the result of folding the emitted spectrum ( black dashed - dotted curve ) , parameterization taken from section [ subsec : param ] and beta - inverse cross section ( red dashed curve ) . ]",
    "the detection process , common to many reactor antineutrino experiments , is the @xmath0-inverse reaction on a free proton [ eq : beta_inv ] + p e^+ + n which sets an energy threshold for the antineutrino of 1.804 mev , the mass difference between the initial and final states ( see figure [ fig : detspec ] ) .",
    "therefore the lowest energy part of the @xmath0 spectra , below this threshold , is not addressed here . in this region ,",
    "equilibrium is reached only after several months , requiring the control of significant transient effects when considering shorter irradiation times .",
    "extra effects like the low energy @xmath0-decays induced by neutron capture on @xmath1u and fission products  @xcite would also have to be treated . on the high energy side , antineutrino rates above 8",
    "mev become negligible ( @xmath54 of total detected rate ) .",
    "this part of the spectrum is dominated by the very energetic ( high @xmath55 ) transitions of rare exotic nuclei and can not be accurately predicted .",
    "thus the intermediate energy range resulting from the observation of the detected spectrum in figure [ fig : detspec ] turns out to be favorable to the control of the systematic errors of the predictions of reactor antineutrino spectra .",
    "a powerful test of our calculations is the comparison with the reference electron spectra from ill  @xcite .",
    "such a consistency check gives valuable insight into the distribution of the numerous @xmath0-branches , pointing to the main source of errors in the determination of the antineutrino spectra .",
    "considering all the data available in the ensdf data library , the predicted @xmath0-spectra associated with the fission of @xmath2u and @xmath3pu are compared with the reference ill data in figure  [ fig : u235_abs ] .",
    "u and @xmath3pu reference electron spectra from  @xcite with our predictions based on the _ ab initio _ approach .",
    "the predictions have no free parameters and the rates are normalized to one fission . ]",
    "although the spectrum falls quickly with energy , reasonable agreement is found on the shape and absolute normalization over a quite large energy range .",
    "note that our prediction is parameter free . for finer analysis",
    "the residues of our predicted @xmath2u spectrum with respect to reference data are shown as the dashed - dotted line in figure  [ fig : u235_abinit ] .",
    "it reveals a @xmath56 10% oscillation pattern of the calculations around the data up to 7.5 mev and a large overestimation at higher energy .",
    "this overestimation points to the well known systematic effect of pandemonium  @xcite . indeed branching ratios and endpoints",
    "are usually determined by measuring the intensity and energy of @xmath57-radiations emitted subsequently to the @xmath0 transition using high resolution but low efficiency ge crystals . in the case of large @xmath55 a fraction of the beta branches connects the parent nucleus to very excited levels of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the strength of the associated low energy @xmath0-rays is either spread over multiple weak @xmath57-rays or concentrated in one high energy gamma ray . in both cases part or all",
    "the @xmath57-cascade can be missed by the measurement apparatus . as a result",
    "low endpoint transitions are often missed and high endpoints are given too much weight in the global decay scheme of the parent nucleus .",
    "to correct for the pandemonium effect we tried to gather @xmath0-decay data using other experimental techniques than the @xmath58 coincidence .",
    "a valuable set of data comes from the measurement campaign undertaken by tengblad _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the late eighties at the on - line isotopes separators isolde , at cern , geneva , and osiris at the neutron research laboratory , studsvik .",
    "some 111 fission products , selected as the main contributors to the high energy part of reactor beta spectra ( 90% above 6 mev ) were measured .",
    "electron spectra were recorded independently from the emitted gamma rays .",
    "this prevented sensitivity to the pandemonium effect but at the same time part of the information on single @xmath0-branches was lost . among the 111 measured electron spectra ,",
    "44 were found in perfect agreement with the spectra predicted from the ensdf database .",
    "the remaining 67 were then replaced in our database .",
    "u electron spectra computed as the difference of our _ ab initio _ calculations minus reference data from  @xcite divided by reference data .",
    "dashed - dotted curve : ensdf data only ; dashed curve : some ensdf data replaced by pandemonium corrected data ; solid curve : unmeasured @xmath0 emitters are added on top of previous curve , using the gross - theory calculations of the jendl nuclear database and few remaining exotic nuclei described by our model ( see text ) . ]    another important source of data are the measurements based on total absorption gamma spectrometers ( tags ) .",
    "the principle here is to implant the radioactive isotope on a foil surrounded by high efficiency gamma detectors able to collect the whole @xmath57-cascade following the beta - decay .",
    "the distribution of total @xmath57 energies gives access to the beta - strength of the studied isotope at the cost of a deconvolution analysis taking into account the full response of the apparatus .",
    "eventually a complete beta - decay scheme can be determined providing the relevant beta - branch information for electron and antineutrino spectra .",
    "thus the 29 nuclei of r. greenwood _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured at the inel facility , idaho , were incorporated in our database .",
    "a.  algora and j.  l.  tain studied carefully both tengblad et al .",
    "and greenwood et al.s measurements  @xcite .",
    "both may be affected by several sources of systematic effects which are difficult to quantify .",
    "in particular both measurements of @xmath59rb beta decay mean energy differ by more than 350 kev , while the @xmath59rb decay scheme was used in tengblad et al.s analysis to quantify the @xmath57-ray detector absolute efficiency .",
    "if the @xmath59rb decay scheme is affected by the pandemonium effect , tengblad et al.s data sets may exhibit an overall systematic effect .",
    "a new tags measurement of the decay properties of @xmath59rb has recently been performed at the jyvskyl university facility @xcite , and will help addressing the uncertainties associated to both sets of measurements . in cases when a fission product was present in both data sets ( 8 nuclei only ) , giving the priority to greenwood _",
    "s or tengblad _ et al _ s measurements changes the predicted spectrum by 3% at most in the 4 - 5 mev range , the effect drops at the 1% level or below elsewhere . in the following priority",
    "is arbitrarily given to tengblad _",
    "et al _ s data .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig : u235_abinit ] shows the electron residues after merging our ensdf based database with the above selected spectra supposedly corrected for the pandemonium effect . as expected",
    "the high energy part of our prediction has been significantly reduced leading to negative residues of increasing amplitude with energy .",
    "this indicates that a large part of the pandemonium effect is probably corrected and that contributions from the missing unknown transitions of exotic nuclei grow rapidly with energy .    to fill up this missing contribution",
    "we collected all available predictions of electron spectra from the jendl nuclear database @xcite .",
    "these predictions are based on the `` gross theory of beta decay '' @xcite and were included in the jendl database to supplement ensdf data showing incomplete level schemes or for nuclei for which no data were available .",
    "the estimated spectra were stored in the jendl file so as to keep the consistency between the average decay energy value derived from the spectrum and that used for decay heat analysis @xcite .",
    "the calculated spectra were also compared with the directly measured spectra from the reference @xcite and revealed to be in very good agreement .",
    "the total contribution of the jendl electron spectra , not already included in the ensdf and pandemonium corrected data , was computed and converted to its associated total antineutrino spectrum following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "finally the few remaining nuclei were described using a model based on fits of the distributions of the end - points and branching ratios in the ensdf database , then extrapolated to the exotic nuclei .",
    "the result is the solid curve in figure  [ fig : u235_abinit ] showing flattened residues within a global envelope of @xmath56 10% over the whole energy range .",
    "this best agreement with the ill reference data is actually valid for the @xmath3pu isotope .",
    "depending on the considered fissionning isotope , this new compilation of @xmath0-decay data includes about 845 nuclei and 10000 @xmath0-branches , about 525 nuclei come from the ensdf and pandemonium corrected data , 285 from the jendl database and 35 from our model .",
    "it represents the best data set for _ ab initio _ calculation .      from this work",
    "we conclude that a compilation of all available data on the beta - decays of fission products can describe the antineutrino fission spectra at the 10% level , illustrating the tremendous experimental work already achieved .",
    "still , the relatively large energy range of detected antineutrino involves a sizeable contribution of unstable and poorly known nuclei in the total spectrum . under these conditions , improving errors or even reaching the accuracy of the ill reference spectra seems to require another fair amount of experimental effort . for applications like the determination of reactors",
    "decay heat calculations , a short list of `` pandemonium candidates '' to be remeasured with total absorption techniques has been identified  @xcite .",
    "completion of a corrected beta - decay database is in progress ( see for instance  @xcite ) with more and more refined analyses  @xcite .",
    "thanks to our database of fission product spectra , we have established a list of nuclei , contributing importantly to different energy bins of the antineutrino energy spectra from @xmath2u and @xmath3pu , and that could be affected by the pandemonium effect",
    ". it will be the subject of a forthcoming publication . from this list",
    "we have selected a few nuclei which are amenable to experimental investigation using the tags technique , which can provide the beta intensity distribution in the full decay window eliminating the pandemonium effect .",
    "it appeared that some fission products being part of the measurement priority list selected for reactor decay heat assessment @xcite , also belong to the list of important contributors to the antineutrino emission in the energy window of interest for neutrino oscillation studies .",
    "recent and on - going experimental efforts carried out in the field of reactor physics , neutrino physics but also of interest for nuclear structure and astrophysics will certainly allow to reduce the uncertainties associated to the reactor antineutrino spectra computed through the ab - initio method in the very next years @xcite .",
    "we describe below the estimated error budget of our _ ab initio _ calculations and give a prediction of electron and antineutrino spectra of @xmath1u . in the perspective of neutrino oscillation",
    "analyses the @xmath2u and @xmath3pu isotopes , which contribute to about 90% of a nuclear reactor spectrum , are predicted using a more accurate method presented in section [ sec : conversion ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the control of the parameters of all single @xmath0-branches allows a full propagation of the errors quoted in the ensdf database .",
    "all sources of error are treated as independent and the total error matrix of rates in energy bins is computed . in the simpler case of a spectrum at equilibrium , the activity of each fission product is approximated by the associated cumulative fission yield indexed in the jeff3.1.1 database  @xcite .",
    "then the uncertainty on branching ratios and fission yields can be propagated analytically while the uncertainty on end - points is propagated numerically ( it turns out to have a negligible contribution ) .",
    "the dominant contribution of normalization errors induces large correlations between proximate bins as illustrated in table  [ tab : correlmatrix ] .",
    "note that these correlations are valid only for the specific part of the measurement errors quoted in the nuclear databases .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tab : micro_errors ] we know from the above section that systematic effects beyond these databases are dominant and will change these correlations in a non - trivial way as long as all @xmath0-branches are not corrected .",
    ".correlation matrix in the range 2 to 3.5 mev in 250 kev bins obtained by propagating all sources of errors in ensdf and jeff databases .",
    "branching - ratio errors cause a very high level of correlation then reduced by the end - point distribution and assumption of independent fission yields . [",
    "tab : correlmatrix ] [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      error bars and the @xmath60 per degree of freedom . in the right panels we show the residual of the fits . ]      the ill spectra were acquired after a quite short irradiation time in a quasi pure thermal neutron flux , between 12 hours and 1.8 days depending on the measured isotopes . for neutrino reactor experiments",
    "the irradiation time scale would rather be a reactor cycle duration , typically 1 year . among the fission products ,",
    "about 10% of them have a @xmath0-decay life - time long enough to keep accumulating after several days some of them presenting sufficient large capture cross sections to possibly affect the final inventory .",
    "moreover , in a standard pwr , the neutron energy spectrum exhibits more important epithermal and fast neutron energy components than in the ill measurements .",
    "these higher energy components of the neutron flux add small contributions to the fissions of @xmath2u ( as well as for the other fissioning isotopes ) leading to different distributions of the fission products . in this section",
    "we study the effect of these phenomena on the reference neutrino spectra and compute the associated corrections .",
    "since these corrections are relative deviations between spectra at different irradiation times , we assume they are pretty insensitive to the sources of error of our _ ab initio _ calculations discussed in section  [ sec : micro_comp ] .",
    "therefore the study was done with the mure simulation of a pwr assembly of n4 type exhibiting a moderation ratio equal to the one of a pwr core in order to represent the full reactor neutronic conditions .",
    "the infinite multiplication coefficient of the simulation has been successfully compared with similar simulations performed with the deterministic code dragon for french pwrs @xcite .",
    "this simulation represents thus very well the real physical conditions of a reactor core .",
    "condition of a constant power is assumed , renormalizing the neutron flux at each time step in order to compensate for the fuel burnup .",
    "we adapted the code in order to compute and store the amount of all @xmath8 emitters produced over time @xcite . in our simulation ,",
    "the fission yields from the jeff3.1.1 nuclear data library @xcite were used .",
    "the yields coming from the 25  mev , 400  kev and 14  mev libraries were weighted by the fission rates in each neutron energy region .",

    "as expected , the accumulation of long - lived nuclei shows up as positive deviations which amplitude decreases with the neutrino energy and becomes negligible above 3.5 mev . at the threshold of the beta - inverse process it takes about 100 days of irradiations for the antineutrino spectrum to be stable at the 1% level . noting that the irradiation time for the reference spectrum of @xmath63 is 12  h instead of 36  h for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the corrections are similar for all isotopes .",
    "we checked with our evolution codes that the effects of neutron capture on the fission products as well as the contribution of the neutron spectrum above the thermal energy domain have small impact on the off - equilibrium corrections .",
    "other tests have been performed with the fispact code , showing that these results may depend on the system ( neutron , flux and energy spectrum , geometry ) used in the calculation .",
    "the error envelop covering our different results is of 30% on the total off - equilibrium corrections .",
    "therefore the results quoted in table  [ tab : off_eq2 ] should be taken as typical corrections at a n4 reactor . for applications with signicantly different neutron flux or fuel geometry ,",
    "dedicated simulations should be carried out for an accurate correction of the lowest energy bins of the antineutrino spectrum .    u antineutrino spectrum for different irradiation times with respect to a reference spectrum considered at equilibrium . ]",
    "off - equilibrium effects have independently been evaluated for the analysis of the chooz experiment  @xcite , which measured the neutrino spectrum of the two n4 reactors of the chooz site . in this reference ,",
    "the departure from the antineutrino ill spectra were computed using the cumulative yields of some known long - lived fission fragments .",
    "the results are shown as markers in figure  [ fig : offeqeffects ] to be compared with the histograms of our calculations .",
    "the overall agreement is good , even when evolving the spectrum back to irradiation time as short as @xmath66  s , where the corrections become quite large and have steep variations in time .",
    "note that our reference spectrum at equilibrium does not use cumulative yields .",
    "instead it is computed by our evolution code using independent fission yields and a long irradiation time . in the analysis of cumulative yields",
    "it is in fact assumed that all nuclei have reached equilibrium .",
    "this is fully justified for short lived fission products , whereas there is some ambiguity with the decay products of longest half - lives . to avoid apparent double counting of the cumulative yields of the daughters ,",
    "some very long - lived decays have been removed from the cumulative yield databases but some are still present in the libraries . because of these problems , it is recommended by nuclear databases  @xcite as a safer method to use independent yields with an inventory code .",
    "we have considered 450 days of irradiation as our reference to account for a spectrum that would have reached quasi - equilibrium .",
    "in addition , this duration corresponds to a typical irradiation time of a fuel assembly in a pwr core .",
    "off - equilibrium effects where also computed in  @xcite where the authors used beta branches of 571 fission fragments .",
    "the fission yield were taken from  @xcite and beta decay properties came from experimental data .",
    "our results are compatible with theirs considering the quoted uncertainties and the possible discrepancies in the neutron energy spectrum and flux used in the calculations .",
    "note also that small additional discrepancies could arise from the smaller number of fission products used in the calculation of kopeikin et  al .",
    "+ in conclusion , our new reference spectra presented in section [ sec : conversion ] are , strictly speaking , valid only for irradiation times comparable to the ones used at ill for their measurement . for longer irradiations , corrections to these spectra are listed in table [ tab : off_eq2 ] .",
    "the above comparison between independent estimates suggest that the systematic errors associated to these corrections are at the sub - percent level relative to the total antineutrino spectrum .",
    "the new conversion of the ill data described in section  [ sec : conversion ] leads to a 2.5% increase of the detected antineutrino flux while the predicted shape is basically unchanged .",
    "the impact of this correction on the analysis of published measurements of antineutrino oscillations at reactor is discussed by the authors in a separate article  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of forthcoming reactor experiments is also updated in this context .",
    "using all available data on fission yields and beta decays of fission products we have shown that _ ab initio _ calculations of total beta spectra agreed with the reference ill beta spectra at the 10  % level , illustrating the tremendous amount of nuclear data collected today . from this work we gave a prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with",
    "the fission of @xmath1u with estimated relative uncertainty increasing from 10 to 20% with energy in the 2 - 8 mev range . since this isotope contributes to about 10% of the total fission rate of a reactor such",
    "a prediction is valuable .",
    "however , for the dominant isotopes , the remaining systematic errors of nuclear databases as well as the contribution of poorly known beta transitions still prevent the _ ab initio _ approach from any use for high precision neutrino oscillation experiments at reactors .",
    "+ this motivated the development of a new mixed - approach combining the accurate reference of the ill electron spectra with the physical distribution of beta branches provided by the nuclear databases .",
    "we presented how this method gets rid of the main systematic error of the _ ab initio _ approach allowing a better control of the conversion of reference electron spectra into antineutrino spectra .",
    "while the final error budget ended up being comparable to previous reference work @xcite , we demonstrated that the antineutrino spectra emitted by the fission of @xmath2u , @xmath3pu and @xmath4pu isotopes have to be corrected for a systematic shift of about 3% in normalization .",
    "this net effect was presented as the combination of an improved implementation of finite size corrections to the fermi theory plus a more realistic description of the distribution of @xmath0-branches .",
