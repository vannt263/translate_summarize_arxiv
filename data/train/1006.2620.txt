    "physical , sociological or biological surveys often lead to data presented as contingency tables .",
    "these surveys aim at studying relationships such as total , mutual , partial or conditional independence between several characters in a population .",
    "table notations are very useful to formulate the test and make the corresponding hypotheses explicit , but can be cumbersome when the number of characters exceeds three . for theoretical results , we therefore use vector notations instead , and",
    "we reformulate the independence test as a multinomial goodness of fit test .",
    "let @xmath2 be a probability vector of dimension @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total number of cross - classifying categories .",
    "let @xmath5 be the sample size and @xmath6 the vector of observed frequencies , realization of @xmath7 with distribution @xmath8 , multinomial distribution with parameters @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the probability vector under the null hypothesis and consider the following test : @xmath11    popular goodness of fit statistics include pearson s chi - square statistic @xmath0 and kullback s minimum discrimination information statistic @xmath1 , defined in  @xcite . for two probability distributions @xmath9 and @xmath12 , these are written : @xmath13 and @xmath14 they belong to the power divergence statistics family @xmath15 defined by read and cressie in @xcite , respectively for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where : @xmath18.\\ ] ] for a review on goodness of fit testing methods and statistics , see @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath10 is not always completely specified .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is a known function of an unknown parameter @xmath19 of @xmath20 with @xmath21 , and denote @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "we suppose that the functions @xmath24 we consider here are bijective and estimate @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath19 .",
    "as the probability @xmath9 is generally unknown , we also estimate the @xmath28 for @xmath29 in @xmath30 by their maximum likelihood estimators @xmath31 . throughout this paper , underlying indexes",
    "@xmath5 are omitted for simplicity of notation , and we consider the statistics @xmath32 and @xmath33    read and cressie show that under birch s regularity conditions , see @xcite , the statistics @xmath34 are asymptotically equivalent and share a common chi - square limit distribution :    [ asymp ] @xmath35    this implies the following result :    @xmath36    this asymptotic result is a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "classical empirical limitations include that the sample size @xmath5 must be over  @xmath37 and that all expected frequencies must be over @xmath38 .",
    "usually @xmath39 is preferred to @xmath32 because it is less sensitive to small cell frequencies .",
    "read and cressie recommend the use of @xmath40 instead for @xmath41 and a minimum expected frequency over @xmath42 .",
    "sometimes , even the lower bound @xmath43 is accepted for the expected frequencies .",
    "a review on these conditions can be found in @xcite .",
    "when there are too few subjects in the study or when the classifying categories are too numerous , the table comprises one or several empty cells called random zeros .",
    "the table is then called sparse and it is likely that at least one cell has an expected frequency below @xmath43 .",
    "random zeros would not appear if the sample was of sufficient size .",
    "structural zeros , corresponding to cells with an expected probability of zero , are not considered here and should be suppressed .",
    "we therefore assume that the following condition is satisfied : @xmath44    sparse tables can nonetheless be tested for independence , for example by regrouping cells so that the condition on the expected frequencies is satisfied .",
    "however this procedure is not always data relevant .",
    "fisher s exact test given in @xcite applies without restrictions , except that it becomes numerically unmanageable when the table dimension grows .",
    "this leads to the use of monte carlo simulation methods as explained in @xcite .",
    "the approach we propose here consists in correcting the historical statistics @xmath32 and @xmath39 according to the number of zero cells , by generalizing and improving a method designed by ku in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 be the random variable giving the number of zeros in the vector or the contingency table , and @xmath46 a realization of @xmath45 with @xmath47 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath48 and that @xmath49 for all @xmath50 in @xmath51 . the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath52 underestimates the @xmath53 for @xmath54 in @xmath55 and overestimates the @xmath56 for @xmath57 in @xmath58 .",
    "its use when @xmath59 thus has consequences on the statistics @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",
    "ku argues in @xcite that @xmath39 tends to inflate with respect to @xmath32 when @xmath45 grows .",
    "he then proposes to subtract  @xmath42 from @xmath39 for each zero , that is @xmath46 in total .",
    "he proves the asymptotic equivalence between @xmath39 and its corrected version only for @xmath60 .",
    "i will explain why his reasoning is inconsistent .",
    "first , he considers a new statistic which is not a member of the power divergence family .",
    "moreover , he uses the straightforward lemma [ lem1 ] to deduce the approximation : @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , despite the fact that @xmath65 and @xmath66 is not bounded .",
    "[ lem1 ] for each @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , @xmath69 and the quantities @xmath66 and @xmath70 are bounded , we have : @xmath71    the expression on the left in is null whereas the one on the right is negative .",
    "the sum over @xmath29 of the left - hand side gives @xmath39 and we recognize @xmath32 in the sum of the right - hand side .",
    "however , unlike ku seems to think , zero and non - zero cells tend to compensate for each other and the approximation can not be extended to the corresponding sum .",
    "there is therefore no behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath0 that we can deduce from this .",
    "finally , he illustrates this asymptotic result on a small sample of size @xmath72 .",
    "we propose new corrections for both statistics , based on ku s correction and a likelihood inequality that we present in the next subsection .",
    "let us consider the following inequality coming from a likelihood reasoning : the sample vector we observe can be thought of more likely to happen than any other possible vector , since it is the one we actually observed . with exactly @xmath46 zeros and @xmath73 non - zero cells observed ,",
    "so for all @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath78    we give in proposition [ condition ] a sufficient condition on the @xmath79 for to be satisfied , and prove this statement in appendix [ app ] .    [ condition ] the inequality is satisfied under the following assumption : @xmath80      we propose an estimator @xmath81 for @xmath9 , different from the maximum likelihood estimator , with the following form : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are random variables depending on @xmath5 designed to compensate for the under- and overestimations due to @xmath85 .",
    "we thus take them positive with @xmath86 , such that @xmath87 inflates the modified maximum likelihood estimator @xmath88 and such that @xmath89 controls the related rise .",
    "this new probability vector allows us to define corrected statistics @xmath90 and @xmath91 , provided that the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath89 satisfy several conditions . forcing",
    "the summation of the @xmath93 to @xmath42 implies that @xmath94 , and thus allows us to define @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 such that :    @xmath98    note that for @xmath99 , we fix @xmath65 and @xmath100 .    before considering the other conditions on @xmath97 , let us first give some notations .",
    "let @xmath101 be @xmath102 and @xmath103 be @xmath104 let @xmath105 stand for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "we dismiss the uniformly distributed case where : @xmath109 thus guaranteeing that @xmath105 and @xmath107 are positive .",
    "let @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 proposition [ condition ] is applied to @xmath113 together with inequalities @xmath114 , for all @xmath29 in @xmath30 it is then equivalent to these conditions on @xmath115 and @xmath87 : @xmath116 and @xmath117    we want to make a practical choice among possible values of @xmath97 ensuring us that it is as far from @xmath85 as possible .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath87 in quite far from @xmath42 as a convex combination of @xmath118 and @xmath119 with an empirical parameter @xmath120 equal to @xmath121 . for this value of @xmath87",
    "we choose @xmath115 near the upper limit of the interval in , that is : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a small constant designed to eliminate boundary effects .",
    "the final expressions we get for the corrected statistics @xmath124 and @xmath125 of @xmath126 and @xmath127 are : @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath131      in this paragraph , we show the convergence in distribution of @xmath132 and @xmath133 to a chi - square distribution .",
    "let us first study the parameter @xmath87 .",
    "[ propb ] bound @xmath118 is strictly less than @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath134 and @xmath135 when @xmath5 tends to @xmath136 , then @xmath118 and @xmath87 tend to @xmath42 .",
    "inequalities @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 show that all three components of the maximum defining @xmath118 are strictly less than  @xmath42 .",
    "their order @xmath42 developments as @xmath5 tends to @xmath136 give their convergence to  @xmath42 , with the quantities @xmath140 , @xmath73 and @xmath141 bounded .",
    "we also study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath45 , for once denoted @xmath142 , and state the following lemma which proof appears in appendix [ app ] .",
    "[ lem2 ] the number of zeros @xmath142 converges almost surely to @xmath143 as @xmath5 tends to @xmath136 .",
    "we recalled in section [ sec1 ] the convergence of pearson s and kullback s statistics to a chi - square distribution . in theorem",
    "[ thm7 ] , we state a similar property for the corrected statistics @xmath132 and @xmath133 .    [ thm7 ] under birch s regularity conditions in @xcite , the estimator @xmath97 defined by , and is such that : @xmath144    we deduce from lemma [ lem2 ] the existence of a set @xmath145 of probability  @xmath42 on which we can find a rank @xmath146 such that @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "the variable  @xmath115 is then set equal to @xmath143 and the variable @xmath87 equal to @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the estimates @xmath85 and @xmath97 match , so that @xmath149 and @xmath150",
    ". theorem [ asymp ] then completes the proof .",
    "the final two sections are dedicated to proving the relevancy of our corrections through simulations and real data analyses .",
    "in this section , simulations confirm the necessity to correct not only @xmath1 but also @xmath0 .",
    "we compute the statistics @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath151 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 on @xmath152 vectors of length @xmath153 of total frequency @xmath154 for each of the four multinomial distributions defined in table [ type1 ] by @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",

    "a thorough study of the table shows that rare species tend to settle preferentially in oligotrophic rivers .",
    "they are indeed better adapted to this kind of environment which tends to disappear from the rivers in the study . moreover ,",
    "polluo - tolerant species constitute the majority of the vegetables in eutrophic rivers .",
    "a eutrophic environment is competitive and these resistant species tend to get the best of it .",
    "we suggest to compute both @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and to reject the null hypothesis if at least one of them is larger than the chi - square threshold .",
    "our results tend to prove that this approach is relevant and our corrections efficient in sparse tables .",
    "they are all the more interesting for the fact that sparse tables are usually left aside because the hypotheses needed to apply classical chi - square tests are not satisfied .",
