    "in a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath3 , the description of any quantum state @xmath4 generated by a source can be obtained by quantum tomography . for any density matrix @xmath4 , which is hermitian and has trace @xmath5 , @xmath6 independent measurements are sufficient and necessary to uniquely specify @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath7 is a pure state , one may not need as many measurements to uniquely determine @xmath8 . as we will see later",
    ", however , exactly what is meant by `` uniquely '' in this context needs to be specified .",
    "consider a set of @xmath9 linearly independent observables @xmath10 where each @xmath11 is hermitian .",
    "measurements on state @xmath4 with respect to these observables give the following average values @xmath12 we denote the set of these @xmath13 for all states @xmath4 as @xmath14 for a pure state @xmath8 , these values are given by @xmath15 and we denote the set of these values for all pure states @xmath8 as the joint numerical range @xmath16    in this work we consider two different kinds of `` unique determinedness '' for @xmath8 :    1 .",
    "we say @xmath8 is _ uniquely determined among pure states ( udp ) by measuring @xmath17 _ if there does not exist any other pure state which has the same measurement results as those of @xmath8 when measuring @xmath17 .",
    "we say @xmath8 is _ uniquely determined among all states ( uda ) by measuring @xmath17 _ if there does not exist any other state , pure or mixed , which has the same measurement results as those of @xmath8 when measuring @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that there exists a family of @xmath1 observables such that any pure state is udp , in contrast to the @xmath6 observables in the general case of quantum tomography  @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning for this case is clear : it is useful for the purpose of quantum tomography to have the prior knowledge that the state to be reconstructed is pure or nearly pure .",
    "many other techniques for pure state tomography have been developed , and experiments have been performed to demonstrate the reduction of the number of measurements needed  @xcite .",
    "when the state is udp , to make the tomography meaningful , one needs to make sure that the state is indeed pure .",
    "this is not in general practical , but one can readily generalize the above mentioned udp results to low rank states , where the physical constraints ( e.g. , low temperature , locality of interaction ) may ensure that the actual physical state ( which ideally supposed to be pure ) is indeed low rank .",
    "if the state is uda , however , in terms of tomography one do not need to bother with these physical assumptions , because in the event there is only a unique state compatible with the measurement results , which turns out to be pure ( or low rank ) .",
    "there is also another clear physical meaning for the states that are uda by measuring @xmath17 .",
    "consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath18 then any unique ground state @xmath8 of @xmath19 is uda by measuring @xmath17 . this is easy to verify : if there is any other state @xmath4 that gives the same measurement results , then @xmath4 has the same energy as that of @xmath8 , which is the ground state energy .",
    "therefore , any pure state in the range of @xmath4 must also be a ground state , which contradicts the fact that @xmath8 is the unique ground state .",
    "in other words , uda is a necessary condition for @xmath8 to be a unique ground state of @xmath19 .",
    "it is in general not sufficient , but the exceptions are likely rare  @xcite .    the uniqueness properties for pure states , for both udp and uda , have also been studied extensively in the case of multipartite quantum systems , where the observables correspond to reduced density matrices ( rdms ) .",
    "that is , the observables are chosen to act nontrivially on only some subsystems .",
    "for an @xmath20-particle system and a constant @xmath21 , there are a total of @xmath22 @xmath23-rdms , and the corresponding measurements @xmath17 are those @xmath24-body operators .",
    "for example , for a three - qubit system and @xmath25 , one can choose @xmath17 as all the one and two - particle pauli operators .",
    "of course , one can also choose to look at some of the @xmath26-rdms , rather than all of them .",
    "for instance , for a three - particle system , one can look at @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that almost all three - qubit pure states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms  @xcite .",
    "these authors also show that udp implies uda for three - qubit pure states , for @xmath27-rdms .",
    "this result can be further improved to @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "more generally one can consider a three - particle system of particles @xmath30 with hilbert spaces whose dimensions are @xmath31 , respectively . if @xmath32 , then almost all pure states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath33 , then almost all pure states are udp by their @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as shown by diosi @xcite .    for @xmath20-particle quantum systems with equal dimensional subsystems ,",
    "almost all pure states are uda by their @xmath23-rdms of just over half of the parties ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 properly chosen rdms among all the @xmath26 @xmath23-rdms suffice  @xcite .",
    "w - type states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms , and @xmath36 of those @xmath27-rdms are enough  @xcite .",
    "general symmetric dicke states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the only @xmath20-particle pure states which can not be udp by their @xmath37-rdms are those ghz - type states , and the result is further improved to the case of uda  @xcite .",
    "their results also show that udp implies uda for @xmath20-qubit pure states , for @xmath37-rdms .    despite these many results ,",
    "there is no systematic study of these two different types of uniqueness for pure states",
    ". this will be the focus of this paper , where we are interested in knowing for given measurements @xmath17 , whether udp and uda are the same , or are different",
    ". we will give a general argument that there is a gap between the number of observables needed for the two different cases .",
    "however , in many interesting circumstances , they can coincide .",
    "our discussions extend naturally to the case of low rank quantum states instead of just pure states . here",
    "one can also look at two kinds of uniqueness when measuring given observables @xmath17 : one is uniqueness among all low rank states , the other is among all states of any rank .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first show that there is a set of @xmath2 observables that insures every pure state is uda ; which should be compared to the udp result @xmath1 .",
    "thus in general there is a gap between the optimal results for the udp and uda cases , and we illustrate this with some examples . sec .",
    "iii discusses the case of observables corresponding to rdms of a multipartite quantum state , where for the three particle case , we show that if @xmath38 , then almost all pure states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 , improving the bounds given in @xcite .",
    "however this still leaves a gap with the diosi result for the case of udp in @xcite .",
    "we further discuss circumstances where udp can imply uda for all pure states . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that when there are only two independent measurements performed , then udp always implies uda , by making use of convexity of the numerical range of operators . in a more general case ,",
    "if there is a compact group of symmetries of the state space which has the span of the operators measured as its set of fixed points , then udp implies uda for all pure states .",
    "we analyze the possible dimensions for those fixed point sets .",
    "a summary and some discussions are included in sec .",
    "in this section , we discuss the minimum number of observables needed to have all pure states be uda .",
    "we start by choosing a hermitian basis @xmath39 for the operators on @xmath3 . without loss of generality",
    "we choose @xmath40 , the identity operator on @xmath3 , which has trace @xmath0 .",
    "we further require that the @xmath41 s are orthogonal , in the sense that for @xmath42 , @xmath43    the @xmath44 hermitian matrices form a real inner product space with inner product @xmath45 , so such a basis @xmath39 exists for any dimension @xmath0 . for instance , for the qubit case ( @xmath46 ) , we can choose the pauli basis @xmath47    for the qutrit case ( @xmath48 ) , one can choose @xmath49 for @xmath50 , where @xmath51s are the gell - mann matrices given by    @xmath52    for general @xmath0 , one can choose @xmath53 for @xmath50 , where @xmath51s are the generalized gell - man matrices .",
    "we can now write any density operator @xmath4 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and where @xmath56 has real entries .",
    "we have @xmath57 , therefore @xmath58 , and the equality holds if @xmath4 is a pure state . however , not every state satisfying @xmath59 is a pure state .",
    "indeed , @xmath4 is a pure state if and only if @xmath60 , which gives equations that @xmath61 needs to satisfy .",
    "if one of the observables is a multiple of the identity , then we can drop it from the list of observables without affecting uda and udp .",
    "if two states agree on an observable @xmath11 , then they agree on @xmath62 for any real scalar @xmath63 , so we can adjust each of the observables @xmath64 to have trace zero without affecting uda or udp . hence hereafter we assume all @xmath11 are traceless .    for any observable @xmath11 , we can expand in terms of @xmath65 as @xmath66    then the average value of @xmath11 is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 .    to discuss the problem for any pure state to be uda ,",
    "the constant @xmath5 and constant factor @xmath69 can be ignored , as these are the same constants for all states .",
    "therefore we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 means that the average value of @xmath11 for the state @xmath4 is geometrically equivalent to the projection of @xmath61 onto @xmath72 .",
    "alternatively , define @xmath73 by @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the linear subspace of @xmath76 spanned by @xmath77 , and let @xmath78 be the orthogonal projection from @xmath76 onto @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath78 and @xmath79 have the same kernel , namely @xmath80 .",
    "thus for states @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 if and only if @xmath83 , so in considering uda and udp we can treat @xmath79 as being the orthogonal projection onto @xmath75 .    if we subtract the density matrix @xmath84 from all states , then the translated set of states sits in the real @xmath6 dimensional subspace of trace zero hermitian matrices . in this sense",
    ", we are actually working with real geometry in @xmath76 .",
    "all quantum states then sit inside the @xmath6-dimensional unit ball , with pure states corresponding to unit vectors , but not every vector on the unit @xmath85-dimensional sphere is a pure state .",
    "the observables span an @xmath9-dimensional subspace that all the quantum states will be projected onto .",
    "we will simply say the subspace is spanned by @xmath17 when no confusion arises , and we will no longer distinguish an operator @xmath11 from the corresponding vector @xmath86 .",
    "indeed we only consider the real span of @xmath17 , and we denote it by @xmath87 . for each @xmath87 , there is an orthogonal subspace in @xmath76 of dimension @xmath88 , which we denote by @xmath89 .",
    "here we are taking the orthogonal complement in the space of traceless hermitian matrices , so that every @xmath90 is traceless .",
    "we now are ready to state our first theorem .",
    "[ th : uda ] for a @xmath0-dimensional system ( @xmath91 ) , there exists a set of @xmath2 observables for which every pure state is uda .    to see why this is the case , note that in the above - mentioned geometrical picture",
    ", it is clear that a pure state @xmath92 is uda by measuring @xmath17 if there does not exist any operator @xmath90 , such that @xmath93 is positive .",
    "one sufficient condition will then be that any operator @xmath90 has at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues .",
    "we will use this sufficient condition to construct a desired @xmath89 .    in order to construct @xmath89",
    ", we provide a set of @xmath94 linearly independent hermitian matrices @xmath95 explicitly , such that the hermitian matrix @xmath96 has at least two positive eigenvalues for any nonzero real vector @xmath97 .",
    "our construction is motivated by and similar to the diagonal filling technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but along the other direction of the diagonals .",
    "this then means that measuring @xmath98 observables is enough for any pure state to be uda , which proves the theorem .",
    "there are indeed technical details to be clarified that we leave to appendix a.    if we compare our results with those given in  @xcite , which shows that measuring @xmath1 observables are enough for any pure state to be udp , there exists an obvious gap .",
    "we claim that this gap indeed can not be closed in general . to see this ,",
    "let us look at the simplest case of @xmath48 , where the results just compared state that @xmath99 observables are enough for any pure state to be udp but @xmath100 observables are enough for any pure state to be uda .",
    "if one can measure a particular set @xmath17 with @xmath99 observables and have all pure states be uda , then also every state also must be udp for measuring @xmath17 . according to  @xcite ,",
    "this only happens if @xmath89 contains a single invertible traceless operator @xmath101 , meaning @xmath101 is rank @xmath102 . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume the largest eigenvalue @xmath101 to be positive with an eigenstate @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath8 is not uda by measuring @xmath17 since as observed in  @xcite there exists a mixed state which also has the same average values as those of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , one can not only measure @xmath99 observables for all pure states to be uda .    for general @xmath0 , our construction needs @xmath2 observables . we do not know whether this is the optimal construction , but it is very unlikely one can get this down to @xmath1 . in other words , in general uda and udp for pure states should be indeed two different concepts and there should always be gaps between the number of observables needed to be measured for each case to uniquely determine any pure quantum state",
    "this is one exception though , which is for the qubit case ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) where it is shown in  @xcite that for all pure states to be udp , one needs to measure @xmath103 variables , which then uniquely determine any quantum state among all states .",
    "finally , we remark that our results in theorem 1 naturally extend to the case of low rank states .",
    "that is , for a rank @xmath104 quantum state @xmath4 , we can similarly consider two different cases : ( 1 ) @xmath4 is uniquely determined by measuring @xmath17 among all rank @xmath105 states ( which was considered in  @xcite ) ( 2 ) @xmath4 is uniquely determined by measuring @xmath17 among all quantum states of any rank .",
    "[ th : udaq ] for a @xmath0-dimensional system ( @xmath91 ) measuring @xmath106 observables is enough for a rank @xmath105 state to be uniquely determined among all states .",
    "compared to the results in  @xcite , where @xmath107 observables are needed to uniquely determine any rank @xmath105 states among all rank @xmath105 states , when @xmath0 is large the difference in the leading term has a @xmath0 gap .",
    "the proof idea is similar to that of theorem  [ th : uda ] , so we leave the details to appendix a.",
    "in this section we discuss the case where the hilbert space @xmath3 is a multipartite quantum system , where the observables correspond to the reduced density matrices ( rdms ) .",
    "that is , the observables are chosen to be acting nontrivially only on some subsystems .",
    "for instance , for a three - qubit system , the observables corresponding to the @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 can be chosen as @xmath108 where @xmath109 are pauli @xmath110 operators acting on the @xmath111th qubit .",
    "for simplicity in this section we consider only @xmath102-particle systems , labeled by @xmath30 , and each with hilbert space dimension @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "nevertheless , our method naturally extends to systems of more than @xmath102-particles .",
    "recall that for a three particle system , it is known that almost all three - qubit pure states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms  @xcite .",
    "this result can be further improved to @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite . more generally , if @xmath32 , then almost all pure states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath115 , then almost every pure state is udp by its @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "we notice that different from the discussion in sec .",
    "ii , one no longer considers uniqueness for all pure states , but ` almost all ' of them .",
    "this means there exists a measure zero set of pure states which are not uniquely determined . for instance , for the three qubit case , any state which is local unitarily equivalent to the ghz type state @xmath116 can not be udp , as any state of the form @xmath117 has the same @xmath27-rdms as those of @xmath118 .",
    "this means that , for a three qubit pure state @xmath8 , it is either uda , or not udp .",
    "in other words , if any three qubit pure state @xmath8 is udp , then it is uda by its @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this sense , we say in this case udp implies uda for all pure states .",
    "however , for the general case of a three particle system , there is a gap between known results of uda and udp .",
    "our following result improves the bound for the uda case .",
    "[ th : rdm1 ] if @xmath119 , then almost every tripartite quantum state @xmath120 is uda by its @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,    to see why this is the case , an arbitrary pure state @xmath121 of this system can be written as @xmath122 if there is another state @xmath4 which agrees with @xmath121 in its subsystems @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then we can find a pure state @xmath123 which agrees with @xmath4 on the subsystem @xmath124 and also agrees with @xmath125 in subsystems @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since the rank of the @xmath27-rdm of the subsystem @xmath28 is at most @xmath126 , the pure state @xmath127 can be written as a superposition of @xmath128 as follows .",
    "@xmath129 where @xmath130 for any @xmath131 . here",
    "@xmath132 will be vectors ( perhaps unnormalized ) in @xmath133 .",
    "the states @xmath132 can be chosen to be orthonormal vectors in the subsystem @xmath133 , and then for almost all states @xmath121 , the set of @xmath134 will be linearly independent .",
    "let us write @xmath135 .",
    "for any @xmath131 , we will have @xmath136    now let s consider the subsystem @xmath29 . since @xmath125 and @xmath127 have the same rdms for particles @xmath29 , this gives @xmath137    substituting eqs .   and   into eq .  , and comparing each matrix element , results in the following equalities ( for all @xmath138 ) : @xmath139    now let us define @xmath140 . then eq",
    ".   is a linear equation system with variables @xmath141 .",
    "it is not hard to verify that @xmath142 is a solution to the equation system , which corresponds to the state @xmath125 .",
    "now we need to show that when @xmath143 , eq .",
    "has only one solution which is given by eq .  .",
    "it turns out that this is indeed the case which then proves theorem  [ th : rdm1 ] .",
    "in fact , the linear equations above are generically linearly independent . to see this ,",
    "let s fix @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "then the coefficient matrix can be written as the following : @xmath148 the @xmath149 entry in the above matrix is @xmath150 .",
    "if there are more than @xmath5 solutions , then the determinant of the above matrix should be zero .",
    "note that the determinant can be written as a polynomial of @xmath151 s and @xmath152 s .",
    "since @xmath153 appears only once in the polynomial , the determinant of the top @xmath154 by @xmath154 submatrix must be non - zero generically .",
    "therefore , @xmath155 linear equations are sufficient to determine @xmath156 variables .    however , we do not know whether the sufficient condition given by theorem  [ th : rdm1 ] for almost all three - particle pure state to be uda by its @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 is also necessary .",
    "this still leaves a gap between the result of theorem  [ th : rdm1 ] for uda , and the result for udp in  @xcite .",
    "they both only coincide when @xmath157 , i.e. , the three qubit case .",
    "it remains open for other cases , whether udp can imply uda .",
    "following a similar discussion as in sec .",
    "ii , our result in this section also extends to uniqueness of low rank quantum states .",
    "in particular , we have the following theorem .",
    "[ th : rdm2 ] almost every tripartite density operator @xmath4 acting on the hilbert space @xmath158 with rank no more than @xmath159 can be uniquely determined among all states by its @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this result is to our knowledge , the first one for uniqueness of mixed states with respect to rdms .",
    "the proof is a direct extension of that for theorem  [ th : rdm1 ] , but with more lengthy details that we will include in appendix b.    let us look at some consequences of theorem  [ th : rdm2 ] .",
    "consider a four qubit system with qubits @xmath160 , and look at the qubits @xmath161 as a single systems @xmath162 .",
    "then theorem  [ th : rdm2 ] says also that almost all four qubit states of rank @xmath27 are uda by their rdms of particles @xmath28 and @xmath163 , or one can say that almost all four qubit states of rank @xmath27 are uda by their @xmath102-rdms .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the multipartite result in  @xcite which states that almost all four - qubit pure states are uda by their @xmath102-rdms , and our result is indeed stronger .",
    "this demonstrates that our analysis naturally extends to systems of more than @xmath102-particles .",
    "we also remark that the rank of a state @xmath4 which could be uda by its @xmath23-rdms needs to be relatively low , otherwise one can always find another state @xmath164 with lower rank which has the same @xmath23-rdms as those of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "in sec . ii and sec .",
    "iii , we discussed the difference and coincidence between the two kinds of uniqueness for pure states , uda and udp , which in general are not the same thing .",
    "however , in certain interesting circumstances such as the three qubit case with respect to @xmath27-rdms , and in general the @xmath20-qubit case respect to @xmath37-rdms , they do coincide .",
    "starting from this section we would like to build some general understanding of the circumstances when udp implies uda for all pure states .",
    "we start from the simplest case of @xmath165 , where only two observables are measured , i.e. , @xmath166 .",
    "intuitively , in this extreme case almost no pure state can be uniquely determined , either uda or even udp .",
    "however there are also exceptions .",
    "for instance , if one of the observables , say @xmath167 , has a nondegenerate ground state @xmath8 , then @xmath8 is uda ( hence , of course , udp ) even by measuring @xmath167 only .",
    "one would hope this is the only exception , that is , for a pure state @xmath8 , either it is uda , or it is not udp , when only two observables are measured .",
    "we make this intuition rigorous by the following theorem .",
    "[ th : num ] when only two observables are measured , i.e. , @xmath166 , udp implies uda for any pure state @xmath8 , regardless of the dimension @xmath0 .    to prove this theorem , recall that measuring @xmath17 ( i.e. , measuring every observable in @xmath17 ) for all quantum states @xmath4 returns the set @xmath168 given by eq",
    "we know that @xmath168 is a convex set , meaning for any @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 for any @xmath171 .    for pure states , the corresponding set of average values",
    "is given by @xmath172 as defined in eq .  .",
    "unlike @xmath168 , @xmath172 in general is not convex .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to see that @xmath173 when @xmath172 is convex .    for @xmath165 , the hausdorff ",
    "toeplitz theorem @xcite gives convexity of the numerical range of any operator , which in turn shows that @xmath174 is convex .",
    "we explain it briefly here . for any operator",
    "@xmath175 acting on a hilbert space @xmath3 , the numerical range of @xmath175 is the set of all complex numbers @xmath176 , where @xmath8 ranges over all pure states in @xmath3 .    note that one can always write @xmath175 as @xmath177\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}[(b+b^{\\dag})+i(-ib+ib^{\\dag})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we define @xmath178 and @xmath179 then clearly both @xmath167 and @xmath180 are hermitian .",
    "then @xmath174 is nothing but the numerical range of @xmath181 and hence is convex .",
    "furthermore , by studying the properties of the numerical range , it was shown in  @xcite ( using different terminology ) that if a pure state @xmath8 is udp , the point @xmath182 must be an extreme point of @xmath174 . here",
    "@xmath183 is an extreme point of the convex set @xmath174 if there do not exist @xmath184 , such that @xmath185 for some @xmath171 .    because @xmath186 , @xmath183 is also an extreme point of @xmath187 .",
    "one can further show that for any extreme point @xmath183 of @xmath187 , and any quantum state @xmath4 with @xmath188 , any pure quantum state @xmath121 in the range of @xmath4 will also have @xmath189 .",
    "this then implies that if a pure state @xmath8 is udp by measuring @xmath17 , it must also be uda , which proves the theorem .    again , all the technical details of the proof will be presented in appendix c.    in an attempt to extend theorem  [ th : num ] to the @xmath190 case , a natural question that one could ask is whether or not udp implies uda whenever @xmath172 is convex .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case , as demonstrated by the following example .    for the qutrit case ( @xmath48 ) ,",

    "therefore , although the hausdorff  toeplitz theorem @xcite is famous for showing the convexity of numerical range of any operator , there is indeed a deeper reason than just the convexity of the numerical range which governs the validity of theorem  [ th : num ] .",
    "we leave the more detailed discussion to appendix  c.",
    "in this section , we discuss some circumstances where udp implies uda in a more general context where more than two observables are measured , i.e. , @xmath195 .",
    "our focus is on the symmetry of the set of all quantum states . for a @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space @xmath3",
    "we denote this set of states by @xmath196 , that is @xmath197 note that @xmath196 is convex , as we know that for any @xmath198 , @xmath199 for all @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore , the extreme points of @xmath196 are all the pure states .",
    "@xmath196 is also called the state space for all the operators acting on @xmath3 .",
    "we now explain the intuition .",
    "if @xmath196 has a certain symmetry , then two pure states @xmath200 and @xmath201 that are ` connected ' by the symmetry will give the same measurement results , and states @xmath8 fixed by the symmetry will also be fixed by the projection onto the space of observables .",
    "in this situation , udp implies uda for all pure states .    to make this intuition concrete ,",
    "let us first consider an example for @xmath46 , i.e. , the qubit case .",
    "we know that @xmath196 can be parameterized as in eq .  , where for @xmath202 , @xmath203 are chosen as pauli matrices given in eq .  .",
    "here @xmath196 is the bloch ball as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "the bloch ball is clearly a convex set and the extreme points are those pure states on the boundary , which give the bloch sphere .",
    "we know that geometrically , measuring the observables in @xmath17 corresponds to the projection onto the plane spanned by @xmath17 .",
    "for example , if we measure the pauli @xmath204 and @xmath205 operators , then geometrically this corresponds to the projection of the bloch ball onto the @xmath206 plane . since the bloch ball has reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath206 plane , two pure states ( e.g. points @xmath175 and @xmath207 ) connected by that symmetry will project onto the same measurement result @xmath208 , as will all mixtures of @xmath175 and @xmath207 .",
    "hence neither udp nor uda hold for such pure states for measuring @xmath204 and @xmath205 . on the other hand ,",
    "pure states fixed by the reflection symmetry are also fixed by the projection onto the @xmath206 plane .",
    "these are precisely the points on the bloch sphere that are in the @xmath206 plane ( e.g. the points @xmath209 and @xmath210 in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) , and for such pure states both udp and uda hold . therefore , for the observables @xmath211 we conclude that udp = uda .",
    "now let us look at another case where we only measure the pauli @xmath204 operator .",
    "consider the group of symmetries of the bloch ball consisting of rotation around the @xmath212 axis .",
    "( rotation by angle @xmath213 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] . in that figure",
    ", point @xmath175 will become point @xmath214 after this particular rotation , and indeed both points @xmath175 and @xmath214 yield the same measurement result , which is represented by point @xmath208 on the @xmath212 axis . )",
    "note that two points on the bloch sphere will project to the same measurement result on the @xmath212 axis if and only if they are in the same orbit under the rotation group .",
    "thus a measurement result will come from a single pure state exactly when that pure state is a fixed point , and hence either both or neither of udp and uda hold for each pure state .",
    "for example , the point @xmath209 is fixed by the rotation , and is uniquely determined by the measurement of @xmath204 among all states .",
    "@xmath209 corresponds to the @xmath215 eigenstate of the pauli @xmath204 operator .",
    "therefore , the rotational symmetry of the bloch ball along the @xmath212 axis gives udp = uda for any pure state when measuring the pauli @xmath204 operator , which corresponds to the @xmath212 axis .",
    "mathematically , a symmetry of @xmath196 is an affine automorphism of @xmath196 .",
    "if @xmath216 is unitary , the map taking @xmath4 to @xmath217 is such an affine automorphism ( which for @xmath218 will just be rotation around some axis of the bloch ball ) .",
    "for instance , the rotation symmetry along the @xmath212 axis by an angle @xmath213 is given by conjugation by the unitary operator @xmath219 .",
    "if @xmath101 is the conjugate linear map given by complex conjugation in the computational basis ( @xmath220 ) , then the map taking @xmath4 to @xmath221 is the transpose map . for @xmath218 ,",
    "this map is reflection of the bloch ball in the xy - plane .",
    "recall that for a set of observables @xmath17 , we denote the real linear span by @xmath87 .",
    "when discussing the uniqueness problems , it makes no difference if we append the identity operator to @xmath17 .",
    "let us then assume @xmath222 .",
    "we are now ready to put our intuition into a theorem .",
    "[ th : symmetry ] assume there exists a compact group @xmath210 of affine automorphisms of @xmath196 whose fixed point set is @xmath223 .",
    "then each pure state acting on @xmath3 which is udp for measuring @xmath17 is also uda .    in the first example above",
    ", the group for the reflection consists of the two element group generated by the reflection . in the rotation example",
    ", we can take the group to consist of all rotations around the given axis .",
    "we will leave the detailed mathematical proof of theorem [ th : symmetry ] to appendix d , where operator algebras are one ingredient of the proof .    to motivate some further consequences of theorem  [ th : symmetry ] , consider a simple example .",
    "if @xmath17 consists of a basis of diagonal matrices ( i.e. , a set of mutually commuting observables ) , then for any pure state , udp implies uda by theorem  [ th : symmetry ] . here",
    "the group of symmetries can be taken to be conjugation by all diagonal unitaries .",
    "this group has fixed point set @xmath224 . in a more general case ,",
    "if the complex span of @xmath225 is a * -subalgebra of the operators acting on @xmath3 , then udp = uda for all pure states for measuring @xmath17 . this is a natural corollary of theorem  [ th : symmetry ] that we will also discuss in detail in appendix d.",
    "in this work , we have discussed the uniqueness of quantum states compatible with given results for measuring a set of observables . for a given pure state ,",
    "we consider two different types of uniqueness , udp and uda .",
    "we have taken the first step to study their relationship systematically . in doing so",
    "we have established a number of results , but also leave with many open questions .",
    "first of all , although in general udp and uda are evidently different concepts , their difference is surprisingly ` not that large ' . specifically in the sense of general counting of the number of variables one needs to measure to uniquely",
    "determine all pure states in a @xmath0 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "compared to full quantum tomography which requires @xmath6 variables measured to uniquely determine any quantum state , the @xmath2 observables we have constructed to uniquely determine any pure state among all states is a significant improvement .",
    "it is indeed larger than the @xmath1 observables given in @xcite to uniquely determine any pure state among all pure states , but the difference is only linear in @xmath0 .",
    "we do not know whether there could be another construction for which we could further close the linear difference between uda and udp , to leave only a constant gap for large @xmath0 .    when the hilbert space is a multipartite quantum system , and the observables correspond to the rdms , we focused on the situation when ` almost all pure states ' are uniquely determined .",
    "we considered a @xmath102-particle system with hilbert space @xmath226 , and showed that if @xmath38 , then almost all pure states are uda by their @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "this improves the results of @xcite , where @xmath32 is required ; however it still leaves a gap compared to the diosi udp result which states that for @xmath33 , almost all pure states are udp by their @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "because our proof only gives a sufficient condition for uda , we do not know whether it can be further improved .",
    "we also do not have an example showing there is indeed gap between uda and udp for almost all three - particle pure states to be uniquely determined by @xmath27-rdms of particle pairs @xmath227 and @xmath228 .    finally , we considered situations for which we can show that udp implies uda .",
    "these include : ( i ) the general @xmath27-qubit system ; ( ii ) the @xmath102-qubit system when we consider uniqueness for almost all pure states and the measurements corresponds to @xmath27-rdms ; ( iii ) when only two observables are measured ; and ( iv ) the observables measured correspond to some symmetry of the state space .",
    "however we do not know how far we are from enumerating all the possible situations that udp implies uda , when considering uniqueness for all pure states or almost all pure states .",
    "in principle one can even consider the relationship between udp and uda for special subsets of pure states .",
    "we believe our systematic study of the uniqueness of quantum states compatible with given measurement results shed light on several aspects of quantum information theory and its connection to different topics in mathematics .",
    "these include quantum tomography and the space of hermitian operators , unique ground states of local hamiltonians and general solutions to certain linear equations , measurements and numerical ranges of operators , and the geometric meaning of measurements and the symmetry of state space .",
    "we thus conclude with several open questions that we believe warrant further investigation .",
    "theorem  [ th : uda ] can be implied by the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma:2 + - ] there exists a set of @xmath94 linearly independent hermitian matrices @xmath229 , such that the hermitian matrix @xmath96 has at least two positive eigenvalues for any nonzero real vector @xmath97 .",

    "our proof is motivated by and similar to the diagonal filling technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but along the other direction of the diagonals .",
    "we will need the lemma 9 from ref .",
