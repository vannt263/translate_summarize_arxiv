    "stellar orbits in the center of a galaxy are not static , and sometimes stars walk into trouble . if an unlucky star passes within @xmath2 of the galaxy s central black hole ( bh ) , the bh s tidal gravity exceeds the star s self - gravity , and the star is disrupted .",
    "for bhs with @xmath3 , the disruption of a solar - type star occurs outside the horizon and is likely accompanied by a week- to year - long electromagnetic flare ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational interactions between stars ensure that all supermassive bhs tidally disrupt nearby stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the scattering process might be accelerated by resonant relaxation very close to the bh @xcite , or interactions with `` massive perturbers '' like a massive accretion disk @xcite or giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "in addition , the galactic potential may be triaxial so stars need not be scattered at all : they may simply follow their chaotic orbits down to @xmath4 @xcite . given these uncertainties , predictions for the timescale between tidal disruptions in a given galaxy range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 years .",
    "the rate remains uncertain , but tidal disruption must occur .",
    "indeed , a handful of candidate events have been detected to date .",
    "the accreting stellar debris is expected to emit blackbody radiation from very close to the bh , so x - ray and uv observations probe the bulk of the emission .",
    "several candidate tidal disruption events were discovered in the rosat all - sky survey ( see * ? ? ? * ) and the xmm - newton slew survey @xcite ; the galex deep imaging survey has so far yielded three candidates @xcite . for rosat ,",
    "these detections are consistent with a rate @xmath7 per galaxy @xcite , but the data are sparse .",
    "however , we are entering a new era of transient surveys : in the optical , surveys like pan - starrs ( ps1 , then all four telescopes ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the palomar transient factory @xcite , and later the large synoptic survey telescope will have fast cadence , wide fields of view , and unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "wide - field transient surveys with rapid cadence are also planned at other wavelengths , including the radio ( e.g. , lofar and the ata ) , near - infrared ( e.g. , sasir ) , and hard x - rays ( e.g. , exist ) .",
    "how many tidal flares these surveys find depends on their luminosity and spectra as a function of time .    in this paper",
    ", we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal disruption events as a function of time .",
    "since the early work on tidal disruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been well - appreciated that the bulk of the emission occurs in the uv and soft x - rays , with a possible extension to harder x - rays .",
    "taking into account only this emission , optical wavelengths are not the most promising for detecting tidal flares , because the blackbody temperature of the inner accretion disk is @xmath8 .",
    "we show , however , that there are two additional sources of optical emission that likely dominate the optical flux in many , though not all , cases : ( 1 ) emission produced by a super - eddington outflow at early times and ( 2 ) emission produced by the irradiation and photoionization of unbound stellar debris ( see also the earlier work of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case ,",
    "much of the optical emission is in the form of very broad emission lines , while in the former it is primarily continuum ( although some lines may also be present ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we typically discuss these two sources of emission separately , largely because the physics of the photoionized stellar debris is more secure than that of the super - eddington outflows .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ outflows ] , [ diskmodel ] and [ unbound ] , we describe our models for the polar super - eddington outflow , accretion disk and the equatorial unbound material , respectively ; then in  [ emissionprops ] we calculate the luminosity and spectral signatures of tidal disruption events .",
    "we predict detection rates in  [ rates ] , and summarize and discuss our results in  [ discussion ] .",
    " [ data ] and [ discussion ] include a discussion of our models in the context of rosat and galex observations of tidal flare candidates .",
    "we consider a star approaching the bh on a parabolic orbit with pericenter distance @xmath9 .",
    "once the star reaches the vicinity of the tidal radius ( @xmath10 ) , the tidal gravity stretches it radially and compresses it vertically and azimuthally .",
    "the acceleration is @xmath11 and acts for a dynamical time @xmath12 near pericenter , resulting in velocity perturbations @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the star s radius and @xmath15 is the star s escape velocity .",
    "the change in velocity @xmath16 is smaller than the star s orbital velocity at pericenter , @xmath17 , by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "because @xmath16 is at least as large as the sound speed inside the star , the stellar gas may shock vertically and azimuthally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". once the shredded star passes through pericenter , the compression subsides and the star re - expands , cooling adiabatically ; thermal pressure becomes negligible and the particles travel away from the bh ballistically .",
    "we assume that the particle trajectories become ballistic when the star passes through pericenter . at that time , the particles have perturbed azimuthal , vertical , and radial velocities @xmath19 .",
    "the particles have a range in specific energy @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to their relative locations in the bh s potential well and differences in their azimuthal speeds .",
    "initially , approximately half of the stellar mass is bound and half is unbound @xcite . after a time @xmath21 the most bound material returns to pericenter .",
    "( here we have defined @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . )",
    "less bound gas follows , at a rate @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "there will be some deviations from this canonical @xmath26 scaling at early times , depending on the precise structure of the star @xcite , but we use equation ( [ mdotfallback ] ) for simplicity . as matter returns to pericenter , it shocks on itself , converting most of its bulk orbital energy to thermal energy ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the viscous time is typically shorter than the fallback time , so at least some of the matter begins to accrete .    for @xmath27",
    ", the mass fallback rate predicted by equations ( [ tfallback ] ) & ( [ mdotfallback ] ) can be much greater than the eddington rate @xmath28 for a period of weeks to years ; here @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the eddington luminosity , and 0.1 is the assumed efficiency of converting accretion power to luminosity .",
    "the fallback rate only falls below the eddington rate at a time @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "while the fallback rate is super - eddington , the stellar gas returning to pericenter is so dense that it can not radiate and cool . in particular ,",
    "the time for photons to diffuse out of the gas is longer than both the inflow time in the disk and the dynamical time characteristic of an outflow .",
    "the gas is likely to form an advective accretion disk accompanied by powerful outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the relative importance of accretion and outflows in this phase is somewhat uncertain ( see  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "later , when @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , the outflows subside , and the accretion disk can radiatively cool and becomes thin .    in  [ outflows ] , we describe our model for the super - eddington outflows , and in  [ diskmodel ] , we describe our model for the accretion disk .",
    "we discuss uncertainties in these models in  [ discussion ] .",
    "when the fallback rate to pericenter is super - eddington , radiation produced by the shock and by viscous stresses in the rotating disk is trapped by electron scattering . by energy conservation , this material is initially all bound to the bh , but it is only weakly bound because the radiation can not escape and because the material originated on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "some fraction of the returning gas is thus likely unbound ( see , e.g. , the simulations of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with energy being conserved as other gas accretes inward @xcite .",
    "if the outflow s covering fraction is high , most of the radiated power will be emitted from the outflow s photosphere , which can be far outside @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we now estimate the properties of this outflowing gas ( see @xcite for related estimates in the context of short - duration gamma - ray bursts ) .    in our simplified scenario ,",
    "stellar debris falls back at close to the escape velocity and shocks at the launch radius @xmath36 , converting bulk kinetic energy to radiation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the temperature at @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the density of gas at @xmath39 , and @xmath41 . outflowing gas",

    "we define the trapping radius @xmath47 via @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the opacity due to electron scattering ) : inside @xmath47 , the gas is too optically thick for photons to escape and so the outflowing gas expands adiabatically . because the outflow remains supported by radiation pressure , @xmath50 .",

    "the total luminosity during this phase grows as @xmath62 while the luminosity on the rayleigh - jeans tail increases even more rapidly , @xmath63 .",
    "after a time @xmath64 the density falls sufficiently that the photosphere lies well inside @xmath58 ; the photosphere s radius is then @xmath65 and its temperature is @xmath66 the adiabatically expanding outflow preserves the photon distribution function generated in the shock and accretion disk close to the bh .",
    "estimates indicate that this gas is likely to be close to thermal equilibrium and thus we assume that the escaping photons have a blackbody spectrum @xmath67 when the photosphere lies inside the edge of the outflow ( i.e. , @xmath68 so @xmath69 ) , equations ( [ rph ] ) and ( [ tphnoedge ] ) imply that the total luminosity of the outflow is @xmath70 the total luminosity of the outflow is thus of order the eddington luminosity : see figure [ lpeakfig ] , discussed in  [ outflow_emission ] .",
    "note that the total luminosity decreases for lower outflow rates , @xmath71 , because the photosphere s surface area is smaller .",

    "the time for photons to diffuse out of the disk is longer than the viscous time , and so the disk is thick and advective . in contrast , at later times when @xmath79 , the disk is thin and can cool by radiative diffusion .",

    "there is , however , a significant uncertainty in precisely how much of the falling back material is blown away , and in the kinematics of the outflow .",
    "we assume that the gas expands roughly spherically from the bh , but the flow is probably somewhat collimated along the pole , due to the original angular momentum of the stellar debris . some photons",

    "it is worth noting that our predictions for the radiation from super - eddington outflows are particularly uncertain for low @xmath56 and small @xmath181 , when the edge of the outflow limits the radius of the photosphere and determines both the peak luminosity ( fig .",

    "these precise values will depend on the pericenter of the star , with smaller @xmath181 likely leading to smaller @xmath314 , i.e. , a smaller fraction of the gas being blown away .",
    "future observational constraints on the luminosity , spectrum , and timescale of the super - eddington outflow phase should be able to strongly constrain the value of @xmath314 in individual events .",
    "these results will have important implications for how massive bhs grow .",
    "in particular , if @xmath314 is typically modest , this would imply that black holes can accrete at rates far above the eddington rate , perhaps helping to explain how supermassive bhs ( @xmath337 ) can be observable as luminous quasars as early as @xmath338 .",
    "figure [ outflowratesfig ] also demonstrates that deep optical surveys such as the pan - starrs mds and lsst will be sensitive to tidal flares at high redshift .",
    "these surveys may thus provide a powerful probe of the bh mass function and stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei as a function of redshift .",
    "for example , at @xmath339 , bhs having @xmath340 are still growing significantly in mass @xcite and thus their disruption rates may evolve significantly with redshift .",
    "in addition , galaxy mergers , which are more common at @xmath341 , could substantially increase the tidal disruption rate : @xcite find rates of up to @xmath342 for @xmath343 after the merger due to three - body interactions between stars and a binary bh .",
    "we now consider several aspects of our model for the accretion disk , broad emission lines , and the material unbound during the disruption (   [ diskmodel ] and [ unbound ] ) .",
    "our accretion disk model is designed to describe the emission from the time when the disk first forms through the following few years . during much of this period , the fallback rate is super - eddington , and we expect the disk to be optically and geometrically thick , with radiation pressure dominating gas pressure . once the fallback rate becomes sub - eddington , the disk becomes geometrically thin and may be subject to viscous instabilities ( although it is thermally stable ; @xcite ) . these instabilities may lead to additional time dependence not captured in our models , particularly at late times when the viscous time in the thin disk becomes comparable to the orbital period of the material falling back to pericenter . as described above ,",
    "once @xmath344 , the density is sufficiently low that the flow becomes radiatively inefficient and our model is no longer appropriate .",
    "the disk will then heat up and its spectrum will become significantly harder",
    ". this phase may be detectable by hard x - ray transient surveys like exist .",
    "it is also unclear how much tidal forces will spin up the rotation of the star as it approaches pericenter .",
    "we have assumed that the star is maximally spun up , so that stellar debris is accelerated to relative velocities @xmath345 in the azimuthal direction .",
    "if in fact the spin - up is less effective , the onset of the flare , which occurs at the fallback time ( eq . [ [ tfallback ] ] ) , will be later by a factor of few and the solid angle subtended by the unbound equatorial debris will be somewhat smaller .",
    "this will not change our qualitative conclusions , only some of our quantitative results .",
    "it is important to stress that the line emission we predict may well be an underestimate in all cases : the accretion disk will also photoionize the _ back edge _ of the material that was blown away during the super - eddington phase , which is far from the bh once the outflows subside .",
    "simple estimates indicate that the density and velocity of this outflowing gas are similar to that of the gas unbound at the time of disruption ; as a result , irradiation of this gas will produce additional broad hydrogen lines .",
    "the equivalent width of these lines depends on the solid angle subtended by the super - eddington winds , which , although uncertain , is likely to be significant .",
    "these lines are unlikely to depend as sensitively on @xmath56 and @xmath181 as the emission lines from the equatorial debris ( see fig .",
    "[ optir_fiduc ] for the latter ) . as a result",
    ", observations of the line emission will help constrain the geometry of the outflowing gas created during the tidal disruption event .",
    "in addition to emission lines from the back edge of the outflowing gas at late times , the photosphere of the super - eddington outflow may at early times show strong _ absorption lines _ , particularly in the ultraviolet ( much like the photosphere of a star ) ; these lines would likely be highly blueshifted relative to the lines of the host galaxy .",
    "finally , we reiterate that we expect very little narrow forbidden line emission from tidal disruption events : the outflowing stellar debris is too dense to produce forbidden lines , and there is insufficient time to photoionize ambient lower density gas far from the bh .",
    "it is possible that there is ambient gas in the galactic nucleus sufficiently close to the bh to produce forbidden lines on a @xmath346 timescale , but the prevalence of such gas is currently poorly understood .",
    "candidate detections of tidal disruption flares have thus far been selected by their uv and soft x - ray emission ( predominantly via galex , rosat and xmm - newton ) .",
    "the emission at these wavelengths is primarily produced by the accretion disk , which is brighter for larger @xmath56 . as a result ,",
    "these surveys are most sensitive to bhs having @xmath347 .",
    "uv and x - ray selected events are likely to be discovered somewhat after the initial period of super - eddington fallback , because the outflow during that phase probably precludes direct observation of the underlying accretion disk from many viewing angles .",
    "this outflowing material could also be a significant source of obscuration even at late times when the fallback rate is sub - eddington .",
    "the accretion disk emission we predict for uv - selected events is broadly consistent with the galex candidates : uv luminosities of @xmath348 , optical luminosities of @xmath349 , blackbody temperatures of @xmath350 , and bolometric luminosities of @xmath351 .",
    "the events selected from soft x - rays have less data , but typically have soft x - ray luminosities of @xmath352 .",
    "this emission may be from the accretion disk , at energies just above the blackbody peak , or may be from an x - ray power - law tail with @xmath353 of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "in addition , as discussed in  [ data ] , our model is consistent with rosat and galex rate estimates , provided that the tidal disruption rate per galaxy for bhs with @xmath354 is @xmath355 .",
    "this constraint already suggests that galactic nuclei in the nearby universe are relatively spherical , rather than triaxial , because the expected disruption rate is significantly higher in the latter case @xcite .    as described in  [ emissionprops ] , the spectral signature of the equatorial stellar debris is a transient spectrum of broad emission lines shifted in wavelength relative to the host galaxy .",
    "we do not expect forbidden lines ( e.g. [ nii ] , [ sii ] , [ oi ] , [ oiii ] ) to be present , because the density in the unbound material is too high .",
    "line of [ oiii ] does appear at late times for the lowest @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where the densities fall below this ion s critical density after about a year .",
    "] for several reasons , it is not surprising that this spectral signature has yet to be seen .",
    "first , the tidal flare candidates are likely from relatively high - mass bhs ; in those events , the unbound stellar debris subtends a small solid angle ( eq . [ [ domega ] ] ) and",
    "so the emission lines should be @xmath356 of the bulge luminosity .",
    "future optically - selected tidal flares are more likely to show detectable lines .",
    "it is also important to note that most standard searches for agn in optical / infrared surveys use forbidden lines to identify nuclear activity , and have not specifically looked for faint , broad lines offset from the host galaxy s lines .",
    "tidal disruption events may yet be hiding in archival spectroscopic data .",
    "we predict that outflows during the super - eddington fallback phase have peak optical luminosities of @xmath357 and characteristic decay timescales of @xmath0 days ( figs .",
    "[ lpeakfig ] & [ outflow_tevent ] ) .",
    "these events are sufficiently bright that a natural concern is whether our predictions can already be ruled out by optical supernova searches such as the supernova legacy survey and stripe 82 in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "although a careful search of archival data is clearly warranted , we do not believe that current observations are necessarily that constraining , for two reasons .",
    "first , the outflow phase can be relatively brief and many survey cadences may be insufficient to find these events .",
    "most importantly , however , tidal flares could be readily mistaken for agn and thus discarded .",
    "indeed , most supernova searches discard galactic nuclei in order to avoid confusion with agn and optimize their probability of detecting supernovae .    optically detecting a tidal flare",
    "may require disentangling the flare emission from that of the bh s host galaxy .",
    "for example , at a distance of 300 mpc , a ground - based optical survey with a resolution @xmath358 \" should just be able to resolve a kiloparsec - sized bulge .",
    "bulges are found to be @xmath359 times more massive than their central bhs @xcite .",
    "super - eddington outflows typically shine at @xmath360 ( see fig . [ lpeakfig ] ) , so this phase should be at least as bright as the host galaxy and readily detectable given sufficient attention to sources in galactic nuclei and careful screening to rule out an unsteady agn .",
    "by contrast , the typical optical luminosity of the accretion disk itself is @xmath361 ( see fig .",
    "[ outflow_lc ] ) .",
    "the accretion disk would thus brighten the host bulge by only a few percent .",
    "photometric detections of late - time flares will require very careful bulge subtraction . as a result ,",
    "shallow , wide - area surveys such as ptf are more likely to find the late - time disk emission than narrow deep surveys such as the pan - starrs mds . as an additional complication to finding tidal flares , optical extinction in galactic nuclei can be significant ( although less than at uv or soft x - rays ) ; as a result , some fraction of optical tidal flares may not be detectable due to obscuration .",
    "infrared surveys such as sasir , which are also very sensitive to tidal disruption events ( table [ surveytable ] ) , will be particularly immune to the effects of obscuration .",
    "type ii supernovae in the nuclear regions of galaxies may be confused with tidal disruption events , as both have quite blue colors . for sources at @xmath362 mpc",
    ", we estimate that such supernovae will occur within @xmath363 of the galactic nucleus at a rate of @xmath364 , perhaps an order of magnitude more often than tidal disruption events ; at higher redshift the contamination from supernovae will be more significant , but follow - up imaging at high spatial resolution and/or spectroscopic follow - up should help classify these events and distinguish tidal flares from nuclear supernovae .",
    "theoretical calculations of the tidal disruption rate per galaxy , @xmath218 , vary substantially and can have complicated dependences on bh mass and pericenter distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rate model we implement is consistent with theoretical estimates and is sufficiently simple that the reader can easily scale our results to different model parameters ( eq . [ [ ratescaling ] ] ) .",
    "we have assumed that the rate at which stars enter the disruption zone ( @xmath365 ) is independent of bh mass , and constant with @xmath366 .",
    "a star may venture deep into the disruption zone ( @xmath367 ) on its last orbit if its change in angular momentum over one dynamical time is large enough  at least of order the maximum angular momentum for disruption .",
    "this condition is satisfied in the full loss cone regime , and marginally satisfied in the outskirts of the diffusive regime . for realistic stellar density profiles ,",
    "the disruption rate is dominated by the boundary between these two regimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so many stars probably do take large enough angular momentum steps to arrive at @xmath368 . in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the disruption rate per @xmath369 varies weakly with @xmath369 , consistent with our assumption in  [ rates ] .",
    "given the sensitivity of the optical - infrared emission from tidal flares to @xmath57 , upcoming surveys should significantly improve our knowledge of the stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei .",
    "our results demonstrate that optical transient surveys will be quite sensitive to the lowest mass bhs in galactic nuclei , both because of the outflows produced when the fallback rate is super - eddington and because of the large angle subtended by the equatorial stellar debris .",
    "such bhs are otherwise difficult to detect because their host galaxies are faint , it is difficult to resolve their small spheres of influence , and even when they are active , their eddington luminosities are low .",
    "the space density of @xmath242 bhs and the stellar density profiles in the galaxies they inhabit are only moderately well - constrained at present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as is the role of tidal disruption in growing these bhs .",
    "optical searches for tidal flares should thus prove to be a powerful probe of low - mass bhs and their host galaxies .",
