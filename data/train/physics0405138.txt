    "solar wind provides a great opportunity to get  in situ \" observations of a magnetized plasma on a wide range of scales .",
    "in fact , many spacecrafts have been launched in the interplanetary space during past years , in order to study the properties of plasma .",
    "the low - frequency turbulence of the wind can be described in the framework of the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model of plasma ( see for example  @xcite for ordinary fluid and mhd turbulence ) .",
    "turbulent high amplitude fluctuations have been observed from data , and it is well known now that solar wind plasma is in a highly turbulent state  @xcite .",
    "studies of solar wind turbulence have been mainly focused on the analysis of velocity and magnetic field data , for example observing the power spectra of such fields  @xcite , and later studying the anomalous statistics of the fields fluctuations , which revealed intermittency ( @xcite ) .",
    "only recently attention has been paid to the measurements of the interplanetary induced electric field ( ief ) @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 being respectively the measured velocity and magnetic field ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported on the statistics of ief collected from many different spacecrafts spanning 30 years of measurements .",
    "they analysed the one - point probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the ief fluctuations @xmath3 ( computed as a reynolds decomposition , _",
    "e. g. _ @xmath4 ) , and they found that such pdfs have exponential tails .",
    "this has been interpreted through a recent analytical result  @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that , a field that can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are independent stochastic variables with gaussian pdf , has exponential pdf .",
    "the cases of `` dynamo - type '' and `` cross helicity - type '' correlated gaussian pdfs for the @xmath10 s are also shown to give a modified exponential pdf for @xmath11 . since the interplanetary velocity and magnetic field components pdfs are roughly gaussian , results in  @xcite suggest that the data analysed by these authors satisfy the hypotheses on correlation required in  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we present a somewhat different data analysis , by considering the main statistical properties of the ief @xmath12 itself as computed from a more homogeneous dataset . at a variance with the ief fluctuations",
    ", we will see how correlations play a key role in invalidating the assumptions for the above results to hold , despite the fact that , from the same dataset , the same results as in  @xcite are retrived for the ief fluctuations @xmath13 .",
    "we then investigate for the first time the intermittency of interplanetary ief , which we expect to owe similar properties as for the interplanetary velocity and magnetic field .",
    "we do that through the analysis of the scaling laws of field fluctuations across different scales , which gives informations about the nonlinear processes undergoing the turbulent cascades of the ideal invariants of the flow .",
    "our results give a quantitative characterization of intermittency , which was not yet present in the literature .",
    "in order to study the statistical properties of the solar wind induced electric field , we use the velocity and magnetic fields , as measured _ in situ _ by the spacecraft helios  2 ( 1976 ) .",
    "helios  2 orbit lied in the ecliptic plane , so that the measured data include both fast and slow wind streams .",
    "since the physical conditions are very different , we analyse separately six fast and five slow wind streams  @xcite .",
    "this separation lead to more homogeneous data sets , although the radial evolution is not taken into account here . after separating the streams , and rejecting the velocity boundary regions between streams , which include undesired shear effects , the original dataset reduces to two sets of about @xmath14 points each .",
    "the sampling time is @xmath15  seconds , and each stream consists of 2187 points , so that we can investigate scaling in a range from about one minute up to one day .",
    "first of all , we compute the ief as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the measured velocity field , and @xmath18 is the measured magnetic field .",
    "the choice of the reference frame is not trivial .",
    "in fact , when analysing the velocity field the `` natural '' reference frame is the se ( with the @xmath19 axis along the sun - earth direction , which coincides with the mean velocity ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` natural '' frame for the magnetic field is with the @xmath19 axis along the mean field line , which is directed like the parker s spiral , and evolves with the heliocentric distance .",
    "note that @xmath20 axis lies on the ecliptic plane , while @xmath20 axis is choosen as normal to the ecliptic plane . since we have no arguments to decide whether a frame is better than the other in describing turbulent effects when analysing the induced electric field , we perform the analysis using both frames , and we compare the results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] we present the pdfs of the electric field . in order to compare the shape of the pdfs we have previously translated and normalized the variables to their standard deviation , so that all pdfs have zero mean and unit standard deviation .",
    "the plots refer to the field components in @xmath21 and @xmath22 frames .",
    "the pdfs for the @xmath23 and @xmath20 components are roughly gaussians for both frames , and the same holds for the magnitude @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath19 component , aligned either to the radial direction ( @xmath25 ) or to the mean field ( @xmath26 ) , presents a different statistics , depending on the reference frame . in particular , both in fast and in slow wind , the electric field component along @xmath22 is distributed as a gaussian . on the other side ,",
    "the pdfs of the electric field component aligned to @xmath21 show exponetial tails , as observed for all components fluctuations in  @xcite .",
    "these observations can be quantitatively measured by computing the flatness of the pdfs .",
    "the flatness @xmath27 gives informations about the shape of the pdf of a variable @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , for a gaussian distribution @xmath29 .",
    "values of the flatness larger than 3 indicate a fatter pdf , namely with higher tails . for @xmath30 , conversely , the pdf has faster decaying tails .",
    "the values of the flatness computed from data are in the range @xmath31@xmath32 , except for the electric field component along the bulk velocity ( radial direction ) which has @xmath33 , for fast and @xmath34 for slow wind .",
    "this confirm the direct observation of the pdfs .",
    "it is worth noting that no difference can be seen here between fast and slow streams .",
    "however , the separation in fast and slow streams allow for a comparison between more homogeneous datasets . we note here that the rotation of the reference frame do not affect the @xmath23 and @xmath20 components ,",
    "so we only report here the results obtained in the bulk velocity frame .    in order to compare our datasets with the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also analysed the statistics of the field fluctuations @xmath13 .",
    "our results ( not shown ) are in agreement with  @xcite , namely , we find exponential pdfs for all components , and with no remarkable differences between the different reference frames .",
    "in recent years , the solar wind velocity and magnetic field intermittency has been studied in detail by several autors  @xcite .",
    "one suitable approach to intermittency is the study of the fields increments  @xcite , defined as @xmath35 .",
    "such variables are used to describe the presence of structures of the field @xmath36 at a given scale @xmath37 , as for example eddies , shears , strong gradients , shocks and so on .",
    "thus , the statistical properties of the field increments can give informations about the turbulent energy cascade mechanism , responsible for the emergence of structures on a wide range of scales .",
    "in this paper we show that the induced electric field as measured in the solar wind plasma is characterized by intermittency . to this aim , we compute the pdfs of the increments @xmath38 , where the temporal lags @xmath39 are used instead of the lenght scales @xmath37 via the taylor hypothesis . the intermittency effects can be observed as the departure from scaling invariance of the normalized pdfs of the field increments  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_int ] shows the distributions @xmath40 for the slow wind , computed for three different values of the scale .",
    "the pdfs clearly display intermittency . in order to investigate more quantitatively such behavior ,",
    "we can analyse the scale dependence of the flatness ( see above ) . figure  [",
    "fig : flat ] reports the values of the flatness of the induced electric field components and magnitude increments , for both fast and slow wind . as can be seen , the small scale increments have high flatness , while the gaussian value @xmath29 is recovered as the scale increases .",
    "this does not hold for the radial component of the field , for which the asymptotic value of @xmath41 at large scales is considerably higher than for the other components .",
    "this is easily understood considering that the large scale pdf should reproduce the one - point statistics of the field , which is not gaussian for the @xmath25 component , as we have shown before .",
    "= 8.0 cm = 8.0 cm    the values of the small scale flatness are also higher for the slow wind than for the fast wind .",
    "this indicates a higher intermittency in slow wind electric field , and is in accord with previous results on velocity and magnetic field ( see e. g. @xcite ) . for a better characterization of intermittency",
    ", we use a model for pdf scaling to fit the measured distributions , and then study the scaling properties of the parameters obtained from such model  @xcite .",
    "the model pdf we use here has already been adopted to investigate intermittency in solar wind velocity and magnetic field , for example in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shortly describe the main idea underlying the model , and we address the reader to the quoted papers for a more detailed description . in a multifractal picture of turbulence ( see for example  @xcite ) , the pdf of the field increments at a given scale can be interpreted as the superposition of many pdfs , each one describing the statistics of the field inside a well defined ( fractal ) subset of the field .",
    "then , the resulting pdf can be computed as the sum of such partial pdfs , each one weighted by its relative occurrence in the field .",
    "this view is supported by the conditional analysis of the solar wind magnetic field increments  @xcite .",
    "the model pdf can be built up by introducing a parent distribution , describing the statistics inside each subsets , and a distribution for the weights of the parent distributions .",
    "the parent distribution is the large scale distribution of the field increments , so that , as can be checked in figure  [ fig : pdfs ] , we choose a gaussian @xmath42 ( @xmath43 being the standard deviation ) .",
    "the scale - dependent weights pdf is introduced as the distribution @xmath44 of the widths @xmath43 , so that the global pdf can be obtained by computing the convolution of the parent distributions ( of variable width @xmath43 ) with the distribution of their weights .",
    "the distribution @xmath44 could be in principle observed directely from the data , by performing a conditioned analysis .",
    "unfortunately , helios  2 dataset is not large enough to allow for this kind of analysis , so that the shape of @xmath44 has to be defined by some theoretical arguments . as in  @xcite , we use a log - normal function @xmath45 , whose width @xmath46 determine the shape of the global pdf .",
    "in fact for @xmath47 the log - normal pdf is a @xmath48-function , so that the convolution gives the parent distribution ( gaussian ) . as @xmath46 increases",
    ", the convolution includes more and more different values of @xmath43 , and with a more and more important weight , so that the tails of the resulting pdf raise .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_int ] presents the model pdfs fitted to the data .",
    "as can be seen the model reproduces in a satisfactory way the scaling evolution of the pdfs .",
    "the scaling properties of the parameter @xmath46 represent an useful tool to characterize quantitatively the intermittency  @xcite . since in fully developed turbulence @xmath49 display power - law behavior",
    ", it turns out that the scaling properties of the pdfs , and thus intermittency , can be labeled by a pair of parameters , namely : the scaling exponent @xmath50 , and the maximum value @xmath51 reached inside the scaling range .",
    "figure  [ fig : lam2 ] shows the scaling of the parameter @xmath52 obtained from the fit of pdfs , while in table  [ table : cast ] we collect the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 obtained from the fit with a power - law of @xmath52 , in a given range of scales .",
    "this has been already done for solar wind velocity and magnetic field  @xcite , and we report here these results for comparison ( see table  [ table : cast ] ) . as for velocity and magnetic field ,",
    "the statistical features of the induced electric field are thus well described by the multifractal model .",
    "the scaling properties of @xmath46 are evident and suggest the presence of an intermittent turbulent cascade of the ideal invariants ( energy , magnetic helicity , cross - elicity ) . from values of the parameter",
    "reported in table  [ table : cast ] , we can observe that the intermittency is more active than for the wind velocity , as in the case of the magnetic field .",
    "higher values of @xmath51 , in fact , indicate a higher non - gaussianity of small scale pdfs , which in turn indicate a larger presence of intermittent structures in the flow .",
    "the values of the slope @xmath50 are small , indicating a slow , not very efficient cascade mechanism .",
    "the fact that @xmath53 component values of @xmath50 are smaller than for the @xmath23 component is again related to the non - gaussian large scale statistics of the field : structures are already present at middle - range scales , and the range of variation of @xmath52 results smaller .",
    "= 8.0 cm = 8.0 cm    .we report the values of the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath50 obtained from the fitting procedure for @xmath52 of the pdf of increments with the multifractal model , for the solar wind induced electric field . for comparison , results for the longitudinal velocity and magnetic field increments are also reported . in all cases ,",
    "the reference frame is with @xmath53 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : cast ]",
    "we have analysed some statistical properties of the interplanetary induced electric field , as measured by helios  2 spacecraft .",
    "the data we used are selected so that our samples are homogeneous with respect to velocity and solar activity .",
    "the one - point statistics of pdfs of the ief components are gaussian , except for the radial component , which shows exponential tails .",
    "this result may indicate that hypotheses on correlations , required for the analytical results in  @xcite , do not hold in the solar wind for the induced electric field .",
    "however , exponential pdfs are found found when considering the ief associated with the magnetic field and velocity fluctuations .",
    "this result is in agreement with ref .",
    "we wish to point out that , in the present work , we separate fast from slow wind , since the statistical properties of slow and fast wind had been shown to be different  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relatively short - time range covered by the helios 2 data ( about one year ) prevent from the mixing of different solar activity levels , wich could lead to lack of stationarity of turbulence .",
    "the analysis of pdfs of the ief increments at different scales provides the characterization of intermittency .",
    "we performed such analysis using a multifractal model pdf ( castaing distribution ) and fitting the model to data , in order to obtain the characterizing parameters .",
    "the scaling properties of such parameters are shown in figures  [ fig : lam2 ] , that , together with figure  [ fig : flat ] , evidences and quantifies the typical evolution of the statistics , from the large scale parent ( one - point ) distribution , to the high - flatness ( high @xmath46 ) , high - tailed small scales statistics .",
    "a power - law behaviour is found for @xmath46 for two orders of magnitude , in the region between @xmath54 minute and @xmath54@xmath55 hours , that can be view as the inertial range of the turbulent cascading quantities .",
    "this range coincides with previos results obtained from the analysis of velocity and magnetic field turbulence ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and confirm one more time the intermittent , turbulent nature of solar wind fluctuations .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath50 , collected in table  [ table : cast ] , can be interpreted in terms of the topology of the most intermittent structures  @xcite .",
    "this could then be observed directely from the data , by extracting such structures  @xcite , and then comparing the results .",
