    "liquids consist of assemblies of many particles .",
    "there is long history to study molecular liquids which consist of non - dissipative simple molecules @xcite . in these days",
    ", there has been rapid growing interest in granular liquids which are made of granular assemblies , i.e. , dissipative macroscopic particles @xcite .",
    "although a molecular liquid is fluctuated around an equilibrium state , the absence of the equilibrium state of granular assemblies makes granular materials unlike usual materials @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have recognized that statistical properties and hydrodynamic behaviors of moderate dense and nearly elastic granular gases are considerably understood from the analysis of the kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "boltzmann - enskog theory is often used in describing moderate dense gases including granular assemblies , where the assumption of molecular chaos is used @xcite . in spite of the success of qualitative description of hydrodynamic behaviors based on boltzmann - enskog theory ,",
    "significant roles of correlations have been recognized in these days .",
    "indeed , it is well known that correlated collisions cause significant differences in constitutive equations even in equilibrium gases . in particular , recently a number of papers on long - time tails in current correlation functions for granular liquids have been published , which are directly related to the transport coefficients @xcite . on the other hand , we know the existence of long - range correlations in sheared elastic fluids @xcite and heat conduction systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of a similar long - range correlation has been observed even in a simulation of sheared granular fluids @xcite . in spite of the indication of the existence of the long - range correlations in sheared fluids",
    ", we do not have any consistent theory in describing a structure factor for both the particle scale and the hydrodynamic scale .",
    "indeed , a theoretical prediction of spatial correlations in the molecular scale for relatively dense liquids under a shear is not consistent with the long - range correlations @xcite .",
    "thus , we still do not understand the details of spatial correlations even in the case of molecular liquids .",
    "we often use the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) in describing dense liquids @xcite .",
    "even when we are interested in sheared dense granular liquids , the framework of mct can be used @xcite . however , mct is not a closed theory , because it needs to determine the structure factor by another method .",
    "thus , to obtain the structure factor or the pair - correlation function is an important issue for the description of dense granular liquids .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , thus , to clarify the spatial correlation functions for sheared isothermal liquids .",
    "based on the generalized fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite , we will demonstrate that the long - range correlation obeying a power law is consistent with the short - range structure obtained by a liquid theory . in the next section",

    ", we show the explicit form of @xmath2 which is the fourier component of the momentum correlation . in appendix e",
    ", we evaluate the asymptotic form of a function @xmath3 which is needed for the calculation of correlation functions .",
    "we consider three - dimensional systems consisting of @xmath4 identical smooth and hard spherical particles confined in the volume @xmath5 under a shear flow with the shear rate @xmath6 , where each particle has the mass @xmath7 and the diameter @xmath8 .",
    "the particles collide instantaneously with each other by a restitution constant @xmath9 which is less than unity for granular particles , and is equal to unity for molecular liquids .",
    "let us assume that the restitution coefficient @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "the spatial correlations in sheared fluids are investigated by using the fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite which can be used for the description of hydrodynamic behaviors .",
    "however , it is possible to generalize the fluctuating hydrodynamics which can cover the scale around the particle diameter .",
    "the generalized hydrodynamic equations @xcite for isothermal liquids characterized by a uniform temperature @xmath10 are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the number density and @xmath14-component of the velocity field , respectively .",

    "we have used einstein s sum rule on the greek subscript . the generalized shear viscosity @xmath26 and the generalized bulk viscosity @xmath27",
    "are represented by @xmath28 , @xmath29 and enskog s mean free time @xmath30 with the radial distribution function @xmath31 at contact as @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the average number density , fourier transforms of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "therefore , we are keeping discussion without their explicit forms .    it should be noted that sheared corrections to the structure factor or the pair - correlation function",
    "can be obtained within this theoretical framework , though the equilibrium or the unsheared structure factor @xmath43 should be determined by another method .",
    "we adopt an approximate expression of the pair - correlation function for unsheared granular liquids obtained by lutsko @xcite , which covers the equilibrium pair - correlation in the elastic limit ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this set of equations - is a reasonable starting point for isothermal molecular liquids ( @xmath44 ) , once we use appropriate generalized transport coefficients and @xmath45 .",
    "however , the validity of this set of equations in describing isothermal sheared granular fluids might be controversial .",
    "indeed , nobody has used the generalized fluctuating hydrodynamics for granular liquids , because we know that fluctuations can not be characterized by gaussian .",
    "in addition , there are no explicit characteristics of granular liquids in the set of equations except for @xmath9-dependence of @xmath18 and the generalized transport coefficients .",
    "even when we use the hydrodynamic equations for granular liquids , we should consider an equation for the granular temperature .",
    "let us answer the above critical points to validate the generalized fluctuating hydrodynamics in eqs . - .",
    "first , the granular temperature @xmath10 is not a true hydrodynamic variable but a relatively fast variable because of the collisional energy loss in granular systems .",
    "thus , we expect the fast relaxation to a steady state of the temperature for sheared granular liquids , which satisfies @xmath46 .",
    "second , an isothermal situation is easily realized by the balance between the viscous heating and the collisional energy loss . in particular , it is known that usf is stable for small and nearly elastic systems under lees - edwards boundary condition . even in physical situations ,",
    "the heat conduction is not important in the bulk region far from the boundary . in these situations",
    ", we may assume that sheared granular liquids are nearly isothermal .",
    "we also indicate that our previous studies clarify the formal similarities between sheared granular liquids and sheared molecular liquids at a constant temperature @xcite . through previous studies",
    ", we have recognized that the most important issue is to determine @xmath18 for granular liquids @xcite , which can be determined within the framework of the generalized fluctuating hydrodynamics .",
    "third , the fluctuating hydrodynamics has been used in describing granular hydrodynamics for freely cooling cases @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that the set of equations - can be used even for sheared granular liquids .",
    "although there are uncovered regions of our approach in the description of granular liquids , we expect that our approach can capture some aspects of sheared granular liquids .",
    "the validity of the model will be tested from the comparison between our theoretical prediction and the direct simulation of granular assemblies .",
    "in this section , we analyze a set of the linearized equations around usf .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we assume that usf is stable .",
