    "the primary goal of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at bnl rhic and at cern lhc is to study the properties of a deconfined state of the qcd matter , commonly known as quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) . according to lattice calculation",
    ", the novel state of matter is expected to be formed when the temperature of the nuclear matter is raised to the critical value @xmath0mev , or the energy density of the nuclear matter is raised to above 1 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "high energy partons behave as hard probes which are produced in the early stage of the collision due to hard scattering . in relativistic heavy - ion collision jets with high transverse momentum",
    "travels through the hot and dense medium and it losses energy by collisional(interaction with thermal quark and gluon ) and radiative processes(bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "this phenomena is commonly known as jet quenching , because in the direction of propagation of the jet one observes a decrease of high energy hadrons and increase in the number of soft hadrons .",
    "in addition , the passage of jet influences the collective modes of the system as we shall see below .    in refs",
    "@xcite , the effect of a jet of particle on the plasma properties , propagated through the equilibrated and isotropic qgp has been analyzed , where initial configuration of jet is assumed to be colorless , electrically neutral and described by tsunami - like distribution  @xcite in momentum space .",
    "non - equilibrium jet of particles while traveling through qgp destabilizes the plasma producing the collective gauge fields .",
    "these gauge modes might have several branches and some of these might even be unstable .",
    "the most important among those are the modes which grow exponentially in time .",
    "when the instability occurs , the kinetic energy of the particles is converted to the field energy which speeds up the equilibration process and also leads to faster isotropization  @xcite of the qgp .",
    "the main assumption for such phenomenon to occur is that the time to generate the growth of the gauge fields is smaller than the hadronization time .",
    "plasma instabilities fully develop on the time scale of the order of @xmath2@xcite , where @xmath3 is the total angular frequency of the whole system . in a weak coupling regime ,",
    "the time scale is @xmath4 fm / c at @xmath5mev .    in the present work",
    "we shall concentrate on the collective modes in aqgp induced by relativistic jets . in the early stage of heavy - ion collision due to rapid longitudinal expansion",
    ", the plasma cools faster in the longitudinal direction leading to @xmath6 .",
    "such momentum - space anisotropy leads to collective modes having characteristic behavior distinct from what happens in isotropic plasma which has been extensively studied in  @xcite where it is shown that the gluonic collective modes can be unstable . when a relativistic stream of particles interact with the non - equilibrium plasma , with an anisotropic distribution in momentum space , the behavior of collective modes change as will be demonstrated in the following .    in studying the evolution of such a system ,",
    "we use the method of the plasma physics within the frame work of the quark - gluon transport theory  @xcite in weak coupling regime , i.e. @xmath7 . the time scale for the evolution of collective modes is assumed to be much shorter than the inter - particle collision time . in this approach",
    "we have neglected hard mode interactions , assuming that the interactions between jet and plasma is only mediated by mean gauge fields .",
    "kinetic instability can occur due to the interaction of plasma and jet partons .",
    "they are initiated either by charge or current fluctuation . in the first case ,",
    "the electric field is longitudinal i.e. the field is parallel to the wave vector @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , while in the second case the field is perpendicular to @xmath8 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "for this reason the corresponding instabilities are called longitudinal and transverse instabilities respectively . since the electric field plays a crucial role in the generation of longitudinal modes , they are also called electric modes , while the transverse modes are called magnetic modes . the magnetic mode known as filamentation- or weibel - instability  @xcite appears to be relevant for the qgp  @xcite . in momentum - space anisotropic plasma ,",
    "the growth rate of magnetic instability is maximum in the direction of anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "so we concentrate on this special case in which the momentum of the collective mode is in the direction of the anisotropy .",
    "we expect that the dispersion relations will be affected due to the passage of jet in aqgp .",
    "in fact , we shall see that the growth rate of unstable modes first increases compared to the case of no jet scenario and then becomes damped .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly recapitulate vlasov - type transport equation for the colored particles . in section 3 and 4",
    "we shall show how the dispersion relations are modified in the presence of a tsunami like jet .",
    "section 5 will be devoted to discuss the results followed by summary in section 6 .",
    "transport theory provides a natural framework to study equilibrium and non equilibrium plasmas .",
    "we review the transport equations obeyed by the distribution of colored particles and the classical fields .",
    "the ( anti)quark distribution functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are @xmath13 hermitian matrices , belong to the fundamental representation of the @xmath14 group .",
    "the gluons are the adjoint representation of @xmath14 , and their distribution function @xmath15 is a @xmath16 matrix in color space .",
    "the partials of jet consisting only quarks , and the corresponding distribution function can be described by a @xmath13 matrix in color space as @xmath17 . in the fundamental representation , the color four - current @xmath18 is expresses as j^(x)=&-&_p p^[current ] where @xmath19 with @xmath20 are the @xmath14 group generator in the fundamental and adjoint representations with @xmath21=\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab}$ ] , @xmath22=n_c\\delta^{ab}$ ] and @xmath23 is the qcd coupling constant .",

    "therefore the collision terms @xmath32 and @xmath33 are neglected .",
    "the characteristic time scale  @xcite of the system s evolution due to interparton collision is @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "so our current approximations are really only valid for time intervals shorter then @xmath36 .    in this work",
    "we will also assume that initially the plasma is colorless and in thermally equilibrated state .",
    "considering the distribution functions are deviation from their equilibrium states we have , f(p , x)=n_fd(*p*)+f(p , x ) , +    g(p , x)=n_be(*p*)+(p , x ) , where n_fd / be(*p*)= are the fermi - dirac and bose - einstein equilibrium distribution functions .",

    "such an htl propagator was first derived in  @xcite in the temporal - axial gauge .",

    "now , we shall briefly recall the calculation of the polarization tensor induced by the tsunami - like momentum distribution of the jet given by eq.([td ] ) . substituting eq.([td ] ) in eq.([dt ] ) one deduces the following expression of the polarization tensor for the jet partons : ^ij_jet(k)=-^2_jet(^ij+- ) , + where @xmath74 is the velocity of jet and @xmath75 is the plasma frequency of the jet .",
    "the dispersion laws of the collective modes of the system due to jet are determined by searching the poles of the propagator of eq.([pole ] ) by replacing @xmath76 with @xmath77 i.e. by finding the solution @xmath78 .",

    "it is seen that the collective modes with the jet differs reasonably from that without the jet .",

    "this is displayed in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath90 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath86 .",
    "it is found that the dispersion relation is sensitive to @xmath91 . in order to see the dependence of the collective modes on the jet velocity @xmath74",

    "we find significant difference in the collective modes with and without jet .",
    "however we do not find any significant dependence of the @xmath97-modes on the jet velocity(see in fig.[fig7 ] ) . from fig.[fig8",
    "] , it is clearly seen that the dispersion relation depends on the parameter @xmath94 and the modes are strongly modified by this parameter .",
    "the collective modes also depend on the angle of propagation with respect to the anisotropy vector , @xmath72 as depicted in fig.[fig9 ] .",

    "the collective mode for @xmath99-mode is also marginally sensitive to the jet velocity . in fig.[fig12 ] , it is observed that the dispersion relation for @xmath99-mode strongly depends on the direction of the anisotropy axis .      in the static limit , for small @xmath72",
    "both the scale @xmath102 and @xmath103 are negative and so also @xmath104 .",
    "it indicates that the whole system is unstable with respect to magnetic instability  @xcite .",
    "this can be identified as the so called filamentation or weibel instability  @xcite .",
    "the instability is driven by the energy transferred from the particles to the field .",
    "the growth rate of the filamentation instabilities is largest when the wave vector is along the beam line , i.e. , @xmath105  @xcite in which case @xmath60 and @xmath96 vanish identically .",
    "therefor the dispersion relations for the unstable modes are determined by the solutions of the following equations : ^2-*k*^2-()-^()&=&0 + ^2-()-^()&=&0    in the numerical simulation we find that unstable mode exits only for @xmath106 mode in the special case@xmath107 considered here . to solve the dispersion relation for the unstable @xmath106 mode we first consider @xmath108 and it is found that @xmath109 is purely imaginary i.e. @xmath110 with @xmath111 real valued .",
    "results for different values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath85 are shown in fig.[figu1 ] .",
    "it is observed that instability first increases in comparison to the no jet case and then it becomes damped . to find the maximum value of the momentum @xmath112 at which the unstable mode spectrum terminates , we take the limit @xmath113 , to obtain(@xmath108 ) , k^2_max = ^2_jet+m_d^2",
    "we shall now consider @xmath91 dependence of the unstable modes .",
    "for nonzero @xmath91 we find that collective modes are unstable propagating modes i.e. @xmath114 . in fig.[figu2 ] we plot the imaginary part of the dispersion law of the unstable @xmath106-mode for four different @xmath91 .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath111 first increases with @xmath91 and then turns into damping except @xmath87 in which case the unstable mode always grows .",
    "it is interesting to see that when @xmath87 , the maximum value of @xmath111 decreases and it never becomes damped .",
    "the growth rate dependence on the parameter @xmath115 corresponding to the value of the @xmath90 and @xmath108 is displayed in fig.[figu3 ] .",
    "it is seen that instability grows with @xmath94 .",
    "we have calculated the dispersion relation of modes ( both stable and unstable ) due to the passage of relativistic jets in an anisotropic plasma .",
    "it is seen that the dispersion relations of stable modes in an aqgp are modified due to the introduction of relativistic jet compared to the case when there is no jet .",
    "dependences of possible modes on the direction of propagation of the jet and anisotropy direction have been demonstrated .",
    "we have also shown that the growth rate @xmath111 increases with the passage of jet and this growth rate strongly depends on the anisotropy parameter @xmath48 .",
    "this means that the introduction of jet in an aqgp leads to faster isotropization for the special case @xmath116 considered here .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the growth rate for @xmath87 never becomes damped .",
    "we also find no unstable for @xmath117-mode in the special case .",
    "however , it remains to be seen how the unstable modes behave when a more general case(arbitrary @xmath72 ) is considered .",
