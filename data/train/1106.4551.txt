    "within gauge / gravity duality , asymptotically ads black hole solutions and their stability properties play a crucial role since black holes are dual to thermal states on the field theory side . in particular , the stability of black holes is connected to the stability of the thermal state . in recent years",
    ", it was found that many asymptotically ads black holes are unstable , forming hair @xcite .",
    "the most prominent examples are charged ads black holes which are unstable against condensation of scalar @xcite or gauge fields @xcite .",
    "the condensate arising from a scalar or gauge field is a holographic description of a superfluid with scalar or vector condensates , respectively .    in this letter",
    "we report on a new type of instability of anti - de sitter black holes in @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills theory .",
    "our analysis is motivated by recent field theory studies within qcd @xcite , where it has been proposed that a strong magnetic field may generate @xmath1 meson condensation and superconductivity in the qcd vacuum - boson condensation induced by a strong magnetic field @xcite ] .",
    "essentially , in these papers it has been argued that in a strong magnetic field , a gluon - mediated attraction between quarks and antiquarks of different flavour leads to a colourless spin - triplet bound state with quantum numbers of an electrically charged @xmath2 meson .",
    "these quark - antiquark pairs condense to form a new ground state . within gauge / gravity duality ,",
    "a similar result has been obtained in the sakai - sugimoto model in @xcite , also at zero temperature as in the field theory computation .    in this letter",
    "we find supporting evidence for this qcd proposal by considering a suitable model within gauge / gravity duality at finite temperature .",
    "the holographic model considered is @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills theory in @xmath3-dimensions . in the presence of a background @xmath4 field",
    ", we do indeed find an instability , corresponding to the formation of vector hair in the gravity theory .",
    "in addition to the motivation from qcd described above , the result is also of more general relevance in the context of gravity and gauge / gravity duality . whereas the qcd result has been obtained at zero temperature",
    ", here we consider the finite temperature case .",
    "in fact , the model we consider is a simple modification of the p - wave holographic superconductor , first discussed in @xcite , in which there is a vector condensate in the background of a chemical potential and density turned on by considering a non - trivial radial profile for the temporal component @xmath5 of the gauge field in the gravity theory . in addition , a p - wave superconductor for which the dual field theory is explicitly known has been constructed in @xcite by embedding a probe of two coincident d7-branes , corresponding to two flavours , into the ads - schwarzschild black hole background .",
    "this string - theoretical top - down approach lets one identify the su(2 ) chemical potential as an isospin chemical potential and the condensate as a @xmath1 meson . a p - wave holographic model which includes",
    "the back - reaction of the gauge field on the metric in the @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills model has been considered in @xcite .    here",
    "we show that a similar condensation occurs also when a _ spatial _ component @xmath6 of the background @xmath0 gauge field , corresponding to an external @xmath4 field , has a non - trivial profile instead of the _ temporal _ component @xmath5 in the isospin chemical potential case .",
    "we find the corresponding holographic phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "for this we analyse the fluctuation quasinormal modes and find that they display an instability .",
    "we confirm this result by performing a schrdinger potential analysis .",
    "moreover we comment on the expected form of the condensate , the explicit calculation of which we leave for the future .",
    "we consider @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills theory in @xmath3-dimensional asymptotically ads space .",
    "the action is @xmath7+s_{\\text{bdy}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the five - dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the cosmological constant , with @xmath10 being the ads radius , and @xmath11 is the yang - mills coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath0 field strength @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the ads radial coordinate , and @xmath16 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 are the components of the matrix - valued gauge field , @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 are the @xmath0 generators , which are related to the pauli matrices by @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 includes boundary terms that do not affect the equations of motion , namely the gibbons - hawking boundary term as well as counterterms required for the on - shell action to be finite .",
    "the einstein and yang - mills equations derived from the above action are @xmath23 where the yang - mills stress - energy tensor @xmath24 is @xmath25 in order to simplify the calculation we will from now on exclusively consider the probe limit @xmath26 thus the metric at finite temperature is given by an ads schwarzschild black hole @xmath27 with blackening factor @xmath28 .",
    "the hawking temperature of this black hole is given by @xmath29 .",
    "due to the probe limit we now only have to consider the @xmath0 gauge fields living in this fixed background .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a constant flavour magnetic field @xmath30 which solves the yang - mills equation of motion  . choosing the magnetic field in",
    "the @xmath31-direction breaks the rotational symmetry @xmath32 down to @xmath33 while choosing the third flavour direction breaks the @xmath0 symmetry down to @xmath34 symmetry generated by @xmath35 rotations .",
    "we call this @xmath34 symmetry @xmath36",
    ". we may choose a gauge where only @xmath37 is non - zero ( see  [ sec : constructing - gauge - covariant ] ) .",
    "a system which is close to equilibrium can be described by linear response theory . there",
    "the effect of an external perturbation is given by the convolution of the retarded two - point function with the source of the perturbation .",
    "due to the cauchy integration formula , the response can be written as a sum over the poles of the two - point function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these poles can be identified with the different quasinormal modes of the black hole @xcite .",
    "quasinormal modes of a black hole are distinct perturbations of the black hole solution .",
    "they can be understood roughly as resonances of the black hole .",
    "however since the energy of the perturbation can leak into the black hole , these fluctuations are not normal modes and thus have been dubbed quasinormal . each quasinormal mode",
    "s corresponding frequency consists of a real and an imaginary part . as for the damped oscillator ,",
    "the real part of the frequency essentially determines the energy of the fluctuations , while the imaginary part is responsible for the damping . writing the time dependence as @xmath38",
    "we note that a relaxation towards equilibrium can only happen if all the quasinormal modes lie in the lower complex half plane . in ads",
    "spacetimes the quasinormal modes satisfy the following boundary conditions : at the horizon they are purely ingoing , whereas at the conformal ads boundary they have an asymptotic behaviour that corresponds to a normalisable mode .",
    "let us now study perturbations of the gauge fields @xmath39 about the equilibrium given by the magnetic field @xmath40 .",
    "as usual we fix a gauge by setting @xmath41 , which however leaves some residual gauge freedom .",
    "it is useful to consider combinations of the fluctuations @xmath39 which do not transform under the residual gauge transformations .",
    "these combinations are the physical modes of the system .",
    "first we define @xmath42 which are in the fundamental representation of @xmath36 while @xmath43 are of course in the adjoint ( see @xcite )",
    ". since fluctuations @xmath43 can not interact with the magnetic field , their equations of motion are the same as for zero magnetic field .",
    "thus we can not observe any instability there and we will consistently set @xmath44 .",
    "we can also consistently choose that the fluctuations have a dependence only on @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath15 .",
    "now we combine the fields @xmath47 in such a way that they are covariant under the residual gauge symmetries , they only transform as a fundamental field . using the fourier ansatz @xmath38 , this leads to the six gauge covariant fields , ( see  [ sec : constructing - gauge - covariant ] ) @xmath48    the equations of motion for @xmath49 , as derived from  ,",
    "are given by the coupled set of equations @xmath50 where the equations of motion for @xmath51 are obtained by complex conjugation .",
    "notice that it is consistent to switch off @xmath52 since then coincides with the constraint and the gauge covariant fields @xmath53 disappear .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath54 decouple from the above system since they are the only transverse modes and thus can be studied on their own .",
    "in order to find the instabilities of the system we determine the spectrum of the quasinormal modes and determine the critical value of the magnetic field @xmath4 for which the imaginary part of the quasinormal modes becomes positive .",
    "usually the crossing to the upper complex half plane occurs at the origin ( see @xcite ) which we also expect here . by considering the equations of motion  , we observe that @xmath55 decouple if @xmath56 .",
    "thus we can look for normalisable modes of these fluctuations for @xmath56 separately . since we can not find a normalisable mode for any magnetic field",
    ", we can conclude that the fluctuations @xmath55 do not trigger any instability .",
    "therefore we consider from now on @xmath57 which is consistent .    also , the equations of motion for @xmath54 decouple from all the other equations of motion since they are the transverse modes .",
    "we numerically checked that these fluctuations do not introduce an instability either .",
    "thus an instability can only come from the @xmath58 components , the quasinormal modes of which are studied in the following .",
    "for @xmath59 it can be shown that the set of equations   reduces to one equation of motion for @xmath60 , @xmath61 while @xmath62 is given by the constraint @xmath63 usually it is favourable to write down the equations of motion in terms of the gauge covariant fields  .",
    "that is also possible in this case , but here we obtain the solution for the gauge covariant field in terms of the solution for @xmath64 by using the constraint  , @xmath65 from this it is clear that the dependence on the radial coordinate @xmath15 is the same for both fields , and only the dependence on @xmath46 may change",
    ".    the solution for @xmath64 can be found by the separation of variables @xmath66 and its equation of motion   becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the separation constant .",
    "using  , the equation for @xmath69 and the fact that @xmath70 is separable , we find that @xmath71 this shows that the physical fields @xmath72 and @xmath73 have the same @xmath46-dependence and thus are equivalent up to a constant . in solving for @xmath69",
    ", we will have to impose boundary conditions that ensure that the @xmath72 vanish asymptotically and are regular . as we will find out",
    ", they have an overall factor of @xmath74 .    the equation for @xmath69",
    "can be solved analytically .",
    "after the definition @xmath75 and @xmath76 we obtain kummer s equation @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the solution is given by the linear combination of the confluent hypergeometric function of first kind @xmath80 and of the second kind @xmath81 .",
    "the function @xmath82 can also be written in terms of @xmath83 such that the complete solution is given by the linear combination @xmath84 in order to have a vanishing solution for @xmath72 ( and thus for @xmath69 ) at @xmath85 , @xmath86 is only allowed to grow slower than the factor of @xmath87 since @xmath88 .",
    "looking at the asymptotic expansion for large @xmath89 , @xmath90 we see that @xmath86 does grow too fast unless @xmath91 diverges , which is to say that @xmath92 for a non - negative integer @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath92 then @xmath80 reduces to a laguerre polynomial @xmath94 , which has @xmath93 positive roots .",
    "we expect that the free energy of the system increases with the number of the roots .",
    "since we are looking for the lowest energy solution and the second solution in   always has a root at @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96 .",
    "the first solution has no zero if @xmath97 .",
    "this determines @xmath98 where the normalisation is set by @xmath99 .",
    "we thus find that @xmath100    unfortunately the equation for @xmath101 can only be solved numerically .",
    "using a shooting method we may find its quasinormal modes and determine the dependence of their frequencies on the magnetic field . in order to have dimensionless quantities we define @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath104 the quasinormal frequencies are given by @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the quasinormal frequencies on the magnetic field is given in figure  [ fig : polemovement ] .",
    "we observe that for the magnetic field @xmath106 , the quasinormal frequency moves into the upper half plane , which signals an instability .    .",
    "the two lowest order frequencies start at @xmath107 .",
    "they move towards the imaginary axis , merge , then split again .",
    "the merging happens when @xmath108 .",
    "one pole then moves downward , away from 0 and outside the range of the figure .",
    "the other , which is drawn , moves towards 0 and eventually crosses the real axis when @xmath109.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      there are two further ways of qualitatively understanding the formation of an instability that leads to a superconducting condensate .",
    "the first is by looking at the form that the on - shell action takes in our setup . to see an instability we actually only need to switch on the fields @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . to second order ,",
    "the relevant part of the action becomes @xmath113   \\bigg\\}\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] solving the @xmath46-dependence , we obtain @xmath114 and equation   gives @xmath115 which translates to @xmath116 .",
    "this means that , to second order , the on - shell action is @xmath117\\,,\\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have integrated out the @xmath46 component , absorbed a factor of @xmath118 into @xmath119 for the canonical normalisation and dropped a constant term .",
    "the important thing to notice is that the gauge field has picked up an effective mass term , @xmath120 , and it becomes more and more negative as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this suggests a tachyonic mode leading to the spontaneous formation of a condensate .",
    "in contrast to the instability at finite chemical potential @xcite , the instability here does not arise due to the presence of a horizon , @xmath121 is not involved in the negative effective mass term .      to understand the instability better , we can rewrite the equation of motion in the form of a schrdinger equation ( see @xcite ) , @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the tortoise coordinate @xmath125 and the schrdinger potential are given by @xmath126 @xmath127 can not be inverted analytically and so we have to study @xmath128 numerically .",
    "the profile of the schrdinger potential for different values of the magnetic field @xmath129 is given in figure  [ fig : schroedpotential ] .",
    "for all values of the magnetic field we observe an infinite wall at @xmath130 due to the boundary of the ads space and a vanishing potential at @xmath131 due to the black hole horizon . in between a potential",
    "well opens up as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "for a large enough magnetic field , this potential allows for bound states with negative energy .",
    "the first such bound state implies that a quasinormal frequency has crossed the real line and developed a positive imaginary part .",
    "this bound state therefore first forms at the critical magnetic field that produces an instability .    .",
    "it is helpful to compare this with figure  [ fig : polemovement ] . from top to bottom , the curves show the potential at the values @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the first curve shows the potential when there is no magnetic field , the second one is for the value of @xmath129 at which the poles merge on the imaginary axis , the third is for the value at which the first pole crosses the real axis , and the final value is to see what the potential does at higher @xmath129 .",
    "we see that a potential well forms with negative potential energy .",
    "the value @xmath134 is roughly where the curve first dips below zero , which is where the poles in figure  [ fig : polemovement ] merge.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the reason why a bound state with negative energy implies an instability is due to the ingoing boundary condition at the horizon .",
    "this boundary condition implies that the time - independent part of the mode goes like @xmath135 . outside the potential",
    "well , the mode has to decay exponentially towards the horizon .",
    "combining these two constraints means that @xmath136 must have a positive imaginary part .",
    "thus the appearance of the bound state in the schrdinger picture agrees with the quasinormal frequency crossing the real axis .    using the schrdinger potential we can also estimate the critical b - field @xmath137 above which the system gets unstable . using a wkb approximation",
    ", we can estimate that a ( zero - energy ) bound state will appear for @xmath138 where @xmath139 @xmath140 is the zero of @xmath128 and thus @xmath128 is negative for @xmath141 the corresponding zero of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath15 is called @xmath143 @xmath144 note that @xmath145 and therefore also @xmath146 depend on @xmath147 the minimal value for @xmath129 where the potential develops a zero is at @xmath148 .",
    "this coincides with the value at which the quasinormal modes merge at the negative imaginary axis up to an error of 2% .",
    "in order to obtain the critical magnetic field we need to know when a bound state can be formed .",
    "we are only interested in the first bound state and therefor set @xmath149 solving the integral equation numerically for @xmath129 we obtain @xmath150 we see that the analysis of the schrdinger potential qualitatively agrees with the precise study of the quasinormal modes above up to an error of 4% .",
    "in this letter we have found an interesting instability of black holes in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "in particular we consider an einstein - yang - mills system with gauge group @xmath0 and with a negative cosmological constant such that ads is a solution .",
    "if we neglect the back - reaction of the gauge fields on the background metric , a solution of the equations of motion is given by an asymptotically schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in addition we turn on a magnetic field @xmath151 where @xmath35 is one of the three generators of @xmath0 . by investigating the fluctuations of the gauge field around the schwarzschild black hole",
    "we find that the system gets unstable above a critical value @xmath152 of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular we identify the quasinormal mode which crosses the real axis into the upper half plane .",
    "this result is confirmed in two different ways .",
    "first , we calculate an effective action for the fluctuations and show that these fluctuations get a negative mass squared , which drops below the breitenlohner - freedman bound for large enough magnetic fields .",
    "second , we rewrite the equations of motion into a schrdinger - like wave equation with an effective potential @xmath142 and show that @xmath142 has a bound state for large enough magnetic fields .",
    "the bound state signals the instability of the system .",
    "note that here we have turned on a magnetic field for one of the three generators of @xmath0 and not for a @xmath34 gauge group .",
    "one might think that this is not so common in gauge / gravity duality .",
    "however , as we now discuss , a similar structure @xcite also arises in the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the sakai - sugimoto setup with two flavours ( with electric charges @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) .",
    "the flavour degrees of freedom are described by two pairs of @xmath155-branes .",
    "part of the dynamics of the flavour degrees of freedom is therefore given by a non - abelian gauge theory with gauge group @xmath156 note that the gauge group on the gravity side corresponds to the dual flavour symmetry on the field theory side . in the sakai - sugimoto model the electromagnetic gauge group with generator @xmath157 is realised as a subgroup of @xmath156 thus in the case @xmath158 the magnetic field @xmath159 has a baryon and isospin component , i.e. @xmath160 although we aim to study the effect of the @xmath34 magnetic field @xmath161 we have to consider a non - vanishing magnetic field for the isospin component .",
    "note that already in @xcite , evidence was given that the vacuum at zero temperature is unstable for large enough magnetic fields .",
    "the results presented here indicate that such an instability arises not only in the sakai - sugimoto model but also in the simplest possible toy model at finite temperature for which we can explicitly study the quasinormal modes .",
    "the instability discussed in this paper gives rise to interesting questions on which we plan to work in the future .",
    "what is the true ground state of the system and what are its properties ?",
    "is it a superfluid state ?",
    "can we realise this ad hoc toy model in string theory ? by addressing these questions , we expect in particular to obtain further information about the qcd vacuum instability at finite @xmath4 field discussed in @xcite .",
    "as our results suggest , a more general form of this instability may occur also at finite temperature in non - confining field theories . on the gravity side",
    ", we expect the condensate to be a suitable combination of the gauge field components @xmath162 and @xmath163 .    it will also be interesting to repeat the analysis of this paper in four dimensions on the gravity side .",
    "this will allow for a comparison with @xcite , where instabilities of general spherically symmetric solutions of four - dimensional einstein - yang - mills - dilaton theories with a constant magnetic field strength on the sphere have been found .",
    "moreover , this will also allow for a comparison with @xcite , which raises the interesting question whether the instability found here is related to the existence of magnetic monopoles .",

    "in this appendix we show how to fix the gauge of the @xmath0 field in such a way that only a @xmath36 gauge freedom remains .",
