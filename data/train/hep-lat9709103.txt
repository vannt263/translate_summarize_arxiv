    "the fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues of the lattice dirac operator have attracted much attention recently . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was first demonstrated that they are described by random matrix theory ( rmt ) . in particular , the so - called nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1",
    ", i.e. , the distribution of spacings @xmath3 between adjacent eigenvalues , agrees with the wigner surmise of rmt . according to a conjecture by bohigas @xcite , quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic have a @xmath1 given by rmt whereas systems whose classical counterparts are integrable obey a poisson distribution , @xmath4 . in this sense ,",
    "the form of @xmath1 characterizes quantum chaos .    at the localization transition in disordered mesoscopic systems",
    ", one observes a transition in @xmath1 from wigner to poisson behavior .",
    "the question of whether there is such a transition in the case of the lattice dirac operator was first raised in ref .",
    "the present study serves to investigate this question .",
    "recently , a wigner to poisson transition was also studied in the context of a spatially homogeneous yang - mills - higgs system @xcite .",
    "the lattice dirac operator falls into one of three symmetry classes corresponding to the three chiral gaussian ensembles of rmt @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dirac matrix was studied for su(2 ) using both staggered and wilson fermions which correspond to the chiral gaussian symplectic ( chgse ) and orthogonal ( chgoe ) ensemble , respectively . here , we study su(3 ) which for both staggered and wilson fermions corresponds to the chiral gaussian unitary ensemble ( chgue ) .",
    "we thus cover the last remaining symmetry class . the rmt result for @xmath1 is quite complicated ; it can be expressed in terms of so - called prolate spheroidal functions , see ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath1 has also been tabulated . a very good approximation to @xmath1 is provided by @xmath5 which is the wigner surmise for the chgue .",
    "we generated gauge field configurations using the standard wilson plaquette action for su(3 ) and constructed the matrix of the dirac operator using the kogut - susskind prescription .",
    "the dirac matrix is anti - hermitian so that all eigenvalues are imaginary and occur in pairs with opposite sign .",
    "we have worked on a @xmath0 lattice with various values of @xmath2 and typically produced 10 independent configurations for each @xmath2 .",
    "all spectra were checked against the analytical sum rules @xmath6 where v is the lattice volume .    to construct @xmath1 ,",
    "one first has to `` unfold '' the spectra @xcite .",
    "this procedure is a @xmath7 rescaling of the energy scale so that the mean level spacing is equal to unity on the unfolded scale . ensemble and spectral averages ( the latter is possible because of the spectral ergodicity property of rmt ) are only meaningful after unfolding .",
    "our results are displayed in the plots .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the staircase function @xmath8 which is defined as the number of eigenvalues with @xmath9 . in the continuum , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spectral density .",
    "note that @xmath11 can not be obtained from a random - matrix model .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 compared with the rmt result . in the confinement phase , we find the expected agreement of @xmath1 with the wigner surmise of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in the deconfinement phase ,",
    "we still observe agreement with the rmt result up to @xmath12 .",
    "no signs for a transition to poisson behavior are found .",
    "thus , the deconfinement phase transition does not seem to coincide with a transition in the spacing distribution . for larger values of @xmath2",
    "the eigenvalues start to approach the degenerate eigenvalues of the free theory , given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lattice constant and @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution is trivial .",
    "however , it is possible to lift the degeneracies of the free eigenvalues using an asymmetric lattice where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .",
    "are relative primes .",
    "for large lattices , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the non - degenerate free eigenvalues is then given by the poisson distribution . while it may be interesting to search for a wigner to poisson transition on such asymmetric lattices , it seems clear that this transition will not coincide with the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "furthermore , we do not think that the absence of a signature for a transition from wigner to poisson behavior at the deconfinement phase transition is due to the finite lattice size .",
    "even for the small lattice size we used , the agreement of @xmath1 with the rmt curve is nearly perfect .",
    "this leads us to believe that we should have seen some sign of a transition if it existed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have searched for a transition in the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath1 from wigner to poisson behavior across the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "such a transition exists , e.g. , at the localization transition in disordered mesoscopic systems . in a yang - mills - higgs system a smooth transition along a brody distribution was seen @xcite .",
    "we found no signature of a transition in our lattice data .",
    "the data agree with the rmt result in both the confinement and the deconfinement phase except for extremely large values of @xmath2 where the eigenvalues are trivial .    in hindsight , these results are not totally unexpected .",
    "temporal monopole currents survive the deconfinement phase transition leading to confinement of spatial wilson loops .",
    "thus , even in the deconfinement phase , the gauge fields retain a certain degree of randomness . in future investigations",
    "one might try to disentangle those spatial contributions to the dirac matrix .",
