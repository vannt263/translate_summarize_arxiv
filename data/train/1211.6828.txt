    "when an extrasolar planet eclipses its host star , the event is referred to as a transit or primary eclipse . during a transit , observers can detect dips in starlight caused by the planet obscuring a portion of the stellar disk when it passes in front of the star .",
    "the transit method applies to those systems where the orbital inclination of a planet is close to @xmath4@xmath5  ( _ i.e. _  edge - on ) with respect to the observer s sky - plane .",
    "the first transit observations were made by @xcite . as of august 2012 ,",
    "more than 200 planets ( exoplanet.eu ) have been detected using the transit method .",
    "the search for new exoplanetary systems via transits has advanced to space - based missions with the launch of the european space agency s ( esa ) _ corot _  satellite @xcite and nasa s _ kepler _  mission @xcite .",
    "the objective of transit detection and follow - up is mainly to catalog and improve measurements of system parameters .",
    "studying the characteristics of extrasolar planetary systems is crucial for developing theories of planet formation that can adequately explain the origin and evolution of all planetary systems ( including our own ) .",
    "the target discussed in this paper , tres-3b is a hot - jupiter with one of the shortest orbital periods known ( p=1.3 days * ? ? ?",
    "* ) among the exoplanets .",
    "the planet orbits a g - type star ( t@xmath6 = 5720k ) , and has a mass and radius of @xmath71.92 @xmath8 and @xmath91.29 @xmath10 , respectively @xcite . due to its large impact parameter , tres-3b s transit has more of a v - shape than the typical u - shape . however , the transit is not grazing and the ability of various observers to consistently measure the transit parameters seem to indicate that the planet s disk completely enters the stellar disk during the transit @xcite . a blended eclipsing binary , which could account for the v - shape , has been ruled out from the radial velocity analysis @xcite",
    ". however , the v - shape of the transit makes measurements of transit properties challenging at shorter wavelengths , where stellar limb - darkening further degrades the trapezoidal u - shape of the transit .",
    "the level of insolation received on the dayside of tres-3b  due to its proximity to its host star should place it in the class of warm hot - jupiters with a temperature inversion in its atmosphere @xcite .",
    "however , secondary eclipse observations from the ground and space have shown that the evidence for an inversion layer is not strong @xcite .",
    "tres-3b s lack of an inversion layer is consistent with the idea that uv radiation from chromospherically active stars ( like tres-3b s parent star ) systematically destroys absorbers in the upper planetary atmosphere , thereby preventing the formation of an inversion layer @xcite .",
    "the ultra close - in orbit of tres-3b  also makes it a great target for follow - up transit monitoring .",
    "it has been suggested that planets with very short periods are likely to be falling into their host stars @xcite .",
    "some have looked for transit timing variations indicative of such orbital decay ( for e.g. ogle - tr-56b * ? ? ?",
    "tres-3b  is similar to ogle - tr-56b in many regards , including the orbital period ( @xmath11 days ) , size ( @xmath12 ) and impact parameter ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "though there has been no strong evidence for ttvs for ogle - tr-56b , it is one object that warrants long term study @xcite .",
    "transit monitoring of tres-3b  by other teams has so far confirmed its linear orbital ephemeris @xcite .",
    "a search for additional transiting companions using the epoxi mission has yielded no detections , since the likelihood of detecting a planetary sibling in a coplanar orbit with tres-3b  is lower for an outer planet given the inclination of the system @xcite ; inner planets are not expected since tres-3b  is already quite close to its parent star .    in this paper",
    "we report observations of eleven transits of tres-3b , taken as part of the apache point observatory survey of transit lightcurves of exoplanets ( apostle ) .",
    "the apostle  program is a follow - up transit monitoring program designed to obtain high - precision relative photometry on known transiting systems in order to refine measurements of system parameters and transit times ( see e.g. gj 1214b * ? ? ?",
    "in @xmath14  [ sec_obs ] we outline our observations , and in @xmath14  [ sec_pipeline ] we describe the data reduction .",
    "the two sections which follow , @xmath14  [ sec_mtq ] and @xmath14  [ sec_tmcmc ] , outline the transit model and the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyzer respectively . in @xmath14  [ sec_sysparams ]",
    "we present our estimates of the system parameters for tres-3b  and in the subsections @xmath14  [ sec_tdv ] and @xmath14  [ sec_ttv ] we present results from our study of transit depth variations ( tdvs ) and transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .",
    "finally , in @xmath14  [ sec_conclusions ] we summarize our findings .",
    "tres-3  was observed by apostle over a time span of 2 years between the summer of 2009 and the fall of 2011 .",
    "all observations of tres-3  were carried out using _ agile _ a high - speed frame - transfer photometer @xcite , on the arc 3.5 m telescope at apache point , new mexico .",
    "the _ agile _",
    "ccd has no dead time , as the charge is transferred to an adjoining array for read - out .",
    "all observations for tres-3  were made using _ agile _",
    "s medium - gain , slow read - out ( 100khz ) mode , with the charge read - out at 45sec intervals .",
    "the filter used for the observations was the @xmath15band similar to the sdss @xmath16 filter ( with central wavelength , @xmath17626 nm , * ? ? ?",
    "this observing filter is bluer than typical filters used for transit observations since _ agile _  is a blue sensitive ccd that is affected by a strong fringe pattern at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the summary of the 11 @xmath15band  observations is given in table [ table_obssum_tres3 ] .",
    "observations were made by adjusting the focus on the secondary mirror to smear the stellar point spread functions ( psfs ) across multiple pixels , which minimizes the systematics caused by pixel - to - pixel wandering of the psf .",
    "the long read - out ( exposure time ) also allowed for a greater count rate that maximized the signal - to - noise per image .",
    "the count rate was kept below agile s non - linearity limit of @xmath1852k adu and well below its saturation level of 61k adu by small adjustments to the telescope s secondary focus .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,>,^,^,^,^,>,>,^,^ \" , ]     for the case when planets are in mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) , @xcite show that the analytic expression , @xmath19 , can roughly estimate the amplitude of the timing deviation ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass of the unseen perturber , the mass of the transiting planet , the orbital period of the transiting planet and the order of the resonance respectively . for the tres-3  system , we can rule out possible system configurations given the variations seen in the o - c result from apostle s tap fit .",
    "the maximum possible ttv amplitude that could be hidden within the variations seen in apostle  transit times are @xmath25 . using the orbital period from table [ table_oc_tres3 ] and the mass of tres-3b , @xmath22 = 1.91 @xmath8 @xcite , we compute the maximum mass perturber that could exist in the tres-3  system in the 2:1 mmr to be @xmath26 , _ i.e. _  additional planets with @xmath27 m@xmath28may exist near the 2:1 mmr . at higher order resonances , this maximum mass ( for a possible perturber )",
    "is larger .",
    "* * photometric precision : * * apostle  monitored tres-3b  over a period of two years between 2009 and 2011 , gathering 11 @xmath15band  transit lightcurves .",
    "apostle  achieved photometric precision between 6001200ppm ( excluding nights with poor seeing ) . the summary of observational results is presented in table [ table_obssum_tres3 ] .     * * tres-3b  system parameters : * * from our analysis of 11 lightcurves of tres-3b , we were able to confirm previous estimates of system parameters for the tres-3  system .",
    "our estimates of derived system parameters in table [ table_partable01_tres3 ] show improvements ( @xmath18 1030% ) from previous measurements . due to the system s near grazing transit we note that several free parameters from ` mtq `  showed strong correlations in their joint - probabilities ( see figure [ figure_mcmc_fldc_tres3 ] ) .",
    "such correlations are not suited for rapid mcmc convergence , yet we were able to produce markov chains that converged and hence are able to derive statistically significant uncertainties for system parameters ; see results from the fldc chain in table [ table_partable01_tres3 ] .",
    "as previous attempts showed @xcite , the markov chains where limb - darkening coefficients were set as free parameters failed to converge , and so we report that apostle  did not achieve the photometric precision required to constrain limb - darkening coefficients for tres-3 .",
    "* * search for transit depth variations : * * variations in transit depth over epoch could be evidence for stellar variability .",
    "tres-3  is known to be variable @xcite , hence one might have expected strong variations in the transit depth with epoch .",
    "our uncalibrated flux ratios between the target and comparison show significant variability , yet we can not rule out variability in the comparison star as the cause .",
    "our multi - depth fits also show variations in the transit depth over transit epoch ( see figure [ figure_tdepthv_tres3 ] and table [ table_partable02_tres3 ] ) , however we refrain from making a confident assertion on the detection of stellar variability since , ( a ) the parameters from the multi - depth chain do not have statistically significant errors as the chain failed to converge , and ( b ) we can not rule out inaccuracies due to the incomplete sampling of several transits , and ( c ) the near - grazing nature of this transit makes constraining the depth of the transit trough more challenging .",
    "in fact removing several of the incompletely sampled transits lowers the overall scatter in transit depth measurements .     * * search for transit timing variations : * * the transit timing precisions achieved by apostle  easily allow for the detection of ttv signals @xmath29 1min ( see ttv uncertainties in table [ table_oc_tres3 ] ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the ability of the apostle  program to gather lightcurves with high photometric precision from the ground .",
    "however , we were unable to detect significant timing variations for tres-3b  in our data .",
    "we find that fitting for transit parameters while accounting for red - noise provided more conservative error estimates on transit times .",
    "transit times derived using ` tmcmc `  showed significant deviations from a linear ephemeris fit .",
    "the same data analyzed with analyzed with tap @xcite significantly reduced these deviations .",
    "the overall scatter in the o - c values from our rednoise analysis was on the order of @xmath30 sec , which rules out planetary companions more massive than 0.66 m@xmath28near the 2:1 mmr , and larger companions near higher order resonances .",
    "transit times published in the literature are derived using different techniques for fitting transit parameters .",
    "a proper analysis of transit times would need a simultaneous analysis of transit lightcurves using a transit model that is ( 1 ) suited for bayesian inference ( _ i.e. _  with a fairly uncorrelated parameter set , * ? ? ? * ) and ( 2 ) a transit model that can adequately account for red - noise in the data ( like tap , * ? ? ?",
    "the catalog of transit times accumulated in the literature and used in this study of tres-3b  are not derived from such an analysis .",
    "mcmc analysis can also be inefficiently slow given large parameter sets and complex internal checks on a given model .",
    "fast mcmc routines like the mcmc hammer @xcite may in the future , allow for rapid analysis using complex models .",
    "_ we provide the entire set of apostle  lightcurves of tres-3b  with this publication to allow future projects to apply improved methods to study this system .",
    "_    extrapolations from _ kepler _  planetary candidate data seem to indicate that small planets may be ubiquitous @xcite .",
    "interesting trends that have been noted are , ( 1 ) hot - jupiters tend be alone , _",
    "i.e. _  lacking other transiting planet siblings @xcite and ( 2 ) members of multi - planet systems with short period planets ( period @xmath31 10 days ) are more likely to be hot - neptunes @xcite .",
    "this trend seems to reveal the existence of different formation pathways among volatile - rich planets .",
    "hence the lack of detections ttvs in tres-3b  ( a hot - jupiter ) is consistent with _ kepler",
    "_ s findings .",
