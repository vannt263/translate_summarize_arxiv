    "the influence of high porosity aerogel as quenched disorder has been studied in various systems such as liquid @xmath6he,@xcite @xmath0he-@xmath6he mixture,@xcite @xmath0he,@xcite and liquid crystals.@xcite the effect of aerogel on superfluid @xmath0he is exceptionally interesting because it is a _",
    "p - wave triplet _ anisotropic superfluid possessing continuous symmetry .",
    "since the discovery of superfluiditiy of @xmath0he in high porosity aerogel,@xcite more than a decade of theoretical and experimental efforts have been invested to understand this system and have revealed many interesting phenomena .",
    "the fragile nature of _ p - wave _ pairing against impurity - scattering was immediately recognized by the significant depression of superfluid transition , @xcite and the theoretical descriptions based on various isotropic impurity - scattering models have provided a successful account for the observed behavior .",
    "@xcite a wide variety of experimental evidence reflecting the role of aerogel as an effective pair - breaking agent are now well documented.@xcite    for the past few years , attention has been shifted to understand phenomena related to an energy scale smaller than the condensation energy . for example , the relative stability among possible superfluid phases , specifically the transition between two superfluid phases observed in this system , the @xmath1-like and the @xmath5-like phases , has been investigated . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", the supercooled @xmath1-like phase appears at all pressures studied , even below the bulk polycritical point ( pcp),@xcite while only a very narrow region where the two phases coexist was identified on warming.@xcite in the presence of low magnetic fields , the @xmath5-like to @xmath1-like transition was observed , on warming , to follow a quadratic field dependence,@xcite which is reminiscent of the bulk @xmath2 transition , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the @xmath2 transition and the superfluid transition temperatures , respectively , and @xmath10 is a strong - coupling parameter that is a function of @xmath11 parameters of the ginzburg - landau free energy ( see sec .",
    "however , the systematic field and pressure dependence study by gervais _ et al._@xcite found a monotonic increase in @xmath10 with pressure without showing any anomalies .",
    "this observation raised a question on the position or the existence of the pcp in aerogel .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the @xmath1 and the @xmath5 phases of bulk @xmath0he are highly competing phases separated by first - order transition with a minute - free - energy difference and have identical intrinsic superfluid transition temperatures .",
    "these properties are at the heart of many intriguing phenomena showing subtle modifications of the @xmath2 transition in the presence of weak external perturbations such as a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the presence of impurities or disorder will have a similar influence on the @xmath2 transition .    in 1996 , volovik@xcite discussed the significance of the quenched random anisotropic disorder presented by the strand - like aerogel structure and its interaction with the anisotropic order parameter .",
    "this coupling is thought to be particularly important in the @xmath1-phase , where the order parameter is doubly anisotropic in the sense that the rotational symmetries in spin and orbital space are broken separately .",
    "et al._@xcite argued that the aerogel strands generated orbital fields emulating the role of a magnetic field , thereby giving rise to similar profound effects on the @xmath1-like to @xmath5-like transition .",
    "they further suggested the use of uniaxially deformed aerogel to amplify and to systematically investigate the effect of the anisotropic disorder.@xcite a series of calculations by aoyama and ikeda@xcite are consonant with these ideas and predict a widened @xmath1-like phase region in a uniaxially deformed aerogel , the appearance of a novel superfluid phase in uniaxially stretched aerogel , and a change in the pcp location in the phase diagram .    unlike the @xmath5-like phase , the clear identification of the @xmath1-like phase in aerogel has not been made .",
    "however , some of the recent nmr measurements using uniaxially deformed aerogels@xcite provide compelling evidence that the @xmath1-like phase possesses the @xmath12 pairing symmetry , albeit with unusual textural configurations . the free - energy calculation by ikeda and aoyama@xcite also found the disordered @xmath12 phase as the most stable among the various plausible pairing states , such as the imry - ma,@xcite the planar , and the robust@xcite phases .",
    "furthermore , the third superfluid phase observed in 98% aerogel in the presence of high magnetic fields@xcite fortifies this identification .",
    "therefore , we will continue our discussion with the assumption that the @xmath1-like phase observed at least in 98% aerogel has the same pairing symmetry as the bulk @xmath1-phase .    with this notion",
    ", we conducted longitudinal ultrasound attenuation measurements in the superfluid phases of @xmath0he in 98% porosity silica aerogel .",
    "our measurements were performed in the presence of magnetic fields , 0 to 0.444  t , and at various sample pressures ranging from 14 to 33  bar . at the highest field ,",
    "the existence of the meta - stable @xmath1-like phase persisted to the lowest temperatures , thereby allowing the sound attenuation in the @xmath1-like phase to be measured over the entire range of the temperatures studied . in lower magnetic fields , we were able to identify the transitions between the two phases on cooling and warming , and herein , a @xmath3-@xmath5-@xmath4 phase diagram of this system is presented .",
    "the presence of the compliant aerogel complicates the sound propagation because the sound modes of the liquid @xmath0he and the aerogel matrix are effectively coupled.@xcite as a result , two longitudinal sound modes emerge in this composite medium : one with the speed of sound close to , but slightly lower than , that of the liquid ( fast mode ) and the other with a significantly lower speed of sound ( slow mode).@xcite we measured the longitudinal fast sound attenuation in superfluid @xmath0he in 98% aerogel at frequencies between 3.69 and 11.3  mhz .",
    "the employment of the multiple frequency excitations turned out to be extremely valuable in this work for the reason described later in this paper .",
    "two best - matched linbo@xmath13 transducers ( 9.6  mm diameter ) with fundamental resonances of 1.1  mhz were selected from six transducers tested using a broadband spectrum analyzer and were used as a transmitter and a receiver .",
    "the transducers were supported by a macor spacer forming a 3.02  mm size acoustic cavity .",
    "aerogel with 98% porosity was grown in and around this cavity to ensure optimal acoustic coupling between the aerogel and the transducers .",
    "the aerogel grown outside of the cavity was carefully removed , and copper wires were attached to the outer surfaces ( electrodes ) of the transducers using silver epoxy . in order to reduce the ringing of the transducers , a thin layer of silver epoxy was applied to the electrode . a small piece of a cigarette paper with numerous needle holes was placed between each transducer and the cell wall to interrupt back reflections from the wall through the bulk liquid .",
    "the sample cell housing the cavity was placed inside a homemade superconducting solenoid magnet located in the inner vacuum space .",
    "the magnet was thermally anchored to the mixing chamber .",
    "we chose the magnetic field , @xmath14 , to be perpendicular to the sound wave vector @xmath15 , @xmath16 , expecting @xmath17 in the @xmath1-like phase , where @xmath18 indicates the orbital angular momentum of the cooper pair . the top part of the sample cell forms a diaphragm so the pressure of the cell can be measured capacitively .",
    "the variation in the cell pressure during the measurement was around @xmath19  bar .",
    "a schematic of the experimental geometry can be found elsewhere.@xcite    a commercial spectrometer , libra / nmrkit ii ( tecmag inc . , houston , tx ) was used to transmit 3 @xmath20s pulses and also to detect the transmitted signals .",
    "each measurement was obtained by averaging eight transmitter signals produced in a phase alternating pulse sequence .",
    "the level of excitation used in this experiment was set in the range where neither self - heating nor nonlinearity was observed .",
    "in one temperature sweep , the measurements at four pre - determined frequencies were performed in a cyclic manner .",
    "the temperature was monitored by a melting curve thermometer for @xmath21  mk and a pt - nmr thermometer for @xmath22  mk .    in spite of our effort to spoil the quality factor of the transducers ,",
    "sustained ringings were observed and we were unable to resolve echoes following the initial received signal .",
    "consequently , by integrating a portion of the received signal , only the relative attenuation could be determined .",
    "the region of integration was carefully chosen not to include any echoes .",
    "our method produced consistent relative attenuation for various choices of the integration range within the safe window described above .",
    "the relative attenuation in reference to the value at the aerogel superfluid transition temperature ( @xmath23 ) was determined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sound path length and @xmath26 is the integrated area of the transmitter signal at temperature @xmath4 .",

    "it is expected that the attenuation in the @xmath1-like phase is higher than in the @xmath5-like phase under the assumption that it is the @xmath12 state , since the sound presumably propagates along the node direction in our experimental configuration . however , unlike in the bulk , the difference in attenuation between the @xmath1-like and the @xmath5-like phases is much smaller and subtle because of the absence of the order - parameter collective modes , which are the fingerprints of specific pairing symmetry , and the presence of the impurity states residing in the gap .",

    "the attenuation in the @xmath1-like phase is slightly larger than in the @xmath5-like phase , while the largest difference is observed in the zero temperature limit .",
    "for this reason , the acoustic signature of the @xmath2 transition in aerogel is not as clear as in the bulk . despite this small difference in attenuation , the @xmath5-like to @xmath1-like transition features are noticeable in most of the cases ( indicated by the arrows in figs.1 and 2 ) .",

    "the presence of a magnetic field introduces an additional term in the g - l expansion given by @xmath76 here , @xmath77 represents the order parameter of a superfluid state with spin ( @xmath20 ) and orbital ( @xmath78 ) indices.@xcite the magnetic field couples through the spin channel of the order parameter . with two distinct symmetries in the @xmath1 and @xmath5 phase order parameters ,",
    "this quadratic contribution lifts the degeneracy in the superfluid transition temperature , thereby pushing the @xmath1-phase @xmath9 slightly above that of the @xmath5 phase . as a result",
    ", a narrow region of the @xmath1-phase must be wedged between the normal and the @xmath5 phase for @xmath68 , even for an infinitesimally small magnetic field .",
    "the degree of this effect is inversely related to the free - energy difference between two phases , @xmath79 , giving rise to the diverging behavior in @xmath10 as @xmath80 .    in the presence of aerogel ,",
    "the impurity - scattering warrants various corrections to both @xmath81 and @xmath11 parameters .",
    "the first - order corrections obviously come from the suppression of @xmath82 by pair - breaking and incur the reduction in the strong - coupling effects in the @xmath11-parameters simply scaled by @xmath49 .",
    "the most extensive calculation of the @xmath11-parameters including various vertex corrections was done by aoyama and ikeda.@xcite their theoretical phase diagram based on those corrections indeed resembles the bulk phase diagram that is , in effect , shifted to lower temperature and , simultaneously , to higher pressure , resulting in the relocation of the pcp to a higher pressure .",
    "aoyama and ikeda have also incorporated the anisotropic nature of the aerogel through the angular dependence of the scattering amplitude.@xcite in a uniaxially deformed aerogel , the calculation shows the unambiguous effect of global anisotropy as uniform orbital field , represented by an additional quadratic free - energy term,@xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the aerogel strand .",
    "the similarity between eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) is apparent .",
    "the effect of the orbital field produced by the aerogel strands was estimated to be comparable to the effect produced by a magnetic field @xmath85  0.1  t in the case of complete alignment.@xcite it has been experimentally demonstrated that uniaxial compression indeed induces optical birefringence proportional to the strain and , consequently , global anisotropy into the system.@xcite    in a globally isotropic aerogel , however , the local anisotropy comes into play only when @xmath86 , where @xmath87 represents the correlation length of the aerogel and @xmath88 is the pair correlation length.@xcite in the other limit , the local anisotropy is simply averaged out to produce no effect . as discussed by vicente _",
    "_ , this net local anisotropy should emulate the effect of magnetic field even in the absence of magnetic field in a globally isotropic aerogel .",
    "furthermore , an inhomogeneity in the local anisotropy would cause a broadening of the @xmath2 transition in aerogel in which the mixture of the @xmath1 and @xmath5 phases coexists.@xcite considering @xmath89  40  -  50  nm in 98% aerogel , this local anisotropy effect in a globally isotropic aerogel should be more pronounced at higher pressures but is expected to tail off as the pressure decreases to the point where @xmath90 , which occurs around 10  bar .",
    "the impressive agreement in @xmath23 between the experiments and the theory of sauls and sharma@xcite was achieved by incorporating the aerogel correlation length into the depairing parameter of the homogeneous isotropic scattering model.@xcite    although the aerogel sample used in this work is supposed to be isotropic , we can not rule out the possibility of having a weak global anisotropy built into this sample from the sample preparation or the shrinkage occurring during condensation of @xmath0he . in either case , the observed behavior in this work as well as others can be explained coherently.@xcite",
    "longitudinal ultrasound attenuation measurements were conducted in a 98% uncompressed aerogel in the presence of magnetic fields . utilizing the metastable @xmath1-like phase that extended down to the lowest temperature in 0.444  t",
    ", we were able to establish the temperature dependence of the attenuation in the @xmath1-like phase over the entire superfluid region .",
    "this arrangement allowed us to determine the @xmath2 transitions in aerogel in various magnetic fields .",
    "based on the transition points on warming , a @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram of this system is constructed .",
    "the key features of the phase diagram can be understood on the basis of two fundamental points : first , the strong - coupling effect is significantly reduced in this system by impurity - scattering , and second , the anisotropic disorder presented in the form of aerogel strands plays an important role that emulates the effect of a magnetic field .",
