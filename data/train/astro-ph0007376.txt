    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are usually classified into three categories , based on their radio morphology : plerions , shell  like and `` composite '' .",
    "about one tenth of known snrs belongs to this last category ( green 1998 ) .",
    "they are characterized by a radio / x  ray shell , related to the expanding ejecta , plus a central synchrotron nebula , powered by the loss of rotational energy from a neutron star ( weiler & sramek 1988 ) .",
    "the radio source  was classified as an snr by kesteven ( 1968 ) .",
    "subsequent radio observations with the vla and the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope showed that g0.9 + 0.1 can be classified as a composite snr .",
    "in fact , it consists of a radio polarized core component ( @xmath02@xmath3 diameter ) , surrounded by a shell ( @xmath08@xmath3 diameter ) with a steeper radio spectrum ( helfand & becker 1987 , hereafter hb87 ; gray 1994 ) .",
    "la rosa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) recently confirmed the composite morphology of the radio emission with vla observations at 20 and 90 cm .",
    "they measured spectral indices @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 for the shell and @xmath9@xmath10@xmath12 for the core , typical of composite snrs .",
    "the position of  is very close to the galactic center ( gc ) direction , and a distance estimate based on the @xmath13-d relation places it at @xmath010 kpc ( downes 1971 ) .",
    "owing to the high interstellar absorption ( @xmath7  ) , this snr was not previously observed in soft x ",
    "rays , with the possible exception of a marginal detection with the @xmath14 observatory ( helfand & becker 1987 ) . during the bepposax survey of the gc region ( sidoli et al .",
    "1999 ) , we obtained the first clear x  ray detection of   ( mereghetti et al .",

    "the observations were obtained with the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs , boella et al .",
    "1997 ) that covers the 1.810 kev energy range .",
    "this is an imaging detector that provides good spatial and energy resolution ( @xmath08.5% full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at 6 kev ) over a circular field of view with a diameter of @xmath15 .",
    "the location of g0.9 + 0.1 was observed on 1999 august 2527 for a net exposure time of 78.6 ks in each of the 2 available mecs units .",
    "the images in the soft ( 25 kev ) and hard ( 5 - 10 kev ) energy ranges are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mecs ] .",
    "the central strong source , located at r.a.@xmath16 , dec.@xmath17 ( j2000 , 1@xmath3 uncertainty ) , is coincident with the radio core of g0.9 + 0.1 . due to the proximity of the gc , significant diffuse",
    "x  ray emission is present in the whole field of view ( see e.g. , koyama et al . 1996 ; sidoli & mereghetti 1999 ) .",
    "this emission is particularly strong in the southern part of the image , where the sgr  b2 molecular cloud is located ( murakami et al .",
    "1999 ; sidoli 2000 ) .",
    "observations of the  field carried out with the bepposax high energy non  imaging instrument ( pds , 15200 kev ) are not useful in this context , because of the severe crowding of contaminating hard x  ray sources in the gc region .",
    "the location of  is contaminated both by the gc thermal diffuse emission ( kt@xmath18  kev ) , and by x ",

    "the local background was estimated from the southern half of an annular region centered on   with inner and outer radii of 5@xmath3 and @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting mecs net count rate is 0.0247@xmath200.0007 s@xmath5 .",
    "we rebinned the mecs counts in order to have at least 20 net counts in each energy bin , and to sample the instrumental energy resolution with no more than 3 spectral channels .",
    "we tried to fit the spectrum with different models : power  law , thermal bremsstrahlung , black body , thermal hot plasma ( mekal in xspec ) .",
    "the results are reported in table  [ tab : spe ] .",
    "the best fit model is a power  law with photon index @xmath21 , absorption , @xmath22 , of @xmath23  , and flux f@xmath24 erg @xmath25 s@xmath5 ( 210 kev , corrected for interstellar absorption ) .",
    "a thermal bremstrahlung gives an equally good fit , but the resulting high temperature ( too high for a snr ) means that it mimics a power  law in the energy range of our observations .    as shown in fig .",

    "no flux variations were seen during the bepposax observation .",
    "we searched for coherent pulsations over a wide range of periods ( 4ms  @xmath04@xmath110@xmath2s ) , both in the total energy range and for the soft ( 25 kev ) and hard ( 510 kev ) bands separately , without finding any significant signal . in table2 the 3@xmath46 upper limits to the pulsed fraction , derived for the assumption of a sinusoidal modulation , are listed for selected periods .    .",

    "we used as a comparison a 25 ks observation of cyg x1 obtained in 1998 october .",
    "we selected only time intervals in which the bepposax attitude was determined with two star trackers ( in fact small deviations may be present when no star tracker is active or when only one is in use ) .",

    "there is evidence that the profile of  is slightly broader than that expected for a single point ",
    "like source .",
    "this might be due to the contribution of a central extended synchrotron nebula , although we can not exclude that the difference in the two radial profiles is due to the presence of an underlying diffuse emission , not properly subtracted by our background estimate .      to estimate an upper limit to the x  ray emission from the radio shell of  ( located 4@xmath3 from the radio core ) we considered the counts from an annular region from 3@xmath3 to 5@xmath3 from the centroid of the emission . fitting the resulting spectrum with an absorbed mekal model ( n@xmath47 fixed at 10@xmath48  @xmath25 ) we derived a 210 kev flux f@xmath49@xmath50  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath25 ( corrected for interstellar absorption ) , that translates into a luminosity of @xmath51  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "of course , this represent an upper limit to the shell luminosity , since some of the counts could be due to sgr  b2 .",

    " ray data ( extrapolated to the 0.54.5 kev range ) and the radio observations ( hb87 ; l@xmath54=7@xmath55  erg  s@xmath5 ) , we find the following ratios : l@xmath56/l@xmath57@xmath581.2 , l@xmath56/l@xmath59=@xmath60 , where `` c '' and `` s '' indicate the core and shell components",

    "[ fig : oldnew ] the spectral parameters of the central component are consistent with those reported earlier ( mereghetti et al .",
    "1998 ) and there is no evidence for flux variations between 1999 august and 1997 april .",

    "it is also likely that part of the emission is due to the pulsar itself .",

    "the location of the composite snr  in the gc invites a comparison with other snrs located in this same region .",
    "the green catalogue ( green 1998 ) lists seven snrs in the direction of the gc ( @xmath87@xmath88 ) , six shell  like and only one composite ( ) .",
    "besides , only two of them have been reported to clearly emit x  rays : g359.10.5 , from its central region surrounded by the radio shell , and g359.00.9 , from a part of its radio shell ( bamba et al .",
    "2000 ; asca ) .",
    "while g359.10.5 seems to be located at the gc distance , g359.00.9 is probably a foreground object .",
    "another possible snr , the sgra  east halo ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) , has been recently reported to emit thermal x ",
    "rays with kt@xmath00.6 kev ( sidoli & mereghetti 1999 ) . the sgra east halo is a radio source with a diameter of @xmath020 pc located near the center of our galaxy .",
    "it is a distinct object from the nearby sgra  east ( pedlar et al .",
    "1989 ) and is not included in the green catalogue .",
    "the lack of x  ray detections from the other snrs in the gc region could be due to several reasons : their shells may not emit x  rays , due to an evolved age of the remnants ( in the case of thermal emission ) or , as suggested by bamba et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , because of a reduced lifetime of the electrons emitting synchrotron x ",
    "rays caused by a higher magnetic field in the gc region ( in the case of non  thermal emission from the shell ) . in addition , if their shells emit soft x  rays , their observability is hampered by the severe interstellar absorption ( especially below 2 kev ) and by the presence of contaminating x  ray sources , both point  like and diffuse .",
    "it is thus not surprising that definite detections have been obtained when the emission is hard ( as in the case of the plerion ) , or particularly bright ( as in the case of the sgra  east halo ) .",
    "snrs are thought to contribute to the diffuse x  ray emission observed from the gc , especially at soft x  rays .",
    "however , the number of snrs known to emit high energy radiation is too low to account for this emission ( e.g. koyama et al . 1996 ) , even if the reason for this discrepancy could only be an observational bias .",
    "the new bepposax data reported here , the first x  ray observation pointed at the center of the composite snr , have confirmed the non  thermal origin of the x  ray emission that was suggested by the previous serendipitous observation ( mereghetti et al .",
    "1998 ; sidoli et al .",
    "such data could not completely rule out a thermal origin of the x  ray emission , due to the poor statistic of the off  axis spectrum .",
    "this follow - up observation has allowed us to significantly better constrain the spectral parameters and to safely conclude that the x ",
    "rays observed from  are due to non  thermal emission from its radio core .    a thermal model , either originating from the surface of a neutron star , or from a hot diffuse plasma filling the central part of the snr , can now be excluded as the main contributor to the observed x  rays . a double component model , non  thermal plus thermal ( blackbody or mekal ) emission components , is not required by the bepposax data .",
    "there are some indications of a diffuse nature of the x  ray emission from .",
    "however , since a strong contamination from the local background exists , xmm  newton and @xmath89 observations , with their superior sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution , are needed to confirm this finding and to discriminate between a point source ( i.e. a neutron star ) and a synchrotron nebula and to possibly detect x ",
