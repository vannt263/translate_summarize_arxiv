    "the space of khler metrics on a khler manifold ( or orbifold ) can be described in two equivalent ways , reflecting the fact that a khler manifold is both a complex and a symplectic manifold .    from the complex point of view , one starts with a fixed complex manifold @xmath0 and khler class @xmath1 , and considers the space @xmath2 of all symplectic forms @xmath3 on @xmath4 that are compatible with @xmath5 and represent the class @xmath6 .",

    "moreover , since each @xmath491 is a third degree polynomial , it is clear from  ( [ scalarsymp2 ] ) that the scalar curvature @xmath119 is a first degree polynomial . by  ( [ extremalsymp ] )",

    ", one can easily check that the extremal metric @xmath502 , defined on @xmath513 , extends to a well defined smooth extremal metric on @xmath514 whose potential is exactly given by @xmath515 .",
    "note that the hyperplane in @xmath89 that contains @xmath512 has an induced affine structure , and so it makes sense to consider @xmath516 .",
    "because of the equivariant version of darboux s theorem , we can understand what happens in the normal directions to each point @xmath517 by analysing a neighborhood of zero in @xmath518 . in @xmath519-polar",

    "hence we have an extension of each extremal khler metric @xmath532 , from @xmath513 to @xmath533 , having normal conical singularities around each @xmath534 . the same argument can be used to show that the metric on each @xmath534 extends to the moment map pre - images of the relative interior of each facet of @xmath512 ( an @xmath535-dimensional simplex and face of @xmath510 ) .",
    "one can continue this process until the metric is extended to the whole @xmath496 .",
    "for example , at the last step one extends the metric to the fixed points of the @xmath41-action , corresponding to the vertices of @xmath510 .",
    "there the metric looks like the product of @xmath32 cones of dimension two and angles @xmath536 , where @xmath537 are the positive real labels of the @xmath32 facets of @xmath510 that meet at the relevant vertex .",
    "recall from the introduction that the extremal khler metrics given by theorem  [ thm4 ] are actually bochner - khler ( see  @xcite ) . in dimension four ( @xmath121 )",
    "`` bochner - khler '' is the same as `` self - dual khler '' .",
    "it follows from the work of derdzinski  @xcite and apostolov - gauduchon  @xcite that , whenever its scalar curvature @xmath119 is nonzero , a self - dual khler metric is conformally einstein , with conformal factor given by @xmath120 . in this section",
    "we explore this relation for a particular one - parameter family of metrics arising from theorem  [ thm4 ] .",
    "consider the smooth symplectic toric manifold @xmath538 associated to the simplex @xmath539 .",
    "for any @xmath540 , let @xmath541 be the extremal khler metric defined by the potential @xmath542 where @xmath543 and @xmath544 . here and in the rest of this section @xmath545 .",
    "note that in  ( [ eq : potgm ] ) the two terms with @xmath546 and @xmath547 correspond to the standard flat metric on @xmath126 , while the terms with @xmath548 and @xmath465 only depend on the `` radial '' coordinate @xmath549 .",
    "this means that the metric @xmath541 defined by the potential @xmath550 is @xmath123-invariant ( see  @xcite for a general discussion of this type of metrics ) .",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath551 of @xmath541 is given by @xmath552 which is strictly positive on @xmath553 if @xmath554 .",
    "hence , for any @xmath555 , the metric @xmath556 is a self - dual einstein metric on @xmath557 with a normal conical singularity of angle @xmath531 around a @xmath558 .    in this simple case",
    "it is not hard to check explicitly that @xmath559 is einstein and compute its scalar curvature .",
    "a result of derdzinski  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) states that for any @xmath560-dimensional extremal khler metric @xmath561 with non constant scalar curvature @xmath119 , the metric @xmath562 is einstein if and only if @xmath563 moreover , a standard formula for the scalar curvatures of conformally related metrics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) states that the scalar curvature @xmath564 of @xmath565 is given by @xmath566 in both these formulas @xmath567 is the laplacian with respect to the metric @xmath561 .    for any toric khler metric defined by a potential @xmath568 , the laplacian @xmath567 of a function @xmath569 ( i.e. a smooth @xmath41-invariant function on @xmath40 )",
    "is given by @xmath570 where @xmath571 and @xmath491 are the entries of @xmath404 .",
    "this formula , together with the simple form of @xmath550 and @xmath551 , makes the calculations involved in  ( [ eq : extein ] ) and  ( [ eq : confsc ] ) easy enough .",
    "for example , one computes that the scalar curvature @xmath572 of @xmath559 is given by @xmath573 one sees that the self - dual einstein metric @xmath559 has positive scalar curvature when @xmath574 , but is actually ricci - flat when @xmath125 or @xmath127 provided we can make sense of it .    when @xmath125 the extremal scalar curvature @xmath575 is given by @xmath576 and hence vanishes at the unique point of @xmath577 corresponding to the vertex @xmath578 .",
    "the complement of this point in @xmath579 is just the normal bundle of the `` opposite '' @xmath580 ( corresponding to the facet @xmath581 ) , i.e. a line bundle with first chern class @xmath582 .",
    "the label @xmath125 means that the normal conical singularity can be resolved by passing to a @xmath583-quotient , i.e. to the line bundle with @xmath584 given by @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the self - dual ricci - flat einstein metric @xmath585 is smooth and complete when considered on @xmath124 .",
    "being @xmath123-invariant , it must coincide with the well - known eguchi - hanson metric  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath586 the matrix @xmath587 converges to the matrix @xmath588 one easily checks that @xmath589 where @xmath590 the metric @xmath591 defined by this potential does not extend to the whole @xmath577 .",
    "however it is a well - defined smooth complete extremal khler metric of finite volume on @xmath592 , where the sphere @xmath593 corresponds to the facet @xmath581 . in the normal directions to this sphere at infinity , the extremal metric @xmath591 looks like a complete hyperbolic cusp ( this can be seen by considering for example @xmath594 and @xmath595 for the orbifold metrics on @xmath448 discussed in   [ ssec : ext - s2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath596 is symplectomorphic to an open ball in @xmath126 and , with respect to the complex structure @xmath597 defined by @xmath598 , biholomorphic to @xmath599 .",
    "the scalar curvature of @xmath591 is given by @xmath600 which vanishes exactly at the sphere at infinity .",
    "hence , the metric @xmath601 is a smooth complete self - dual ricci - flat einstein metric on @xmath596 , obviously with infinite volume .",
    "being @xmath123-invariant and @xmath596 being diffeomorphic to @xmath126 , it must coincide with the well - known taub - nut metric  @xcite .    as promised in the introduction , we get in this way a one parameter family of @xmath123-invariant self - dual einstein metrics @xmath602 , @xmath603 , having positive scalar curvature when @xmath555 and connecting the ricci - flat eguchi - hanson metric on @xmath124 @xmath604 with the ricci - flat taub - nut metric on @xmath605 @xmath606 .",
    "note that one of the metrics in between is the khler - einstein fubini - study metric on @xmath579 @xmath607 .    in  @xcite galicki and lawson use quaternionic reduction to produce self - dual einstein metrics on certain weighted projective spaces .",
    "these include @xmath608 , which up to covering / quotient correspond in the above family to @xmath609 .",
    "galicki - lawson assume that @xmath610 , @xmath611 and @xmath612 .",
    "they point out that when @xmath613 their metrics converge to fubini - study on @xmath579 , while when @xmath614 they converge to eguchi - hanson on @xmath124 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath251 and @xmath125 cases in our family .",
