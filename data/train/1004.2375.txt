    "we take the opportunity here to emphasize the structure coefficients of a generalised orbit algebra .",
    "recall that there is a partition of @xmath1 associated with any generalised orbit algebra by theorem [ partition ] , that is both a basis of the generalised orbit algebra , and the list of sets on which the polynomials in the generalised orbit algebra take constant values .",

    "one can show that the relations stated in this result are exactly the same as the ones obtained in equation ( [ mnukhin ] ) , that is to say , a coefficient matrix satisfying one set of relations satisfies the other set .",

    "we deduce that  :    [ lovasz ] for every group @xmath11 of permutations of @xmath0 , if @xmath2 and @xmath174 are two subsets of @xmath0 and there is a bijection @xmath286 from @xmath2 to @xmath174 such that for every @xmath309 in @xmath2 , @xmath310 and @xmath311 are @xmath11-isomorphic , and if the size of @xmath2 is bigger than @xmath117 , then @xmath2 and @xmath174 are @xmath11-isomorphic .",
    "this result also applies to generalised orbit algebras , if one replaces the notion of isomorphism by membership in the same generalised orbit .",
    "this theorem is in some sense best possible in the general framework of orbit algebras , and consequently , also for generalised orbit algebras .",
    "indeed , there exists orbit algebras of order @xmath321 with non reconstructible sets of size @xmath20 . as an example , consider the orbit algebra of the permutation group @xmath11 generated by  : @xmath322    consider the set @xmath323 , and let @xmath324 , @xmath325 .",
    "we now have two sets @xmath2 and @xmath174 of size @xmath20 not in the same orbit of @xmath11 , because every element of @xmath11 leaves invariant the parity of the number of even elements of sets containing exactly one element in each pair @xmath326 .",
    "however , if one considers a subsetof size @xmath327 in @xmath2 , then one can see that there exists exactly one pair @xmath328 with no element in @xmath2 , and applying @xmath329 we find a subsetof size @xmath327 in @xmath174 .",
    "this defines a one to one mapping from the subsets of size @xmath327 in @xmath2 to the subsets of size @xmath327 in @xmath174 , showing that @xmath174 is a @xmath11-reconstruction of @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore natural to try to find properties of the group that would allow us to lower the bound of @xmath117 .",
    "considering the order of the group yields a theorem of v.mller that also applies in any generalised orbit algebra ( even if there is no group to consider ) .",
    "we prove a slightly different result in the more general context of generalised orbit algebras  :    [ mull ] if @xmath49 is a generalised orbit algebra of order @xmath112 with generalised orbits @xmath4 , and @xmath2 and @xmath174 are two subsets of @xmath0 with cardinality @xmath111 , such that for every generalised orbit @xmath5 of size less than @xmath111 , @xmath331 , then for every generalised orbit @xmath7 : @xmath332            [ muller ] if @xmath49 is a generalised orbit algebra of order @xmath112 with generalised orbits @xmath4 , and @xmath2 and @xmath174 are two subsets of @xmath0 with cardinality @xmath341 , such that for every generalised orbit @xmath5 of size less than @xmath111 , @xmath331 , then @xmath2 and @xmath174 belong to the same generalised orbit of @xmath49 .    in the case of the orbit algebra of the group @xmath11 , this implies that sets of size greater than @xmath342 are @xmath11-reconstructible ( see @xcite ) . in the above example",
    ", the group @xmath11 is commutative , and of order @xmath343 , so @xmath344 : this example also shows that mller s theorem is best possible . by adding an appropriate number of ( fixed ) elements",
    ", one can construct a subgroup of @xmath48 of order @xmath343 with non - reconstructible subsets of size @xmath20 , if @xmath345 .",
    "thus , all the limit cases of mller s theorem are covered , because if @xmath346 , we know by lovsz s theorem that sets of size @xmath20 are reconstructible .",
    "this example shows that one can not use the polynomial relations between the coefficients of generalised orbit algebras to improve theorems [ lovasz ] and [ muller ] without introducing another generalised orbit algebra parameter than the maximum size of a generalised orbit .              to construct generalised orbit algebras",
    "not arising from a group of permutations , we go back to theorem @xcite , and remark that according to the proof , any two sets @xmath2 and @xmath174 such that for every orbit distinct from @xmath2 and @xmath174 @xmath353 have size equal to @xmath20 only if either :          in these conditions , we remark that unifying the generalised orbits @xmath2 and @xmath174 yields a generalised orbit algebra .",
    "sometimes , the resulting generalised orbit algebra may not be an orbit algebra , that is to say , for the first orbit algebra , there s not always an outer permutation stabilizing every orbit except a and b , but mixing elements of a and b.    for example , if @xmath354 and @xmath11 is the group generated by the permutations @xmath355 we take @xmath356 and @xmath357 .",
    "@xmath2 can be written as the union of two sets in the same orbit @xmath358 : @xmath359 and @xmath360 , with intersection @xmath361 , whereas @xmath174 can be written only in one way as the union of two sets of @xmath358 : @xmath362 and @xmath363 , but the intersection @xmath364 is not in the same orbit as @xmath361 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the fact that there can be a permutation mapping @xmath365 to @xmath366 respecting the orbits of @xmath359,,@xmath361 , and @xmath364 .",
