    "in many astrophysical applications photometric measurements through the standard @xmath7 filters are used to analyze radiation in the continuum from stellar objects .",
    "for example , a diagnostic by the ( @xmath8)-diagram is frequently applied to compare the observed colour indices to those of the continuum radiation . however ,",
    "photometric magnitudes represent integrated fluxes that include both the continuum and the line spectrum .",
    "therefore , a correction for lines has to be applied to obtain photometric flux - points of the true continuum .",
    "the effect on the @xmath9 magnitudes of the removal of absorption lines from the spectrum was already introduced by @xcite .",
    "they found that the absorption lines cause _ fainter _ magnitudes at all wavelengths . on the other hand the presence of emission lines in the spectral region of the photometric passbands leads to _ brighter _ magnitudes than those of the continuum .",
    "however , it is difficult to quantify this effect . a strong variation of the emission spectrum ( e.g. due to outbursts and/or orbital motion ) ,",
    "large differences between individual objects and the complex profile of the true continuum of some interacting binaries ( e.g. symbiotic stars , classical novae ) preclude a simple solution .",
    "therefore this problem has been approached only individually and without giving a concept for a general application .",
    "probably a first more thorough approach was described by @xcite who corrected their @xmath5 magnitudes for strong emission lines in the spectrum of arpav .",
    "other authors briefly reported just their results on the emission lines effect to evaluate the continuum level in the optical region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently @xcite suggested an accurate calculation of @xmath2 corrections for the @xmath10 passbands .",
    "in this paper we aim to quantify the effect of emission lines on the @xmath11 magnitudes by the exact approach and to derive an approximate formula for an operative use . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce our method , in sect .  3",
    "demonstrate the effect on a sample of selected emission - line objects and in sect .",
    "4 we briefly discuss our results and suggest their practical application .",
    "the aim of this paper requires the ratio of the continuum with the superposed emission lines to the line - removed continuum at all relevant wavelengths .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of this paper we express the observed flux in the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the true continuum ( i.e. line - removed continuum ) and @xmath14 represents the emission line spectrum in units of the continuum at the wavelength @xmath15 .",

    "we approximate the emission spectrum with an ensemble of gaussian functions , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wavelength of the i-@xmath23 line , @xmath24 its maximum in units of the local continuum and @xmath25 its hwhm . for the purpose of this work",

    "( 2 ) is complicated with modeling the true continuum ( sect .  3 ) .",
    "therefore , for the practical use , we suggest an approximate solution .      in this section",

    "\\(ii ) approximation of the @xmath19 functions by a polynomial function ( fig .  1 ,",
    "table  1 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the response function @xmath19 is constant within the line , because emission lines are relatively narrow with respect to the width of the photometric filter .",
    "\\(iv ) according to the relation ( 4 ) , we express the flux of the i-@xmath23 line in the continuum units as @xmath27 under these assumptions eq .",

    "both are determined for wavelengths in  . according to eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 6 ) , the @xmath2 corrections depend in great deal on the ratio of the line fluxes to the level of the local continuum and their position @xmath22 ( i.e. @xmath30 )",
    ". to derive appropriate @xmath2 corrections the spectrum can be in arbitrary units ( eq .  ( 2 ) ) .    .",
    "polynomial approximation of the transmission functions @xmath33 ( fig .  1 ) and the constants @xmath32 ( eq .  7 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the classical nova v1974cyg ( nova cygni 1992 ) was discovered by @xcite on 1992 february 19 .",
    "it reached a peak visual magnitude of 4.4 on 1992 february 20.7 ut @xcite .",
    "v1974cyg developed an emission line spectrum at early stages of its evolution .",
    "first nebular lines appeared in 1992 april and in 1992 september dominated the ultraviolet and optical spectrum @xcite . to demonstrate the effect of emission lines on the @xmath9 measurements we used observations from the nebular phase taken in 1992 september",
    "observations were dereddened with @xmath34 = 0.36 @xcite .",
    "we reconstructed the continuum using the low - resolution iue spectra swp45670 and lwp23967 exposed on 17/09/92 ( i.e. 210 days after the maximum ) and the optical / near - ir spectra published by @xcite .",
    "as the latter spectroscopy was not simultaneous with the former one , we interpolated spectra made at 40 and 400 days to 210 days after the maximum .",
    "it was possible , because the continuum profile did not change significantly ( cf . figs .  4 and 5 of * ?",
    "then we scaled fluxes from the near - uv to those of the iue observations and selected 12 flux - points in the continuum between 1280 and 8000 , considering the influence of the iron curtain as proposed by @xcite . following to s05 we modeled the continuum fluxes by a two - component - model including contributions from a star and nebula . in our model sed ( fig .",
    "6 ) the source of the stellar radiation has an effective radius @xmath35 and radiates at @xmath36 = 31000@xmath375000k , while the nebula radiates at @xmath38 = 44000@xmath375000k having the emission measure , @xmath39@xmath40 .",
    "we note that the observed stellar radiation is not capable of giving rise the nebular emission by photoionization , because of too low @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that a major part of the nebular radiation is due to collisions , which is consistent with its high electron temperature and the presence of a fast outflow from the nova .",
    "the line spectrum of v1974cyg was reconstructed according to observations of @xcite taken at 212 days ( see their figs .  5 and 6 ) and @xcite ( 211 days , table  7 ) , obtained nearly simultaneously with the ultraviolet observations .",
    "the @xmath9 measurements obtained on 17/09/92 were taken from @xcite .",
    "for v1974cyg the effect of emission lines on the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath41 magnitudes is significant : @xmath42 = 1.57 , @xmath43 = 1.73 , @xmath44 = 0.66 , @xmath45 = 0.94 and @xmath46 = 0.88mag .",
    "disagreement between the corrected @xmath5 magnitude and the predicted continuum at 5500  is caused by a large scatter in the @xmath5 measurements obtained at different observatories at the time of the presence of strong nebular emissions in the v1974cyg spectrum ( see fig .  8 of * ? ? ?",
    "note that the strongest nebular lines ( @xmath154959 and @xmath155007 ) are placed at the steep edge of the @xmath5 filter ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "deviations between @xmath2 corrections obtained by the accurate calculation ( eq .  2 ) and by our approximate relation ( eq .  6 ) are less than 10% for @xmath47 measurements",
    "( table  2 ) .",
    "a systematic shift for the @xmath1 passband ( @xmath48 ) is due to the slope of the red giant continuum here .",
    "this increases the effective wavelength of the @xmath1 filter and thus the contribution from the continuum , which results in a smaller ( correct ) @xmath2 than that estimated for a constant continuum ( cf .",
    "larger differences are for @xmath42 corrections , because of a marked difference between the true and the assumed constant continuum profile around the balmer discontinuity . to get a satisfactory result in @xmath3 for objects with a strong balmer jump in emission , we multiplied the sum in eq  ( 6 ) by a factor of 0.8 .",
    "corrections @xmath2 can be used to convert arbitrary flux units of an emission - line spectrum to fluxes in absolute units with the aid of the simultaneous @xmath49 photometry .",
    "the following steps are relevant .",
    "\\(i ) appropriate @xmath2 can be estimated according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) to obtain magnitudes of the line - removed continuum .",
    "\\(ii ) to deredden the continuum - magnitudes and convert them to fluxes as referred in sect .",
    "( iii ) a polynomial fit to the line corrected flux - points of the photometric passbands can be adopted as the true continuum . in special cases",
    "it is sufficient to limit this calibration just to one passband to get an appropriate scaling factor .",
    "usually this takes effect for a spectrum exposed within the @xmath41 band which contains one strongly dominant emission from h@xmath50  ( e.g. symbiotic stars ) . in this case",

    "a proper corrections for emission lines must be applied to model multicolour light curves of the outbursting objects , spectra of which are very rich for emission lines .",
    "for example , @xcite restricted their calculation of theoretical light curves of the 2006-outburst of the recurrent symbiotic nova rsoph only to the @xmath56 and @xmath57 filters to avoid contamination by the strong emission lines , although @xmath4 and @xmath58 measurements were also available .",
    "the effect of emission lines on the photometric measurements changes also the colour indices .",
    "generally , @xmath2 corrections are different in different passbands , which results in a relevant change in the colour indices of the true continuum . therefore , prior to a diagnostic of the emission - line objects by colour diagrams one has to correct the observed indices for the light excess due to the emission lines .",
    "this approach can be effectively used to study evolution of the composite spectra of , for example , symbiotic stars on the basis of their multicolour light curves .",
    "however , this represents rather sophisticated task and we will devote to this problem in a separate paper .",
    "we investigated the effect on the @xmath9 and @xmath41 magnitudes of the removal of the emission lines from the spectra of some classical symbiotic stars , symbiotic novae and the classical nova v1974cyg .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) we calculated the ratio of fluxes with and without the lines , transmitted through the given photometric filter , to obtain corrections @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 caused by emission lines .",
    "first , we approached this problem by a precise reconstruction of the true continuum ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "second , we derived a formula to estimate these corrections by a simple way for an operative use ( eq .  6 ) .",
    "deviations between @xmath2 corrections determined by both the methods are less than 10% .",
    "larger differences are in the @xmath3 passband , because of a complex profile of the true continuum at this region .",
    "\\(ii ) the removal of emission lines makes the star s brightness fainter by @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63mag for the selected symbiotic stars ( table  2 ) .",
    "the effect is larger for axper at the eclipse , because of the low level of the continuum ( e.g. @xmath64 and @xmath65mag ) .",
    "the largest corrections were found for the symbiotic novae and the nebular phase of the classical nova v1974cyg ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70mag ) , because of their very intense emission line spectrum . the significant effect in @xmath41 passbands is mainly due to a strong h@xmath50  emission and the high transmissivity of both @xmath58 and @xmath1 filters at @xmath71  ( eq .  ( 10 ) , table  1 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the line corrected @xmath49 flux - points fit well the modeled continuum ( figs .  2 and 46 ) .",
