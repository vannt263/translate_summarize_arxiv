    "in last years significant experimental progress has been achieved in studying properties of heavy baryons .",
    "masses of all ground states of charmed and bottom baryons have been measured except @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "many decay channels of these baryons were observed and new more precise data are expected in near future , since heavy baryons are copiously produced at lhc .",
    "weak decays of bottom baryons can serve as an additional source for the determination of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "such determination is particularly important since there exists some tension between the values of these matrix elements extracted from exclusive and inclusive bottom meson weak decays @xcite .",
    "very recently lhcb collaboration @xcite reported the first measurement of the ratio of the heavy - to - light semileptonic @xmath9 and heavy - to - heavy semileptonic @xmath10 decay rates in the constrained kinematical regions , thus providing data for determination of the ratio of the ckm matrix elements @xmath11 from baryon decays .    in order to calculate weak decay rates of bottom baryons",
    "it is necessary to determine the form factors which parametrize the matrix elements of the weak current between initial and final baryon states .",
    "these form factors depend on the momentum transfer from the initial baryon to the final baryon . in the case of semileptonic bottom baryon",
    "decays both to heavy and light final baryons the momentum transfer squared @xmath12 varies in a rather broad kinematical range .",
    "therefore it is very important to explicitly determine the @xmath12 dependence of decay form factors in the whole kinematical range .    in this paper",
    "we study semileptonic @xmath0 decays in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and qcd .",
    "this model was successfully applied for investigating various meson properties @xcite .",
    "the heavy and strange baryon spectroscopy was studied in the relativistic quark - diquark picture in refs .",
    "@xcite where masses and wave functions of the ground and excited baryon states were obtained .",
    "we also calculated the decay rates of heavy - to - heavy semileptonic baryon transitions @xcite using the heavy quark expansion .",
    "both infinitely heavy quark limit and first order @xmath13 corrections were considered .",
    "it was shown that our model satisfies all model independent relations following from the heavy quark symmetry @xcite . leading and subleading baryon isgur - wise functions",
    "were determined .",
    "it was found that @xmath13 corrections give larger contributions to heavy baryon decay rates than for heavy meson decay rates .",
    "indeed , for heavy meson decays the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xmath14 parameter is determined by the light quark energy while for heavy baryon decays this parameter is proportional to the light diquark energy which is almost 2 times larger .",
    "here we calculate the weak decay form factors without employing the heavy quark expansion .",
    "this allows us to improve previous results and to consider simultaneously heavy - to - heavy and heavy - to - light semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
