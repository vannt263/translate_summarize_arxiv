    "+ _ in situ _ spacecraft observations of fluctuations in solar wind parameters such as velocity and magnetic field ( for example , @xcite in the ecliptic plane and @xcite in polar flows ) typically reveal an inertial range ( ir ) of turbulence with a `` @xmath6 '' inverse power - law scaling at high frequencies and a flatter `` @xmath0''-like scaling range at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "the breakpoint between these two ranges is seen to evolve radially @xcite with the inertial range extending to lower frequencies with increasing radial distance , suggesting a turbulent energy cascade in the solar wind .",
    "the solar wind also has a background magnetic field and is therefore a highly anisotropic plasma environment @xcite .",
    "the strength of this background field relative to the amplitude of the fluctuations determines whether the turbulence is `` strong '' , i.e the amplitude of fluctuations is comparable to that of the background magnetic field @xcite or `` weak '' , i.e the background magnetic field is dominant @xcite .",

    "* ) , unlike the turbulence seen at higher frequency , which is locally evolving .",
    "the location of the spectral breakpoint point between the inertial and `` @xmath0 '' ranges depends on latitude and radial distance , but it is always possible to see `` @xmath0 '' scaling at low frequencies . the power spectral density ( psd ) of the `` @xmath0 '' range in the interplanetary magnetic field has been extensively studied by @xcite and at @xmath8 au in the magnitude of the solar wind bulk velocity @xmath9 and magnetic field @xmath5 by @xcite .",
    "there is also an extensive body of work on the gaussian and non - gaussian properties of pdfs of fluctuations in solar wind parameters at these very large scales @xcite and over a wide range of heliospheric radii .",
    "@xcite used large scale velocity fluctuations at @xmath8 au on timescales of one hour to a year to quantify the standard deviation , kurtosis and skewness of pdfs over these scales .",

    "for the first time we consider components of @xmath9 and @xmath5 defined relative to the local magnetic field , and we systematically distinguish between intervals of fast and slow solar wind at solar maximum and minimum . here",
    "we will focus on the anisotropy of the fluctuations by using a novel decomposition technique , and will take advantage of the long timeseries available from the advanced composition explorer ( @xmath10 ) spacecraft to compare not only fast and slow solar wind streams but also periods of minimum and maximum solar activity .",
    "+ in the inertial range , vector quantities such as _ in situ _ velocity and magnetic field can be resolved for components both parallel and perpendicular with respect to the background magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the duration of the timescale over which the background field is computed is important and both large scale @xmath5 @xcite and average local @xmath5 as a function of the scale of the fluctuations @xcite have been considered in the context of inertial range turbulence . in terms of quantifying scaling , these approaches are generic and the focus of the present paper is to incorporate these ideas in statistical studies of the `` @xmath0 '' range , since we anticipate that coronal processes and the transport or propagation of coronal structures will depend on orientation with respect to the background magnetic field .",
    "the observed scaling would also be anticipated to depend quantitatively on solar cycle and to differ between fast ( @xmath11 km / s ) or slow ( @xmath12km / s ) solar wind streams .",
    "high speed flows originate in coronal holes @xcite , whereas low speed flows arise from dense coronal streamers @xcite , while solar rotation causes high and low speed flows to interact at low latitudes .",
    "we will perform generalised structure function analysis ( gsf ) @xcite on datasets spanning these intervals in order to quantify the scaling properties of the magnetic and velocity field fluctuations both parallel and perpendicular to the background magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "+ the location of the spectral breakpoint between the inertial and `` @xmath0 '' ranges differs in fast and slow streams @xcite , presumably because at a given heliocentric distance the turbulence in the slow solar wind has had more time to develop than in the fast solar wind .",
    "furthermore , the crossover between ir and `` @xmath0 '' is much clearer in fast than in slow solar wind . here , we will see that projecting velocity and magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to @xmath5 provides a clear indicator of where this crossover occurs .",
    "we compare the position of this breakpoint in fast and slow solar wind streams and at periods of maximum and minimum solar activity .",
    "we first see that the psds of the vector components of the velocity @xmath9 and magnetic field @xmath5 suggest anisotropy in the `` @xmath0 '' range .",
    "we then decompose @xmath9 and @xmath5 into parallel and perpendicular fluctuations with respect to the local background magnetic field @xmath5 . for the simple case of quiet fast solar wind",
    ", we compare the pdfs of the fluctuations to see which components may or may not share the same underlying generating process . for completeness",
    ", we also consider the pdf for the density fluctuations @xmath13 .",
    "we compare the gsfs for fast and slow solar wind at solar maximum and minimum . finally ,",

    "+ we first provide an overview of the `` @xmath0 '' range of these data intervals by plotting the power spectral density @xmath29 of the components of @xmath9 and @xmath5 in the @xmath30 coordinate system , where @xmath31 is the sun - spacecraft axis , @xmath32 is the cross product of @xmath31 with the solar rotation axis , and @xmath33 is the cross product of @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",

    "we take our original intervals of fast and slow solar wind and truncate ( or cut ) them such that they all have the same length of @xmath39 datapoints .",
    "each interval is then split up into windows of @xmath40 points with a @xmath41 overlap on the previous window .",
    "a hamming window is applied to each of these sub - intervals and the fft is computed .",
    "an average is then taken of these sub - interval ffts to obtain the power spectrum for each interval .",
    "the power spectra for all intervals are then averaged to obtain the psds for fast and slow solar wind at both solar maximum and minimum . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the magnetic field power spectrum @xmath42 shows a spectral slope @xmath43 .",
    "plotting @xmath44 should therefore give a horizontal line ( on average ) .",

    "figure [ fig.1 ] covers the expected region of transition in the spectral index of @xmath9 and @xmath5 between the ir and `` @xmath0 '' frequency ranges .",
    "however it is difficult to tell precisely whether , for example , the psd behaviour between @xmath45hz and @xmath46hz really is `` @xmath2 , @xmath47 '' , particularly in the slow solar wind",
    ". it also evident from figure [ fig.1 ] that in some cases in the `` @xmath2 '' range @xmath4 varies with the solar cycle and with solar wind speed , and that for both @xmath9 and @xmath5 the @xmath4 can vary from one component to another , and between @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "this implies anisotropy in the fluctuations and distinct scaling between @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "+ from a statistical point of view , let us now characterize this anisotropy by decomposing the velocity ( or magnetic ) field fluctuations into parallel and perpendicular components relative to the background magnetic field .",
    "we adopt the taylor hypothesis @xcite to relate spatial and temporal scales and fluctuations over a time lag @xmath48 in the velocity ( or magnetic field ) vector components , defined as @xmath49 . a vector average for the magnetic field direction @xmath50",
    "is formed from a vector sum @xmath51 of all the observed vector @xmath5 values between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it follows that in computing fluctuations over @xmath48 , the background field is averaged over @xmath54 , which then defines the minimum ( nyquist ) interval necessary to capture wavelike fluctuations @xcite . using this definition of @xmath55 , the inner product @xmath56 vanishes for fluctuations which generate a velocity displacement that is purely perpendicular to the background magnetic field @xmath57 as defined .",
    "the perpendicular fluctuation amplitude is then obtained from @xmath58 we use these definitions to construct differenced timeseries @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 over a range of @xmath48 intervals within the `` @xmath0 '' range , that is @xmath48 from a few hours up to a day . +",
    "we first examine the pdfs of these fluctuations and explore their possible functional forms . for a self - affine process ,",

    "note that since we normalised the curves to @xmath79 and @xmath66 , an exact fit would have been @xmath80 and @xmath81 here .",
    "in contrast , the normalised pdfs of the @xmath68 fluctuations in the `` @xmath0 '' range also shown in figure [ fig.2 ] are clearly not gaussian . here",

    "there is little difference between the raw and collapsed pdfs , as @xmath104 is closer to `` @xmath0 '' scaling .",

    "we see that they are almost identical .",
    "a possible interpretation is that both sets of fluctuations have the same physical process at their origin . + for completeness , we also examine the ion density fluctuations @xmath13 in the fast quiet solar wind . from @xcite",

    "the density pdfs have very sharp peaks with extended tails and are asymmetric .",
    "the rescaling collapse works well at the centre of the pdfs , but not towards the tails .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us summarise our analysis of the pdfs of fluctuations in the fast quiet solar wind .",
    "figures [ fig.2 ] and [ fig.3 ] ( right - hand sides ) show scaling collapse for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig.4 ] ( left - hand side ) shows that @xmath67 and @xmath73 are distinct .",

    "the finite length of the datasets considered means that the statistics calculated for any given single ensemble can in principle be affected by the presence of large outliers , which are insufficiently numerous to be fully sampled .",
    "we check that this does not bias our results via the method of @xcite , which by subtracting outliers verifies whether calculated exponents are robust against statistical fluctuations in the outliers .",
    "the raw and @xmath120 conditioned gsfs are shown for comparison in figure [ fig.7 ] .",
    "for the low - order moments that we consider here , we see that the difference is small , so that the finite length of our datasets does not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "the raw data is used for the plots of the probability densities of the fluctuations in section @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig.7 ] is consistent with the results shown previously , namely that @xmath9 and @xmath5 fluctuations exhibit very different behaviour in the `` @xmath0 '' range , which corresponds to large @xmath48 intervals . a simple self - affine noise process with psd@xmath121 , @xmath7 would on such a plot have @xmath122 since @xmath123",

    "this is what we have seen in the pdf curve renormalization of the previous section : the @xmath15 raw pdfs were close to the renormalised pdfs , since the normalization is with respect to the first two moments @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which for @xmath15 vary weakly as a function of scale @xmath48 .",
    "equation [ eqn4 ] tells one that the scaling behaviour of the process is contained in the @xmath110 exponents , given by the slopes of the gsfs .",
    "we obtain these values by linear fits to the log - log gsf plots .",
    "+ whilst these results confirm the `` @xmath0 '' scaling of fluctuations in @xmath5 on long timescales , reported previously by for example @xcite , they also highlight the distinct scaling of @xmath9 , which we will investigate next . these gsf plots of fluctuations oriented with respect to the background field",
    "also clearly show the crossover between the ir and `` @xmath0 '' for fast and slow solar wind .",
    "the `` @xmath0 '' range is much shorter in the slow streams , consistent with previous observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however @xmath67 does , while the solar cycle dependence of @xmath73 is indeterminate .",
    "the divergences at @xmath134 in the fast solar wind at solar maximum may be due to finite size effects : the dataset for solar maximum is shorter than for solar minimum , because there are fewer long continuous time periods of fast solar wind .",
    "figures [ fig.8 ] and [ fig.9 ] also show that the scaling properties of all four fluctuating quantities in the slow solar wind differ between solar maximum and minimum , due to different scaling exponents or a different breakpoint location .",
    "+ let us summarise our conclusions from the gsf analysis .",
    "first , the breakpoints between the scaling properties measured by gsf analysis are different between fast and slow solar wind streams , and between periods of maximum and minimum solar activity",
    ". these breakpoints do not necessarily coincide with the breakpoint between ir and `` @xmath0 '' ranges inferred from spectral analysis , however as mentioned earlier , it is difficult to extract precise quantitative information from the power spectra plots .",
    "the ir extends to longer timescales in slow solar wind streams and at periods of maximum solar activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these trends are particularly clear in the gsfs of the perpendicular components in figure [ fig.9 ] .",
    "the inertial range remains relatively robust for both slow and fast solar wind streams and is independent of solar cycle .",
    "this is to be expected if the ir is established by a turbulent cascade within the evolving expanding solar wind , rather than by initial conditions in the corona . intriguingly , @xmath68 and @xmath74 have the same behaviour in the `` @xmath0 '' range for fast solar wind at both solar maximum and minimum .",
    "their scaling looks similar for the slow solar wind , but the breakpoint moves to longer timescales at solar maximum .",
    "all four quantities vary between fast and slow solar wind and solar minimum and maximum .",
    "let us now quantify the observed scaling by measuring the slopes of the gsfs to obtain estimates of the values of the scaling exponents , @xmath110 ; the robustness of the scaling will also be tested . in principle , values for @xmath110 are obtained from the gradients of the log - log plots of @xmath135 versus @xmath48 . in practice",
    ", these are affected by the fact that both the length of the dataset , and the range of @xmath48 over which we see scaling , are finite . as a preliminary",
    ", therefore , we outline a method to optimise this process to obtain a good estimate of the exponents .",
    "we begin by considering a simple self - affine process where @xmath136 , @xmath113 . a fractal ( self - affine )",
    "timeseries will in principle always give the same value of @xmath63 if computed from any region , or range of values , of the pdf of fluctuations ( differences ) sampled across a timescale @xmath48 .",
    "we seek to choose the most statistically significant subset , and we do this by recomputing @xmath63 for different regions of the pdf ; if the process is fractal , we expect to find the same @xmath63 . to probe the full range of behaviour in the pdf , including any extended tails , we need to test for convergence to a single value of @xmath63 for a wide dynamic range of the pdf , for example @xmath137 .",
    "the largest values explored by the pdf of the data are the least well sampled statistically .",
    "it follows that if we successively remove these outliers , we should see , for a fractal timeseries , rapid convergence to a constant @xmath63 value .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig.10 ] top panel for a brownian walk , see also @xcite .",
    "the scaling for a brownian walk with normally distributed steps demonstrates the expected behaviour for a fractal process without heavy tails . on the other hand a multifractal process does not return a single constant value of @xmath63 as one changes the range of values over which @xmath63 is computed ; this can be seen for the multifractal p - process @xcite in the lower panel of figure [ fig.10 ] .",
    "a plot of the value of the exponent ( here @xmath112 ) as we succesively remove outliers then can distinguish fractal and multifractal processes . for processes that are fractal",
    ", it also provides a more precise determination of the single exponent @xmath63 that characterizes the timeseries .",
    "the errors are obtained by combining the least squares error in the @xmath110 value fitted across the full range , with the standard deviation of the @xmath110 values fitted across runs of data points that have varying lengths , starting with a minimum length of about half the total fitting range length , centered on the middle of the full fitting range .",
    "this method is applied for all the exponent statistics throughout this paper .",

    "for @xmath68 the slow solar wind displays a much higher exponent value for slow ( @xmath144 ) than for fast ( @xmath145 ) streams , reflecting the intrinsic differences between the fast and slow solar wind , and the coronal plasma conditions and magnetic field configuration at their origin .    to summarize the observed results : analysis of the scaling exponents reveals fractal or weakly multi - fractal ( very close to monofractal ) scaling in the fluctuations of velocity components in the fast solar wind , with very different values for @xmath67 ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath68 ( @xmath145 ) at solar minimum . in the slow solar wind at solar minimum",
    ", the scaling exponent @xmath112 of @xmath68 nearly doubles from @xmath147 to @xmath148 .",
    "in contrast , the scaling of @xmath67 remains quantitatively similar to its value in the fast wind ( figure [ fig.12 ] ) , i. e. @xmath146 but has a less well - defined monofractal character .",
    "finally , if we assume a regime in which the psd @xmath149 scaling exponent @xmath4 is related to @xmath112 by @xmath123 , then we obtain for the fast quiet solar wind : @xmath7 for @xmath15 ( as expected from figure [ fig.1 ] ) , @xmath150 for @xmath67 and @xmath151 for @xmath68 .",
    "we have examined the scaling of the parallel and perpendicular velocity and magnetic field fluctuations measured in the solar wind at @xmath16 au by ace , which we have decomposed with respect to a locally averaged background magnetic field .",
    "power spectra , gsfs and pdf collapse have been used to qualify and quantify the nature of the observed scaling in the low frequency `` @xmath0 '' range .",
    "slow and fast solar wind streams have been compared at both solar maximum in @xmath19 and solar minimum in @xmath18 .",
    "the slow solar wind is found to be more multifractal and complex than the fast solar wind .",
    "+ the magnetic field fluctuations display a flattening of the gsfs for @xmath152 minutes and a spectral index @xmath1 , consistent with @xmath126 behaviour found previously @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the velocity fluctuations show strong anisotropy , with scaling behaviour distinct from that of the @xmath153 field and characterized by steepening of the gsfs in the `` @xmath0 '' range ( figure [ fig.7 ] ) consistent with @xmath154 .",
    "+ for the fast quiet solar wind , @xmath67 and @xmath68 have different scaling exponents : @xmath67 exhibits fractal scaling with @xmath155 whereas @xmath68 is weakly multifractal with @xmath156 ( figure [ fig.11 ] ) .",
    "the pdfs for these quantities also rescale relatively well . also in the fast quiet solar wind , the pdf of @xmath67 is close to gaussian , whereas @xmath73 is nearly symmetric and has stretched exponential tails , consistent with a multiplicative process .",
    "the rescaled pdfs for @xmath68 and @xmath74 in the fast solar wind can be fitted with the same distribution function , which is close to gamma or inverse gumbel ( see figure [ fig.5 ] ) .",
    "however their scaling exponents revealed by gsfs differ substantially ( see figure [ fig.9 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with a common coronal source for the fluctuations but a different spatiotemporal evolution out to @xmath8au .",
    "the functional form of the pdf then constrains the mechanism that generates the fluctuations at the corona , gamma having points of contact with turbulence in confined plasmas ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and gumbel , as an extremal process .",
    "+ the breakpoint between the inertial range and `` @xmath0 '' ranges differs between fast and slow solar wind streams and between periods of maximum and minimum solar activity .",
    "the inertial range extends to longer timescales in slow solar wind streams and at periods of maximum solar activity .",
    "the values of the inertial range scaling exponents remain unaffected by changes in the solar cycle ( figure [ fig.8 ] and figure [ fig.9 ] ) , consistent with locally generated turbulence .",
    "+ our results clearly show very different behaviour between the magnetic and velocity fluctuations in the `` @xmath0 '' range .",
    "the fractal nature of @xmath67 points to distinct physical processes in the corona , and to their mapping out into the solar wind . further work would involve relating the fractal scaling observed at @xmath1au with fractal stirring of magnetic footpoints in the corona .",
    "the different scaling observed in @xmath68 points to different dynamics perpendicular to the background field ( field line interactions ? ) with a possible common coronal origin the the @xmath68 and @xmath74 fluctuations . in fast quiet solar wind",
