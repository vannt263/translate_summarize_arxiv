    "for the past two decades there has been an ever growing interest in quantifying and characterizing the correlations in the states of quantum systems .",
    "this was initially provoked by the realization that quantum correlations known as entanglement could be harnessed as a resource to bring significant advantage for computing and information processing @xcite .",
    "now , one of the main interests is to identify which correlations are responsible for these advantages .",
    "moreover , it has been recognized that quantifying correlations in quantum systems is a difficult task and , in general , several measures are needed to capture all of their subtleties .    in order to understand correlations ,",
    "one generally starts with bipartite systems .",
    "consider two quantum systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the state of the composite system @xmath3 can be described by a density operator @xmath4 which contains both classical and quantum correlations .",
    "a widely accepted measure of the total correlations in @xmath4 is the _ quantum mutual information_. it is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the density operator of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath8 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of @xmath9 ( the trace is taken in the state space where @xmath9 is a density operator ) .",
    "it has been found that @xmath10 is the distance ( as measured by the relative entropy ) of @xmath4 to its closest product state @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that @xmath10 measures the asymptotically minimal amount of local noise one has to add to turn @xmath4 into a product state @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is the maximum amount of information that alice can send secretly to bob using @xmath4 as a one - time pad @xcite .",
    "once the total correlations in @xmath4 have been quantified , it is natural to ask whether these can be clearly divided into a classical and quantum part .",
    "several axioms have been proposed as requirements of a measure of the classical correlations @xmath12 in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these consist in being zero for product states , being invariant under local unitary transformations and non - increasing under local operations , and being equal to @xmath13 for pure states @xmath4 . also , it has been pointed out that a measure of the classical correlations should quantify the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 instead of a property of only one of them , that is , it should be symmetric under interchange of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "taking these axioms as a basis , the following measures for the classical correlations in @xmath4 have been proposed @xcite : @xmath14 where the minimum is taken over all sets @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of one - dimensional orthogonal projectors that sum up to the identity and that constitute measurements performed only on @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "also , @xmath17 \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath18 \\ , \\ ] ] is the density operator of @xmath1 after obtaining the result associated with @xmath19 in a measurement of @xmath2 ( similar equations hold for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "these measures satisfy the axioms mentioned above and are equal to zero if and only if @xmath22 .",
    "hence , it is in accordance with the accepted idea that only product states are devoid of correlations .",
    "nevertheless , these measures are dependent on which system is measured , that is , @xmath23 in general .",
    "thus it depends on the properties of each subsystem .",
    "more recently , other measures and notions of classical correlations have been proposed @xcite , @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been proposed that the classical correlations should be quantified by the minimum distance ( as measured by the relative entropy ) between a classically correlated state associated with @xmath4 and a product state @xcite .",
    "this last proposal has the advantage of placing all correlations ( total , quantum , and classical ) on an equal footing that allows a direct comparison between all of them @xcite .",
    "given that the classical part of the correlations is not yet clearly quantified , let us now turn to quantum correlations .",
    "quantum states @xmath4 are normally divided into separable or entangled .",
    "let us remember that @xmath4 is separable if it can be expressed in the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) density operators of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and @xmath27 $ ] such that @xmath28 . if @xmath4 is not a separable state , then it is an entangled one .",
    "it was thought that entanglement embodied all the quantum correlations in @xmath4 , and that separable states were purely classical .",
    "nevertheless , it has been realized that entanglement is not the only aspect of quantum correlations , since some separable states may still present non - classical correlations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one way to measure the non - classicality of the correlations in @xmath4 is to use the quantum discord @xcite .",
    "this quantity is defined to be the difference between the quantum mutual information ( [ qmi ] ) and the correlations ( [ correlacionclasica ] ) : @xmath29 @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is usually referred to as the left ( right ) quantum discord .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath32 are always non - negative @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath33 if and only if @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath1 , @xmath36 are density operators of @xmath2 , and @xmath37 are non - negative numbers such that @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40 where @xmath35 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath2 , @xmath36 are density operators of @xmath1 , and @xmath37 are non - negative numbers such that @xmath38 .    in general @xmath41",
    ". the quantum discord @xmath31 can be interpreted to be a measure of the information of @xmath1 in @xmath4 that can not be extracted by performing measurements only on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "hence , if @xmath31 is large , a lot of information is destroyed by any measurement on @xmath2 alone ; if @xmath31 is small , almost all the information about @xmath1 in @xmath4 can be obtained by measurements only on @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "once quantum discord is recognized as a measure of non - classical correlations , it is natural to ask if it measures the same correlations as entanglement . given that some separable mixed states have non - zero quantum discord and separable states by definition do not have entanglement , it is concluded that entanglement and quantum discord are in general different quantities .",
    "nevertheless , they do coincide when @xmath4 is a pure state or a mixture of bell states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that in general the quantum discord of @xmath4 is not simply the sum of some measure of the entanglement in @xmath4 and some other non - classical correlation @xcite , @xcite .    the study of the dynamics of quantum correlations is intimately linked to the study of open quantum systems , that is , quantum systems which are coupled to other quantum systems called environment @xcite .",
    "when the environment has many degrees of freedom ( a reservoir ) , it normally induces a loss of coherence in the system of interest that ultimately has a detrimental effect on the correlations present in it .",
    "for example , entanglement may decay exponentially with time or may vanish completely in a finite time ( called _ entanglement sudden death _ ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , the environment can also affect the degree of mixed - ness of the state of the system of interest @xcite , and this in turn also affects the entanglement since it is known that a mixed state can not have an arbitrary degree of entanglement @xcite .",
    "recently , the open system dynamics of both the quantum discord and classical correlations have started to be studied @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular it has been found that under markovian environments quantum discord may be more robust than entanglement @xcite . for non - markovian environments and independent reservoirs for each part of a bipartite system , the quantum discord may vanish only at discrete instants whereas the entanglement can disappear during a finite time interval . for a common reservoir",
    ", quantum discord and entanglement can behave very differently with sudden birth of the former but not of the latter @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to study the entanglement , quantum discord , classical correlations , and degree of mixed - ness in the steady - state of the following open quantum system : two two - level atoms ( qubits in the jargon of quantum information ) at fixed positions driven by a monochromatic laser field and interacting collectively with all the modes of the quantum electromagnetic field .",
    "the latter will be assumed to be in the vacuum state . in the notation",
    "used above , @xmath1 will be one of the atoms ( say , the atom at position @xmath42 ) and @xmath2 will be the other atom ( say , the atom at position @xmath43 ) . here",
    "we also have a third party @xmath44 playing a decisive role in the dynamics : the vacuum electromagnetic field which we will consider as a reservoir .",
    "the system is open because we are interested in studying only the subsystem @xmath45 of the complete system @xmath46 . since the two atoms are interacting collectively with the reservoir , @xmath44 acts as a medium that can allow quantum correlations to be formed between the two atoms for some time . in order that these correlations have the possibility of being long - lived and not being ultimately destroyed by the reservoir ,",
    "the two atoms will be driven by a laser field .",
    "we will investigate in detail two configurations for the two atoms .",
    "in the first , one of the atoms will be placed in a position where the laser electric field is zero , while the other atom will located at a position where it is not zero . in the second",
    ", each atom will be placed in a position where the driving electric field takes the same value .",
    "these two configurations will allow us to study how the correlations change when the atoms are in equivalent / non - equivalent positions and to determine what is the effect when both atoms are being driven by the laser field .",
    "it is important to mention that we will neglect the coherent dipole - dipole interaction between the two atoms that results of the collective interaction with the reservoir .",
    "we will only keep the dissipative collective interaction with the reservoir .",
    "this will allow us to calculate a steady - state density operator of the two atoms analytically , as well as , all the aforementioned correlations in it .",
    "furthermore , this will allow us to identify which effects are due solely to the dissipative interaction .",
    "in future work we will add the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "using the same system as ours , but without the driving field , the dynamical generation of entanglement between two atoms due to the collective interaction with the reservoir has been recently studied @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was found that , as a result of the interaction through the reservoir , the system develops non - negligible entanglement ( as measured by the concurrence ) for a period of time if the atoms are close enough and if initially one is in the excited state and the other is in the ground state .",
    "also , it was reported that entanglement initially present in the system of two atoms is more robust when the two atoms are close when compared to the case where the atoms are far apart .",
    "the entanglement present in a system of two driven non - identical two - level atoms in a special configuration ( namely one atom is located at a node while the other atom is placed at an antinode of a driving laser field with a standing wave cosine structure ) has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the steady - state density operator of the system was obtained numerically and the concurrence was evaluated .",
    "it was found that the two atom system decays to a stationary entangled state only when the rabi frequency equals the difference between the two atoms transition frequencies .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we summarize some results on measures of correlations for two qubit systems . in section",
    "iii the system of interest is described and the master equation governing the dynamics of the two atoms is established . in section iv ,",
    "the steady - state density operator is calculated analytically for the case of only one atom being driven by the laser field .",
    "the populations of the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian of the two atoms , the degree of entanglement , the quantum discord , and the degree of mixed - ness of the two atoms are evaluated as functions of the laser field intensity and of the distance between the atoms . in section",
    "v , the steady - state density operator of the two atoms is calculated analytically for the case of equal coupling strengths .",
    "the same analysis of section iv is done for this new configuration .",
    "furthermore , the results of both configurations are compared .",
    "the conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "in this article we will be considering two two - level atoms ( qubits ) which we will number by @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the following sections these labels will correspond to the atom at position @xmath42 and to the atom at position @xmath43 , respectively . in terms of the notation of the introduction",
    ", @xmath47 will replace @xmath1 , while @xmath48 will replace @xmath2 .",
    "we will now show how to calculate all correlations by simple formulas . we will only give the algorithms and refer the interested reader to the original articles for the proofs .",
    "the kets @xmath49  and  @xmath50  will denote the excited and ground states of the @xmath51th atom ( @xmath52 ) , respectively . in the following we will be making constant use of the triplet - singlet basis @xmath53 for the state space of the two atoms : @xmath54 we shall also use the usual tensor product basis @xmath55 where @xmath56 furthermore , we will denote the density operator of the two atoms by @xmath57 .",
    "we are interested in quantifying the degree of entanglement of the system of two atoms .",
    "we will use the concurrence @xmath58 , which can be calculated as @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath61_{\\mathsf{b } ' } ( \\sigma_{y } \\otimes \\sigma_{y } ) [ \\rho_{12 } ] _ { \\mathsf{b}'}^ { * }   ( \\sigma_{y } \\otimes \\sigma_{y } ) \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath62 is the well - known pauli matrix , @xmath63_{\\mathsf{b}'}$ ] is the matrix representation of @xmath57 in the basis @xmath64 , and @xmath63_{\\mathsf{b}'}^{*}$ ] is the element - wise complex conjugate of the density matrix @xmath63_{\\mathsf{b}'}$ ] . note that any basis of the state space of the two atoms related to the tensor product basis by an orthogonal change of coordinates matrix can be used for the matrix representations ( for example , @xmath65 could be used instead of @xmath64 ) .",
    "the concurrence takes values between @xmath66 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is @xmath47 when the atoms are in a maximally entangled state , while it is zero when the atoms are in a separable state .",
    "evaluation of the quantum discord given by ( [ qd ] ) in general requires considerable numerical minimization .",
    "although a method to calculate easily the classical correlation and quantum discord for a general two - qubit @xmath0-state has been proposed @xcite , it has been found to be unreliable because it does not take into account all of the restrictions in the minimization problem @xcite .",

    "we observe that as state becomes more mixed , the degree of entanglement increases until @xmath307 reaches a certain value , after which the degree of entanglement decays to zero , figure ( [ concslg20 ] ) .",

    "<S> inequivalent positions lead to the possibility of considerable steady - state entanglement and left / right quantum discord . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that an @xmath0-state can be obtained for high laser field intensities for both configurations . </S>",
