    "the concept of absolute , motion independent time is the result of our experience on the surface of the earth , where the motions are slow and there is an apparently fixed background reference frame .",
    "however , the space is relative also in this case , it is different for different observers : the so - called non - relativistic space - time is galilean relativistic . with the help of the notions of special relativistic space - time ,",
    "the heuristic concepts of our everyday experience can be clarified and an exact mathematical model of galilean relativistic space - time can be formulated @xcite .    in spite of our seemingly self confident knowledge about slow motions of everyday life ,",
    "such kind of exact space - time model is unavoidable to formulate and handle fundamental physical principles .",
    "if a physical phenomena happens without interacting with an observer , then one may find useful an adequate mathematical model , where this independent existence is reflected .",
    "furthermore , considering the tempestuous history of concepts about space and time , this kind of model seems to be unavoidable .",
    "the mathematical notions in a physical theory are not simple tools , they are the building blocks , the material of the whole building .",
    "the shape and flexibility of blocks contributes to the stability of the construction . with properly formed blocks one can spare the mortar of imagination for a better use : for the design of the building and for other conceptual questions .",
    "a good example of the importance of proper building material may be elimination of space coordinates in classical field theories with the help of more abstract notions of vectors and tensors .",
    "coordinate free concepts improve the focus on fundamental notions and are also helpful to develop better calculation methods in engineering .",
    "this work is an argument why reference frames should be avoided , and it provide tools how they can be eliminated , similarly to coordinates , from theories of continua .",
    "our example is single component fluid mechanics in this case .",
    "time is absolute in galilean - relativistic space - time , it is the same for different observers , in other words , it is independent of reference frames . in the following the adjective",
    "_ absolute _ will be used in this sense for other reference frame free physical quantities , too .",
    "other similar concepts , like objective or covariant , are mostly avoided .",
    "there are two points where our treatment is simplified .",
    "first , it has been long known that space and time are not vector spaces but better represented by affine spaces , because none of them have a canonical center @xcite . in this work",
    "the affine character of galilean space - time is not crucial , therefore we use a vector representation for it .",
    "second , we do not deal with the exact mathematical representation of physical units , nevertheless , it is interesting both from conceptual and practical points of view @xcite .",
    "the definition of the complete space - time model is given in the appendix .",
    "_ absolute time is not a subspace of the galilean relativistic space - time_. this is the critical , hidden problem of the usual superficial representations of galilean relativistic space - time . at first",
    "it seems to be less important than the mentioned center and unit dependencies .",
    "however , if we represent space - time by a cartesian product of the one dimensional time and three dimensional space , or even worse by @xmath0 , our theory is unavoidably reference frame dependent .",
    "the proper representation of the absolute time has consequences .",
    "one of them is , that in non - relativistic physical theories space - time four - covectors can not be identified with four - vectors and they transform differently when the reference frame changes .",
    "an other consequence is that the trace of a second order space - time four - tensor or a four - cotensor does not exist ; only a mixed four - tensor has a trace . in this respect the galilean relativistic space - time is not a specific low speed limit of special relativistic or general relativistic ones .",
    "the operations with space - time quantities are different from the usual relativistic operations , require care despite familiarity in special or general relativistic calculations .",
    "for example , here some components of four - quantities , and not only the complete quantity , may be reference frame independent : the timelike component of a vector and the spacelike component of a covector is absolute .",
    "several problematic aspects of non - relativistic physics are due to inappropriate space - time models :    1 .",
    "_ principle of material frame indifference .",
    "_ this principle formulates a simple and evident(looking ) property , postulating that the material must be independent of the reference frame , therefore the physical quantities , laws , equations of motions and material functions must reflect this requirement . in the usual formulations of the principle ,",
    "the required invariance under various transformation rules is restricted to three dimensional spatial vectors and tensors . according to the usual explanations this restriction is due to the absolute time . for point masses",
    "one expects invariance for galilean transformations related to inertial reference frames . for continua",
    "this is not enough , therefore invariance under rigid body motions of the reference frame is required .",
    "this most accepted formulation is due to walter noll ( @xcite , see also in @xcite ) .",
    "the principle and also its formulation initiated a long and unfinished discussion among those who are interested in the fundamental aspects of continuum physics .",
    "here we give an incomplete list of the most important looking related works @xcite .",
    "+ with the help of the galilean relativistic space - time model one can show that the formal invariance ( independency of the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame ) is a wrong requirement , because reference frame independency is not always invariance , sometimes it requires that the characteristics of the relative motion appear in the transformation rules @xcite , as it is evident in case of galilean transformations .",
    "moreover , from a space - time point of view the formulation of material frame indifference of noll is self - contradictory @xcite .",
    "deformation measures .",
    "_ not only the constitutive functions , but also the basic fields of continuum mechanics are expected to be frame indifferent .",
    "one of the most discussed quantities in this respect is the finite elastic deformation .",
    "one can define infinite number of deformation measures that are objective in the sense of noll , and even more that are not .",
    "it is remarkable that the space - time requirements distinguish a single concept of deformation @xcite , which turned out to be advantageous from other points of view , too @xcite .",
    "3 .   _ flow - frames . _ a different problem concerns the basic field of fluid theory , the velocity of the fluid . according to a recent idea of howard brenner ,",
    "the velocities in the mass , momentum and energy balances are not evidently the same .",
    "this idea has a long history @xcite and it is analogous to the problem of flow - frames in case of relativistic fluids @xcite . what is the velocity of the fluid ? what defines the motion from a physical point of view ?",
    "the mass , the momentum , the energy or something else ?",
    "do we have a choice ?",
    "in the usual fluid equations the velocities are relative velocities , therefore one must consider the role of the space - time to get a reliable answer .",
    "compatibility with special relativity .",
    "_ one may like to see the correspondence of physical quantities of galilean relativistic fluids and special relativistic fluids beyond the usual comparison of relative quantities .",
    "in special relativity the basic quantity is the covariant second order energy - momentum density four - tensor .",
    "the energy is the time - timelike part of this tensor and the transformation properties of the energy are consequences of this fact . what could be a similar physical quantity in galilean relativity",
    "_ the origin of transformation rules .",
    "_ the energy , e.g. the kinetic energy , when expressed by the relative velocity is definitely relative and frame dependent .",
    "is there an objective physical quantity behind the energy ?",
    "do we know the transformation rules of the non - relativistic energy ?",
    "what about the transformation rules of other physical quantities , like tensors and covectors",
    "_ compatibility with kinetic theory . _",
    "the consistency with statistical physics , more properly with kinetic theory raises some questions , too .",
    "for example momentum series expansion of kinetic theory is informative regarding transformation rules of macroscopic quantities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the method of derivation of continuum equations ( by chapman - enskog or momentum series expansion ) is informative regarding the thermodynamics of fluids . for example",
    "the internal energy is determined in a close relation with the pressure .",
    "is there an aspect in phenomenological continuum physics , where the hierarchical structure of momentum equations seems to be natural ? on the other hand , at the same time , nonrelativistic kinetic theory is considered as reference frame dependent , mostly due to macroscopic , phenomenological considerations ( e.g. transformation properties of the heat flux @xcite ) .",
    "this is a fundamental contradiction with general aspects of relativistic theories .",
    "_ thermodynamics .",
    "_ one may think , that thermodynamic relations are inherently absolute , because they express directly properties of materials .",
    "covariance of thermodynamic relations is expected in the relativistic case , this is an important question since the birth of relativity theory ( see the problem of temperature of moving bodies e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , in the non - relativistic theory this question is rarely treated ( but see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the galilean - covariance of thermodynamical relations is not evident .",
    "therefore it is not clear whether the gibbs relation is independent of reference frames or not .",
    "one may expect also that dissipation is absolute , can not depend on the motion of an external observer .",
    "_ natural philosophy .",
    "_ finally we emphasize that space - time formulation of a theory reorganizes our attitude to some fundamental concepts . in the framework of the galilean relativistic space - time model reference frames , including inertial reference frames , are secondary , derived concepts .",
    "they are not fundamental , moreover should be avoided in case of general problems , contrary to the common belief @xcite .    in the following we give a reference frame independent theory of single component dissipative galilean - relativistic fluids starting with the absolute basic fields , their balances , the thermodynamic relations and finally calculating the entropy production . along the absolute treatment the usual relative formulas and the corresponding transformation rules are calculated , together with the conditions that lead to the relative continuity ",
    "navier - stokes  fourier system of equations .    in this work a particular version of abstract indexes of penrose @xcite",
    "is introduced , that hopefully contributes to the transparency of the reference frame free meaning of the equations of galilean relativistic fluid mechanics .",
    "we introduce three different indexes .",
    "the four - vectors and tensors of the galilean relativistic space - time are denoted by upper @xmath1 indexes , the covectors and cotensors by lower @xmath1 indexes .",
    "overlined indexes from the beginning of the alphabet , @xmath2 , denote spacelike four - vectors or spacelike parts of four - tensors , when positioned upper and spacelike four - covectors or four - cotensor components when positioned lower .",
    "it is important that the upper or lower position of the @xmath1 indexes is fixed , they can not be pulled or pushed up or down , there is no canonical , observer independent identification between vectors and covectors . on the the hand",
    "the position of spacelike @xmath3 indexes can be changed , because of the euclidean sturcture of space vectors .",
    "the indexes of the usual relative vectors and tensors , those that are related either to the fluid or the external reference frame are denoted distinctively by @xmath4 .",
    "these indexes are used whenever a single relative vector ( typically the relative velocity ) is present in the formula .",
    "the space - time model , the calculation rules and the notation are explained in the appendices .",
    "the following sections require the detailed knowledge of appendix a , where the foundations of the galilean - relativistic space - time model are given and also of appendix b , where the most important calculation rules are derived and summarized .",
    "the fundamental balances of special relativistic fluids are expressed by four - divergences of the four - densities of the extensive physical quantities . in nonrelativistic physics these four - densities and four divergences",
    "are hidden , behind the usual relative formulation : the change of the extensive quantity is due to the local and simultaneous change inside the considered spatial region ( timelike part ) and the outward or inward flow ( spacelike part ) . in the following",
    "we derive the usual relative forms of the balances in a galilean relativistic framework .",
    "therefore , we express the four - vector field @xmath5 with the help of its relative parts due to the four - velocity field of the fluid @xmath6 , introducing its @xmath7-form , @xmath8 , into the balance where @xmath9 is a space - time index and @xmath10 is the spacelike index . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the timelike and @xmath7-spacelike parts of @xmath5 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath7-timelike and spacelike parts of space - time derivation @xmath15 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the absolute balance , is expressed by the @xmath7-relative parts of the four - vector @xmath5 and four - covector @xmath15 .    a relative velocity field plays a central role in the local and substantial relative balances of a fluid .",
    "this velocity is the relative velocity of the fluid and an inertial observer , therefore it is the difference of the four - velocity of the fluid , @xmath6 , and the constant four - velocity field of an inertial external observer , @xmath16 .",
    "the _ local _ form of the balance is obtained with the @xmath17-form of the derivative and the four - vector field of the physical quantity :    the _ substantial _ form of the balance is obtained by substituting the four - velocity of the fluid , @xmath6 , with the relative velocity of the fluid to the observer , @xmath18 : because @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the local balances the time derivative is denoted as @xmath21 , in the substantial ones one may use a different notation , @xmath22 , or the traditional dot , therefore @xmath23 .    in the following",
    "we apply a distinct notation , the indexes @xmath24 , for spacelike relative vectors and covectors , in formulas related to an external observer .",
    "both the local and the substantial balances and can be written this way .",
    "the relative form of the local balance is and the substantial follows as it is easy to check that local balances can be obtained from substantial ones and vice versa with the galilean transformation rules of covectors and vectors @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the substantial and local forms of the absolute balance depend on the components of the four - derivative and the four - vector splitted by the four - velocities of the fluid , @xmath6 , and the external observer , @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to remember , that the velocity field of the observer is given , the velocity field of the fluid is to be determined , we are looking for differential equations to determine it .",
    "the absolute equations are independent of _ any _ observer @xcite",
    ".    the fundamental physical information is given by the four - vector @xmath5 , its four - divergence , and by the velocity field of the medium , @xmath6 .",
    "up to now , we did not say anything about the physical meaning of the four - velocity field of the medium .",
    "we will see , that the interpretation of the four - velocity field of the fluid requires thermodynamic considerations .",
    "however , first of all we should find the space - time representation of the physical quantities like mass , momentum , energy , heat flux , etc .. we will see , that actually we don not have several quantities , in galilean relativity there is one , single , absolute physical quantity that characterizes a single component fluid .      in special relativistic fluid mechanics the physical quantities may be scalars , four - vectors and also higher order objects , like the second order energy - momentum tensor . it is straightforward to assume that in galilean relativistic space - time an analogous quantity exists like mass - momentum or energy - momentum .",
    "however , galilean relativistic space - time is a more restricted framework than the special relativistic one , because the space - time vectors and covectors are related only by the linear structure , there is no euclidean or pseudo - euclidean structure on the space - time level which would admit their identification .",
    "therefore , the divergence of a four - covector or four - cotensor field does not exist independently of a reference frame .",
    "similarly , there are no symmetric or antisymmetric parts of mixed four - tensors independently of reference frames .",
    "on the other hand , the observed empirical , space - time related properties of relative physical quantities are reflected in their transformation properties . in case of a reference and flow - frame independent galilean relativistic theory these transformation properties",
    "can be deduced , they are consequences of the properties of space - time quantities .",
    "this theoretical framework must be harmonized with the empirical knowledge .",
    "for example , if the galilean transformation rule of a physical quantity is like the transformation rule of the position , then this quantity maybe a spacelike part of a four vector . in this identification process",
    "the energy plays a distinguished role .",
    "one may come to the idea , that the relation of kinetic , internal and total energies is a galilean transformation rule .",
    "the total energy is the sum of internal and kinetic energies : from the point of view of a comoving reference frame , fixed to the flow of the medium , the energy is the internal energy , but for an external , inertial observer the kinetic energy have to be added . in a continuum",
    "the relation of the total energy density @xmath28 and the density of the internal energy @xmath29 is the following : due two reference frames having relative velocity @xmath30 .",
    "these preliminary considerations outline the framework toward understanding the relation of energy density and the space - time structure . in appendix",
    "b we have calculated the transformation rules of four - vectors , four - covectors and different second order tensors .",
    "scrutinizing the derived formulas one can observe , that a quadratic relative velocity in a transformation rule requires at least second order tensors .",
    "the time - timelike component of a second order four - tensor , the space - spacelike component of a second order four - cotensor and the time - spacelike or space - timelike component of a mixed second order tensor transforms quadratically with the relative velocity .",
    "however , the existence of balance form evolution equation restrict the possible choices , e.g. a second order four - cotensor field does not have a divergence in galilean relativistic space - time , therefore can not have a balance .",
    "however , energy may be also related to higher order tensors , like the time - timelike component of a third order , @xmath31 valued mixed tensor field .",
    "a further physical requirement is the compatibility to kinetic theory of gases . in the usual nonrelativistic theory",
    "the internal energy is the trace of the second order central momentum of the one particle probability distribution function by the relative velocity @xcite .",
    "kinetic theory determines the energy in this respect , using also the ideal gas equation of state . from a space - time point of view",
    "an energy connected to the space - spacelike component of a second order four - tensor is not sufficient , because the energy balance requires energy flux , this way an additional tensorial order . in a galilean relativistic continuum theory based on a second order four - tensor ( the mass - momentum density tensor ) one must introduce an independent , vectorial energy balance for the internal energy ,",
    "therefore can not be obtained as a transformation rule @xcite .",
    "one may conclude , that in order to fulfill all these requirements , an @xmath32 valued , third order tensor field emerges .",
    "the components of the four - divergence of this quantity must give the fundamental balances of mass , momentum and energy together .",
    "in the next sections we will show that such a basic physical quantity leads to a consistent theory .",
    "astonishingly , one may obtain a rather similar theory assuming that the basic physical quantity is the above mentioned third order mixed tensor field . in both cases",
    "the transformation rules are the same and the entropy production is obtained in the same form ( after a long calculation ) .",
    "the compatibility with the usual energy concept of kinetic theory compels us to consider in this paper a third order four - tensor as the basic physical quantity of a galilean relativistic theory of single component fluids .    looking back to the relation of total , internal and kinetic energies one may wonder about expected properties of transformation rules . considering a third reference frame , it is easy to see , that the formula is not a transitive rule .",
    "our idea of an energy transformation rule is seemingly wrong .",
    "in the following we will see , that transitivity may be expected , our formula is an oversimplified version of a more complicated relation .",
    "let us consider the tensor field @xmath33 , the _ mass - momentum - energy density - flux third order four - tensor _ of a single component fluid .",
    "we assume that the tensor field is symmetric in the second and third order , as it is indicated by the symbol @xmath34 . in the following",
    "we do not explicitly denote this symmetry , @xmath35 , only we refer to it if necessary .",
    "this tensor can be written in the following general @xmath7-form , with the components obtained by the four - velocity @xmath6 : where these components are the second order four - tensor of densities and the tensor of fluxes or current densities , that is @xmath36 is the _ mass - momentum - energy density tensor _ and @xmath37 is the _ diffusion - pressure - heat flux _",
    "@xmath38 is the time evaluation and @xmath39 is the @xmath7-projection for taking the @xmath7-spacelike parts of vectors .",
    "the further notations are :    * @xmath40 is the time - time - timelike part of the mass - momentum - energy density - flux tensor , the _ mass density _ or _",
    "density_. * @xmath41 is the time - time - spacelike part of the mass - momentum - energy density - flux tensor , the _ momentum density_. because of the symmetry of @xmath42 it is equal to the time - space - timelike part , @xmath43 .",
    "* @xmath44 is the _ energy density tensor _ , the time - space - spacelike part of @xmath42 .",
    "* @xmath45 is the _",
    "( self)diffusion flux _ , the space - time - timelike part of @xmath42 .",
    "* @xmath46 is the _ pressure _ , the space - time - spacelike part of @xmath42 . because of the symmetry of the third order tensor it is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "* @xmath48 is the _ heat flux tensor _ , the space - space - spacelike part of @xmath42 .",
    "the usual energy density and heat flux can be introduced according to the kinetic theory reducing the order of the corresponding tensors by two :    * @xmath49 is the _ energy density _ , * @xmath50 is the _ heat flux_.",
    "all these quantities are defined with the help of the velocity field of the medium , @xmath6 .",
    "so they are independent of any external observers .      the time- and spacelike components of a physical quantity obtained by an inertial observer of constant four - velocity @xmath27 are relative quantities .",
    "the galilean transformation rule of a physical quantity means expressing these relative quantities with the aid of the components corresponding to the four velocity @xmath6 . in appendix",
    "b the transformation rules of first and second order tensors are calculated by splitting the @xmath7-form of the tensors with the four - velocity @xmath27 .",
    "the same procedure can be applied for the third order mass - momentum - energy density - flux tensor . in transformation formulas",
    "the relative velocity of the fluid to the observer , @xmath51 , appears naturally .",
    "the ( mass)density , @xmath52 , is a galilean - scalar , it is invariant :    the momentum density and the mass density are components of an absolute four - vector , therefore the momentum density transforms like the spatial component of a four - vector :    the ( self)diffusion flux transform like the momentum density , because together with mass density they are components of a four - vector , too :    the energy density is not a galilean - scalar :    the transformation rule of the pressure tensor is : the most complicated transformation rule belongs to the heat flux :    finally , we summarize these rules with the help of the usual 3-index notation :    two unusual quantities appeared in our reference frame free approach .",
    "one of them is the conductive current density of the mass , @xmath53 , the ( self)diffusion flux .",
    "the other one is the momentum density , @xmath54 .",
    "one can reveal their role with the help of the absolute and relative balances of the fluid .",
    "the balances of mass , momentum and energy are the components derived from the divergence of the mass - momentum - energy density - flux tensor .",
    "the @xmath7-form of the divergence is :    here the dot denotes the @xmath7-time derivative : @xmath55 .",
    "the timelike part of the mass - momentum - energy balance is the mass - momentum balance :    the timelike part of the mass - momentum balance ( the time - timelike part of the mass - momentum - energy balance ) is the mass balance : the @xmath7-spacelike part of is the momentum balance :    the balance of energy is the @xmath7-space - spacelike part of the mass - momentum - energy balance , more properly the trace of that :    one may obtain the substantial form of the balances , and by using the relative velocity @xmath51 of the fluid to the inertial reference frame . with the usual three - index notation they are",
    "these are the mass , momentum and energy balances of the fluid .",
    "the same expressions are obtained if the transformation rules are applied to exchange the inertial reference frame related @xmath17-quantities with medium related @xmath7-quantities in the local balances .",
    "the underlined terms indicate the differences between the usual balances of fluids ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the ones above . in these terms",
    "two additional quantities appear , the ( self)diffusion flux , @xmath56 , and the momentum density @xmath57 . therefore the usual closure procedure , prescribing constitutive functions for the pressure tensor , @xmath58 , and the heat flux , @xmath59 , is insufficient , further conditions are necessary to close the system of equations . to this end",
    "one should investigate the thermodynamics of fluids from the point of view of galilean relativistic space - time .",
    "the title of the section reflects the paradoxical dilemma of thermodynamics ( or thermostatics ? ) considering the motion related mechanical properties .",
    "the literature of thermodynamics rarely introduces velocity as a state variable . in rational continuum mechanical investigations this possibility is forbidden , because the usual theory does not consider classical thermodynamics as a meaningful starting point- moreover , according to the usual formulation of the principle of material frame indifference relative velocity can not be a variable in constitutive functions ( see e.g. @xcite p43 ) . from the point of view of galilean relativity",
    "these statements require further analysis @xcite .",
    "our fundamental point of view is , that classical `` equilibrium '' thermodynamics is actually time dependent : it is the homogeneous , discrete counterpart of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , the thermodynamic relations of relativistic kinetic theory can be instructive .",
    "the essential aspects are treated in @xcite .",
    "the entropy density is a four - vector field , whose @xmath7-form is @xmath60 , with the timelike component , the entropy density , @xmath61 and the @xmath7-spacelike component , the entropy flux @xmath62 .",
    "the entropy density is the function of the mass - momentum - energy density : @xmath63 .",
    "this is an absolute relation , does not depend neither on a reference frame nor on the velocity field of the medium @xmath6 , because both the entropy density and the density tensor of the extensives , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are absolute .",
    "the derivative of @xmath64 is the symmetric second order four - cotensor of the thermodynamic intensives , the _ chemical potential - thermovelocity - temperature four - cotensor _ , and denoted by @xmath66 in the following .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 this derivative is the _ gibbs relation _ and in the following it is treated by differentials according to thermodynamic tradition :    the @xmath7-form of the chemical potential - thermovelocity - temperature cotensor is :    if the tensor @xmath36 is split to components according to , then    * @xmath68 is the intensive quantity related to the mass density , * @xmath69 is the intensive quantity belonging to the momentum density @xmath70 , * @xmath71 is the intensive quantity related to the energy density tensor @xmath72 .",
    "one can pull closer the treatment to the usual approach assuming    in this case    then the physical quantities are    * the _ reciprocal temperature _ , @xmath73 : * the _ chemical potential _",
    "@xmath74 is related to the entropic intensive of the mass density : * finally ,",
    "_ thermovelocity _",
    "is defined with the help of the momentum density related intensive    therefore the @xmath7-form of the absolute gibbs relation can be calculated as :    with the help of the @xmath7-split quantities finally the following form is obtained :    this formula is analogous to the relativistic gibbs relation suggested in @xcite , where the compatibility with kinetic theory is considered .",
    "the enthalpy in the relativistic case is substituted by the mass density here .",
    "the legendre transformation of the entropy density four - vector defines the _ conjugated entropy _ ,",
    "@xmath75 : let us give the @xmath7-form of the conjugated entropy in the following form where @xmath76 .",
    "then the absolute timelike part of the four - vector equation , the _ extensivity relation _ is this expression defines the thermostatodynamic ( thermostatic ) _ pressure _ , @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath7-spacelike part , the entropy flux , is obtained with the help of the @xmath7-projection , @xmath78 : the extensivity relation , and the gibb relation together result in the _ gibbs  duhem relation _ : where @xmath79 is the enthalpy density .",
    "the @xmath7-form of the absolute gibbs relation , may be interpreted by taking into account that the relative intensives @xmath80 are functions of the relative densities @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , one of the second order mixed partial derivatives of the internal energy @xmath82 leads to the following maxwell - relation : this is a partial differential equation for @xmath83 , whose general solution is where @xmath84 and the four velocity @xmath85 are arbitrary functions of @xmath52 and @xmath64 .",
    "the above equation of state demonstrates , that the dependence of the thermovelocity on the momentum density @xmath54 is restricted .",
    "the equation of state is very simple if @xmath86 . in this case in the following we will call this relation _",
    "momentum condition_.      the entropy density and the entropy flux are time- and spacelike components of the entropy four - vector . the components according to an external inertial observer with constant @xmath27 four - velocity lead to the corresponding transformation rules between the comoving reference frame to an inertial laboratory one : here @xmath51 is the relative velocity field",
    ".    the general transformation rules of four - vectors in and the representation of @xmath75 in result in    the components of the absolute chemical potential - thermovelocity - temperature four - cotensor , @xmath87 , are transformed acording to of appendix b :    it is worth to analyze thermovelocity with more details .",

    "an example of more complicated choices is mixture of energy- and particle(mass)-flow @xcite .",
    "the different choices are not equivalent from a practical point of view . looking at the above expression of the entropy production one may recognize , that a simple form of constitutive functions is obtained fixing the four velocity of the fluid to the thermovelocity , that is @xmath104 . this flow - frame is called _ thermo - flow_.    the entropy production with thermo - flow is the following :    if the momentum condition equation of state , , is applied , then @xmath105 is the consequence of @xmath106 .",

    "at the other hand , we can say with the transformations terminology that the relativ velocity @xmath30 for observer @xmath17 is transformed to zero when we change to observer @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to the dash is used only for the timelike part , because of the accustomed notation of the relative velocity ( @xmath30 would be @xmath240 ) .    in the above formulas of galilean transformations",
    "there are two _ arbitrary _ velocity fields , the formulas are not related solely to inertial observers . only the galilean invariant quantities are considered observer independent , however not only those , but a combination of properly transformed quantities may be absolute , whenever it is a component of an absolute space - time quantity . the timelike part of and absolute four - vector physical quantity ( the density of an extensive quantity ) is galilean invariant , its spacelike part ( the current density or flux ) transforms , therefore it depends on the reference frame .",
    "however , the complete four - vector is absolute .",
    "the same is valid also for the velocity , where the four - velocity is absolute , notwithstanding that the timelike part seemingly does not contain physical information . putting a physical theory in the space - time model",
    "one can consistently decide what depends on the reference frame and what does not .",
    "we have seen , that , the time- and spacelike parts of the covector @xmath184 by the velocity @xmath6 are @xmath241 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "these componets are represented by lower indexes and horizontal mode of writing : @xmath242 according to the previous section the transformation rules of the parts of @xmath184 is obtained by splitting the @xmath7-form of @xmath184 using the velocity field @xmath27 . for the timelike part it is where identity was applied . for",
    "the spacelike part one should use the identities : the complete transformation rule may be written with in the 1 + 3 dimensional form :    a particular example is the space - time differentiation @xmath15 , which is a symbolic covector .",
    "then we obtain , that : if @xmath6 is the velocity field of a fluid , and @xmath27 is that of an observer , the @xmath243 is the _ substantial time derivative _ , @xmath30 is the relative velocity of an observer , related to the fluid and @xmath244 .",
    "the relation between the _ partial time derivative _ @xmath245 , and the substantial time derivative @xmath246 is @xmath247 .",
    "it is worth to compare the previous transformation rule based derivation and the usual method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an observer @xmath6 splits a second order tensor , @xmath196 , into a time - timelike part , @xmath195 , into a time - spacelike part @xmath248 , into a space - timelike part , @xmath249 , and into a space - spacelike part , @xmath250 .",
    "therefore @xmath251 in general @xmath252 and also @xmath253 , because the symmetry of @xmath196 was not assumed .",
    "the corresponding transformation rules are calculated as follows .",
    "the time - timelike component is invariant the transformation rule of the time - spacelike and space - timelike components is like the transformation rule of a space vector : for the space - spacelike component one obtains a more complicated formula : here we have used .",
    "the complete transformation rule can be written also with the usual notation :      the components of a second order mixed tensor @xmath207 by an observer @xmath6 observer are @xmath254 , the time - timelike , @xmath255 , the space - timelike , @xmath256 the time - spacelike and @xmath257 the space - spacelike components .",
    "that is @xmath258 it is meaningless to speak about the symmetry of mixed second order tensors .",
    "only , eventually , the observer dependent split can be symmetric .",
    "this is also clear from the galilean transformation rules , because the time - spacelike and space - timelike parts transform differently .",
    "we obtain for the time - timelike component : the time - spacelike component seems to be a three - vector , but does not transform .",
    "this can be understood using the identities : the galilean transformation rule for the space - timelike component is : finally for the space - spacelike part one derives here the usual identities were used . then the complete transformation rule can be written as :      the components of the second order cotensor @xmath215 split by the observer @xmath6 are the @xmath259 time - timelike , @xmath260 space - timelike , @xmath261 time - spacelike and the @xmath262 space - spacelike parts . that can be written in a matrix form as @xmath263 if @xmath215 is not",
    "symmetric , @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "the calculation of the transformation rules of the components is the following .",
    "for the time - timelike part one obtains : the time - spacelike part transforms identically with the space - timelike part : the space - spacelike part is galilean invariant here the usual identities were applied , too .",
    "finally the complete transformation rule is given in a matrix form :",
    "this work is based on the fundamental ideas of tams matolcsi who condensed space - times into mathematical models .",
    "the author is also indebted to tams flp , who was convinced all the time that there is an absolute nonrelativistic energy . in this work",
    "it does not look like a cotensor , but that possibility is not excluded yet .",
