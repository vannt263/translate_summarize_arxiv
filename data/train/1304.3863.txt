    "measurement of solar magnetic - fields has been a goal of solar physics since the discovery of the zeeman effect in sunspots by @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to review how magnetic - dipole ( m1 ) lines , formed in coronal plasma , might be used to address particular questions in coronal and heliospheric physics : how does the coronal magnetic - field vector evolve over the solar sunspot cycle ?",
    "can we measure some of the free magnetic energy on observable scales in the corona , and its changes , say , before and after a flare ?",
    "theoretical work by @xcite spurred experimental studies of the polarization of magnetic - dipole lines , such as [ fe  xiii ] @xmath0 at 1074.7 nm , as a way to constrain coronal magnetic - fields .",
    "the lines are optically thin in the corona ; their intensities are @xmath1 of the disk continuum intensities .",
    "thus they can be observed only during eclipses or using coronagraphs that occult the solar disk .    here ,",
    "we review m1 emission - line polarization towards the specific goal of _ measuring the vector magnetic - field @xmath2 $ ] throughout a sub - volume of the corona_. to date , this has not been achieved .",
    "we have little idea of the true origin of cmes , flares , and coronal heating . even though coronal plasma has been regularly observed since the 1930s .",
    "the latest of several decades of high - cadence images of coronal plasma from space reveal more details but are limited to studying effects , not causes , of coronal dynamics , since such instruments measure thermal , not magnetic , properties . to discover the _ cause _ of coronal dynamics we",
    "_ must measure _",
    "@xmath3 _ above the photosphere- the region of the atmosphere where free energy is stored and quickly released _ , since it is the free energy associated with electrical current systems within coronal plasmas that drives these phenomena .",
    "measurements of @xmath3 in the photosphere have been done for decades , but photospheric dynamics occurs under mixed @xmath4 conditions ( @xmath5 gas / magnetic pressure @xmath6 ) .",
    "in contrast , the low-@xmath4 coronal plasma should exist in simpler magnetic configurations , perhaps more amenable to straightforward interpretation . in mhd",
    "the electrical currents are simply @xmath7 . given sufficiently accurate measurements of @xmath8 in the low-@xmath4 corona ,",
    "both @xmath9 and the free energy itself can in principle be derived .",
    "like all observational studies , this is bandwidth - limited exercise .",
    "we can investigate structures only from the smallest resolvable scales @xmath10 to the largest @xmath11 mm , and on time scales longer than the smallest time @xmath12 needed to acquire the data .",
    "the spatial range will be limited by forseeable observational capabilities to @xmath13 mm .",
    "successful tomographic - inversions using solar rotation to slice through the 3d corona require @xmath14 day , during which the corona is viewed from angles differing by @xmath15 radian . given our goal ,",
    "it is clear that we will not be able to investigate either the dissipation scales of magnetic - fields , nor changes in magnetic - fields on rapid dynamical time scales @xmath16s of the inner corona ( here @xmath17 mm s@xmath18 is the alfvn speed ) .",
    "however , these limitations are not new . in any case",
    "coronal dynamics and flares involve a slow build - up and sudden release of magnetic free energy @xcite .",
    "this energy build - up can indeed , and should be , explored through new measurements of @xmath8 .",
    "consider a heliocentric coordinate system with sun center at @xmath19 , with the line of sight along @xmath20 , and @xmath21 being in the plane of the sky . given a set of observations @xmath22 $ ] of the four stokes parameters [ @xmath23 at @xmath24 frequencies @xmath25 $ ] across a m1 line at time @xmath26 , we seek solutions for @xmath27 over an observable sub - volume of the corona @xmath28 .",
    "we can write @xmath29 the m1 lines  having small oscillator strengths  are optically thin through the corona . under these conditions @xmath30 is a non - linear , but _ local _ function of a `` source vector '' @xmath31 .",
    "the price for `` optical thinness '' is that @xmath32 encompasses the entire line of sight through the corona to the solar disk or into space .",
    "tomography specifically takes advantage of this .",
    "there is , however , skepticism in the community concerning the magnetic - field measurements under optically thin conditions that we address in section s : los .",
    "the non - linearity arises because the stokes parameters @xmath33 depend on the `` atomic alignment '' [ @xmath34 , a scalar quantity that is a linear combination of magnetic - substate populations .",
    "the alignment can be positive , negative , or zero , as discussed below .",
    "ignoring the alignment would make the problem linear in the source term ( like the standard emission measure problem for line intensities only ) .",
    "the source [ @xmath35 must be written as a function of @xmath36 and time [ @xmath26 ] in terms of necessary thermodynamic and magnetic parameters . at a minimum",
    "this means specifying @xmath38 for plasma with density @xmath39 moving with velocity @xmath40 at temperature @xmath41 .",
    "these quantities must be supplemented by calculations that give the local distributions of ionization states and electron density .",
    "any formal `` inverse '' solution is of the form @xmath42 where @xmath33 is the @xmath43-long `` vector '' of observed stokes parameters .",
    "clearly , a 3d array of scalar and vector - fields such as @xmath44 can not be recovered from one set of measurements [ @xmath45 that are integrated over @xmath32 .",
    "additional information is needed .    a `` good diagnostic '' maps components of @xmath33 into @xmath46 .",

    "* ) @xmath47 the eigen - spectrum of matrix @xmath48 measures the degree to which measurements of @xmath33 can be used to determine @xmath46 . as usual , the formal operation given by equation ( eq : cb ) should not be taken as an inverse solution , it is ill - posed @xcite .",
    "polarization of spectral lines is generated in two ways ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "any process that produces unequal sub - level populations , such as anisotropy of illuminating radiation , also produces polarization of light in the emitted radiative transitions to / from a given atomic level .",
    "when magnetic - substate populations are equal , the state is `` naturally populated '' and light is unpolarized .",
    "the second way is to separate the substates in energy , so that spectroscopy can discriminate states of polarized light associated with the specific changes in energy of states with different sub - level quantum numbers @xmath49 $ ] , no matter how the sub - levels are populated .",
    "magnetic- and electric- fields thus are imprinted on spectral line polarization through the zeeman and stark effects .",
    "since charge neutrality is a good approximation in coronal plasma ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , electric - fields and the associated stresses are far smaller than those for the magnetic - field , and in quasi - static situations can be ignored .",
    "we focus on the magnetic - fields .    adopting the notation of @xcite , for m1 emission - lines between upper- and lower - levels with quantum numbers @xmath50 ( @xmath51 total angular momentum ) and @xmath52 , the @xmath30 terms in equation ( eq : forward )",
    "are proportional to a term of the form @xmath53 this term is simply the emission coefficient ( ignoring stimulated emission ) for the _ unpolarized _ transfer problem , in units of erg  @xmath54  sr@xmath18  s@xmath18 .",
    "the population density of the upper - level can be factored as usual as    @xmath55    we label the first factor on the rhs of the above equation @xmath56 , it is the ratio of the upper - level population of the level emitting the photons to the total ion population .",
    "the remaining factors are , in order , the ionization fraction , element abundance , ratio of hydrogen nuclei number density to the electron number density @xmath57 , and lastly @xmath57 itself . for strong lines ( electric dipole or `` e1 '' lines in the euv/ soft x rays ) @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 as usual . for m1 lines",

    "this factor is a function only of temperature @xmath41 .",
    "the polarized terms [ @xmath30 ] also depend on the anisotropy of the incident photospheric radiation , particle collisions , the strength and direction of the coronal magnetic - field , and the direction of the line of sight .",

    "thus far they have investigated the minimization of the functional @xmath107 where the integral is over the coronal volume .",
    "minimization of @xmath108 simply forces the selection of a 3d magnetic - field to minimize the differences between observed @xmath109 and computed @xmath110 intensities and polarized stokes parameters , subject to the additional constraint depending on @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath111 is a parameter that determines how much of the solution is determined by the data ( @xmath111 large ) and by the physically imposed divergence constraint ( @xmath111 small ) .",
    "( note that @xmath111 should include the estimates of the observed uncertainties for each component of the vector of observables too ) .",
    "the divergence constraint alone means that the space of curl - free vector - fields is a null space : potential field components along the los are invisible to stokes-@xmath112 .",
    "they speculate that by adding the force - free constraint into the regularization ( as @xmath113 ) , this null space might be eliminated .",
    "it should be remembered that such inversions rely on stereoscopic observations of coronal m1 lines ( not currently possible ) or on the assumption that the corona is a solidly rotating body , observed from the earth over periods of at least a day .",
    "if we combine our understanding from section sec : inversion with tomography , we see that with a general forward modeling code such as that written by @xcite , we can in principle invert a vector of observations including m1 lines with large and small alignment factors and selected e1 lines , to obtain the desired solutions for @xmath3 .",
    "key to this effort will be the regular detection of the stokes-@xmath100 parameters of m1 lines , something that has not yet been achieved owing to the small apertures of coronagraphs currently used .",
    "unpublished work by judge using the prototype comp instrument ( @xmath114 cm ) acquired in february 2012 gives an upper limit of 0.15% for the maximum ratio of @xmath115 in 1079.8 nm . in 70 minute integrations and a low ( 20@xmath116 ) spatial resolution ,",
    "@xcite achieved a sensitivity below 0.01% , leading to a stokes-@xmath100 amplitude over an active region of about @xmath117 , with a 0.46 m diameter coronagraph .",
    "clearly , bigger telescopes are needed at excellent sites for this kind of work to succeed .",
    "the coronal solar magnetism observatory [ cosmo ] offers one possible solution .",
    "the tomographic - inversion scheme outlined above is the only way to invert formally data vectors to recover the coronal @xmath3 .",
    "the scheme relies on solar rotation and assuming the coronal structures are stationary over periods of a day or longer , or on the future availability of stereoscopic measurements both from earth and from a spacecraft ( like the solar terrestrial relations observatory [ stereo ] ) at a significant elongation from the earth .",
    "the latter possibility has yet to be discussed at all and so is decades away .",
    "the former is naturally limited , but should be pursued once regular observations of the weak stokes-@xmath100 signal are available .",
    "the comp instrument is a prototype for larger instruments which should achieve this goal ( _ e.g. _ , the advanced technology solar telescope [ atst ] , cosmo ) .",
    "it seems prudent also to relax our goal of reconstructing @xmath3 via tomography and look to other ways that we might make progress in this area .",
    "one possibility is to assume that we can identify a single plasma loop in an m1 transition , as routinely done for euv or x - ray data . in such a case",
    "the source vector [ @xmath35 only has contributions predominantly from lines of sight that intersect the loop .",
    "also let us assume that observations from another viewpoint ( euv data from stereo for example ) are available that fix the heliocentric coordinates of the plasma loop .",
    "this additional information enables us to diagnose magnetic - fields beyond what is possible from an isolated measurement of the stokes profiles of a single point @xcite .",
    "however , as for euv lines , no useful information outside the plasma loop volume is available .",
    "nevertheless this should be pursued .",
    "another avenue to explore adding information to the data is to assume that we know more about the current - carrying structures that we are looking for .",
    "thus , by building synthetic maps of m1 lines from models of the magnetic field and coronal plasma , and comparing them directly with observations , one can hope to extract meaningful information .",
    "it may be possible to argue that the data are inconsistent with a class of model ( `` i '' ) , whereas another class ( `` ni '' ) is not inconsistent .",
    "science advances often by identifying models of class ( i ) , those of class ( ni ) being acceptable subject to further investigation .",
    "this will be a fruitful approach ; already some initial comparisons reveal models of type ( ni ) ( @xcite , in this volume ) but as of yet we are not aware interesting cases in class ( i ) .",
    "there are obvious cases where potential fields , extrapolated from the lower atmosphere fall into class ( i ) , but this finding serves merely to show that some free magnetic energy appears necessary to describe coronal structures .",
    "this is something we have known for decades through other arguments ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "these are early days though .",
    "the main issue with this approach is that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than are dreamt of in your philosophy . _",

    "apparently the los issues do not present special challenges in these analyses of coronal - intensity measurements .",
    "one might argue that these are seen against the dark solar disk ( any euv continuum emission from the low temperature photosphere / low chromosphere is very dark ) , whereas the m1 coronal lines must be observed above the limb against a dark background .",
    "but even in this case , isolated bright plasma loops organized into an active region offer no greater path lengths for integration than observations on the disk . indeed ,",
    "the discovery of mhd wave modes in the m1 fe  xiii 1074.7 nm line @xcite indicates that , just as for euv work , line of sight confusion is not an overwhelming problem .",
    "we conclude that , _ as in all remotely sensed magnetic data _ , line of sight issues are important but not intractable",
    ". often , using m1 lines we will be interested in the coronal magnetic - fields above active regions .",
    "these present themselves as bright isolated plasma loops in m1 coronal lines just as the euv and x ray lines do @xcite , dominating the contributions to the stokes vectors along the line of sight .",
    "scientific skepticism is healthy , and we certainly need to be skeptical of interpretations of all remotely sensed data of an object like the sun . we have shown that the optically thin forbidden coronal lines suffer from the same kinds of interpretational problems as do other diagnostics of solar magnetism .",
    "we have suggested several ways to augment the data of isolated points in the corona - for which we have vast null spaces of unexplorable parameters - using tomography and traditional ideas concerning the smoothness and continuity of magnetic - fields in coronal structures , applied universally to euv and x - ray intensity data .",
    "it will be interesting to see how a full vector inversion including lines sensitive to thermodynamic parameters  both visible / ir m1 lines and euv lines  will serve to further constrain tomographic - inversions .",
    "certain schemes ( especially `` direct [ matrix ] inversions '' ) can be very fast , but these require linear equations which is manifestly not the case ( see the equations above ) .",
    "it is , however , possible that the non - linearities introduced by the alignment into these equations can be treated to some degree by a formal ( newton - raphson- style ) linearization scheme .",
    "this seems promising given that we have lines with quite different alignment factors ( 1074.7 vs. 1079.8 or 798.2 nm ) and thus different non - linear amplitudes , but this is an area that remains to be explored .",
    "several ways forward are reviewed while we await the arrival of high - sensitivity ( @xmath118 ) polarization data from telescopes ( atst , cosmo ) needed for tomographic inversions that can recover the vector - field throughout volumes of the corona .",
