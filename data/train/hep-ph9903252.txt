    "neutrino oscillations were reported last year by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite to have been convincingly seen by the super - kamiokande detector in kamioka , japan , in the study of the atmospheric neutrino problem .",
    "this has rekindled interest to explain also other deviations from expected results in neutrino physics in terms of neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are at present essentially four different types of experiments looking for neutrino oscillations : solar neutrino experiments , atmospheric neutrino experiments , accelerator neutrino experiments , and reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "most analyses of neutrino data so far have been performed in two - flavor models .",
    "although this is quite illustrative , it can lead to wrong conclusions concerning the necessary number of degrees of freedom to explain data .",
    "it is , e.g. , possible that the four neutrino scenario , advocated by several authors , is an artifact of this simplification .",
    "recently , several papers @xcite have been published pertaining at demonstrating the possibility to obtain an overall description in terms of a three - flavor model . most of these investigations have focused on demonstrating the plausibility of the scenario , without truly fitting all the data .    here",
    "we would like to report on the first stage of a global analysis of all the neutrino oscillation data in a three - flavor model .",
    "we will assume that @xmath5 nonconservation is negligible at the present level of experimental accuracy .",
    "thus , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix for the neutrinos is real .",
    "there are then in principle five parameters that can be fitted in this model : three mixing angles and two mass squared differences .",
    "( this is in contrast with two two - flavor models , which give only four parameters : two mixing angles and two mass squared differences . )",
    "the two mass squared differences in the three - flavor model enter the argument of the sinodial function in combination with the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the source - detector distance and @xmath8 is the neutrino energy .",
    "the argument of the sinodial functions related to the energy dependence can then be treated as yet another angle . in this case , the probability function can be seen as given by a rotation of the flavor states by five angles .",
    "this is in analogy to the two - flavor case , which can be seen as a rotation by two angles , one of which is given by @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the mass squared difference of the two neutrino masses .    in the present analysis",
    ", we will make the simplifying assumption that the relevant ranges of mass squared differences are such that the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite in the sun is negligible .",
    "this excludes essentially the sensitivity region @xmath11@xmath12 ev@xmath13 .",
    "the absence of any day - night variation in the super - kamiokande and kamiokande data is also consistent with neglecting the msw resonance effect in the earth for the electron - neutrino data .",
    "the differing results for the solar neutrino experiments present another problem . since the super - kamiokande and kamiokande experiments can resolve the energy for the solar neutrinos , these experiments are of a rather different and more detailed kind than the radio - chemical experiments .",
    "it is possible to vary the disappearance rate by going to a mass squared realm , where the arguments , i.e. , the angles that depend on the mass squared differences , are sensitive to the energy of the neutrinos , since this is different for the different detection methods .",
    "however , in this case , the energy domains for the different experiments do not vary in the way expected , making the cl experiment the smallest ( @xmath14 ) and the ga experiments the largest ( @xmath15 ) of the expected rate .",
    "one would , in fact , expect the super - kamiokande experiment , with the highest mean energy for the neutrinos , to give the smallest result , whereas in reality it is in between .    confronting this with the apparent lack of variation in the experimental solar neutrino detection probability with energy , at least up to approximately 13 mev , in the super - kamiokande data",
    ", we will adopt the point of view that the mass squared differences are in a range that leads to the solar neutrino oscillations being averaged out to their classical values . by fitting the three mixing angles",
    ", we then account for the weighted mean of all the solar neutrino experiments . by nature of the sensitivity level of the accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments",
    ", we will choose the mass squared difference ranges as @xmath16 and @xmath17 ev@xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath18 will regulate the accelerator experiments and the multi - gev atmospheric neutrino data , whereas @xmath10 regulates the low energy atmospheric experiments .",
    "this choice is thus not inherited from two - flavor model analyses , but arises from the sensitivity of the different types of experiments .",
    "it is in principle possible that there would be a resonance effect for the atmospheric electron - neutrinos passing through earth .",
    "our chosen ranges for the mass squared differences exclude this effect in the present fit , since @xmath19 ev@xmath13 .    since the reactor experiments are disappearance experiments with no signal seen , they can at best exclude certain ranges for the mass squared differences due to their sensitivity level .",
    "the two ranges of mass squared differences chosen here respect this sensitivity level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] , we briefly discuss the formalism used in our analysis including notations , gaussian averaging , and minimization . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cod ] , we discuss the choice of data from different experiments used in the minimization procedure .",
    "[ sec : na ] describes the minimization procedure and includes the results thereof .",
    "we also show that our results are consistent with the experimental data , assuming that all of the deviations from the expected values are indeed related to the physics of neutrino oscillations .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : dc ] presents a discussion of the results and also our main conclusions .",
    "in the present analysis , we will use the plane - wave approximation to describe neutrino oscillations . in this approximation ,",
    "a neutrino state @xmath20 with flavor @xmath21 is a linear combination of neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath22 such that @xmath23 where the @xmath24 s are entries in a unitary @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 a convenient parametrization for @xmath26 is @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "this is the so called standard representation of the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "we have here put the @xmath5 phase equal to zero in the ckm matrix .",
    "this means that @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the probability of transition from a neutrino flavor state @xmath21 to a neutrino flavor state @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is kronecker s delta and @xmath38 .",
    "the three mass squared differences @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are not linearly independent , since they satisfy the relation @xmath42 therefore , we will define @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_ab ] ) it is clear that @xmath45 and since we have assumed that @xmath5 is conserved , i.e. , the ckm mixing matrix @xmath26 is real , it holds that @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that @xmath47      since in practice the neutrino wave is neither detected nor produced with sharp energy or with well defined propagation length , we have to average over the @xmath6 dependence and other uncertainties in the detection and emission of the neutrino wave",
    ". we will here use the gaussian average , which is defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the expectation value and standard deviation , respectively .    by taking the gaussian average of eq .",

    "we minimize the following object function @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the number of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the function @xmath73 is a least square method error function for the relative errors of the neutrino oscillation experiments with weights @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the theoretical ( model ) and experimental transition probabilities for the @xmath78th experiment , respectively .",
    "the reason why we are using relative errors in the error function and not absolute errors ( as is usually done ) is due to the fact that the different categories of experiments have rather different numerical ranges for the experimental transition probabilities . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will write @xmath79 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 instead of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively , to keep the notations simpler .    in accordance with the discussion in the introduction",
    ", the following constraints will be used in the minimization procedure @xmath83 the weights in the object function  ( [ eq : obj ] ) will be chosen as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of experiments used in the minimization of the same category ( solar , atmospheric , accelerator , or reactor ) and @xmath86 is the relative error in the @xmath78th experiment .",
    "our choice for the weights is motivated by our wish to treat all categories of experiments on the same footing ( the factor @xmath87 ) , and enhance experiments with small relative errors ( the factor @xmath88 ) . here again , relative errors are used , since the range of values of the probabilities are rather different . however , in all our cases , @xmath89 .",
    "higher powers of @xmath88 would enhance the good experiments too much . since @xmath90 is a sum of the statistical and systematical errors , an underestimation of the latter will , of course , also overemphasize the relative weight of a certain experiment .",
    "for the damping factor of an experiment , we will use @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a combination of the uncertainties coming from ( a ) the length of the detector and ( b ) the distance between the detector and the neutrino source and @xmath93 is the uncertainty in the mean neutrino energy . in table",
    "[ tab : experiments ] , we have listed all the experiments , which we have used in the minimization procedure .",
    "most of the data used in our analysis are taken directly from the quoted publications .",
    "( see table  [ tab : experiments ] for the references to each experiment . )",
    "we have chosen in this first analysis not to discriminate between the various experiments in any other way than by their experimental uncertainties .",
    "for the chlorine ( cl ) and gallium ( ga ) experiments , we will define the mean neutrino energy as @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "the index @xmath96 labels the different solar neutrino sources . in the case of a cl experiment ( homestake )",
    ", @xmath96 can be _ pep _ , @xmath97be , @xmath98b , _ hep _ , @xmath99o , or @xmath100f , and similarly for a ga experiment ( sage or gallex ) , @xmath96 can be _ pp _ , _ pep _ , @xmath97be , @xmath98b , _ hep _ , @xmath101n , @xmath99o , or @xmath100f .",
    "the quantities @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the average neutrino energy and standard solar model ( ssm ) prediction for the neutrino capture rates of the solar neutrino source @xmath96 , respectively . using the values given by the bahcall - basu - pinsonneault 1998 ( bbp98 ) ssm @xcite , we obtain the mean neutrino energy to be @xmath104 for the sage and gallex experiments and @xmath105 for the homestake experiment .    as for the water - cherenkov detector experiments ( super - kamiokande and kamiokande ) , we have chosen the mean energy of the neutrinos to be @xmath106 .",
    "we will assume that the uncertainty in the energy is @xmath107 , respecting the threshold energy for detection .",
    "for the super - kamiokande and kamiokande experiments , the energy resolution is taken to be @xmath108 mev .    for solar neutrino experiments ,",
    "the path length for the neutrinos is given by the mean sun - earth distance .",
    "the length of the detector , the deviation in the earth s orbit around the sun , and the solar radius are all small in this connection , giving @xmath109 for solar neutrinos .",
    "the path length of the atmospheric neutrinos is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the so called zenith angle , @xmath112 is the radius of the earth , and @xmath113 is the altitude of the production point of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we have taken @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which gives @xmath116 for the bin mean value @xmath117 ( macro and kamiokande ) and @xmath118 for bin mean value @xmath119 ( soudan , super - kamiokande , and imb ) .",
    "the bins @xmath120 and @xmath121 have @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively",
    ".    the atmospheric neutrino experiments present a special problem , since they are not entirely comparable to each other .",
    "the super - kamiokande experiment measures several parameters and has presented the `` ratio of ratios '' integrated over the energy ( actually @xmath6 ) as does also the kamiokande experiment .",
    "other experiments can only measure the ratio of observed neutrino flux and expected neutrino flux .",
    "the double ratio eliminates most of the uncertainty in the muon - neutrino flux .",
    "however , this function is also more complicated to fit , and has lost much of the information of path length and energy of the neutrinos .",
    "we have therefore used the directly measured disappearance rates evaluated from the data for upward - going events given in the tables and figures of refs .",
    "this makes it possible to use several of the other atmospheric neutrino experiments on the same footing .",
    "the disadvantage is the uncertainty in the expected neutrino flux .",
    "this uncertainty is claimed to be of the order of @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty of the neutrino flux comes from the uncertainty in the primary cosmic radiation flux giving rise to the pions and kaons responsible for the muon and ( later ) electron neutrinos .",
    "let the overall factor of flux uncertainty be denoted by @xmath125 for neutrino flavor @xmath126 .",
    "thus , e.g. , the actual muon - neutrino flux is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the theoretical muon - neutrino flux calculated in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , in the absence of neutrino oscillations , the ratio of measured and theoretical flux is just @xmath129 . in the presence of neutrino oscillations , on the other hand ,",
    "we instead obtain @xmath130 for any flavor @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath79 is the probability of oscillation from flavor @xmath21 to flavor @xmath35 .",
    "since the ratio @xmath131 is considered to be quite well determined theoretically , perhaps even to @xmath132 , due to known branching ratios of the pions @xcite and their decays , we conclude that the various factors @xmath125 are essentially the same for @xmath133 .",
    "this is consistent with the picture , which says that the uncertainty is due to uncertainty in the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "we will further also neglect contributions from the @xmath134 leptons in what follows .",
    "they should come from production of @xmath135 or @xmath136 mesons , but the relevant cross sections are small compared to the pion cross sections .    for the muon - neutrino ratio measured by several experiments , we obtain @xmath137 at @xmath138 gev ( super - kamiokande ) ,",
    "we have @xmath139 @xcite , and the last term can be neglected if @xmath140 is small , which turns out to be the case .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath141 .",
    "we will therefore calculate the solution with the overall factor @xmath142 varying from @xmath143 to @xmath144 in the experimental values for @xmath145 of upward - going events with @xmath146 .",
    "for the electron - neutrino ratio @xmath147 , the term @xmath148 is not negligable compared to the term @xmath149 , and can therefore not be neglected . instead of using @xmath150 as input",
    ", we will analyze @xmath150 as an outcome of the optimization process , i.e. , in terms of the fitted parameters .",
    "finally , the sensitivity for the atmospheric neutrinos can be divided into two groups .",
    "the first group ( soudan and super - kamiokande ) is sensitive to the small mass squared difference only , whereas the second group ( macro , kamiokande , and imb ) is sensitive both to the large and ( slightly ) to the small mass squared differences .",
    "changing the ratio from @xmath143 to @xmath144 times the quoted ones ( table  [ tab : experiments ] ) , will therefore influence the determination of the mass squared differences .",
    "the mean energies and path lengths for the accelerator neutrino experiments are all given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in most cases ,",
    "a measure of @xmath92 is given by half the length of the detector , giving @xmath151 in the range @xmath152@xmath153 .",
    "for the transition probabilities , we have used the presented @xmath154 c.l .",
    "upper bounds , except for the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment , for which we have used their quoted @xmath155 transition probability .",
    "the reactor neutrino experiments are all disappearance experiments with no signal detected .",
    "we have used the published @xmath154 c.l .",
    "bounds on disappearance signals mainly to limit the mass squared ranges .",
    "once these are outside the sensitivities of the reactor experiments , the solution will automatically reproduce these .",
    "for the reactor experiments , the uncertainties in @xmath7 are all small compared to the uncertainties in energy determination .",
    "to be able to minimize eq .",
    "( [ eq : obj ] ) we have to use numerical methods , since there is no successful way to do this with analytical methods , the present function being to large and we have far too many variables .",
    "our procedure will be as follows .",
    "first , we will use a very simple stochastic procedure .",
    "we choose some number ( @xmath85 ) of random points in the specified domain and evaluate the object function  ( [ eq : obj ] ) .",
    "we simply take the point which gives the smallest value of this function . to obtain good statistics",
    "we repeat this procedure @xmath156 times . including all 16 experiments , discussed in the previous section , and choosing @xmath157 and @xmath158 , we obtained @xmath159 where we have used @xmath160 the quantities @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the sample mean value and sample standard deviation , respectively .",
    "the point which generated the smallest value of the object function  ( [ eq : obj ] ) in our simulation was @xmath163 having these @xmath164 data points , we can now use them as initial points in a deterministic minimization procedure .",
    "we will use a sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) method .",
    "the results obtained are @xmath165 for the mean value and @xmath166 for the best point .",
    "finally , we have evaluated the theoretically expected probabilities for the different experiments , using the best point solution , to demonstrate that they are indeed consistent with experimental data .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab : probabilities ] .    upon varying @xmath142 ,",
    "we have made an analysis to see the effect on the different parameters in the model .",
    "the parameters then vary as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_depend ] .",
    "the stability of @xmath167 is to be noted .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath168 varies only slowly around @xmath169 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath170 varies from @xmath171 up to @xmath172 in the interval of @xmath142 investigated .",
    "just as expected , the mass squared differences change slowly to compensate for this change in the atmospheric values . as mentioned earlier , the reason for this is that the two first of the atmospheric experiments are sensitive to the small mass squared difference and the three others to the large mass squared difference .",
    "from the results in table  [ tab : probabilities ] , we see that the parameter set given as best point is indeed consistent with most of the experiments .",
    "it is clear from the beginning that the solar neutrino experiments can not all be reproduced with the parameter range used here , as was mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the more detailed super - kamiokande and kamiokande results , that include energy resolution of the solar neutrinos , are very well fitted by this solution .",
    "the gallex and homestake experiments are not so well fitted . in the case of gallex ,",
    "the fit is within two standard deviations , whereas the homestake result is several standard deviations off .",
    "the accelerator neutrino experiments are all well accounted for .",
    "it remains to be seen if further sampling of statistics in the lsnd experiment will confirm its present value for @xmath173 .",
    "finally , both reactor experiments are very well reproduced by the best point solution .",
    "the solution to the experimental constraints all give @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath170 varies from @xmath171 to @xmath172 as the flux factor @xmath142 varies from @xmath143 to @xmath144 times its nominal value of 1 .",
    "since the ckm matrix can be written as @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is a rotation by an angle @xmath178 in the @xmath179 plane , it is clear that @xmath180 corresponds to maximal mixing between the two lightest neutrinos , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "there are two particularly simple `` solutions '' more or less in the ranges of the mixing angles : ( a ) bimaximal mixing @xcite with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath167 and ( b ) single maximal mixing with @xmath185 , @xmath184 , and @xmath186 .",
    "these two `` solutions '' both reproduce data quite well ( apart from the lsnd experiment ) the atmospheric ones with the appropriate factor @xmath142 included .",
    "the ckm matrices for the simple `` solutions '' are given by @xmath187 and @xmath188 to be compared with the ckm matrix for the best point solution @xmath189 note that the matrix element @xmath190 is small compared to all the other matrix elements , in agreement with earlier suggestions @xcite .",
    "for the simple `` solutions , '' it becomes identically equal to zero .    for the double ratio ,",
    "we obtain approximately @xmath191 in our case , the ckm matrix is real so @xmath192 . using the published @xcite values for the theoretical @xmath193 flux ratio for the upward - going muon - neutrinos @xmath194 , we have calculated the ratio of ratios for the solution obtained with @xmath195 .",
    "this ratio also eliminates the uncertainty in the muon - neutrino flux from the atmosphere .",
    "the result is @xmath196 , in good agreement with the value given by the super - kamiokande collaboration of @xmath197 for multi - gev data .",
    "this indicates that the electron - neutrino ratio @xmath150 is also in agreement with data .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : r_l ] for the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath198 .",
    "our solution is also consistent with the @xmath199 asymmetry measured by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite , as well as with the corresponding @xmath200 asymmetry . with our approximations ,",
    "the @xmath199 asymmetry is given by @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the number of @xmath203-like upward - going events and @xmath204 is the number of @xmath203-like downward - going events .",
    "the measured value for multi - gev events is @xmath205 @xcite , which is consistent with the value @xmath206 obtained from our analysis when @xmath207 .    in the present analysis ,",
    "we have deliberately considered mass ranges for the solution that avoid the region where the solar ( and atmospheric ) neutrinos could be affected by the msw effect .",
    "we plan to address this question specifically in a future analysis . the mass range for the solar neutrino problem will then interfere with the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos .",
