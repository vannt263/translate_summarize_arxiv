    "the nuclear energy density functional approach is the many - body method of choice in order to calculate the properties of medium - mass and heavy nuclei in a systematic manner @xcite .",
    "parameterized ( non - relativistic ) skyrme functionals @xcite as well as relativistic mean - field models @xcite have been used widely and successfully for such nuclear structure calculations .",
    "likewise , some constraints from chiral ( pion - nucleon ) dynamics and the symmetry breaking pattern of qcd at low energies have been implemented into a pertinent relativistic point - coupling lagrangian in ref.@xcite .",
    "a complementary approach in the quest for a predictive nuclear energy density functional @xcite focusses less on the fitting of experimental data , but attempts to constrain the analytical form of the functional and the values of its couplings from many - body perturbation theory and the underlying two- and three - nucleon interactions . switching from the conventional hard - core nn - potentials to low - momentum interactions is essential in this respect , because the nuclear many - body problem formulated in terms of the latter becomes significantly more perturbative . indeed , second - order perturbative calculations provide already a good account of the bulk correlations in infinite nuclear matter @xcite and in doubly - magic nuclei @xcite .    in many - body perturbation",
    "theory the contributions to the energy are written in terms of density - matrices and propagators convoluted with the finite - range interaction vertices , and are therefore highly non - local in both space and time . in order to make such functionals numerically tractable in heavy open - shell nuclei",
    "it is desirable to develop simplified approximations to these functionals expressed in terms of local densities and currents only . in this construction",
    "the density - matrix expansion comes prominently into play as it removes the non - local character of the exchange ( fock ) contribution to the energy by mapping it onto a generalized skyrme functional with density - dependent couplings . for some time",
    "the prototype for that has been the density - matrix expansion of negele and vautherin @xcite , but recently gebremariam , duguet and bogner @xcite have developed an improved version for spin - unsaturated nuclei . they have demonstrated that phase - space averaging techniques allow for a consistent expansion of both the spin - independent ( scalar ) part as well as the spin - dependent ( vector ) part of the density - matrix .",
    "the accuracy of the new phase - space averaged density - matrix expansion and the original one of negele and vautherin @xcite has been gauged via the fock energy ( densities ) arising from ( schematic finite - range ) central , tensor and spin - orbit interactions for a large set of semi - magic nuclei . for a central force",
    "the fock energy depends primarily on the spin - independent ( scalar ) part of the density - matrix and a few percent accuracy is reached for both variants of the density - matrix expansion . on the other hand the fock energy due to a tensor force is determined by the spin - dependent ( vector ) part of the density - matrix . in that case",
    "the original density - matrix expansion of negele and vautherin @xcite leads to an error of about @xmath7 , whereas the new one based on phase - space averaging techniques reduces the error drastically to only a few percent . for further details on these extensive and instructive test studies we refer to ref.@xcite .    in order to match with these new developments",
    "the nuclear energy density functional as it emerges from chiral pion - nucleon dynamics has been recalculated recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "that calculation has treated for isospin - symmetric ( i.e. @xmath8 ) nuclear systems the effects from @xmath1-exchange , iterated @xmath1-exchange , and irreducible @xmath2-exchange with intermediate @xmath3-isobar excitations , including pauli - blocking corrections up to three - loop order .",
    "it has been found that the effective nucleon mass @xmath9 entering the energy density functional becomes identical to the one of fermi - liquid theory when employing the improved density - matrix expansion .",
    "the strength @xmath10 of the @xmath11 surface term as provided by the pion - exchange dynamics comes out in good agreement with empirical values in the density region @xmath12 . the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath13 receives contributions from iterated @xmath1-exchange ( of the ",
    "wrong sign  ) and from three - nucleon interactions mediated by @xmath2-exchange with virtual @xmath3-excitation ( of the  correct sign  ) . in the region around @xmath14@xmath15 where the spin - orbit interaction in nuclei gains most of its weight these two components tend to cancel , thus leaving all room for the short - range spin - orbit interaction . as a matter of fact",
    "the empirical value @xmath16mev@xmath17 of the spin - orbit coupling strength in nuclei agrees well with the one extracted from the short - range spin - orbit component of any realistic nn - potential @xcite .",
    "this part of the nn - interaction drives at the same time the strong lorentz scalar and vector mean - fields @xcite on which the whole success of the relativistic dirac phenomenology rests .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is the extend the calculation of the energy density functional in ref.@xcite to isospin - asymmetric many - nucleon systems with different proton and neutron densities .",
    "the supplementary isovector surface and spin - orbit terms play an important role in the description of long chains of stable isotopes and for nuclei far from stability .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the improved density matrix expansion of gebremariam , duguet and bogner @xcite whose fourier transform to momentum space provides the adequate technical tool to calculate the nuclear energy density functional in a diagrammatic framework . in section 3 , we present the analytical results for the density - dependent strength functions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 belonging to the isovector surface and spin - orbit terms . these analytical expressions give individually the effects due to @xmath1-exchange , iterated @xmath1-exchange , and irreducible @xmath2-exchange with intermediate @xmath3-isobar excitations , including pauli - blocking corrections up to three - loop order .",
