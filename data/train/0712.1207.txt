    "the major outstanding problem in nuclear physics is to calculate properties of finite nuclei starting from the basic interactions among nucleons .",
    "there are two aspects to this problem .",
    "first , the basic interactions among nucleons are complicated , they are not uniquely defined and there is evidence that more than just two - nucleon forces are important .",
    "second , the nuclear many - body problem is very difficult to solve .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the complex nature of the inter - nucleon interactions .",
    "interactions among nucleons are governed by qcd . in the low - energy regime relevant to nuclear structure ,",
    "qcd is non - perturbative , and , therefore , hard to solve .",
    "thus , theory has been forced to resort to models for the interaction .",
    "new theoretical developments , however , allow us connect qcd with low - energy nuclear physics through promising bridge of @xmath0eft  @xcite .",
    "in the _ ab initio _ ncsm , we consider a system of @xmath3 point - like non - relativistic nucleons that interact by realistic nn or nn+nnn interactions . unlike in standard shell model calculations ,",
    "in the ncsm there is no inert core , all the nucleons are considered active .",
    "therefore the `` no - core '' in the name of the approach . besides the employment of realistic nn or nn+nnn interactions , two other major features",
    "characterize the ncsm : i ) the use of an harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis truncated by a chosen maximal ho excitation energy @xmath4 relative to the unperturbed ground state of the @xmath3-nucleon system ; ii ) the use of effective interactions .",
    "the reason behind the choice of the ho basis is the fact that this is the only basis that allows to use single - nucleon coordinates and consequently the second - quantization representation without violating the translational invariance of the system .",
    "the powerful techniques based on the second quantization and developed for standard shell model calculations can then be utilized .",
    "therefore the `` shell model '' in the name of the approach . as a downside",
    ", one has to face the consequences of the incorrect asymptotic behavior of the ho basis .",
    "the second feature comes as a consequence of the basis truncation . in order to speed up convergence with the basis enlargement",
    ", we construct an effective interaction from the original realistic nn or nn+nnn potentials by means of a unitary transformation .",
    "the effective interaction depends on the basis truncation and by construction recovers the original realistic nn or nn+nnn interaction as the size of the basis approaches infinity . in principle",
    ", one can also perform calculations with the unmodified , `` bare '' , original interactions .",
    "such calculations are then variational with respect to the ho frequency @xmath5 and the basis truncation parameter @xmath6 .",
    "currently the most promising approach to the construction of accurate inter - nucleon forces from qcd is the @xmath0eft .",
    "the @xmath0eft predicts , along with the nn interaction at the leading order , an nnn interaction starting at the 3rd order ( next - to - next - to - leading order or n@xmath7lo )  @xcite , and even an nnnn interaction starting at the 4th order ( n@xmath8lo )  @xcite .",
    "the details of qcd dynamics are contained in parameters , low - energy constants ( lecs ) , not fixed by the symmetry .",
    "these parameters can be constrained by experiment .",
    "a crucial feature of @xmath0eft is the consistency between the nn , nnn and nnnn parts . as a consequence , at n@xmath7lo and n@xmath8lo , except for two lecs , assigned to two nnn diagrams ,",
    "the potential is fully constrained by the parameters defining the nn interaction .     and @xmath9 for which the binding energy of @xmath8h ( @xmath10 mev ) and @xmath8he ( @xmath11 mev ) are reproduced .",
    "( a ) @xmath12he ground - state energy along the averaged curve .",
    "( b ) @xmath12he charge radius @xmath13 along the averaged curve .",
    "dotted lines represent the @xmath13 uncertainty due to the uncertainties in the proton charge radius . ]     and @xmath9 for which the binding energy of @xmath8h ( @xmath10 mev ) and @xmath8he ( @xmath11 mev ) are reproduced .",
    "( a ) @xmath12he ground - state energy along the averaged curve .",
    "( b ) @xmath12he charge radius @xmath13 along the averaged curve .",
    "dotted lines represent the @xmath13 uncertainty due to the uncertainties in the proton charge radius.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we adopt the potentials of the @xmath0eft at the orders presently available , the nn at n@xmath8lo of ref .",
    "@xcite and the nnn interaction at n@xmath7lo @xcite .",
    "we use _ ab initio _ ncsm calculations in two ways .",
    "one of them is the determination of the lecs assigned to two nnn diagrams , @xmath14 and @xmath9 @xcite that must be determined in @xmath15 systems . @xmath14",
    "( @xmath9 ) is the strength of the @xmath16-@xmath17-@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) contact term .",
    "the other is testing predictions of the chiral nn and nnn interactions for light nuclei .",
    "it is important to note that our ncsm results through @xmath20 are fully converged in that they are independent of the @xmath6 cutoff and the @xmath21 ho energy .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ gs_he4 ] , where convergence of the @xmath12he ground - state energy using @xmath0eft interactions with and without the nnn terms is shown . for heavier systems",
    ", we characterize the approach to convergence by the dependence of results on @xmath6 and @xmath21 .",
    "[ cdce_curve ] shows the trajectories of the two lecs @xmath22 that are determined from fitting the binding energies of the @xmath23 systems .",
    "separate curves are shown for @xmath8h and @xmath8he fits , as well as their average .",
    "there are two points where the binding of @xmath12he is reproduced exactly .",
    "we observe , however , that in the whole investigated range of @xmath22 , the calculated @xmath12he binding energy is within a few hundred kev of experiment .",
    "consequently , the determination of the lecs in this way is likely not very stringent .",
    "we therefore investigate the sensitivity of the @xmath2-shell nuclear properties to the choice of the @xmath22 lecs .",
    "first , we maintain the @xmath23 binding energy constraint .",
    "second , we limit ourselves to the @xmath14 values in the vicinity of the point @xmath24 since the values close to the point @xmath25 overestimate the @xmath12he radius .    while most of @xmath2-shell nuclear properties , e.g. excitation spectra , are not very sensitive to variations of @xmath14 in the vicinity of the @xmath24 point , we were able to identify several observables that do demonstrate strong dependence on @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the @xmath26li quadrupole moment that changes sign depending on the choice of @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ cd_dep_10b ] , we display the ratio of the b(e2 ) transitions from the @xmath27b ground state to the first and the second @xmath28 state . this ratio changes by several orders of magnitude depending on the @xmath14 variation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the structure of the two @xmath28 states is exchanged depending on @xmath14 . from figs .",
    "[ cdce_curve ] and [ cd_dep_10b ] , we can see that for @xmath29 the @xmath12he radius underestimate experiment while for @xmath30 the lowest two @xmath31 states of @xmath27b are reversed .",
    "we therefore select @xmath32 for our further investigation .",
    "b excitation spectra as function of the basis space size @xmath6 at @xmath33 mev using the chiral nn interaction compared to experiment .",
    "the isospin of the states not explicitly depicted is @xmath34=0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    b excitation spectra as function of the basis space size @xmath6 at @xmath33 mev using the chiral nn interaction compared to experiment .",
    "the isospin of the states not explicitly depicted is @xmath34=0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we present in fig .",
    "[ b10_nn ] the excitation spectra of @xmath27b as a function of @xmath6 for the chiral nn interaction alone .",
    "the convergence with increasing @xmath6 is quite reasonable for the low - lying states .",
    "similar convergence rates are obtained for other @xmath35shell nuclei that we investigate .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath27b results is the observation that the chiral nn interaction alone predicts incorrect ground - state spin of @xmath27b .",
    "the experimental value is @xmath36 , while the calculated one is @xmath28 . on the other hand , once we also include the chiral nnn interaction in the hamiltonian , which is actually required by the @xmath0eft , the correct ground - state spin is predicted .",
    "further , once we select the @xmath14 value as discussed above , i.e. @xmath32 , we also obtain the two lowest @xmath28 states in the experimental order .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ b10b11c12c13 ] the natural parity excitation spectra of four nuclei in the middle of the @xmath35shell with both the nn and the nn+nnn interactions from @xmath0eft .",
    "the results shown are obtained in the largest basis spaces achieved to date for these nuclei with the nnn interactions , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "overall , the nnn interaction contributes significantly to improve theory in comparison with experiment .",
    "this is especially well - demonstrated in the odd mass nuclei for the lowest few excited states .",
    "the case of the ground state spin of @xmath27b and its sensitivity to the presence of the nnn interaction discussed also in fig .",
    "[ b10_nn ] .",
    "is clearly evident .",
    "we note that the @xmath27b results shown in fig .",
    "[ b10_nn ] were obtained with the ho frequency of @xmath33 mev , while those in fig .",
    "[ b10b11c12c13 ] with @xmath39 mev .",
    "a weak ho frequency dependence of the @xmath37 results is apparent .",
    "-shell configurations for @xmath27b , @xmath40b , @xmath41c , and @xmath42c calculated at @xmath37 using @xmath33 mev ( 14 mev for @xmath27b ) .",
    "most of the eigenstates are isospin @xmath34=0 or 1/2 , the isospin label is explicitly shown only for states with @xmath34=1 or 3/2 .",
    "the excitation energy scales are in mev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    further details on calculations presented in this section were published in ref .",
    "these calculations demonstrate that the chiral nnn interaction makes substantial contributions to improving the spectra and other observables . however , there is room for further improvement in comparison with experiment .",
    "we used a strength of the 2@xmath17-exchange piece of the nnn interaction , which is consistent with the nn interaction that we employed ( i.e. from ref .",
    "this strength is somewhat uncertain ( see e.g. ref .",
    "therefore , it will be important to study the sensitivity of our results with respect to this strength . further on",
    ", it will be interesting to incorporate sub - leading nnn interactions and also four - nucleon interactions , which are also order n@xmath8lo @xcite .",
    "finally , it will be useful to extend the basis spaces to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) for @xmath45 to further improve convergence .",
    "a shortcoming of the _ ab initio _ ncsm is its incorrect description of long - range correlations and its lack of coupling to continuum due to the expansion of the eigenstates in a finite ho basis . if we want to build upon the _ ab initio _ ncsm to microscopically describe nuclear reactions we can proceed in two ways .",
    "first , we can rely on techniques such as the lorentz integral transform that reduce the continuum problem to a bound - state - like problem . using this approach",
    ", we performed @xmath12he photo - disintegration cross section calculations using the @xmath0eft interactions  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated a sizeable effect of the chiral nnn interaction on the cross section .",
    "second , we can augment the _ ab initio _ ncsm basis by explicitly including cluster states and solve for their relative motion while imposing the proper boundary conditions .",
    "this approach , applicable to a wide range of reactions as well as to weakly bound states , is in the spirit of the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite . in our approach",
