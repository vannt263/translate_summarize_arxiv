    "the relativistic blast wave model ( @xcite , @xcite ) has met with considerable success in explaining the x - ray , optical and radio afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in this model , the impulsive release of @xmath0  @xmath1 ergs of energy ( e. g. , @xcite ) into a small volume results in the formation of a relativistic blast wave .",
    "the initial lorentz factor @xmath2 of material behind the shock wave reaches values of @xmath3  1000 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the dominant radiation mechanism responsible for the radio  x - ray afterglows from these relativistic blast waves is believed to be optically thin synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated behind the shock front ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "with rapid follow - up observations of the x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows of several grbs ( e. g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) it has become possible to determine in great detail the spectral and temporal characteristics of these afterglows , which can then be compared to the predictions of the relativistic blast wave model ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    the temporal evolution of flux levels and characteristic frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum from electrons in a relativistic blast wave can be formulated in a very elegant way , directly comparable to observations , if the blast wave is either perfectly adiabatic or fully radiative ( @xcite ) . however , while the comparison to afterglow data of several grbs suggests that at least in the late afterglow phase grb blast waves are well described by the adiabatic solution ( e. g. , @xcite ) , they can obviously not be perfectly adiabatic in order to be observable , and they are generally believed to be strongly non - adiabatic in the early afterglow phase .",

    "self - consistent solutions of the blast wave dynamics under realistic assumptions on the energy transfer from protons to electrons and on the magnetic field evolution , calculating the synchrotron ( and synchrotron self compton ) spectrum , solving for the evolution of the electron distribution behind the shock front and the blast wave dynamics simultaneously , have up to now only been possible numerically ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we show that under certain conditions , if the electrons are in the fast - cooling regime and the blast wave is relativistic , the blast wave kinetic equation can be solved analytically , yielding a simple , self - consistent analytical representation for the synchrotron emission from relativistic blast waves in general radiative regimes . in section 2 ,",

    "the figure illustrates that there are very pronounced differences between the light curves at a given frequency even for slight changes in the radiative efficiency .",
