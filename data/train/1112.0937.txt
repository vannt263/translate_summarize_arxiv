    "with serious astronomical observation of several decades , existence of dark matter is no longer doubtful . on another aspect , we definitely know that in the zoo of the standard model ( sm ) we do not have any candidates for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "question is what the dark matter particles are .",
    "there are many models proposed in literature  @xcite , but unless they are caught by our detectors in the terrestrial laboratories or satellites  @xcite , one still can not surely identify them .",
    "much efforts have been made to discover the dark matter flux from outer space .",
    "comparing with the spin - dependent cross section , the spin - independent cross section of dark matter particle with nucleus is much larger due to the @xmath0 enhancement where @xmath1 is the atomic mass number of the nucleus as the detection material  @xcite .",
    "even so , the cross sections of elastic scattering between dm particles and nuclei are still small , the present experiments have already reached @xmath2 @xmath3 . because of the advantage of the spin - independent scattering whose cross sections are larger and the theoretical treatment is relatively simpler than that for spin - dependent processes , nowadays , the priority of research is given to the study on spin - independent elastic dm - nucleus reactions .",
    "since the kinetic energy of the dm particle is rather low at order of a few tens of kev , the impact of dm particle on nucleus is almost impossible to cause inelastic processes , thus all observational signals are related to the recoil of nucleus after the collision .",
    "namely , even the collision occurs between dm and quarks ( seldom gluons in the case ) , all the absorbed energy is passed to the nucleus to make it to move as a whole object , the recoil which may induce thermal , electric and light signals . for the spin - independent cross section",
    ", the particle - physics and nuclear - physics contributions can be separated , namely the nuclear effects can be factored out and included in a form factor @xmath4 . for spherically symmetric nuclei , @xmath4 only depends on @xmath5 .",
    "the spherical symmetry means that the nuclei are of full - shell or close to full - shell structures , but for most of the nuclei which are taken as the detection materials the shells are not completely filled out . a careful study on form factors for",
    "the not - full - shell structure nuclei would be helpful for extracting information about fundamental interactions from the data .",
    "for that case , @xmath4 is not only a function of @xmath6 , but also @xmath7 while the azimuthal symmetry is assumed .",
    "we will write it as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "nucleus is a complex many - body system , therefore extraction from data requires a thorough analysis on the nuclear structure .",
    "the form factors for spherical nuclei have been carefully studied by many authors and the results can be applied to analysis of data . in this work",
    ", we are going to investigate the effects of deformation of nuclei on the form factor , namely we will derive the form factors corresponding to the deformed nuclei with relatively smaller ellipticity .",
    "we employ several models to calculate the form factors @xmath8 for nuclei with small ellipticity",
    ". we will take @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are commonly adopted as the detection materials as examples to illustrate the effects of deformation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , after this introduction , we present the expressions of the form factors derived from different models for nuclear density , and then present our numerical results via several figures . the last section is devoted to our conclusion and discussion .",
    "obviously it is reasonable to assume that the nucleus with a larger @xmath1 may be only quadruply deformed , namely it is deformed from spherical form to ellipsoidal . in the spherical coordinates ,",
    "the nuclear density of a nucleus with an elliptical form should be @xmath12 which is a function of both radius @xmath13 and polar angle @xmath14 and the corresponding form factor should be written as follows , it needs to be noted that we would set @xmath15 in practical calculation for simplifying the integration .",
    "@xmath16    even though this work is aiming to find the effects of deformation of nuclei on the form factor , the deviation from the spherical form for the nuclei under investigation is not severe , therefore , we can always start from a spherical form and then make reasonable modifications or extension .      a number of models have been proposed @xcite to describe the nuclear charge density or mass density . among them",
    "the two - parameter fermi distribution(2pf ) is one of the simple models . for a spherical form",
    "the density is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is equal to @xmath19 at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the diffusivity of the surface .",
    "it would be convenient for later use to derive the mean square root radius @xmath22 for the spherical 2pf model as @xmath23    for an elliptical nucleus with an axial symmetry , the nuclear density in the two - parameter fermi distribution ( e2pf ) model should be extended as @xcite : @xmath24[rho0 ] where @xmath25 the parameter @xmath26 which corresponds to the ellipticity of the nucleus characterizing its deformation from a spherical form , is a small quantity for the nucleus which we concern .",
    "for the priori assumption of small deformation , we only keep the multiple terms up to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be obtained by the normalization condition i.e. requiring the integration over whole coordinate space to be equal to the nuclear mass number ( or total charge ze ) which is priori set for various nuclei .",
    "@xmath26 can be obtained from the data book @xcite , and it is @xmath300.113 and @xmath300.224 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "@xmath21 denotes the surface diffuseness .",
    "here we choose the normalization as follows : @xmath33    xe for the extended 2pf model .",
    "it shows the change of density with increasing angle from 10@xmath34 to 90@xmath34 , the short dash dot line(green ) corresponds to the case of the spherical 2pf model , width=453 ]    xe form factors for deformed nucleus extended 2pf(e2pf)model from different directions : 10@xmath35 , 30@xmath35 , 45@xmath35 , 60@xmath35 , 90@xmath35 , width=453 ]    in fig.(@xmath36 ) we show the density distribution for @xmath37xe in the e2pf model .",
    "it is observed that from the center of the nucleus to about three fermis , the density remains unchanged in all directions .",
    "then the angular distribution of the density begins to be apart for different angles beyond three fermis .",
    "the short dash dot(green ) line is the 2pf density model when the nucleus is assumed to be spherical .",
    "fig.(@xmath38 ) is the corresponding form factors , which are calculated by taking a fourier transformation to the deformed nuclear density in the configuration space .",
    "there is another commonly adopted model which is rather simple , i.e. the nucleons are postulated to be uniformly distributed in a sphere with a certain boundary radius . for an axially symmetric ellipsoidal shape",
    ", one should extend the density for a spherical form .",
    "the surface equation of an ellipsoid is @xmath39or in the spherical coordinate system , it is written as @xmath40 in an approximation , if we only keep the multiple terms to quadrupole , we can re - parametrize the surface equation to a more convenient one @xmath41    extending the folding model , we set the nuclear density to be uniform inside the ellipsoid with radius @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the step function . following the literature  @xcite , we introduce a smearing function @xmath45 to take care of the soft edge effect of the nucleus : @xmath46 then one should convolve @xmath47 and @xmath45 to get the nuclear density @xmath48 the semi - axes @xmath49 and @xmath50 are set as @xmath51    in the extended folding ( ef ) model , we can also calculate the mean square root radius @xmath52 . for a spherical nucleus ,",
    "one may equate the mean square root radius obtained in the 2pf and fold models , thus he acquires the spherical radius @xmath53 for the fold model @xcite .",
    "@xmath54    as aforementioned , the deformation makes the shape of the nucleus slightly deviate from a spherical form , we can still use the above relation achieved for spherical nuclei and set @xmath53 to be the parameter in eq.([radius ] ) .",
    "a fourier transformation would bring the nuclear density to the expected form factor @xmath55 .",
    "it is noted that now the form factor is also direction - dependent . @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 we take a trick to make the integration easier as @xmath58 is described in the cylindrical coordinate while @xmath59 is described in the spherical coordinate as : @xmath60 then @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath63 the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the semi - axes defined above .",
    "thus the form factor in the ef model can be written as : @xmath64    in figure @xmath65 , the @xmath37xe density distribution determined by the ef model is shown , while the corresponding form factors are given in fig.4 .",
    "the short dash dot(green ) line corresponds to the spherical form of the nucleus . for the spherical nucleus",
    ", it has already been known that the form factor obtained with the 2pf model is very close to that determined by the folding model@xcite .",
    "thus we will also make a comparison between the e2pf and ef form factors at the end of the paper .",
    "then we will present the third model to do the same job in the following section .",

    "now we turn to use a more realistic model .    in this subsection",
    ", the form factors for deformed nuclei are obtained in the nilsson modified oscillator model , then using @xmath37xe as an example , we present the results in some figures .",
    "below , let us briefly review the model and show how we apply it to study the concerned form factor .    in the hamiltonian of the nilsson model the potential for an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator can be written as @xcite @xmath66-c{\\bf s}\\cdot { \\bf l } -d{\\bf l}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the spin - orbit coupling , and @xmath68 flattens the bottom of the potential .",

    "the nuclear density thus is expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 represents the time - reversed states .    in this paper ,",
    "the major shells under consideration are from 0 to 9 for proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "the quadrupole , octupole and hexadecapole deformation parameters are determined by experiments@xcite , which are -0.108 , 0 and 0.027 , respectively .    performing a fourier transformation on the nuclear density , we obtain the concerned form factor . on the right panel of fig.(@xmath87 ) , the angular dependence of the nuclear density of @xmath37xe is shown .",

    "the aim of this work is to study if a small deformation of nuclei can induce observable effects on the form factors for the direct detection of dark matter flux .",
    "the form factor , no matter the nuclei are of spherical or deformed shapes , say ellipsoidal , must satisfy two normalization conditions .",
    "first , the nuclear density must be normalized as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the total mass of the nucleus .",
    "it is independent of the shape of the nucleus .",
    "secondly , the form factor must satisfy the condition @xmath99 this condition does not depend on polar and azimuthal angles . with these two conditions , one can adopt different models for the nuclear density and then carry out a fourier transformation to convert the nuclear density from the configuration space into the momentum space to gain the form factor which corresponds to non - zero momentum transfer .    in this work ,",
    "we start with the spherical nuclei and adopt three models which are commonly employed to study the nuclear effects . then we extend them to deformed shapes by including polar angle dependence in the density while an axial symmetry is assumed for simplicity . with the three models we obtain the form factor for the nuclei whose shape slightly deviates from spherical form ,",
    "namely their ellipticity is relatively small .",
    "we notice from the figures shown in the text that the form factors are not very much apart from that for spherical form , indeed the dependence of the form factor on @xmath6 for @xmath100 is rather close to that for spherical shape .",
    "especially , if there is not a strong magnetic field to polarize the nuclei at very low temperature , the nuclei in the detection material would be randomly oriented , the polar and azimuthal angles would be averaged and the deformation effects should be eventually smeared out .    therefore , our conclusion is that unless one can keep the detector at very low temperature such as the cdms detector and apply a strong magnetic field to it , the effects of deformation of nuclei can be safely ignored .",
