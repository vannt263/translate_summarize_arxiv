    "the conditionally averaged wave - form for the ion saturation current is presented for peak amplitudes @xmath57 and a conditional window length of @xmath58 , which resulted in a total of @xmath59 non - overlapping events for this long time series .",

    "- conditionally averaged wave - form of the estimated radial velocity is shown in figure  [ ucav ] .",
    "this clearly indicates that the average radial velocity increases linearly with the amplitude of the ion saturation current and that the peak value of the velocity occurs on average at the same time as the peak value of the ion saturation current .",
    "this is in agreement with the cross - correlation function for these signals .",
    "however , there is a significant scatter between the different large - amplitude events .",
    "this is already suggested by the joint pdf  presented in figure  [ jpdf ] , and is further substantiated by the scatter plot between conditional peak amplitudes in the ion saturation current and the value of the estimated radial velocity at zero time lag , which is presented in figure  [ juscatter ] .",

    "there is thus a clear linear correlation between these signals , although there is a significant scatter .",

    "similarly , the distribution of the estimated radial velocity at the times of peak amplitude in the ion saturation current is presented in figure  [ ucdf ] .",
    "this is reasonably well described by a normal distribution , despite the fact that the probability distribution for the velocity fluctuations appears to have exponential tails , as seen in figure  [ spdf ] .",
    "however , it is emphasised that these are conditional velocity fluctuation amplitudes associated with bursts in the ion saturation current . further discussion of this topic can be found in section  [ discuss ] .          from the occurrence times of large - amplitude events in the ion saturation current signal , the waiting times between them is readily calculated @xcite . as shown in figure",
    "[ twait ] , for peak amplitudes larger than 2.5 times the rms value , the waiting time distribution is well described by an exponential function over three orders of magnitude on the ordinate .",
    "the mean value of the waiting time based on this fit is @xmath75 .",
    "it has been confirmed that the waiting time distribution is exponential for a large range of amplitude threshold levels .",
    "such an exponential distribution of waiting times is in accordance with a poisson process , suggesting that large - amplitude fluctuations in the far sol  are uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "figure  [ twaitj ] shows a scatter plot between peak amplitudes larger than 2.5 times the rms for the ion saturation current versus the following waiting time before a new event .",
    "a similar scatter plot is obtained for waiting times preceding conditional events in the saturation current .",
    "the linear product - moment coefficient vanishes in both cases , showing that there are no correlations between burst amplitudes and waiting times .",
    "this further supports the conjecture that large - amplitude fluctuations are uncorrelated .",
    "many previous investigations of plasma fluctuations in the tokamak boundary region have emphasised the presence of long range temporal correlations and clustering of events @xcite . in order to clarify these issues for the present tcv  data set ,",
    "the result from a rescaled range analysis of the ion saturation current signal is presented in figure  [ jros ] . of the values exhibited in a portion of the time series by the standard deviation @xmath42 of the values over the same portion of the time series . ] for a self - similar process , the rescaled range @xmath76 depends on the time lag @xmath77 as a power law , @xmath78 , where the self - similarity parameter @xmath79 is often referred to as the hurst exponent @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ jros ] , for temporal scales less than @xmath58 , the rescaled range is linear in the time lag which is expected for a smooth signal . for time",
    "lags longer than @xmath80 , the rescaled range is well described by a square root dependence , @xmath81 , which is the expected result for a white noise process .",

    "similar results are found for the floating potential measurements .     to @xmath58 a power law fit",
    "gives an exponent of @xmath82 , while for the range @xmath49 to @xmath83 a power law fit gives an exponent of @xmath84.,width=302 ]",
    "the results presented here show that the intermittent fluctuations in the far - sol  of tcv  can be described as a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with exponentially distributed amplitudes and a double - exponential wave - form with fixed shape and duration .",
    "these are exactly the assumptions underlying a recently developed stochastic model for intermittent sol plasma fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this model predicts an exponential auto - correlation function and that the plasma fluctuation amplitudes follow a gamma distribution with the shape parameter given by the ratio of the pulse duration and the average waiting time .",
    "accordingly , there is a parabolic relation between the skewness and flatness moments as shown in figure  [ kvss ] , which presents a scatter plot of flatness versus skewness for reciprocating probe data in previous density and current scan experiments on tcv  @xcite .",
    "the stochastic model thus explains the broad range of universality of fluctuations in the sol  of ohmic and low confinement mode tcv  plasmas @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the conditional wave - forms of ion saturation current and floating potential presented here agree with that found from many other devices @xcite .     versus skewness @xmath42 moments for the ion saturation current measured by probe reciprocations in tcv  plasmas with a scan in line - averaged density and plasma current .",
    "each point is calculated from time series of @xmath85 duration .",
    "the full line shows the parabolic relation predicted by a gamma distribution.,width=302 ]    measurements of the floating potential fluctuations and the estimated radial velocity show that these are strongly correlated with bursts in the ion saturation current signal .",
    "the floating potential has a dipole shape , as expected from theories of blob motion in sol  plasmas @xcite . from figures  [ jvcorr ] and  [ vcav ]",
    "it is clear that the floating potential structures have a significantly longer duration than the ion saturation current signal bursts @xcite .",
    "in particular , cross - conditional averaging shows that the maximum value of the dipole structures are recorded on both floating electrodes before the peak in the ion saturation current .",
    "this indicates that the plasma potential has a larger spatial scale length than the plasma filament itself , which is expected in the inertial velocity scaling regime for blob motion @xcite .    the fact that a single probe on average records a dipole shaped floating potential in the temporal domain , as shown in figure  [ vcav ] , indicates that blob - like structures have poloidal motion in the sol .",
    "indeed , the mean poloidal velocity can be estimated from the delay of the zero crossing of the floating potential recorded by the upper and lower probe pins .",
    "the average delay time is @xmath86 , so with a probe pin separation of @xmath6 this gives an estimated velocity of @xmath87 .",
    "the direction of this velocity is poloidally upwards at the probe position for this experiment .",
    "such vertical motion has previously been inferred from correlation analysis of probe and gas puff imaging measurements on other experiments @xcite .    associated with large - amplitude bursts in the ion saturation current",
    "are radially outwards electric drift velocities .",
    "the conditional peak amplitudes at the times of ion saturation current bursts are reasonably well described by a normal distribution , as shown in figure  [ ucdf ] . while there is a significant scatter of the conditional velocity amplitudes , the average velocity increases linearly with the peak amplitude in the ion saturation current , as is clear from figure  [ ucdf ] .",
    "however , the amplitude distribution for the estimated radial velocity fluctuations appears to have exponential tails , as shown in figure  [ spdf ] .",
    "this is confirmed by conditional averaging using the radial velocity itself as the reference signal , resulting in 2744 events without overlap .",
    "this reveals a nearly symmetric double - exponential wave - form with a duration of @xmath88 , presented in figure  [ ucav2 ] , and exponentially distributed peak amplitudes , presented in figure  [ ucdf2 ] .",
    "the reason for the bell - shaped cross - conditional wave - form seen in figure  [ ucav ] is likely due to scatter in the time of peak amplitudes in the ion saturation current and estimated radial velocity .",
    "the fast radial motion of filamentary structures in the sol  may significantly enhance plasma interactions with the main chamber walls .",
    "the radial transit time for blob structures in the present experiment is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the midplane separatrix to wall gap and the radial blob velocity is estimated as @xmath91 .",
    "the plasma loss time along the magnetic field is given by @xmath92 .",
    "thus , this rather conservative estimate gives a radial transit time that is an order of magnitude smaller than the parallel loss rate .",
    "this suggests that there is negligible parallel plasma transport associated with the large - amplitude filament structures as they move through the sol .",
    "cross - field transport of particles and heat in the sol  of magnetically confined plasmas is dominated by the radial motion of filament structures .",
    "the turbulence - driven transport results in broad plasma profiles in the far sol  and enhanced levels of plasma  wall interactions that may be an issue for the next generation plasma confinement experiments and future fusion power reactors .",
    "the average particle density and radial flux in the sol  evidently depend on the amplitude distribution of blob structures and their frequency of occurrence .",
    "revealing the statistical properties of plasma fluctuations in the sol  is thus crucial for the prediction of average profiles and plasma  surface interactions .    in this contribution , the fundamental statistical properties of large - amplitude plasma fluctuations and associated floating potential and radial velocity variations have been elucidated for an ohmic tcv  plasma based on probe measurements of unprecedented duration @xcite .",
    "the ion saturation current signal is found to be dominated by large - amplitude bursts with an exponential distribution of both peak amplitudes and waiting times .",
    "the latter suggests that blobs in the far sol  are uncorrelated  they occur independently of each other and at a constant average rate .",
    "the burst duration is found to be independent of the burst amplitude and has a double - exponential wave - form .",
    "associated with large - amplitude bursts in the ion saturation current signal is a dipole shaped floating potential structure and a radially outwards directed electric drift velocity and particle flux , with average peak values increasing with the saturation current burst amplitude .",
    "the potential fluctuations have a normal probability density function while the distribution for the ion saturation current and estimated radial velocity have exponential tails for large fluctuations .",
    "large - amplitude events in the estimated radial velocity signal are also well described by an exponential wave - form with exponentially distributed peak amplitudes .",
    "measurements such as those presented here provide invaluable input for both first principles based computations and stochastic modelling of plasma fluctuations in the far periphery of tokamaks . truly predictive capabilities of a model can only be claimed if simulation codes or stochastic models reproduce the salient fluctuation statistics derived from experimental measurements in the simplest plasma such a the one considered here .",
    "the results suggest further experimental investigations in order to clarify how the statistical properties of large - amplitude events change with sol  plasma parameters , in particular the line - averaged particle density and plasma current which change the collisionality in the sol .",
    "previous work along these lines have indicated a connection between transport in the sol  and the empirical discharge density limit @xcite .",
    "moreover , there have been few investigations on plasma fluctuations in the sol  in high confinement modes , such as quiet or inter - elm h - mode periods and i - modes .",
    "work in this direction will be undertaken in the near future .",
    "a stochastic model for intermittent fluctuations in the scrape - off layer is based on a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with a constant duration and shape @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the pulse shape , @xmath95 is the pulse amplitude and @xmath96 is the pulse arrival time for the pulse labeled @xmath97 .",
    "it assumed that the number of pulses @xmath98 occurring during a time interval of duration @xmath99 is distributed according to a poisson process . from this",
