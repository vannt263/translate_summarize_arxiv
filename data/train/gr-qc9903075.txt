    "in this work we investigate a class of spherically symmetric metrics in multidimensional ( md ) gravity .",
    "the metric ansatz which is used has off diagonal elements which leads to these solutions having `` electric '' and/or `` magnetic '' charges .",
    "the solutions examined here are either md wormholes or infinite / finite flux tubes .",
    "it is found that the type of solution obtained depends crucially on the relative magnitudes of these charges and thus on the form of the off - diagonal metric components . usually in the discussion of wormhole or blackhole solutions such off - diagonal elements",
    "are not considered , ( see for , example , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the off - diagonal components of the md metric play the role of gauge fields ( u(1 ) , su(2 ) or su(3 ) gauge fields ) , and a scalar field @xmath0 which is connected with the linear size of the extra dimension .",
    "these geometrical fields can act as the source of the exotic matter necessary for the formation of the wormhole s mouth .",
    "such solutions were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these works indicate that the exotic matter necessary for the formation of the wh can appear in * _ vacuum multidimensional gravity _ * from the off - diagonal elements of the metric ( the gauge fields ) and from the @xmath1 component of the metric ( the scalar field ) , rather than coming from some externally given exotic matter .    in refs .",

    "we require that all functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 be even functions of @xmath13 and hence @xmath14 .",
    "the ansatz function @xmath15 is the @xmath16-component of the electromagnetic potential and @xmath17 is the @xmath18-component .",
    "thus we have radial kaluza - klein `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "substituting this ansatz into the 5d einstein vacuum equations gives @xcite the following set of coupled , non - linear differential equations @xmath19 the kaluza - klein `` magnetic '' charge is @xmath20 .",

    "( [ 3 ] - [ 6 ] ) ) are dynamical equations which determine the ansatz functions , while the last equation ( eq . (",
    "[ 7 ] ) ) contains no new dynamical information not contained in the first four equations , but gives some initial conditions related to solving this system of equations . for the metric given in eq .",

    "a connection can be made between the present solution and wheeler s old proposal of electric charge as a wormhole filled with electric flux that flows from one mouth to the other  the `` charge without charge '' model of electric charge . in a recent work @xcite a model of electric charge along these lines",
    "was proposed where electric charge is modeled as a kind of composite wh with a quantum mechanical splitting off of the 5@xmath4 dimension .",

    "in this case we will simplify by taking @xmath53 in addition to @xmath54 so that the equations reduce to @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "these are three equations for two ansatz functions , @xmath57 .",
    "the last equation , eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , simply repeats information that is already contained in the first two equations .",
    "we solved the system of equations ( [ 11 ] ) - ( [ 12 ] ) numerically , using the _ mathematica _ package , with the following initial conditions : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ( where we are using the dimensionless quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) .",
    "these conditions and @xmath63 fix the dimensionless `` magnetic '' charge as @xmath64 .",
    "the detailed results of the numerical calculations for @xmath12 and @xmath65 are given in ref .",
    "the general shape of the cross - section function , @xmath12 of this solution can be seen in the last picture of fig . 1 . also from this picture",
    "one can see two singularities at @xmath66 .",
    "we interpret these singularities as the location of two magnetic charges ( @xmath67 ) with flux lines of kaluza - klein `` magnetic '' field going from @xmath68 to @xmath69 . near these singularities",
    "the ansatz functions have the following asymptotic behaviour : @xmath70 the time part of the metric appears not to be influenced by the strong gravitational field since @xmath71 .",
    "this result is similar to what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite @xcite where `` magnetic '' kaluza - klein components of the metric were considered .",
    "one difference between the present solutions and the monopole solutions of ref .",

    "548 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      in this case @xmath78 and an exact solution can be given @xcite : @xmath79 using this solution and eq .",
    "( [ 7c ] ) we find that the kaluza - klein `` electrical '' field is @xmath80 a similar magnetic flux tube - like solution was discussed in ref .",
    "the kaluza - klein `` magnetic '' field associated with this solution is @xcite @xmath81 thus , this solution is _ * an infinite flux tube * _ with constant kaluza - klein `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "the direction of both the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields is along the @xmath82 direction ( _ i.e. _ along the axis of the flux tube ) .",
    "the sources of these kaluza - klein fields ( 5d `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' charges ) are located at @xmath83 .",
    "this feature leads us to consider this solution as a kind of 5d `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' dipole .",
    "we consider two different cases : @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) .",
    "the initial conditions for both cases are taken as : @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these initial conditions along with a choice of @xmath91 determine the magnitude of the charges @xmath92 . as in the `` magnetic '' case we solved the system of equations numerically @xcite .",
    "as the `` magnetic '' field increases from @xmath50 to @xmath93 we found the following behaviour : first , compared to the wh - like solution of the pure `` electric '' case , the longitudinal distance between the surfaces @xmath51 is stretched as the magnetic field strength increases ; second , the cross - sectional size of the solution , represented by the function @xmath12 did not increase as rapidly as @xmath94 . in the limit where the `` magnetic '' field equals the `` electrical '' field , @xmath93 , the longitudinal length of the solution goes to @xmath10 and the cross - sectional size became a constant .      in this case",
    "the `` electrical '' field is taken as decreasing from the @xmath95 down to @xmath96 . as the `` magnetic '' field strength increases relative to the `` electric '' field strength we notice the following evolution of the solution : the infinite flux tube of the equal field case turns into a finite flux tube when @xmath97 drops below @xmath98 .",
    "also the cross - sectional size of this case has a maximum at @xmath99 and decreases as @xmath94 where the singularities occur .",
    "we take these singularities as the locations of the `` electric '' / `` magnetic '' charges . between the charges there",
    "is a flux tube of kaluza - klein `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "the longitudinal size of this flux tube ( the distance between charges ) reaches its minimum in the limit when there is only a `` magnetic '' field ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "as the relative strengths of the kaluza - klein fields are varied we find that the solutions to the metric in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) evolve in a very interesting and suggestive way :    1 .",
    "the solution is * _ a wh - like object _ * located between two surfaces at @xmath51 where the reduction of 5d to 4d spacetime breaks down .",
    "the cross - sectional size of these solution increases as @xmath13 goes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the throat between the @xmath51 surfaces is filled with `` electric''and / or `` magnetic '' flux . as the strength of the `` magnetic '' field",
    "is increased the longitudinal distance between the @xmath51 surfaces increases , and the cross - sectional size does not increase as rapidly as @xmath101 .",
    "2 .   @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the solution is * _ an infinite flux tube _ * filled with constant `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' fields , and with the charges disposed at @xmath83 .",
    "the cross - sectional size of this solution is constant ( @xmath102 ) . essentially , as the magnetic field strength",
    "is increased one can think that the previous solutions are stretched so that the @xmath51 surfaces are taken to @xmath83 and the cross section becomes constant .",
    "3 .   @xmath103 .",
    "in this case we have * _ a finite flux tube _ * located between two ( + ) and ( - ) `` magnetic '' and/or `` electric '' charges located at @xmath51 .",
    "thus the longitudinal size of this object is again finite , but now the cross sectional size decreases as @xmath101 . at @xmath104",
    "this solution has real singularities which we interpret as the locations of the charges .",
    "this solution is very similar to the confinement mechanism in qcd where two quarks are disposed at the ends of a flux tube with color electrical and magnetic fields running between the quarks . in the @xmath44 limit",
    "we find two opposite `` magnetic '' charges confined to a spacetime of fixed volume .",
    "this may indicate why single , asymptotic magnetic charges have never been observed in nature : they are permanently confined into monopole - antimonopole pairs of some fixed volume .",
    "finally , we note that in ref . @xcite some similar mappings between 4d gravity and non - abelian theory are discussed .",
    "the evolution of the solution from a wh - like object , to an infinite flux tube , to a finite flux tube , as the relative strengths of the fields is varied , is summarized in fig.1 .",
    "this allows two complimentary conclusions : first , if one takes some wheeler - like model of electric charge as in ref .",
    "@xcite then it can be seen that if the magnetic field becomes too strong the wh - like solution is destroyed and with it the wheeler - like model of electric charge .",
    "second , if one concentrates a sufficently strong electric field ( _ i.e. _ @xmath84 ) into some small region of spacetime one is led to the science fiction - like possibility that one may be able _ * to `` open '' the finite flux tubes into a wh - like configuration*_. this conjecture assumes some kind of spacetime foam model where the vacuum is populated by virtual flux tubes filled with virtual `` magnetic '' and/or `` electric '' fields .",
    "starting from the solutions obtained here we see that in 5d gravity there is a distinction between `` electrical '' and `` magnetic '' kaluza - klein fields .",
    "this can be contrasted with the 4d electrogravity reissner - nordstrm solution which is the same for the electrical and magnetic charges .",
    "this work has been funded by the national research council under the collaboration in basic science and engineering program ."
