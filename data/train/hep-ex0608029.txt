    "the @xmath4 was measured via its hadronic decay channel in minimum bias @xmath2 and au+au collisions at rhic and a mass shift of -40 and -70 mev/@xmath1 of the position of the @xmath4 was observed , respectively .",
    "while no explanations were explicitly attributed to the mass shift in @xmath2 collisions , the possible explanations for the apparent modification of the @xmath4 meson properties in au+au collisions were attributed to dynamical interactions with the surrounding matter , interference between various @xmath5 scattering channels , phase space distortions due to the rescattering of pions forming @xmath4 and bose - einstein correlations between @xmath4 decay daughters and pions in the surrounding matter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 meson measured in the dilepton channel probes all stages of the system formed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions because the dileptons have negligible final state interactions with the hadronic environment .",
    "heavy - ion experiments at cern show an enhanced dilepton production cross section in the invariant mass range of 200 - 600 mev@xmath6 , showing that the @xmath4 is broadened rather than shifted @xcite .",
    "the hadronic decay measurement at rhic @xcite , @xmath7 , was the first of its kind in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "since the @xmath4 lifetime of @xmath8 = 1.3 fm is small with respect to the lifetime of the system formed in au+au collisions , the @xmath4 meson is expected to decay , regenerate , and rescatter all the way through kinetic freeze - out .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath4 mass at rhic should reflect conditions at the late stages of the collisions @xcite .",
    "however , its has been shown that the @xmath4 width goes to zero with the @xmath4 mass dropping near the chiral phase transition , which is called the the vector manifestation and it can occur near @xmath9 in the hot and dense matter @xcite . in this scenario , the @xmath4 lifetime becomes very large and the @xmath4 produced at the early stages can also be measured in the hadronic channel .",
    "the modification of the @xmath4 properties in heavy - ion collisions has been expected @xcite , contrary to the modifications of the @xmath4 properties in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "similar modifications of that measured in @xmath2 collisions at rhic has been observed before at cern - lebc - ehs and cern - lep . until now , the mass shift measured in @xmath2 at cern - lebc - ehs has been attributed to phase space .",
    "the process of hadron - hadron collisions at low @xmath10 is not well understood .",
    "these collisions are viewed as a complicated interaction , where a perturbative treatment of the interaction dynamics is not possible . as a consequence ,",
    "only phenomenological models with assumptions about the partonic subprocess dynamics can be used to interpret the data . by studying soft hadronic interactions we may be able to explain the interaction dynamics of hadron collisions and possibly understand the parton hadronization mechanism , which is important in jet studies .",
    "one way of probing the dynamics of hadron - hadron collisions is to study the production of resonances , in particular , the @xmath4 meson .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that phase space does not account for the @xmath0 mass shift measured at rhic @xcite , cern - lebc - ehs @xcite and cern - lep @xcite and conclude that there are significant scattering interactions in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "we will first discuss the @xmath11 mass average from the pdg @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 mass average 775.8 @xmath12 0.5 mev/@xmath1 from @xmath13 was obtained from either @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the @xmath4 mass average was obtained from _ exclusive leptonic reactions_. similarly , the @xmath16 mass average 775.5 @xmath12 0.5 mev/@xmath1 was also was obtained from _ exclusive leptonic reactions_.    the @xmath11 averages reported by the pdg from reactions other than leptonic interactions are systematic lower than the value obtained from _ leptonic exclusive interactions _ by @xmath17 10 mev/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 production in these hadronic reactions are inclusive and exclusive . in the case of inclusive productions ,",
    "the phase space was take into account when the @xmath11 mass was measured ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these observations lead us to conclude that the @xmath11 mass depends on specific interactions , e.g. whether the @xmath11 is produced in inclusive or exclusive reactions . since a leptonic reaction and exclusive measurement of the @xmath4 lead to a negligible modification of any kind of the @xmath4 mass , the average 775.8 @xmath12 0.5 mev/@xmath1 @xcite from @xmath13 should correspond to the @xmath4 mass in the vacuum .",
    "the @xmath4 was measured in the hadronic decay channel @xmath18 at rhic , cern - lebc - ehs , and cern - lep in inclusive production . at rhic , the star collaboration measured the @xmath4 at @xmath3 200 gev at midrapidity ( @xmath19 ) and observed mass shifts of the position of the @xmath4 peak of about -40 mev/@xmath1 and -70 mev/@xmath1 in minimum bias @xmath2 and peripheral au+au collisions , respectively @xcite . the invariant mass distributions from @xcite",

    "the shift of the @xmath4 peak can be quantified by fitting the na27 @xmath5 mass distribution after subtraction of the mixed - event reference distribution to the bw function ( equation [ bwstar ] ) .",

    "the difference of a few mev between the two values is due to the different bw functions used in the analyzes .",
    "as mentioned , na27 obtained the @xmath4 mass by fitting the invariant @xmath5 mass distribution to the bw@xmath36ps function , and they reported a mass of 762.6 @xmath12 2.6 mev/@xmath1 , which is @xmath17 10 mev/@xmath1 lower than the @xmath4 mass in the vacuum .",
    "ideally , the ps factor should have accounted for the shift on the @xmath4 peak , and the mass obtained from the fit should have agreed with the @xmath4 mass in the vacuum .",
    "however , just like in the star measurement , this was not the case , since the phase space did not account for the mass shift on the position of the @xmath4 peak .    at cern - lep , opal , aleph and delphi",
    "measured the @xmath4 in inclusive @xmath13 reactions at @xmath37 90 gev @xcite .",
    "even though opal never reported the value of the @xmath4 mass , opal reported a shift on the position of the @xmath4 peak by @xmath17 70 mev/@xmath1 at low @xmath45 , where @xmath45 is the ratio between the meson and the beam energies , and no shift at high @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "opal also reported a shift in the position of the @xmath16 peak from -10 to -30 mev/@xmath1 , which was consistent with the @xmath4 measurement @xcite .",
    "aleph reported the same shift on the position of @xmath4 peak observed by opal @xcite . both opal and",
    "aleph used the like - sign method to subtract the background .",
    "delphi fit the raw invariant @xmath5 mass distribution to the ( bw@xmath36ps + bg ) function @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the threshold mass and bw is a relativistic breit - wigner function , for @xmath49 0.05 and reported a @xmath4 mass of 757 @xmath12 2 mev/@xmath1 @xcite , which is five standard deviations below the @xmath4 mass in the vacuum ( 775.8 @xmath12 0.5 mev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "as one can see , similarly to na27 , delphi assumed that the phase space was described by the background function .",
    "bose - einstein correlations were used to describe the shift on the position of @xmath4 peak . however ; high ( even unphysical ) chaocity parameters ( @xmath50 ) were needed @xcite .",
    "in @xmath2 collisions , most models assume that particles are born at hadronization according to phase space without any final state interaction . in multiparticle production processes , single - inclusive ( e.g. @xmath2 ) ,",
    "invariant particle spectra are typically exponential in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the exponential behavior does not require final state interactions and it can be due to phase space population at hadronization .",
    "the slope parameter in @xmath2 collisions are independent of the particle species @xcite . at rhic ,",
    "the @xmath4 spectra in minimum bias and high multiplicity @xmath2 are exponential in @xmath10 up to 1.1 gev/@xmath1 with slope parameters of @xmath17 180 mev . the @xmath4 spectrum in minimum bias @xmath2 @xcite is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . for reference ,",
    "the slope parameter of @xmath51 is @xmath17 160 mev @xcite .",
    "note that the slope parameter in @xmath2 is independent of the particle rest mass and shows @xmath52 scaling .",
    "these results are also independent of the multiplicity .",
    "however , the @xmath4 mass measured in @xmath2 at rhic is multiplicity dependent ( the mass shift in high multiplicity is higher than in minimum bias @xmath2 collisions ) @xcite , which is opposite to the slope parameter that is multiplicity independent .",
    "note that the systematic errors are correlate among themselves and between the two measurements .",
    "we will demonstrate that the mass should be independent of @xmath10 as well as multiplicity at hadronization without final state interactions . according to quantum mechanics ,",
    "a resonance at rest is described by the wave function , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the lifetime and @xmath55 is the energy at rest .",
    "the probability amplitude of the resonance decay can be written as @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and the probability amplitude is a non - relativistic breit - wigner distribution . when the energy conservation law is imposed in the partition of string fragmentation into multiple hadrons , a phase space factor , similar to the boltzmann factor in thermal distribution ,",
    "has to be added to equation [ bw ] .",
    "replacing @xmath61 by the invariant mass ( @xmath62 ) , the phase space is @xmath63 , where @xmath52 equals @xmath64 and t equals 160 mev .",
    "equation [ bw ] is then rewritten as @xmath65 however ; as discussed previously , the phase space does not describe the mass shift of the @xmath11 meson measured at rhic , cern , and lep .",
    "most event generators ( e.g. pythia @xcite and hijing @xcite ) create resonances according to a non - relativistic breit - wigner function at a given @xmath10 ( equation [ bw ] ) .",
    "however , we just showed that a more reasonable way to produce resonances is to use equation [ bwps ] .",
    "since the phase space of a non interacting multiparticle state _ can not _ explain the distortion of the @xmath4 line shape , we can conclude that the phase space in @xmath2 collisions also accounts for hadrons scattering and forming resonances . in the case of the @xmath4 , @xmath66 .",
    "this can be pictured in the string fragmentation particle production scenario , where the string breaks several times , two pions are formed , they scatter , and form a @xmath4 .",
    "such interactions are significant and modify the @xmath4 spectral shape in @xmath13 and @xmath2 from a relativistic @xmath67-wave breit - wigner function .    using the @xmath2 data from the top plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : cocktail ] and the rescattering formalism of @xcite , we can test the ideas of a mass shift having a @xmath5 scattering component .",
    "the di - pion production is given by equation 21 of @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath4 which is p - wave @xmath68 equation 21 becomes @xmath69 the @xmath70 is the p - wave phase shift ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath71 in our case becomes the breit - wigner times phase space equation [ bwps ] .",
    "@xmath72 becomes the direct production of @xmath4 for the @xmath10 range 600 to 800 mev / c .",
    "@xmath73 is the phase space overlap of di - pions in the @xmath74 1 partial waves .",
    "the pions emerge from a close encounter in a defined quantum state with a random phase .",
    "the emerging pions can re - interact or re - scatter through the p - wave quantum state or a phase shift .",
    "the phase space overlap comes from sampling the @xmath75 spectrum from @xmath2 collisions , where the sum of the @xmath5 has the correct @xmath10 range .",
    "the di - pion mass spectrum for this @xmath10 range falls with increasing di - pion invariant mass .",
    "the variable @xmath76 is related to the real part of the di - pion rescattering diagram and measures the range of interaction @xcite @xmath77 the @xmath78 is the radius of rescattering in fm and @xmath79 is 1.0 fm or the limiting range of the strong interaction .",
    "the ps is the phase space factor @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the momentum of the pions in the center - of - mass and @xmath82 is the size of interaction for the @xmath4 system and we use 1.0 fm distance to set @xmath82 at 200 mev/@xmath83 .    in order",
    "the fit the @xmath2 data we need to add the rest of the cocktail of resonances used by star @xcite . such a fit is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ron ] ( solid line ) , where the direct @xmath4 term time the phase space ( dotted line ) and the rescattered term ( dash - dotted line ) plus the sum ( dashed line ) are also depicted . in equation",
    "[ fit ] we have three parameters which are fitted .",
    "a scale factor on the phase space overlap of the di - pions .",
    "the direct production @xmath84 and @xmath76 .",
    "the value for @xmath76 form the fit is 0.47 , which implies @xmath78 = 0.73 fm .",
    "we see that the mass shift is a rescattering effect coming from a @xmath85 source which is not the @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath85 source becomes a @xmath4 through reinteraction .",
    "the mass shift of the @xmath11 seen in @xcite , where the @xmath4 is photoproduced , is due to the same rescattering effect , except that the direct production of the @xmath4 in this case is coherent with the @xmath86 source .",
    "star measured the @xmath4 at midrapidity and na27 measured at the forward region .",
    "in addition , there is the energy difference of @xmath3 200 and 27.5 gev , respectively .",
    "all these facts are consistent our model , the difference between the @xmath4 mass shift measure by star and na27 is due to pion multiplicity .",
    "similar arguments is valid for the @xmath11 measurements at cern - lep at @xmath3 90 gev indicating that there is also significant scattering interactions in @xmath13 reactions .",
    "we discussed that the natural mass of the @xmath11 meson should be measured in _ exclusive _ reactions only .",
    "we showed that a shift on the position of the @xmath4 peak has been measured before and that the phase space does not account for the @xmath0 mass shift measured at rhic , cern - lebc - ehs , and cern - lep .",
    "in addition , we discussed the phase space in @xmath2 collisions and concluded that there are significant scattering interactions in @xmath2 reactions .",
    "these interactions modify the @xmath4 line shape in @xmath2 and @xmath13 interactions from a breit - wigner function . using the rescattering formalism of @xcite",
    ", we can reproduce the @xmath4 mass shift measured by the star collaboration in minimum bias @xmath2 collisions .",
