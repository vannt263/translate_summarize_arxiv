    "here , we update the _ link _ of the monopole current using the metropolis method .",
    "we show in fig.1 the monopole density @xmath13@xmath7@xmath14 with the lattice volume @xmath15@xmath2@xmath16 and the clustering parameter @xmath17@xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the loop length of the @xmath20-th monopole cluster . with increasing @xmath21 , the monopole density @xmath13",
    "is reduced gradually for @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "the clustering parameter is drastically changed at @xmath24 .",
    "quantitatively , the critical value of monopole self - energy , @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 , is close to @xmath27@xmath25@xmath28 , which is derived from the entropy factor @xmath29 in the 4-dimensional self - avoiding random walk@xcite .",
    "such a transition is quite similar to the kosterlitz - thouless type transition in 1 + 2-dimensional superconductors .",
    "vortex condensation at high temperature in the superconductor corresponds to monopole condensation in the strong coupling region of qcd .",
    "in this section , we study confinement properties in the monopole current system with @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath2@xmath32 , which is the dual version of qed . to estimate the abelian wilson loop , we introduce the dual gauge field @xmath34 , since the gauge field @xmath35 inevitably includes the singularity as the dirac string in the presence of magnetic monopoles . using the relations @xmath36 and @xmath37@xmath2@xmath38@xmath39@xmath40 the dual gauge field @xmath41",
    "can be described from the monopole current @xmath30 , @xmath42 in the dual landau gauge @xmath43 .",
    "the wilson loop is obtained as @xmath44 in estimating the integral in eq.([eq : dual ] ) numerically , we should take _ a finer mesh than original lattice spacing @xmath45 _ to extract @xmath41 correctly . otherwise , the unexpected electric currents appear as the lattice artifact . however , too finer mesh is not necessary , because the original current @xmath46 includes the error in the order of @xmath45 .",
    "numerical analyses show that the calculation with @xmath47 is good enough for the estimation of @xmath41 , and hence we take @xmath48 hereafter . on lattices , the dual gauge field @xmath49 is defined in the dual landau gauge ; @xmath50 using the lattice coulomb propagator @xmath51 . the dual version of the abelian field strength @xmath52 is defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the backward derivative .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the wilson loop @xmath55 exhibits the area law , which leads to the linear confinement potential . in fig.3 , we show the string tension @xmath56 in the lattice unit . for @xmath21@xmath57@xmath24 ,",
    "the string tension is finite due to the long monopole currents , the current simulations for @xmath21@xmath58@xmath24 indicate that @xmath59@xmath25@xmath32 in the system without monopole currents . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice qcd simulations show that the long monopole currents cover the whole system and string tension is finite in the confinement phase even for the large @xmath60 as @xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 on @xmath64 lattices .",
    "therefore , the monopole self - energy @xmath21 extracted from qcd must be smaller than @xmath24@xmath7 ln(@xmath65 ) = ln7 in the confinement phase . here , to extract the monopole action , one should use the monopole part in qcd , where only monopole currents exist . since the electric current and the short - range coulomb force can not be expressed only by the monopole currents ,",
    "it is dangerous to compare the monopole action with the full su(2 ) qcd ( or the abelian part ) ; the former includes monopole currents only , while the latter includes also electric currents and coulomb force . in any case , _ the monopole action is to be extracted from the monopole part in qcd and the monopole self - energy @xmath21 should be smaller than @xmath24=ln7 in the confinement phase . _",
    "the aim of our study is to analyze the theoretical structure of qcd in terms of the monopole degrees of freedom .",
    "our studies indicate that the multi - monopole system has a similar structure to qcd in the ma gauge . however , the monopole in abelian - projected qcd has the underlying structure reflecting qcd .",
    "for instance , qcd - monopoles would be as _ extended objects _ like hadrons@xcite , because it is not an elementary particle in qcd , but a _ collective mode composed by gluons_. we compare the monopole current system with qcd @xcite especially in terms of the self - energy and the size of monopoles@xcite .    in the static frame of the monopole with an intrinsic radius @xmath66",
    ", the spherical magnetic field is created around the monopole as @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70@xmath71@xmath66 , with qcd running gauge coupling @xmath72@xcite .    for @xmath45@xmath73@xmath66 ,",
    "the electromagnetic energy observed on the lattice around a monopole is roughly estimated as @xmath74@xmath25@xmath75@xmath25@xmath76 which largely depends on the lattice mesh @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the monopole contribution to the lattice action reads @xmath77@xmath2@xmath78@xmath10@xmath79 , where @xmath79 denotes the monopole current length measured in the lattice unit @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 is related to the monopole - current coupling @xmath3 and @xmath60@xmath2@xmath81 , @xmath82@xmath25@xmath78@xmath25@xmath83@xmath2@xmath84@xmath10@xmath85 by the screening effect , this relation becomes @xmath82@xmath25@xmath86@xmath10@xmath87@xcite , which is consistent with the numerical result as shown in fig.3 .",
    "thus , as long as the mesh is large as @xmath45@xmath73@xmath66 , the lattice monopole action would not need modification by the monopole size effect , and @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a critical coupling @xmath24@xmath25@xmath887 in the current dynamics . above @xmath24 ,",
    "the lattice current action provides no monopole condensation and no confinement , while @xmath60@xmath89@xmath90 can be taken in the original qcd keeping the confinement property shown in fig.3 .",
    "such a discrepancy between @xmath60 and @xmath21 can be naturally interpreted by introducing the monopole size effect , which should lead the nonlinear correspondence between @xmath21 and @xmath60 . for @xmath21@xmath91@xmath66 , the extended structure of the monopole",
    "can be observed on the lattice , and the monopole creates the electromagnetic energy @xmath74 @xmath25@xmath92@xmath2@xmath93 on the lattice , which is almost @xmath45-independent .",
    "accordingly , the lattice action should be changed as @xmath1@xmath2@xmath94@xmath10@xmath95 because of the self - avoidness originating from the monopole size @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the monopole - current theory becomes nonlocal in the uv region .",
    "the monopole size @xmath66 provides a critical scale for the description of qcd in terms of the dual higgs mechanism . in the infrared region as @xmath45@xmath73@xmath66 , qcd can be approximated as a local monopole - current action@xcite , and the qcd vacuum can be regarded as the dual superconductor . on the other hand , in the ultraviolet region as @xmath45<@xmath66 ,",
    "the monopole theory becomes nonlocal and complicated due to the monopole size effect , and the perturbative qcd would be applicable instead .",
