    "over the past decade , type ia supernovae have been used successfully as standard candles to facilitate the acquisition of several important cosmological parameters . on the basis of this work ,",
    "it is now widely believed that the universe s expansion is accelerating ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . in standard cosmology ,",
    "built on the assumption of spatial homogeneity and isotropy , such an expansion requires the existence of a third form of energy , beyond the basic admixture of ( visible and dark ) matter and radiation .",
    "one may see this directly from the ( cosmological ) friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) differential equations of motion , usually written as @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 in which an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath4 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent , respectively , the total energy density and total pressure . in these expressions , @xmath15 is the expansion factor , and @xmath16 are the coordinates in the comoving frame .",
    "the constant @xmath17 is @xmath18 for a closed universe , @xmath19 for a flat ( or open ) universe , and @xmath20 for an open universe .",
    "following convention , we write the equation of state as @xmath21 .",
    "a quick inspection of equation ( 2 ) shows that an accelerated expansion ( @xmath22 ) requires @xmath23 .",
    "thus , neither radiation ( @xmath24 , with @xmath25 ) , nor ( visible and dark ) matter ( @xmath26 , with @xmath27 ) can satisfy this condition , leading to the supposition that a third ` dark ' component @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) of the energy density @xmath13 must be present . in principle , each of these contributions to @xmath13 may evolve according to its own dependence on @xmath15 .    over the past few years",
    ", complementary measurements ( spergel et al . 2003 ) of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have indicated that the universe is flat ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) , so @xmath13 is at ( or very near ) the  critical \" density @xmath31 .",
    "but among the many peculiarities of the standard model is the inference , based on current observations , that @xmath28 must itself be of order @xmath32 .",
    "dark energy is often thought to be the manifestation of a cosmological constant , @xmath33 , though no reasonable explanation has yet been offered as to why such a fixed , universal density ought to exist at this scale .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath33 is associated with the energy of the vacuum in quantum theory , it should have a scale representative of phase transitions in the early universe  many , many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath32 .",
    "many authors have attempted to circumvent these difficulties by proposing alternative forms of dark energy , including quintessence ( wetterich 1988 ; ratra and peebles 1988 ) , which represents an evolving canonical scalar field with an inflation - inducing potential , a chameleon field ( khoury and weltman 2004 ; brax et al .",
    "2004 ) in which the scalar field couples to the baryon energy density and varies from solar system to cosmological scales , and modified gravity , arising out of both string motivated ( davli et al . 2000 ) , or general relativity modified ( capozziello et al .",
    "2003 ; carroll et al .",
    "2004 ) actions , which introduce large length scale corrections modifying the late time evolution of the universe .",
    "the actual number of suggested remedies is far greater than this small , illustrative sample .",
    "nonetheless , though many in the cosmology community suspect that some sort of dynamics is responsible for the appearance of dark energy , until now the sensitivity of current observations has been deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model of a time - independent cosmological constant @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , corasaniti et al .",
    "this conclusion , however , appears to be premature , given that the role of our cosmic horizon has not yet been fully folded into the interrogation of current observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a closer scrutiny of the available data , if proven to be reliable , can in fact already delineate between evolving and constant dark energy theories , and that a simple cosmological constant @xmath33 , characterized by a fixed @xmath34 , is almost certainly ruled out . in   2 of this paper , we will introduce the cosmic horizon and discuss its evolution in time , demonstrating how measurements of the hubble constant @xmath35 may be used to provide strict constraints on @xmath36 , independent of type ia supernova data .",
    "we will compare these results with predictions of the various classes of dark energy models in    3 and 4 , and",
    "conclude with a discussion of the consequences of these comparisons in   5 .",
    "the hubble space telescope key project on the extragalactic distance scale has measured the hubble constant @xmath35 with unprecedented accuracy ( mould et al .",
    "2000 ) , yielding a current value @xmath37 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 .",
    "( for @xmath35 and @xmath4 , we will use subscript  0 \" to denote cosmological values pertaining to the current epoch . ) with this @xmath39 , we infer that @xmath40 ergs @xmath41 .    given such precision , it is now possible to accurately calculate the radius of our cosmic horizon , @xmath0 , defined by the condition @xmath42 where @xmath43 . in terms of @xmath13 , @xmath44 or , more simply , @xmath45 in a flat universe .",
    "this is the radius at which a sphere encloses sufficient mass - energy to turn it into a schwarzschild surface for an observer at the origin of the coordinates @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the time corresponding to @xmath49 ( melia 2007 ) .",
    "when the robertson - walker metric is written in terms of these observer - dependent coordinates , the role of @xmath0 is to alter the intervals of time we measure ( using the clocks fixed to our origin ) , in response to the increasing spacetime curvature induced by the mass - energy enclosed by a sphere with radius @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "the time @xmath4 is identical to @xmath51 only at the origin ( @xmath52 ) . for all other radii ,",
    "our measurement of a time interval @xmath53 necessarily comes with a gravitational time dilation which diverges when @xmath50 .",
    "it is therefore physically impossible for us to see any process occurring beyond @xmath0 , and this is why the recent observations have a profound impact on our view of the cosmos .",
    "for example , from the hubble measurement of @xmath54 , we infer that @xmath55 billion light - years ; this is the maximum distance out to which measurements of the cosmic parameters may be made at the present time .    let us now consider how this radius evolves with the universal expansion .",
    "clearly , in a de sitter universe with a constant @xmath13 , @xmath0 is fixed forever .",
    "but for any universe with @xmath56 , @xmath0 must be a function of time . from the definition of @xmath0 and equation ( 3 )",
    ", we see that @xmath57 a remarkably simple expression that nonetheless leads to several important conclusions regarding our cosmological measurements ( melia 2008 ) .",
    "we will use it here to distinguish between constant and evolving dark energy theories .    take @xmath4 to be some time in the distant past (",
    "so that @xmath58 ) . then , integrating equation ( 5 ) from @xmath4 to @xmath2 , we find that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the time - averaged value of @xmath36 from @xmath4 to the present time .    now ,",
    "for any @xmath61 , @xmath13 drops as the universe expands ( i.e. , as @xmath15 increases with time ) , and since @xmath62 , clearly @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 the reason we can use the behavior of @xmath0 as the universe expands to probe the nature of dark energy is that the latter directly impacts the value of @xmath65 .",
    "a consideration of how the cosmic horizon @xmath0 evolves with time can therefore reveal whether or not dark energy is dynamically generated .",
    "indeed , we shall see in the next section that the current observations , together with equation ( 8) , are already quite sufficient for us to differentiate between the various models .    before we do that , however , we can already see from this expression why the standard model of cosmology contains a glaring inconsistency ( melia 2008 ) . from wmap observations",
    "( spergel et al . 2003 ) , we infer that the age @xmath2 of the universe is @xmath66 billion years .",
    "since @xmath55 billion light - years , this can only occur if @xmath67 .",
    "of course , this means that the existence of dark energy ( with such an equation of state ) is required by the wmap and hubble observations alone , independently of the type ia supernova data .",
    "but an analysis of the latter ( see below ) reveals that the value @xmath68 is ruled out , so in fact @xmath69 .",
    "that means that @xmath70 ; in fact , @xmath0 must be less than @xmath71 , which in turns suggests that the universe is older than we think . what we infer to be the time since the big bang , is instead the  horizon \" time @xmath72 , which must be shorter than @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed in melia ( 2008 ) , this has some important consequences that may resolve several long - standing conflicts in cosmology . through our analysis in the next section",
    ", we will gain a better understanding of this phenomenon , which will permit us to calculate @xmath2 more precisely .",
    "the standard model of cosmology contains a mixture of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant with an energy density fixed at the current value , @xmath73 , and an equation of state with @xmath74 .",
    "known as @xmath33cdm , this model has been reasonably successful in accounting for large scale structure , the cosmic microwave background fluctuations , and several other observed cosmological properties ( see , e.g. , ostriker and steinhardt 1995 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; melchiorri et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "but let us now see whether @xmath33cdm is also consistent with our understanding of @xmath0 .",
    "putting @xmath75 , where @xmath26 is the time - dependent matter energy density , we may integrate equation ( 5 ) for a @xmath33cdm cosmology , starting at the present time @xmath2 , and going backwards towards the era when radiation dominated @xmath13 ( somewhere around 100,000 years after the big bang ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the run of @xmath76 as a function of time , along with the time - averaged @xmath36 given in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "the present epoch is indicated by a vertical dotted line .",
    "the calculation begins at the present time @xmath2 , with the initial value @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is the equation - of - state parameter @xmath36 averaged over the entire universal expansion , obtained by an iterative convergence of the solution to equation ( 5 ) . in @xmath33cdm ,",
    "the matter density increases towards the big bang , but @xmath80 is constant , so the impact of @xmath81 on the solution vanishes as @xmath82 ( see the dashed curve in figure  1 ) .",
    "thus , as expected , @xmath83 early in the universe s development .",
    "what is rather striking about this result is that in @xmath33cdm , @xmath84 approaches @xmath3 only once in the entire history of the universe  and this is only because we have imposed this requirement as an initial condition on our solution .",
    "there are many peculiarities in the standard model , some of which we will encounter shortly , but the unrealistic coincidence that @xmath0 should approach @xmath71 only at the present moment must certainly rank at  or near  the top of this list .",
    "-0.1 in    0.1 in    though it may not be immediately obvious , this seemingly contrived scenario is actually related to the so - called  coincidence problem \" in @xmath33cdm cosmology , arising from the peculiar near - simultaneous convergence of @xmath26 and @xmath80 towards @xmath32 in the present epoch .",
    "just as @xmath85 only at @xmath2 ( see figure  1 ) , so too @xmath86 just now ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "even so , it is one thing to suppose that @xmath87 only near the present epoch ; it takes quite a leap of faith to go one step further and believe that @xmath88 only now . this odd behavior must certainly cast serious doubt on the viability of @xmath33cdm cosmology as the correct description of the universe .",
    "a confirmation that the basic @xmath33cdm model is simply not viable is provided by attempts ( figure  3 ) to fit the type ia supernova data with the evolutionary profiles shown in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "the comoving coordinate distance from some time @xmath4 in the past to the present is @xmath89 . with @xmath30 ,",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath90 is @xmath91 , where the redshift @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 , in terms of the expansion factor @xmath15 plotted in figure  2 .",
    "-0.1 in    0.1 in    the data in figure  3 are taken from the  gold \" sample of riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with coverage in redshift from @xmath19 to @xmath94 .",
    "the distance modulus is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 .",
    "the dashed curve in this plot represents the fit based on the @xmath33cdm profile shown in figures  1 and 2 , with a hubble constant @xmath97 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 ( @xmath98 is used as a free optimization parameter in each of figures  3 , 6 , and 9 ) .",
    "the  best \" match corresponds to @xmath99 , for which the reduced @xmath100 is an unacceptable @xmath101 with @xmath102 d.o.f .",
    "attempts to fix this failure have generally been based on the idea that there must have been a transition point , at a redshift @xmath103 , from past deceleration to present acceleration ( riess et al .",
    "one can easily see from figure  3 that the 16 high - redshift type ia supernovae , detected at @xmath104 with the hubble space telescope , fall well below the distance expected for them in basic @xmath33cdm .",
    "but even if these modifications can somehow be made consistent with the supernova data , in the end they must still comply with the unyielding constraints imposed on us by the measured values of @xmath0 and @xmath71 .",
    "no such relief patch can remove the inexplicable ( and simply unacceptable ) coincidence implied by the required evolution of @xmath76 towards 1 only at the present time ( figure  1 ) .",
    "it is difficult avoiding the conclusion that @xmath33cdm is simply not consistent with the inferred properties of dark energy in light of the cosmic horizon .",
    "given the broad range of alternative theories of dark energy that are still considered to be viable , it is beyond the scope of this paper to exhaustively study all dynamical scenarios .",
    "instead , we shall focus on a class of solutions with particular importance to cosmology  those in which the energy density of the scalar field mimics the background fluid energy density .",
    "cosmological models in this category are known as  scaling solutions , \" characterized by the relation @xmath105 ( some of the early papers on this topic include the following : copeland et al .",
    "1998 ; liddle and scherrer 1999 ; van den hoogen et al . 1999 ; uzan 1999 ; de la macorra and piccinelli 2000 ; nunes and mimoso 2000 ; ng et al . 2001 ; rubano and barrow 2001 ) .    by far",
    "the simplest cosmology we can imagine in this class is that for which @xmath106 , corresponding to @xmath107 ( within the errors ) .",
    "this model is so attractive that it almost begs to be correct .",
    "unfortunately , it is not fully consistent with type ia supernova data , so either our interpretation of current observations is wrong or the universe just does nt work this way .",
    "but it s worth our while spending some time with it because of the shear elegance it brings to the table .",
    "-0.1 in    0.1 in    to begin with , we see immediately from equation ( 5 ) ( and illustrated in figures  4 and 5 ) that when @xmath106 , we have @xmath108 .",
    "instantly , this solves three of the major problems in standard cosmology : first , it explains why @xmath109 should be equal to @xmath71 ( because these quantities are always equal ) .",
    "second , it completely removes the inexplicable coincidence that @xmath28 and @xmath26 should be comparable to each other only in the present epoch ( since they are always comparable to each other ) .",
    "third , it does away with the so - called flatness problem ( melia 2008 ) . to see this ,",
    "let us return momentarily to equation ( 1 ) and rewrite it as follows : @xmath110 whether or not the universe is asymptotically flat hinges on the behavior of @xmath111 as @xmath112 .",
    "but from the definition of @xmath0 ( equation 4 ) , we infer that @xmath113 thus , if @xmath106 , @xmath114 and so @xmath115 we also learn from equation ( 2 ) that in this universe , @xmath116 .",
    "the universe is coasting , but not because it is empty , as in the milne cosmology ( milne 1940 ) , but rather because the change in pressure as it expands is just right to balance the change in its energy density .",
    "-0.1 in    0.1 in    all told , these are quite impressive accomplishments for such a simple model , and yet , it does nt appear to be fully consistent with type ia supernova data . repeating the calculation that produced figure  3 , only now for our scaling solution with @xmath106",
    ", we obtain the best fit shown in figure  6 .",
    "this is a significant improvement over @xmath33cdm , but the resultant @xmath100 ( @xmath117 ) is still unacceptable . interestingly , if we were to find a slight systematic error in the distance modulus for the events at @xmath118 , which for some reason has led to a fractional over - estimation in their distance ( or , conversely , a systematic error that has lead to an under - estimation of the distance modulus for the nearby explosions ) , the fit would improve significantly .",
    "so our tentative conclusion right now must be that , although an elegant scaling solution with @xmath106 provides a much better description than @xmath33cdm of the universe s expansion , it is nonetheless still not fully consistent with the supernova data .",
    "fortunately , many of the attractive features of an @xmath106 cosmology are preserved in the case where @xmath119 , corresponding to a scaling solution with @xmath120 .",
    "this model fits the supernova data quite strikingly , but it comes at an additional cost  we would have to accept the fact that the universe is somewhat older ( by a few billion years ) than we now believe . actually , this situation is unavoidable for any cosmology with @xmath23 because of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath71 in equation ( 8) .",
    "-0.1 in    0.1 in    we see in figure  7 that @xmath76 is constant , but at a value @xmath121 , where the time - averaged @xmath36 is now @xmath122 .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is 13.5 billion light - years , @xmath2 must be approximately 16.9 billion years .",
    "the explanation for this ( melia 2008 ) is that what we believe to be the universe s age is actually the horizon time @xmath7 , which is shorter than its actual age @xmath2 . in figure  7 , the distinction between @xmath123 and @xmath2 is manifested primarily through the termination points of the @xmath0 and @xmath65 curves , which extend past the vertical dotted line at @xmath124 .",
    "ironically , this unexpected result has several important consequences , such as offering an explanation for the early appearance of supermassive black holes ( at a redshift @xmath9 ; see fan et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group ( see klypin et al . 1999 ) . both of these long - standing problems in cosmology would be resolved if the universe were older .",
    "supermassive black holes would have had much more time ( @xmath125 billion years ) to form than current thinking allows ( i.e. , only @xmath126 million years ) , and dwarf halos would correspondingly have had more time to merge hierarchically , depleting the lower mass end of the distribution .",
    "-0.1 in    0.1 in    the matter and dark energy densities corresponding to the @xmath119 scaling solution are shown as functions of cosmic time in figure  8 , along with the evolution of the scale factor @xmath15 . here too , the  coincidence problem \" does not exist , and the flatness problem is resolved since @xmath127 as @xmath112 in equation ( 10 ) , so the constant in equation ( 13 ) should be @xmath128 at late times , regardless of the value of @xmath17 . very importantly , this model fits the type ia supernova data very well , as shown in figure  9 .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath129 , with a reduced @xmath130 for @xmath102 d.o.f .",
    "our main goal in this study has been to examine what we can learn about the nature of dark energy from a consideration of the cosmic horizon @xmath0 and its evolution with cosmic time .",
    "a principal outcome of this work is the realization that the so - called  coincidence \" problem in the standard model is actually more severe than previously thought .",
    "we have found that in a @xmath33cdm universe , @xmath88 only once , and according to the observations , this must be happening right now . coupled to the fact that the basic @xmath33cdm model does not adequately account for the type ia supernova data without introducing new parameters and patching together phases of deceleration and acceleration that must somehow blend together only in the current epoch ,",
    "this is a strong indication that dark energy almost certainly is not due to a cosmological constant .",
    "other issues that have already been discussed extensively in the literature , such as the fact that the vacuum energy in quantum theory should greatly exceed the required value of @xmath33 , only make this argument even more compelling . of course , this rejection of the cosmological - constant hypothesis then intensifies interest into the question of why we do nt see any vacuum energy at all , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "many alternatives to a cosmological constant have been proposed over the past decade but , for the sake of simplicity , we have chosen in this paper to focus our attention on scaling solutions .",
    "the existence of such cosmologies has been discussed extensively in the literature , within the context of standard general relativity , braneworlds ( randall - sundrum and gauss - bonnett ) , and cardassian scenarios , among others ( see , e.g. , maeda 2001 ; freese and lewis 2002 ; and fujimoto and he 2004 ) .",
    "our study has shown that scaling solutions not only fit the type ia supernova data much better than the basic @xmath33cdm cosmology , but they apparently simultaneously solve several conundrums with the standard model . as long as the time - averaged value of @xmath36 is less than @xmath131 ,",
    "they eliminate both the coincidence and flatness problems , possibly even obviating the need for a period of rapid inflation in the early universe ( see , e.g. , guth 1981 ; linde 1982 ) .    but most importantly , as far as this study is concerned , scaling solutions account very well for the observed fact that @xmath5 . if @xmath68 exactly , then @xmath108 for all cosmic time , and therefore the fact that we see this condition in the present universe is no coincidence at all . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath69 , scaling solutions fit the type ia supernova data even better , but then we have to accept the conclusion that the universe is older than the horizon time @xmath7 . according to our calculations , which produce a best fit to the supernova data for @xmath132 ( corresponding to a dark energy equation of state with @xmath119 ) , the age of the universe should then be @xmath133 billion years .",
    "this may be surprising at first , perhaps even unbelievable to some , but the fact of the matter is that such an age actually solves other major problems in cosmology , including the ( too ) early appearance of supermassive black holes , and the glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group of galaxies .",
    "when thinking about a dynamical dark energy , it is worth recalling that scalar fields arise frequently in particle physics , including string theory , and any of these may be appropriate candidates for this mysterious new component of @xmath13 . actually , though we have restricted our discussion to equations of state with @xmath134 , it may even turn out that a dark energy with @xmath135 is providing the universe s acceleration .",
    "such a field is usually referred to as a phantom or a ghost . the simplest explanation for this form of dark energy would be a scalar field with a negative kinetic energy ( caldwell 2002 ) .",
    "however , phantom fields are plagued by severe quantum instabilities , since their energy density is unbounded from below and the vacuum may acquire normal , positive energy fields ( carroll et al .",
    "we have therefore not included theories with @xmath135 in our analysis here , though a further consideration of their viability may be warranted as the data continue to improve .    on the observational front",
    ", the prospects for confirming or rejecting some of the ideas presented in this paper look very promising indeed .",
    "an eagerly anticipated mission , snap ( rhodes et al .",
    "2004 ) , will constrain the nature of dark energy in two ways .",
    "first , it will observe deeper type ia supernovae .",
    "second , it will attempt to use weak gravitational lensing to probe foreground mass structures .",
    "if selected , snap should be launched by 2020 .",
    "an already funded mission , the planck cmb satellite , probably wo nt have the sensitivity to measure any evolution in @xmath81 , but it may be able to tell us whether or not @xmath136 .",
    "an esa mission , planck is scheduled for launch in mid-2008 .    finally , we may be on the verge of uncovering a class of sources other than type ia supernovae to use for dark - energy exploration .",
    "type ia supernovae have greatly enhanced our ability to study the universe s expansion out to a redshift @xmath137 .",
    "but this new class of sources may possibly extend this range to values as high as @xmath138 . according to hooper and dodelson ( 2007 ) , gamma ray bursts ( grbs )",
    "have the potential to detect dark energy with a reasonable significance , particularly if there was an appreciable amount of it at early times , as suggested by scaling solutions .",
    "it is still too early to tell if grbs are good standard candles , but since differences between @xmath33cdm and dynamical dark energy scenarios are more pronounced at early times ( see figures  3 , 6 , and 9 ) , grbs may in the long run turn out to be even more important than type ia supernovae in helping us learn about the true nature of this unexpected  third \" form of energy .",
