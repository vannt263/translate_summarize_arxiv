    "@xcite have observed a superfluid - mott insulator transition for @xmath7rb atoms , trapped in a three - dimensional optical - lattice potential , by changing the strength of the onsite potential .",
    "experiments in such optical lattices have several advantages over their condensed - matter counterparts , including precise knowledge of the underlying microscopic models  @xcite , the possibility of controlling parameters in the effective lattice hamiltonians , and the absence of disorder .",
    "the recent probable observation of a supersolid helium phase  @xcite has given a further fillip to this area . even in the absence of disorder",
    "these systems can show a variety of phases like superfluid ( sf ) , mott insulator ( mi ) , and mass density wave ( mdw ) [ or charge density wave ( cdw ) if the bosons are charged ] .",
    "the simplest model that can show these phases is the extended bose - hubbard model whose hamiltonian is @xmath8 the first term in eq .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the physically relevant region @xmath15 and set the scale of energies by using @xmath16",
    ".    model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) has been studied by a number of authors  @xcite in the case @xmath17 , i.e. , in the absence of nearest - neighbor interactions ; at zero temperature ( @xmath18 ) it has been shown to have a superfluid phase if the mean number of bosons per site @xmath19 is not an integer ; however , for integer densities , it shows a superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) transition .",
    "this sf - mi transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type  @xcite in one dimension  @xcite .    in the limit @xmath20 model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) maps onto the spin-@xmath21 xxz model if the mean number of bosons per site @xmath22 .",
    "every site can now have only two possible states , namely , a state with no boson and another with one boson .",
    "we represent these as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and make the identification @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , spin-@xmath21 down and up states .",
    "now , by using the transformations @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , the model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) maps onto the spin-@xmath21 xxz model with the hamiltonian @xmath32 where we have suppressed constant terms . this model has been solved exactly  @xcite and shows a kt - type transition from xy to ising ordering at @xmath33 .",
    "the bosonic analogs of xy and ising phases are , respectively , sf and mdw phases .    if @xmath1 and @xmath34 , it is easy to see that model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) has a first - order , mi - mdw transition at @xmath35 .",

    "we obtain the phase diagram here for density @xmath38 by using the fsdmrg method which , as we show below , gives very accurate results for the nature of ordering in the different phases and the types and universality classes of the transitions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of integer density ( @xmath1 ) since we want to explore the competition between sf , mdw , and mi phases .",
    "we note in passing that , even for @xmath17 , the bose - hubbard model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) can not be solved exactly unlike its fermionic counterpart ; and for the fermionic case too there has been renewed interest in the phase diagram of the extended hubbard model  @xcite .    before proceeding further we give a brief summary of our results .",
    "our fsdmrg phase diagram for model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) , with @xmath0 and @xmath38 , is given in the @xmath39 plane of fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "it consists of three phases ; superfluid ( sf ) , mott insulator ( mi ) and mass density wave ( mdw ) . for small values of the interactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the sf phase dominates as is to be expected since the bosons interact weakly here .",
    "however , as the interaction strengths increase , either mi or mdw phases get stabilized .",
    "the former dominates when @xmath3 is much larger than @xmath4 , whereas the latter dominates if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both large and comparable : a large , repulsive @xmath4 disfavors a phase with a uniform density of bosons on nearest - neighbor sites ; instead , an mdw phase , with a periodic variation of the boson density , is stabilized .",
    "the lattice we consider is bipartite and has two sublattices a and b ( say odd - numbered and even - numbered sites ) ; the ground state in the mdw phase is , therefore , doubly degenerate since the peaks in the mass - density wave can lie either on the a or the b sublattice .",
    "if the bosons are charged this mdw phase is a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase . by using the fsdmrg method we have determined the phase boundaries between these phases . the mi - sf phase boundary in fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) lies in the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) universality class , whereas the mdw - sf phase boundary has both kt and two - dimensional - ising characters . for large values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",

    "we do not consider the shaded region @xmath40 . ]",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains the details of our finite - size density - matrix renormalization group ( fsdmrg ) calculation .",
    "section iii contains our results .",
    "we end with concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "the finite - size density - matrix renormalization group ( fsdmrg ) method has proven to be very useful in studies of one - dimensional quantum systems  @xcite . to make this paper self - contained we summarize the salient points of this method .",
    "open boundary conditions are preferred for such calculations since the loss of accuracy with increasing system size is much less than in the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the conventional fsdmrg method consists of the following two steps :    1 .",
    "the infinite - system density - matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) , where we start with a system with four sites , add two sites at each step of the iteration , and continue till we obtain a system with the desired number @xmath41 of sites ( in most of our calculations we use @xmath42 but , in some representative cases , we have gone up to @xmath43 ) .",
    "2 .   the finite - system method in which the system size @xmath41 is held fixed , but the energy of a target state is improved iteratively by a sweeping procedure , described below , till convergence is obtained .    for a model like eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) we first construct the hamiltonian matrix of the superblock configuration @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent left- and right - block hamiltonians , respectively , and each one of the @xmath47 represents a single - site hamiltonian . in the first step of the dmrg iteration",
    "both @xmath45 and @xmath46 also represent single sites , so , at this step , we have a four - site chain .",
    "we now diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix of the superblock and obtain the energy and the eigenfunction of a _",
    "target state_. in our study the target state is the ground state of the system of size @xmath41 with either @xmath48 or @xmath49 bosons .",
    "the latter is required for obtaining the gap in the energy spectrum .",
    "we now divide the superblock into two equal halves , the left and the right parts , which are treated , respectively , as the _ system _ and the _ universe_. the density matrix for this _ system _ , namely , @xmath50 , is calculated from the _ target state_. if we write the _ target state _ as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the basis states of the _ system _ and the _ universe _ , then the density matrix for the _ system _ has elements @xmath54 . the eigenvalues of this density matrix measure the weight of each of its eigenstates in the _ target state_. the optimal states for describing the _ system _ are the ones with the largest eigenvalues of the associated density matrix . in this first step of the dmrg the superblock , and",
    "hence the dimension of the density matrix , is small , so all the states can be retained .",
    "however , in subsequent steps , when the sizes of the superblocks and density matrices increase , only the most significant states are retained , say the ones corresponding to the largest @xmath55 eigenvalues of the density matrix ( in our studies we choose @xmath56 ) .",
    "we then obtain the effective hamiltonian for the _ system _ @xmath57 in the basis of the significant eigenstates of the density matrix ; this is used in turn as the left block for the next dmrg iteration .",
    "in the same manner we obtain the effective hamiltonian for the right block , i.e. , @xmath58 . in the next step of the dmrg",
    "we construct the hamiltonian matrix for the superblock @xmath59 , so the size of the system increases from @xmath60 to @xmath61 . for a system of size @xmath41",
    ", we continue , as in the first step , by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix for the configuration @xmath62 and setting @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the next step of the dmrg iteration .",
    "thus at each step of the dmrg iteration the left and right blocks increase in length by one site and the total length @xmath41 of the chain increases by @xmath65 .    in the infinite - system dmrg method outlined above the left- and right - block bases",
    "are not optimized in the following sense : the dmrg estimate for the target - state energy , at the step when the length of the system is @xmath41 , is not as close to the exact value of the target - state energy for this system size as it can be .",
    "it has been found that the fsdmrg method overcomes this problem  @xcite . in this method",
    "we first use the infinite - system dmrg iterations to build up the system to a certain desired size @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath41-site superblock configuration is now given by @xmath66 . in the next step of the fsdmrg method , the superblock configuration @xmath67 , which clearly keeps the system size fixed at @xmath41 , is used .",
    "this step is called _ sweeping _ in the right direction since it increases ( decreases ) the size of the left ( right ) block by one site . for this superblock",
    "the _ system _ is @xmath68 , the _ universe _ is @xmath69 , the associated density matrix can be found , and from its most significant states the new effective hamiltonian for the left block , with @xmath70 sites , is obtained .",
    "we sweep again , in this way , to obtain a left block with @xmath71 sites and so on till the left block has @xmath72 sites and the right block has 1 site so that , along with the two sites in between these blocks , the system still has size @xmath41 ; or , if a preassigned convergence criterion for the target - state energy is satisfied , this sweeping can be terminated earlier . note that , in these sweeping steps , for the right block we need @xmath46 to @xmath73 , which we have already obtained in earlier steps of the infinite - system dmrg .",
    "next we sweep leftward : the size of the left ( right ) block decreases ( increases ) by one site at each step . furthermore , in each of the right- and left- sweeping steps , the energy of the target state decreases systematically till it converges ( we use a six - figure convergence criterion in our calculations ) .",
    "we use a slightly modified form of the fsdmrg method in which we sweep , as described above , at _ every step _ of the dmrg scheme and not only in the one that corresponds to the largest value of @xmath41 .",
    "this helps in obtaining accurate @xmath74 functions which we use to obtain critical exponents ( see below ) at continuous transitions .",
    "furthermore , since the superfluid phase in models such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) , in @xmath0 and at @xmath18 , is critical and has a correlation length that diverges with the system size @xmath41 , finite - size effects must be removed by using finite - size scaling as we show below . for this purpose , the energies and correlation functions , obtained from a dmrg calculation , should have converged properly for each system size @xmath41 .",
    "it is important , therefore , that we use the fsdmrg method as opposed to the infinite - system dmrg method especially in the vicinities of continuous phase transitions .",
    "we find that convergence , to a specified accuracy for the target - state energy , is faster in the mi phase than in the sf phase .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : fsdmrg ] ) shows , at a representative point in the sf phase of fig .",
    "( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) , how the percentage disagreement between dmrg and fsdmrg ground - state energies increases with @xmath41 in our calculations .",
    "the percentage difference between the ground state energies @xmath75 obtained by dmrg and fsdmrg methods , for a representative point in the sf phase of fig  ( [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) , plotted as a function of @xmath41 . ]",
    "since the bases of left- and right - block hamiltonians are truncated by neglecting the eigenstates of the density matrix corresponding to small eigenvalues , this leads to truncation errors .",
    "if we retain @xmath55 states , the density - matrix weight of the discarded states is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the eigenvalues of density matrix .",
    "@xmath78 provides a convenient measure of the truncation errors .",
    "we find that these errors depend on the order - parameter correlation length in a phase .",
    "for a fixed @xmath55 , we find very small truncation errors in the mi and mdw phases ; these grow as the mi - sf and mdw - sf transitions are approached ; and the truncation errors are largest in the sf phase . in our calculations",
    "we choose @xmath55 such that the truncation error is always less than @xmath79 ; we find that @xmath56 suffices .",
    "the number of possible states per site in the bose - hubbard model is infinite since there can be any number of bosons on a site . in a practical dmrg calculation",
    "we must restrict the number @xmath80 of states or bosons allowed per site .",
    "the smaller the interaction parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the larger must @xmath80 be .",
    "as in earlier calculations  @xcite on related models , we find that @xmath81 is sufficient for the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 considered here ; we have checked in representative cases that our results do not change significantly if @xmath82 .    in summary ,",
    "then , our fsdmrg procedure gives us the energy @xmath83 for the ground state of model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) and the associated eigenstate @xmath84 .",
    "given these we can calculate the energy gaps , order parameters , and correlation functions that characterize all the phases of this model and thence the phase diagram .",
    "we discuss this in section iii .",
    "the single - particle energy gap @xmath85 for a system of size @xmath41 , the order parameter for the mdw phase , and the correlation functions that characterize sf and mdw phases in model  ( [ eq : ebhmodel ] ) can be defined in a straightforward manner in terms of the energies and wavefunctions mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the energy gap is @xmath86 where @xmath83 is the ground - state energy for a system of size @xmath41 with @xmath87 bosons ; since we are interested in studying the case @xmath1 , we increase the number of bosons by 2 at every dmrg step in which 2 sites are added to the system ( sec .",
    "ii ) so that @xmath88 .",
    "we expect , and show explicitly below , that this gap is positive in both mi and mdw phases , which are incompressible insulators , but it vanishes in the sf phase , which is compressible .",
    "the correlation function that characterizes the sf phase is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the ground - state wavefunction of the system with size @xmath41 and @xmath87 bosons .",
    "the associated correlation length can be obtained from the second moment of this correlation function , namely , @xmath91^{1/2 } .",

    "the mdw phase can be differentiated from the mi phase by using the order parameter for the mdw phase @xmath94 and the associated correlation function @xmath95 the correlation length for mdw ordering @xmath96 can be defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrlensf ] ) but with @xmath97 instead of @xmath98 .",
    "it is useful first to discuss the case @xmath99 .",

    "the appearance of the sf phase is signaled by the divergence of the correlation length @xmath100 . for a finite system",
