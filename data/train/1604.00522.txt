    "magnetic domain walls ( dws ) in patterned nanostrips have attracted much attention due to their application in field- and current - induced dw logic@xcite and memory devices  @xcite .",
    "key to the successful operation of these memory devices is the controllable motion of dws between pinning sites using current pulses , which contrary to the field - driven case , will coherently drive neighboring walls in the same direction through the nanostrip .",
    "experiments have shown that the injection of an electrical current through a soft permalloy ( py ) strip can drive domain walls in the direction of the electron flow @xcite and/or assist the field - driven depinning from a patterned constriction@xcite .",
    "dw transformations@xcite , and even the nucleation of multiple walls @xcite have also been observed under injection of current pulses .",
    "these observations are usually interpreted in terms of the spin - transfer torque ( stt ) mechanism , as predicted by berger and slonczewski@xcite .",
    "since the electrical current becomes spin - polarized in the magnetic direction of the ferromagnet , the polarization of the spin flips when a dw is encountered . because of angular momentum conservation , this change in angular momentum of the conduction electrons leads to a reaction torque on the dw called adiabatic stt , and the dw is pushed in the direction of the electron flow .",
    "in addition to this torque , a second , non adiabatic stt was suggested@xcite to explain the discrepancies with the experimental results .",
    "the common interpretation is that the spin polarization of the electric current can not follow the local magnetization within the dw , and a misalignment between the current and the dw magnetization occurs , which acts as an additional field - like torque on the dw .",
    "this torque is parametrized by the so - called non adiabatic parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , the physical origin , as well as the magnitude of this non adiabatic stt contribution , remains controversial to this day@xcite .",
    "the debate is reinforced by the high disparity of the estimated stt parameters , spin polarization @xmath2 and nonadiabaticity @xmath1 , as deduced from experiments on similar py samples ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". therefore , a complete understanding of these observations is lacking , and further theoretical and numerical efforts are still needed .",
    "a typical design for measuring the stt parameters consists of analysing the depinning of a dw initially trapped at a notch . in the absence of current",
    ", the dw can be expelled from the notch under a sufficiently large static magnetic field .",
    "since the non - adiabatic contribution enters in the magnetization dynamics equation as an effective magnetic field@xcite , the stt parameters ( @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) can be inferred by measuring the reduction or the enhancement of the required field as a function of the injected current .",
    "the experimental results of critical depinning current as a function of the applied field ( or vice versa ) are usually described in terms of standard micromagnetic and/or simple @xmath3 models , which describe the dw dynamics governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation including the adiabatic and nonadiabatic stts . however , these conventional approaches assume that the current density is flowing uniformly along the strip@xcite .",
    "this constitutes an oversimplification when the strip cross section is non - uniform , and especially when the current is forced to pass through constrictions .",
    "apart from the stts , it is well known that an electric current also generates joule heating .",
    "although several experimental works have indicated that its effect can be significant  @xcite , its influence on dw depinning has not yet been assessed .",
    "reductions in the dw propagation field  @xcite or in the switching field  @xcite have been experimentally observed in py samples and ascribed to joule heating .",
    "furthermore , numerical studies@xcite of the heat transport in these systems have shown that non - uniform temperature profiles can appear during the current pulse and that , depending on the current and the substrate , the local temperature can be close to or even above the curie temperature ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "although thermal fluctuations at uniform room temperature have been studied numerically with the stochastic version of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation@xcite , this langevin approach is restricted to uniform temperatures well below the curie threshold , and therefore it fails to describe the current - assisted dw depinning in systems where the temperature varies significantly .",
    "here we develop a micromagnetic framework that couples both the electric and the heat transport to the magnetization dynamics self - consistently . within this formalism",
    ", the magnetization dynamics is described by the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation@xcite , which allows us to properly describe the current - assisted dw depinning for temperatures close to or even above @xmath4 .    as an archetypal experiment ,",
    "the developed formalism is used here to numerically evaluate the phase diagram for current - assisted dw depinning studied experimentally by hayashi et al.@xcite .",
    "this experiment was performed on a @xmath5-long py nanostrip on top of a @xmath0 substrate .",
    "the py strip has a @xmath6 cross section and contains a triangular notch with a depth of @xmath7 .",
    "four different initial magnetic dw configurations pinned at the notch were observed , depending on the nucleation process : vortex or transverse dws , pinned at the center or at the left side of the notch ( see fig . 2 in@xcite for a detailed description of the nucleation process ) .",
    "after nucleation and pinning of dws , @xmath8 current pulses with both polarities ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) of different amplitudes were applied through two gold contacts placed at a distance of @xmath11 from each other under bias static fields @xmath12 along the longitudinal @xmath13-axis .",
    "a sketch of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) . after each current pulse , the presence or absence of the dw between the contacts was detected by resistance measurements , and the probability of current - assisted dw depinning was obtained as a function of the external field .",
    "the critical depinning current was defined as the one at which depinning probability exceeds @xmath14 .",
    "as expected , in the absence of current pulses ( @xmath15 ) , the dws initially trapped at the center of the notch were symmetrically depinned by positive ( @xmath16 ) and negative ( @xmath17 ) fields with the same magnitude . by contrast , the dws pinned at the left side of the notch are more easily depinned by negative fields than by positive fields , simply because of the asymmetric pinning potential@xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of current pulses ( @xmath18 ) , two noticeable results can be observed in the measured depinning diagrams shown in fig .",
    "3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "first , dw depinning is not achieved in the absence of an applied field , and therefore , the evaluated currents alone do not exert a significant force on the dws .",
    "second , regardless of the initial magnetic configuration , all phase diagrams show a marginal dependence on the current polarity , i.e. positive ( @xmath9 ) and negative ( @xmath10 ) currents produce roughly the same phase diagram .",
    "these observations are not fully compatible with pure stt contributions@xcite , which push the dw in opposite directions , depending on current polarity .",
    "by contrast , they suggest that the experimental results could be compatible with joule heating ( jh ) , which does not depend on the current polarity .",
    "in fact , hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite estimated an averaged temperature through the sample of about @xmath19 during the injection of the pulses with @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : moviessnap ] ( c ) ) . once the current pulse is switched off ( @xmath100 ) ,",
    "the ferromagnetic order is recovered as @xmath101 relaxes back to uniform room temperature , as described in fig .",

    "this re - nucleation process is influenced by the shape anisotropy and the static applied field .",
    "the ferromagnetic order is not destroyed outside the region between the contacts because no current has flowed there .",
    "these outside regions preserve a quasi - uniform magnetization pointing in opposite directions along the @xmath13-axis and , as a consequence , a dw is forced to be re - nucleated between the contacts for @xmath170 .",
    "note that once the dw is out of the notch , it also undergoes a local pinning due to the edge roughness , which generates a minimum dw propagation field along the strip of @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , depending on the applied field , the re - nucleated dw can finally be expelled from the contact area , resulting in a depinning event .",
    "the absence of points for @xmath172 is precisely due to this propagation field . in agreement with the experimental results ,",
    "no dw depinning is achieved in the absence of external field .",
    "the emergence of multiple - domains states , as consequence of re - nucleation due to joule heating above @xmath117 , was also observed experimentally in other studies on py strips  @xcite . here due to the reduced dimensions and the sides effect , we mainly observe one re - nucleated dw .",
    "coming back to our system , for @xmath173 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moviessnap](b ) ) , the average temperature between the contacts is @xmath174 while the local temperature in the notch is larger than the curie threshold ( @xmath175 ) . in this case",
    ", the destruction of the ferromagnetic order occurs only around the notch position , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5_msnapt](a ) at @xmath176 and in the corresponding movie ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moviessnap](b ) ) .",
    "after the pulse , dw is re - nucleated under the notch but adopts a different internal structure , the new structure can either be a displaced transverse ( or vortex ) wall or a meta - stable state which then collapses into a transverse or vortex wall .",
    "an example of this after - effect configuration is shown in the transient magnetization states of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5_msnapt ] at @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "note the meta - stable state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5_msnapt]b .",
    "the new dw is found to have a lower depinning field and it is eventually depinned from the notch .",
    "we found a new critical depinning field for the re - nucleated dw of about @xmath179 .",
    "this decrease in the depinning field can be attributed to the new dw structure and the complex re - nucleation process ( note that the re - nucleation takes place under the effect of the bias field and can involve transitions from meta - stable states ) .",
    "since these results clearly indicate a remarkable influence of joule heating in current - assisted dw depinning , it is interesting to evaluate the magnetization dynamics coupled to the heat transport in the absence of stts ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "this case is depicted by green diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4_phased_llb ] .",
    "these latter results are very close to those observed in the presence of stts ( blue circles and red squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4_phased_llb ] ) .",
    "consequently , we can state that stts do not play a dominant role for @xmath180 .",
    "by contrast , for such high currents , joule heating and the applied field are the main agents responsible for the dw depinning events . for lower currents ( @xmath181 ) , where dw depinning is mainly achieved because of the applied field , the contribution of the stts is also small , as can be deduced by considering the similarity of the results with and without stts in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4_phased_llb ] .",
    "as previously commented , temperature is coupled to the magnetization dynamics through the thermal fields and the temperature dependence of the magnetic parameters . however , by simulating the dw depinning without thermal fields ( eq .  [ eq : thfield ] ) we found that thermal fluctuations effect is negligible .",
    "indeed we obtained almost the same depinning diagram even without the random thermal fields .",
    "the main actor is therefore the temperature dependence of the micromagnetic parameters , which is indeed responsible for the destruction of the ferromagnetic order and the previously described depinning events at high currents . however , even at @xmath133 , temperature can significantly affect the depinning field . by performing purely field driven depinning simulations at constant uniform temperature",
    ", we found that the depinning field changes with @xmath128 as @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the depinning field at @xmath155 .",
    "this means that temperature is actually decreasing the pinning barrier .",
    "such behaviour is due to exchange and magnetostatic energies which scale as @xmath184 and give rise to the pinning barrier . since the zeeman energy scales as @xmath122 , the resulting depinning field ( defined as the field at which the zeeman energy is equal to the energy barrier ) scales as @xmath122 .",
    "note that this behaviour is true for a system at constant and uniform temperature but , in our case , time- and space - dependent temperature patterns can lead to further pinning and the behaviour of the depinning field might be more complicated .",
    "the analysis performed at constant uniform temperature simply help us to understand one of the possible effect of the temperature rise .",
    "experimental observations ( in uniform py strips ) of decreases in the dw propagation field  @xcite or in the switching field  @xcite due to joule heating , can be explained by the same mechanism , as already anticipated in ref .",
    "@xcite note also that even if temperature effects can be divided into these two contributions ( thermal noise and temperature dependence of the micromagnetic parameters ) at a micromagnetic level , from a more fundamental and microscopic point of view , all of them are related to thermal agitation of single spins . finally , although it is not the main objective of the present study , it is interesting to comment about one of the main results of hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite which is the independence of the critical depinning current on the dw type ( transverse or vortex ) at low fields ( high currents ) . our analysis ,",
    "although performed only one dw type , points out , in agreement with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , that such independence might be due to thermal effects which overcome the stts and are indeed independent on the dw type .",
    "and @xmath185 at @xmath103 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 . the detail in ( b )",
    "represents a meta - stable state formed after re - nucleation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the current - assisted dw depinning from a notch in a permalloy strip on top of a silicon substrate has been evaluated under static fields and short current pulses .",
    "the non - uniform spatial distribution of the current due to the notch results in significant non - uniform temperature profiles through the sample . owing to joule heating",
    ", the temperature can reach values close to or even above the curie point for commonly injected currents in typical experiments .",
    "although significant joule heating have been observed in experimental studies , its effect has been overlooked in the theoretical descriptions . here",
    ", we have developed a formalism to properly describe the magnetization dynamics coupled to the heat transport .",
    "in particular , the depinning diagrams of the critical depinning current as a function of the applied field were experimentally found to be insensitive to the current polarity in the system under study , an observation which is not compatible with the sole contribution of the spin transfer torques .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that indeed joule heating is crucial to reproduce these experimental observations  @xcite . in agreement with previous studies",
    "@xcite , the temperature evolution of the strip strongly depends on the current amplitude and the substrate . below the notch , temperature is much higher than the average value .",
    "the rise in temperature leads to an increase in thermal agitation and in a reduction of the depinning field .",
    "moreover , under typically injected current pulses , joule heating can lead to a local destruction of the ferromagnetic order during which the dw is destroyed and the re - nucleated with a different internal structure ( vortex , transverse or a meta - stable state ) and a lower depinning field .",
    "our findings suggest that previous estimations of stt parameters based on depinning experiments , performed by fitting the experimental data with conventional micromagnetic and/or 1d models at constant and uniform temperature , must be carefully considered in systems where joule heating is relevant .",
    "in addition , the formalism introduced here can be used to study the interplay between stt and thermal gradients in systems where the temperature changes dynamically .",
