    "the intriguing properties of silicon along with its technological importance have stimulated intensive theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work .",
    "its high - density forms include the semiconducting and covalent crystalline and amorphous phases and the metallic liquid phase . upon melting it undergoes a semiconductor - metal transition , a density increase of @xmath0 10% and significant changes in the local structure which evolves from an open one , with a tetrahedral fourfold coordination , to a liquid structure with @xmath0 sixfold coordination",
    ". in crystalline si ( c - si ) the semiconducting diamond structure contracts with pressure and transforms at 12 gpa @xcite to the metallic white - tin structure and then to the metallic simple hexagonal structure at 16 gpa @xcite .",
    "the local structure of liquid si ( l - si ) at the triple point ( tp ) is somewhat similar to high - pressure forms of c - si , and it has been suggested that l - si might consist of a mixture of diamond - type and white - tin - type structures with the proportion of the latter increasing with pressure .    within this backdrop , funamori and tsuji @xcite have recently carried out x - ray ( xr ) diffraction experiments to determine the static structure of l - si at pressures of 4 , 8 , 14 and 23 gpa and temperatures about 50 k above the melting point at the pressure . from an analysis of the static structure factors @xmath1 and",
    "the associated pair distribution functions @xmath2 , funamori and tsuji @xcite concluded that l - si up to 8 gpa has a local structure intermediate between the diamond - type and the white - tin - type .",
    "but , between 8 and 14 gpa drastic structural changes were noted with l - si transforming to a denser structure similar to that of l - sn at ambient pressure as evinced by the strong similarities between the @xmath1 s of l - sn and l - si at 14 gpa .",
    "prompted by these experimental developments , we have performed an _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) study of several static and dynamic properties of compressed l - si at the thermodynamic states addressed by funamori and tsuji @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the reflection of the reported structural changes in the dynamic properties .",
    "our aimd method is based on density functional theory @xcite ( dft ) which , for given nuclear positions , allows the calculation of the ground state electronic energy and yields the forces on the nuclei via the hellmann - feynman theorem , enabling md simulations in which the nuclear positions evolve according to classical mechanics whereas the electronic subsystem follows adiabatically .",
    "most aimd methods are based on the kohn - sham ( ks ) form of dft ( ks - aimd methods ) which treats the electron kinetic energy exactly , but which at present , poses heavy computational demands limiting the size of the systems to be studied as well as the simulation times .",
    "some of these constraints can be relaxed by the so - called orbital - free _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( of - aimd ) method , which approximates the electron kinetic energy but disposes of the electronic orbitals of the ks formulation .",
    "the method allows simulations in which the number of variables describing the electronic state is greatly reduced so that larger samples ( several hundreds of particles ) can be studied for longer simulation times ( tens of ps ) .",
    "theoretical studies of l - si have mainly focused on static structural properties for thermodynamic states near the tp .",
    "most studies were classical md simulations using effective interatomic potentials constructed either empirically by fitting to experimental data @xcite or derived from some approximate theoretical model .",
    "recently , ks - aimd calculations @xcite have been reported which address electronic and static properties . stich _",
    "et al _ @xcite and chelikowsky _ et al _ @xcite have reported ks - aimd calculations for l - si for 64 particles , using non - local pseudopotentials and the local density approximation .",
    "a subsequent calculation @xcite used 350 particles and an improved treatment of electron exchange and correlation .",
    "recently , we have carried out an of - aimd simulation @xcite for l - si near the tp for 2000 particles using a first principles local pseudopotential .",
    "both static and dynamic properties were calculated with results in good agreement with the available experimental data , supporting the validity of the of - aimd for treating systems such as l - si which show some remnants of covalent bonding and are not fully metallic .    on the experimental side ,",
    "besides the aforementioned xr experiments of funamori and tsuji @xcite , we also quote the availability of both neutron scattering ( ns ) @xcite and x - ray ( xr ) @xcite diffraction data as well as the recent inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) data of hosokawa _ et al _ @xcite which have provided information on the dynamic structure of l - si near tp .    in the next section",
    "the orbital - free _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics ( of - aimd ) scheme is described briefly with emphasis on the electronic kinetic energy functional and the local pseudopotential used to characterize the electron - ion interaction . in section [ results ] the results of the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations for several static and dynamic properties are presented and compared with the available experimental data .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn and ideas for further improvements are suggested .",
    "the of - aimd method used in this study is described fully in earlier work @xcite , and has previously been used to study l - si near the tp @xcite . in summary ,",
    "an explicit density functional for the electronic energy is minimized iteratively for each ion configuration , the forces on the ions are found using the hellman - feynman theorem and the ion positions and velocities are updated by solving newton s equations .",
    "the approximate electron kinetic energy functional which correctly gives the thomas - fermi and linear response limits is based on the von weizscker term plus a correction which uses an averaged density @xcite .",
    "the local electron - ion pseudopotential was constructed , for each thermodynamic state , according to the procedure described in reference @xcite .",
    "simulations have been performed for l - si in the four thermodynamic states listed in table [ states ] .",
    "these correspond to pressures of 4 , 8 , 14 and 23 gpa and temperatures about 50 k above the melting point for each pressure @xcite .",
    "each simulation used 2000 ions in a cubic cell with periodic boundary conditions and size appropriate for the ionic number density , @xmath3 .",
    "the square root of the electron density was expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff energy @xmath4 ryd .",
    "the verlet leapfrog algorithm with a timestep of @xmath5 ps was used to update the ion positions and velocities .",
    "equilibration lasted 10 ps . and",
    "the calculation of properties was made averaging over a further 65 ps . for comparison , we mention that the ks - aimd simulations for l - si near the tp lasted 1.2 ps .",
    "@xcite 0.9 ps . @xcite and 1.0 ps .",
    "@xcite , which precludes its application to the study of most dynamical properties .",
    "several liquid static properties were evaluated during the simulation : pair distribution function , static structure factor and bond angle distribution , as well as various dynamic properties , both single - particle ones : velocity autocorrelation function , mean square displacement , and collective ones : intermediate scattering functions , dynamic structure factors , longitudinal and transverse currents .",
    "the calculation of the time correlation functions ( cf ) was performed by taking time origins every five time steps .",

    "this relation has often been used on an atomic scale to estimate @xmath10 by identifying @xmath9 with the position , @xmath13 , of the main peak in @xmath2 . using the @xmath8 values for 4 , 8 , 14 and 23",

    "substitution into equation ( [ ztmc ] ) of the of - aimd results for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath22 allows identification of longitudinal and transverse current contributions : @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the two contributions are plotted in figure [ vacft4x4 ] which shows that the oscillatory behaviour in the @xmath25 is due to @xmath23 , but again the step from 8 to 14 gpa changes the shape of both contributions .",
    "up to 8 gpa , @xmath24 remains positive for all times as a result of the positive nature of @xmath26 ( see figures [ ctqtw1253]-[ctqtw1093 ] ) and determines the long time behaviour of the @xmath25 , however , from 14 gpa on , @xmath24 develops a shallow and broad negative minimum centered at rather long times @xmath0 0.15 ps . on the other hand , @xmath23 accounts for most of the backscattering effect . with higher pressure the first minimum sharpens and moves to shorter times and the oscillations extend further , which are results of the increasing role of the `` cage '' effect . at 14 and 23",
    "gpa , both components are similar in shape to their liquid simple metals counterparts @xcite with both oscillating about zero and with @xmath23 controlling the large @xmath27 behaviour of @xmath25 .",
    "finally , notice that the development of the deep minimum in the @xmath25 is mainly due to the rapid decay of @xmath24 with increasing pressure .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse components of the power spectrum , @xmath28 , are shown in figure [ vacfw4x4 ] .",
    "the spectrum at small @xmath29 is dominated by @xmath30 , and , consequently , the diffusion constant @xmath31 is completely determined by the transverse component . for 4 and 8 gpa",
    ", @xmath30 decreases monotonously but at 14 and 23 gpa the value at zero frequency has dropped and a low - frequency peak has developed .",
    "note that @xmath30 has no maximum for 4 and 8 gpa which are the states where the @xmath32 shows , either no inelastic peaks ( 4 gpa ) or they exist for a small range ( 8 gpa ) .",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath33 always exhibits a peak whose position increases slightly with increasing pressure .",
    "this peak is responsible for the shoulder in the total @xmath28 for the 4 and 8 gpa states , as well as for the high - frequency peak for the 14 and 23 gpa states .    by a time ft of the @xmath22",
    "we obtain its frequency spectrum , @xmath34 , which is known as the self - dynamic structure factor and is related to the incoherent part of the measured ins cross - section . for all @xmath35-values",
    "@xmath36 decays monotonically as a function of frequency and can be characterized in terms of the peak value , @xmath37 and the hwhm , @xmath38 .",
    "these parameters are frequently reported normalized with respect to the hydrodynamic ( @xmath35 @xmath39 0 ) limit , by introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 can be interpreted as an effective @xmath35-dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath43 . for a simple liquid near its tp , @xmath44 usually oscillates whereas in a dense gas it decreases monotonically from unity at @xmath35 = 0 to the @xmath45 behaviour at large @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "figures [ delta4]-[sigma4 ] depict the of - aimd results for @xmath44 and @xmath46 for 8 and 14 gpa , as this is the pressure range where both magnitudes undergo a substantive change .",
    "the obtained @xmath44 for 14 gpa shows an oscillatory shape with a minimum located at @xmath35 @xmath0 @xmath47 which can be traced back to structural features ( `` cage '' effect ) which somewhat hinder the motion of the ions and becomes more effective at @xmath35 @xmath0 @xmath47 where the wavelength is comparable to the size of the cage .",
    "conversely , that for 8 gpa resembles the situation of a dense gas where the `` cage '' effect becomes negligible leading to a net reduction of the diffusion coefficient @xcite and its associated @xmath46 , stands very close to that of the dense gas .",
    "an additional check on the reliability of these results may be provided by the mc theory @xcite which has already shown its capability to describe to experimental data for @xmath44 and @xmath46 in simple liquid metals @xcite at @xmath35 @xmath48 @xmath47 .",
    "specifically , the mc theory avers that at low-@xmath35 values    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in reference @xcite .",
    "the first term in equations ( [ modecp ] ) stands for the hydrodynamic result whereas the second one accounts for the coupling of mass diffusion and collective modes .",
    "calculated values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 have been used with equations [ modecp ] to obtain the points in figures [ delta4]-[sigma4 ] . for @xmath35 @xmath48 @xmath47 we observe that the mc theory fairly accounts for the of - aimd results , with an accuracy comparable to what has already been achieved in other liquid metals @xcite .",
    "consequently , the present results show the ability of the mc theory to describe the single particle dynamics ( and presumably the collective dynamics too ) in liquid systems encompassing a range of bonding and structure as that displayed by the compressed l - si .",
    "several static and dynamic properties of l - si at four high - pressure thermodynamic states have been investigated using orbital free _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics combined with a first - principles local pseudopotential .",
    "the study was motivated by experimental findings @xcite of significant structural changes in l - si when the pressure is increased from 4 to 23 gpa .",
    "the obtained results for the static structure qualitatively follow those trends unveiled by the experiment , namely the increase of the intensity and the position of the s(q ) s main peak , along with a progressive vanishing of its shoulder . other parameters such as the coordination number , isothermal compressibility , and the shape of the bond - angle distibution function provide further insight into the changes .",
    "overall , apart from a contraction with increasing pressure , the static structures of l - si at the tp , and at 4 and 8 gpa are very similar . above 8 gpa",
    "the system transforms to a denser more close packed structure typical of a liquid simple metal , with most change taking place between 8 and 14 gpa .",
    "the structural changes are also reflected in several dynamical properties .",
    "the calculated dynamic structure factors , @xmath54 , show collective density excitations over similar wavelength ranges , namely up to @xmath35 @xmath0 ( 3/5)@xmath47 , as those found for simple liquid metals at their tp .",
    "these density excitations are sound waves whose velocity increases with pressure , most steeply between 8 and 14 gpa .",
    "the dispersion relations of the excitations divide into two groups , one for l - si at its tp , 4 gpa and 8 gpa and another group for l - si at 14 and 23 gpa .",
    "the transverse current correlation also show evidence of the structural changes . below 4 gpa , its frequency spectra",
    "lack inelastic peaks indicating the absence of shear waves , but at 8 gpa clear inelastic peaks are already evident .    the calculated self - diffusion and shear viscosity transport coefficients are also affected by the structural changes occurring between 8 and 14 gpa .",
    "these transport coefficients can not be compared with experiment , but confidence in the calculated values is given by the good agreement with experimental values and/or other _ ab - initio _",
    "results for l - si and its tp .",
    "finally , we remark that the present results for the static and dynamic properties of compressed l - si underscore the capability of the of - aimd method to tackle liquid systems encompassing a range of bonding and structure which evolves from mild remnants of covalent bonding to a metallic one",
    ". moreover , further improvements in the present _ ab initio _ method are still possible and they necessarily will be focused on developing more accurate electron kinetic energy functionals and local ionic pseudopotentials .",
