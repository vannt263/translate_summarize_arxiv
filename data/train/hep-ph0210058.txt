    "the anomaly mediated as well as the gaugino mediated susy breaking are technically equivalent to the msugra case and will therefore not be treated explicitly again .    among the most exciting schemes rank superstring induced scenarios ( see e.g  @xcite and references therein ) . in this report a string effective field theory , based on orbifold compactification of the heterotic string , will be analyzed in which , though dominated by the vacuum expectation values of the dilaton field , supersymmetry breaking is also affected by the moduli fields .",

    "the bottom  up approach exhausts all experimental information to the maximal extent possible in the empirical reconstruction of the underlying supersymmetric theory at the high scale .",

    "this exploration of gut and planck scale physics by combining high precision with high energy in experiments at hadron and lepton colliders , is complemented by only a very small number of other methods , _ notabene _ proton decay , likely neutrino physics , textures of mass matrices , and cosmology . in all these individual approaches only scarce information on the underlying physical theoretical structures at the gut",

    "this feature has been compellingly demonstrated in the evolution of the three gauge couplings to the unification point in the minimal supersymmetric theory .",
    "such extrapolations are made possible by high - precision measurements of the low - energy parameters .",
    "the operation of the @xmath17 colliders lep and slc has been crucial in this context . in the near future an enormous extension of this area will be possible if measurements at lhc and prospective @xmath17 linear colliders are combined to draw , if realized in nature , a comprehensive high - precision picture of the supersymmetric particles and their interactions . based merely on measurements at low energies ,",
    "the parameters of the theory can be evolved to high scales by means of renormalization group techniques .",
    "supersymmetric theories and their breaking mechanisms have the simplest structures and the greatest regularities at high scales .",
    "extrapolations to high scales are therefore crucial to uncover the regularities . the bottom - up approach in the extrapolation of parameters measured at low scales to the high scales provides the most transparent picture . in this way the basis of the susy breaking mechanism can be explored and the crucial elements of the fundamental supersymmetric theory can be reconstructed .",
    "the method can thus be used to explore particle physics phenomena at a scale where , eventually , particle physics is linked to gravity .",
    "apart from other examples , we have focused on two interesting scenarios in this approach .",
    "the universality of gaugino and scalar mass parameters in minimal supergravity can be demonstrated very clearly if realized in the supersymmetric theory .",
    "small deviations from universality , on the other hand , may be exploited to measure the fundamental parameters in superstring effective field theories , i.e. the strength of dilaton and moduli fields , their mixing and the modular weights . in this way",
    ", high - precision extrapolations of gauge and supersymmetric parameters can establish direct contact between superstring theory and experiment .",
    "many more refinements of the theoretical calculations and future experimental analyses will be necessary to expand the picture we have drawn in this first attempt .",
