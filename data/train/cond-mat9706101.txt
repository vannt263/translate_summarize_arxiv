    "proteins are chiral heteropolymers , made out of twenty species of monomers ( aminoacids ) .",
    "natural proteins have the property of folding into an ( almost ) unique compact native structure , which is of biological interest @xcite .",
    "the compactness of this unique native state is largely due to the existence of an optimal amount of hydrophobic aminoacid residues @xcite , since these biological objects are usually designed to work in water .",
    "the existence of secondary structures @xcite plays a predominant role in the existence of the unique native state . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", one may either emphasize the heterogeneous character of these biopolymers @xcite , or choose to focus on the more crystalline - like secondary structures ( @xmath1-helices and @xmath2-sheets ) .",
    "in the first approach , folding is identified to a freezing transition ; in the second approach , that we follow in this paper , the folding transition is more like a gas - solid transition .",
    "previous studies along the latter path made use of simplified lattice models @xcite .",
    "we consider here a microscopic continuous model of a homopolymer chain , where each monomer carries a dipole moment .",
    "the rationale for this choice is clear if one interprets the chemist s hydrogen bonds as the interaction between electrostatic dipoles ( the secondary structures approximately corresponding to the classic dipole equilibrium positions ) .",
    "the dipolar moment of a @xmath3 is @xmath4d , yielding a typical dipolar temperature ( temperature below which dipolar effects become relevant ) of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative dielectric constant of the medium , and @xmath7 is a typical distance between dipoles .",
    "the electrostatics of proteins in water is a somewhat controversial issue @xcite , so we will content ourselves with an estimate of @xmath8 in the native state .",
    "it is then appropriate to take @xmath9 @xcite . with @xmath10 @xcite ,",
    "we find @xmath11 , so that dipolar effects may play a crucial role in the energetics of the folding ( or unfolding ) transition . the spatial range of the dipole - dipole interaction can be finite or infinite : its angular dependence ( or tensorial character ) is the crucial issue of this paper .",
    "to make a closer connexion with proteins , we assume that the dipole moments are constrained to be perpendicular to the chain . in this way",
    ", a monomer can be thought of as linking two successive @xmath12 carbon atoms , and its dipole moment represents the peptid @xmath3 dipole .",
    "a finite range of the dipolar interaction may further describe the finite range character of the hydrogen bonding interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model then reads @xmath13 in equation ( [ ham ] ) , @xmath14 is the inverse temperature , @xmath15 is the excluded volume , @xmath16 denotes the spatial position of monomer @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 its dipole moment . if necessary",
    ", three body repulsive interactions may be introduced , to avoid collapse at infinite density .",
    "the ( infinite range ) dipolar tensor reads @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a prefactor containing the dielectric constant of the medium . the dipolar interaction ( [ dipo ] )",
    "is cut - off at small distances ( @xmath23 ) and may also be cut - off at large distances by an exponential prefactor .",
    "the partition function of the model ( [ ham ] ) is given by : @xmath24 in equation ( [ partit ] ) , @xmath25 denotes the kuhn length of the monomers , and @xmath26 is the magnitude of their dipole moment .",
    "the third @xmath27-function restricts the dipole moment to be perpendicular to the chain ; this mimics the free rotation of the @xmath3 dipole around the @xmath28 `` virtual bond '' .",
    "as it stands , this partition function is not easy to evaluate . in particular the constraint of fixed length dipoles is not easy to implement .",
    "we have therefore studied the constrained dipolar chain in ( i ) in the framework of the virial expansion , with fixed length dipoles ( ii ) in the framework of a landau theory , where we replace the fixed dipole length by a gaussian distributed length .",
    "since the virial extension is quite familiar in the field of polymeric liquid crystals @xcite , we will be rather sketchy in our presentation .",

    "the free energy per monomer reads : [ free1 ] = du ( u ) ( ( u ) ) + v_0 2 - 1 2  du du ( u ) v ( u u ) ( u ) + o(^2 ) where ( u u ) = d r dp dp ( |p| -p_0 )   ( p u ) ( |p| -p_0 )   ( p u ) f ( r ) and the @xmath38 term in equation ( [ free1 ] ) represents the three body repulsive interactions . using the onsager variational form @xcite ( )",

    "since @xmath49 is a variational estimate , the true transition temperature is necessarily higher .",
    "these results show that dipolar interactions are responsible for both transitions .",
    "we remind the reader that they are expected to be correct at small monomer concentration , since they rely on the virial expansion . at higher monomer concentration",

    "an extension of this approach to chiral chains is possible @xcite . in this case",
    ", one expects to encounter a phase transition towards an inhomogeneous phase ( e.g. cholesteric ) at a temperature @xmath50 higher than @xmath49 .",
    "the possibility of a crossing between @xmath51 and @xmath50 must therefore be considered .",
    "as shown in the next section , the landau approach to the constrained dipolar chain provides a more convenient framework to study this possibility .",
    "at a qualitative level , experimental phase diagrams are usually in agreement with the landau theory of phase transitions . roughly speaking , this theory , which rests over the use of symmetry arguments ,",
    "may be summarized as follows    * \\(i ) one looks for an order parameter @xmath52 that describes the ordered phase(s ) at point @xmath53 .",

    "this theory clearly assumes that the order parameter @xmath52 varies on distances much larger than the microscopic length scales .",

    "so far , no approximations beside the assumption of a gaussian distributed length of the dipoles were made .",
    "we stress the fact that the number of independent variables @xmath63 is equal to six , since @xmath64 is a symmetric rank 2 tensor .",

    ", we easily recover the results of section [ sec : virial ] . for space dependent order parameters , the landau - ginzburg free energy density @xmath69 is defined by : [ partit6 ] z_l= ( r ) d q_(r ) e^- dr f_l(r ) it can be evaluated by    * \\(i ) performing a saddle point method on @xmath70 in equation ( [ partit5 ] ) and replacing @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 . *",

    "the various coefficients @xmath74 in ( [ landau ] ) can in principle be calculated using the method described above .",
    "in particular , the temperature @xmath51 is the same as that defined in section [ sec : virial ] and @xmath75 would be the nematic transition temperature if there was no cubic term in @xmath76 in equation ( [ landau ] ) .",
    "the observation that the backbone of proteins has chirality can be appreciated through the ramachandran plot @xcite .",

    "it is not easy to take chirality into account at a microscopic level @xcite , while it is so at a landau - like level @xcite , since then , only very general symmetry considerations matter .",
    "in particular , if the system is described by a tensor @xmath73 , the absence of inversion symmetry ensures that a new ( scalar ) invariant shows up in equation ( [ landau ] ) , namely [ chiral ] f_chiral(r)= d _ q__q _ where @xmath77 is a measure of the strength of the chirality and @xmath78 the antisymmetric third rank tensor .",
    "the full landau free energy density @xmath79 of the constrained dipolar chiral chain then reads [ full ] f_l^tot(r)=f_l(r)+f_chiral(r ) where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given respectively in equations ( [ landau ] ) and ( [ chiral ] ) .",

    ", we briefly summarize the existing state of the art for blue phases .",
    "in chiral systems , the blue phases ( bp ) may show up in a narrow temperature range ( @xmath84k ) between the simple cholesteric ( helical ) liquid cristal phase and the isotropic liquid .",
    "their theory is quite complicated @xcite ; their ordering is described by a symmetric rank 2 tensor which can , in some appropriate limits , be linked to the molecular orientations .",
    "so far two cristalline phases ( bp i , bp ii ) and one non - cristalline phase ( bp iii ) have been found .",
    "more complicated phases may exist when an electric field is present .",
    "the cristalline phases are characterized by a body centered ( bp i ) or simple cubic ( bp ii ) lattice .",
    "the unit cell contains of the order of @xmath85 molecules , so that the landau expansion may be a priori trustworthy .",
    "note that these cristalline structures are threaded by disclinations ( line defects of the molecular orientations ) .",
    "the non cristalline phase ( bp iii ) is of particular interest @xcite .",
    "it has the same macroscopic symmetry as the isotropic liquid , and the ( bp iii)-(isotropic liquid ) phase transition has a critical end point , much like the liquid - gas transition .",
    "furthermore , attempts have been made to describe this phase as resulting from an unstable localized mode ( see the references in @xcite ) , as opposed to an extended mode for the cristalline bp s .",
    "we will exhibit , in a simple way , the crossing between the @xmath0 ( uniform ) collapse temperature @xmath51 and the temperature @xmath83 below which a modulated order sets in .",
    "following references @xcite , we consider in equation ( [ full ] ) the appearance of helicoidal order in the tensor @xmath82 . at this point",
    ", it is perhaps useful to recall the reader that the various `` helices '' of this section are not the @xmath1-helices present in proteins .",
    "indeed , these `` helices '' are linked to the order parameter of equation ( [ q ] ) , and , as in all polymeric problems , it is difficult to deduce the chain configuration(s ) from the physical order parameter(s ) .",
    "the @xmath82 helicoidal order is described by : [ helixpara ] q_(r)=q_(z)=1  q  m_+1 2  q  n_(z ) where the matrices @xmath86 and @xmath87 are given by [ matr1 ] * m*= and [ matr2 ] * n*= where @xmath88 is the wave vector of the modulation .",
    "usual cholesteric order ( i.e. the `` uniaxial '' helix ) corresponds to @xmath89 , while the purely biaxial helix is described by @xmath90 .",
    "we insert this trial order parameter in equation ( [ full ] ) and get : [ helic ] f_l^tot(r)&= & a_0 ^ 2 2 ( ( r))^2 + a_2 2(t - t _ )   ^2 ( r ) + a_3 3 ^3 ( r ) + + & + & ( b_2 ( t - t_0)- c_1  ( r ) )  q^2 2-b_3 6  q^3 6 + b_4  q^424 + + & - & d^22 b_0  q^2  ^2 this free energy density is to be minimized with respect to @xmath91 and @xmath92 . of particular importance are the terms which couple the order parameters in ( [ full ] ) . with our choice of the order parameter @xmath93 , the first non zero term corresponds to the @xmath94 coefficient of equation ( [ landau ] ) .",
    "moreover , on physical grounds , this coefficient must be positive , since an increase of the density is expected to favor the appearance of a liquid crystal type of ordering .",
    "furthermore , the order in @xmath92 can be shown to be uniform ( @xmath95 ordering ) . due to the large number of coefficients in the free energy density ,",
    "it is appropriate to work with dimensionless quantities , and we shall follow the notations of reference @xcite . the rescaled total free energy per unit volume @xmath30 reads : [ rescaled ] f & = & 14 ( t - c ) q^2 -14 ^2 q^2 ^2 + & - & q^3 3 + q^4 + 12 t c^2 + c^3 with [ def ] q & = & 46  b_3 b_4  q , = 23  b_3 ^4/3 b_4 a_3 ^ 1/3  c , + t & = & 1 ( t - t_0 ) , t = ( t - t _ ) , + & = & 32  a_2 b_4 a_3 ^ 2/3 b_3 ^ 4/3 , = b_3 ^ 2 18  b_2 b_4 + & = & 18  k_0 ^ 2  b_4 b_0 b_3 ^ 2 , c_1 = b_3 ^ 2/3a_3 ^ 1/3 12  , and _",
    "l^tot = ( 3 2)^3 b_4 ^ 3 b_3 ^ 4 f , we just quote here the conclusions of a study of equation ( [ rescaled ] ) .",
    "technical details will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram can be studied in the ( temperature , chirality ) plane . for high enough values of the chirality parameter @xmath96 , ^2 ( 1 - ^2 32 ( ^2 - ( t _ - t_0 ) ) )",
    "> 9 we get a continuous transition towards a biaxial helix at a reduced temperature @xmath97 corresponding to a real temperature t",
    "_ = t_0 + ^2 below the transition , the reduced density grows as @xmath98 . the low temperature phase can be viewed as a compact phase with helical order . from a protein - oriented point of view",
    ", this would correspond to a direct transition from a coil state ( denatured ) to a native state ( i.e. compact with secondary structures ) .    at much lower chirality , when @xmath99 ,",
    "the scenario is more like the one in section [ sec : virial ] : there is first a @xmath0 collapse transition at @xmath100 , followed at a lower temperature by a discontinuous transition towards a `` uniaxial '' helix .    at intermediate chiralities ,",
    "several phase diagrams are possible , depending on the relative values of the parameters .",
    "in particular , the location of the phase transition between the compact modulated phases ( biaxial and uniaxial ) is very model dependent .    in figure 1",
    ", we display a plausible phase diagram .",
    "using the fact that dipolar interactions imply the existence of a tensorial order parameter ( see equation ( [ paramor ] ) ) , we have shown that chiral chains may have isotropic ( @xmath0-like ) or anisotropic ( blue phase -like ) collapse transitions .",
    "this result was found in a simple model with helicoidal order .",
    "the connexion with blue phases is perhaps not very surprising since the molecules of some of these compounds have dipoles perpendicular to the molecular axis .",
    "it is clear that the same questions that arise in the study of blue phases should arise , mutatis mutandis , in the study of chiral dipolar chains :    * \\(i ) for very chiral systems , is the continuous transition towards the compact biaxial phase preempted by a discontinuous transition to a compact phase with a ( hexagonal , body - centered cubic , ... ) superposition of biaxial helices ? *",
    "\\(ii ) can one find a description of low chirality systems in terms of double twist cylinders ? *",
    "\\(iii ) can one link the order in @xmath73 , the chain configuration(s ) and the dipole configuration(s ) ? does a cristalline order in @xmath73 imply the existence of defects in the orientation of the chain ?",
    "the application of the previous results to ( bio)polymers can be roughly summarized as follows . since we are concerned with collapsed phases with uniform density , we are typically in a melt situation .",
    "the study of a single chain ( such as a protein ) is presently out of reach . in both cases",
    ", a more detailed analysis requires a better experimental knowledge of the various parameters ( chirality , ... ) .",
    "nevertheless , we think that our approach is useful for the protein folding problem .",
    "in particular @xcite , one may look for a double twist interpretation of @xmath1-helices and @xmath2-sheets , the possible existence of localized instabilities ( such as the ones in bp iii @xcite ) and their implications for the folding process . along these lines ,",
    "it is reassuring ( although not completely unexpected ) to note that the secondary structures of real proteins are well characterized by a @xmath101 tensorial order parameter @xcite .      :",
    "schematic phase diagram of the model in the ( temperature , chirality ) plane .",
    "the phases are labelled by @xmath102 ( coil ) , @xmath103 ( isotropic globule ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( anisotropic globules ) .",
    "the @xmath106 transition , and the @xmath107 transition ( for large enough chirality ) , are continuous .",
