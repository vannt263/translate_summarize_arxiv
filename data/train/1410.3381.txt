    "it fits in a larger program which aims at understanding the relationship between sft - invariants of a contact structure and global dynamical invariants of reeb flows . in this work",
    "we focus our attention on one dynamical invariant , the topological entropy .",
    "the topological entropy @xmath1 is a non - negative number that one associates to a dynamical system and which measures the complexity of the system .",
    "positivity of the topological entropy for a dynamical system implies that the system has some type of exponential instability .",
    "we first recall some basic definitions from contact geometry .",

    "the hyperplane @xmath6 is called the _",
    "contact structure_. for us a _ contact manifold _ will be a pair @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is the kernel of some contact form @xmath2 on @xmath4 ( these are usually called co - oriented contact manifolds in the literature ) .",
    "when @xmath2 satisfies @xmath9 , we will say that @xmath2 is a contact form on @xmath7 . on any contact manifold there",
    "always exist infinitely many different contact forms . given a contact form @xmath2 , its _ reeb vector field _ is the unique vector field @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the reeb flow @xmath13 of @xmath2 is the flow generated by the vector field @xmath10 .",
    "we will refer to the periodic orbits of @xmath13 as _ reeb orbits _",
    "of @xmath2 .",
    "the action @xmath14 of a reeb orbit is defined by @xmath15 .",
    "a contact form is called _ hypertight _ if its reeb flow has no contractible periodic orbits .",
    "an isotropic submanifold of @xmath7 is a submanifold of @xmath4 whose tangent bundle is contained in @xmath8 .",
    "when this submanifold is of maximal possible dimension , it is called a _ legendrian submanifold _ of @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that the maximal possible dimension of an isotropic submanifold is @xmath16 .",
    "given a contact form @xmath17 and a pair of legendrian submanifolds @xmath18 , a _",
    "reeb chord _ from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is a trajectory @xmath21 of the reeb flow of @xmath17 that starts in @xmath19 and ends in @xmath20 .",

    "a reeb chord @xmath21 is said to be _ transverse _ if the intersection @xmath24 is transverse at the endpoint of @xmath21 .",
    "we study the topological entropy of reeb flows from the point of view of contact topology .",
    "more precisely , we search for conditions on the topology of a contact manifold @xmath0 that force * all * reeb flows on @xmath0 to have positive topological entropy .",
    "the condition we impose is on the behaviour of a contact topological invariant called strip legendrian contact homology .",
    "we show that if a contact manifold @xmath0 admits a contact form @xmath25 and a pair of legendrian knots @xmath18 for which the strip legendrian contact homology is well defined and has _ exponential homotopical growth _ , then all reeb flows on @xmath0 have positive topological entropy .",
    "the inspiration for studying the topological entropy of reeb flows from this perspective comes from the study of geodesic flows .",
    "it is an important result in the theory of geodesic flows that if the based loop space of a manifold @xmath26 has a rich homology , then for every riemannian metric @xmath27 on @xmath26 the geodesic flow of @xmath27 on the unit tangent bundle @xmath28 of @xmath26 has positive topological entropy ; see paternain s book @xcite .",
    "geodesic flows on the unit tangent bundle are examples of reeb flows .",
    "the reason for this is that there exists a contact structure @xmath29 on @xmath30 such that for every riemannian metric @xmath27 on @xmath26 , the geodesic flow @xmath31 of @xmath27 coincides with the reeb flow of a contact form @xmath32 on @xmath33 . in @xcite macarini and schlenk showed that if the based loop space of@xmath26 has rich homology then every reeb flow on @xmath33 has positive topological entropy .",
    "their result can be seen as an extension of the result previously known for geodesic flows in @xmath30 to the larger class of reeb flows on @xmath34 .",
    "the strategy to estimate the topological entropy used in @xcite can be sketched as follows :    exponential growth of lagrangian floer homology of the cotangent fiber @xmath35 + @xmath36 + exponential volume growth of the unit tangent fiber @xmath37 for all reeb flows in @xmath38 + @xmath36 + positivity of the topological entropy for all reeb flows in @xmath38 .    to obtain the first implication macarini and schlenk use the fact that the contact manifold @xmath38 has the structure of a legendrian fibration , and apply the geometric idea of @xcite to show that the number of trajectories connecting a legendrian fiber to another legendrian fiber can be used to obtain a volume growth estimate .",
    "inspired by @xcite we present in this article techniques that can be used to estimate the topological entropy for reeb flows on contact 3-manifolds which are not unit cotangent bundles . because most contact @xmath39-manifolds are not legendrian fibrations , it is usually not possible to apply the scheme presented above .",
    "however a sufficiently small neighbourhood of a given legendrian knot in a contact @xmath39-manifold can always be given the structure of a legendrian fibration .",
    "this local structure of a legendrian fibration allows us to use a localised version of the geometric idea of @xcite , and to prove that the exponential growth of the strip legendrian contact homology of a pair of legendrian knots on a contact 3-manifold @xmath0,implies exponential growth of the length of these legendrian knots for any reeb flow on @xmath40 .",
    "applying yomdin s theorem ( see @xcite ) we obtain the following result , which is the main structural result of this paper .",
    "[ theorem1 ] let @xmath41 be a contact 3-manifold , and @xmath25 be a hypertight contact form on @xmath7 adapted to the pair of disjoint legendrian knots @xmath18 .",
    "assume that the strip legendrian contact homology @xmath42 has exponential homotopical growth rate with exponential weight @xmath43 .",
    "then , the reeb flow of any @xmath44 contact form @xmath2 on @xmath7 has positive topological entropy .",
    "moreover , if we denote by @xmath45 the positive function such that @xmath46 we have @xmath47    theorem [ theorem1 ] gives a criterion implying that all reeb flows on a contact 3-manifold have positive topological entropy .",
    "to explain the significance of this result we quote a result due to katok @xcite and lima and sarig @xcite which shows that positivity of topological entropy of the 3-dimensional flow of a vector field without singularities has deep implications for the dynamics of such flows .",
    "if @xmath48 is a smooth flow on a closed oriented 3-manifold generated by a non - vanishing vector field , then @xmath48 has positive topological entropy if , and only if , there exists a smale `` horseshoe '' as a subsystem of the flow . as a consequence",
    ", the number of hyperbolic periodic orbits of @xmath48 grows exponentially with respect to the period .    here",
    "a `` horseshoe '' is a compact invariant set where the dynamics is semi - conjugate to that of the suspension of a finite shift by a finite - to - one map . in particular , the number of hyperbolic periodic orbits on a `` horseshoe '' of a 3-dimensional flow @xmath48 grows exponentially with respect to the period .",
    "the recent work of lima and sarig @xcite proves a stronger result : there exists an invariant set @xmath49 of @xmath48 of full topological entropy where the dynamics of the restriction @xmath50 is semi - conjugate to the suspension of a countable shift by a finite - to - one map .",
    "it is worthy noting that their set @xmath51 is not necessarily a horseshoe , since it may not be compact .",
    "nevertheless , since the topological entropy on countable shifts is the supremum of the topological entropy of its finite subshifts , @xcite implies that @xmath48 has horseshoes with topological entropy as close to @xmath52 as we wish .",
    "it follows from the result of katok , and lima and sarig , that if a contact 3-manifold @xmath0 satisfies the hypothesis of theorem [ theorem1 ] , then for every reeb flow on @xmath0 the number of hyperbolic periodic orbits grows exponentially with the period .",
    "an interesting feature of this result ( and also of a result in @xcite ) is that it gives a method of proving the existence of many reeb orbits of a reeb flow which is not based on the use of a contact topological invariant defined using reeb orbits .",
    "the appearance of the reeb orbits is obtained as a consequence of a multiplicity result for the existence of * reeb chords*.    the other main result of the paper is the existence of a large family of contact 3-manifolds which satisfy the hypothesis of theorem [ theorem1 ] .",
    "[ theorem2 ] let @xmath53 be a closed oriented connected 3-manifold which can be cut along a nonempty family of incompressible tori into a family @xmath54 of irreducible manifolds with boundary such that the component @xmath55 satisfies :    * @xmath55 is the mapping torus of a diffeomorphism @xmath56 with pseudo - anosov monodromy on a surface @xmath57 with non - empty boundary .",
    "then @xmath53 can be given infinitely many different tight contact structures @xmath58 , such that :    * there exist disjoint legendrian knots @xmath19 , @xmath20 on @xmath59 , and a contact form @xmath60 on @xmath59 adapted to the pair @xmath19 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath61 has exponential homotopical growth rate .",
    "it follows that every reeb flow on @xmath59 has positive topological entropy .",
    "the contact manifolds covered by this theorem fall are among the examples of tight contact manifolds constructed in @xcite and coincide with the ones studied in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the theorem above that on these contact 3-manifolds every reeb flow has positive topological entropy , a result which was proved by the author using different methods in @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the methods developed in this paper and in @xcite are independent .",
    "we believe that they are complementary .",
    "one advantage of the methods of @xcite is that they give estimates for the topological entropy for @xmath62 reeb flows while the method we use here is only valid for @xmath44 reeb flows . on the other hand ,",
    "there are examples of high - dimensional contact manifolds which are simply connected and on which every reeb flow has positive topological entropy : the unit tangent bundles of simply connected manifolds presented in @xcite and the new examples constructed in @xcite are of this type . on simply connected manifolds there is no hope of applying the methods of @xcite but the volume growth technique for estimating topological entropy developed here can still be used as we show in @xcite . in general",
    ", we expect that detecting exponential volume growth of legendrian submanifolds should be the most robust method to estimate topological entropy of reeb flows in high dimensional contact manifolds .",
    "the techniques developed in this article are fundamental for several projects being developed by the author with collaborators .",
    "we list some of these projects .    * in a joint project with pedro a.s .",
    "salomo @xcite we combine ideas of this article with those of @xcite to study the forcing of topological entropy in contact 3-manifolds .",
    "more precisely , we establish a criterion to determine if a transverse knot @xmath49 on a contact 3-manifold @xmath0 forces topological entropy , in the sense that every reeb flow on @xmath0 which has @xmath49 as a reeb orbit has positive topological entropy .",
    "this criterion is then used to obtain a contact topological generalisation of a theorem of denvir and mackay @xcite that says that if a riemannian metric of the two - dimensional torus that has a simple closed contractible geodesic , then its geodesic flow has positive topological entropy . * in a joint project with leonardo macarini @xcite we use contact connected sums to obtain examples of contact manifolds of dimension @xmath63 on which every reeb flow has positive topological entropy , and which are not unit tangent bundles or quotients of unit tangent bundles . in order to prove this",
    "we show that a higher - dimensional version of theorem [ theorem1 ] is true provided that the legendrian submanifolds in question are spheres .",
    "* in a joint work with vincent colin and ko honda we combine the techniques developed in this paper with those of @xcite to use openbook decompositions to prove positivity of topological entropy for all reeb flows on many contact 3-manifolds .",
    "this work aims at establishing that on `` most '' tight contact 3-manifolds every reeb flow has positive topological entropy . * in our proof of theorem [ theorem1 ]",
    "we have showed that if , on a contact 3-manifold @xmath7 , there exists a contact form @xmath25 and a pair of disjoint legendrian knots @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfying the hypothesis of theorem [ theorem1 ] then for any contact form @xmath2 on @xmath7 the length of @xmath64 grows exponentially as @xmath65 .",
    "it is natural to ask if , under the same hypothesis , this growth property is shared by all legendrian knots @xmath66 belonging to the same legendrian isotopy class of @xmath19 . in a forthcoming paper @xcite we will show that this is in fact the case . in this same paper",
    "we will also show that , under the hypothesis of theorem [ theorem1 ] , for any contact form @xmath2 on @xmath0 the topological entropy of @xmath67 is positive when restricted to @xmath68-limit @xmath69 of a legendrian knot @xmath66 , if @xmath66 is a generic element in the legendrian isotopy class of @xmath19 is the unit tangent bundle of a surface of genus @xmath70 is given in @xcite . ] .",

    "@xmath69 of @xmath66 is a compact set invariant by the the flow @xmath71 defined as : + @xmath72 + the positivity of the topological entropy of @xmath71 restricted to @xmath69 can be interpreted in the following way : asymptotically , the path of curves @xmath73 detects the positive topological entropy of @xmath74 .",
    "we believe that this result helps to clarify the role that legendrian curves can have in the study of the global dynamics of reeb flows .      we will give an intuitive idea of the proof of theorem [ theorem1 ] .",
    "the basic idea , which is also used in @xcite , is to use the number of reeb chords of @xmath2 from a legendrian submanifold @xmath19 to other legendrian submanifolds to estimate the growth rate of the volume of @xmath75 .",
    "in @xcite the authors study reeb chords from one fixed unit tangent fiber @xmath76 in the unit tangent bundle @xmath77 to the unit tangent fibers @xmath78 , where @xmath79 belongs to a set of full measure in @xmath26 . using lagrangian floer homology",
    "they show that if the homology of the based loop space of @xmath26 is rich , then there exist numbers @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , and a set @xmath83 of full measure in @xmath26 , such that for @xmath84 we have : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of reeb chords of @xmath2 from @xmath76 to @xmath78 . using the canonical projection from @xmath77 to @xmath26 they estimate the area of the cylinder @xmath87\\}$ ] via the counting functions @xmath86 .",
    "the idea of using counting functions for such area estimates is due to gabriel paternain ; see @xcite .",
    "the result is an inequality of the form : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the measure induced by a riemannian metric @xmath27 on @xmath26 , and @xmath90 is volume of @xmath26 for the measure @xmath89 .",
    "we point out , that in this last inequality , the fact that @xmath30 is a legendrian fibration is used in a crucial way .",
    "most contact 3-manifolds do not have the structure of legendrian fibration .",
    "in fact the only contact 3-manifolds with such structures are unit tangent bundles of surfaces and their coverings .",
    "however , a sufficiently small neighbourhood of a legendrian knot @xmath20 on a contact 3-manifold @xmath7 , is always a legendrian fibration .",
    "this is a consequence of the weinstein legendrian neighbourhood theorem , whose 3-dimensional version asserts that sufficiently small neighbourhoods of legendrian knots are always contactomorphic ; i.e there exists a normal form for small neighbourhoods of legendrian knots .    in the hypotheses of theorem [ theorem1 ] we have a pair of disjoint legendrian knots @xmath91 in @xmath7 and a contact form @xmath25 , for which the strip legendrian contact homology @xmath92 has exponential homotopical growth rate .",
    "we begin by choosing a small neighbourhood @xmath93 of @xmath20 which is contactomorphic to @xmath94 ; where @xmath95 and @xmath20 is identified with @xmath96 .",

    "we can use the counting functions @xmath107 to estimate the area of the intersection @xmath108 between the cylinder @xmath109 and the neighbourhood @xmath93 ( see figure [ figure ] ) .",
