    "in order to obtain a quantum mechanical model for a particular physical system such as a particle moving in space , it is necessary to supplement the abstract quantum formalism with formal rules which explicitly determine the form of the operators that represent particular measurements performed on the system , or that represent particular symmetry transformations  ( such as displacement or rotation ) of the frame of reference in which the system is being observed .",
    "these formal rules usually suppose that measurements are described in the framework of classical physics , so that one speaks of `` a measurement of observable  ( or property )  @xmath0 '' and of an operator that represents such a measurement .",
    "these formal rules can be usefully classified as follows :    * _ operator rules . _",
    "rules for writing down operators representing measurements of observables that are known functions of other , elementary , observables whose operators are given   is represented by operator  @xmath1 , then a measurement of  @xmath2 is represented by  @xmath3 ; ( ii )  rule  2  ( sum rule ) :  if measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 are represented by operators  @xmath5 , respectively , then a measurement of  @xmath6 is represented by  @xmath7  ( and similarly for more than two observables ) , and ( iii )  rule  3  ( product rule ) :  if measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 are represented by commuting operators  @xmath5 , respectively , then a measurement of  @xmath8 is represented by  @xmath9  ( and similarly for more than two observables ) .",
    "a more general rule that is often employed is :  ( iv )  rule  3@xmath10  ( hermitization rule ) :  if measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 are represented by operators  @xmath5 , respectively , then a measurement of  @xmath8 is represented by  @xmath11 .",
    "the above rules are generally assumed to apply to arbitrary hermitian operators . ] .",
    "for example , such rules are needed to be able to write down the operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath12 , given the classical relation  @xmath13 , in terms of the operators  @xmath14 and  @xmath15 which represent measurements of  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 , respectively . * _ commutation relations .",
    "_ commutation relations between operators that represent measurements of fundamental observables such as position , momentum , and components of angular momentum .",
    "the commutation relations  @xmath18=i\\hbar$ ] and  @xmath19=i\\hbar{\\textsf{l}}_z$ ] , are the obvious examples , while dirac s poisson bracket rule ,  @xmath20 = i\\hbar \\widehat{\\{a , b\\}}$ ] , is the more general rule for evaluating commutation relations , where  @xmath21 is the classical poisson bracket for observables  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 of a physical system , and  @xmath22 , @xmath1 , and  @xmath23 are the respective operators . * _ transformation operators .",
    "_ explicit forms of the operators that represent symmetry transformations of a frame of reference , such as the @xmath16-displacement operator  @xmath24 . * _ measurement  transformation relations . _ the relations between measurement operators and transformation operators .",
    "for example , the @xmath16-displacement operator ,  @xmath25 , stands in the relation  @xmath26 to the @xmath16-momentum measurement operator ,  @xmath15 .",
    "the physical origin of many of the above - mentioned rules is obscure .",
    "for example , although one can give simple physical arguments   for the operator rule which states that , if a measurement of  @xmath0 is represented by operator  @xmath1 , then a measurement of a function ,  @xmath2 , of  @xmath0 is represented by operator  @xmath3 , the generalization of such arguments to measurements of functions of two or more observables encounters severe difficulties due to the possible non - commutativity of the operators that represent these observables . as a result of such difficulties , operator rules tend to be heuristic and tend to lead to inconsistencies when applied to particular examples  . ] .",
    "similarly , the commutation relationship  @xmath18=i\\hbar$ ] is typically obtained from schroedinger s equation or from dirac s poisson bracket rule , both of whose derivations involve abstract assumptions whose physical origin is obscure",
    ".    recent work on the elucidation of the physical origin of the quantum formalism either focuses exclusively on the derivation of the abstract quantum formalism  @xcite or is concerned with the derivation of the schroedinger equation directly from informational ideas without taking the abstract quantum formalism as a given  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the question of what additional physical ideas are needed to obtain the formal rules described above _ given _ the abstract quantum formalism has received relatively little recent attention .",
    "operator rules have been discussed in a few publications , for example in  @xcite , but a derivation of the operator rules on the basis of a physical principle , taking the abstract formalism as a given , has not been successfully completed . the most recent systematic attempt to derive the commonly employed commutation relations and measurement  transformation relations in such a manner",
    "is found in  @xcite  ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "the commutation relationships for the operators that represent the galilean group of transformations are first derived by exploiting the group structure of the classically - described transformations .",
    "then , by establishing the relation between these transformation operators and particular measurement operators , commutation relations for these measurement operators are obtained .",
    "however , this approach implicitly makes use of operator rules , and relies upon auxiliary assumptions , such as the assumption that certain measurement operators are unchanged by the action of particular symmetry operators , whose physical origin is unclear .    in this paper , we show that , starting from the abstract quantum formalism , it is possible to derive the above - mentioned formal rules in a straightforward manner from a correspondence principle . roughly speaking , this principle , the _ average - value correspondence principle _  ( avcp ) , asserts that , in a classical experiment , if a relation holds between the outcomes of a set of measurements performed on a physical system , then the same relation holds _ on average _ in a corresponding , suitably - defined quantum experiment on the same physical system , the average being taken over infinitely many trials of the quantum experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : avcp ] by formulating the  avcp . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deduction ] , the avcp is used to obtain several generalized operator rules which connect the average values of operators at different times , from which the commonly used operator rules of quantum theory follow as a special case . using the avcp and postulate  3.4  ( from paper  i )",
    ", we then derive the explicit form of the temporal evolution operator , which completes the derivation of the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism begun in paper  i.    next , in sec .  [",
    "sec : commutation - relations ] , taking the infinite - dimensional form of the abstract quantum formalism as a given , we use the avcp to derive many of the commonly employed formal rules of quantum theory , namely  ( a ) the commutation relations  @xmath18=i\\hbar$ ] and  @xmath19=i\\hbar{\\textsf{l}}_z$ ] , and dirac s poisson bracket rule , ( b )  the explicit form of the operators for displacements and rotations , and ( c )  the relation between momentum and displacement operators , and between angular momentum and rotation operators .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : arbitrariness ] , we show that , in the functions  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 derived in paper  i , the signs can be taken to be positive and the constants  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 can be taken to have the values  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 without loss of generality .",
    "we note that the treatment of the formal rules is illustrative rather than exhaustive , so that only the most commonly encountered measurement and transformation operators which are needed to formulate non - relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics have been discussed .",
    "many other formal rules  ( such as the operators for galilei transformations , temporal displacement , and discrete transformations such as spatial inversion ) can be obtained by arguments which closely follow those presented .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the results obtained .",
    "suppose that , as described in paper  i , a quantum model  @xmath33 , of dimension  @xmath34 , has been constructed to describe an abstract experimental set - up consisting of a source of identical systems , a measurement set  @xmath35 , and an interaction set  @xmath36 .",
    "the measurements in  @xmath35 , and the degenerate forms of measurements in  @xmath35   is defined operationally in paper  i. such a measurement has  @xmath37 possible outcomes , and can be represented as an @xmath34-dimensional degenerate hermitian operator  ( with  @xmath38 distinct eigenvalues ) . ] , are represented by @xmath34-dimensional hermitian operators  ( possibly with degenerate eigenvalues ) , and shall be called _ quantum _ measurements .",
    "suppose that quantum measurement  @xmath39 , with operator  @xmath1 , represents a measurement that is classically described as a measurement of some observable  @xmath0  ( which we shall henceforth abbreviate to  `` quantum measurement  @xmath39  ( or operator  @xmath1 ) represents a measurement of  @xmath0 '' ) .",
    "suppose that we wish to determine whether there is a quantum measurement that represents a measurement of , say ,  @xmath40 and , if so , to determine the operator which can be said to represent this measurement .",
    "one can imagine that , classically , a measurement of  @xmath40 is implemented by a process where a measurement of  @xmath0 is performed and the outcome is then squared .",
    "if this implementation is described in the quantum model , it follows that , if the input state is an element ,  @xmath41 , of an orthonormal set of eigenvectors of  @xmath1 , the output state of the process is  @xmath41 and the observed result of the process is  @xmath42 , where  @xmath43  ( @xmath44 ) . according to this line of reasoning",
    ", it follows at once that the operator  @xmath45 therefore represents a measurement of  @xmath40",
    ".    however , this simple argument does not readily generalize .",
    "for example , suppose that quantum measurements  @xmath39 and  @xmath46 , with operators  @xmath1 and  @xmath23 , represent measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "suppose that we wish to determine the operator  ( if any exists ) that represents a measurement of  @xmath47 .",
    "classically , one imagines that such a measurement is implemented by making measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 simultaneously on a system , and adding the outcomes .",
    "however , if  @xmath20 \\ne 0 $ ] , this implementation can not be described without modification in the quantum framework since the measurements can not be performed at the same time , and the order in which they are performed is of potential significance .",
    "now , the conventional operator rules of quantum theory assert that a measurement of  @xmath47 is represented by the operator  @xmath48 .",
    "although this seems entirely reasonable on a formal , symbolic level , it is not clear in what physical sense  @xmath48 can be said to ` represent ' the measurement since , whereas the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of  @xmath1 directly reflect the output states and outcome values obtained when measurement  @xmath39 is performed on the system , the eigenvectors of  @xmath48 do not , in general , coincide with the eigenvectors of either  @xmath1 or  @xmath23 , and the eigenvalues of  @xmath48 do not , in general , coincide with the possible results of any plausible implementation  ( described in the quantum model ) of a measurement of  @xmath47 that involves performing measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 and combining their outcomes .",
    "for example , a measurement represented by operator  @xmath49 on a spin-1/2 particle has possible outcomes  @xmath50 , whereas the possible results of an implementation where a measurement of  @xmath51 is followed by a measurement of  @xmath52  ( or vice - versa ) , and their outcomes are added , are  @xmath53 .",
    "the above observations illustrate the difficulty of obtaining a physical understanding of the operator rules of quantum theory even in simple cases of interest .",
    "below , we shall formulate a physical principle which gives a clear physical meaning to the sense in which an operator can be said to represent a classically - described measurement , and , in the majority of cases of interest , uniquely determines the operator which represents such a measurement .",
    "consider again a measurement that , from the classical standpoint , is said to be a measurement of  @xmath40 , where  @xmath0 is some observable .",
    "classically , one can imagine a measurement of  @xmath40 being implemented in one of three different ways  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mments - of - a - squared ] ) : ( i )  make a measurement of  @xmath0 on one copy of the system , and square the outcome ; ( ii )  make two immediately successive measurements of  @xmath0 on one copy of the system , and multiply the two outcomes ; or  ( iii )  make two simultaneous measurements of  @xmath0 on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and multiply the two outcomes .",
    "although the first of these implementations is the one we have considered above , all three implementations yield the same result when modeled classically , and so can be regarded as equally valid implementations of a measurement of  @xmath40 .",
    "three implementations of the measurement classically described as `` a measurement of  @xmath40 '' . in  ( i ) , a measurement of  @xmath0 is made on one copy of the system , and the outcome is squared to give the result ; in ( ii ) , two immediately successive measurements of  @xmath0 are made on one copy of the system , and the result is obtained by multiplying the two outcomes ; and ( iii )  two simultaneous measurements of  @xmath0 are made on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and the result is obtained by multiplying the two outcomes . in a classical model of this situation , each implementation yields the same result .",
    "however , in the quantum model of these implementations , the expected result of  ( i ) and  ( ii ) is  @xmath54 whereas the expected result of  ( iii ) is  @xmath55.,width=312 ]    now , perhaps surprisingly , when described using the quantum model , these implementations do not , in general , yield the same expected results . consider a quantum experimental arrangement employing the first implementation . in each run of the experiment ,",
    "one copy of the system is prepared in some given state .",
    "let the probability that a measurement of  @xmath0 yields outcome  @xmath56  ( @xmath57 ) , with value  @xmath58 , be denoted  @xmath59 .",
    "then , the expected result is given by @xmath60 one finds that implementation  ( ii ) yields the same expected result .",
    "however , in implementation  ( iii ) , where , in each run of the experiment , two copies of the system are prepared in the same state , one obtains @xmath61 with  @xmath59 and  @xmath62 denoting respectively the probabilities that the measurements of  @xmath0 on the first and second copy yield outcomes  @xmath56 and  @xmath63  ( @xmath64 ) .    in this example , the differences between the implementations as viewed in the quantum model arise due to the fact that , in the quantum framework , an immediate repetition of a measurement on the same copy of a system is different from performing a second simultaneous measurement on a separate , identically - prepared , copy of the system .    in the case of a measurement that is classically described as a measurement of  @xmath47 , where measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 are assumed to occur at the same time ,",
    "one needs to take into account the additional fact that , in the quantum framework , the order in which two measurements is performed is of possible importance .",
    "accordingly , one can imagine implementing a measurement of  @xmath47 in one of at least three different ways  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mments - of - a - plus - b ] ) : ( i )  make a measurement of  @xmath0 , and then a measurement of  @xmath4 , on one copy of the system , and add the outcomes ; ( ii ) make a measurement of  @xmath4 , and then a measurement of  @xmath0 , on one copy of the system , and add the outcomes ; ( iii )  make a measurement of  @xmath0 on one copy of the system and , simultaneously , a measurement of  @xmath4 on a second copy of the system prepared in the same state as the first copy , and add the outcomes . once again , in a classical model of this situation , the results agree .",
    "however , if one calculates the expected results in the quantum model , one finds that , if  @xmath20\\ne 0 $ ] , all three will , in general , disagree with one another .",
    "three implementations of the measurement classically described as `` a measurement of  @xmath47 '' . in  ( i ) , a measurement of  @xmath0 , and then a measurement of  @xmath4 , is made on one copy of the system , and the outcomes are then added to give the result ; in ( ii ) , a measurement of  @xmath4 , and then a measurement of  @xmath0 , is made on one copy of the system , and the outcomes are then added to give the result ; and ( iii )  simultaneous measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 are made on two separate copies of the system prepared in the same state , and the result is obtained by adding the two outcomes . in a classical model of this situation , each implementation yields the same result .",
    "however , in the quantum model of this situation , the three implementations do not , in general , yield the same expected results.,width=312 ]    as these examples illustrate , different implementations of the same classically - described measurement do not , in general , give the same expected result in the quantum model of the experimental arrangement .",
    "thus , whereas a classical description of a measurement , such as `` a measurement of  @xmath65 '' , adequately describes the intended measurement insofar as the outcome is concerned in the classical framework , such a description allows for more than one implementation which , in general , do not yield the same expected result when modeled in the quantum framework .",
    "the existence of different implementations of the same classically - described measurement immediately raises two questions .",
    "first , are these implementations , in some sense , equally valid in the quantum framework , or it is possible to find some reasonable physical basis upon which to select particular implementations and regard these as more fundamental than the others ?",
    "second , is it possible to find operators that represent the selected implementations , and , if so , do all the selected implementations of a given measurement have the same operator representation ?    to answer these questions , we begin by observing that , although the above implementations are all regarded as _",
    "bone fide _ measurements in the classical model , a measurement is only describable as such in the quantum model , and so can be called a quantum measurement , if it can be represented by a hermitian operator which represents a single measurement performed upon one copy of the system at a particular time .",
    "so , for example , although implementation  ( iii ) of a measurement of  @xmath40 can be modeled in the quantum framework , the process _ as a whole _ can not be described as a quantum measurement since it involves two separate measurements .",
    "in contrast , implementation  ( i ) of a measurement of  @xmath40 can be described as a quantum measurement since it only involves a single measurement on one copy of the system .    however , although an implementation modeled in the quantum framework that involves more than one measurement can not itself be regarded as a quantum measurement , we can reasonably ask whether it is possible to find a quantum measurement ,  @xmath66 , with operator  @xmath67 , which , in some sense to be determined , can nonetheless be said to _ represent _ the implementation .    at the outset",
    ", we note that it makes no sense to require that measurement  @xmath66 yield the same outcome as a given implementation since measurement outcomes are only probabilistically determined in the quantum framework .",
    "however , we _ can _ impose the simple condition that , over an infinite number of runs , the average value of measurement  @xmath66 should coincide with the average result obtained from the implementation for any initial state of the system .",
    "for example , in the case of an implementation of a measurement of  @xmath40 , measurement  @xmath68 which , by hypothesis , represents the implementation , must be such that , for all states of the system ,  @xmath69 is equal to the expected result obtained from the implementation . in the case of implementations  ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) described above , using eq .  , we accordingly obtain the condition that the relation @xmath70 must hold for all states ,  @xmath71 , of the system . from this condition , we can conclude that @xmath72 in the case of implementation  ( iii ) , using eq .",
    ", we obtain the condition that the relation @xmath73 must hold for all  @xmath71 . by diagonalizing  @xmath1",
    ", one can readily show that this condition implies that  @xmath1 is a multiple of the identity , which represents a trivial measurement that yields the same outcome irrespective of the state of the system .",
    "therefore , implementation  ( iii ) does not satisfy the above average - value condition in the case of any non - trivial measurement of  @xmath0 , and can therefore be reasonably eliminated .",
    "hence , in this case , the average - value condition is sufficiently strong so as to be able to pick out implementations  ( i ) and  ( ii ) , and , since the average - value condition also implies that these implementations are both represented by the operator ,  @xmath45 , one can unambiguously conclude that a measurement of  @xmath40 is represented by the operator  @xmath45 .    proceeding in a similar way , restricting ourselves for the time being to measurements  @xmath39 and  @xmath46 that are not sub - system measurements",
    ", one finds that , in the case of a measurement of  @xmath74 , only implementation  ( iii ) is possible if  @xmath20\\ne 0 $ ] , which then yields the operator @xmath75 if  @xmath20= 0 $ ] , then all three implementations are possible , and all yield the same operator ,  @xmath67 , as above .    finally , in the case of a measurement of  @xmath76 , with  @xmath77=0 $ ] , one finds that the implementation must the one where measurements  @xmath78 and  @xmath79 are performed on the same copy of the system , in which case the operator  @xmath80 is obtained .",
    "hence , we see that the average - value condition is sufficient to yield a unique operator representation for the measurements considered above . based on the above considerations , we can tentatively formulate the following general rule :  in the case of a measurement which has an implementation that contains two elementary measurements  ( not sub - system measurements ) represented by commuting operators , it is possible to find a quantum measurement that represents the implementation if the two elementary measurements are performed on the same copy of the system ; but , when the operators do not commute , the elementary measurements must be performed on different copies of the system .",
    "we now consider implementations of a measurement of  @xmath76 in the case when  @xmath20\\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "the general rule just given suggests that we should consider the implementation of this measurement where the measurements of  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 are performed on different copies of the system .",
    "this implementation has the expected value @xmath81 with  @xmath59 and  @xmath62 denoting respectively the probabilities that the measurement of  @xmath0 on the first copy and the measurement of  @xmath4 on the second copy yield outcomes  @xmath56 and  @xmath63  ( @xmath82 ) , and  @xmath83 respectively denoting the values of the @xmath56th and @xmath63th outcomes of measurements  @xmath39 and  @xmath46 . imposing the above average - value condition ,",
    "the operator  @xmath67 that represents this implementation must satisfy the condition @xmath84 for all  @xmath71 .",
    "however , for non - commuting  @xmath1 and  @xmath23 , one finds that  @xmath67 can not be found such that this relation is satisfied for all  @xmath71 .",
    "we note , however , that with @xmath85 equation   holds for the eigenstates of  @xmath1 and the eigenstates of  @xmath23 , which suggests that we may be able to weaken the average - value condition in this case so that we only require that eq",
    ".   holds for these eigenstates .",
    "however , as we shall illustrate later  ( sec .",
    "[ sec : inconsistencies ] ) , the application of eq .   can lead to inconsistencies .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , from the point of view of the average - value condition , it is not possible to find an operator that represents a measurement of  @xmath76 when the operators  @xmath1 and  @xmath23 do not commute . more generally , we find that , when  @xmath20\\ne 0 $ ] , it is necessary to exclude measurements of  @xmath86 , with  @xmath87 analytic  ( so that  @xmath87 has a well - defined polynomial expansion in  @xmath0 and  @xmath4 ) , where the polynomial expansion of  @xmath87 contains product terms .    finally , in the case of a measurement which has a classical implementation which contains two elementary measurements that are performed on different sub - systems of a composite system , one finds that the implementation can be represented by a quantum measurement irrespective of whether the two measurements are performed on the same or on different copies of the system , and that the different possible implementations are represented by the same operator .      in the examples",
    "above , we have considered implementations of a classically - described measurement in which the measurement and the elementary measurements in the implementation are performed at the same time , and in the same frame of reference . however , as the following examples illustrate , these are unnecessary restrictions .",
    "first , classically , for a non - relativistic particle of mass  @xmath88 , one can implement a measurement of  @xmath16 performed at time  @xmath89 by a process where measurements of  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 are performed at time  @xmath90 , and the function  @xmath91 is then computed .",
    "second , one can implement a measurement of  @xmath92 on a particle in the reference frame  @xmath93 that is displaced along the @xmath16-axis relative to frame  @xmath94 by performing a measurement of  @xmath16 in frame  @xmath94 , and computing the appropriate function  @xmath95 that relates  @xmath16 and  @xmath92 .",
    "the above considerations regarding the implementation of a classically - described measurement are applicable without change to the case where the measurement and the elementary measurements in its implementation are performed at different times or in different frames of reference .",
    "below , we shall accordingly generalize our notion of the implementation of a classically - described measurement .",
    "we shall now state a general principle which incorporates the observations made above concerning the average - value condition .",
    "an illustrative example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : avcp - example ] .",

    "will be negligible .    the question of whether eq .",
    "holds in the more general case where the function  @xmath4 can not be treated as the classical hamiltonian of the system is not discussed here .",

    "let us first consider the case where positive signs are chosen for both  @xmath87 and  @xmath439 . with constants  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 left in place , the derivation given in paper  i is altered as follows .",

    "fourth , by inspection of the argument used above to find the temporal evolution operator , one finds that  @xmath453 .",
    "in addition , the foregoing arguments lead to  @xmath454 .",
    "if one writes down the schroedinger equation implied by these relations , one obtains  @xmath455 , which implies that  @xmath456 as before .    in summary ,",
    "irrespective of the values of  @xmath123 , one obtains the same abstract quantum formalism .",
    "furthermore , although the constants  @xmath123 appears as a connection between  @xmath446 and  @xmath457 , we shall now show that they are unimportant insofar as observable predictions of the formalism , namely the prediction of the values and probabilities of the observable outcomes of measurements , are concerned .",
    "to do so , we shall consider an experiment where a system is prepared using measurement  @xmath39 and , after undergoing a physical transformation  ( either active or passive ) , is subject to measurement  @xmath458 .",
    "we shall first establish that the explicit form of a measurement operator that represents any given measurement is independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "first , consider the example of the operators  @xmath14 and  @xmath15 . the explicit form of these operators is determined by ( a )  the commutation relation  @xmath421=i\\hbar$ ] , ( b )  the measurement  transformation relation  @xmath459 , and ( c )  the relation  @xmath460 . in this case",
    ", one finds by inspection of the above derivation that these relations are all independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "more generally , the explicit form of measurement operators is determined by ( a )  commutation relationships between measurement operators , ( b )  the relation between measurement operators and transformation operators , and ( c )  the explicit form of transformation operators .",
    "first , since the dirac poisson bracket rule derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : pb - analogy ] is independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 , the commutation relations between measurement operators are independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "second , the measurement  transformation relations and the explicit form of the transformation relations are directly obtained via the avcp from the classical relation between the outcomes of measurements performed in the original and transformed frames of reference , and are therefore independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30  ( as illustrated by the above arguments leading to  @xmath459 and @xmath461 ) .",
    "therefore , in general , measurement operators are independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "next , we consider the operators that represent physical transformations .",
    "first consider active transformations .",
    "the general temporal evolution operator ,  @xmath462 is not explicitly dependent upon  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "the operator  @xmath207 is a function of the measurement operators  ( such as  @xmath302 for a particle moving along the @xmath16-axis ) relevant to the system , and is directly obtained  ( via the avcp ) from the classical relation between the classical hamiltonian ,  @xmath12 , and the classical observables that determine the state of the system , and is therefore also independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "since the measurement operators are themselves independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 , it follows that the operator representing any given temporal evolution is independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "second , the explicit form of operators representing passive transformations  ( such as displacement or rotation of a reference frame ) can be obtained by directly transposing the relevant classical relations  ( which connect the co - ordinates in the original and transformed frames ) into the quantum framework via the  avcp  ( as illustrated by the derivation of the co - ordinate representation of  @xmath25 above ) , and can be readily seen to therefore also be independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 . hence , a unitary or antiunitary operator that represents any given physical transformation is independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "now consider the above - mentioned experiment where measurement  @xmath39 is performed and , say , outcome  @xmath463 is obtained .",
    "with respect to measurement  @xmath39 , the resulting state is  @xmath464 up to an irrelevant overall phase .",
    "suppose the system now undergoes a physical transformation  ( either active or passive ) , and a second measurement ,  @xmath39 , is performed .",
    "since the physical transformation is represented by a unitary or antiunitary operator that is independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 as noted above , the outcome probabilities of the second measurement are unaffected by the value of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "this example includes the general case where the second measurement is measurement  @xmath458 since the latter can , by postulate  1.2  ( see paper  i ) , be represented by an arrangement consisting of measurement  @xmath39 immediately preceded and followed by suitable temporal evolution of the system .",
    "therefore , in the most general experiment we are considering , the outcome probabilities of the observable outcomes are also independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "finally , we note that , since the explicit form of the measurement operators is independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 , their eigenvalues are also independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , in summary , we find that both the probabilities and the values of the observable outcomes of measurements in the above general experiment are independent of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30",
    ". therefore , the values of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 can , without loss of generality , conveniently be chosen to be  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 .    if one chooses the signs of  @xmath87 and  @xmath439 not to be both positive , then this is equivalent to choosing positive signs for  @xmath87 and  @xmath439 but changing the values of  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 to some other values ,  @xmath465 and  @xmath466 , respectively . specifically , if one chooses the signs  @xmath467 , then  @xmath468 and  @xmath469 ; if  @xmath470 , then  @xmath468 and  @xmath471 ; and , if  @xmath472 , then  @xmath473 and  @xmath474",
    "but we have already shown that the choice of the constants  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 is unimportant , and hence the change in their values is unimportant .",
    "therefore , the signs can , without loss of generality , both be chosen to be positive .",
    "the derivation presented in this paper has shown that , using a clearly - motivated physical principle , it is possible to derive the explicit form of the temporal evolution operator given the postulates of paper  i , and to derive the formal rules of quantum theory in a systematic manner from appropriately chosen relations known to hold in classical physics .",
    "the derivation provides several physical insights into the formal rules .",
    "the first insight is that the classical description of a measurement  ( such as ` a measurement of  @xmath65 ' ) leaves open the possibility of more than one implementation , and that , when modeled in the quantum framework , these implementations are , in general , not equivalent .",
    "second , it is possible to impose a simple average - value condition that must be satisfied by an operator that can be said to represent a classical implementation of a measurement .",
    "this condition implies that many implementations can not be represented by an operator , and can therefore be eliminated from consideration .",
    "that is , one finds that there are implementations which , although acceptable in the classical framework , can not be represented by operators in the quantum framework without violating a very mild average - value condition .",
    "third , in the case of an implementation that satisfies the average - value condition , the operator that represents the implementation is uniquely determined by the average - value condition provided that the function ,  @xmath87 , that describes the implementation , is simple .",
    "one also finds that those implementations that satisfy the average - value condition are are represented by the same operator , so that it is possible to represent a measurement of  @xmath87 by a unique operator .",
    "if  @xmath87 is not simple , then it does not appear to be possible to apply the average - value condition , even in a weakened form , without inconsistencies arising .",
    "fourth , we have found that the avcp is incompatible with the assumption that every classically - described measurement on a system is represented by a quantum measurement in the quantum model of the system .",
    "for example , the avcp implies that a measurement of  @xmath76 does not have an operator representation if  @xmath77\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the fifth insight rests on the fact that , rather surprisingly , the avcp enables formal rules of each of the four types described in the introduction  ( operator rules , commutation relations , transformation operators , and measurement  transformation relations ) to be obtained in a uniform manner .",
    "consequently , one can see that the difference between these types of rules depends simply upon whether the classical relations that one is taking over into the quantum framework are relations between measurements performed at the same time  ( leading to the operator rules ) , at different times  ( leading to commutation relations for measurement operators ) , or in different frames of reference  ( leading to measurement  transformation relations and to the explicit forms of transformation operators ) . in short , from the perspective provided by the derivation , the commutation relation  @xmath230 = i\\hbar$ ] is no more elusive in its origin than the operator relation  @xmath475 .",
    "sixth , the derivation provides a clearer physical foundation to many particular formal rules that are commonly used in quantum theory .",
    "for example , the commutation relation  @xmath19=i\\hbar { \\textsf{l}}_z$ ] is ordinarily derived in the infinite - dimensional quantum formalism for a particle  ( by transposing the classical relation  @xmath476 , and cyclic permutations thereof , into the quantum framework using the operator rules ) , and is then assumed , without further justification , to also hold in the finite - dimensional case . here , we have obtained this commutation relation directly for finite- and infinite - dimensional quantum systems , and have done so in a manner that makes clear its connection with the properties of rotations .",
    "similarly , a restricted form of dirac s poisson bracket rule has been derived in a systematic manner using the avcp without making use of abstract analogies .",
    "finally , we remark that the general notion of average - value correspondence is already familiar in elementary quantum mechanics through ehrenfest s theorem  @xcite , which shows that the motion of a particle modeled in the quantum framework is , on average , approximated by the behavior of the particle when described classically .",
    "however , the possibility that such a correspondence might serve as the basis for a constructive principle that allows the formal rules of quantum theory to be determined by appropriately - chosen classical relations does not appear to have been widely explored  . it has been shown here that it is possible to formulate the notion of average - value correspondence in the form of an exact physical principle which , roughly speaking , allows the logic of ehrenfest s argument to be reversed , enabling the often physically obscure formal rules of quantum theory to be derived in a systematic manner from familiar relations known to hold in classical physics ."
