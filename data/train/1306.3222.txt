    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generates turbulence , but the efficiency of the mri depends ( often times , quite strongly ) on the ionization fraction of the gas . apart from regions very close to the star , protoplanetary disks are too cold to be thermally ionized and the coupling to magnetic fields is instead dependent on external sources of ionization . across large regions of the disk",
    "the predicted ionization level is very low , motivating disk models @xcite in which mri - driven turbulence is substantially suppressed or quenched entirely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mri can also be suppressed in regions of high ionization , either due to poor coupling between the field and fluid at low densities and high magnetic field strengths @xcite or when the mri stability condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "three non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects are important in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks : ohmic resistivity , the hall effect , and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "ohmic resistivity dominates in dense regions such as the mid - plane of the inner disk , while ambipolar diffusion dominates in tenuous gas near the disk surface and in the outer disk ( for a review , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ambipolar diffusion dominated outer disk is the focus of the current study . in the ambipolar regime ,",
    "ions and electrons are tied to magnetic fields and are collisionally coupled to the predominantly neutral gas .",
    "if the collisions are infrequent enough , this effect acts to damp out mri turbulence . in almost all models ,",
    "the outer disk has most of the mass and the longest viscous time scale , and hence understanding the dynamics of this region is critical for studies of disk evolution .    in a previous paper , @xcite ( paper i )",
    ", we studied how ambipolar diffusion affected mri turbulence in vertically stratified disk models , _ assuming _ that there was no net flux of vertical magnetic field threading the disk gas .",
    "we first carried out a series of local , shearing box simulations with a temporally and spatially constant collision to dynamical frequency ratio ( referred to here as the ambipolar elsasser number ) . in agreement with unstratified simulations",
    "@xcite , we found that as the elsasser number decreases ( i.e. , ambipolar diffusion becomes stronger ) , mri turbulence weakens , but not with the same monotonic behavior as was observed in the vertically _ unstratified _ simulations of @xcite .",
    "we then simulated the mri in realistic disk models , with a vertical profile of ambipolar diffusion based upon the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) ionization model of @xcite .",
    "this ionization model assumes that fuv photons penetrate a thin surface layer of the disk ( down to a column of @xmath70.010.1 g @xmath8 ) , and completely ionize trace species such as carbon and sulfur . below the fuv ionization layer ,",
    "chemical disk model calculations @xcite suggest an ambipolar elsassar number that is of the order of unity ( or lower ) , which damps the mri . with this profile ,",
    "our zero net flux simulations developed a layered structure analogous to the ohmic dead zone model of @xcite .",
    "we found vigorous surface accretion within the fuv ionization layer , overlying an  ambipolar damping zone \" near the mid - plane , where the mri was inactive .",
    "observations of protoplanetary disk lifetimes and t  tauri accretion rates @xcite are broadly consistent with a @xcite @xmath9 , which happens to be close to the value derived from _",
    "ideal _ mhd simulations of the mri in the zero net vertical flux limit @xcite .",
    "this implies that any significant suppression of the mri , due to non - ideal effects in the outer disk , is liable to conflict with observations , and indeed we found that the ambipolar damping zone seen in our zero net flux simulations failed to yield accretion rates as large as those typically observed ( by an order of magnitude or more ) .",
    "we thus suggested that a net flux might be a prerequisite for generating higher accretion rates .    in this companion paper , we study the effect of a non - zero net vertical field on mri - driven turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "will the presence of a net vertical magnetic flux enhance turbulence levels enough to agree with observational constraints ?",
    "will this same net flux contribute to any vertical angular momentum transport through a magnetic wind , such as that seen in recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we explore several field strengths of the net field and quantify both the disk structure and turbulence levels ( from which we ultimately estimate accretion rates ) in order to answer these questions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ method ] ,",
    "we describe our equations and numerical algorithm , the ionizational model that we employ , and the initial conditions for our simulations . we also carry out a convergence study of vertically stratified , net vertical field mri simulations in order to justify the resolution that we employ in the rest of the paper .",

    "we have carried out a series of simulations in the local , shearing box approximation @xcite , with an isothermal equation of state , and with outflow vertical boundary conditions that have been modified to enhance the buoyant removal of magnetic flux from the domain .",
    "these shearing box simulations are located at large radial distances from the central star and contain a highly simplified ionization model in which a thin layer above and below the disk mid - plane is assumed to be very strongly ionized due to stellar fuv photons @xcite ; below these highly ionized layers , we assume a constant , yet large value for the strength of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we now describe our calculations in more detail .      as in paper",
    "i , we use _ athena _ , a second - order accurate godunov flux - conservative code for solving the equations of mhd . _",
    "athena _ uses the dimensionally unsplit corner transport upwind ( ctu ) method of @xcite coupled with the third - order in space piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of @xcite and a constrained transport ( ct ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm for preserving the @xmath10  =  0 constraint .",

    "the @xmath36 boundary conditions are strictly periodic , whereas the @xmath37 boundaries are shearing periodic @xcite .",
    "the electromotive forces ( emfs ) at the radial boundaries are properly remapped to guarantee that the net vertical magnetic flux is strictly conserved to machine precision using ct @xcite .    as in paper",
    "i , ambipolar diffusion is implemented in a first - order operator - split manner using ct to preserve the divergence free condition with an additional step of remapping @xmath38 at radial shearing - box boundaries .",
    "the super time - stepping ( sts ) technique of @xcite has been implemented to accelerate our calculations ( see the appendix of paper i ) .",
    "the only algorithmic difference between these simulations and those in paper i lie with the vertical boundaries .",
    "the simulations in paper i used the outflow boundaries described in @xcite .",
    "we observed significant buildup of magnetic field near the vertical boundaries , which was a result of the density floor employed ( described below ) being too large ; the magnetic field was not able to buoyantly rise out of the disk . in this work ,",
    "we have modified the vertical boundary conditions for the horizontal magnetic field components in order to circumvent this problem .",
    "in particular , for the upper vertical boundary , the value of @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) in grid cell @xmath41 is    @xmath42    where @xmath43 refers to the last physical zone at the upper boundary .",

    "@xmath45 is extrapolated into the ghost zones using the value in the last physical zone with a standard zero gradient outflow boundary .",
    "we have found that this modification induces the removal of magnetic flux away from the mid - plane and out of the domain .",
    "the strength of ambipolar diffusion is characterized by the ambipolar elsasser number @xmath46    which corresponds to the number of times a neutral molecule collides with the ions in a dynamical time ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "as in paper i , we adopt the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) disk model with @xmath48 g @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath49 is the disk radius measured in au .",

    "we only consider @xmath57 au .    in paper",
    "i , the base of the fuv ionization layer was set to be at a fixed height assuming that the density profile follows hydrostatic equilibrium ( gaussian ) .",
    "this assumption was justified in these zero net vertical flux runs due to the extremely weak level of mri turbulence . however , with net flux , the density can differ substantially from gaussian due to enhanced magnetic pressure support . here , we identify the location of the base of the fuv ionization layer ( @xmath59and @xmath60 for top and bottom , respectively ) by integrating at each time step the horizontally averaged mass density from the boundary towards the mid - plane until @xmath61 is reached .",
    "we then use equation ( [ am_fuv ] ) to set the strength of ambipolar diffusion in the ionized surface layers of the disk . in the mid - plane region",
    "@xmath62 , we simply set am  =  1 .",
    "this is a good approximation if there are no very small ( pah - sized ) grains in this region @xcite .",
    "if pahs are present , the expected value of am is dependent on both the grain abundance and on the magnetic field strength .",
    "in this limit our adopted value of am  =  1 remains a reasonable approximation provided that the _ turbulent _",
    "@xmath63 , a value that is self - consistent with what we obtain in some of our runs .",
    "we note that it is conceivable that there could be circumstances in which grains are present and @xmath64 .",
    "this would result in @xmath65 and stronger ambipolar damping near the mid - plane . we can not study this regime numerically , however , because the courant - limited diffusive time step would be too small .    from these considerations , the value of am changes quite dramatically from am  =  1 to am @xmath66 at the base of the fuv layer .",
    "this very large transition is smoothed over roughly 7 grid zones so as to prevent a discontinuous transition in am .",
    "the smoothing functions we apply are based upon the error function ( erf ) .",
    "thus , the complete profile of am for these runs is given by    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the smoothing functions defined as    @xmath70    @xmath71    here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . these numbers were chosen to give a reasonably resolved transition region between am = 1 and @xmath74 .",
    "we also note that since @xmath75 in the above formula , the fuv photons effectively penetrate slightly deeper than @xmath59 and @xmath60 by about @xmath76 .",
    "we have run a series of simulations both in the ideal mhd limit ( used for convergence studies ; see below ) , and using the am profiles described in the previous section . aside from the am profile ,",

    "a density floor of @xmath85 is applied to the physical domain as too small a density leads to a large @xmath86 speed and a very small time step .",

    "one explanation for this behavior is that as the vertical magnetic field energy is increased ( though , the net vertical field remains the same ) , @xmath126 ( now defined by the turbulent magnetic field , and _ not _ the net vertical field ) reaches a regime where the mri is sufficiently well - resolved at all @xmath110 .",

    ", @xcite demonstrated that with strong ambipolar diffusion , the mri operates when the magnetic field is sufficiently weak : increasing the net field will first lead to an increase of the turbulence level , until the field is too strong for the mri to operate . above such threshold value of the field strength , the mri tends to be suppressed and the flow transitions toward a more laminar state , with stress dominated by large - scale components . in the case of ad30au1e3",
    ", the mri is initially activated , but the _ turbulent _ @xmath87 pushes the system into a regime where ambipolar diffusion quenches the mri .",

    "the main difference is that near the mid - plane , there is still weak turbulence ( e.g. , in the bottom left panel of figure 5 ) .",
    "this is because the ambipolar diffusion ( rather than ohmic resistivity ) dominated mid - plane region is still linearly unstable to the mri for moderate net vertical magnetic flux .",
    "another related issue is why ad30au1e4 shows strong mri turbulence , whereas ad30au1e4l does not .",

    "ad30au1e4 , on the other hand , has a larger ionized layer ( smaller am = 1 region ) ; this allows the @xmath86 speed to become small enough to permit the mri in this region . in both of these runs , the am = 1 region still remains weakly turbulent , consistent with our observation that the total @xmath86 speed and am values in this region are the same in the two different cases .      as noted above , runs ad30au1e3 and ad30au1e4l both have a wind - like structure to the magnetic field with some turbulence within the am = 1 region .",
    "this magnetic field geometry can remove angular momentum from the disk via a blandford - payne type of mechanism @xcite .",

    "we must note here , however , that because we are normalizing by mid - plane quantities in the definition of @xmath154 but by a volume average in the definition of @xmath155 , the values for the two different stresses can not be compared directly to one another .",
    "the local shearing - box approximation has the limitation that the radially inner and outer sides of the box are symmetric because curvature is ignored .",
    "this leads to two possible types of outflow geometry , depending on whether the outflow from the top and bottom sides of the box flow toward the same or opposite radial directions .",
    "the former case is termed as  even-@xmath110 \" symmetry , while the latter case is termed as ",
    "odd-@xmath110 \" symmetry ( see section 4.4 of @xcite for a thorough description ) .",

    "thus , these values should not be taken as exact , but as an approximate , order of magnitude estimate for the true stress values ; for the purposes of this paper , this is sufficient .",
    "because the region in which the mri is not as well resolved is smaller for the @xmath1 simulations than in the @xmath2 simulations , the above argument does not necessarily apply to ad30au1e4 and ad30au1e4l .",
    "we are not entirely sure why the stress levels are similar between these two calculations .",
    "one possibility is that due to the quasi - laminar wind - like nature of ad30au1e4l , the stress in the ambipolar damping zone is not as drastically different from the peak stress values ( near @xmath170 ) as in ad30au1e4 .",

    "this effect may very well equate to the height - averaged stress values being similar in the two @xmath1 runs .",

    "they found that first of all , net vertical magnetic flux is essential to drive rapid accretion consistent with observations .",
    "in addition , the mri can be completely suppressed in the inner disk up to about 10 au , with accretion purely driven by disk wind under the physical wind geometry .",
    "our simulations in paper i and this paper focus on the ambipolar diffusion dominated outer disk , with a similar conclusion that net vertical magnetic flux is essential . however , unlike the inner disk regions , the mri is likely the dominant driving mechanism of accretion in the outer disk .    finally , it is worth noting that our results are in general agreement with the work of @xcite , in which semi - analytic methods were employed to study angular momentum transport from both the mri _ and _ a magnetic wind .",
    "vertical fields can potentially transport angular momentum via a wind in addition to the mri , and the nature of the accretion flow depends on the strength of the vertical field .",

    "figure  [ mass ] shows the time evolution of the mass in our layered am simulations . for the weakest field case ,",
    "there is no mass loss .",
    "however , as @xmath0 is decreased , the mass loss rate grows ; at @xmath185 and 30 au , nearly half of the mass has been lost by orbit 30 .",
    "this behavior has been observed in other shearing box simulations incorporating a vertical net field geometry @xcite .    while this observed behavior is likely a physical result due to the launching of a magnetic wind ( and perhaps turbulent motions as well ) , we can not accurately quantify the mass loss rates in our local simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that as the vertical domain size is increased , the mass loss rate from the domain is reduced significantly .",
    "in particular , they found that as the vertical height is increased , the point at which the flow velocity equals the fast magnetosonic speed always lies at the edge of the vertical boundary .",
    "these considerations and similar arguments made by @xcite and @xcite suggest that global simulations are necessary to capture an accurate representation of vertical disk mass loss .    with that critical caveat ,",
    "however , it is clear that the mass loss rates seen here could be important for protoplanetary disk dispersal even if they are substantially overestimated .",

    "* ) , about 10% of the disk lifetime or @xmath187 orbits in the region between 30  au and 100  au .",

    "<S> we carry out a series of local , vertically stratified shearing box simulations of protoplanetary disks that include ambipolar diffusion and a net vertical magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the ambipolar diffusion profiles we employ correspond to 30au and 100au in a minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) disk model , which consists of a far - uv - ionized surface layer and low - ionization disk interior . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations serve as a follow up to @xcite , in which we found that without a net vertical field , the turbulent stresses that result from the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) are too weak to account for observed accretion rates . the simulations in this work </S>",
    "<S> show a very strong dependence of the accretion stresses on the strength of the background vertical field ; as the field strength increases , the stress amplitude increases . for a net vertical field strength ( quantified by @xmath0 , the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure at the disk mid - plane ) of @xmath1 and @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find accretion rates @xmath3@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these accretion rates agree with observational constraints , suggesting a vertical magnetic field strength of @xmath5200 @xmath6 g and 1030  @xmath6 g at 30 au and 100 au , respectively , in a mmsn disk . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the stress has a non - negligible component due to a magnetic wind . for sufficiently strong vertical field strengths , </S>",
    "<S> mri turbulence is quenched , and the flow becomes largely laminar , with accretion proceeding through large scale correlations in the radial and toroidal field components as well as through the magnetic wind . in all simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a low ionization region near the disk mid - plane , which we call the ambipolar damping zone , results in reduced stresses there . </S>"
