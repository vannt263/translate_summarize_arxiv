    "global warming is a major concern of the world , with its potentially devastating effects on coastal settlements and world agriculture .",
    "the steep rise in greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution has increased the co@xmath0  concentration in the atmosphere by 30% ( fig .",
    "[ fig_co2 ] ) .",
    "this is widely believed to be the dominant cause of the observed rise of about 0.6@xmath1c   in the global mean surface temperature during this period ( fig .",
    "[ fig_temp_vs_time ] ) @xcite .    a small systematic rise or fall in the global temperature is caused by a net imbalance ( `` forcing '' ) in the earth s energy radiation budget ( fig . [ fig_energy_budget ] ) .",
    "the radiative forcing caused by the increase in the co@xmath0  fraction since 1750 is estimated to be 1.5 wm@xmath2  @xcite , compared with the global average incoming solar radiation of 342 wm@xmath2 , i.e. an imbalance of only 0.4% . after including the effects of all greenhouse gases ( + 2.45 wm@xmath2 ) , aerosolsm diameter particles of liquid or solid in suspension .",
    "atmospheric aerosols include dust , sea salt , soot ( elemental carbon ) , organic compounds from biomass burning , sulphates ( especially ( nh@xmath3)@xmath4so@xmath3 ) from so@xmath4 , and nitrates from no and no@xmath4 .",
    "aerosol concentrations vary from a few per @xmath5 in clean maritime air to @xmath6 @xmath7 in highly - polluted city air . ] and their effects on clouds ( -0.75 wm@xmath2 ) , the present net radiative forcing from mankind is estimated to be 1.2 wm@xmath2 .    the climate models @xcite upon which the predictions of greenhouse warming depend have gradually improved as new effects and better data have been incorporated .",
    "they now provide a reasonable representation of the observed variation in global temperature over the last century ( fig .",
    "[ fig_temp_vs_time ] ) . however they remain subject to significant uncertainties , both from unknown processes and also from the unknown effects of feedback mechanisms which may amplify or damp a warming trend .",
    "important unknown effects include those due to increased evaporation of water ( which may cool due to an increased cloudiness or warm due to an increased greenhouse effect ) , shifts in the amount of co@xmath4 dissolved in the oceans , changes in the ocean currents and changes in the polar ice . given the uncertainties in these models , many scientists consider there is no convincing evidence at present to demonstrate that a greenhouse warming of the planet is in progress , let alone that the models can reliably predict future temperature changes ( the predicted rise by the end of the next century is 1.32.5@xmath1c ; fig . [ fig_temp_projection ] ) .",
    "nonetheless it is in this climate of scientific uncertainty that major political decisions on greenhouse gas emissions are presently being made ( earth summit in rio de janeiro , 1992 , and un climate convention in kyoto , 1997 ) that will have a profound effect on the economic development of both the developed and the developing countries .",
    "the need for such political decisions to be based on sound scientific grounds is self evident , and a major world - wide research effort on climate change is underway .",
    "an unexpected and important factor in climate change has recently been discovered : cloud cover seems to follow natural variations in the incident cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "however a direct link between cosmic rays and cloud formation has not been unambiguously established and , moreover , the microphysical mechanism is poorly understood .",
    "this presents particle physics with a unique opportunity to make a major contribution to the problem of global warming by confirming , or otherwise , this link under controlled conditions in a test beam .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an initial outline of the motivation and conceptual design of the proposed cloud ( cosmics leaving outdoor droplets ) detector .",
    "the earth s climate has not always been the same ; significant changes have occurred during recorded history and even greater changes have taken place since the human ancestral line began about 5 million years ago .",
    "the urgent questions facing science are why these natural changes took place and whether there is currently an influence of mankind on the climate .",
    "only when the natural causes are understood and properly accounted for in climate models can we expect meaningful results on the anthropogenic influences .    several natural effects are well established .",
    "these include the milankovitch cycles  variations in the earth s orbit , tilt and spin with respect to the sun  which seem to control the timing of glacials and interglacials .",
    "these cold and warm phases correspond to cycles of about 100,000 years and 10,000 years , respectively .",
    "( we are presently approaching the end of an interglacial ; sometime in the next 1000 years or so the climate will probably become much colder . )",
    "other important natural sources of climate change are the anomalous warm pacific current known as el nio , and volcanoes that pour ash into the stratosphere , reducing the radiation from the sun reaching the earth s surface .",
    "a recent volcanic example is mt .",
    "pinatubo in the philippines , which erupted in june 1991 and caused a global cooling , by up to 0.4@xmath1c , over a period of about 3 years .",
    "in contrast , a natural effect that has until recently been harder to understand is the apparent link between solar activity  the sunspot cycle  and the weather .      the observation that warm weather seems to coincide with high sunspot counts and cool weather with low sunspot counts",
    "was made as long ago as two hundred years by the astronomer william herschel who noticed that the price of wheat in england was lower when there were many sunspots , and higher when there were few .",
    "the most well - known example of this effect is known as the maunder minimum @xcite , the little ice age between 1645 and 1715which ironically almost exactly coincides with the reign of louis xiv , _",
    "le roi soleil _ , 16431715during",
    "which time there was an almost complete absence of sunspots ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sunspots_vs_time]a ) . during this period",
    "the river thames in london regularly froze across and fairs complete with swings , sideshows and food stalls were a standard winter feature .",
    "quantitative proof of a correlation between the sun s activity and the earth s temperature was presented by friis - christensen and lassen @xcite in 1991 .",
    "they used the sunspot cycle length as a measure of the sun s activity .",
    "the cycle length averages 11 years but has varied from 7 to 17 years ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sunspots_vs_time ] ) , with shorter cycle lengths corresponding to a more magnetically - active sun .",
    "a remarkably close agreement was found between the sunspot cycle length and the change in land temperature of the northern hemisphere in the period between 1861 and 1989 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sunspots_vs_temp ] ) .",
    "the land temperature of the northern hemisphere was used to avoid the lag by several years of air temperatures over the oceans , due to their large heat capacity .",
    "this figure covers the period during which greenhouse gas emissions are presumed to have caused a global warming of about 0.6@xmath1c .",
    "two features are of particular note : firstly the dip between 1945 and 1970 , which can not be explained by the steadily rising greenhouse gas emissions but seems well - matched to a decrease in the sun s activity , and secondly the close correspondence between the two curves over this entire period , which would seem to leave little room for an additional greenhouse gas effect .    in the absence of sufficiently sensitive measurements",
    ", people suspected that the sun s irradiance may be fluctuating over the solar cycle .",
    "however , from our knowledge of how the sun produces energy , this would seem difficult .",
    "radiation from the sun was created in the core and , in a random walk with a mean free path of about 10 cm , has taken about fifty million years to reach the surface .",
    "this would smooth out any substantial fluctuations in radiated energy on a timescale significantly less than about a million years . indeed",
    "the steadiness of the sun s irradiance over a complete sunspot cycle has recently been confirmed by satellite measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig_solar_irradiance ] @xcite ) .",
    "the solar flux is slightly higher at sunspot maximum ; although sunspots are cooler and have reduced emission , this is more than compensated by an associated increase in bright areas known as _",
    "plages _ and _ faculae_. the mean irradiance changes by about 0.1 % from sunspot maximum to minimum which , if representative over a longer time interval , is too small ( 0.3 wm@xmath2 , globally - averaged ) to account for the observed changes in the earth s temperature .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it has been recognised for several decades that the cosmic ray flux reaching the earth is strongly modulated by the solar wind ( @xmath8 0.0010.003 ) and an intensity of , generating a magnetic field of about @xmath9 gauss . ]",
    "which , in turn , is strongly influenced by the sunspot cycle ( fig . [ fig_cosmics_vs_sunspots ] ) . at times of high sunspot activity ,",
    "the solar wind is stronger and this partially shields the lower - energy galactic cosmic radiation from penetrating the inner solar system and reaching the earth .",
    "in addition , the lower - energy cosmic rays are affected by the geomagnetic field , which they must penetrate to reach the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the minimum vertical momentum of primary charged particles at the geomagnetic equator is about 15 gev / c , decreasing to below 0.1 gev / c at the geomagnetic poles .",
    "the modulation of the cosmic ray flux incident on the earth s atmosphere at the higher geomagnetic latitudes is as large as 50% between sunspot maxima and minima @xcite .",
    "it represents one of the largest measurable effects of sunspot activity near the earth s surface .    but how could cosmic rays affect the earth s weather ?",
    "the breakthrough was made by svensmark and friis - christensen in 1997 @xcite who showed a striking correlation between global cloud cover and the incident cosmic ray flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig_clouds_vs_cosmics ] ) .",
    "moreover , the cloud cover was found to have a poorer correlation with variations in the solar microwave flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig_clouds_vs_cosmics ] ) .",
    "the latter is known to follow closely variations in the total solar irradiance , soft x - rays and ultraviolet rays .",
    "the modulation in cloud cover was found to be more pronounced at higher geomagnetic latitudes , consistent with the reduced shielding effect of the earth s magnetic field at higher latitudes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cosmics_vs_sunspots ] ) .    over a sunspot cycle ,",
    "the absolute variation in global cloud cover is about 3% ( equivalent to 4.8% relative fraction ) , and the variation in the neutron flux is about 1520% ( for a primary charged particle cutoff of 3 gev ) .",
    "the neutrons are mostly produced by primary hadronic interactions in the first 12 @xmath10 of the atmosphere and therefore measure the changes in cosmic ray intensity at altitudes above about 13 km .",
    "the primary cosmic radiation is about 80% protons , 15% he nuclei and 5% heavier nuclei . at sea level",
    "the most numerous _ charged _ particles are muons and their fluctuation is less pronounced , about 3% over a solar cycle @xcite , since they are produced from a stiffer primary spectrum of cosmic radiation , which is therefore less affected by the solar wind .    [",

    "the currently - accepted physical processes that affect the production of cloud condensation nuclei @xcite , including both aerosols and ice particles , do not consider ion - induced effects .",
    "the new satellite observations suggest that the ions or radicals produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays may somehow be affecting the nucleation , growth or activation of atmospheric aerosols , or the creation of ice particles .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the total cloud fraction that may be caused by cosmic rays .",
    "it is not yet known at which altitude the cosmic radiation may be affecting clouds , i.e. whether the clouds more closely follow the amplitude modulation of the neutron flux ( 20% ) or of the muon flux ( 3% ) .",
    "however , making the most conservative assumption , a 20% change in cosmic ray flux causes a 4.8% relative change in cloud cover .",
    "if the cloud - forming process is directly proportional to cosmic flux then this suggests about 25% of the earth s clouds could be affected by cosmic rays . however ,",
    "if the process is proportional to ion density then the fraction is twice as large , since a 20% increase in cosmic ray flux leads to a 10% increase in equilibrium ion density ( see section [ sec_ions ] ) . in summary , a large fraction of the earth s clouds could be affected by cosmic radiation .

    "there is no indication which clouds may be affected by cosmic rays , so we will assume for the present estimate that all are affected equally .",
    "present estimates from the earth radiation budget experiment ( erbe ) indicate , overall , that clouds reflect more energy than they trap , leading to a net cooling of 28 wm@xmath2  from the mean global cloud cover of 63% ( table [ tab_erbe ] @xcite ) .",
    "the 4.8% relative variation in cloud cover due to variations of the cosmic ray flux over a solar cycle therefore implies a change in the earth s radiation budget of 1.3  wm@xmath2   ( 0.4% of the total incident solar radiation ) . this is a significant effect :",
    "in the 3-year period 19871990 , the effect of the reduction in cosmic ray flux was comparable to the total estimated radiative forcing of 1.5  wm@xmath2   from the increase in co@xmath4 concentration since 1750 .",
    ".global annual mean forcing due to various types of clouds , from the earth radiation budget experiment ( erbe ) @xcite .",

    "the electrons are rapidly captured by electronegative gases , which become negatively charged as a result .",

    "the lifetime of an ion is @xmath31 .",
    "this implies ion lifetimes in the troposphere of about 69 min . in still air , the ions drift vertically in the electric field created by the negatively - charged earth and the positively - charged ionosphere .",

    "brownian motion will dominate over gravitational fall when the projected brownian displacement is about equal to the droplet radius @xmath40 in the time the droplet would have taken to fall a distance @xmath40 .",
    "this indicates that brownian displacement is comparable to gravitational displacement at a droplet radius of about 0.7 @xmath47 m , and below this value droplets will remain suspended for extended periods .    in summary ,",
    "in order to allow for the possibility of long formation times in the atmosphere , the cloud detector should have the capability to observe droplet growth over periods of up to about 10 min , i.e. comparable to the ion lifetime , and the dimensions of the chamber should allow for a fiducial volume that is approximately 10 cm away from any boundary .",
    "this indicates a chamber dimension of about @xmath53 @xmath54 is appropriate .",
    "the basic purpose of the cloud detector ( fig .  [ fig_detector ] ) is to confirm , or otherwise , a direct link between cosmic rays and cloud formation by measuring droplet formation in a controlled test - beam environment .",
    "the cloud detector is essentially a cloud chamber that is designed to duplicate the gases , water vapour , aerosols and temperature / pressure conditions found in the earth s troposphere .    since the microphysical mechanisms responsible for cloud formation by cosmic rays are poorly understood , it is necessary for the experimental tests to cover a broad range of variables and conditions .",
    "for instance , it is not yet even known at which _ altitude _",
    "( i.e. temperature and pressure conditions ) the clouds are being formed .",
    "also , since the maximum water vapour supersaturation in the troposphere is only about one per cent , droplet growth times may be quite long , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the combined effects of ionisation and aerosols / ice particles is probably important ( section[sec_cloud_formation ] ) .",
    "the ionisation of _ existing _ water droplets by charged particles requires study ; charged droplets have a lower vapour pressure and will therefore grow at the expense of uncharged droplets .",
    "it is important to measure the sensitivity to a range of track ionisation densities , @xmath55 , and ion pair concentrations that duplicates those of cosmic rays .",
    "this indicates the need for beam particles ranging from protons to heavy ions .",
    "finally , an investigation should be made of the possibility that droplets are formed in relatively  rare events \" , such as very highly charged ions or droplets , perhaps due to heavy nuclei .",
    "cloud chamber data under these conditions have never been previously obtained .",
    "although c.t.r .",
    "wilson s cloud chamber was extensively developed in the first half of this century , it was optimised for experimental particle physics and operated under conditions far removed from those of the troposphere .      the cloud detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig_detector ] ) comprises the following main components :    * a temperature - controlled cloud chamber that can be operated in the temperature range -60@xmath1c  to 30@xmath1c  and at pressures from a vacuum to 1.5 atm .",
    "the upper pressure limit is to allow for adiabatic expansions down to a final pressure of 1 atm .",
    "an electrode structure ( field cage ) in the cloud chamber provides a simple clearing field for measurements with low residual ionisation . * a surrounding liquid bath enclosed by super - insulation to provide stable and precise temperature conditions for the cloud chamber .",
    "a temperature stability of about 0.01  k is required since this is equivalent to a change of water vapour supersaturation by about 0.05% .",
    "the investigation of long growth times for the droplets requires that the operating conditions be held steady for long periods .",
    "the temperature is adjusted by heat - exchange coils immersed in a suitable liquid coolant in the bath and connected to a he compressor .",
    "the temperature of the circulating he is controlled by temperature monitors immersed in the coolant . * a piston to provide adiabatic expansions for investigating rapid droplet growth times .",
    "small piston expansions and compressions also provide a technique for fine control of the water vapour supersaturation in the cloud chamber . *",
    "an optical system comprising illumination and stereo microscope cameras ( recuperated from old bubble chamber equipment ) which can be operated with film or ccd readout .",
    "the latter is to allow direct digitization of the data for analysis .",
    "the illumination and optical system must be capable of detecting and measuring water droplets of sizes down to a minimum of about 0.5 @xmath47 m , i.e. the smallest that can scatter light and therefore constitute a cloud .",

    "* presence of aerosols and trace condensable vapours .",
    "* presence of frozen droplets .",
    "* presence of existing water droplets . * particle flux and ionisation density ( p , heavy ions  ) . * time for droplet growth .",
    "* understanding of the microphysical processes * involved in cloud formation by ionising radiation .",
    "this will involve monte carlo simulation of the processes and a comparison with the cloud results .",
    "* estimation of the global cloud cover * due to cosmic rays , using atmospheric data recorded by satellite experiments .",
    "the observation of an apparent connection between cosmic rays and global climate offers a unique opportunity for particle physics to make a major contribution to the problem of global warming  at a relatively modest cost .",
    "the proposed cloud experiment will unambiguously confirm , or otherwise , a direct link between cosmic radiation and cloud formation , and allow a quantitative understanding of the physical processes involved .",
    "this , in turn , would provide an unambiguous and physically explicable connection between solar and climatic variability  representing a great advance in the understanding of the relationship between the earth and its star .",
    "although this experiment primarily addresses atmospheric science , it is clearly in the domain of particle physics and of cern s expertise and experimental facilities .",
    "the cloud experiment will have the immediate impact of potentially resolving one of the important unknown effects that may have so far prevented reliable calculations of global warming from greenhouse gases  an issue of profound economic and social importance to the world .",
    "furthermore , if the link is confirmed , then it may eventually become possible to make long - term predictions of systematic changes in the earth s climate , by monitoring and predicting the evolution of the cosmic ray flux and the `` geomagnetic climate '' of the sun and earth that modulates its intensity .",
