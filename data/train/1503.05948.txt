    "the experimental neutrino mixing data show that the neutrino mixing is very different from the quark mixing . in the usual parametrization of the neutrino mixing matrix",
    "( see for instance  @xcite ) , experimental data suggest that the angle @xmath3 is small ( but nonzero ) , and @xmath4 is close to @xmath5  @xcite .    there is lot of effort spent on finding an organizing principle for the flavor puzzle .",
    "a general approach is to study finite subgroups of su(3 ) which have an irreducible triplet representation ; see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "examples of subgroups with triplet representations are @xmath6 , the group of permutations of 4 elements , with two singlet , one doublet , and two triplet representations ( see for instance @xcite ) ; or @xmath7 , the group of even permutations of 4 elements which has also a triplet representation besides singlet representations ( see for instance  @xcite ) ; or @xmath8 , with 27 elements and two triplet representations ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , here we want to study in detail the higgs potential of a three higgs - boson - doublet model which imposes a @xmath9 symmetry  without any irreducible triplet representation .",
    "let us closely follow the motivation of  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is a neutrino mass matrix which is symmetric in generations two and three , @xmath10 this mass matrix may be diagonalized as usual , that is , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the neutrino mixing matrix and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 the neutrino masses . expressing the mixing matrix @xmath12 in terms of the usual parametrization  @xcite , we get in particular @xmath2 and @xmath16 . even though the experimental results are not in exact agreement with these values , in particular @xmath3 is nonzero , they at least appear to be approximately fulfilled .",
    "we note that deviations from these approximate values for the mixing angles could arise by soft - symmetry - breaking terms or beyond - leading - order effects ; see for instance the study in @xcite .",
    "the mass matrix   may be generated by the introduction of three higgs - boson doublets  @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and a symmetry @xmath19 , where all elementary particles are assigned to an appropriate transformation behavior on this symmetry .",
    "the reflection symmetry  @xmath20 is responsible for the @xmath21@xmath22 symmetry of @xmath23 : @xmath24 with  @xmath25 one of the fields on the right - hand side of the table transforming as @xmath26 with the corresponding phase  @xmath27 given explicitly in the table .",
    "all other fields transform trivially .    by virtue of these symmetries  besides the electroweak symmetry ",
    "there appear in particular the invariant yukawa couplings @xmath28    the most general potential for the three higgs - boson doublets @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 reads @xmath32 where the term @xmath33 breaks the @xmath34 symmetry explicitly but softly , since this is a quadratic term . for a nonvanishing parameter @xmath35 in this way additional goldstone bosons",
    "are avoided , which otherwise would appear by spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "this potential has nine real parameters and one complex parameter  @xmath36 , corresponding to eleven real parameters in total .",
    "now we want to discuss stability , stationarity , and electroweak symmetry breaking of this model . of course only a model with a stable potential ,",
    "having the correct - electroweak - symmetry - breaking behavior and the correct vacuum expectation values is physically acceptable .",
    "these obvious constraints restrict the parameter space of the potential . here , we focus on the higgs potential and not on any further experimental limits . for instance , the expressions for the _ oblique parameters _",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath12 are available for any nhdm  @xcite and may be compared to the electroweak precision data .",
    "since the @xmath0 model is a 3hdm we encounter in this model four charged higgs bosons and in total five neutral higgs bosons .",
    "we expect a changed phenomenology of this model compared to the standard model .",
    "of course , the detection of any further higgs boson would be a clear signal for a model beyond the standard model .",
    "depending on the yukawa coupling strength in ( 1.5 ) we have for instance the signature of the production of a charged higgs boson with subsequent decay into a muon and a muon - neutrino .",
    "the potential itself is in principle detectable via its trilinear and quartic higgs self - couplings .",
    "we leave this investigation for future work and focus here on the study of the higgs potential with respect to stability , electroweak symmetry breaking and the global minimum .    even though the potential   appears",
    "to be rather involved we will see that it is indeed accessible in the bilinear approach  @xcite . in this",
    "approach gauge degrees of freedom are avoided systematically .",
    "moreover , the corresponding equations for stability and stationarity simplify in particular , the degree of systems of equations is lowered .",
    "recently , the bilinear approach for the study of stability , stationarity , and electroweak symmetry breaking has been extended to the study of any 3hdm  @xcite , which we now briefly review .",
    "the scalar products of the type @xmath39 , @xmath40 , in the potential   may be arranged in a @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 by the introduction of the bilinears , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the @xmath41  gell - mann matrices , the following replacements can be made in the potential : @xmath45 comparing the potential , written in terms of bilinears @xmath46 with the general form of the potential , we find the new parameters    @xmath47    obviously , all parameters are real in terms of bilinears .",
    "we note that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the higgs - boson doublets and the bilinear matrix @xmath48 with rank smaller or equal to two - except for irrelevant gauge degrees of freedom ; see @xcite .",
    "supposing the potential is bounded from below , at the global minimum , or the degenerate minima , the gradient of the potential has to vanish .",
    "the corresponding equations may be used to fix some of the parameters . in order to obtain these equations",
    "we start with the parametrization of the three higgs - boson doublets with the same hypercharge @xmath49 , in a particular gauge , @xmath50 the derivatives of the potential  , inserting with respect to the fields at the vacuum , that is , for vanishing fields give the nontrivial conditions @xmath51 for nonvanishing vacuum expectation values , the last two equations immediately dictate that  @xmath36 has to be real . eventually , by means of the equations   the quadratic parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath35 may be expressed by the quartic parameters and the three vacuum expectation values @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "further , the vacuum expectation values are restricted with view on the yukawa couplings  , that is , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values @xmath54 and @xmath55 has to be @xmath57 at tree - level accuracy .",
    "in addition , the vacuum expectation value @xmath58 is given by the electroweak precision data .",
    "therefore , all quadratic parameters follow from the quartic parameters and one free vacuum expectation value , say  @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , it appears reasonable to start with the following set of parameters , @xmath59 note that the tadpole conditions   only ensure that there is at least one stationary solution . by no means",
    "does this guarantee that the corresponding potential is stable and has a global minimum with the correct partially broken electroweak symmetry .",
    "in this section we analyze the potential of the @xmath0 model while varying two of its parameters . starting with the parameters we fix the quadratic parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath35 by .",
    "quantitatively , we choose the quartic parameters motivated by the central point given in  @xcite with a variation of the two parameters @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] in steps of @xmath62 : @xmath63 , \\ ; a_2 \\in [ -3,3 ] , \\ ; a_3=-5 , \\ ; a_4=-0.0474 , \\\\ & a_5=1.5 , \\ ; a_6=2 , \\ ; a_7=3 , \\\\ & v_1/v_2 = 105.66/1776.82 , \\ ; v_3 = v_0/\\sqrt{2 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] with the masses of the muon , @xmath64 , and tau , @xmath65 , given in @xcite .",
    "the central point in particular passes the electroweak precision observables  for details , see  @xcite .",
    "first , we study the stability of the potential .",
    "therefore , we separate the potential into the quadratic and quartic parts @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 given by @xmath69 with the vector components @xmath70 , @xmath71 defined for @xmath72 . for @xmath73 the potential vanishes .",
    "the stationary points of  @xmath74 corresponding to a matrix @xmath75 with rank  2 are obtained from @xmath76 = 0,\\\\   & \\det ( \\sqrt{2/3 } { \\mathbbm{1}}_3 + k_a \\lambda_a ) = 0 , \\\\ & 2- k_a k_a > 0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the stationary points corresponding to a matrix @xmath75 with rank  1 are obtained from @xmath77 = 0,\\\\ & { \\boldsymbol{w}}^\\dagger { \\boldsymbol{w } } - 1 = 0 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we express the vector components @xmath78 by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 are three - component complex vectors .",
    "if we have for all real solutions @xmath78 of the systems of polynomial equations and @xmath82 , or at least @xmath83 but then in addition @xmath84 , the potential is stable . in other words , if there is for a given initial parameter set one solution with @xmath85 or @xmath83 but in addition @xmath86 the potential is unstable .",
    "the unstable cases for the variation of parameters   are denoted by the larger full disks ( blue ) in fig .",
    "[ a1a2 ] . for all other values of parameters",
    "the potential is stable .",
    "let us note that the quartic parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 appear as coefficients of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , in the potential  .",
    "therefore it is evident that the potential is unstable for small values of @xmath87 and too negative values for @xmath88 .",
    "+ having determined parameter sets giving a stable potential we proceed with the study of the stationary points in these cases .",
    "we systematically look for all stationary points of the potential . to this end",
    "we have to solve the following systems of polynomial equations , corresponding to solutions which break electroweak symmetry partially ( conserving the elecromagnetic symmetry ) , and solutions which break the electroweak symmetry completely .",
    "the stationary solutions with full electroweak symmetry breaking , corresponding to stationarity matrices @xmath91 of rank  2 are obtained from @xmath92 = 0 , \\\\    & 2 k_0 ^ 2 - k_a k_a > 0,\\\\   & \\det({\\underline{k}})=0,\\\\ & k_0 > 0 . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the stationary solutions with partial electroweak symmetry breaking , corresponding to stationarity matrices @xmath93 of rank  1 are obtained from @xmath94= 0,\\\\ & { \\boldsymbol{w}}^\\dagger   { \\boldsymbol{w } } -1 = 0,\\\\ & k_0 > 0 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we express the bilinears @xmath95 in terms of @xmath96 and the three component complex vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath97 in and , @xmath98 is a lagrange multiplier , respectively .",
    "in addition there is always a solution for a vanishing potential , corresponding to an unbroken electroweak symmetry .",
    "the global minimum , that is , the vacuum , is given by the stationary point or points with the deepest potential value .        in case",
    "this solution originates from the set  , that is , when we do have electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath99 , we can directly calculate the vacuum - expectation value of this minimum , @xmath100 , and verify that it coincides with .    depending on the variation of the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "we detect the viable global minima .",
    "these cases are marked by little ( green ) dots in fig .",
    "[ a1a2 ] . in case",
    "the deepest potential value does not correspond to the correct electroweak symmetry breaking or does not give the correct vacuum expectation value , these parameter points are denoted by a circle ( red ) in fig .",
    "[ a1a2 ] .",
    "as we can see by the scattering of points , we typically find valid parameters for @xmath87 and @xmath88 not too small .",
    "however , the pattern of valid points appears very sensitive to the parameter values .",
    "this , of course , is a consequence of the rather involved potential  .",
    "eventually , let us remark on the technical aspects to solve the rather involved systems of equations - on the one hand for the study of stability  , , and on the other hand for the study of stationarity  , .",
    "we apply for all the polynomial systems of equations the homotopy continuation approach as implemented in the phcpack package  @xcite . for a brief introduction to the homotopy continuation method ,",
    "see for instance  @xcite .    in the case of the systems of equations ,",
    ", we decompose the three component complex vectors @xmath81 , @xmath80 into real and imaginary parts . in turn",
    "we split every equation in the sets into real and imaginary parts . in this way",
    ", all indeterminants in all systems of equations have to be real , and we discard all nonreal solutions . practically , we treat any solution as real if the imaginary part of any of the inderminants has an amount smaller than  0.001 .",
    "let us study some details of the potential in case it has the correct electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath101 .",
    "this is conveniently done in a new basis @xmath102 in which only the field @xmath103 gets a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath104 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath12 is determined by two rotation angles , which have to fulfill @xmath105 with @xmath106 , @xmath107 $ ] and we have in particular @xmath108 . in the new basis ,",
    "the bilinear parameter vector @xmath109 from becomes    @xmath110    the correct global minimum has , in terms of these parameter components , the potential value @xmath111 this result serves as a good cross - check of the numerical study .",
    "in particular , the potential value at vacuum has to be nonpositive in order not to lie above the unbroken minimum , which is given by a vanishing potential .",
    "the physical higgs bosons follow from the diagonalization of the charged and neutral squared higgs mass matrices .",
    "the neutral field of the third higgs boson @xmath31 , that is , @xmath112 , is a mass eigenstate if the parameters fulfill @xmath113 therefore with a view on , we find the explicit conditions for the @xmath0 model , where the neutral component @xmath112 is _ aligned _ with the vacuum expectation value .",
    "the mass squared of the neutral component is in this case @xmath114 _ alignment _ thus requires that either @xmath115 or @xmath116 which is not the case , since the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values @xmath54 and @xmath55 is fixed by the ratio of the muon and tau masses , and a nonvanishing parameter @xmath35 is required in order to break the @xmath0 symmetry softly .",
    "let us comment on the neutrino mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath16 .",
    "since these values seem not to be exactly fulfilled experimentally , we mention that deviations may be achieved by imposing further soft - breaking terms in the potential .",
    "we have seen that the value and the nature of the global minimum is rather sensitive to small changes of the potential .",
    "therefore , we expect that definite results would require a separate study of the changed potential .",
    "however , since additional soft - breaking terms do not affect the quartic part of the potential , and , in particular , we have found that for large parts of parameter space stability follows from the quartic terms alone , we expect stability also in the respective cases of a potential imposing additional soft - breaking terms .",
    "we would like to mention that the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath117 , and @xmath36 couple the neutral boson @xmath112 with the other two generations of doublets .",
    "in general this may lead to changed phenomenology in higgs boson production and decay of the @xmath112 field .",
    "for some investigation of this we refer to @xcite .",
    "a further detailed study for instance , with respect to a possible enhancement of the @xmath112 decay rate into a pair of photons is left for future work .",
    "the @xmath0 model  @xcite introduces three higgs - boson doublets accompanied by an appropriate assignment of the elementary particles to irreducible representations of the group . in this way a neutrino mass matrix is generated which corresponds to mixing angles which are close to the experimental measurements .",
    "however , even though the symmetry restricts the model , the higgs potential appears to be rather involved .",
    "nevertheless , the recently introduced methods to study any three - higgs doublet model  @xcite were applied to study the potential in detail .",
    "we have investigated stability , the stationary points , and electroweak symmetry breaking of the higgs potential by solving the corresponding stationary equations , employing polynomial homotopy continuation .",
    "the method numerically finds all the isolated complex solutions out of which we have extracted the physical real solutions .",
    "we have scanned over a range of values of the potential parameters .",
    "as expected , for too low values of the quartic parameters typically an unstable potential is encountered . for parameter values , corresponding to a stable potential , the global minimum was detected .",
    "our study reveals that in this model there are viable parameters corresponding to a stable global minimum with correct electroweak symmetry breaking .",
