    "a large number of recent observational data , including type ia supernovae @xcite , large scale structure @xcite and cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite , baryon accoustic oscillations @xcite have provided evidences for a spatially flat universe which suffered two accelerated phases - an early acceleration phase ( inflation ) , which occurred prior to the radiation dominated era and a recently initiated present time accelerated expansion .",
    "this late time accelerated expansion is attributed to a mysterious exotic matter with large negative pressure called _ dark energy_. the nature of dark energy is unknown but the feature of dark energy is that it remains unclustered at all scales whereas gravitational clustering of baryons and nonbaryonic cold dark matter can be seen .",
    "the combined analysis of the different cosmological observations suggests that the universe consists of about 70 % dark energy , 25 % dark matter and 5% baryons and radiation .",
    "as the origin of dark energy is unknown , so several candidates have been proposed to describe it .",
    "the simplest choice for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this so - called @xmath1cdm model is able to explain most of the current observational data .",
    "but it suffers from two problems - _ coincidence problem _ and _ fine tuning problem_. the lack of a reasonable explanation for the cosmological constant problems has led researchers to explore other routes to explain the observations .",
    "so dynamical dark energy models have been proposed as alternatives in the literature . a wide class of scalar field models",
    "have been introduced to model dark energy .",
    "scalar field models including _ quintessence _",
    "@xcite , _ _ k - essence__@xcite , tachyon etc have attracted lots of attention @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider a frw model of the universe which contains three types of matter - dark matter , dark energy and baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "the dark matter is in form of dust .",
    "the dark energy is described by a scalar field and the baryons are described by a perfect fluid . as a scalar field",
    "can be considered to be a perfect fluid in effect , so the matter in the universe is considered in terms of two perfect fluids and a dust .",
    "all three fluids are assumed to be self - interacting and minimally coupled to gravity . + we will study the model qualitatively and will check for viable cosmological solution considering cosmological constraints and observational data . from einstein s field equations along with klein gordan equation we form an autonomous system . in order to study the dynamical character of the system , critical points are obtained and corresponding cosmological models are analyzed .",
    "feasible cosmological solutions should depict our present universe as global attractor i.e all the possible initial conditions lead to the observed percentages of dark energy and dark matter , and once reached , they remain fixed forever . for this reason we will focus on the stability of critical points i.e cosmological models which are attractors . for theoretical details of dynamical system method",
    "we would suggest to go through the books @xcite . + the paper is organized as follows :",
    "next section describes the basic equations and physical background of the model .",
    "section iii describes formation of autonomous system .",
    "phase space analysis for both 3d and 2d autonomous system are discussed in detail in section iv .",
    "summary is written in section v.",
    "the standard cosmology suggests that our universe went through the radiation dominated era , followed by matter dominated phase and then according to recent observations the universe is going through an accelerated expansion . for consistence any theoretical model should coincide with the history of the universe . the homogeneous and isotropic flat frw space time is chosen as the model of the universe .",
    "the universe is assumed to be filled up with non interacting _ dark matter _ , _ dark energy _ and _",
    "baryon_. dark matter is considered in the form of dust having energy density @xmath2 and dark energy is driven by a scalar field @xmath3 with potential @xmath4 whose energy density and pressure is given by @xmath5 respectively .",
    "we will have quintessence ( real @xmath6 ) if @xmath7 or phantom field ( imaginary @xmath6 ) if @xmath8 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath9 here .",
    "baryonic matter _ is described by a perfect fluid with linear equation of state @xmath10 where @xmath11 are density and pressure of the fluid and satisfies @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the adiabatic index of the fluid .",
    "in particular @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to dust matter and radiation respectively .",
    "all three fluids interact minimally .",
    "+ the einstein field equations can be written as ( here @xmath16 is gravitational constant , c = 1 ) @xmath17 @xmath18 where h is the hubble parameter .",
    "+ klein - gordan equation for the scalar field is @xmath19    the energy conservation relations take the form @xmath20    from ( [ eqn(5 ) ] ) we get , @xmath21 , a is an integration constant , a(t) is scale factor of the universe . equation ( [ eqn(7 ) ] ) implies that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "+ now from ( [ eqn(2 ) ] ) , ( [ eqn(3 ) ] ) and ( [ eqn(4 ) ] ) , we obtain the system of equations as @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "the above evolution equations are highly non - linear , so we will study our cosmological model qualitatively . at first we will formulate an autonomous system from ( [ eqn(8)])- ( [ eqn(10 ) ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the properties and cosmological consequences based on the existence , stability of critical points and value of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we employ the dimensionless variables @xcite , @xmath28    it is conventional to write fractional energy densities as @xmath29    now the friedmann equation ( [ eqn(8 ) ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath30    from ( [ eqn(9 ) ] ) , we have @xmath31 now , @xmath32",

    "+ the effective equation of state for this three fluid model has the expression @xmath36 for cosmic acceleration , @xmath37 is required .",
    "+ the equation state for dark energy is given by @xmath38 and the density parameter for the scalar field is @xmath39 it should be noted that the physical region in the phase plane is constrained by the requirement that the energy density be non - negative i.e @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "so ( [ eqn(15 ) ] ) restricts the dependent variables x and y to be on the circular cylinder @xmath42 .",
    "the equality sign indicates that there is no longer any dark matter .",
    "we assume @xmath43 = constant i.e potential of the scalar field is exponential , then we can write @xmath44 = constant = @xmath45 ( say ) .",

    ", the critical points need to satisfy ( [ eqn(15 ) ] ) for validity .",
    "clearly , ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) is a critical point .",
    "other critical points are ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( -1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , @xmath50 )  if @xmath14 and ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "we notice that in table v and vi ( fig 3 and fig 4 ) @xmath61 or @xmath62 are stable nodes and these points describe late time acceleration .",
    "table vii , viii ( fig 5 and fig 6 ) give critical points @xmath63 or @xmath64 which are also stable node though late time acceleration is not possible for these points .",
    "table ix ( fig 7 ) gives the same critical point as in table v. all the critical points listed here like @xmath65 , @xmath61 represent dark energy dominated universe .",
    "we need to remember @xmath66 represents contracting universe .",
    "this type of solution will remain invalid .",
    "we can see that in three dimension no viable cosmological solution exists which satisfy both dark energy domination and late time acceleration .",
