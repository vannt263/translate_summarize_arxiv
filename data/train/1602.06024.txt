    "primordial fluctuations of matter produced quantum mechanically during inflation  @xcite elegantly explains the origin of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and the large scale structure of our present universe . on top of the primordial fluctuations of matter , it is well known that inflation quantum mechanically generates fluctuations of spacetime , so called primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the current constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath0 comes from the observation of the cmb .",
    "the latest joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data provided an upper limit on the tensor - to - scalar ratio as  @xmath1  at @xmath2 confidence level @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves is directly related to the energy scale of inflation .",
    "the energy scale probed by the cmb observations is around the scale of grand unification theory ( gut ) , @xmath3gev .",
    "hence , once primordial gravitational waves were detected , they would be a powerful probe of the physics in early universe such as the gut , supergravity , and superstring theoy .    from the perspective of the rapid progress of cosmological observations , it is necessary to adapt inflation to the percent level precision of observations .",
    "this should be done based on fundamental theory . as a consequence",
    ", it is expected that qualitatively new phenomena in inflation are found and those should be probed by primordial gravitational waves . since supergravity is the low energy limit of superstring theory and the gut",
    "might be embedded into supergravity , it is legitimate to investigate inflation based on supergravity .",
    "indeed , there have been a lot of efforts to construct models based on supergravity  @xcite .",
    "however , in the previous study , the gauge sector in supergravity has been overlooked .",
    "in fact , it was legitimate to truncate the gauge sector because it apparently gives rise to tiny effects on observables .",
    "from the point of view of precision cosmology , however , it is worth exploring the role of the gauge sector in inflation . in supergravity",
    ", there exists a complex scalar field , we call its real part a dilaton and its imaginary part an axion .",
    "these two scalar fields are candidates for an inflaton and their couplings to the gauge sector are of our interest .",
    "there are two ways how an inflaton field is coupled to the gauge field .",
    "one is the dilaton coupling to the gauge field through a gauge kinetic function .",
    "the other is an axion coupling to the gauge field .",
    "thus , the issue to be clarified is if we can probe the gauge sector in inflation with the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "once we introduce the dilaton field and its gauge kinetic function , inspired by supergravity , there are interesting phenomenologies such as the generation of primordial magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "in particular , recently , it has been found that a non - trivial gauge - kinetic function could trigger the growth of the gauge field which stops at the saturating point and the amplitude of the gauge field is sustained during inflation  @xcite .",
    "the survived gauge field results in the statistical anisotropy in the primordial fluctuations @xcite . in the abelian gauge field cases ,",
    "it accompanies anisotropic inflation  @xcite . in the non - abelian gauge field cases ,",
    "the isotropic configuration is an attractor  @xcite .",
    "however , since its convergence is quite slow , there would appear the statistical anisotropy depending on the initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can expect the cross correlation between gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on top of the statistical anisotropy in auto correlation of gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to generate gravitational waves from the particle production of gauge fields by the dilaton  @xcite .    in the presence of the axion coupling during inflation",
    ", there occurs the transient tachyonic instability in one of helicity modes of the gauge field near the horizon - crossing .",
    "remarkably , the parity violating gauge field produces the circular polarization of gravitational waves , namely chiral gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "we can test this interesting outcome by observing the correlation between cmb temperature anisotropy and b - mode polarization @xcite , or by analyzing the residual signal of pulsar - timing arrays @xcite . in the case of the abelian gauge field , however , the gauge field also produces curvature perturbations with large non - gaussianity . as a result , this effect easily violates the current observational bounds on the non - gaussianity of the cmb anisotropies@xcite .",
    "more seriously , the strong interaction of the axion to the gauge field breaks perturbative descriptions in the in - in formalism @xcite . these constraints severely constrain amplitudes of chiral gravitational waves and make them invisible on cmb scales . in the case of the non - abelian gauge field , there is another effect of the axion coupling .",
    "indeed , the interaction of the axion with the non - abelian gauge field gives rise to an effective hubble friction , and generates a slow - roll inflationary solution for a wide range of parameters  @xcite(see also related models  @xcite ) . in the presence of the background gauge field , the non - abelian gauge field perturbations have tensor perturbations and one of circular polarization states experiences the tachyonic instability near the horizon crossing , which produces chiral gravitational waves .",
    "however , this inflation model is in conflict with cmb observations because either the spectral index of the curvature perturbations is too red or gravitational waves are produced too much  @xcite .",
    "this result stems from the fact that the strength of the interaction between the axion and the gauge field is almost constant during inflation .",
    "hence , sizable chiral primordial gravitational waves can not be reconciled with the constraints on cmb scales .    as we have explained in",
    "the above , recent works have revealed roles of two types of the coupling between the inflaton and the gauge field separately . from the point of view of supergravity , however , we should incorporate both the dilaton and the axion into a model at the same time . in this paper , we will focus on this possibility and find a novel effect induced by the presence of both couplings , which can be probed by primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the point is that the gauge kinetic function of the dilaton makes the gauge field increase and controlls the strength of the axion - gauge field interaction . as initial conditions ,",
    "we choose the gauge field small enough so that we can ignore an effective coupling of the axion to the gauge field in the early stage of inflation .",
    "therefore , the tachyonic instability plays no role when primordial fluctuations on cmb scales are generated .",
    "however , the gauge field grows due to the dilaton coupling through the gauge kinetic function until the non - linear effect of gauge field appears in the background dynamics .",
    "eventually , the gauge field settles in an attractor and realizes delayed chromo - natural inflation  @xcite in the late stage of inflation , remarkably , sizable chiral gravitational waves are generated only on small scales , whose amplitude can be detectable by future space interferometers and pulsar timing arrays such as decigo , elisa and ska @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[setup ] , we present an inflation model with a dilaton and an axion , both of which are coupled with a su(2 ) gauge field .",
    "we then derive equations of motions for the homogeneous fields and study the background dynamics .",
    "we show two different inflationary stages are realized in sec.[ba ] . in sec.[pe ] , first we decompose perturbations into scalar , vector , and tensor perturbations and give the gauge conditions .",
    "next , we analyze tensor dynamics and show that chiral gravitational waves are produced on scales smaller than cmb scales . in sec.[sca ] , we also discuss the dynamics of scalar perturbations .",
    "we estimate the amplitude of curvature perturbations on cmb scales and check the stability of scalar dynamics on small scales . in sec.[phe ] , we discuss phenomenological predictions in this model .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion . in the appendix",
    "a , we list equations used in the numerical calculations .",
    "in this section , we present an inflationary model and derive equations of background motions . specifically , we consider a dilaton field  @xmath4  and an axion field  @xmath5 , both of which are coupled with a su(2 ) gauge field  @xmath6 .",

    "we analyze the background dynamics which eventually produces chiral gravitational waves on small scales .",
    "first , we discuss initial conditions .",
    "we assume that the dilaton is energetically dominant and plays a role of an inflaton in the early stage of inflation .",
    "the dynamics during inflation can be described by slow - roll equations @xmath52 in addition to those , we assume that the axion also satisfies a slow - roll equation @xmath53 now , we introduce the slow - roll parameters in this system @xmath54 where we defined slow - roll parameters @xmath55 here , we assume the relation  @xmath56 which can be realized easily",

    "inspired by this result , we put the gauge kinetic function as @xmath58 \\label{eq : i } \\ , \\ ] ] where  @xmath59  is a constant .",
    "thus , we have an approximate relation  @xmath60 during slow - roll inflation .",
    "note that  @xmath61  is a parameter and it controls the strength of the gauge coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a gauge field with a weak coupling constant .",
    "namely ,  @xmath62  is a decreasing function ( @xmath63 )  and we choose its initial value  @xmath59  very large in order to get  @xmath64  at the end of inflation .",
    "this assumption is necessary to avoid the strong coupling problem .",
    "hence the electric and magnetic components must be very small in order to satisfy slow - roll equations .",
    "the naturalness of this requirement depends on the effective potential of the gauge field , as we discuss later . due to this assumption",
    ", we can neglect their non - linear effects at first . then , eq .",
    "can be reduced to @xmath65 which can be integrated as @xmath66 thus , the energy density of electric field evolves as @xmath67 since we are interested in the solution where the energy density of the gauge field does not decay , we consider  @xmath68  region . on the other hand ,",
    "the growing mode of magnetic energy density is proportional to  @xmath69  so that  @xmath70  grows more rapidly than  @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , we can separate the inflationary history of this model into two stages . in the early stage of inflation ,",
    "@xmath70  is negligibly small compared to @xmath71 so its effect on the dynamics can be ignored in the background motion .",
    "we assume that primordial fluctuations on cmb scales are generated during this stage . in the late stage of inflation",
    ", however ,  @xmath70  grows sufficiently first and catches up with  @xmath71 .",
    "as we explicitly show later , during this stage , the interaction between the gauge field and the axion become important and an inflationary dynamics goes into an attractor solution , which is quite similar to the dynamics of chromo - natural inflation @xcite . from now on , we explain these two inflationary stages separately .      in an initial period , the energy density of the gauge field is so small that only a dilaton contributes an inflationary dynamics .",
    "however , when  @xmath71  grows sufficiently , the slow - roll condition for  @xmath4  will be no more valid and modified as @xmath72 substituting into , we can solve this equation  @xcite and find the gauge kinetic function as @xmath73 where   @xmath74 is a constant of integration and @xmath75  is the slow - roll parameter in terms of the potential . here , we note the relation @xmath76 we neglected the time dependence of @xmath77 in the above .",
    "we can see that the second term in becomes soon negligible when @xmath78 .",
    "thus ,  @xmath71  settles in a nearly constant value during this period @xmath79 that implies the effective @xmath61 goes to @xmath80  @xcite . at this time",
    "the relation between  @xmath81  and  @xmath82  reads @xmath83 remarkably , an electric component of gauge field finally supports the slow - roll inflation in this period .",
    "then hubble slow - roll parameters read @xmath84      up to here , we have neglected the non - linear effect of the gauge field .",
    "however , the energy density of magnetic field  @xmath70  grows and eventually becomes greater than  @xmath71 for @xmath68 .",
    "as the non - linear effect becomes important , we can not use eq .. instead , we have to consider the full equation of motion for the gauge field . here , we rewrite eq . into the equation for  @xmath85  defined by @xmath86 which looks like an equation for a scalar field .",
    "hence we can interpret the right hand side of eq . as an effective potential force of the gauge field .",
    "it is easy to read off the effective potential from eq . as @xmath87 note that we neglected the slow - roll corrections .",
    "we can understand a background dynamics of the gauge field from this effective potential .",
    "let us focus on the coefficient of  @xmath88  term .",
    "before inflation occurs , we assume that its coefficient was positive and  @xmath85  is near an origin of its potential .",
    "however , we assume that at a certain time  @xmath89  is realized and  @xmath85  starts to roll down on the potential .",
    "even if  @xmath71  modifies slow - roll dynamics ,  @xmath90  holds due to .",
    "therefore , in an early period  @xmath85  grows up because of the negativity of  @xmath88  term .",
    "however ,  @xmath85  stops its growth when non - linear magnetic  @xmath91  term becomes important .",
    "moreover , due to axion - gauge interaction  @xmath92  term , this effective potential gets two different minimum values , so we expect that there is a trajectory where the gauge field finally settles in a deeper bottom of this potential . at this time ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath85 obey slow - roll equations @xmath93 diagonalizing this system , we have @xmath94 where we defined two model parameters @xmath95 if  @xmath96  and  @xmath97  hold , we get the following results @xmath98 remarkably , the background gauge field settles in a minimum value of its effective potential .",
    "this is essentially an attractor solution in chromo - natural inflation @xcite . in our model , however , the condition  @xmath99  and the slow - roll equation can be controlled by the gauge kinetic function .",
    "so we can realize this slow - roll trajectory for a broad parameter region compared to the original chromo - natural inflation .",
    "interestingly , this inflationary dynamics generates parity - violating chiral gravitational waves .",
    "we discuss the detail of this mechanism later .",
    "finally , let us check the evolution of the gauge kinetic function during this period . in this period ,",
    "the energy densities of the electric and the magnetic fields are given by @xmath100 hence if  @xmath101  holds , the slow - roll equation for @xmath4 reads @xmath102 substituting into the above equation , we obtaine the time evolution of  @xmath62 as @xmath103^{-1/2 } \\ , \\label{eq : ib}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is a constant of integration . note that we neglected the terms which are suppressed in the slow - roll approximation .",
    "the first term in the parenthesis is almost constant .",
    "moreover , when the energy density of the axion becomes dominant in the late stage of inflation @xmath105 , the second term in the parenthesis is also almost constant .",
    "hence , @xmath106 decreases very slowly .      as a numerical example , let us show this background dynamics by using the following potentials @xmath107 \\ , \\\\",

    ", @xmath19 is the decay constant and @xmath0 is a parameter .",
    "it is well known that single - field power - law inflation is in conflict with cmb observations . however , in this model the background gauge field modifies the slow - roll dynamics and consequently the tensor - to - scalar ratio is suppressed .",
    "hence , there is a room the model becomes viable as we will discuss later .    in fig.[fig :",
    "gauge ] , we plotted the time evolution of the energy density of the gauge field in terms of  @xmath110  and  @xmath111 , and the time evolution of the gauge field  @xmath40 .",
    "as you can see ,  @xmath70  catches up with  @xmath71 after @xmath112 e - folds and the transition of the dynamics of the gauge field happens due to the non - linear effect .",
    "we can also see that  @xmath40  stops its growth and oscillates when the magnetic energy density grows sufficiently , and finally settles in a constant value .",
    "note that we used a super - planckian decay constant  @xmath113 in the plot by assuming it can be effectively produced by the combination of sub - planckian decay constants derived from aligned multiple axions @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that , in the late stage of inflation , one of circular polarization states of gauge field fluctuations are enhanced due to the tachyonic instability and the rapid growth of the gauge field produces sizable circularly polarized gravitational waves .",
    "in this section , we consider a perturbed universe . to analyze the dynamics , we need to define perturbed quantities .",
    "first , for the metric we use the following variables @xmath114 where the spatial metric is further decomposed as @xmath115 note that  @xmath116  and  @xmath117  are transverse vectors and  @xmath118  is a transverse traceless tensor .",

    "we found that they are characterized by the kinetic energy density of the gauge field and can be controlled so that the model becomes consistent with the constraints from the current cmb observations .",
    "in particular , since the - gauge field is inert in the early stage of inflation , the model does not show any conflict with the cmb constraints .",
    "the main prediction of this paper is the generation of chiral gravitational waves on small scales .",
    "we found an inflationary solution where the gauge field grows due to the gauge - kinetic function and finally settles in a finite value  @xmath333 , which realizes the delayed chromo - natural inflation .",
    "then we analyzed tensor dynamics in the late stage of inflation and computed gravitational wave spectrum by employing the in - in formalism , and got the qualitatively similar result as chromo - natural inflation @xcite .",
    "the general feature of tensor perturbations is the enhancement of chiral gravitational waves which is controlled by an attractor value  @xmath333  and the mass parameter of the gauge field  @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , we checked the stability condition of scalar dynamics and showed that there is a stable parameter region  @xmath294 . note that during this period we have chosen the gauge - kinetic function so that the interaction of the dilaton to the gauge field does not contribute to perturbation dynamics .",
    "we found that there is a parameter region where chiral gravitational waves are produced in an interesting frequency range , higher than nhz , which might be detectable in future gravitational wave interferometers and pulsar timing arrays , such as decigo , elisa and ska .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the reheating stage in this model .",
    "we expect from our previous work @xcite that at this epoch the effective mass parameter  @xmath191  grows and then chiral gravitational waves are more enhanced , which might reach the current observational bounds on ground - based interferometers . in this paper",
    ", we studied our model with an isotropic initial condition .",
    "notice that the anisotropy remains in models with a gauge kinetic function for a non - abelian gauge field @xcite .",
    "while , in the case of chromo - natural inflation , the initial anisotropy decays and the isotropic configuration is stable @xcite .",
    "thus , it is intriguing to investigate the fate of the initial anisotropy in our model .",
