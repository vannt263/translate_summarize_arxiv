    "effective chiral quark models have been used extensively to describe the low - energy phenomena associated with the dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "of particular interest are models which include the dirac sea of quarks , since they allow for a common description of mesons and baryons .",
    "the models share the feature of having an attractive four - quark interaction which is either :    * postulated @xcite ; * derived from a model of the underlying qcd structure of the vacuum @xcite ; * obtained by modeling the effective gluon propagator and using schwinger - dyson techniques @xcite ; * derived from qcd inspired models @xcite .    for extensive reviews with a focus on solitons , and numerous additional references ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the four - quark interaction leads to the chiral symmetry breaking , which is , in the framework of these models , the key dynamical ingredient .",
    "the various models fall into two categories : _ local _ models , where the four - quark interaction is point - like and where ultra - violet divergences are removed by introducing cut - offs in the quark loop , and _ nonlocal _ models , where the four - quark interaction is smeared , such that all feynman diagrams in the theory are finite .",
    "nonlocal models arise naturally in several approaches to low - energy quark dynamics , such as the instanton - liquid model @xcite or schwinger - dyson resummations @xcite . for the derivations and farther applications of nonlocal quark models see , _",
    "e.g. _ , .",
    "considerable effort has been exerted to describe baryons as solitons of effective chiral quark models .",
    "the solitons appear as bound states of quarks . except for our earlier - reported work @xcite",
    ", solitons have so far only been obtained from local models , which typically use the schwinger proper - time or the pauli - villars regularization of the dirac sea @xcite .",
    "one problem encountered with the proper - time regularization , by far the most commonly used , is that the solitons turn out to be unstable unless the auxiliary sigma and pion fields , introduced in the process of semi - bosonization , are constrained to lie on the chiral circle @xcite .",
    "such a constraint is external to the model itself .",
    "nonlocal models do not suffer from this instability : we have shown @xcite that stable solitons exist in a chiral quark model with nonlocal interactions without the extra chiral - circle constraint .",
    "in fact , we find appreciable deviations from the chiral circle .",
    "furthermore , in local models , the regularization is applied only to the real ( non - anomalous ) part of the euclidean quark - loop term .",
    "the finite imaginary ( anomalous ) part is left unregularized in order to properly describe anomalous processes @xcite .",
    "one may view such a division as rather artificial , and we find it quite appealing that , with nonlocal regulators , both the real and imaginary parts of the action are treated on equal footing .",
    "moreover , the _ anomalies are preserved _ @xcite and the _ charges are properly quantized _ @xcite .",
    "finally , the momentum - dependent regulator makes the theory _ finite to all orders _ in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "this is in contrast to local models , where inclusion of higher - order - loop effects requires extra regulators @xcite and the predictive power is diminished .",
    "the above - mentioned virtues of nonlocal models do not come for free .",
    "two complications arise .",
    "first , soliton calculations require an extra integration over an energy variable , which has to be performed numerically .",
    "second , the noether currents in nonlocal models acquire extra contributions , which are , however , needed to conserve the noether currents and anomalies .",
    "nevertheless , an ambiguity remains : the transverse parts of currents are not fixed by current conservation and their choice is effectively part of the model building .",
    "this problem has been known for a long time in nuclear physics , where the transverse part of the meson - exchange currents is ambiguous @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to get rid of this ambiguity in gauging nonlocal models .",
    "an ideal solution would be to first gauge the underlying theory ( _ e.g. _ the instanton model of the qcd vacuum ) , and then to derive an effective gauged quark model .",
    "this has not been attempted so far , so that in effective nonlocal quark models we need to deal with transverse currents which are not uniquely defined . fixing these currents",
    "is a part of the model building .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the existence of solitons and we give the description of formal and technical aspects of constructing solitons in nonlocal chiral quark models .",
    "we do not aim for an accurate phenomenology of the nucleon and the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "it is known from the experience gained in local models that , in addition to the mean - field approximation applied in our work , many other effects can and should be included : the projection of the center - of - mass motion and angular - momentum , @xcite , the rotational @xmath3 corrections @xcite , inclusion of other degrees of freedom such as vector mesons @xcite or color - dielectric fields @xcite .",
    "these may considerably alter and improve the results .",
    "we stress that the methods which we describe in this paper are applicable to all models with _",
    "separable nonlocal four - fermion interactions _ provided that it is possible to perform an analytic continuation in the four - momentum close to zero , as explained in sect .",

    "[ sec : noether ] , we apply the technique of path - ordered @xmath0-exponents and we obtain general expressions for currents in the soliton background .",
    "interesting results follow : the properties of the soliton , which are related to currents at zero momenta ( charges , @xmath4 , and in general @xmath5-point green functions with vanishing momenta on external legs ) do not depend on the choice of the path in the @xmath0-exponent , and are thus universal . on the other hand , observables which probe the soliton at non - zero momenta ( form - factors , magnetic moments )",
    "do depend on the gauging prescription .",
    "however , in the cases we have explored , the contributions of the nonlocal parts of currents are small , in particular for sufficiently large solitons . in sect .",
    "[ sec : observables ] we apply two prescriptions to compute observables : straight - line paths in the @xmath0-exponents and the weak - nonlocality limit , where the energy scale of the regulator is assumed to be parametrically much larger than the other scales in the problem .",

    "@xcite ) or a monopole @xcite form for the regulator : @xmath20    the action ( [ actalarip ] ) is easily cast into the form @xmath21 the regulators appearing in the four - quark interaction have a separable form in momentum space .",
    "the separability of the quark interaction is also present in the instanton - liquid model @xcite .",
    "soliton calculations are more easily performed by using the _ equivalent _ bosonized form of the action ( [ actalarip ] ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the local chiral field which is the _ dynamical variable _ of the system .",

    "( [ action ] ) is over color , flavor , dirac indices , and space - time .",
    "the chiral fields represent the following expectation values of bilinear forms of the quark fields : @xmath24    since stationary solitons involve time - independent @xmath25 and @xmath0 fields , it is more useful to express the action in terms of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath26 bearing in mind , however , that the regulator makes the dirac hamiltonian dependent ( although diagonal ) on the energy variable . the action ( [ action ] ) becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the euclidean time variable .",
    "our use of the model action ( [ actionham ] ) is the same as in other hedgehog soliton calculations : we treat the @xmath25 and @xmath0 fields classically , thus keeping the leading - order contribution in the number of colors , @xmath29 . interestingly , in nonlocal models the next - to - leading - order corrections are found to be surprisingly small in the vacuum sector @xcite .    we seek a stationary point of the action , or , more precisely , a minimum of the energy for time - independent chiral fields with a hedgehog shape @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",

    "the regulator acts as a differential operator , @xmath38 .",
    "it introduces a nonlocal interaction between the quarks and the chiral fields . for time - independent chiral fields @xmath39 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ chiphi ] ) , the dirac operator is diagonal in the energy representation , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy - dependent dirac hamiltonian : @xmath42 the kahana - ripka basis @xcite is convenient to diagonalize the dirac hamiltonian @xmath43 , since the regulator @xmath17 is diagonal in this basis . indeed , using the notation @xmath44 for the kahana - ripka basis states , we have @xmath45 . in this notation , @xmath46 is the radial momentum of a quark quantized in a spherical box , @xmath47 is the orbital momentum of the upper component , @xmath48 is the total angular momentum of the quark , and @xmath14 is the grand spin , obtained by adding @xmath48 and the isospin @xmath49 .",
    "we diagonalize the dirac hamiltonian ( [ hamomeg ] ) for each value of @xmath50 , thereby obtaining the energy - dependent quark orbits : @xmath51 observables can then be calculated in terms of the quark orbits @xmath52 .",
    "a technical complication , compared to earlier calculations which used local models , is the presence of an additional integral over @xmath53 in the expressions for observables , which has to be carried numerically .",
    "we can use the basis @xmath54 to express the action ( [ actionham ] ) in the form : @xmath55 the sum over @xmath56 includes color . in the zero - temperature limit and for time - independent fields @xmath25 and @xmath0 the energy of the system is equal to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vacuum subtraction , obtained by setting @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this subtraction ensures ( together with the regulator ) that the energy remains finite .",
    "we integrate the first term by parts .",
    "the boundary term cancels out when the vacuum energy is subtracted , and we find @xmath61    the determination of the baryon number of the soliton is not obvious because the regulators appearing in the action ( [ actalarip ] ) prevent us from performing a canonical quantization of the quark field . in spite of this , the baryon number turns out to be correctly quantized . a simple way to see this consists in constructing the noether current associated to the abelian gauge transformation @xmath62 of the quark fields @xcite . for the sake of calculating the baryon number",

    "therefore @xmath71 and the baryon number is @xmath72 where the factor @xmath1 is due to the fact that the quark carries baryon number @xmath1 . using the spectral basis @xmath73 to evaluate the trace , we obtain the following expression for the baryon number of the system : @xmath74 the presence of the factors @xmath75 is crucial for the quantization of the baryon number .",
    "they appear in the calculation of all observables related to noether currents , such as the baryon density , @xmath76 , and magnetic moments , as shown in app .",
    "[ app : observables ] .",
    "the factors @xmath75 are the _ inverse residues _ of the poles of the quark propagator @xmath77 . indeed , in the vicinity of a pole at @xmath78 we find @xmath79 the position of these poles corresponds to the `` on - shell '' single - quark energies .",
    "if we were able to deform the integration contour of the energy variable @xmath53 such as to close it at infinity above or below the real axis , the energy would become the sum of the on - shell quark energies , and each pole would contribute a factor of @xmath80 to the baryon number ( strictly , a factor @xmath1 , but we construct colorless solitons by placing @xmath29 quarks into each orbit ) .",
    "the baryon number is thus effectively _ quantized _ despite the fact that we can not perform a canonical quantization of the quark fields .",
    "we now construct the valence orbit in the nonlocal model . in our calculations",
    "the spectrum of the dirac orbits @xmath81 in the hedgehog field displays a similar pattern for all values of the euclidean energy variable @xmath53 .",
    "it consists of a dirac sea , which is the set of negative energy orbits and a set of positive energy orbits , which are separated from the dirac sea orbits by a well defined energy gap . within this gap",
    ", there appears a bound positive energy @xmath82 @xmath83 orbit , which we call the _ valence orbit _ and which is well separated from both the positive energy and negative energy dirac sea orbits .",

    "when the integration path of @xmath50 is deformed so as to include the valence orbit , as shown in fig .  1 , the soliton acquires baryon number @xmath91 , and its energy is equal to @xmath92 the first term is the valence orbit contribution , the second term , _ with the integration carried along the real axis _ in the @xmath53 complex plane , is the dirac - sea contribution .",
    "the third term is the energy of the meson fields .",
    "= 6.5 cm    [ contour ]    in addition to the valence pole , located on the imaginary euclidean energy axis in the vicinity of 0 , there are many other poles in the complex - energy plane .",

    "e.g. _ those with the proper - time regularization @xcite . fortunately ,",
    "for the chosen regulators ( [ regulator ] ) the other poles lie far away from the origin on the scale @xmath93 , hence they do not interfere with the valence orbit , and the deformation of the @xmath53-integration contour is well - defined .    the pole defined by eq .",
    "( [ valonshell ] ) occurs at an imaginary @xmath50 and therefore at a negative @xmath94 .",
    "the determination of the valence orbit requires therefore an analytic continuation of the regulator to negative arguments because @xmath95 can become negative for low - enough @xmath96 .",

    "this leaves one undetermined parameter , which we choose to be @xmath34 , the vacuum value of the scalar field @xmath113 . admittedly , it is somewhat abusive to claim that the model depends only on three parameters .",
    "it is only true to the extent that the regulator @xmath114 is expressed in terms of one parameter , such as the cut - off appearing in ( [ regulator ] ) .",
    "the model depends in fact on the _ shape _ of the regulator and furthermore , as we have seen in sect .",
