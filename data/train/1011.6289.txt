    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute atomic gases  @xcite has lead to a resurgence of interest in the theory of weakly interacting bose gases  @xcite .",
    "theories of weakly - interacting bec were initially developed  @xcite in the hope of obtaining insight into the physics of the strongly interacting superfluid helium , and can only give a qualitative account of the physics of the liquid superfluid phase  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the advent of dilute , weakly interacting bose gases in the laboratory provides for the direct comparison of theories of weakly interacting bec with experiments ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . more generally , these systems offer an unprecedented opportunity for the quantitative experimental evaluation of quantum - field models at finite temperatures , and away from equilibrium , as noted by other authors  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the weakly interacting bose gas at finite temperature is significantly complicated by the necessity of considering interactions between excitations of the condensate . a self - consistent mean - field approach , based on approximate factorizations of field - operator products  @xcite leads to the so - called hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism for the finite - temperature field , which is also obtained in a variational approach to the problem  @xcite .",
    "this description , however , violates known exact constraints on the excitation spectrum  @xcite , due to the inconsistent introduction of ( leading - order ) many - body effects  @xcite into the description of atomic interactions .",
    "the simplest resolution of this problem is provided by the so - called popov approximation  @xcite to the hfb theory ( hfb - popov ) , in which interactions between excitations at the hartree - fock level are retained  @xcite , while many - body corrections are neglected in the treatment of all interatomic interactions .    a systematic perturbative treatment of the beyond - quadratic terms of the bose - field hamiltonian  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) demonstrates that the failure of the hfb method results from an inconsistent treatment of hamiltonian terms cubic in the bose field operator in the mean - field factorization approximation .",
    "this provides support for an extension of the conventional hfb approach  @xcite in which the popov theory is augmented by spatially dependent _ effective _ interaction strengths , which serve to upgrade the hartree - fock interactions between atoms to interactions mediated by a many - body @xmath1  matrix , which accounts for all ladder - diagram processes contributing to interactions in the finite - temperature medium  @xcite .",
    "however , in this theory the zero - energy limit of the @xmath1  matrix is substituted for the interaction strength in all condensate - excitation interactions , neglecting the dependence of the @xmath1  matrix on the collision energies .",
    "more complicated ( bubble - diagram  @xcite ) effects which appear at the same order of perturbation theory  @xcite as the ladder - diagram corrections are also neglected . kinetic theories which include processes beyond those contained in the hfb theories , such as the exchange of atoms between the condensate and thermal cloud , have been considered by several authors  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to modeling the finite - temperature bose gas is provided by the so - called classical - field ( or c - field ) formalism  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one considers the dynamics of a classical dynamical system corresponding to the high mode - occupation limit of the formal second - quantized field theory  @xcite for the dilute bose gas .",
    "the classical - field model provides a leading - order description of the long - wavelength physics which dominate the critical behavior associated with the bose - condensation phase transition  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the _ dynamical _ classical - field equations of motion arise as the `` classical '' component of the atomic - field evolution in the wigner representation of the second - quantized field  @xcite .",
    "the classical - field model is thus expected to give a good description of the most highly occupied modes of the system , including the condensate and its low - lying excitations , for which quantum fluctuations can be safely neglected .",
    "the introduction of an explicit single - particle energy cutoff restricts the system to these low - energy modes  @xcite . in closely related stochastic - field methods",
    "@xcite , the description of the low - energy modes includes explicit damping and noise terms arising from the coupling of these modes to the eliminated high - energy component of the bose field .",
    "the classical wave - mixing dynamics of the resulting ( hamiltonian or stochastic ) field equation of motion then provide an intrinsic nonperturbative description of all interaction processes in the low - energy field , neglecting only the quantal nature of excitations , which is essentially irrelevant in the high - temperature regime . the inclusion of many - body effects beyond bogoliubov theory in the hamiltonian classical - field theory , and agreement of this theory with the second - order perturbative treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite was demonstrated for a homogeneous field in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present a comprehensive , explicit demonstration that the equilibrium classical - field dynamics provide an intrinsic description of many - body interactions in the finite - temperature , harmonically confined bose field . introducing appropriate @xmath0-symmetric field variables , analogous to the modified ladder operators of number - conserving bogoliubov theories  @xcite , we quantify the anomalous and non - gaussian nature of the field fluctuations .",
    "these correlations reveal signatures of many - body processes neglected in ( e.g. ) the hfb theories .",
    "we discuss the importance of these processes in shaping the condensate orbital , and demonstrate the consistency of the penrose - onsager definition of condensation in the classical - field equilibrium .",
    "in particular , we show that the penrose - onsager condensate appears as an effective eigenfunction of the total mean - field potential it experiences , provided that the contributions of anomalous averages ( both pair and triplet ) to the latter are taken into account .",
    "we also consider the temperature dependence of the many - body effects , and discuss the relation between condensation and the overall suppression of density fluctuations in the system .",
    "our results reveal that the partially condensed bose gas exhibits non - trivial correlations as a result of purely thermal ( classical ) fluctuations of the atomic field , which dominate over the quantum fluctuations of the field in realistic experimental systems  @xcite .",

    "we observe that the contribution of @xmath227 ( triangles ) is the dominant beyond - condensate contribution to @xmath206 at the lowest energies , but reaches its maximum magnitude at @xmath228 , and is overtaken by the contribution of @xmath224 ( pluses ) at higher energies .",
    "this contribution is itself overtaken soon after by the contribution of the fourth cumulant @xmath161 ( crosses ) , which is of course the dominant contribution in the critical regime .",
    "the results presented here should be compared with the behavior of the homogeneous bose gas in two dimensions , for which it is found that the quasicondensate density is in general greater than the superfluid density , and that the quasicondensate correlations appear at temperatures well above the critical temperature for the appearance of superfluidity in the system  @xcite .",
    "classical - field calculations for the harmonically trapped quasi - two - dimensional bose gas appear to be consistent with a local - density version of this picture  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that we observe similar behavior in the three - dimensional case considered here : the comparatively large transverse susceptibility of the field  @xcite leads to the ( local ) destruction of order by phase fluctuations before size fluctuations become significant  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a methodology for the calculation of general spatial correlations of the finite - temperature bose gas , including anomalous correlations , in a classical - field approach .",
    "we introduced @xmath0-symmetric classical - field variables , analogous to number - conserving quantum ladder operators considered by other authors  @xcite , in order to rigorously quantify the anomalous correlations in the microcanonical pgpe ensemble .",
    "we have demonstrated that the finite - temperature bose field exhibits non - gaussian correlations which are classical in origin , and by relating these correlations to many - body corrections to the mean - field interaction potentials  @xcite , we have explicitly demonstrated that the classical - field theory provides an intrinsic nonperturbative description of many - body processes in the field .",
    "we discussed the role of these processes in determining the condensate mode , and demonstrated the consistency of the penrose - onsager  @xcite definition of condensation in the classical - field equilibrium .",
    "finally , we elucidated the contribution of the anomalous and non - gaussian correlations of the noncondensate to the overall suppression of density fluctuations in the field , and discussed the distinction between the quasicondensate defined by the suppression of density fluctuations , and the true condensate defined by the suppression of phase fluctuations .",
    "our demonstration of the intrinsic description of many - body interaction effects provided by the classical - field method underlines the utility of these techniques in describing low - dimensional systems  @xcite , in which such effects can have profound consequences for the structure of the field equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "indeed our results illustrate the complexities introduced by the independence of phase and density fluctuations @xcite in the inhomogeneous finite - temperature bose gas even in the comparatively straightforward three - dimensional case .",
    "moreover , although we have only considered systems at equilibrium , our results demonstrate that the classical - field model of the low - energy coherent region does describe the higher - order processes associated with quasiparticle damping , and the exchange of atoms between the condensate and its excitations , which are essential for the description of nonequilibrium dynamics of the finite - temperature bose field  @xcite .    while making revisions to this article , the authors were saddened to learn of the passing of professor allan griffin , and would like to acknowledge discussions and correspondence with him that have helped to shape the ideas presented here .",
