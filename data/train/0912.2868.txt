    "quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum information sciences @xcite .",
    "as the quantum states interact with their environment therefore it is very important to understand how an initial entanglement is affected by this interaction .",
    "the dynamical aspects of entanglement are essential not only for the utilization of entangled states in quantum technology but for a deep understanding of the transition from quantum to classical world as well .",
    "recently , yu - eberly @xcite investigated the dynamics of two - qubit entanglement under various types of decoherence .",
    "they found that although the coherence of a single qubit may take infinite time to vanish , nevertheless entanglement can disappear at a finite time , a phenomenon named as  entanglement sudden death \" ( esd ) .",
    "clearly , such finite - time disentanglement can seriously affect applications of entangled states in quantum information processing .",
    "the initial report of esd in two - qubit entangled states in a specific model was later explored in wider contexts and in higher dimensions of hilbert space where the qubits are replaced by qutrits ( three dimensional systems ) or qudits ( @xmath0 dimensional systems ) @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidences for this effect have been reported for optical setups @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been observed that @xcite if there is entanglement sudden death in the principal system then there is always entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) in the reservoirs .",
    "interestingly , such entanglement sudden birth may appear earlier , simultaneously or later than entanglement sudden death .",
    "entanglement of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit systems has been completely characterized by peres - horodecki criterion @xcite .",
    "this criterion would imply that if a quantum state in hilbert space of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit systems has positive partial transpose ( ppt ) , then it is separable . for higher dimensional bipartite systems such characterization is not an easy task .",
    "bipartite entangled states are divided into free - entangled states and bound - entangled states @xcite .",
    "free - entangled states can be distilled under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) whereas bound - entangled states can not be distilled to pure - state entanglement no matter how many copies are available .",
    "it was observed that bound entanglement may activate teleportation fidelity @xcite and manifests the irreversibility in asymptotic manipulation of entanglement @xcite .",
    "bound entanglement constructed by purely mathematical arguments have existence in physical processes @xcite .",
    "recently , it was proposed that free - entangled states may be converted into bound - entangled states under either multi - local decoherence @xcite and/or under combination of collective and local dephasing processes @xcite . in particular , it was shown that certain free - entangled states of qutrit - qutrit systems become non - distillable in a finite time under the influence of classical noise .",
    "such behavior has been named as distillability sudden death ( dsd ) @xcite .",
    "this discovery raises an interesting question that whether such behavior is restricted to a certain type of environment or it is also a generic feature like entanglement sudden death .",
    "we have studied this phenomenon for certain qutrit - qutrit states which undergo the simple process of spontaneous emission .",
    "we have analyzed the dissipative dynamics of three - level v - type atomic system where spontaneous emission may take place from two excited levels to the ground state and direct transition between excited levels is not allowed .",
    "we have found that distillability sudden death may occur in this type of open systems as well .",
    "this suggests that dsd might be a generic feature such that free - entangled quantum states dynamically convert to bound - entangled states .",
    "however , we have noticed that unlike local and global dephasing processes , simple local unitary transformations can avoid this phenomenon in our specific model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the physical model and the basic equation of motion along with its solution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss briefly the idea of distillability sudden death and demonstrate the possibility of distillability sudden death under amplitude damping . we show that locally equivalent quantum states do not exhibit such behavior .",
    "we discuss the physical reason for distillability sudden death in a particular family of quantum states . we conclude our work in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a three - level atom in the @xmath1 configuration .",
    "let @xmath2 , @xmath3 be the two nondegenerate excited states with transition frequencies to the ground state @xmath4 represented by @xmath5 , @xmath6 and electric dipole moments @xmath7 , @xmath8 respectively .",
    "we assume that excited states can decay to the ground state by spontaneous emission and a direct transition between excited states is not allowed .",
    "the spontaneous decay constants of the excited states @xmath9 , @xmath10 are given as @xmath11 it is well known that if the dipole moments of these two transitions are parallel , then an indirect coupling between levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 can appear due to interaction with vacuum @xcite .",
    "this coupling between transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 is termed as quantum interference with cross damping constant @xmath14 where @xmath15 the parameter @xmath16 represents the mutual orientation of transition dipole moments such that for maximum quantum interference @xmath17 and for @xmath18 it ( interference ) vanishes .",
    "figure [ fig : v - coni ] shows this typical configuration .",
    "the time evolution of this system-@xmath19 is given by the master equation @xcite @xmath20 + \\lambda_\\mathrm{i } \\ , \\rho \\ , , \\label{eq : mesi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the damping term is given as @xmath21 here",
    "@xmath22 is the atomic transition operator taking an atom from level @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "as we are interested in the time evolution of initial states due to the spontaneous emission , we can ignore the hamiltonian part ( for details see @xcite ) .    in atomic spectroscopy ,",
    "the transition dipole moments are usually perpendicular and system-@xmath19 described by eq.([eq : dsi ] ) is difficult to realize .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite that the effects of quantum interference can be simulated to a large degree by three - level system-@xmath25 as shown in figure [ fig : v - con ] with excited states @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the ground state @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding master equation contains the damping operator , @xmath29 the main arguments from ref .",
    "@xcite supporting this idea are sketched as follows .",
    "we consider the system-@xmath19 with @xmath30 . by taking symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the excited states",
