    "electronic scattering due to impurities in metals gives rise to a variety of experimental signatures.@xcite bulk measurements , such as resistivity , are of course affected ; but _ local _ quantities provide much more information about the effect of impurities . in particular , the development of scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) has allowed impurity positions / distributions on the surface to be imaged directly , and real - space maps of the surface local density of states ( ldos ) to be built up.@xcite these maps show pronounced inhomogeneities and even quantum interference due to the presence of impurities.@xcite    more recently , ft - sts  the fourier transform of ldos maps obtained through sts  has been connected to quasiparticle interference ( qpi).@xcite it describes how the bloch state quasiparticles of a clean host system are scattered from impurities .",

    "[ fig : qpi_clust ] we plot the corresponding difference in the qpi , as calculated using the independent cluster and independent impurity approximations .",
    "the change in the qpi is dominated by intra - cluster contributions for an @xmath12 pair with separation vector @xmath187 , as seen directly from the modulation of qpi intensity in the figure ( the impurities in the other @xmath12 cluster are separated by @xmath188 ; intra - cluster interactions are weak in this case , and so its contribution to the overall qpi is small ) .",
    "our results indicate that the independent impurity picture , strictly applicable only in the dilute limit , works surprisingly well when the cluster incidence is low .",
    "then the physics of independent quantum impurities dominates the qpi  even for relatively large impurity densities up to @xmath150 when sampling a surface region of size @xmath173 , with @xmath189 . to capture inter - impurity interactions , which become important for local quantities near clusters and for fine details in the qpi",

    "we have studied systems of multiple magnetic impurities deposited on the surface of a 3d metallic host , and the associated scattering signatures in qpi . from solution of the real - space two - impurity model , we are able to define and identify a ` dilute impurity limit ' for many - impurity systems , in which each impurity in practice behaves independently of the others . for realistic parameters , the length scale @xmath139 for the onset of the dilute limit",
    "is found to be strikingly low  the inter - impurity separation need only be a few lattice sites .",
    "overall , the physics is overwhelmingly dominated by independent single - impurity effects for impurity coverages up to @xmath156 when the kondo temperature is small , @xmath190 ; while for @xmath191 , a surface coverage up to @xmath192 is found to remain ` dilute ' .",
    "measurable qpi therefore reflects the pristine single - impurity result,@xcite modulated only by a trivial structure factor due to the real - space impurity distribution .",
    "as such , the temperature and scanning - energy dependence of the qpi are entirely characteristic of the underlying single - impurity kondo effect .    going beyond the dilute limit to higher impurity coverage , inter - impurity interactions within impurity clusters",
    "must naturally be taken into account .",
    "the clusters themselves can nevertheless be well - separated , and therefore behave independently .",
    "an ` independent cluster ' approximation , applying in a ` dilute cluster limit ' then yields accurate results for the physics of such many - impurity systems .",
    "an independent cluster picture must of course ultimately fail when impurity coverage is increased towards and above a percolation threshold where the entire system becomes ` connected ' .",
    "the physics then involves a subtle interplay between kondo , rkky , disorder , and the collective heavy fermion physics of the diluted periodic anderson lattice  and remains a perenially open problem .",
