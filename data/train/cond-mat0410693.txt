    "quantum dimer models ( qdm)@xcite provide simple examples@xcite of microscopic hamiltonians with short - ranged resonating valence - bond ground - states ( or dimer liquid ) with gapped excitations and no broken symmetry ( @xmath0 liquids ) .",
    "it has been known for a long time that such liquids are characterized by topological order:@xcite although the system breaks no symmetry and has no local order parameter , the ground - state acquires a degeneracy ( in the thermodynamic limit ) which depends on the genus of the surface where the model is defined ( disk , cylinder , torus , etc . ) .",
    "remarkably , such a topological degeneracy is insensitive to small local perturbations ( such as weak disorder for instance).@xcite on the other hand , it is clear that strong enough local perturbations should lift this degeneracy .",
    "consider for instance a @xmath0 dimer liquid on a cylinder , with a two - fold degenerate ground - state .",
    "we turn on an external potential which penalizes ( with an energy @xmath1 ) any dimer sitting across a line extending from one edge of the cylinder to the other . for very large @xmath2 ,",
    "one effectively `` cuts '' the cylinder down to a disk topology and one expects a single non - degenerate ground - state .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect a phase transition at some intermediate value @xmath2 .",
    "we provide here a simple model where the spectrum , and the ground - state degeneracy in particular , can be _ exactly _ calculated as a function of @xmath2 and the system size .",
    "this model generalizes a qdm on the kagome lattice ( network of corner - sharing triangles with triangular and hexagonal plaquettes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : arrow ] ) ) which was introduced recently.@xcite the full spectrum ( and wave - functions ) can be obtained in an elementary way and excitations consist of static and non - interacting ising vortices@xcite ( visons@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we show how the solution of the model extends to a situation where an external potential is applied along a line of the system .",
    "the solution is obtained by noting that the bulk of the system decouples from the line and the line is exactly described by an ising chain in transverse field ( ictf ) . as a result",
    ", we find a finite _ critical _ value @xmath3 of the perturbation below which the system behaves as a cylinder ( the energy difference between the two quasi - degenerate ground - states is exponentially small in the system size ) .",
    "for @xmath4 the system behaves as a disk and the ground - state is separated from the first excited state by a finite gap @xmath5 .",
    "it has been argued that gapped systems with a topological degeneracy could provide physical ways to implement quantum - bits ( qubits ) which would be protected from decoherence by their topological nature.@xcite since no _ local _ measurement can distinguish the different ground - states if the system is infinitely large , any manipulation ( unitary rotation ) or measurement ( projection ) of the state of the qubit through local observables will have to rely on finite - size effects .",
    "we discuss this issue in section  [ sec : qubit ] in the light of the present solvable model .",
    "the effective hamiltonian acting on the two lowest levels is expressed in terms of two generators @xmath6 and @xmath7 of rotations of the qubit about two quantization axis .",
    "we finally explain how one could take advantage of the phase transition at @xmath8 to perform unitary rotations . the problems of this approach , such as thermal excitations ,",
    "will also be discussed briefly .",
    "we consider a qdm defined on a kagome lattice with periodic boundary conditions in one direction ( cylinder ) but the arguments are easily generalized to other topologies .      because it is the natural formalism to describe and solve the qdm discussed here , we begin by reminding the representation of dimer coverings of the kagome lattice in terms of _ arrows_.@xcite    the sites of a kagome lattice @xmath9 ( noted @xmath10 ) can be identified with bonds of the hexagonal lattice @xmath11",
    ". can be any trivalent lattice ( each site has three neighbors ) with any topology : disk , sphere , cylinder , torus etc ... as an example , @xmath11 can be an hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions in one direction ( cylinder ) .",
    "then one constructs a new lattice @xmath9 by the medial lattice construction : sites of @xmath9 are the middle points of the bonds of @xmath11.@xcite in the following , for simplicity , we will choose @xmath11 to be an hexagonal lattice and @xmath9 as a kagome lattice ( hence the names @xmath11 and @xmath9 ) . ]",
    "the triangles of @xmath9 ( noted @xmath12 ) are sites of @xmath11 . as for hexagons of @xmath9 (",
    "noted @xmath13 ) , they also correspond to hexagons of @xmath11 .",
    "from a ( fully - packed ) dimer covering of @xmath9 we orientate the bonds of @xmath11 ( arrows ) in the following way : each bond of @xmath11 is a site of @xmath9 which has one dimer , the corresponding arrow points toward the interior of the triangle ( of @xmath9 ) where the other end of the dimer is .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrow ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of incoming arrow(s ) is even ( 0 or 2 ) at each vertex of @xmath11 .",
    "inversely , any arrow configuration satisfying the parity constraint at each vertex defines a unique dimer covering .",
    "we can now define the operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 acting on the arrows .",
    "the notations are those of refs .   and :    * @xmath17 : flips the arrow at site @xmath18 .",

    "is the sum of all possible `` kinetic energy '' terms ( ring exchange ) which can be defined inside the star surrounding @xmath13 .",
    "those terms allow from 3 to 6 dimers to move . ] from the definition of @xmath15 above , the @xmath16 operators satisfy @xmath22 and commute with each other .",
    "* @xmath23 : compares the arrow at site @xmath10 with the the arrow in some ( arbitrary ) reference covering ( @xmath24 if they are the same , @xmath25 otherwise ) . the hard - core constraint on dimers translates into @xmath26 for every triangle @xmath27 of the kagome lattice .    from now on and for",
    "most purposes one can forget the dimers themselves and focus only on the bond degrees of freedom @xmath28 .",
    "gauge degrees of freedom@xcite while the local constraint is the gauss law of the gauge description.@xcite as for @xmath29 , it is the gauge flux going through the hexagon @xmath13 . ]",
    "we note that , in principle , the @xmath28 degrees of freedom could be physically realized with real spins living on a kagome lattice . a strong easy - axis anisotropy could then force them to point toward the center of one of the neighboring triangle .",
    "the qdm introduced in ref .   is @xmath30 all the eigenstates are easily obtained because the @xmath31 operators commute with each other and have two eigenvalues @xmath32 .. this comes from the fact that , in such a geometry , @xmath33 flips every arrow _ twice _ and thus reduces to the identity . ]      as usual for dimer models , the configurations are grouped in topological sectors ( ts ) : two configurations are in the same ts if and only if they can be transformed into each other by a succession of _ local _ moves .",
    "as explained below , there are two ts when the system has the topology of a cylinder .",
    "first draw a cut @xmath34 ( crossing the bonds of the lattice ) going from one edge of the cylinder to the other ( fig .",

    "this demonstrates the two - fold ( topological ) degeneracy of the eigenstates of @xmath43 .",
    "we introduce a potential energy term which couples to the dimers crossing @xmath34 : @xmath49 as discussed in the introduction , we expect that a small @xmath2 should not affect the two - fold degeneracy while @xmath50 should leave a single ground - state . in presence of @xmath51 , @xmath52 is still a conserved quantity but @xmath7 does not commute with @xmath53 and the two sectors are no longer degenerate when @xmath54 .",
    "since for @xmath55 the system minimizes @xmath35 , the ground - state of the @xmath56 sector tends to a state with @xmath57 and that of the @xmath58 sector to a state with @xmath59 . instead of having a superposition of dimer configurations with different values of @xmath35 but a fixed _ parity _ ( _ non - local _ observable ) , the large @xmath2 limit corresponds to a well defined @xmath35 ( sum of _ local _ operators ) .",
