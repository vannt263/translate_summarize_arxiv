    "as the lhc is providing us with unprecedented high - energy data , top - quark physics has reached a mature level in both theory and experiment .",
    "we are able to test properties and interactions of the top - quark with high precision in inclusive cross sections , as well as in specific kinematic regimes through differential distributions . probing",
    "the top - antitop charge asymmetry is a precision test of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it bares information on strong interactions of heavy quarks that can not be directly obtained from cross - section measurements  @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the charge asymmetry is often approached by comparing angular distributions of top- and antitop - quarks , commonly expressed in terms of rapidity differences  ( for an overview of lhc observables , see  @xcite ) .",
    "precise qcd predictions of the rapidity asymmetry at the tevatron have been obtained at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in perturbation theory  @xcite and from soft - gluon resummation  @xcite .    at the lhc ,",
    "the rapidity asymmetry in top - pair production is very small for two reasons : it is induced by partonic quark - antiquark interactions , which are buried under the large ( charge - symmetric ) gluon - gluon background . and it is suppressed in qcd , since it arises only at the perturbative next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have measured the rapidity asymmetry at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies of 7 and 8 tev  @xcite . however",
    ", statistical and systematic uncertainties currently strongly limit the sensitivity to the charge asymmetry through rapidity differences .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity during the 13-tev phase of the lhc will crucially depend on whether it is possible to reduce the systematic uncertainties well below one percent .",
    "can we find an observable of the charge asymmetry that is larger in magnitude and thus better suited for a precise measurement ? if the top - antitop pair is produced in association with a hard jet , the rapidity asymmetry appears already at the leading order ( lo ) in qcd , and it is indeed large and negative .",
    "but nlo corrections are sizeable and positive and reduce the asymmetry to a quantity no larger than in inclusive top - pair production  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the charge asymmetry can be observed in jet - associated top - pair production through top - antitop _ energy _",
    "differences  @xcite .",
    "this so - called energy asymmetry is induced at lo qcd from partonic quark - gluon interactions , which are much more abundant than quark - antiquark states in proton - proton collisions at high energies .",
    "the energy asymmetry is therefore less affected by the gluon - gluon background and larger than rapidity asymmetries .",
    "since the definition of the energy asymmetry relies on the jet kinematics , it is important to know the impact of qcd corrections on the observable . in this work ,",
    "we investigate fixed - order nlo corrections and parton - shower effects using monte - carlo methods .",
    "we will show that and why these corrections are moderate and provide improved predictions of the energy asymmetry for the lhc at 13 tev collision energy .    in section  [ sec : observables ] , we review the definition of the energy asymmetry and a related optimized observable .",
    "fixed - order nlo qcd corrections are discussed in section  [ sec : nlo ] from a qualitative viewpoint and in section  [ sec : lhc ] numerically for the 13-tev lhc .",
    "parton - shower effects from multi - parton emission are the topic of section  [ sec : shower ] . in section",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] , we show how to enhance the energy asymmetry with kinematic cuts and present our final predictions for the lhc .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with an outlook on the discovery prospects of the asymmetry .",
    "the top - antitop energy asymmetry as an observable of the charge asymmetry was first introduced in reference  @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the definition and properties of the energy asymmetry , as well as of an optimized observable  @xcite . for details , we refer the reader to these two articles .    the _ energy asymmetry _ in top - pair production requires the detection of an associated jet . in the process @xmath4 , the energy asymmetry is defined as  @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the difference between the top and antitop energies . the angle @xmath7 is defined as the scattering angle of the hardest jet with respect to the direction of the incoming parton @xmath8 of the process @xmath9 . both @xmath10 and @xmath7",
    "are defined in the @xmath11 rest frame , which at lo corresponds with the parton cm frame . at the parton level ,",
    "the energy asymmetry is generated mainly from quark - gluon initial states .",
    "an exemplary feynman diagram contributing to the energy asymmetry at lo is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : diag1 ]  @xmath12 . at this level ,",
    "the energy asymmetry is equivalent to a forward - backward asymmetry of the quark - jet in the top - antitop rest frame .",
    "contributions to @xmath13 from the quark - antiquark initial state are small and vanish when integrated over a range symmetric around @xmath14 .",
    "the total energy asymmetry @xmath15 is obtained by integrating @xmath16 and @xmath17 in ( [ eq : ea ] ) over the range @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the jet angular distribution @xmath13 is shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : fo - lo - nlo ] .",
    "as one can see , @xmath13 is symmetric in @xmath19 , with a minimum at @xmath14 . however , either of the two partonic contributions @xmath20 and @xmath21 has its minimum where the jet is emitted in the direction of the incoming quark , i.e. , for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we will `` guess '' the incoming quark s direction by exploiting the fact that the quark carries a larger fraction of the proton momentum along the beam axis than the gluon .",
    "the final state in quark - gluon interactions thus tends to be boosted in the quark direction .",
    "we quantify this boost in terms of the rapidity of the top - antitop - jet cm frame , @xmath24 , which at the lo is connected with the proton momentum fractions of @xmath8 and @xmath25 via @xmath26 .",
    "this allows us to define an _",
    "optimized energy asymmetry _ as  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath7 and @xmath28 are defined as in ( [ eq : ea ] ) , with an additional cut on the boost , @xmath24 . by associating forward ( @xmath29 ) and backward ( @xmath30 ) boosted final states with forward ( @xmath31 $ ] ) and backward ( @xmath32 $ ] ) scattered jets , we combine the maximum contributions from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 channels in the range @xmath31 $ ] . in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : fo - lo - nlo ] , we show the jet angular distribution of the optimized energy asymmetry .",
    "the minimum of @xmath35 lies around @xmath36 and is deeper than for @xmath13 .",
    "is tailored to the kinematics of the partonic quark - gluon channel , quark - antiquark contributions deplete its minimum ( see also reference  @xcite ) . however",
    ", this effect is small due to the low quark - antiquark abundance in proton - proton collisions at the lhc . ] in our numerical analysis in section  [ sec : kinematics ] , we will focus on this optimized energy asymmetry .",
    "occasionally , we will compare the energy asymmetry to the widely investigated _ rapidity asymmetries _ at the tevatron , @xmath37 and at the lhc , @xmath38 the top and antitop rapidities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are defined in the laboratory frame .",
    "the script @xmath41 is used if the top - antitop pair is produced in association with a hard jet .",
    "the rapidity asymmetry is generated from the quark - antiquark initial state and , unlike the energy asymmetry , does not require a hard jet in the final state . in the presence of an observed jet ,",
    "however , @xmath42 is strongly reduced by qcd corrections at nlo  @xcite , as we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this fact raises the question if a similar effect occurs for the energy asymmetry . in what follows",
    ", we will discuss qcd corrections to the energy asymmetry in detail and explain why their impact is moderate .     and @xmath43 ) and at lo ( @xmath12).,height=201 ]",
    "the properties of the energy asymmetry at nlo are closely related to the kinematics of the observed jet .",
    "we can obtain a qualitative understanding by analyzing the cross section and the asymmetry in the limit of soft and collinear jet emission .",
    "the jet distribution of the cross section , @xmath44 , is displayed in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : fo - lo - nlo ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the effect of these cuts on the jet distribution of the optimized energy asymmetry and its normalization is displayed in figure  [ fig : kin - cuts ] .",
    "the cut on @xmath45 is very efficient in enhancing the asymmetry ( red curves ) .",
    "however , this comes at the price of sacrificing a large portion of the cross section in the central - jet region around @xmath46 , where the asymmetry is largest and most precisely predicted . a lower cut on the boost @xmath47 ( blue curves ) , in turn , reduces the gluon - gluon background , ergo the cross section in the collinear regime @xmath48 .",
    "by combining both cuts we can find an optimal balance of enhancing the absolute asymmetry and preserving a sizeable data set . in our exemplary set of combined cuts , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the optimized energy asymmetry reaches @xmath51 in its minimum ( purple curves ) .",
    "since the optimized energy asymmetry is largest near @xmath52 , a further cut on the jet scattering angle should be applied .",
    "this cut can be expressed in terms of the jet rapidity in the @xmath11 frame , @xmath53 , which can be measured as the difference between the jet rapidity and the final - state boost in the laboratory frame  @xcite , @xmath54 in table  [ tab : predictions ] , we present our predictions of the optimized energy asymmetry @xmath55 and the corresponding cross section @xmath56 at nlo qcd for various combinations of kinematic cuts . in the three tables ,",
    "the observables have been integrated over different ranges of the jet angle @xmath7 ( or the corresponding jet rapidity @xmath53 ) .",
    "the errors correspond to scale variations @xmath57\\,m_t$ ] .",
    "notice that the scale uncertainty is much reduced when cuts on @xmath7 are applied .",
    "this feature can be understood from figure  [ fig : scale ] , where the small panels show that the relative scale uncertainty is largest in the regions around @xmath58 .",
    "the improved precision of @xmath55 for @xmath46 is another strong argument for applying cuts on the jet direction . in our example with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the relative scale uncertainty of the asymmetry in the range @xmath59",
    "is no more than @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite , we have estimated the statistical uncertainty of the energy asymmetry at lo for various assumptions on the experimental luminosity and efficiency . since nlo effects on the asymmetry are moderate , the main conclusion from this analysis persists : a statistical significance of @xmath85 standard deviations , often considered the discovery level , is expected to be in reach within the current run of the lhc at 13 tev .",
    "in this work , we have advocated the energy asymmetry as an observable of the charge asymmetry in jet - associated top - antitop production .",
    "our main goal was to answer the question if the energy asymmetry is stable under qcd corrections .",
    "to this end , we have calculated fixed - order nlo qcd contributions to the energy asymmetry .",
    "corrections are moderate and most pronounced for jet emission collinear to the incoming partons ( see figure  [ fig : fo - lo - nlo ] ) . in this region ,",
    "new virtual nlo contributions enhance the asymmetry over its lo prediction . in the region of jet emission perpendicular to the incoming partons , where the absolute asymmetry is largest , nlo corrections are of a few percent only .",
    "to estimate the uncertainty of our predictions , we have analyzed their dependence on the factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "while the inclusion of nlo contributions reduces the scale dependence of the cross section , it enhances the scale uncertainty of the asymmetry near the endpoints of the jet distribution  ( see figure  [ fig : scale ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the renormalization scale dependence no longer cancels between the numerator and denominator of the asymmetry , once nlo contributions are taken into account .",
    "the uncertainty is of a few percent only for perpendicular jet emission , but reaches several tens of percent in the collinear region .",
    "these observations suggest to apply a cut on the jet angle @xmath7 that removes events with collinear jet emission .",
    "the asymmetry can be further enhanced by applying kinematic cuts on the top - antitop energy difference , @xmath10 , and the boost of the final state , @xmath24 ( figure  [ fig : kin - cuts ] ) .",
    "our final results are shown in table  [ tab : predictions ] , where we make predictions for the optimized energy asymmetry at the lhc with @xmath86 .",
    "for instance , with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath50 , corresponding to a cross section of @xmath89 , an asymmetry of @xmath90 can be reached . with tighter cuts ,",
    "the asymmetry can be enhanced even more , but at the cost of further reducing the data set .",
    "experimentally , the sensitivity to the energy asymmetry around its minimum might be improved by using dedicated reconstruction techniques for boosted top - quarks  ( which has recently been done for the rapidity asymmetry at the lhc  @xcite ) .    beyond fixed - order qcd",
    ", we have investigated the effect of multi - parton emission on the energy asymmetry ( see figure  [ fig : ps ] ) . due to the strong cut on the jet s transverse momentum ,",
    "the impact of the parton shower on the observables is rather small in the region of perpendicular jet emission .",
    "however , the shower affects the collinear region , where effects are generally expected to be larger . in this work ,",
    "we have confined ourselves to a basic study of the parton shower .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis would be very welcome , in particular to investigate the impact of the parton shower in the presence of kinematic cuts .",
    "we hope that our predictions can serve as a basis for a measurement of the top charge asymmetry at the lhc .",
    "the energy asymmetry surpasses rapidity - based asymmetries in magnitude by far .",
    "this makes us confident that systematic uncertainties of the experimental analysis can be reduced to a level that facilitates a discovery during run ii .",
    "obviously , the theory prediction of the energy asymmetry can be further improved by investigating the effects of top - quark decay  @xcite and by including nnlo qcd corrections , as well as soft - gluon resummation .",
    "the careful investigation of the rapidity asymmetries at the tevatron and the lhc has shown that such improvements are possible with the joint effort and ability of our community .",
