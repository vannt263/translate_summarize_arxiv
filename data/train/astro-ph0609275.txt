    "the magnificent seven ( m7 ) , as the rosat - discovered x - ray thermal isolated neutron stars are sometimes dubbed , are exceptional because of their soft blackbody - like spectra without non - thermal components ; for reviews see e.g. haberl 2006 ( this volume ) or @xcite .",
    "one of them has the second - best blackbody spectrum after the cosmic background radiation and this lead to one of the best neutron star radius estimates known @xcite .",
    "thought to be nearby , the m7 represent nearly half of the local young neutron star population . despite several searches for new candidates of this radio - quiet neutron star class ( e.g. @xcite ) , no new m7-like object has been confirmed up to now .",
    "one aggravating circumstance these searches face is the hardening of the x - ray spectrum due to the interstellar absorption .",
    "caused mainly by photo - electric absorption of photons by heavy elements , the interstellar absorption is usually described by the equivalent hydrogen column density assuming certain chemical abundances .",
    "highly important is the clumpiness of the interstellar medium ( ism ) causing ( un)favourable lines of sights to search for new m7-like objects .",
    "the knowledge about the local ism structure is also important in connection with the long - debated issue of isolated neutron stars accreting from the ism .",
    "[ abundances ] most absorption models today presume element abundances independent of the line of sight .",
    "it was outlined by @xcite that the total gas plus dust ism abundances are lower than the local  solar  abundances and the general ism abundance uncertainties are still in the order of 0.1  dex because the measurements are very difficult .",
    "one can choose between several different abundance tables implemented e.g. in @xmath0 for analysing x - ray spectra .",
    "we note here only two examples commonly used ",
    "the abundance tables by @xcite ( angr in @xmath0 ) and by @xcite ( wilm in @xmath0 ) considering newer measurements by e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ the individual abundances and photoionization cross - sections of the elements and their ions as well as dust grain properties ( e.g. sizes , shapes ) influence the total photo - electric absorption of x - rays .",
    "again , we mention here only two examplary works used very often for analysis of x - ray spectra .",
    "@xcite did a polynomial fit of the effective absorption cross - section per hydrogen atom based on measured atomic absorption cross - sections by @xcite and abundances mostly from @xcite . with the exception of oxygen ,",
    "@xcite assume the elements to be either entirely in the gas phase or completely depleted into dust grains .",
    "the recent improved absorption treatment by @xcite takes into account newer element abundances as noted above and more recent photoionization cross - section calculations by e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite additionally include an improved molecular cross - section for @xmath1 .",
    "besides this updated database @xcite considered furthermore a simple spherical composite dust grain model in an mrn distribution @xcite .",
    "+ both models are implemented in @xmath0 and can be used via the routines @xmath2 @xcite or @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the various absorption descriptions can lead to different results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abun ] ) or expectations of e.g. observable objects .",
    "the differences caused by the diverse treatments show our incomplete knowledge about the interstellar absorption and should be kept in mind especially when interpreting soft x - ray spectra .",
    "routines @xmath3 and @xmath2 are calculated for different distances .",
    "the galactic coordinate @xmath4 varies from 50 to 2500  pc ( direction : from the sun towards the galactic center ) , @xmath5 is always 0 , @xmath6 is 25 pc north . for the ism distribution",
    ", we applied the same as used by @xcite , which is described in more detail below .",
    "the effect of less absorption , resulting from the use of the newer routine tbabs , is stronger at larger column densities , hence distances .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]       is pointing up .",
    "the image spans 500  pc times 500  pc .",
    "the area within the contour has low column densities ( @xmath7 n@xmath8 ) for which @xcite doubted whether the @xcite formula is applicable .",
    "this region of small sodium column densities is largest at z=0 and becomes smaller for lower or larger z. , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in x - ray astronomy with low spectroscopic resolution the chosen abundances and cross - sections are used to derive the hydrogen column density responsible for the instellar absorption .",
    "cold and warm h - atoms ( hi ) as well as hydrogen molecules and ionized hydrogen ( hii ) contribute to the overall amount of hydrogen along a line of sight .",
    "these different components of the hydrogen column density are estimated by different measurement methods , e.g. various extinction measurements as summarized by @xcite or radio 21-cm observations of hydrogen as the extensive study by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "a wealth of theoretical models has been applied to these observations . however , most of them are only 2d with few more recent exceptions",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for 3d models ) .",
    "the overall result is a highly inhomogeneously distributed interstellar medium within the milky way , present in bubbles with loops or dense rims , and shaped by molecular clouds , supernova explosions and stellar activity ( for an illustrated overview see @xcite ) .",
    "the ism distribution is best known in the close solar neighbourhood , especially in the local bubble ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most detailed view is provided by the study of @xcite , who measured na absorption towards 1005 sightlines with hipparcos distances up to 350 pc from the sun ; for more details on the measurements and the applied density inversion method see @xcite , the precursor paper @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "na is regarded as good tracer of the total amount of the neutral interstellar gas and the sodium column density is thought to be convertable into a hydrogen column density ( e.g. @xcite , but see also discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] ) . for more distant regions",
    "the determination of a 3d distribution of the ism is hampered mainly by the unknown or imprecise distances of the measured objects and the lack of a well - sampled grid of measurement points .",
    "this is true for all extinction - related methods to our knowledge and results in much more coarse sampling compared to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the results obtained by the various methods can differ for the same regions and a combination can be difficult .",
    "these difficulties result partly from the different observed astrophysical phenomena like measuring the dust emission or stellar magnitudes .",
    "they also result from different sets of stellar absolute magnitude calibrations and the underlying assumptions which can deviate from each other as interstellar extinction determination is an iterative process coupled with the identification of the statistical properties of stars @xcite .",
    "is in the center .",
    "the n(h)is in units of @xmath9@xmath10 . for description of the model and discussion see text.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "considering the absorption in the solar neighbourhood , the result by @xcite is a good starting point representing the currently best database of the local ism distribution .",
    "r.  lallement kindly provided us with the na density cube derived using the inversion method developed by @xcite . due to the smoothing length of 25  pc applied in this method by @xcite ,",
    "structures smaller than 25  pc can not be resolved .",
    "we note further that even if measurements go up to hipparcos distances of 350  pc from the sun , the sampling becomes coarser at larger distances .",
    "thus the sodium density cube has a span of only 250  pc and starting from 200  pc one has to be careful dealing eventually with the a priori density information applied in the inversion method ( r.  lallement , personal communication ) . from the na density cube",
    "we calculate the column density for the same grid ( sampling 3.9  pc ) .",
    "this is then converted to hi column density applying the formula by @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that there are on - going discussions about how well the sodium d - line absorption actually traces hi .",
    "the correlation found between the hi and na column densities derived from na - d absorption lines by @xcite was doubted by @xcite , especially for low column densities ( @xmath7 n@xmath8 ) .",
    "the region of the lallement cube that should not be used because it has such low column densities is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lal ] .",
    "is in the center .",
    "the n(h ) scale is in unities of @xmath9@xmath10 . for description of the model and discussion",
    "see text.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    however , the lowest known x - ray  measured hydrogen column density for one of the m7 converts to a sodium column density of @xmath7 n(na ) @xmath11 ( applying the formula by @xcite ) . therefore this low - column density uncertainty is not important considering the m7 and negligible for the intended population synthesis with neutron stars ( nss ) at usually larger distances .",
    "+ @xcite could not always find a correlation of the na density with the hi density .",
    "they concluded that the correlation is rather weak due to non - constant population ratios for interstellar medium species , thus different abundances .",
    "@xcite noted the size of the local bubble revealed by hi is smaller than when derived by na .",
    "this was explained by the first ionization stage of na being below that of hi , resulting in a longer neutral phase of hi @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented new ultraviolet na observations towards 74 o- and b - type stars in the galactic disk .",
    "where possible they also derived column densities of the na d - lines .",
    "then they compared the correlation between the na and hi column densities .",
    "while there was an excellent agreement with @xcite for the d - lines , this was not the case for their ultraviolet absorption lines .",
    "@xcite found a significant offset for the correlation they got from the na d - lines compared to the relation derived from the uv transitions , even after accounting for saturation effects in the d - lines .",
    "they argue that this offset is due to an underestimation of approximately 30 @xmath12 of n(h ) in the case of na d - lines observations .",
    "recapitulating , one has to be aware of the still not completely solved problems concerning the conversion of na to hi column densities when it comes to interpreting individual results . however , we regard the measurements by @xcite and the conversion to a hydrogen column density according to @xcite as the best possibility at hand to take into account the local inhomogenity in the ism for x - ray astronomy with low spectral resolution .        at larger distances",
    "we consider two different models ",
    "one is based completely on extinction measurements and another one is described by analytical formulae .",
    "@xcite put several extinction studies carefully together in an easily accessible routine .",
    "all studies have been modified to statistically account for unsampled regions . additionally , a correction method for the systematic underestimation between 1 and 5 kpc was developed .",
    "errors were provided individually for each considered main survey and for their mean . the often large mean",
    "error values illustrate the disagreement among individual observations .",
    "the model by @xcite is a large scale model , capable of identifying e.g. molecular clouds at intermediate distances , but not sensitve to extinction variations of less than 1  degree .",
    "it is well suited for statistical studies .",
    "+ the analytical model we apply is described by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the formulae by @xcite .",
    "@xcite included additionally a galactocentric radius dependency for the number density of atomic and molecular hydrogen as estimated by @xcite .",
    "the local bubble was taken into account by @xcite as a sphere of 140  pc radius having a constant low density of 0.1 particles @xmath13 .",
    "as noted above , there are other more recent theoretical 3d extinction models .",
    "however , the analytical @xmath14 density model by @xcite seems to be at least as good as e.g. the underlying model used by @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite can not be applied to distances less than a few hundred parsecs in the solar neighbourhood and the data of @xcite has a coarse sampling with distance bins of 1  kpc .",
    "+ both described models are applied only for distances larger than 230  pc in case they provide an n(h ) larger than derived from the sodium cube at 230  pc .",
    "otherwise the hydrogen column density at 230  pc is taken since the column density can only increase with distance .",
    "we use spherical coordinates  the galactic cordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 and distance @xmath17 .",
    "the nominal sampling is one degree in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and 10  pc for the distance .",
    "this is technically motivated and does not represent the actually achieved accuracy .",
    "distances are covered up to 4500  pc .      .",
    "for both models a larger scatter is visible at glon@xmath18,@xmath19 , and @xmath20 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to test our models we first consider a relatively large number of test objects with good distances and extinction measurements , not necessarily determined from x - rays .",
    "then we proceed to a few of the rare neutron stars with well known distances , having also small error bars for the absorbing n(h ) derived by x - ray observations .",
    "+ as @xcite note , different studies do not agree precisely with each other due to the various applied methods or objects studied .",
    "the latter are usually very coarsely scattered and measurement errors can influence the extinction values of a large region .",
    "one possibility to overcome this problem is investigating open clusters .",
    "an open cluster has the advantage that one can measure a number of stars at approximately the same distance , which is usually well known .",
    "therefore , open clusters are a good choice in aiming to minimize the extinction measurement errors along one line of sight .",
    "usually one measures the reddening @xmath21 .",
    "we concentrate here on the recent comprehensive reddening measurements for 650 open clusters by @xcite , representing a complete sample up to distances of about 850  pc from the sun .",
    "details about this open cluster study can be found in @xcite .",
    "to convert the reddening @xmath21 we apply the formula by @xcite : @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "this is quite similar to the slope found in the x - ray study for the extinction @xmath23 by @xcite : @xmath24 $ ] if @xmath25 .",
    "this is noted here because there is a deviation of the correlation by @xcite between @xmath23 , indicator of the dust , and @xmath26 , indicator for cold gas and dust , at low distances .",
    "this is probably due to a significantly lower amount of dust in the local bubble , as also found by @xcite for the source lmc x-1 .",
    "therefore , we consider only open clusters with distances larger than 230  pc .",

    "less sources would be expected at higher latitudes , and towards some small regions the high extinction hinders the possible detection of neutron stars .",
    "differences between the two absorption models are pronounced only in small regions which to discuss in detail is beyond our intention here .",
    "an understanding of the interstellar absorption is crucial for the interpretation of low - resolution soft x - ray spectra .",
    "taking into account the 3d distribution of the ism is important to determine the absorption of known sources as well as for searches of new soft x - ray sources towards a particular direction in the sky .",
    "we presented two simple models for 3d ism distributions together with possible applications : distance estimation and the population synthesis for young isolated thermal , thus soft x - rays emitting neutron stars .",
    "both models are large scale models and have to be used with caution especially considering distance estimations .",
    "concerning population synthesis the two models influence the log@xmath72log@xmath69 curve discriminatively , while the differences for the predicted spatial distribution of observable neutron stars are only small .",
