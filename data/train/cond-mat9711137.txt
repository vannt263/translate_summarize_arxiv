    "recent years have witnessed the demonstration of topologically nontrivial spin textures like skyrmions as physically important excitations in quantum hall systems .",
    "it has been argued in a body of very interesting papers that such skyrmions are not mere exotic theoretical curiosities but will actually be the lowest energy excitations in some situations ( such as for example filling factor @xmath1 and small zeeman coupling ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental evidence indicating the presence of such skyrmionic excitations has also subsequently emerged @xcite .",
    "skyrmions of topological charge more than unity have also been studied @xcite .",
    "these results were basically for mono - layers of electron gas in strong magnetic fields , but with spin degrees of freedom of the electrons treated dynamically .",
    "meanwhile , the remarkable discoveries of the quantum hall effect , originally found in single two dimensional electron layers , have also been extended to bilayer systems , thanks to the development of techniques for growing gaas heterostructures containing two separated layers of two - dimensional electron gas ( see for example references @xcite ) . on the theoretical front , a large body of work",
    "has already been done on bilayer systems .",
    "an extensive list of references to this literature has been given in the lucid review of this subject by girvin and macdonald @xcite and in the paper by moon et al @xcite .",
    "to simplify matters , one may begin analysing bilayer systems by assuming , to start with , that the electrons are spinless , i.e. that the spins of the electrons are fully polarised by the strong magnetic field and frozen as degrees of freedom",
    ". the idea would be to later incorporate the complications brought about by spin degrees of freedom after the spinless problem is understood . however , even when real physical spin is suppressed , it is helpful to view electrons in a bilayer system as carrying a `` pseudospin '' in addition to their spatial coordinates on the plane .",
    "the notion of such a pseudospin arises from mapping the bilayer spinless problem into a monolayer problem with spin @xcite . in this mapping",
    "the layer degree of freedom is specified by a two - component pseudospinor whose up and down components refer to the amplitude for the electron to be in the first and second layers respectively .",
    "such a mapping allows one to borrow for bilayer systems , the rich body of insights and results available from single layer systems with real spin .",
    "for instance , just as in case of electrons with real spin the combination of the pauli principle and coulomb interactions can lead to a ferromagnetic ground state , one can similarly expect the pseudospin of bilinear systems to also be fully `` polarised '' under corresponding circumstances .",
    "such psuedospin magnetisation amounts to spontaneous phase coherence between the two layers , with many interesting consequences , discussed in the literature @xcite,@xcite .",
    "going beyond the ground state , the relevance of skyrmions to systems with real spin has in turn prompted studies of similar topological excitations in spinless bilayer systems , but now involving ( see references @xcite,@xciteand references given therein ) .",
    "because of interplane - intraplane anisotropy in pseudospin stiffness in bilayer systems , as well the capacitance energy of carrying unequal charge density in the two layers , the effective action governing pseudospin enjoys only u(1 ) symmetry of rotations about the z - axis ( the direction perpendicular to the x - y plane of the layers ) .",
    "finiteness of energy requires that asymptotically the pseudospin must lie on the easy ( x - y ) plane .",
    "the basic topological excitations in that case are the so - called merons which are vortices in pseudospin with a winding number of one - half , and meron anti - meron bound pairs .",
    "such a pair is topologically equivalent to skyrmions and carries unit winding number .",
    "( for an introduction to such topological excitations , their winding numbers , requirements due to finite energy , etc .",
    "see reference @xcite . )    in this paper we obtain single meron solutions in bilayer systems with filling fraction @xmath2 , for a range of different values of system parameters ( such as the inter layer separation @xmath3 ) by numerically solving the integro differential equation obeyed by them .",
    "even though a single meron by itself has a logarithmically divergent energy in the infinite volume limit it is nevertheless an object of interest .",
    "physical meron anti - meron solutions which do have finite energy , are often treated as a bound pair of two extended interacting objects , namely the individual merons each with a `` size '' and a meron core energy .",
    "merons are not rigid bodies but rather solutions of nonlinear wave equations ; the notion of giving each of them a fixed size , shape and energy , although only approximate when they appear as a part of a larger solution containing other merons , is nevertheless useful in such soliton physics .",
    "single meron solutions allow us to obtain their size , shape and individual energy in an unambiguous way .",
    "single meron and bi - meron solutions have already been extensively studied in a body of papers by girvin , macdonald and co - workers @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on optimising microscopic wavefunctions with respect to the microscopic interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the emphasis is on determining the optimised energy of bimeron configurations and extracting individual meron core sizes and energies from them .",
    "our work here relies heavily on the advances already made in these papers , and is to be viewed as something which will hopefully augment their calculations .",
    "we will obtain explicit meron solutions through a somewhat _ different _ route , by numerically integrating the nonlinear differential equations derived from the effective action obeyed by the pseudospin magnetic moments .",
    "meron profiles are of some interest in their own right .",
    "[ it is for instance not widely realised that unlike skyrmions which exist even in the pure nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) limit , that model will not permit exact meron solutions .",
    "meron solutions require departure from the nlsm model , which is provided by the capacitance energy and other anisotropies .",
    "we will explain this point further later on .",
    "] we will obtain our meron profiles for a range of values of the layer distance and study the way in which the solution is affected by the addition of leading corrections to the nlsm effective action .",
    "we also compare our results for the meron size and core energy with those obtained from other methods .",
    "the integro - differential equation which we will integrate to get our meron solutions is obtained by extremising an effective action which has already been derived by moon _ et al _ @xcite starting from the basic microscopic physics .",
    "see also ezawa @xcite . for completeness , and to set up the notation let us quickly recall their result .",

    "@xmath5 is the coordinate on the x - y plane carrying the layers , while the magnetic field b is along the z - direction .",
    "the fully polarised `` ferromagnetic '' ground state @xmath6 corresponds to @xmath7 pointing everywhere in the same direction , say , along the x - axis . using this as the reference state , any other state with some arbitrary texture @xmath4 is given by performing a local pseudospin rotation on this uniform ground state :",

    "* *    the effective action @xmath12 $ ] is just the expectation value of the microscopic hamiltonian in the state @xmath17 , but with all operators projected on to the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",

    "this extremisation one has to respect the condition that @xmath7 is a unit vector .",
    "we handle this by writing @xmath7 in terms of independent fields @xmath28 and @xmath15 such that = (   cos ,    sin ,  m_z ) as one can see @xmath29 is the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath30 in the x - y plane . upon rewriting @xmath27 $ ] in terms of the independent fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and minimising with respect to them we get the field equations    2m_z-_a^2m_z-_e m_z ( + + ^2 )   + +   d^2rd^2 r ( )  =  0 [ mz ] and .=0 [ alpha ]    we will numerically solve these coupled equations for the variables @xmath28 and @xmath15 . in the case of the skyrmion and bi - meron solutions",
    "people have found it helpful to begin with the isotropic nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) limit of the effective action and field equations , whose analytical solutions are exactly known .",
    "these exact solutions offer a starting point for setting up trial functions for numerically solving the full equations . in the case of the meron however , there is no exact single meron solution to the nlsm . to see this",
    "let us briefly consider the nlsm limit .",
    "the su(2 ) invariant nlsm limit is obtained when the layer separation vanishes ( @xmath33 ) . at the level of the microcopic hamiltonian",
    "one can see that it is rotationally ( su(2 ) ) invariant in pseudospin in the limit of zero separation .",
    "the potential energy in ( [ hi ] ) and ( [ int ] ) is layer independent when d = 0 , and in the lll approximation the kinetic term ( [ hk ] ) involving the magnetic field is just a constant .",
    "this symmetry is also reflected in the effective action @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "with@xmath3= 0 , we see from their definitions that @xmath34 while @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "then the effective action in ( [ eff ] ) reduces to just the nlsm .",
    "the equation for @xmath28 in turn reduces to + + m_z^2= 0 [ nlsm ] while [ alpha ] remains the same .",
    "the nlsm has been fully solved @xcite and its solutions are most conveniently described in terms of the complex field w(z ) defined by w(z ) where z = x+iy .",
    "any analytic function w(z ) will be a solution of the nlsm .",
    "in particular , the single skyrmion solution is @xmath36 , which corresponds in polar coordinates @xmath37 to the circularly symmetrical function with m_z = r^2 - ^2 r^2 + ^2   and  = [ skyr ] it can be checked that ( [ skyr ] ) satisfies equation ( [ nlsm ] )    now , isolated meron or anti - meron solutions may be defined by the boundary conditions m_z(r=0 )   & = &  1 + and   m_z  =   0  ;  m_x + im_y  & = &  exp(i ) ,   as  r   [ bc ] solutions with such boundary conditions may or may not exist for a given equation .",
    "in fact we will argue that the basic nlsm has no meron solutions .",
    "but the nlsm does have a skyrmion solution of the form ( [ skyr ] ) .",
    "the notion of a meron stems from the _ portion _ of the skyrmion function ( [ skyr ] ) from r = 0 to @xmath38 . in this portion",
    "the circle of radius @xmath39 in the z - plane is mapped onto the unit circle in the w - plane .",
    "the spin begins at r = 0 with @xmath40 starts tilting towards the x - y plane , and by @xmath38 is lying entirely on the x - y plane , pointing radially outward . the topological number density _ when integrated over this portion _ , is one - half .",
    "sometimes this portion is called a meron , i.e. half a skyrmion .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that this object corresponds only to a piece of the full skyrmion function and is not a solution to the field equations in the full x - y plane . in contrast",
    "an `` isolated single meron solution '' to the field equation , while qualitatively similar , should span the whole x - y plane and not just a portion of it .",
    "that is , it should satisfy the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) at infinity and not at some finite @xmath38 .",
    "such a solution does not exist . the easiest way to understand this is to note that there exists no analytical function w(z ) which maps the z - plane into a unit circle in the w - plane .",
    "equivalently , if one tried to solve the differential equation [ nlsm ] starting with @xmath41 at r=0 and _ any _ positive slope , one will always end up with a skyrmion , i.e. with @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "note that this is not directly related to the fact that an isolated meron , if it existed , would have a logarithmically divergent energy .",
    "solutions can exist to diferential equations with some boundary conditions , even if they have infinite value for the energy functional .",
    "but in the case of merons , no such solution exists for the nlsm .",
    "when the layer separation @xmath3 is non - zero , then the full effective action ( [ eff ] ) comes into play and we have no longer just the nlsm .",
    "the arguments of the preceding subsection do not hold and now meron solutions can exist . see affleck @xcite for arguments show that in fact they will exist when @xmath25 in eq ( [ mz ] ) is non - zero .",
    "we will look for spherically symmetric solutions with @xmath45 which will satisfy eq([alpha ] ) provided @xmath46 depends only on the radius r .",
    "then eq ( [ mz ] ) requires that @xmath47 satisfy    @xmath48    the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the equation are calculated for each value of the layer separation @xmath3 from their definitions ( [ rho ] and [ beta ] ) .",
    "as it stands ( [ mzeq ] ) is a nonlinear integro - differential equation .",
    "it is the nonlocal integral in the last term which represents the most difficult part of this equation . to start with",
    "let us neglect this term .",
    "we are then left with a nonlinear ordinary second order differential equation given by 2m_z-_a(_r^2m_z+_rm_z ) -_e (  + +  ) [ mzeq2 ]    we will first solve this equation and then later on return to the full equation ( [ mzeq ] ) including the last integral term . to solve ( [ mzeq2 ] ) numerically",
    "we merely start with a boundary value and slope for @xmath28 at r = 0 , obtain @xmath51 using the equation ( [ mzeq ] ) , use this to get the value and slope at the next point in r , and thus proceed towards @xmath52 .",
    "one can see that the aymptotic behaviour of @xmath53 must be   m_z  & = &  1 - ar^2 + o(r^3 )   as  r 0 + and   m_z  & ~ &  exp(-kr )   as  r [ asymp ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a constant for a given layer separation d. the absence of an @xmath56 term in @xmath57 follows from the requirement that our solution not have a cusp at r = 0 .",
    "one may be concerned that the last term ( proportional to @xmath21 ) in eq ( [ mzeq2 ] ) appears to have pieces with an @xmath58 singularity at r = 0 .",
    "it must be remembered that @xmath59 also behaves as @xmath58 .",
    "however it can be checked that the requirement ( [ asymp ] ) ensures that the @xmath58 singularities in the different pieces cancel one another , regardless of the value of the constant @xmath55 .",
    "this constant @xmath55 is adjusted so that @xmath28 exponentially falls to zero as @xmath60 as required .",
    "the resulting solutions of eq ( [ mzeq2 ] ) for @xmath53 are plotted in figure 1 for a range of 6 different values of @xmath3 = 0.24 , 0.50 , 0.625 , 0.78 , 1.00 , 1.20 and 1.50 respectively in units of the magnetic length _",
    "each solution falls monotonically to zero as @xmath61 increases with an exponential fall as @xmath52 as required by([asymp ] ) . comparing solutions for different values of the interlayer distance @xmath3 , we see that the width ( mean radius ) of the solution monotonically decreases with @xmath3 , the outermost curve shown in fig.1 corresponding to @xmath62 and the inner most to @xmath63 .",
    "the physics behind this is the minimisation of the capacitance energy @xmath64 , which would tend to bring @xmath28 down to zero as quickly as possible , in contrast to the gradient ( stiffness ) terms would tend to reduce @xmath28 as slowly as possible from its starting value of unity at r = 0 .",
    "as @xmath3 increases so does @xmath50 , while @xmath21 falls with @xmath3 and @xmath20 is independent of @xmath3 ( see equations ( [ beta ] ) and [ beta ] ) .",
    "therefore the relative importance of the capacitance energy to the stiffness terms increases with @xmath3 , and hence the solutions fall to zero faster .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the meron core radius @xmath65 , which we define following the literature @xcite as the radius at which @xmath28 equals 0.1 .",
    "as noted above this radius falls monotonically with @xmath3 . in fig.2",
    "we show our values of @xmath65 for 8 different values of @xmath3 , while for comparison the results of yang and macdonald ( extracted from fig.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are shown in the form of a curve .",
    "they consider their results to be reliable in the region @xmath66d@xmath67 . in this range",
    "our values of @xmath65 are of the same order of magnitude as theirs but about 30 to 40 percent smaller .",
    "the qualitative behavior as a function of @xmath3 is very similar .",
    "the energy of the meron , i.e. the value of the effective action for the meron solution will diverge logarithmically if evaluated over the entire plane because of its nonvanishing azimuthal gradient .",
    "however the notion of a `` meron core energy '' applies to the energy of the meron function evaluated upto @xmath68 .  in fig.3",
    "we plot @xmath69 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "since single merons have , strictly speaking , divergent energy , physical finite energy excitations involving merons must come in the form of meron - antimeron pairs , which do have finite energy .",
    "using @xmath69 one can make a phenomenological estimate of the energy @xmath70 of such meron pairs as pointed out in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "following them we can approximately write the energy of a pair separated by a distance r in the form e_mp  =  2e_mc + 2 _ e",
    "ln(r / r_mc ) + e^2 4 r [ mp ] the optimal value @xmath71 of the meron separation can be obtained by minimising this energy with respect to r to get @xmath72 . substituting this value of @xmath71 into the above equation we get e_mp  =  2e_mc + 2",
    "_ e ( 1  +   ln(e^2 8 _ e r_mc ) ) table 1 displays the values of meron core radius , core energy , the merom pair separation and energy as obtained by us , for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "these may be compared to values obtained by others using microscopic hartree fock methods .",
    "we see that for the lower values od @xmath3 , such as 0.24 and 0.5 , the meron separation @xmath71 is either smaller or of the same order as the core radius @xmath65 .",
    "the approximation of two well separated merons is clearly not good at these values of @xmath3 .",
    "equations such as ( [ mp ] ) should be used only at layer separation @xmath3 beyond 0.6 .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of yang and macdonald @xcite .",
    "finally we include the non - local integral ( the last term ) in the original field equation ( [ mzeq ] ) which we had neglected so far .",
    "it arose in this equation as the functional derivative @xmath73 \\over \\delta m_z } $ ] of the term @xmath74 $ ] in the effective action ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "the presence of this term not only makes the equation more difficult to solve , but also alters to some extent the nature of the solution . notice that this term behaves for large @xmath61 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "this @xmath77 behavior will not permit an exponential fall off of @xmath28 as had happened in the solutions in the absence of this term , shown in figure 1 .",
    "instead the solution can be expected to fall to zero asymptotically only as some inverse power of @xmath61 .",
    "further , the value of the constant c for most values of @xmath3 of interest is positive . for large @xmath61 the solution for @xmath28 , may therefore approach zero from below .",
    "these expectations are supported by the numerical solution of the integro - differential equation ( [ mzeq ] ) .",
    "we solve it by the following iterative procedure .",
    "start with the solution @xmath78 of eq([mzeq2 ] ) , where the above - mentioned integral has been altogether neglected .",
    "evaluate the integral by inserting @xmath78 in its integrand .",
    "multiply the resulting integral by a prefactor @xmath79 , add it to eq.([mzeq2 ] ) , and solve the equation again to obtain @xmath80 .",
    "solve the equation again after inserting this @xmath80 into the integral , call the solution @xmath81 , and repeat this procedure ten times until you get @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath83 this should yield a good approximation to the full equation ( [ mzeq ] ) .",
    "one could have used this iterative procedure in smaller steps , but we find the step size of @xmath79 is small enough for the procedure to converge smoothly .    in figure 4",
    "we compare the solution so obtained for the full equation ( [ mzeq ] ) with the `` unperturbed '' solution ( of the simpler eq ( [ mzeq2 ] ) discussed earlier ) , for two values of @xmath3 equal to 0.625 and 1.20 .",
    "one can see that the full solution reaches zero , and then after turning negative , returns to zero asymptotically but more slowly than the unperturbed solution . in other words",
    "the pseudospin , which starts out pointing along the z - axis at r=0 , gradually falls towards the x - y plane , lies entirely on the x - y plane at some finite radius , then starts bending towards the negative z - axis , then reverses its behavior to finally asymptotically come back to the x - y plane at infinity .",
    "we see no objection to such a meron solution . but",
    "the notion of a core may be less meaningful now .",
    "one could formally evaluate the `` meron core radius @xmath84 '' of this new solution defined once again as the radius at which @xmath85 , and a corresponding core energy . but with the solution continuing to be substantially nonzero at radii quite a bit larger than such an @xmath84 , the concept of a core is less significant for such slowly falling solutions .",
