    "quantum spin ice ( qsi ) is the name given to a class of magnetic system on the pyrochlore lattice which exhibit a competition between classical frustration and quantum fluctuations.@xcite the particular kind of quantum fluctuations acting within the set of classical spin ice states ( characterized by their induction of a pauling residual entropy ) leads to a promising avenue to search for the elusive quantum spin liquid@xcite ( qsl ) state among an actively studied set of real compounds.@xcite recently , huang , chen , and hermele@xcite have proposed a specialized model of qsi , relevant to strong spin - orbit coupled materials exhibiting kramers doublets with dipolar - octupolar character in @xmath4-and @xmath5-electron systems .",
    "the model has several competing diagonal and off - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian , and is believed to harbor both gapless and gapped spin liquids in different parameter regimes . from this three - dimensional ( 3d ) hamiltonian , the model can be reduced to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hamiltonian of interacting spins on the kagome lattice .",
    "@xcite this model , which we call _ quantum kagome ice _",
    "( qki ) , opens a theoretical and experimental avenue to search for two - dimensional qsl phases within the broader context of qsi physics .",
    "most importantly from a theoretical perspective , the quantum kagome ice hamiltonian ( like the original huang - chan - hermele hamiltonian ) is devoid of the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) `` sign problem '' , allowing for systematic study of the phase diagram via large scale computer simulations .",
    "as mentioned above , the model hamiltonian for quantum kagome ice studied by carrasquillia _",

    "@xcite originates from a certain class of @xmath4-and @xmath5-electron systems in which dipolar - octupolar kramers doublets arise on the sites of the pyrochlore lattice.@xcite in the localized limit , this model maps to a well - known xyz hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "it is known to exhibit two distinct phases on the pyrochlore lattice  dipolar qsi and octupolar qsi phases .",
    "@xcite in the presence of a magnetic field along the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction there is a partial lifting of degeneracy .",
    "the magnetic field pins one spin per tetrahedron and the model effectively decouples into alternating kagome and triangular layers of the original pyrochlore structure .",

    "for very large @xmath1 , a fully polarized ( fp ) phase occurs with spins aligned along the @xmath17-direction .",
    "the nontrivial phases appear in the regime @xmath23 and @xmath24 and are called `` lobes '' on the phase diagram .",
    "the lobes have magnetization per site @xmath25 depending on the sign of @xmath1 , arising from the constraint that two spins point up and two down ( or vice - versa ) , per unit cell of 3 sites .",
    "these lobes were described in ref .  [ ] as a candidate gapped featureless qsl state , with no evidence of conventional ordering of any kind .    in this paper , we aim to complement the recent quantum monte carlo simulation work by carrasquillia _",

    "we begin with @xmath26 , where the classical ground state is highly degenerate . to first - order in @xmath27 , we show that quantum fluctuations lift the degeneracy by selecting a unique ground state  mirroring what is seen in the qmc .",
    "next , in the @xmath25 lobes ( @xmath3 and @xmath28 with @xmath18 ) the linear spin - wave analysis produces a ground - state energy , magnetization , and `` condensate fraction '' with similar features as the qmc , including the phase transition out of the cfm phase .",
    "the excitation spectrum at @xmath18 displays no soft modes for a wide range of parameter space .",

    "it follows that including a nonzero @xmath1 field , the topology of the classical phase diagram is the same as the xxz model , but the interpretation of the phases is different .",
    "for example , the superfluid phase in the xxz model is replaced by the cfm phase in our case ( @xmath18 ) , which only has a broken @xmath12 symmetry , in contrast to the broken u(1 ) of the superfluid .    at @xmath59",
    ", a phase transition occurs between the cfm phase and a phase with no cfm order , but with a finite magnetization @xmath25 in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "in contrast to the xxz model,@xcite the total @xmath60 is not conserved here , hence these lobes retain a small finite magnetic susceptibility.@xcite also , note that there exists another classical phase boundary between the cfm and the fp state at @xmath61 .",
    "in the previous section , we uncovered the classical phase diagram of the @xmath12-invariant quantum kagome ice model . in this section",
    "we perform a linear spin wave analysis of this model to study the role of quantum fluctuations.@xcite our main goal is to investigate the role of the quantum fluctuations introduced by the @xmath11 term in lifting the extensive degeneracy of the classical ground state . to facilitate the spin wave expansion , we rotate the coordinate axes so that the @xmath17 axis coincides with the local direction of the classical polarization .",
    "we rotate by the angle @xmath62 about the @xmath22 axis , which corresponds to the rotation matrix , @xmath63 following the standard approach,@xcite we employ a three - sublattice holstein primakoff transform with the bosonic operators , @xmath64 .",

    ", we first compute the expectation value of the sublattice magnetization , given by@xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 for the sublattice @xmath130 respectively .",
    "note that the expectation value of @xmath118 plays a role analogous to the condensate fraction in ref .  .",

    "there is a cfm phase with @xmath131 , and an fp phase which appears for @xmath132 ( not shown ) .",
    "in addition , our theory captures the appearance of two @xmath133 lobes for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , with vanishing @xmath110 and @xmath136 .",
    "these lobes are somewhat analogous to the well - known fixed - magnetization lobes of the xxz model,@xcite however , an important difference is that a finite susceptibility is retained throughout the lobes as mentioned above .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the hamiltonian only has @xmath12 symmetry , instead of u(1 ) in the xxz case .",
    "another feature of the phase diagram is that linear spin wave theory captures the same transition point ( @xmath137 ) as qmc simulations @xcite from the lobes to cfm .",

    "these results are consistent with qmc simulations.@xcite      finally , we examine the spin wave dispersion in the @xmath144 lobes . as shown in fig .",
    ", a special feature of the @xmath145 model in zero field is that the spin wave spectrum does not have a soft mode , which is a consequence of the discrete @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "there are two dispersive modes and one flat mode ; the dispersive modes touch at the @xmath146 point ( see fig .",
    "[ kagome ] ) in the brillouin zone and the flat band always has the lowest energy .",
    "the existence of the flat band is a well - known feature of the kagome lattice that follows from its geometry.@xcite when the field reaches the critical value @xmath147 , one of the modes softens signifying the transition to the lobes . in the lobe itself ,",
    "the gap reopens and there are no soft modes again ( see fig .",
    "[ z2_lobe ] ) .",
    "motivated by recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the quantum kagome ice model,@xcite we have presented another perspective of the ground state phase diagram of the model using the large-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "we focused mainly on the @xmath140 model , which has not been studied before using this approach .",
    "exploring the parameter regimes of this model , we uncovered three distinct phases , including a canted ferromagnet ( cfm ) , a fully - polarized ( fp ) state , and most interestingly finite - magnetization @xmath148 `` lobes '' .",
    "this picture is consistent with the phases observed in qmc simulations . at finite magnetic field and dominant ising coupling , the nature of the @xmath148 magnetized lobes is explicitly investigated and we find that all of the observables qualitatively agree with the qmc simulations .",
    "in particular , no evidence of any out - of - plane ( @xmath60 ) spin order , which would be expected in the most likely candidate for valence - bond solid ( vbs ) order is found within the lobes .",
    "however , in order to more thoroughly address the possibility of vbs order within the lobes , it would be prudent to undertake a study using schwinger bosons in the future .",
    "the authors would like to thank juan carrasquilla for invaluable discussions , and also for providing us with details of his qmc simulations .",
    "support was provided by nserc , the canada research chair program , and the perimeter institute ( pi ) for theoretical physics .",
