    "observations of the oldest and coldest white dwarfs following the study of @xcite have revealed two stars showing very unusual wide and deep absorption at 50006000 . in wd2356@xmath2209",
    "this spectroscopic feature is accompanied by a unusual combination of blue and extremely red colours @xcite .",
    "a second star with this absorption feature has been identified in data release 2 of the sloan digital sky survey : sdssj133001.13 + 643523.8 ( hereafter",
    "sdssj1330 + 6435 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also shows indications of an additional strong absorption around 4000 .",
    "these spectra bear intriguing resemblance to the strongly broadened nai and ki resonance doublets observed in cool brown dwarfs of late l or t spectral type @xcite .",
    "collisional broadening of the nai lines in a metal - enriched , extremely dense white dwarf atmosphere thus lent itself as an explanation for these observations .",
    "209 @xcite to ` phoenix ` spectra using different models of the nai line profile .",
    "the first one ( smooth solid line ) is calculated from the unified theory of @xcite in its expansion to the third power in density , the other two are using a lorentzian line shape with the half - widths given by @xcite . ]",
    "[ fig : wd2356 ]    in addition to the nai line the spectrum of wd2356@xmath2209 shows some absorption features indicating the possible presence of other opacity sources . in a previous analysis",
    "we have attempted to model these features with molecular bands expected to form in a cool hydrogen - rich environment @xcite .",
    "in particular , chemical equilibrium models predict mgh and cah absorption around 5000 and 7000 , respectively , for effective temperatures below approximately 5000k . however @xmath3 and resolution of the spectra would not allow the identification of these bands with certainty . on the other hand strong arguments",
    "exist in favour of a helium - rich composition , the most important ones being the generally higher densities in the highly transparent cool helium atmospheres , which would easily provide the extreme perturber densities evident in the line profile , and much shorter diffusion timescales in hydrogen atmospheres @xcite , making the presence of significant amounts of heavier elements practically impossible without a continuous source of enrichment .",
    "yet under these premises a helium - dominated atmosphere containing a smaller fraction of hydrogen - rich material could still provide a viable explanation of the observed spectra .",
    "@xcite have analysed an , albeit hotter , wd of such composition and found its combination of hydrogen lines with an unusually strong balmer decrement and ca , mg and fe lines best explained with the admixture of ca .",
    "10@xmath4 solar composition material to a helium atmosphere .",
    "such a model also obviates the need for removing the hydrogen from the accreted material e.g.  by means of the propeller mechanism @xcite .",
    "stellar atmosphere models were calculated using the ` phoenix ` code @xcite , in its static , 1d lte setup .",
    "formation of molecules in full chemical equilibrium is included by the equation of state of @xcite as described in @xcite , though in the white dwarf models chemistry is dominated by only a few hydrogen compounds .",
    "this eos does not take into account , on the other hand , non - ideal - gas effects relevant at extreme densities .",
    "but densities in the line formation region mostly do not exceed the limit of @xmath510@xmath6@xmath7 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : nahe21p7 ] ) , where a fluid - like state is approached and corrections for non - ideality must be included @xcite .",
    "profiles of the alkali metal resonance lines for perturbations due to neutral he and h@xmath0 are calculated as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the dipole moment within the adiabatic theory , as detailed in @xcite . in the ` phoenix ` implementation the line opacity is calculated by splitting the profile into a core component , which is describing the interactions at long distance with a lorentzian line shape , and the far wings for close interactions that can produce detunings up to several 1000 .",
    "the latter is computed in the low density limit using an expansion of the autocorrelation function in powers of density , which for the present models has been developed to the third order and evaluated at a perturber density of 10@xmath8@xmath7 .",
    "this method , successfully applied under the conditions of brown dwarf atmospheres , possibly compromises results at higher density ranges , where multiple perturber interactions become important even at close distances .",
    "figure [ fig : wd2356 ] shows the optical spectrum of wd2356@xmath2209 in comparison to three of our models . in all cases shown here ,",
    "the logarithmic ratio of he / h number densities is set to @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath51% hydrogen with a corresponding amount of heavy elements at solar - composition ratios added to the helium atmosphere .",
    "a comparison of the wd2356@xmath2209 spectrum with hydrogen / helium lte atmospheres is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : wd2356 ] .",
    "the strong dependence of the alkali lines on temperature , becoming quickly weaker with increasing @xmath9 , is evident .",
    "for these models the spectrum becomes increasingly difficult to reproduce at temperatures above 4000k , as the the width of the nai doublet would require unrealistically high na abundances , even up to the solar value .",
    "such high metallicities would also conflict with the observed limits on molecular bands such as mgh and cah and the ki doublet at 7700 , all of which should be seen quite clearly if a solar abundance pattern is assumed .     of he at 3000k , compared to the 7@xmath1 order expansion and lorentzian ]    [ fig : nahe21p7 ]      the synthetic spectra using line profiles calculated in the impact approximation , thus including multiple - perturber interactions and yielding a lorentzian lineshape , show that this simpler model can better reproduce the total strength and width of the nai line , though the shape appears very poorly matched .",
    "one might therefore suspect that the expansion of the autocorrelation function has to be extended to higher powers of density for a correct implementation of the unified profile .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : hehdens ] the perturber density in the line - forming region of an ultracool wd atmosphere can indeed exceed considerably the value of 10@xmath10 for which the present version of the far wing profiles was evaluated .",
    "this is confirmed by directly comparing the line strengths for higher densities",
    ". however figure [ fig : nahe21p7 ] shows that at a he density of 10@xmath11 even the 7@xmath1 order of the expansion falls short of the correct line strength in the wings at @xmath51002000 by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this plot also illustrates how the unified profile approaches the impact approximation close to the line core as discussed by @xcite . at larger separations ,",
    "i.e.  for closer interactions , the deviations become severe , though the latter model at most wavelengths still matches more closely the correct line strength than the density expansion , especially in the red wing . at a few 100 separation",
    "we find the third order expansion to underestimate the absorption by a factor of more than 10 , the 7@xmath1 order still by about 4 , but the lorentzian profile by only 1@xmath23 .",
    "we can thus appreciate why the latter produces relatively better agreement with the observation .",
    "to 10@xmath12 , all calculations at @xmath13@xmath143000k ]    [ fig : nahed2 ]    in figure [ fig : nahed2 ] we follow the further transformation of the line profile when proceeding to yet higher densities .",
    "ultimately a merging of the line core and the satellite to the blue of the original line position emerges , increasing the opacity around 5000 by another factor of 10 , while the red wing tends to asymptotically constant absorption which is actually fairly closely matched by the lorentz profile ( not shown ) . with these simulations we may now identify much , if not all , absorption shortward of the nai line centre with the blue wing of the resonance line itself . noting the sharp drop - off of opacity below 5000",
    "we can also expect that not much of the profile is formed at he densities above 2@xmath2@xmath15 .",
    "it is tempting to trace the local flux minimum near 5000 to the contribution of the satellite feature at higher layers , which is still well defined up to 10@xmath11 , but an unambiguous identification should require both a full model atmosphere calculation incorporating these high density line shapes and observations at higher @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude that wd2356@xmath2209 shows the effects of collisional damping at significantly higher perturber densities than encountered in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs .",
    "detailed modelling of this object pushes broadening theory to new limits and thus provides a more stringent test of our calculations .",
    "this should advance our understanding of the physical conditions in ultracool , compact objects in general , and improve atmosphere models for brown dwarfs and other low - mass objects as well .",
    "although these do not show such extreme broadening in the observable spectrum , the alkali lines provide significant opacity in the deeper layers of their atmospheres , thereby affecting the thermal structure at the convective boundary and possibly their cooling rate ( i.  baraffe , _ priv .",
    "study of ultracool white dwarfs like wd2356@xmath2209 or sdssj1330 + 6435 could thereby prove a test case for modelling the evolution of low - mass stars , brown dwarfs and giant planets ."
