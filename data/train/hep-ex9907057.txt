    "measurements of the charged track mutliplicity distribution in @xmath0 meson decay are used to constrain unmeasured or poorly measured branching fractions in monte carlo simulations so that generated event samples more closely represent actual data .",
    "the cleo monte carlo parameterization of @xmath0 meson decays has been tuned to agree with our measurements and our model is used by other experimental groups  @xcite .",
    "charged particle multiplicity in heavy meson decay has been studied by several groups  @xcite@xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a measurement of the charged particle multiplicity in inclusive @xmath6 decays that is an improvement over our previous result  @xcite .",
    "we also present improved measurements of the charged particle multiplicities in semileptonic and nonleptonic decays .",
    "for clarity , we use the term `` observed multiplicity '' to denote the number of well reconstructed charged particle tracks in a given event .",
    "we use the term `` decay multiplicity '' to denote the number of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 that come from the decay of the primary @xmath0 mesons and also from the subsequent decays of any secondary or tertiary particles other than neutrons , @xmath42 , or @xmath43 .",
    "the decay multiplicity excludes any tracks produced through interactions with the detector or surrounding material .",
    "not all charged decay products will result in reconstructed tracks , and not all observed tracks come from the primary decay , so the observed multiplicity may be less than , equal to , or greater than the decay multiplicity for a given event .",
    "the cleo detector is located at the cornell electron storage ring , a high luminosity @xmath44 collider operated at or near the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "the results presented here are derived from a sample of 1.4  fb@xmath45 , corresponding to @xmath2 @xmath0 meson pairs , collected with the cleo ii detector  @xcite .",
    "charged particle tracks are measured by cylindrical wire drift chambers inside a 1.5  t superconducting solenoid .",
    "a csi crystal calorimeter is also inside the magnet , and energy deposition information from both the calorimeter and the drift chamber is used for particle identification .",
    "muon counters are layered in the steel yoke surrounding the coil .    to obtain a clean sample of candidate @xmath6 events , we select hadronic events by requiring that an event have three or more reconstructed tracks , energy deposition in the calorimeter greater than 15% of the center of mass energy and an event vertex consistent with the interaction region . for additional background suppression , the total reconstructed event energy , including charged and neutral particles ,",
    "is required to be between 4  gev and 12  gev , and the total reconstructed vector momentum of the event is required to have a magnitude less than 3  gev/@xmath46 .",
    "this hadronic event sample contains events from both @xmath6 and continuum processes such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 production .",
    "we remove the continuum contribution by rescaling and subtracting the observed multiplicity distribution of a separate 0.7  fb@xmath45 data sample collected 65  mev/@xmath49 below the @xmath1 resonance .    to be counted in our observed multiplicity",
    ", drift chamber tracks are required to be well reconstructed and consistent with having originated from the event vertex .",
    "tracks must not be within 25.8  degrees of the @xmath44 beam axis .",
    "once the event selection , continuum subtraction , and track selection are completed , we count the selected tracks in each event to obtain the _ observed _ charged track multiplicity distribution in fig .",
    "there are events with fewer than three selected tracks because not all reconstructed tracks pass the track selection criteria .    to obtain the true decay multiplicity distribution from the observed multiplicity distribution , we must account for detector effects .",
    "if the number of events with observed multiplicity @xmath50 is @xmath51 and the number of events with decay multiplicity @xmath52 is @xmath53 , these quantities are related by eqn .",
    "[ e : migration ] .",
    "@xmath54    where @xmath55 is the probability that an event with decay multiplicity @xmath52 will be reconstructed with observed multiplicity @xmath50 .",
    "we have assumed that charge is conserved , so the index @xmath52 can only take even values . in principle , there can be events with decay multiplicity of zero , where two neutral @xmath0 mesons decay to all neutral final states .",
    "however , we do not include zero decay multiplicity events in our analysis both because of the very low branching ratio for such events and also because our event selection criteria make detection of such events extremely unlikely .",
    "the upper bound in eqn .",
    "[ e : migration ] is , in principle , the maximum decay multiplicity in a @xmath6 event , which is not known .",
    "we vary the maximum decay multiplicity in our analysis as described below .",
    "the fact that the sum of @xmath53 and the sum of @xmath51 are both equal to the total number of events is used to constrain the values of the @xmath53 , as expressed in eqn .",
    "[ e : constraint ] .    @xmath56    where the upper bound @xmath57 is the maximum value of our observed multipicity which is 20 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath55 in eqn .",
    "[ e : migration ] are obtained from monte carlo simulation and depend primarily on the detector s track finding efficiency and also on the probability of producing extra charged particles that pass the track selection cuts and that are counted .",
    "while these coefficients depend on accurate simulation of detector response and processes such as photon conversion and decays in flight , they do not depend significantly on the exact tuning of the branching fractions or the decay multiplicity distribution in the simulation .",
    "the parameters @xmath53 in eqn .",
    "[ e : migration ] are determined by a @xmath58 fit .",
    "this fit unfolds the detector effects to give the decay multiplicity distribution of events that pass the event selection criteria .",
    "these selection criteria are biased against very low decay multiplicity events , particularly because of the requirement of three or more reconstructed tracks .",
    "we remove the event selection bias using monte carlo simulation to determine the probability for events of a given decay multiplicity to pass the event selection cuts .",
    "after unfolding detector and reconstruction effects , we obtain the decay multiplicity distribution in fig .",
    "the error bars represent the statistical uncertainty in both the @xmath58 fit and the event bias correction , but do not include systematic errors .",
    "the dashed lines represent the high multiplicity and low multiplicity statistical fluctuations in the fit .",
    "the large error bar on the @xmath59 point is due to the event bias correction .    from the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we obtain a mean of @xmath60 charged particles for inclusive @xmath6 decay , where the error is statistical only . the points with @xmath61 show no evidence for events with such high multiplicities .",
    "we have tested our fitting procedure by varying the maximum decay multiplicity included in the fit between 20 and 28 .",
    "the fit is stable and the unfolded mean decay multiplicity does not change significantly when decay multiplicities of 22 and higher are included or excluded from the fit .    the most important systematic effect in this analysis is the accuracy of modeling the detector s track finding efficiency .",
    "our studies indicate that the overall efficiency for finding a single track is known to within @xmath62 for tracks with momentum greater than @xmath63  mev/@xmath46 and with decreasing accuracy as track momentum decreases .",
    "the uncertainty in single track finding efficiency gives a @xmath64 uncertainty in the measured mean decay multiplicity .",
    "removal of the event selection bias shifts the measured mean decay multiplicity by @xmath65 , which we also take as the systematic uncertainty for event selection bias . because the track finding efficiency depends on the momentum of the track , we account for the uncertainty due to this dependence .",
    "this analysis uses all tracks without regard to momentum .",
    "when we add a track selection cut requiring a reconstructed momentum of at least @xmath66  mev/@xmath46 , we observe a shift in the decay multiplicity of @xmath67 .",
    "we assign an additional @xmath68 uncertainty due to this momentum dependence .",
    "charged pions produced by the decays of @xmath69 will have lower track finding efficiency than average charged pions , so our result depends on the rate of @xmath69 production in our simulation .",
    "based on our studies of inclusive @xmath69 production in @xmath0 meson decay , we assign a systematic uncertainty of @xmath70 from this source .",
    "interactions of neutral and charged decay products with the detector material produce additional charged tracks , some of which satisfy the track selection criteria .",
    "we study the effect of these extra tracks by varying the rates of photon conversion and hadronic interactions in our monte carlo sample .",
    "misidentification of these extra tracks contributes an additional @xmath71 systematic uncertainty .",
    "extra tracks also come from the decay of particles in the detector volume , adding another @xmath72 uncertainty .",
    "additional uncertainty comes from contamination by non-@xmath6 events , most notably from beam - gas interactions .",
    "we study the effect of non-@xmath6 events by varying the size of the continuum subtraction by @xmath73 , which is the uncertainty in our measured luminosity , and we find a @xmath74 uncertainty in our mean decay multiplicity .",
    "we have looked for other potential systematic effects by varying our track selection cuts but do not observe any significant change in mean decay multiplicity .",
    "when all systematic errors are added in quadrature , we obtain a total systematic uncertainty of @xmath75 , which gives a final result of @xmath3 for the mean inclusive charged particle decay multiplicity in the decay of a @xmath6 pair .",
    "systematic errors are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the results presented here are a significant improvement over the previous cleo result  @xcite .",
    "the earlier analysis found a mean multiplicity of @xmath76 .",
    "in addition to using a much larger sample of @xmath6 events , the present analysis uses a substantially different method .",
    "the former analysis treated the coefficients @xmath55 in eqn .",
    "[ e : migration ] as a matrix and used matrix inversion to solve for the @xmath53 .",
    "such matrix inversion is very sensitive to singularities and can produce unstable results . in the current analysis , we do not attempt to invert the @xmath55 matrix , but instead we perform a more stable @xmath58 fit for the parameters @xmath53 .",
