    "the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation  @xcite describes a rich variety of processes such as surface growth  @xcite , directed polymers  @xcite , and avalanches  @xcite . and accordingly , the massive array of literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) , on the topic of kpz theory reflects the central role the kpz equation plays in the study of stochastic dynamic processes . the wide variety of dynamic processes governed by the kpz equation form the so - called kpz universality class  a class of seemingly unrelated dynamics whose bulk properties obey , on a course - grained level , this one master equation .",
    "one member of the kpz universality class , the well studied one - dimensional asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) describes a driven lattice gas with hard core exclusions  @xcite , and has also been applied to studies of highway traffic  @xcite , protein synthesis  @xcite , and sequence alignment  @xcite . characterizing the underlying properties of the asep promises a greater understanding for these specific studies as well as insights into the broader kpz universality class .",
    "not surprisingly , much effort has been spent calculating some of the many properties of the asep such as the density profile , steady states , mass gaps , and diffusion constants  @xcite .",
    "though many questions still remain , these myriad studies have helped to uncover a great deal of insight into the asep .    in their study of",
    "the asep , derrida and lebowitz  @xcite extended the bethe ansatz approach of gwa and spohn  @xcite in order to solve the totally asep for particle displacement in the asymptotic limit of large system size  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of their solution involves the scaling function @xmath2 , describing the non - linear behavior of the total particle flux .",
    "the derrida - lebowitz scaling function ( dlsf ) is independent of any model parameters .",
    "thus , this scaling function was conjectured to be _ universal _ ,",
    "i.e. , characteristic of all kpz systems . in a follow - up study , derrida and appert analytically continued the derrida - lebowitz scaling function ( dlsf ) , successfully completing the solution for all space in the asymptotic limit of large system sizes  @xcite . since then , a large number of studies have given strong evidence for the universality of the dlsf .",
    "these studies fall into two classes . on the one hand , for a few closely related variants of the continuous time",
    "totally asep  @xcite the characteristic dlsf behavior has been analytically verified . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical studies have bolstered the universality claim of the dlsf  @xcite for a much broader range of systems including genuinely _ discrete _ time systems .",
    "however , these numerical methods do not directly verify the universality of the dlsf , but rather verify the universality of certain cumulant ratios which must be universal if the dlsf is universal  @xcite .",
    "these numerical approaches can not directly verify the dlsf since they use _ sampling _ methods that are inherently unable to probe the full dlsf which contains information about _ statistically rare _ events .",
    "in addition to that , both analytical and numerical studies rely on examining the behavior of the so - called scaling region  @xcite which applies only in the limit of very large system sizes ( @xmath3 ) , especially in the discrete time case ( @xmath4 ) .    by examining properties applicable to the intermediate scaling region",
    ", we created a method for _ directly _ measuring the dlsf for discrete time systems of considerably smaller size ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "our method works without resorting to the stochastic sampling that makes cumulant methods so time consuming . as an application ,",
    "we show that the discrete time asep with both single and multiple particles per site under any parameter choice is characterized by the same dlsf conjectured to be universal for all processes within the kpz universality class .",
    "our method can also be used to study the particle hopping in other asep scenarios , including the open boundary asep .",
    "once dlsf behavior has been verified for any given system , our method also provides a way to numerically calculate the non - universal scaling constants that , together with the known form of the dlsf , can be used to calculate properties such as the particle hopping distribution or the large deviation function .",
    "this paper will begin with a short review of the continuous time single particle system from which derrida _ et al . _",
    "@xcite initially derived the dlsf in section  [ sec : review ] .",
    "then , we will reveal a small extension of the derrida _",

    "this agreement is essentially due to the fact that @xmath36 provides an approximation the @xmath16 behavior that is far superior to the linear approximation from which the derrida - lebowitz scaling function @xmath2 was originally derived .",
    "it is instructive to verify that our new relation eq .",

    "it is known  @xcite that @xmath37 where the sub - leading terms decay exponentially with @xmath38 . since this leading term in @xmath2 cancels with the second term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ eq : lambdaneg ] ) emerges . if on the other hand @xmath21 is held constant as @xmath20 , @xmath27 vanishes .",

    "<S> in the universality class of the one dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang surface growth , derrida and lebowitz conjectured the universality of not only the scaling exponents , but of an entire scaling function . since derrida and lebowitz s original publication  [ prl * 80 * 209 ( 1998 ) ] </S>",
    "<S> this universality has been verified for a variety of continuous time , periodic boundary systems in the kpz universality class . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a numerical method for directly examining the entire particle flux of the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) , thus providing an alternative to more difficult cumulant ratios studies . using this method </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the derrida - lebowitz scaling function ( dlsf ) properly characterizes the large system size limit ( @xmath0 ) of a single particle discrete time system , even in the case of very small system sizes ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact allows us to not only verify that the dlsf properly characterizes multiple particle discrete - time asymmetric exclusion processes , but also provides a way to numerically solve for quantities of interest , such as the particle hopping flux . </S>",
    "<S> this method can thus serve to further increase the ease and accessibility of studies involving even more challenging dynamics , such as the open boundary asep . </S>"
