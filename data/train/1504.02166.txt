    "two powerful perspectives have helped clarify the nature of wave propagation in open random systems .",
    "one of them , relates to the leakage of waves through the boundaries of the system and can be described in terms of quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) , which are the extension to open structures of the notion of normal modes in closed systems @xcite .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of the qnms are complex , with imaginary parts that are the inverses of the lifetimes of the qnms .",
    "the second perspective is that of transmission through random systems @xcite . for multichannel samples ,",
    "transmission is most conveniently described in terms of the transmission matrix , @xmath5 , whose elements are field transmission coefficients @xcite .",
    "the transmittance is the sum of eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix @xmath6 .",
    "some of these eigenvalues are close to unity even in weakly - transmitting samples @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the transmission matrix makes it possible to manipulate the incident wavefront to enhance or suppress total transmission through random media @xcite and to focus transmitted radiation at selected points @xcite .",
    "the control over transmitted radiation can be exploited to improve images washed out by random scattering and to facilitate the detection and location of objects @xcite .",
    "the great potential of such algorithms for a host of practical applications has recently attracted attention in both the physics @xcite and mathematics communities @xcite and references therein .    in open regular homogeneous systems ( e.g. single quantum potential wells , optical cavities , or microwave resonators ) each peak in transmission , or transmission resonance ( tr ) ,",
    "is associated with a qnm ( @xcite and references therein ) , so that the resonant frequency is close to the real part of the corresponding eigenvalue . however",
    ", despite extensive research and much recent progress the connection between qnms and trs in disordered open systems still requires a better physical understanding and mathematical justification ,    to this end , it is instructive to look for insights in 1d systems .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the transmission of a long enough 1d disordered system is typically exponentially small . at the same time",
    ", there exists a set of frequencies at which the transmission coefficient has a local maximum ( peak in transmission ) , and some of these are close to unity @xcite . in 1d , each peak is associated with an eigenstate which is a solution of the wave equation with outgoing boundary conditions ( a pole of the s - matrix ) .",
    "quite surprisingly , much less are studied the properties of qnms in 1d systems with weak disorder where the localization length is smaller than the size of the sample . in this paper",
    "we show for the first time that in completely open one - dimensional disordered systems , two different types of qnms can exist : ordinary qnms , associated with resonant transmission peaks and hidden qnms unrelated to any maxima in the transmission spectrum .",
    "the hidden modes exist due to random scattering and arise as soon as an arbitrarily small disorder is introduced",
    ". the imaginary parts of the eigenfrequencies of hidden qnms vary with increasing disorder in an unusual manner .",
    "typically , stronger disorder leads to stronger localization of modes with eigenfrequencies that approach the real axis .",
    "however , the imaginary part of a hidden mode@xmath7s eigenfrequency , depending on the boundary conditions , either is independent of strength of random scattering or even increases from the onset of disorder .",
    "surprisingly , the average ratio of the number of ordinary modes to the total number of qnms in a given frequency interval is independent of the type of disorder and remains close to the constant @xmath3 over wide ranges of the strength of disorder and of the total length of the system .",
    "the value @xmath3 follows from the general statistical properties of random trigonometric polynomials @xcite . as the scattering strength and/or the length of the system increase , hidden",
    "qnms eventually become ordinary .",
    "the situation is different in multi - channel random systems in which a genuine diffusive regime exists .",
    "the degree of spectral overlap is expressed in the thouless number , @xmath8 , which gives the ratio of the typical width @xmath9 and spacing @xmath10 of qnms , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the typical linewidth @xmath9 is essentially equal to the field correlation frequency over which there is typically a single peak in the transmission spectrum .",
    "the density of peaks is therefore @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse level spacing @xmath13 is equal to the density of states ( dos ) of the medium .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath2 can be expected to be close to @xmath14 for diffusive waves .",
    "the localization threshold lies at @xmath15 @xcite ; @xmath8 may be much larger than 1 for diffusive waves so that @xmath16 and may be small .",
    "for localized waves , the number of channels that contribute effectively to transmission , @xmath4 , approached unity and transport becomes effectively one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "for example , the statistics of transmittance are then in accord with the single parameter scaling hypothesis @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that although the statistics of the eigenstates of disordered systems is a subject of intensive investigations for already more that two decades ( see , for example @xcite ) , the statistics of the transmission resonances ( peaks in transmission spectra ) is much less studied .",
    "the comparison of these two is a challenging problem for future investigations .",
    "here we find that a connection can be made between the present 1d calculations of @xmath2 and measurements in multichannel diffusive systems .",
    "this is done by comparing ratio of @xmath0 to the number of qnms divided by @xmath4 , @xmath17 in multichannel systems to the ratio @xmath2 in 1d , where @xmath18 .",
    "we first consider a generic 1d system composed of @xmath19 scatterers separated by @xmath20 intervals and attached to two semi - infinite leads .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath21 are solutions of the wave equation satisfying the outgoing boundary conditions , which means that there are no right / left - propagating waves in the left / right lead .",
    "each eigenfunction is a superposition of two counter - propagating monochromatic waves @xmath22 .",
    "the eigenfunction in the @xmath23th layer , @xmath24 , is equal to @xmath25 , and the amplitudes @xmath26 in adjacent layers are connected by a transfer matrix .",
    "the wave numbers @xmath27 are complex - valued and form the discrete set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , so that the frequencies @xmath30 these eigenfunctions are qnms .",
    "note that all distances hereafter are measured in optical lengths .    in what follows ,",
    "the scatterers and the distances between them are characterized by the reflection coefficients @xmath31 and thicknesses @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the random values @xmath33 and @xmath34 are distributed in certain intervals , and @xmath35 . the last condition means that the length @xmath36 of the sample is equal to @xmath37 .    to explicitly introduce a variable strength @xmath38 of disorder",
    ", we replace all reflection coefficients by @xmath39 , and assume ( unless otherwise specified ) that the coefficients @xmath40 are homogeneously distributed in the interval @xmath41 .",
    "this enables to keep track of the evolution of the qnm eigenvalues @xmath42 as the disorder increases .",
    "the condition @xmath43 ensures that any random realization with the same @xmath20 contains the same number of qnms @xmath44 in a given interval @xmath45 of the wavenumbers .    at the beginning , let us consider the qnms of a regular resonator of the length @xmath46 assuming that all reflection coefficients except @xmath47 and @xmath48 are equal to zero . in this case",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the qnm eigenvalues @xmath42 are @xmath49 where @xmath50    in what follows , instead of the intensity of the @xmath51th mode , @xmath52 , we consider the quantity @xmath53 , which is @xmath54 averaged over fast oscillations caused by the interference of the left- and right - propagating waves . examples of these functions for resonators are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0]a , b .",
    "there @xmath55 is distributed along the system as @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57/2 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath58 , the minimum of the intensity is located at the center of the system , and in an asymmetric case shifts to the boundary with higher reflection coefficient .",
    "this property will be used when analyzing the properties of the qnms of the disordered system .    in a disordered sample ,",
    "the reflection coefficients @xmath59 are random and scaled by the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the evolution of the eigenvalues @xmath60 as the parameter @xmath38 grows shows that qnms separate into two essentially different types .",
    "there are ordinary qnms whose lifetimes , defined by the value of @xmath61 , increase monotonically with @xmath38 .",
    "simultaneously , there are `` hidden '' qnms ( the origin of this term will be explained in the next section ) , whose lifetimes are substantially smaller than the lifetimes of ordinary qnms and remain constant when @xmath38 varies over many orders of magnitude .",
    "figures [ figaa ] and [ figb ] show trajectories of the qnms eigenvalues @xmath62 as the parameter @xmath38 grows , and dependencies @xmath63 .",
    "our numerical calculations show that when external reflectors are added at the edges of the sample , the imaginary parts of some of the hidden modes increase with the strength of disorder .",
    "the spatial distributions of the intensity @xmath64 along the system are also different for ordinary and hidden qnms . the evolution of @xmath64 as the strength of the disorder @xmath38 grows is shown in fig",
    ".  [ fnew1 ] .    initially ,",
    "when @xmath38 is so small that values of @xmath65 are almost equal for both types of modes , the distributions @xmath64 are practically identical and evolve in the same manner : the minimum is placed near the center of the sample , and slopes ( which are @xmath65 ) decrease as the disorder strength @xmath38 grows ( see fig .",
    "[ fnew1 ] ) .",
    "these distributions are similar to the distribution of the intensity in the regular resonator with a small imbalance between the reflection coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the resonator walls .",
    "when @xmath63 of the hidden mode `` @xmath68 '' reaches its plateau ( see fig .   [ figb ] ) , the minimum of its distribution shifts from the center , as in the resonator with strong imbalance between the reflection coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the slope of the distribution of hidden modes remains constant ( @xmath65 is independent of @xmath38 on the plateau ) , whereas the slopes of all ordinary modes are equal and continue to decrease as the parameter @xmath38 grows .",
    "the difference between the distributions of ordinary and hidden qnms is that the ordinary modes are concentrated near both edges of the system , while the hidden mode is nestled at one edge .",
    "it is important to stress that this separation of the qnms into two types occurs when the disorder strength @xmath38 is small so that the localization length @xmath69 is large relative to the system length @xmath36 , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , this phenomenon is not related to anderson localization , but , as it will be shown below , manifests itself also when @xmath71 .    notwithstanding that at @xmath72 , the lifetimes of all hidden modes increase , these modes are much more resistant to disorder : they become localized at far stronger disorder than ordinary states .",
    "as can be seen , for example , in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , at @xmath73 , when @xmath74 , the difference between the imaginary parts of ordinary and some of hidden qnms is about of one order of magnitude .",
    "we now consider the transmission of an incident wave through the system .",
    "the wavenumbers at which the transmission coefficient reaches its local maximum and the corresponding fields inside the system are transmission resonances ( tr ) . the qnms and trs are interrelated . in what follows",
    ", we explore the relation between qnms and trs , in particular , study the differences between the spectra of trs and qnms .",
    "it is easy to show that in a resonator , the wave numbers @xmath75 of the transmission resonances coincide with the real parts @xmath76 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and there is a one - to - one correspondence between qnms and trs so that the number of resonances @xmath77 is equal to the number of qnms , @xmath78 , in a given frequency interval .",
    "the same relation also exists in periodic systems ( periodic sets @xmath40 and @xmath79 ) @xcite .    in disordered systems ,",
    "the relation between qnms and trs is quite different .",
    "while each tr has its partner among the qnms , the reverse is not true : there are hidden qnms that are not associated with any maximum in transmission as shown in figs .",
    "[ qm_tr ] and [ qm_tr_s ]    figure  [ figintro ] illustrates another fundamental difference between the ordinary and hidden qnms .",
    "the ordinary qnms whose real parts of the complex - valued eigenfrequency , @xmath80 lie in a given frequency interval , can be determined from the transmittance spectrum @xmath81 of 1d disordered samples , because each peak in the spectrum corresponds to a frequency whose value @xmath82 practically coincides with @xmath80 . moreover , when disorder is strong enough , so that @xmath83 , the distribution of the transmitted wave intensity along the sample reconstructs very closely the shape of the intensity of ordinary qnm eigenfunctions .",
    "in contrast , a hidden qnm is invisible ( this explains the origin of the term `` hidden '' ) in the transmittance spectrum and its intensity distribution is indistinguishable from that at a non - resonant frequency",
    ".    note that although the hidden modes are not displayed in the amplitude of the transmission coefficient , they are manifested in the phase of the transmission coefficient .",
    "the density of states at a frequency @xmath84 is proportional to the derivative with respect to frequency of the phase of the complex transmission coefficient @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations show that each hidden mode adds @xmath85 to the total phase shift of the transmission coefficient exactly in the same way as ordinary qnms .",
    "the evolution of a hidden qnm as the degree of disorder grows is analogous to the evolution of a mode in a regular resonator when one of its edges becomes less transparent .",
    "this means that a hidden mode may be transformed into an ordinary ( i.e. , made visible in the transmission ) by increasing the reflectivity of the corresponding edge of the sample , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] .",
    "the sample , whose transmission spectrum is shown in fig .  [ qm_tr ] , contains three hidden qnms ( # 1,5 , and 6 ) in the given spectral range .",
    "distributions of the intensity @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the layer number ) for qnms # 1 and 6 are similar to the distributions in resonators with right reflection coefficient @xmath67 smaller than the left reflection coefficient @xmath66 , @xmath88 .",
    "the intensity distribution of qnm # 5 is characterized by the opposite inequality @xmath89 . when the value of the right - end reflection coefficient is increased , new resonances appear in transmission for the initially hidden modes # 1 and 6 , while mode # 5 remains hidden ( fig .",
    "[ fig4a]a ) .",
    "in contrast , increasing the left - end reflection coefficient transforms qnm # 5 into a ordinary mode , whereas qnms # 1 and 6 remain hidden in the transmission spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig4a]b ) .",
    "important to stress that the separation of qnms into two types , ordinary and hidden , occurs already at a very small disorder strength , @xmath90 , when the localization length is larger than the sample length , @xmath70 .",
    "the ensemble - averaged of the ratio of the number of transmission resonances , @xmath77 , which is the number of ordinary modes , to the total number of qnms , @xmath78 , has been calculated numerically for a variety of randomly layered samples with different types of disorder ( random reflection coefficients of the layers , @xmath40 , and/or random thicknesses @xmath79 , with rectangular and gaussian distribution functions ) in broad ranges of the disorder strength @xmath38 and of the length of the realizations @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig7a ] shows the average of @xmath91 over @xmath92 random realizations as a function of the ensemble - averaged transmission coefficient @xmath93 [ panel ( a ) ] , and as a function of ratio of @xmath20 to the localization length @xmath94 ( measured in numbers of layers ) , @xmath95 [ panel ( b ) ] for samples with @xmath96 , and @xmath97 layers . at this scaling ,",
    "all functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 for samples of different lengths merge in a single curve .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7a ] that the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath78 appears when @xmath100 , and the ratio @xmath91 varies weakly even when @xmath101 . moreover , independently of the samples parameters , the average ratio @xmath91 tends to the constant @xmath3 when @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the existence of hidden modes and the universality of their relative number is a general feature of 1d disordered systems not specifically related to localization .",
    "it is of interest to explore the ratio of the numbers of local maxima in transmission and qnms in random _ multichannel _ systems and to compare to results for 1d systems .",
    "we consider quasi - one dimensional ( quasi-1d ) samples with reflecting sides and transverse dimensions @xmath103 much smaller than the sample length @xmath36 and localization length @xmath104 , @xmath105 . here , @xmath106 is the number of channels or freely - propagating transverse modes in the perfectly conducting leads or empty waveguide leading to the sample and @xmath107 is the transport mean free path .",
    "the incident channels are thoroughly mixed by scattering within the sample .",
    "in contrast to transmission in 1d samples with a single transmission channel , transmission through quasi-1d samples is described by the field transmission matrix @xmath5 with elements @xmath108 between all @xmath106 incident and outgoing channels , @xmath68 and @xmath109 , respectively . from the transmission matrix",
    ", we may distinguish three types of transmission variables in quasi-1d samples : the intensity @xmath110 , the total transmission , @xmath111 , and transmittance , @xmath112 .",
    "the transmittance is analogous to the electronic conductance in units of the quantum of conductance @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the ensemble average value of the transmittance @xmath114 is equal to the dimensionless conductance , @xmath115 , which characterizes the crossover from diffusive to localized waves . in diffusive samples , the dimensionless conductance is equal to the thouless number , @xmath116 and the localization threshold is reached when @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "significant differences between results in 1d and quasi-1d geometries can be expected since propagation can be diffusive in quasi-1d samples with length greater than the mean free path but smaller than the localization length , @xmath118 , whereas a diffusive regime does not exist in 1d since @xmath119 @xcite . for diffusive waves ,",
    "qnms overlap spectrally and may coalesce into a single peak in the transmittance spectrum .",
    "thus we might expect that the qnms within a typical linewidth form a single peak in transmission so that the ratio @xmath2 is the ratio of the mode spacing to the mode linewidth .",
    "the mode linewidth is related to the correlation frequency in the transmission spectra , but the mode spacing can not be readily ascertained once modes overlap .",
    "the transmittance can also be expressed as @xmath120 , where the @xmath121 are the eigenvalues of the matrix product @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the transmission matrix provides a basis for comparison between results for 1d and quasi-1d , which is often more direct than a comparison based on qnms , since the statistics of the contribution of different modes to transmission is not well - established , whereas the contribution of different channels is simply the sum of the transmission eigenvalues .",
    "in addition , transmission eigenchannels are orthogonal , whereas the waveform in transmission for spectrally - adjacent modes are strongly correlated @xcite so that the transmission involves interference between modes .",
    "the transmission eigenvalue may be obtained from the singular value decomposition of the transmission matrix , @xmath123 @xcite . here ,",

    "only a fraction of the @xmath106 eigenchannels contribute appreciably to the transmission @xcite . in diffusive samples ,",
    "the transmission is dominated by @xmath130 channels with @xmath131 @xcite , while a single eigenchannel dominates transmission for localized samples .",

    "the model introduced in the previous section can be used to study the segregation of superradiant states and trapped modes in regular quantum - mechanical and wave structures and to illuminate the analogy between this phenomenon and existence of two types of qnms ( hidden and ordinary ) in disordered systems considered above .",
    "behavior of modes in regular open structures as the coupling to an environment is altered , has been intensively studied in condensed matter physics , optics , and nuclear , atomic , and microwave physics .",
    "common to all these studies is the appearance of two time scales when the coupling to the environment via open decay channels increases and qnms begin to overlap @xcite ; for a review , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "when the coupling to the environment is weak , the lifetimes of all states tend to decrease as the coupling increases .",
    "as the coupling reaches a critical value , a restructuring of the spectrum of qnms occurs leading to segregation of the imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues and of the decay widths .",
    "the states separate into short - lived ( superradiant ) and long - lived ( trapped ) states .",
    "this phenomenon is general and , by analogy to quantum optics @xcite and atomic physics @xcite , is known as the superradiance transition . in more complicated structures , such of those consisting of two coupled oscillating subsystems , one with a low and the other with a much higher density of states , the superradiance transition is closely related to the existence of doorway states @xcite that strongly couple to short - lived qnms with external decay channels .",
    "it is important to stress that along with the pronounced similarities between the resonance trapping in many - particle quantum systems , open microwave cavities , etc . , and between the `` hidding '' of some of quasi - normal modes in disordered samples there are substantial differences as well .",
    "in particular , resonance trapping happens in regular systems considered in @xcite when the coupling of the large number of qnms to a much smaller number of common decay channels increases . without disorder , the samples that we consider are perfectly coupled to the environment ( total transmission at all frequencies ) .",
    "finite coupling appears due to disorder , as the result of the interference of multiply - scattered random fields , and the role of the coupling parameter is played by the strength of the scattering inside the system .    to reproduce the superradince phenomena in disordered structures we modify the model slightly by placing the random sample between two reflectors with reflection coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 , located at distances @xmath265 and @xmath266 from the edge scatterers . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath267 . these reflectors can be included in the dispersion equation eq .",

    "[ figk ]    when @xmath277 , the trajectories of the eigenvalues in the complex plane are more complicate .",

    "( [ eqzz ] ) @xmath284 tends to infinity , when even one of the reflection coefficients @xmath279 .",
    "the reason why these solutions `` run away '' when the coupling to the environment is maximal , is very simple .",
    "the original system without end reflectors has @xmath285 eigenmodes in the given interval @xmath45 , whereas the same system surrounded by the reflectors has @xmath286 eigenmodes in the same interval .",
    "thus , some of modes should leave this interval @xmath45 when the system returns to its original state .    .",
    "[ figl ]    the superradiant transition in periodic and disordered quantum system , which consist of a sets of potential wells , was studied in @xcite using effective hamiltonian approach .",
    "it was shown that the transition occurs when the coefficient @xmath287 , which characterizes the coupling with an environment , reaches the value of the coupling @xmath288 between the wells , @xmath289 . in",
    "the considered above system @xmath290 and @xmath291 , so that the superradiant transition occurs when @xmath292 .",

    "this result agrees with @xcite , where this value was estimated as @xmath294 , and @xmath295 is the fraction of the modes which are superradiant .",
    "note , that the original disordered sample is already coupled to the environment , so that the coupling strength is limited by the intrinsic properties of the sample and can not exceed this value , even when the end reflectors are fully transparent .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the relationship between spectra of quasi - normal modes and transmission resonances in open 1d and quasi-1d systems .",
    "we start from homogeneous samples , in which each tr is associated with a qnm , and vice versa .",
    "as soon as an arbitrarily weak disorder is introduced , this correspondence breaks down : a fraction of the eigenstates becomes hidden , in the sense that the corresponding resonances in transmission disappear .",
    "the evolution of the imaginary parts of the eigenfrequencies of the hidden qnms with changing disorder is also rather unusual . whereas increasing disorder leads to stronger localization of ordinary modes",
    "so that their eigenfrequencies approach the real axis , the imaginary parts of the eigenfrequency of hidden modes changes very slowly ( and may even increase when external reflectors are added to the edges ) with increasing disorder , and begin to go down only when the disorder becomes strong enough . for weak disorder ,",
    "the averaged ratio of the number of transmission peaks to the total number of qnms in a given frequency interval is independent of the type of disorder and deviates only slightly from a constant , @xmath3 , as the strength of disorder and/or the length of the random sample increase over a wide range .",
    "this constant coincides with the value of the ratio @xmath91 analytically calculated in the weak single - scattering approximation . as the strength @xmath38 of disorder keeps growing ,",
    "ultimately all hidden quasimodes become ordinary .",
    "this means that in 1d random systems there exists a pre - localized regime , in which only a fraction of the qnms are long - lived and provide resonant transmission . if the coupling to the environment is tuned by external edge reflectors , the superradiace transition can be reproduced . in quasi-1d samples , a genuine diffusive regime exists in which some qnms coalesce to form a single peak in transmission with width comparable to the typical modal linewidth . in such samples , hidden modes have been discovered experimentally and their proportion of all qnms in the crossover from diffusion to localization was fairly close to the same constant .",
    "the number of peaks in spectra of transmission , as well as in total transmission and in transmittance are nearly the same and fall well below the number of qnms .",
    "though the ratio @xmath91 may be small , we find in microwave experiments and numerical simulations that once the number of qnms is divided by the effective number of channels contributing to transmission to give @xmath296 , this function is similar to results in 1d samples .",
