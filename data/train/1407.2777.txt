    "classical graphs @xcite are closely related to quantum error correcting codes ( qeccs ) @xcite . the first construction of qeccs based upon the use of graphs and finite abelian groups appears in @xcite and is provided by schlingemann and werner ( sw - work )",
    "however , while in @xcite it is proved that all codes constructed from graphs are stabilizer codes , it remains unclear how to embed the usual stabilizer code constructions into the proposed graphical scheme .",
    "therefore , although necessary and sufficient conditions are uncovered for the graph such that the resulting code corrects a certain number of errors , the power of the graphical approach to quantum coding for stabilizer codes can not be fully exploited unless this embedding issue is resolved . in @xcite , schlingemann ( s - work ) clarifies this issue by establishing that each quantum stabilizer code ( both binary and nonbinary ) could be realized as a graph code and vice - versa . almost at the same time , inspired by the work presented in @xcite , the equivalence of graphical quantum codes and stabilizer codes is also established by grassl et _ al_. in @xcite . despite being very important , the works in @xcite and @xcite",
    "still suffer from the fact that no systematic scheme for constructing a graph of a stabilizer code or the stabilizer of a graphical quantum code is available .",
    "the solution of this point is especially important in view of the fact that although  any stabilizer code over a finite field has an equivalent representation as a graphical quantum code , unfortunately , this representation is not unique .",
    "furthermore , the chosen representation does not reflect all the properties of the quantum code . a crucial step forward for the description and understanding of the interplay between properties of graphs and stabilizer codes",
    "is achieved thanks to the introduction of the notion of graph states ( and cluster states , @xcite ) into the graphical construction of qeccs as presented by hein et _ al_. in @xcite . in this last work ,",
    "it is shown how graph states are in correspondence to graphs and special focus is devoted to the question of how the entanglement in a graph state is related to the topology of its underlying graph . in @xcite , it is also pointed out that codewords of various qeccs could be regarded as special instances of graph states and criteria for the equivalence of graph states under local unitary transformations entirely on the level of the underlying graphs are presented .",
    "similar findings are uncovered by van den nest et _ al_. in @xcite ( vdn - work ) where a constructive scheme showing that each stabilizer state is equivalent to a graph state under local clifford operations is discussed .",
    "thus , the main finding of schlingemann in @xcite is re - obtained in @xcite for the special case of binary quantum states .",
    "most importantly , in @xcite , an algorithmic procedure for transforming any binary quantum stabilizer code into a graph code appears .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , nobody has fully and jointly exploited the results provided by either schlingemann in @xcite or van den nest et _ al_. in @xcite to provide a more systematic procedure for constructing graphs associated with arbitrary binary stabilizer codes with special emphasis on the verification of their error - correcting capabilities .",
    "we emphasize that this last point constitutes one of the original motivations for introducing the concept of a graph into quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite .",
    "the cws quantum code formalism presents a unifying approach for constructing both additive and nonadditive qeccs , for both binary @xcite ( cws - work ) and nonbinary states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , every cws code in its canonical form can be fully characterized by a graph and a classical code . in particular ,",
    "any cws code is locally clifford equivalent to a cws code with a graph state stabilizer and word operators consistent only of @xmath0s @xcite .",
    "since the notion of stabilizer codes , graph codes and graph states can be recast into the cws formalism , it seems natural to investigate the graphical depiction of stabilizer codes as originally thought by schlingemann and werner within this generalized framework where stabilizer codes are realized as cws  codes . proceeding along this line of investigation",
    ", we shall observe that the notion of graph state in qec as presented in @xcite emerges naturally .",
    "furthermore , the algorithmic procedure for transforming any ( binary ) quantum stabilizer code into a graph code advocated in @xcite can be exploited and jointly used with the results in @xcite where the notions of both coincidence and adjacency matrices of a classical graphs are introduced . for the sake of completeness , we point out that the cws formalism has been already employed into the literature for the graphical construction of both binary @xcite and nonbinary @xcite ( both additive / stabilizer and nonadditive ) qeccs .",
    "for instance in @xcite , regarding stabilizer codes as cws codes and employing a graphical approach to quantum coding , a classification of all the extremal stabilizer codes up to eight qubits and the construction of the optimal @xmath1 code together with a family of @xmath2-error detecting nonadditive codes with the highest encoding rate so far is presented . with a leap of imagination , in @xcite",
    "it is also envisioned a graphical quantum computation based directly on graphical objects .",
    "indeed , this vision became recently more realistic in the work of beigi et _",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "being essentially within the cws framework , a systematic method for constructing both binary and nonbinary concatenated quantum codes based on graph concatenation is developed .",
    "graphs representing the inner and the outer codes are concatenated via a simple graph operation ( the so - called generalized local complementation , @xcite ) . despite their very illuminating findings , in @xcite",
    "it is emphasized that the elusive role played by graphs in qec is still not well - understood . in neither @xcite nor @xcite ,",
    "the authors are concerned with the joint exploitation of the results provided by either van den nest et _ al . _ in @xcite ( algorithmic procedure for transforming any binary quantum stabilizer code into a graph code ) or schlingemann in @xcite ( use of both the coincidence and adjacency matrices of a classical graphs in qec ) in order to provide a more systematic procedure for constructing graphs associated with arbitrary binary stabilizer codes with special emphasis on the verification of their error correcting capabilities which , as pointed out earlier , constituted a major driving motivation for the introduction of graphs in qec @xcite .",
    "instead , we aim here at investigating such unexplored topics and hope to further advance our understanding of the role played by classical graphs in quantum coding .    in this article , we propose a systematic scheme for the construction of graphs with both input and output vertices associated with arbitrary binary stabilizer codes .",
    "the scheme is characterized by three main steps : first , the stabilizer code is realized as a cws quantum code ; second , the canonical form of the cws  code is uncovered ; third , the input vertices are attached to the graphs with only output vertices . to check the effectiveness of the scheme ,",
    "we discuss several graphical constructions of various useful stabilizer codes characterized by single and multi - qubit encoding operators .",
    "in particular , the error - correcting capabilities of such quantum codes are verified in graph - theoretic terms as originally advocated by schlingemann and werner . finally , possible generalizations of our scheme for the graphical construction of both ( stabilizer and nonadditive ) nonbinary and continuous variables quantum codes is briefly addressed .",
    "the layout of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce some preliminary material . first , the notions of graphs , graph states and graph codes are presented .",
    "second , local clifford transformations on graph states and local complementations on graphs are briefly described .",
    "third , the cws quantum codes formalism is briefly explained . in section iii , we re - examine some basic ingredients of the schlingemann - werner work ( sw - work , @xcite ) , the schlingemann work ( s - work , @xcite ) and , finally , the van den nest et al .",
    "work ( vdn - work , @xcite ) .",
    "we focus on those aspects of these works that are especially important for our systematic scheme . in this section iv",
    ", we formally describe our scheme and , for the sake of clarity , apply it to the graphical construction of the leung et al .",
    "four - qubit quantum code for the error correction of single amplitude damping errors @xcite .",
    "finally , concluding remarks and a brief discussion on possible extensions of our schematic graphical construction to both ( stabilizer and nonadditive ) nonbinary and continuous variables quantum codes appear in section v.    several explicit constructions of graphs for various stabilizer codes characterized by either single or multi - qubit encoding operators are worked out in the appendices .",
    "specifically , we discuss the graphical construction of the following quantum codes :  the three - qubit repetition code , the perfect * * @xmath2-erasure correcting four - qubit code , the perfect * * @xmath2-error correcting five - qubit code , * * @xmath2-error correcting six - qubit quantum degenerate codes , the css seven - qubit stabilizer code , the shor nine - qubit stabilizer code , the gottesman @xmath3-error correcting eleven - qubit code , * * @xmath4   \\right ] $ ] * *  * * stabilizer codes , and , finally , the gottesman @xmath5",

    "an edge between two vertices represents the physical interaction between the corresponding systems . in what follows",
    ", we shall take into consideration simple graphs only .",
    "these are graphs that contain neither loops ( edges connecting vertices with itself ) nor multiple edges .",
    "furthermore , for the time being , we do not make a distinction between different types of vertices .",

    "graph states @xcite are multipartite entangled states that play a key - role in graphical constructions of qeccs codes and , in addition , are very important in quantum secret sharing @xcite which is , to a certain extent , equivalent to error correction @xcite . for a very recent experimental demonstration of a graph state quantum error correcting code",

    "these states are regarded as codewords , although we recall that what is significant from the point of view of the qec properties is the subspace they span , not the codewords themselves @xcite .",
    "the clifford group @xmath56 is the normalizer of the pauli group @xmath57 in @xmath58 , i.e. , it is the group of unitary operators @xmath59 satisfying @xmath60 . the local clifford group @xmath61 is the subgroup of @xmath56 and consists of all @xmath8-fold tensor products of elements in @xmath62 .",
    "the clifford group is generated by a simple set of quantum gates : the hadamard gate @xmath63 , the phase gate @xmath64 and the cnot gate @xmath65 @xcite . using the well - known representations of the pauli matrices in the computational basis ,",

    "as pointed out earlier , unitary operations @xmath59 in the local clifford group @xmath61 act on graph states @xmath37 .",

    "in this article , we proposed a systematic scheme for the construction of graphs * * with both input and output vertices associated with arbitrary binary stabilizer codes .",

    ", we discussed several graphical constructions of various useful stabilizer codes characterized by single and multi - qubit encoding operators ( for details , see appendices ) .",
    "in particular , the error correction capabilities of such quantum codes are verified in graph - theoretic terms as originally advocated by schlingemann and werner ( for details , see appendices ) .    finally , in what follows , possible generalizations of our scheme for the graphical construction of both ( stabilizer and nonadditive ) nonbinary and continuous - variable quantum codes will be briefly addressed .",
    "the scheme proposed is limited to binary stabilizer codes .",
    "how about nonbinary and continuous - variable ( cv ) codes ?",
    "how about nonadditive codes ?",
    "we point out the following three points :    * _ from additive to nonadditive case_. the codeword - stabilized quantum code formalism presents a unifying approach to both additive and nonadditive quantum error - correcting codes , for both binary and nonbinary states @xcite . *",
    "_ from binary to nonbinary case_. the stabilizer formalism , graph states and quantum error correcting codes for @xmath28-dimensional quantum systems have been extensively considered in @xcite and @xcite . however , as pointed out in @xcite , no straightforward extension of the stabilizer formalism in terms of generators within the pauli group is possible for @xmath28-level systems . as a consequence , it is possible that results obtained within the binary framework are no longer valid when taking into consideration weighted graph states .",
    "the generalizations of the pauli group , the clifford group , and the stabilizer states for qudits in a hilbert space of arbitrary dimension @xmath28 appears in @xcite .",
    "when moving into the nonbinary case , new features emerge .",
    "for instance , the symmetric adjacency matrix does not contain any longer binary entries as in the case of a simple graph as in qubit systems .",
    "the generalization of the pauli operators , the so - called weyl operators , are no longer hermitian .",
    "the finite field @xmath410 is replaced by the finite field of prime order @xmath28 and all arithmetic operations are defined modulo @xmath28 .",
    "the dimension @xmath28 can be naturally generalized to prime power dimension @xmath411 with @xmath412 being prime and @xmath413 being an integer .",
    "if , however , the underlying integer ring is no longer a field , one loses the vector space structure of @xmath414 , which demands some caution with respect to the concept of a basis . if @xmath28 contains multiple prime factors , the stabilizer , consisting of @xmath415 different elements , is in general no longer generated by a set of only @xmath416 generators . for the minimal generating set , more elements @xmath417 of the stabilizer might be needed as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to show that the action of the local ( generalized ) clifford group on nonbinary stabilizer states can be translated into operations on graphs .",
    "however , unlike the binary case , the single local complementation is replaced by a pair of two different graph - theoretic operations .",
    "furthermore , an efficient polynomial time algorithm to verify whether two graph states , in the non - binary case , are locally clifford equivalent is available @xcite . despite these challenges ,",
    "new important advances have been recently achieved .",
    "for instance , an explicit method of going from qudit css codes to qudit graph codes , including all the encoding and decoding procedures , has been presented in @xcite . * _ from discrete to continuous case_. a remarkable difference between discrete and continuous variables ( dv and cv , respectively ) quantum information is that while quantum states and unitary transformations involved are described by integer - valued parameters in the dv case , they are characterized by _",
    "real_-valued parameters in the cv case .",
    "the continuous - variable analog of the pauli and clifford algebras and groups together with sets of gates that can efficiently simulate any arbitrary unitary transformation in these groups were defined in @xcite .",
    "the standard pauli group for cv quantum computation on @xmath8 coupled oscillator is the heisenberg - weyl group @xmath418 which consists of phase - space displacement operators for the @xmath8 oscillators . unlike the discrete pauli group for qubits ,",
    "the group @xmath418 is a continuous lie group , and can therefore only be generalized by a set of continuously parametrized operators .",
    "furthermore , the clifford group for cv is the semidirect product group of the symplectic group and heisenberg - weyl group , @xmath419 , consisting of all phase - space translations along with all one - mode and two - mode squeezing transformations @xcite .",
    "this group is generated by inhomogeneous quadratic polynomials in the canonical operators . for dv ,",
    "it is possible to generate the clifford group using only the cnot , hadamard and phase gates .",
    "however , in the cv  case , the analog of these gates ( namely , the @xmath420 , the fourier @xmath421 and the phase @xmath422 gates with @xmath423 ) are all elements of @xmath424 .",
    "they are generated by homogeneous quadratic hamiltonians only .",
    "thus , they are in the subgroup of the clifford group . in order to generate the entire clifford group ,",
    "one requires a continuous @xmath425 transformation ( i.e. , a linear hamiltonian that generates a one - parameter subgroup of @xmath426 ) such as the pauli operator @xmath427 with @xmath428 .",
    "finally , the clifford group in the cv case is generated by the set @xmath429 .",
    "continuous - variable graph states were proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is of great relevance understanding the graph - theoretic transformation rules that describe both local unitary and local clifford unitary equivalences of arbitrary cv graph states . for a particular class of cv graph states , the so - called cv four - mode unweighted graph states , such transformation rules",
    "have been uncovered in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that even for such restricted class of states , the corresponding local clifford unitary can not exactly mirror that for the qubit case and a greater level of complexity arises in the cv framework .",
    "in addition , the complete implementation of local complementations for cv weighted graphs ( a weighted graph state is described by a graph @xmath133 in which every edge is specified by a factor @xmath430 corresponding to the strength of modes @xmath18 and @xmath431 ; for unweighted graph states , all the interactions have the same strength ) remains an open problem . in @xcite , the graphical description of local clifford transformations for cv weighted graph states were considered . in particular ,",
    "it was shown that unlike qubit weighted graph states , cv weighted graph states can be expressed by the stabilizer formalism in terms of generators in the pauli group .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that the cz gate for qubit is periodic as a function of the interaction strength while the cv cz gate is not .",
    "* * we remark that in this context , the cv case is even more subtle , besides the fact that weighted cv graph states are still stabilizer states unlike weighted qubit graph states . in particular , the most general form of weighted cv graph states has a complex adjacency matrix .",
    "in fact , all real - valued ( with real adjacency matrix ) cv graph states ( weighted or unweighted ) are unphysical states ( only defined in the limit of infinite squeezing ) . in order to represent physical cv graph states , corresponding to pure multi - mode gaussian states ,",
    "the weights become necessarily complex .",
    "all this is introduced and discussed in @xcite where it is also described how such general , physical cv graph states transform under local and general gaussian transformations . in particular , we emphasize that the general results presented in @xcite include zhang s results in @xcite as the limiting cases of infinite squeezing and real - weighted states .",
    "we recall that in the qubit - case a systematic classification of local clifford equivalence of qubit graph states has been executed and an efficient algorithm with polynomial time complexity in the number of qubits to decide whether two given stabilizer states are local clifford equivalent is known . in the cv  framework",
    ", it can be proved that any cv stabilizer state is equivalent to a weighted graph state under local clifford operations , the equivalence between two stabilizer states under local clifford operations can be investigated by studying the equivalence between weighted graph states under local clifford operations @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of a universal method to determine whether two cv stabilizer states with finite modes are equivalent or not under local clifford operation has been only partially addressed in @xcite**. * * in the cv case , the local - clifford equivalence of stabilizer states translates into local - gaussian unitary equivalence of ( pure ) gaussian states .",
    "furthermore , while a single unifying definition of complex - weighted cv  graph states ( gaussian pure states ) together with graph transformation rules for all local gaussian unitary operations were presented in @xcite , no systematic algorithm for deciding on the local equivalence of two given cv ( gaussian ) stabilizer states was discussed .",
    "this issue , however , was recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , necessary and sufficient conditions of gaussian local unitary equivalence for arbitrary ( mixed or pure ) gaussian states were derived . despite such advances ,",
    "several questions remain to be better understood .",
    "for instance , the relation between local equivalence of cv gaussian states and gaussian local equivalence deserves further investigation @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of this type of questions is not only important from a theoretical point of view , it can also be of practical use concerning which states are the most suitable for optical realizations of stabilizer quantum error correction codes in any dimension @xcite .    in view of these considerations , we conclude that the extension of our proposed scheme to arbitrary nonbinary / cv codes and/or additive / nonadditive codes might turn out to be nontrivial . however , in light of the recent advances , we are confident that its generalization could be achieved with a reasonable effort .",

    "the coincidence matrix of a graph characterizes the structural properties of a graph : number of vertices , number of edges , and , above all , the manner in which vertices are connected .",
    "the structure of graphs associated with stabilizer quantum codes hides essential information about the graphical error detection conditions in eqs .",
    "( [ wc1 ] ) and ( [ wc2 ] ) .",
    "such graphical conditions may not be necessarily visible in a direct manner as originally pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this becomes especially evident when the number of vertices and edges in the graph increases in the presence of multi - qubit encodings and/or big code lengths .",
    "however , graphs do maintain part of their appeal in that they provide a * * _ geometric _ * * aid in identifying the explicit * * _ algebraic _ * * linear equations that characterize the graphical error detection conditions without taking into consideration the explicit form of their corresponding coincidence matrices . in our opinion , this is no negligible advantage of our graphical approach since identifying the algebraic equations directly from the coincidence matrices can become quite tedious without a visual aid provided by graphs .",
    "clearly , the peculiar advantage of our scheme is that it allows to uncover the expression of the coincidence matrix of a graph associated with a binary stabilizer code .",
    "we shall further discuss some of these aspects in our illustrative examples that appear below .    as an additional side remark ,",
    "we point out that there could be scenarios where one can exploit the high symmetry of the graph in an efficient manner in order to check the graphical conditions for error detection @xcite . while symmetry arguments are elegant and powerful , they require some caution in the case of graphs in quantum error correction : symmetries of graphs are not necessarily the same as symmetries of the associated stabilizer codes @xcite .",
    "for instance , graphs with different symmetries can lead to a class of codes that are equivalent to the css seven - qubit code as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . as recently pointed out in @xcite , a clear understanding of the requirements under which a graph can exhibit the same symmetry as the quantum ( cws , in general ) code is still missing . in this article",
