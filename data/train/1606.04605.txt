    "e.g. , in atoms , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a constant and @xmath5 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "but in lower symmetry environments soc can be rather different",
    ". important instances of this were discovered by dresselhaus and rashba @xcite .    in spherically symmetric systems",
    "there is a maximum ( minimum ) state that can not be surpassed by applying a raising ( lowering ) angular momentum operator .",
    "this constrains which states are coupled by soc @xcite .",
    "however , we will see below , that in systems built from nanoscale structures these constraints are modified and very different spin - orbit hamiltonians are realized .",
    "we will consider systems where the internal energy scales within the nanostructure are large compared to the intra - structure energy scales , such that one may integrate many internal degrees of freedom out of a low - energy effective hamitlonian .    in molecular crystals",
    "the building blocks are fundamentally the molecules themselves @xcite .",
    "we will argue below that multi - nuclear coordination complexes @xcite provide an ideal platform to explore our ideas .",
    "but , we stress that our results apply equally to any other system with the same symmetry , for example , arrays of heavy atoms arranged into polygons on a surface @xcite or materials that form decorated lattice models @xcite .",
    "materials built from such nanostructures contain a hierachy of energy scales that makes them particularly flexible platforms for engineering specific soc hamiltonians tuned to different applications .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the most physically transparent version of the problem : molecules with @xmath6-fold cyclic symmetry ( @xmath7 ) . because the spherical symmetry of the atoms is strongly broken in the nanostructured environment it is not correct to view the soc as a linear combination of the soc on the atoms that make up the molecule .",
    "rather , there is an emergent ` spin molecular orbital coupling ' ( smoc ) that couples the electronic spin to currents running around the molecule .",
    "this result is quite general and the methodology described below can be extended to molecules or nanostructures with symmetries other than those discussed here .    for odd @xmath6-fold symmetric molecules ( e.g. , odd membered rings ) the consequences of smoc",
    "is highly analogous to the atomic soc ; but for even membered rings every angular momentum state can be both raised and lowered .",
    "we present density functional calculations that identify specific multi - nuclear organometallic complexes where the smoc is large compared to other relevant energy scales .",
    "we show that our postulated form of the smoc arises in the @xmath8 symmetric molecule mo@xmath9s@xmath10(dmit)@xmath9from these unbiased _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "finally , we explore a potential application of our findings : controlling the anisotropy of magnetic exchange interactions in systems where electronic correlations are strong .",
    "we show that the interplay of smoc with electronic correlations can give rise to effective spin models with compass hamiltonians .",
    "these models are known to give rise to many interesting states of matter , including some with topological order . unlike previous schemes to realize such hamiltonians ,",
    "these effects do not rely on hopping through intermediate atoms or molecules @xcite .",
    "this provides an example of how the soc can be controlled in molecular materials and engineered for a specific application .",
    "potential applications of designer soc include molecular qubits , spintronics and organic electronics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , strong soc is required to realize many symmetry protected topological phases of matter , such as topological insulators and superconductors , quantum spin hall states , axion insulators and weyl semimetals @xcite .",
    "when both soc and electronic correlations are strong additional phases are possible , including topological mott and kondo insulators @xcite .",
    "moreover , these ingredients allow for true topological order , which is characterized by long range - entanglement and often supports fractionalized quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "interest in this physics was redoubled by kitaev s exact solution @xcite of a compass model , _",
    "i.e. _ , a spin model with exchange interactions that are highly anisotropic in both real- and spin - space @xcite .",
    "kitaev found a topological spin liquid with non - abelian anyonic excitations , which is sufficient to enable fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "jackeli and khaliullin @xcite argued that the low - energy physics of a class of iridiumoxides ( iridates ) are described by the kitaev model because of their strong soc .",
    "however , it was soon realized that in this picture there must be a large isotropic exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that the kitaev model does not describe the iridates @xcite .",
    "this has renewed the search for materials that may realize the physics of the kitaev and other compass models @xcite .",
    "however , in previous proposals the soc arises from intra - atomic soc on a transition metal , which is surrounded by multiple light atoms , thus the soc is essentially atomic @xcite .",
    "in molecular crystals the electrons hop between molecular orbitals which are significantly larger than the atomic orbitals relevant in , say , transition metal oxides .",
    "this leads to an effective on - site coulomb interaction , @xmath11 , that is typically an order of magnitude smaller than in transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "however , the intra - molecular hopping integral , @xmath12 , is also typically an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this means that electrons in molecular crystals are typically strongly correlated .",
    "furthermore , this implies that the strength of the soc can be large relative to other relevant energy scales in molecular crystals .",
    "in atoms the soc increases with the atomic number .",
    "this remains true in molecules as heavier atoms imply larger gradients in the nuclear potential , cf .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) . in organic materials",
    "the largest contributions to soc typically arise from sulfur or selenium atoms @xcite . therefore",
    ", a powerful strategy for increasing soc is to move to organometallic complexes ; this has driven much recent progress in organic solar cells and organic light - emitting diodes @xcite .",
    "therefore , multi - nuclear organometallic complexes ( i.e. , molecules containing multiple transition metal atoms ) with ligands that facilitate effective charge transport between molecules @xcite provide a platform that allows for synthetic control and engineering of smoc beyond the possibilities available in inorganic systems .",

    "a variety of low - velocity approximations to the dirac equation can be constructed , such as the pauli , briet - pauli and regular approximations @xcite .",
    "the details of the pseudovector @xmath2 in the soc hamiltonian , @xmath13 , depend to some extent on which approximation is chosen .",
    "however , in what follows we will only make use of the symmetries of @xmath2 , which are independent of the low - velocity approximation as they are inherited from the dirac equation . in many low - velocity approximations",
    "one can write @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the momentum operator , and @xmath16 is a ( screened ) potential @xcite .",
    "thus , in a molecule @xmath16 is simply a linear superposition of the atomic potentials .",
    "but in molecular systems one expects that the expectation values of @xmath15 will be very different from those for electrons orbiting a single atom , particularly for states near the fermi energy .",
    "thus , in molecules it is not , in general , correct to assume that the soc is simply a linear superposition of the atomic soc ( @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "indeed , we will show below that this assumption would lead to the neglect of important physics .",
    "the standard approaches to this problem in molecular systems are either to evaluate the matrix elements of the full @xmath2 operator from first principles @xcite or to assume that only the soc on selected heavy atoms is relevant and the soc retains the spherical symmetry of the atomic case on those heavy atoms @xcite .",
    "the former approach has been widely applied to both organic and organometallic molecules while the latter approach has found wide applications in materials systems such as transition metals oxides and mononuclear coordination complexes . here",

    "nevertheless similar analyses can be carried out for molecules or nanostructures with arbitrary symmetry and in general will have a more complex interpretation .",
