    "credit scoring models are widely used by banks and other financial institutions , in order to assess the risk of default of applicants for loans .",
    "credit scoring can be thought of as a a classification problem .",
    "credit scoring models take a vector of attributes for a loan applicant , and given these attributes , attempt to discriminate between ` goods ' and ` bads ' ; that is , to discriminate between those that are not likely to default or be in arrears with their payments , and those that are .    a lending company in new zealand scores loan applicants based on 11 attributes obtained from an application form , which is filled out online when applying for a loan .",
    "the lending company had recently begun to incorporate data from an application called credit sense ( https://creditsense.com.au ) into their data warehouse , which automatically extracts line - by - line bank statement data from loan applicant s bank statements for a 90-day period of spending .",
    "the bank statement data is currently used for purposes such as income verification .",
    "the company was interested in exploring the potential of this data to be used for credit scoring .",
    "the company was firstly interested in seeing whether a sufficiently predictive scoring model could be created using only the bank statement - derived features , in which case the questions in the online application form would then be unnecessary to ask .",
    "if there are less questions to ask , loan applicants would be able to complete the application process faster , and the lending company would potentially be able to write more loans .",
    "if this model was not found to be sufficiently predictive , then the lending company was interested in investigating the extent to which the bank statement derived features could be of use in developing an improved scoring model by supplementing existing scoring features.a number of machine learning and statistical models have been used for experimentation in this paper .",
    "the novelty of our contribution is in the investigation of deriving features from bank statement data provided by loan applicants , which are not declared on the loan application form , to be used in credit scoring models . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "has not been studied previously . for this investigation ,",
    "firstly we construct * two baseline models*. the * first * , based solely on the existing scoring features , and the * second * , based solely on the new bank statement derived features .",
    "secondly , we create a * combined feature model * by combining the existing scoring features with the new bank statement - derived features .    our experimental results using roc analysis show firstly that the application form feature baseline model outperforms the bank statement baseline model , and in turn , a combined feature model performs better than both of the two baseline models .",
    "this indicates that the bank statement - derived features have value in supplementing , but not in replacing , the application form features .",
    "a naive bayes model consisting of the 11 existing application form features , along with 5 new bank statement derived features , was found to be the best performing model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some background on credit scoring will be provided in section 2 .",
    "section 3 will outline the research goals for this paper .",
    "section 4 will then provide a discussion of the methodology  in particular , the knowledge discovery in databases framework that will be used to guide the data mining and knowledge discovery process .",
    "section 5 will provide a brief outline of the candidate models that will be used in the experimentation .",
    "section 6 will review metrics for the evaluation of classification models for imbalanced data sets , and section 7 will discuss the characteristics of the target data set used .",
    "section 8 will summarize the experiments and their results with the different classifiers and feature sets .",
    "section 9 will evaluate the final model , and section 10 will conclude and discuss some avenues for further work .",
    "thomas , edelman & crook @xcite define credit scoring as  the set of decision models and their underlying techniques that aid lenders in the granting of consumer credit .",
    "these techniques decide who will get credit , how much credit they should get , and what operational strategies will enhance the profitability of the borrowers to the lenders \" .",
    "the present study is focused on models deciding who will get credit ( application scoring ) , rather than on modelling the behaviour of existing loans ( behavioural scoring ) .",
    "there has been a significant amount of academic research in the area of credit scoring .",
    "there exists a number of review papers in the literature on credit scoring including that by rosenberg and gleit @xcite , hand and henley @xcite and thomas @xcite .",
    "more recent expositions include that by abdou and pointon @xcite .",
    "yu et al @xcite also provides a useful summary in chapter 1 , althought the book primarily focused specifically on the use of support vector machines for credit scoring .",
    "there are a number of important benefits from making use of credit scoring models . while initially credit analysts in the industry used methods based on their own judgment , sophisticated statistical methods found their way into use and have generally been found to be more subjective , as well as enabling the large scale automation of the loan acceptance process , and writing more loans than they otherwise would have been able to , at lower cost .",
    "economic pressures from an increase in the demand for credit , as well as greater competition , and the development of new technology , are all factors that have led to the development of statistical models to aid the lending decision @xcite .",
    "not only are scoring models the only way of handling the large number of applicants nowadays , but also they seemingly produce more accurate classifications than the subjective judgemental assessments by human experts @xcite .    in assessing the credit risk of a loan applicant ,",
    "a lending company typically obtains applicant characteristics via an application form , as well as credit bureau checks , which are institutions that check the past credit history of applicants i.e. whether they have paid off previous loans that they have taken out in the past , whether they have had any defaults , or whether they have been declared bankrupt and so forth . in some cases ,",
    "an initial application form screens good and bad risk applicants , and only those who proceed past this stage are checked by credit bureau agencies  therefore avoiding unnecessary costs and providing quick credit application decision time to most applicants @xcite . in this case , the lending company sequentially assesses a loan application .",
    "as has been mentioned , credit scoring can be viewed as a classification problem , where we attempt to discriminate between good and bad risks , given their characteristics .",
    "a useful mathematical summary of the credit scoring evaluation problem is outlined in @xcite , and is summarized below :    let @xmath0 be a vector of m random variables that describe the information from a customer s application form and credit reference bureau .",
    "the actual value of the attributes for a specific loan applicant k are @xmath1 all samples are then given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of loan applicant samples in the data set , @xmath4 is the attribute vector of the @xmath5th applicant , and @xmath6 is the observed result of whether or not there was timely repayment .",
    "for example , we could define @xmath6 = 1 if the customer repaid the loan i.e. was a ` good ' , and @xmath6 = 0 if applicant @xmath5 did not repay the loan ( or was in arrears for some time ) .    in cases where we have both the attribute vector and the observed loan outcome , the data is labeled and",
    "thus we are able to make use of supervised learning models .",
    "therefore , it is natural to make use of machine learning and statistical models that are used for classification purposes .    in order to make an accurate judgment of the likelihood of @xmath6 , given the applicant s attribute vector @xmath7 ,",
    "there have been a number of models that have been applied to the problem , drawing from different disciplines including machine learning , statistics and operations research . by analyzing the techniques used in a large number of research papers , @xcite grouped these techniques broadly to fit within 5 categories ( table 1 ) .",

    "this research has supplemented features declared by loan applicants on a loan application form , that were currently used for credit scoring by a new zealand lending company , with undeclared features that were extracted from bank statements provided by loan applicants .",
    "this work has highlighted the potential of using bank statement information through applications such as credit sense , to obtain additional features to improve credit scoring .",
    "although the bank statement features were not sufficiently predictive by themselves , our experimental results showed that a number of the bank statement derived features have value in supplementing the application form features , in improving a credit scoring model .",
    "in particular , we found that a naive bayes model that used 16 combined features provided the best performance in terms of area under the roc curve .",
    "this 16 feature model consisted of all 11 application form features that are currently used for credit scoring by the lending company , along with 5 new features derived from the bank statements .",
    "these 5 features were : amount withdrawn from atm machines , other loan repayments per month , whether they bank with kiwibank , whether they hold a visa card , and the number of bank accounts held .",
    "there are a number of avenues for further work .",
    "one area is to extend this work is by incorporating reject inference methods .",
    "this involves attempting to assign a ` value ' to rejected applicants or determining the status of each reject and then using this ` value ' in the target data set @xcite .",
    "this was not possible in the present study due to the non - availability of this type of data .",
    "this work has also highlighted the potential of naive bayes to be used with extremely imbalanced data sets .",
    "it is interesting to note that naive bayes was not considered to be a commonly applied model in the credit scoring domain by @xcite .",
    "we intend to perform further investigation of the ability of naive bayes to be used in the credit scoring context , and specifically with highly imbalanced data sets .",
    "another extension would be to further investigate the costs of misclassification with the lending company .",
    "this would involve coming up with accurate estimates of the cost of false negatives , and the cost of false positives . in doing so",
    ", the lending company would be moving to the appropriate trade - off point on the roc curve .    from an organizational perspective ,",
    "further work would be required in implementing the credit scoring model in practice e.g. integrating the model with the data warehouse and other it systems , testing and so on .    in a separate line ,",
    "data from bank statements obtained through applications like credit sense could be used in investigating possible fraud cases , for example , by using methods of outlier detection .",
