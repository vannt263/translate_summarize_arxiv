    "the problem of isolating a clean cmb signal from contaminations originating from milky way is of primary importance to a cosmologist . according to the slowly rolling single scalar field inflationary scenario",
    "the primordial perturbations follow gaussianity to a very good approximation , any non gaussian properties predicted to be a small effect  ( @xcite ) . since cmb anisotropies are directly related to these perturbations via the spacetime metric one expects cmb to follow gaussian distribution .",
    "it was shown by  @xcite that non - gaussian effect introduced in cmb after decoupling is also small .",
    "it has been shown by  @xcite that cmb data observed by wmap satellite  ( @xcite ) is consistent with primordial gaussian fluctuation .",
    "contrary to these , diffuse foreground components , originating from our own galaxy exhibit highly non - gaussian properties due to non - linearities involved in the physical processes during their origin .",
    "based upon simple assumption of pure gaussian properties of cmb and non - gaussian nature of diffuse foregrounds , in this paper , we propose a new foreground removal method from cmb maps . a detailed account on several other foreground removal methods",

    "a measure of non - gaussian properties inherent in a collection of @xmath4 random samples is given by so called kurtosis statistic , ( @xmath5 ) . for a set , @xmath6 , of @xmath4 random samples , @xmath7 ,",
    "the @xmath5 statistic is defined as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes sample mean and @xmath10 is the standard deviation of samples .",
    "@xmath11 for samples drawn from gaussian distribution whereas as discussed in section  [ kurt ] foreground distributions possess large positive kurtosis .",
    "let @xmath12 denotes foreground contaminated cmb map in thermodynamic temperature unit at @xmath0 resolution at a frequency index @xmath13 and @xmath14 represents total number of available frequency bands .",
    "@xmath12 is a column vector of @xmath15 numbers where @xmath15 is the number of surviving pixels at a frequency band after masking the known point source positions .",

    "we choose these factors such that @xmath5 value for @xmath18 is minimized with an imposed constraint on them that @xmath19 .",

    "instead , we find the minimum of @xmath20 by invoking a non - linear search algorithm due to powell .",
    "the distributions of pixel temperatures due to diffuse galactic foregrounds are shown in top panel of fig .  [ kvals ] .",
    "each of these foreground distributions is strongly asymmetric and exhibits a long tail towards positive temperature direction indicating a variation slower than @xmath32 , which is the case for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the peak for the synchrotron distribution shows that at @xmath33ghz most likely contamination due to synchrotron occurs at a temperature @xmath34 , although contaminations at high ( @xmath35 ) and low ( e.g. , as low as @xmath36 ) pixel temperature are also likely .",
    "how does @xmath5 vary with foreground contamination in cmb maps at different wmap frequencies ? to answer this question we generate @xmath37 random full sky cmb maps using wmap s lcdm power spectrum . with each of these random realization of cmb map",

    "[ kvals ] for all wmap frequency bands . for each band",
    "@xmath5 increases as the amount of foreground contamination increases . for k band",
    "the variation takes a shape of a plateau , characterized by a slow increase of @xmath5 , as the foreground level reaches @xmath38 of its full level . for all bands",
    "@xmath5 becomes more than @xmath37 when all foregrounds are operative at their @xmath39 level .",
    "it is interesting to note that the q band ( not the k band which has the highest level of synchrotron and free free contamination ) shows the largest @xmath5 value among all the @xmath1 bands at the maximum foreground strength .",
    "we validate the methodology by performing monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we use mem foreground maps for synchrotron , free free and thermal dust available from lambda website .",
    "these maps are provided in a common resolution of @xmath0 and at pixel resolution parameter @xmath40 in antenna millikelvin temperature unit .",
    "we upgrade the pixel resolution of each map to @xmath41 and convert them to thermodynamic microkelvin unit .",
    "we add the composite foreground map of each wmap frequency with a random realization of cmb compatible to lcdm model to make foreground contaminated cmb maps at each of the wmap frequencies . finally , we mask the position of the known point sources using the wmap s 7 year point source mask .",
    "we develop a c code ( hereafter _ gaussmap _ ) to implement constrained powell s conjugate gradient method .",
    "we perform @xmath42 monte - carlo simulations of foreground removal method . from these simulations",
    "we find that the foreground removal is effective over almost all parts of the sky .",
    "however , we find visible signature of some residual foreground emission in the inner plane of the galaxy . to find out the sky regions where the residual foreground could be significant compared to the expected cmb signal we subtract average of input cmb maps from the average of foreground cleaned maps .",
    "then we form an initial mask by assigning zero values to all pixels with absolute temperature values more than @xmath43k of this map and unity at all other pixels .",
    "this mask contains a set of scattered pixels in the inner galactic plane . to remove these pixels we first smooth the initial mask by a gaussian window of @xmath0 .",
    "we transform this smoothed mask to a new mask by assigning all pixels of smoothed mask with values greater than or equal to @xmath44 to a new value of unity and the all other pixels to zero . to exclude position of the known point sources from the analysis we make the final mask multiplying this mask by the wmap s point source mask .",
    "we call the resulting mask as g20 mask",
    ". this retains @xmath45 of the entire sky area .",

    "the mean kurtosis obtained from all the cleaned maps is given by @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath47 detection of non gaussianity from the cleaned maps .",
    "we interpret the non - vanishing @xmath48 in terms of residual foreground contamination originating from the galactic plane . after flagging of the pixels determined by the g20",
    "mask we obtain , @xmath49 , which is consistent with zero . henceforth , we use g20 mask as the basic mask to remove pixels contaminated by the residual foreground while analyzing cleaned maps from monte - carlo simulations as well as wmap data . the mean weights for",
    "@xmath1 frequency bands satisfy , @xmath50 .      using the monte - carlo simulations we verify that the pixel temperature of cleaned maps outside the g20 mask follows a gaussian distribution . for this",
    "we apply g20 mask both to a randomly chosen cmb realization and its foreground cleaned counterpart .",
    "to verify the gaussian nature of these distributions we fit the histogram of input cmb map ( after g20 mask is applied ) by a normalized gaussian probability distribution , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote respectively mean and standard deviation of the distribution . from the fit we find that , @xmath54 and @xmath55  .",
    "we apply g20 mask on each of the @xmath42 foreground cleaned cmb maps and estimate full sky estimate of cmb power spectrum using master method  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the average of @xmath42 power spectra obtained from the foreground removed maps matches excellently with the average of the input cmb power spectra .",
    "we show both spectra in fig .",
    "[ nobiascl ] along with the cosmic variance .",
    "this verifies that no significant foreground contamination exists outside the g20 mask and the method outlined in this paper can be used to estimate cmb power spectrum to extract cosmological information .        in some of the earlier publications  ( @xcite ) the authors reported that the harmonic space based ilc method gives rise to a negative bias in its power spectrum at the low multipoles .",
    "the bias appears due to a mere chance correlation between cmb and foregrounds at large angles due to availability of only small number of modes in the large scales on the sky . in principle",
    ", the negative bias in the power spectrum can be present in both pixel based and multipole based ilc algorithms which rely upon minimization of net foreground variance from the cleaned map , since in these cases the finite correlation between cmb and foregrounds arises due to certain degree of overlap between hot spots and cold spots of cmb and foregrounds and the algorithm creates a negative bias due to nonlinear dependence of weights on the empirical covariance matrix  ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the foreground removal method described in this paper relies upon the gaussian nature of the final distribution , without explicitly minimizing the variance of the data .",
    "this leads to the advantage that the power spectrum obtained from the cleaned map does not have any negative bias .",
    "before the analysis we mask out the positions of known point sources from each of wmap s @xmath1 frequency maps using the point source mask .",
    "after masking each map contains @xmath56 pixels comprising @xmath57 of the full sky area .",
    "we use _ gaussmap _ code to estimate the best fit weight factors corresponding to different frequency bands .",
    "the code gives best choice of weights as @xmath58 for k to w bands corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "the complete procedure to estimate the weights takes only about a couple of minutes on an intel 2.26 ghz processor . as one might expect",
    ", v band gets the maximum positive weight since it is supposed to be the least foreground contaminated frequency band in the wmap observation window .",
    "the kurtosis for cleaned map outside the g20 mask becomes @xmath60 .",
    "we note that weights obtained from wmap data have similar values to the mean weights obtained from monte - carlo simulations in section  [ validity ] .    using the weights described above we obtain the foreground cleaned cmb map ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ gmap ] , hereafter gmap ) .",
    "although there are some visible signature of presence of residual foreground contamination in this map on the galactic plane ( e.g. cygnus region , cassiopeia a , carina nebula ) all contaminations are confined only near the galactic plane .",
    "we show the difference between gmap and wmap s @xmath2 year ilc map outside the g20 mask in bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ gmap ] . in the unmasked difference map",
    "larger pixel amplitudes are confined near the galactic plane , making a narrow strip - like structure , with absolute pixel temperature exceeding @xmath61 .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ gmap ] shows that applying g20 mask significantly reduces pixel amplitude of the difference map ..",
    "we test for the distribution of pixel temperature of gmap outside the g20 mask .",
    "the average pixel temperature of this map outside the g20 mask is only @xmath62 .",
    "hence we fit for a gaussian probability function with mean @xmath63 and variance @xmath53 to the pixel temperature distribution of the masked gmap . from the fit we obtain , @xmath64 .",
    "we show the distribution outside g20 mask obtained from gmap and the wmap s ilc map in fig .",
    "we also show in this figure pixel temperature distributions of individual frequency bands .",
    "the long tails for k and ka bands are due to strong synchrotron contamination .",
    "we note that all the distributions corresponding to 5 frequency bands are asymmetric representing their non - gaussian nature .",
    "pixel temperature of simulated frequency maps have distributions similar to these histograms .      to estimate power spectrum from gmap we first apply g20 mask and estimate the partial sky cmb power spectrum .",
    "we convert the partial sky power spectrum to the full sky estimate by inverting the mode - mode coupling matrix .",
    "finally we remove both beam and pixel effect from this power spectrum .",
    "we show the resulting power spectrum in fig .",
    "as shown in this figure this power spectrum matches well with the ilc power spectrum estimated from the same sky region until @xmath65 . beyond this multipole range",
    "gmap power spectrum has less power than the ilc power spectrum . from the gmap we find @xmath66 and @xmath67 consistent with ilc estimates ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "in this paper we have developed , validated and applied on @xmath2 year wmap data a global foreground minimization method from cmb sky based upon the measure of non - gaussian nature of the diffuse galactic foregrounds .",
    "the gmap obtained by this method matches well with the wmap s ilc map outside the g20 mask .",
    "the power spectrum from gmap also matches excellently with the power spectrum of ilc map until @xmath70 . at",
    "even higher @xmath71 we find less power than wmap s ilc map . the kurtosis value of the foreground minimized map outside the g20 mask , @xmath72",
    ", the error is estimated from monte - carlo simulations of foreground removal method .",
    "this is only a @xmath73 effect implying that the cmb sky outside the g20 region is sufficiently clean so that the signals from this region may be interpreted to have cosmological origin consistent with standard cosmological scenario .",
    "a crucial advantage of the method over the usual variance based ilc method is that the former does not possesses any negative bias at low multipoles .",
    "the quadrupole moment estimated by us matches excellently with the wmap s ilc estimate .",
    "our result shows that the problem of low quadrupole moment persist in wmap data .",
    "the quadrupole and octopole maps also show similar nature as the ones estimated from the wmap s ilc map .",
    "the problem of quadrupole and octopole alignment using gmap would be investigated in a future paper - however , given the similarity between gmap and ilc map ( at the least , outside the g20 mask ) the alignment likely to remain .",
    "another direction for future research would be to implement the method in the harmonic domain of the maps .",
    "the method can be generalized to estimate cmb angular power spectrum down to low angular scale following approaches described in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "since polarized foreground models are poorly known , an excellent research direction would be to apply our method on polarization sensitive cmb data released by wmap and planck satellite mission  ( @xcite ) .",
    "our method shows that it is possible to remove foregrounds from the cmb sky purely based upon non - gaussian nature of non - cosmological signals .",
    "however , if there is any cosmological signal of non - gaussian origin the method would interpret them as _ foregrounds _ and hence would try to eliminate the signal from the cleaned map .",
    "therefore comparing the gmap with other foreground minimized maps which do not explicitly rely upon the assumption of non - gaussianity one may be able to isolate any possible primordial and/or secondary non - gaussian signal . estimating a gaussian cmb map using data from current and future generation sensitive cmb experiments like planck and cmbpol would play an important role to unfold this scientific information .",
    "we thankfully acknowledge useful discussions with tarun souradeep and jayanta kumar bhattyacharjee . some of the results of this paper are obtained by using healpix software package  @xcite  .",
    "we acknowledge use of lambda data repository for our analysis ."
