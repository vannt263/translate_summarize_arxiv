    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are one of the most energetic phenomena in the universe .",
    "thanks to _ swift _ observations , it has now become evident that grbs are basically categorized into two , namely short - hard and long - soft bursts ( e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "more surprisingly , grbs with some mixed features of the two types have been reported ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) possibly necessitating a new classification @xcite .",
    "the mystery of their central engines seems to be thickening , which has long puzzled astrophysicists since the accidental discovery in the late 1960s ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "regarding the long - duration grbs ( lgrbs ) , robust associations of the underlying supernovae with a handful of lgrbs ( e.g. , @xcite , and collective references in @xcite ) and the fact that their host galaxies are typically irregular with intense star formation @xcite suggest that they are likely related to the deaths of massive stars and the `` collapsar '' model has been widely recognized as the standard scenario for lgrbs @xcite .    in the scenario , the collapsed iron core of a massive star forms a temporary disk around a few @xmath2 black hole ( bh ) and accretes at a high rate ( @xmath3 , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , whose gravitational binding energy is the driving source of the central engine . @xcite and",
    "@xcite pioneeringly proposed that pairs of neutrino and anti - neutrino illuminated from the hyperaccreting disks that annihilate into electron and positron ( e.g. , @xmath4 , hereafter `` neutrino pair annihilation '' ) can supply sufficient energy to launch grb outflows by heating material in the polar funnel regions .",
    "in addition , it is suggested that the strong magnetic fields in the cores of order of @xmath5 play also an active role both for driving the magneto - driven jets and for extracting a significant amount of energy from the central engine ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "although various possibilities including magnetar models ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been proposed so far , there has been no direct evidence to pin down the mechanism of the central engine .",
    "this is mainly because it is difficult to extract the information from conventional astronomy by electromagnetic waves , since high - energy photons are absorbed through interactions in the source and by the photon backgrounds . alternatively ,",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are expected to be a primary observable to decipher the mechanism of the engine , because they imprint a live information hidden deep inside the stellar core and they carry the information directly to us without being affected in propagating to the earth .",
    "currently long - baseline laser interferometers such as ligo @xcite , virgo , geo600 , and tama300 @xcite are operational ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) . for these detectors , core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne )",
    "have been proposed as one of the most plausible gw sources , therefore an extensive study of the gw predictions based on sophisticated numerical modeling has been carried out so far ( see , for example , @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "it is noted however that most of them have paid attention to ccsne that leave behind neutron stars ( nss ) after explosions . for a reliable prediction of gws from ccsne",
    ", one needs to perform multi - d hydrodynamic simulations equipped with a precise neutrino transport scheme which follows the dynamics starting from stellar core - collapse , core - bounce , through shock - stall and subsequent growth of hydrodynamic instabilities , the neutrino - driven shock revival , to stellar explosion in a consistent manner .",
    "this is one of the most challenging subjects in computational astrophysics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the numerical modeling to test the collapsar scenario could be much more demanding .",
    "one needs to trace a new path that bifurcates from the above story after bounce , namely to the bh formation ( phase 1 ) , evolution of the surrounding accretion disk including energy deposition to the polar funnel region by neutrinos and/or magnetic fields ( phase 2 ) , to the launching of the fireballs ( phase 3 ) .",
    "this apparently necessitates the multidimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations not only with general relativity ( gr ) for handling the bh formation , but also with the multi - angle neutrino transfer for treating highly anisotropic neutrino radiation from the disks . in the business of ccsn simulations",
    ", the most up - to - date simulations can now follow the multi - angle neutrino transport but limited to a newtonian case @xcite , or handle gr with a sophisticated neutrino transport @xcite but not applicable to a rapidly rotating case ( due to the assumption of conformal flatness ) .",
    "various approximate approaches have been therefore undertaken in the business of the collapsar simulations . in the phase 1 ,",
    "gr simulations @xcite updated to implement a neutrino cooling have reported recently @xcite , in which the dynamics after the bh formation to the formation of accretion disk was first consistently followed .",
    "the numerical studies of the phase 2 are concerned with the subsequent evolution of accretion disk and the outflow formation in the polar funnel region till the jets become mildly relativistic . the central bh has been traditionally treated by a fixed metric technique in gr simulations ( e.g.,@xcite ) or by an absorbing boundary in the newtonian simulations ( e.g. , @xcite or special relativistic simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as for the microphysics in these simulations , except for @xcite ,",
    "a realistic nuclear equation of state ( eos ) has been replaced by a very phenomenological one ( like a gamma - law or polytrope ) and the neutrino cooling ( and heating ) has been often neglected for simplicity .",
    "numerical studies of the phase 3 are mainly concerned with the dynamics later on , namely , the jet propagation to the breakout from the star , by assuming a manual energy input to the polar funnel region ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all of the studies mentioned above may be regarded as complimentary in the sense that the different epochs are focused on , with the different initial conditions for the numerical modeling being undertaken .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", @xcite is the only work which extracted the gw signals based on their collapsar simulations ( in the phase 1 ) .",
    "based on their three - dimensional ( 3d ) gr simulations of a 75 @xmath2 star with the use of a polytropic eos , they pointed out that the significant gw emission is associated at the moment of the black hole formation , which can be a promising target of the advanced ligo for a galactic source .",
    "in contrast to such a paucity of the gw predictions based on numerical simulations of collapsars , a number of semi - analytical estimates have been reported so far , which predict a significantly strong gw emission due to possible density - inhomogeneities @xcite , bar or fragmentation instabilities in the collapsar s accretion torii ( e.g. , @xcite , and collective references in @xcite ) , and the precession of the disks due to gr effects @xcite .",
    "the predicted gw amplitudes are typically high enough be visible to advanced - ligo class detectors for a 100 mpc distance scale , which is about four orders - of - magnitudes larger than the numerical estimate at the black formation @xcite .",
    "in addition to these gws produced by non - spherical matter motions , @xcite pointed out that anisotropic neutrino emission from accretion disk could be the source of gws from collapsars , which was originally proposed as an equally important gw source to the matter gw in the context of ccsne @xcite . since these gws from collapsars would be a smoking - gun signature of the central engine in coincident with the conventional electromagnetic messengers as well as neutrinos",
    ", it will be very important to put forward theoretical predictions of gw signals based on the collapsar simulations , as has been done in the business of ccsne .    in this work ,",
    "we study possible gw signatures in the hyperaccreting collapsar disks by performing two - dimensional special relativistic ( sr ) mhd simulations of accretion torii around a black hole . we compute nine models by adding angular momenta and magnetic fields parametrically to a precollapse core of a @xmath0 progenitor star @xcite . as for the microphysics , a realistic equation of state",
    "is employed and the neutrino cooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme . in our sr simulations ,",
    "the central black hole is treated as an absorbing boundary . by doing so",
    ", we focus on the gws generated by asphericities in neutrino emission and matter motions in the vicinity of the accretion disks . to accurately estimate gws produced by anisotropic neutrino emission",
    ", we perform a ray - tracing analysis in gr by a post - processing procedure . by employing a stress formula that includes contributions both from magnetic fields and special relativistic corrections , we study also the effects of magnetic fields on the gravitational waveforms .",
    "then we discuss their detectability by performing a spectrum analysis .",
    "the paper opens up with descriptions of the initial models and numerical methods ( section [ methods ] ) .",
    "the main results are given in section [ results ] .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss their implications in section [ summary ] .",
    "regarding our precollapse model , we take a 35 @xmath6 star ( model 35oc ) in @xcite that is supposed to be one of the most promising grb progenitor models .",
    "to study the effects of rotation systematically , we take the following rotational profiles as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are model parameters .",
    "@xmath10 is the mass coordinate at the cylindrical radius ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the specific angular momentum in the last stable orbit of the schwarzshild bh ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by changing @xmath15 in the range of @xmath16 , we compute 7 non - magnetized models of @xmath15 = 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.1 , and 1.2 , by which they are labeled as models j0.6 , j0.7 , and so on ( see figure 1 ) . to see the effects on magnetic fields ,",
    "we compute two more models , in which the initial magnetic field ( @xmath17 g or @xmath18 g ) are added to model j0.8 ( model j0.8b10 or model j0.8b11 ) , in which the initial field is assumed to be purely poloidal and also assumed to be uniform and parallel to the spin axis .",
    "figure 1 shows profiles of the initial angular momentum for some models . as shown ,",
    "our models are taken to possess much more rapid rotation especially in the range of 1 to 4 @xmath2 in the mass coordinate compared to the original profile of model 35oc ( black dashed line ) .",
    "we set such a rotational profile otherwise the accretion disk can not survive later than @xmath192 s after the onset of gravitational collapse in our simulation .",
    "later on , the accretion disk is swallowed to the central object due to the neutrino cooling which deprives the pressure support in the disk . in this case",
    ", one can not account for the duration of long bursts , the activity of which is typically longer than @xmath20 s , and can last up to tens of minutes .",
    "so we experimentally choose to adjust the initial angular momentum as in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "although our models do have higher initial angular momentum , the deviation may not be so serious ( compare the light blue line that is for the angular momentum amplified by a factor of 2 in the original progenitor ) considering uncertainties in stellar evolution calculations ( such as in the treatment of mass - loss , weak interactions , and fluid instabilities ( e.g. , convection , semiconvection , rotation , and magnetic fields ) ) . to mimic the original progenitor structure , we take @xmath9 to be the size of the fe core ( @xmath21 ) . by setting @xmath22 , @xmath23 , the above profile becomes most close to the original profile for the mass coordinates larger than @xmath24 . as a side - remark , a most prevailing way is to tune the initial angular momentum to satisfy its local centrifugal force to be several percent - levels of the local gravitational binding energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our modeling may be more realistic in the sense that the assumed initial angular momentum profiles capture the basic trend obtained in the current progenitor models .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , a number of newtonian and sr collapsar simulations in the phase 2 have conventionally focused on the evolution of the collapsar disks by treating the central bh as an absorbing boundary . following the tradition of setting the boundary from the beginning of the simulation",
    ", we also initially impose an absorbing inner - boundary condition at the radius of @xmath25 with @xmath26 is the schwarzschild radius that is estimated by the accumulating mass inside the inner - boundary .",
    "then we solve the dynamics outside the inner boundary up to the outer boundary of the computational domain ( 30000 km in radius ) by our srmhd code assuming axisymmetry and equatorial symmetry ( see @xcite for more details ) . in our 2d simulations ,",
    "spherical coordinates are employed with logarithmic zoning in the radial direction ( @xmath27 ) and regular zoning in the polar direction ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the computational domain is covered by 300(@xmath27 ) @xmath29 40(@xmath30 ) mesh points .",
    "regarding the microphysics , a realistic nuclear equation of state by @xcite is included and the neutrino cooling is treated by a multi - flavor leakage scheme ( e.g. , @xcite , see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the gravitational potential is estimated by the sum of the paczynski & witta - type potential which mimics the gravitational pull from the central bh and the self - gravity of material outside the excised region that is determined by the poisson equation ( see equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we examine numerical models without viscosity like the alpha prescription ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "to extract the gravitational waveforms from matter motions and magnetic fields , we employ the stress formulae derived in @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we shortly summarize them in the following .    in our axisymmetric case ,",
    "the non - vanishing quadrupole term is only the plus mode ( @xmath31 ) in the metric perturbation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can be written as , @xmath32 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the quadrupole amplitude of matter gws ; @xmath33 that consists of the following three parts , @xmath34 the first term in equation ( [ a20 ] ) represents the contribution from non - spherical hydrodynamic motions , which is expressed by @xmath35 in which @xmath36 is the effective density defined as , @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , denotes the baryon density , internal energy , pressure , the speed of light , and gravitational constant , respectively , and @xmath43 is related to the energy density of the magnetic fields with @xmath44 representing the magnetic field in the laboratory frame ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath45 is the lorentz boost factor with @xmath46 denoting the spatial velocity in the spherical coordinates ( @xmath47 .",

    "is the contribution from the magnetic fields as , @xmath51 .",
    "\\label{mag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , we write the total gravitational amplitude as follows for later convenience , @xmath52 where the quantities of the right hand of the equation are defined by combining equations ( [ htt ] ) and ( [ a20 ] ) with equations ( [ quad ] ) , ( [ grav ] ) , and ( [ mag ] ) . note that by dropping @xmath53 terms , the above formulae reduce to the conventional quadrupole formula employed in the newtonian simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the collapsar disk that we pay attention in this work , the condition of @xmath54 in equation ( [ quad ] )",
    "is generally satisfied inside the disk .",
    "if the disk is perfectly in a stationary state , which means the centrifugal force ( @xmath55 ) balance with the gravitational forces ( e.g. , equation ( [ grav ] ) ) , no gws can be emitted .",
    "as will be explained later , the disk attains mass continuously due to mass - accretion whose specific angular momentum increases outward ( e.g. , figure 1 ) .",
    "this is the primary reason of generating non - zero matter gws from axisymmetrically but dynamically rotating collapsar disks . in the following computations ,",
    "we assume that the observer is located in the equatorial plane ( @xmath56 in equation ( [ htt ] ) ) , and also that the distance to the gw source is comparable to nearly grb - associated core - collapse supernovae ( @xmath57 ) unless stated otherwise .      to compute the gravitational waveforms from anisotropic neutrino radiation",

    "later on , the density configuration ( compare the left - half in each panel ) deforms to be more oblate with time due to accretion of material with higher angular momentum outside ( e.g. , figure [ f1 ] ) . as will be explained in the later section ,",
    "the luminous accretion disk is the primary source of the gws from anisotropic neutrino emission .",

    "since the rotational velocity of the accretion disk is perpendicular to the polar direction , the special relativistic beaming effect suppresses the neutrino emission toward the polar region . as a result",
    ", the neutrino fluxes are made dark ( right - hand side in the middle right panel ) because the direction of the rotating material is opposite to the direction to the observer . to study the gr effects on the neutrino luminosity",
    ", we place @xmath139 in the central region , which mimics the event horizon of the bh .",
    "the effects of the bh spin are examined by setting the kerr parameter by hand as @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the schwarzschild and the extreme kerr geometry , respectively .",
    "the bottom panels of figure [ f12 ] are for the extreme kerr geometry , which however looks very similar to the middle panels .    for a more detailed comparison ,",
    "the left panel of figure [ f13 ] shows the neutrino luminosity per solid angle @xmath142 for the minkowski ( indicated by `` sr '' ) , schwarzschild ( `` gr(a=0 ) ) '' , and extreme kerr geometry ( `` gr(a=0.99 ) ) '' , respectively .",
    "the most important message in this panel is that in every case , the neutrino luminosity seen from the direction near parallel to the spin axis ( @xmath143 ) becomes higher than the one seen from the equatorial direction ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is because the cross section of the pan - cake like accretion disk seen from the spin axis becomes larger compared to the one seen from the horizontal direction ( figure [ f12 ] ) . remembering again that @xmath59 in equation ( [ graph1 ] ) is positive near the north and south polar caps , the dominance of the polar neutrino luminosities make the neutrino gws positive in the polar cap regions ( right panel in figure [ f13 ] )",
    "this is the reason that the neutrino gws increase monotonically with time ( e.g. , left panel of figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that from neutrino luminosity ( @xmath144 in figure [ f4 ] ) , their typical duration ( @xmath145 ) , anisotropy in the neutrino radiation ( @xmath146 , read from the left panel of figure [ f13 ] ) , the gw amplitudes from neutrinos can be estimated from equation ( [ tt ] ) as @xmath147 which is in good agreement with the numerical results ( figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "comparing to the sr with gr case in the left panel of figure [ f13 ] , the neutrino luminosity becomes smaller by @xmath148 in the gr case due to the gr redshift and also due to the bending effects .",
    "comparing the green line with the blue line , the frame - dragging effect due to the bh spin barely affects the emergent neutrino luminosity .",
    "this is probably because the gr effect on the neutrino luminosity becomes important only in the central regions very close to the bh ( e.g. , figure 15 @xcite ) .",
    "our results indicate that a ray - tracing calculation in the schwarzschild geometry is at least needed to accurately estimate the neutrino gws in the collapsar s environment .       in equation ( [ total ] ) and @xmath149 in equation ( [ tt ] ) ) , while `` matter '' , `` rotational energy '' , `` gravity '' , and `` neutrino '' represents the contribution from matter ( @xmath150 in equation ( [ total ] ) ) , rotational energy ( see text for the definition ) , gravity ( @xmath151 in equation ( [ total ] ) ) , and neutrino emission ( @xmath149 in equation ( [ tt ] ) ) , respectively . ]",
    "now we shortly analyze the matter gws in model j0.8 . as summarized in section [",
    "2.2 ] , the matter gws are estimated by the sum of the hydrodynamic and gravity parts in equations ( [ quad ] , [ grav ] ) for non - magnetized models . among the kinetic energy terms ( @xmath152 ) in equation ( [ quad ] )",
    ", the largest contribution comes from the rotational energy ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) , which is shown in figure [ f8 ] ( green line ) .",
    "in contrast to the negative contribution by this term , the gravity part ( blue line labeled by `` gravity '' in figure [ f8 ] ) is shown to make a positive contribution .",
    "if a star rotates perfectly stationary , the centrifugal forces balance with the gravitational force , leading to no gws . in the collapsar disk studied in this work ,",
    "the disk attains mass continuously due to mass - accretion with increasing its specific angular momentum outward .",
    "this is the reason why the disk is not perfectly stationary , leading to a non - zero gw emission from matter motions ( see pink line labeled by `` matter '' in figure [ f8 ] ) .",
    "however , their gw amplitudes are much smaller compared to those from anisotropic neutrino emission ( compare the pink line with the light blue line ( neutrino gws ) in figure [ f8 ] )",
    ".    the left panel of figure [ f9 ] shows a normalized contribution of each term in @xmath154 at @xmath155 s for model j0.8 , which is estimated by the volume integral of @xmath154 within a given sphere enclosed by certain radius .",
    "the region in a radius between 50 km to 160 km is shown to contribute to produce gws , which corresponds to a high density region in the accretion disk ( see the bottom panel in figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "it can be also shown that the radial gradient of the gravitational potential ( green line indicated by `` gravity ( @xmath27 ) '' in the plot ) closely cancels with the contribution from the centrifugal force ( red line ) in the disk .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ f9 ] , the enclosed mass there becomes as big as @xmath156 as a result of the hyperaccreting activity lasting @xmath19 9 s till then , and the typical rotational period there is the order of milliseconds ( red line ) .",
    "putting these numbers to the standard gw stress formula ( e.g. , @xcite ) , an upper bound of the matter gw amplitudes may be estimated as @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the distance to the source , @xmath159 is the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 represents the typical mass and radius of the accretion disk and the timescale which we may take as the rotational period , respectively , and @xmath164 is the degree of the nonsphericity , which we take optimistically as 10 @xmath165 in the case of the accretion disk .",
    "this estimate , roughly consistent with the numerical results ( e.g. , right panel of figure 3 ) , also shows that anisotropic neutrino emission , producing the gw amplitude on the order of @xmath166 for a source of 100 mpc , is the primary source in the long term evolution of collapsars ( @xmath167 s ) ( see equation ( [ gnu ] ) ) .",
    "now we discuss the effects of magnetic fields on the waveforms by taking model j0.8b11 that has a strongest initial magnetic field in our models . in figure",
    "[ f10 ] , the pink line represents the gws from magnetic fields ( equation ( [ mag ] ) ) .",
    "but , first of all , let us shortly comment on the burst - like feature of the green line ( contributed from matter motions ) at @xmath168 s in the figure .",
    "this may look similar to the burst of gws emitted at the moment of the bh formation possibly followed by a damped sinusoidal oscillation ( @xcite ) , but this can be only captured in full gr simulations @xcite . as already seen in the luminosity plot of figure [ f4 ] , the above burst simply corresponds to the shock formation at the center in our sr models . back to the main point ,",
    "we analyze the increasing trend of the gws from magnetic fields in the following .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f11 ] depicts a snapshot of density ( left - half ) , entropy ( right - top ) and plasma @xmath169 ( right - bottom , the ratio of magnetic to the matter pressure ) at the final simulation time ( @xmath170 ms ) for model j0.8b11 .",
    "the high entropy regions in the slightly off - axis region ( seen as reddish in the top right panel ) correspond to the magnetohydrodynamically - driven outflows that are pushed outwards by the twisted toroidal magnetic fields ( also seen as reddish in the bottom right panel , indicated by `` toroidal '' ) .",
    "the right panel of figure [ f11 ] shows contributions to the total gw amplitudes ( equation ( 9 ) ) , in which the left - hand - side panels are for the sum of the hydrodynamic and gravitational part ( indicated by `` matter '' ) , namely @xmath171\\right)$ ] ( left top(@xmath172)/bottom(@xmath173 ) ( equations ( [ quad],[grav ] ) ) , and the right - hand - side panels are for the magnetic part , namely @xmath174 @xmath175 $ ] ( right top(@xmath172)/bottom(@xmath173 ) ) ( e.g. , equation ( [ mag ] ) ) . by comparing the top two panels",
    ", it can be seen that the positive contribution is overlapped with the regions where the mhd outflows exist .",
    "the major positive contribution is from the kinetic term of the mhd outflows with large radial velocities ( e.g. , @xmath176 in equation ( [ quad ] ) ) .",
    "the magnetic part also contributes to the positive trend ( see top right - half in the right panel ( labeled by mag(+ ) ) ) .",
    "this comes from the toroidal magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xmath177 in equation ( [ mag ] ) ) , which dominantly contribute to drive mhd explosions .",
    "unfortunately , our mhd code becomes numerically unstable when the strong mhd jets propagate to a stellar mantle with decreasing density , which prevents us from studying the resulting gws in more long run .",
    "the neutrino gws are much smaller than the other gw sources ( e.g. , figure [ f10 ] ) ) simply due to the shorter simulation time .",
    "we expect that the increasing trends by the magnetic fields maintain as the mhd shocks propagate further out ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to confirm it , we need to implement a numerical technique specially developed to solve the force - free fields , which is major undertaking ( e.g. , @xcite ) .     but for model j0.8b11 .",
    "the pink line represents the gws from magnetic fields ( @xmath178 in equation ( [ total ] ) ) . ]",
    "541 ms . in the left panel , the logarithmic density ( in@xmath123 , left - half ) , entropy(@xmath179/baryon , right top ) , and the ratio of magnetic to the matter pressure ( right bottom ) are shown .",
    "right panel shows the sum of the hydrodynamic and gravitational parts ( indicated by `` matter '' in the left - hand side ) and the magnetic part ( indicated by `` mag '' in the right - hand side ) , respectively .",
    "the top and bottom panels represent the positive and negative contribution ( indicated by ( + ) or ( - ) ) to @xmath154 , respectively ( see text for more detail ) ]     is the characteristic gravitational wave strain defined in @xcite .",
    "note that the frequency domain larger than @xmath180 hz is only plotted , since the typical timescale that our simulations covered is 10 s.,title=\"fig : \" ]   is the characteristic gravitational wave strain defined in @xcite .",
    "note that the frequency domain larger than @xmath180 hz is only plotted , since the typical timescale that our simulations covered is 10 s.,title=\"fig : \" ]      finally , figure [ f14 ] depicts the gw spectra for models j0.8 ( left ) and j1.0 ( right ) .",
    "the gw spectra in the frequency domain between 1 to 100 hz becomes slightly larger for model j0.8 than for model j1.0 .",
    "this reflects a more efficient release of the gravitational binding energy for the moderately rotating case ( model j0.8 ) as already mentioned in sections 3.2 and 3.4 .",
    "for the cosmological distance scale of grbs ( @xmath181 mpc ) , these low frequency gw signals are unfortunately very hard to detect even by the advanced detectors ( like the advanced ligo or kagra / lcgt ) whose sensitivity is severely limited by the seismic noises @xcite .",
    "a good news is that these signals could be detectable by a recently proposed future space - based interferometer like fabry - perot type decigo ( @xcite , black line in figure [ f14 ] ) .",
    "two low - luminosity lgrbs were already observed at distances of @xmath182 mpc ( 980425 , @xcite ) and @xmath183 mpc ( 060218 , @xcite ) .",
    "and their local rate , being much higher than that of normal bursts , is expected to be as large @xmath184 with @xmath185 representing the distance normalized by 100 mpc ( see discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that the gw astronomy of collapsars could become reality by the decigo - class gw detectors , hopefully near in the future .",
    "by performing axisymmetric srmhd simulations , we investigated possible signatures of gws in the context of the collapsar model of lgrbs . by cutting out the central bh , we focused on the gws generated by asphericities in neutrino emission and matter motions in the vicinity of the hyperaccreting disks .",
    "nine models were computed by changing initial angular momenta and magnetic fields parametrically in the precollapse core of a @xmath0 progenitor star . as for the microphysics ,",
    "a realistic equation of state was employed and the neutrino cooling was taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme . to accurately estimate gws from neutrinos",
    ", we performed a ray - tracing analysis in gr by a post - processing procedure .",
    "we studied also the effects of magnetic fields on the gravitational waveforms by employing a stress formula that includes contributions both from magnetic fields and special relativistic corrections .",
    "we found that the gw amplitudes from anisotropic neutrino emission shows a monotonic increase with time , whose amplitudes are much larger than those from matter motions of the accreting material .",
    "we showed that the increasing trend of the neutrino gws stems from the excess of neutrino emission in the direction near parallel to the spin axis illuminated from the hyperaccreting disks .",
    "we pointed out that a recently proposed future space interferometer like fabry - perot type decigo would permit the detection of these signals within @xmath1 100 mpc .    here",
    "it should be noted that our 2d simulations can not capture any non - axisymmetric instabilities so far proposed to provide a strong gw emission in the semi - analytical ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in full gr simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the present results might be regarded to give a lower limit for the possible gw emission in collapsars . to go up the ladders beyond the 2d simulations",
    "is very numerical challenging , however , we need to handle it not only to test the outcomes of the proposed ideas about the non - axisymmetric instabilities but also to obtain more accurate waveforms from collapsars .",
    "when studying the formation of bhs and the associated gw signals , the use of a pseudo - newtonian potential can lead to significant errors .",
    "this is the reason why we had to limit our discussion only to the asphericities and the resulting gw emission in the vicinity of the accretion disk which is far away from the central object . in studying the dynamics from core - collapse to neutron star , a conformally - flat - condition ( cfc ) approximation",
    "has been often employed to solve the gr equations @xcite .",
    "and it has been tested that such a treatment is very good in capturing the results of full - gr results ( e.g. , @xcite ) for a wide variety of supernova progenitors with neutron star formations .",
    "but it may need a further investigation that the approximation is still valid in applying to collapsars which is a highly aspherical disk - bh system with very dilute polar funnel regions along the rotational axis .",
    "full gr simulations ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) are indeed one of the most important topics pointing to the final frontiers of stellar core - collapse simulations , however , it is generally computationally too expensive at present to follow the late - time collapsar evolution up to @xmath18610 s , which is a typical duration of long - duration grbs . moreover",
    "the inclusion of microphysics such as neutrino heating is a major undertaking for the full gr simulations . the cowling approximation ( or the fixed metric approach , e.g. , @xcite ) has been often used in collapsar simulations so far .",
    "but it still remains a non - trivial issue how to treat the self - gravity of the accretion disk .",
    "finally , the pseudo - newtonian approach we take in this work can not unambiguously capture accurate properties of the flows in the vicinity of the bh as well as the associated gw signals .",
    "sacrificing the central regions , such simplified method would be currently only a possible way to follow a long - term evolution ( especially for the disk evolution ) with including an appropriate treatment of microphysics .",
    "needless to say , these four approaches ( full gr , cfc , cowling , and post - newtonian ) may be regarded to be complimentary useful to study the different epochs in the collapsar evolution . for bridging the gaps between them , it may be a good idea to employ the end results of fully gr simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) in our simulation , which we consider to be the most urgent task to investigate as a sequel of this study .",
    "in a data analysis to extract the true gw signals from the confusing detector noises , it should be of primary importance to take a coincident analysis with the conventional electromagnetic observation as well as neutrinos . what could be the photon and neutrino signatures in our collapsar models ? to answer this question ,",
    "we need to perform a long - term simulation that bridges continuously the phase 2 and 3 as mentioned in the introduction . for generating neutrino - driven or mhd - driven outflows in numerical simulations of collapsars ,",
    "the grmhd simulations including the effects of the neutrino heating are needed , the formulation of which is in a steady progress ( e.g. , @xcite ) . assisted by a growing computational power , these advanced simulations would be hopefully practicable by utilizing the next - generation supercomputers .",
    "these updates should bring forward not only our understanding the dynamics of the collapsar engines , but also the theoretical predictions of observable multi - messengers ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , including neutrino emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) and nucleosynthetic yields ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the neutrino signals emitted from our collapsar models ( e.g. , from figure [ f2 ] with its typical emergent neutrino energy of @xmath187 mev ) are visible up to the local group ( @xmath188 mpc , kawagoe et al . in preparation ) by future megaton - class detectors ( e.g. , hyper - kamiokande , memphys , and lbne ) , large - scale scintillators ( e.g. , halo @xcite , and by liquid - argon detectors ( glacier , see @xcite for collective references therein ) .",
    "while this work might raise many more questions than it can answer , it definitely makes clear that our understanding of the gws in collapsars is still in its infancy and that collapsars and the bh - forming supernovae are `` gold mine '' in which a number of unsettled and fascinating research themes are hidden .",
    "we hope that our exploratory results , at least , give momentum to theorists to make the gw prediction based on a more sophisticated numerical modeling of collapsars .",
