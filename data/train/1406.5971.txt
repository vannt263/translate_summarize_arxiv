    "in recent years , there has been a growing interest in designing and manufacturing new materials with nano and microparticles having specifically tailored morphologies , such as core - shell and hollow structures @xcite",
    ". a particularly interesting morphology refers to yolk - shell particles , in which a hollow shell carries a smaller particle in its interior @xcite .",
    "nanostructures of this type can be synthesized for application in various fields such as nanoreactors @xcite , lithium - ion batteries @xcite , biomedical imaging@xcite , catalysis@xcite , and energy storage devices @xcite .",
    "an essential aspect of the technological use of yolk - shell systems refers to the understanding of their structural and dynamic properties in terms of the yolk - yolk , yolk - shell , and shell - shell direct interaction forces .",
    "for example , besides the obvious steric forces that keep a yolk inside its shell , in concentrated samples one may have to consider the interactions between yolk - shell complexes . a basic and elementary question , for example",
    ", refers to the effect of the yolk - shell interaction on the brownian motion of the complex , as exhibited by the difference between the brownian motion of an empty shell , and of a shell carrying its yolk .",
    "a second question refers to the effects of the interactions between yolk - shell complexes on the individual and collective diffusion of interacting yolk - shell complexes .    as a first step to address these questions , in this work we consider a simple model representation of this class of materials , namely , a monodisperse colloidal suspension formed by @xmath2 rigid spherical shell particles of outer ( inner ) diameter @xmath3 in a volume @xmath4 , each of which bears one smaller ( `` yolk '' ) rigid particle of diameter @xmath5 ) diffusing in its interior .",
    "here we perform brownian dynamics simulations to describe how the mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath6 ^ 2>/6 $ ] and the self - intermediate scattering function ( self - isf ) @xmath7 } \\right\\rangle $ ] of tagged yolk - shell particles are influenced by the combined effect of the interaction of the shells with their own yolks and with the other shells , as we vary the concentration @xmath8 of yolk - shell particles .",
    "we then interpret the results in terms of a model liquid of effective interacting shells , whose brownian motion is `` renormalized '' by a time - dependent added friction that results from averaging over the yolks degrees of freedom .",
    "this interpretation is developed in the framework of the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics , which is adapted here to the context of a suspension of brownian yolk - shell particles .",
    "as our fundamental starting point , let us consider a model monodisperse yolk - shell colloidal suspension formed by @xmath2 spherical shell particles in a volume @xmath4 , each bearing one smaller yolk particle diffusing in its interior .",
    "let us neglect hydrodynamic interactions and denote by @xmath9 and @xmath10 the position and velocity of the center of mass of the @xmath11th shell ( @xmath12 ) or yolk ( @xmath13 ) particle .",
    "let us denote by @xmath14 and @xmath15 the mass of , respectively , the shell and the yolk particles , and by @xmath16 and @xmath17 their respective short - time friction coefficients .",
    "then the postulated microscopic dynamics of these @xmath18 brownian particles is described by the following @xmath18 langevin equations , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . in these equations",

    "these forces are assumed to be pairwise additive and determined by the radially symmetric pair potentials @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 describing , respectively , the shell - shell , shell - yolk , and yolk - yolk direct interactions . for concreteness , here we shall have in mind a yolk - shell model in which the yolks only interact with their own shells , so that @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , the specific case analyzed below will involve purely repulsive hard - body interactions , defined by the conditions @xmath37=h ( r-\\sigma_{s})$ ] and @xmath38=h ( ( \\sigma_{in } - \\sigma_y)/2-r)$ ] , where @xmath39 is heaviside s step function and @xmath40 .",
    "our brownian dynamics simulations consist essentially of the numerical solution of the overdamped version of these @xmath18 stochastic langevin equations , in which one neglects the inertial terms @xmath41 $ ] , according to the algorithm proposed by ermak and mccammon @xcite .",
    "we have used this algorithm in the efficient , low - memory version proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the dynamic properties of the system above .",
    "the results will be employed to assess the numerical accuracy of the statistical mechanical description provided by the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics @xcite , adapted here to the context of a suspension of brownian yolk - shell particles .",
    "this theory also starts from the same microscopic dynamics represented by the @xmath18 langevin equations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , but its general strategy is to first average out the degrees of freedom of the yolk particles , which is equivalent to `` solving '' eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath42 , i.e. , for the positions and velocities of the yolk particles , and substituting the solution in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath22 .",
    "such procedure , detailed elsewhere @xcite , yields the following set of @xmath2 `` renormalized '' langevin equations involving the positions and velocities of only the shell particles @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where now @xmath45 only involves shell - shell interactions and the random force @xmath46 has zero mean and variance given by @xmath47\\delta _ { ij}{\\bf i}$ ] . within a reasonable set of approximations ,",
    "the time - dependent friction function @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 ^ 2",

    "the second stage in this strategy is to start from this set of @xmath2 renormalized langevin equations to derive a microscopically - based description of the macroscopic dynamic properties of the yolk - shell brownian liquid .",
    "we do this by adequately extending the scgle theory of colloid dynamics . omitting the details of the derivations and approximations ,",
    "the end result is a set of three coupled approximate equations .",

    "1(a ) is intended to illustrate two effects in a simple manner .",
    "the first is the effect of yolk - shell interactions , which is illustrated by the comparison of the circles , representing the msd @xmath92 of freely diffusing yolk - shell particles , and the dotted line , representing the msd @xmath93 of freely diffusing _ empty _ shells .",
    "the deviation of the simulation data from @xmath94 is a measure of the additional friction effects upon the displacement of the yolk - shell complex due to the yolk - shell interaction .",
    "the solid line that lies near the circles represents the prediction of our scgle theory .",
    "the first conclusion that we can draw from this comparison is that the scgle - predicted deviation of @xmath92 from @xmath94 , coincides very satisfactorily with the deviation observed in the bd data .    the second effect illustrated by fig .",
    "1(a ) involves the dynamic asymmetry parameter .",
    "the next conclusion to draw from the results in this figure is that the deviation of @xmath95 from @xmath94 increases when the dynamic contrast parameter @xmath83 decreases .",
    "this is illustrated by the comparison of the bd simulations corresponding to @xmath80 ( triangles ) with the bd data corresponding to @xmath96 ( circles ) .",
    "this means , for example , that if the interior of the shell becomes more viscous , so that the ratio @xmath83 decreases , then also the overall diffusivity of the yolk - shell particle will decrease . as evidenced by the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ wdt1](a ) , this trend is also predicted by the scgle theory and shows good quantitative agreement with the simulation data . in fact , our theory predicts , and the simulations corroborate , that this trend is reversed when one considers the opposite limit , in which @xmath83 is now larger than 1 .",
    "this trend is best illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ wdt1](a ) , which exhibits the measured ( circles ) and predicted ( solid line ) dependence on @xmath83 of the scaled long - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath97 , obtained as @xmath98 .",
    "there we can see that the reduction of the mobility @xmath99 from its unit value @xmath100 , in the absence of yolks , may be considerable .",
    "for example , for @xmath80 we have that @xmath101 . as a reference , a reduction in @xmath102 of a similar magnitude",
    "can also be produced as a result of pure shell - shell interactions , but only at shell volume fractions above 40% , as gathered from the results of the inset in fig .",
    "1(b ) , which discusses the effects of shell - shell interactions .",
    "let us now study the effects of shell - shell interactions , suppressed in the previous discussion , by analyzing the results of our simulations in fig .",
    "1(b ) , in which we now fix the dynamic asymmetry parameter at the value @xmath103 .",
    "the circles in this figure represent the bd results for the msd @xmath104 of yolk - shell particles at a volume fraction @xmath73 .",
    "these results are to be compared with the squares , which correspond to the bd results for the msd @xmath105 of a liquid of empty shells ( or solid hard - spheres ) at the same volume fraction and same short - time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "the msd @xmath106 of freely - diffusing empty shells is also plotted for reference as a dotted line .",
    "we observe that the deviation of @xmath104 from @xmath105 remains rather similar to the corresponding deviation observed at @xmath91 in fig .",
    "1(a ) ( where @xmath107 ) , but now both @xmath104 and @xmath105 deviate dramatically from this free - diffusion limit .",
    "this means that for this concentration , the mutual friction effects due to shell - shell interactions overwhelm the `` internal '' friction effects caused by yolk - shell interactions .    from the long - time bd data for @xmath104 and @xmath105 in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we can extract the value of @xmath108 and @xmath102 , which represent the mobility of a tracer yolk - shell particle and of an empty shell , respectively . in the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) , we plot the values of @xmath108 and @xmath102 ( circles and squares , respectively ) determined from the corresponding bd results at a few volume fractions .",
    "this inset thus summarizes the main trends illustrated by the results in figs 1.a and 1.b , by evidencing that at low volume fractions the difference between the mobility of a yolk - shell complex and the mobility of an empty shell , is determined only by the yolk - shell friction , whereas at higher concentrations it is dominated by the shell - shell interactions .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "1(b ) represent again the predictions of the scgle theory for the properties of the yolk - shell system , whereas the dashed lines are the corresponding predictions for the empty - shell ( or hard - sphere ) suspension .",
    "once again , the agreement with the simulation results is also quite reasonable for a theory with no adjustable parameters .    beyond this quantitative observation",
    ", however , the theoretical description provides additional insights on the interpretation of the qualitative trends exhibited by the simulation data of the long - time self - diffusion coefficients @xmath108 and @xmath102 .",
    "for example , it is not difficult to demonstrate that if the shell - shell mutual friction @xmath109 does not depend strongly on the presence or absence of the yolk ( which one expects to be the case at high concentrations ) , then an approximate relationship between @xmath108 and @xmath102 can be derived , namely , @xmath110}.\\ ] ] where @xmath111^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath112 .",
    "this expression interpolates @xmath108 between its exact low and high concentration limits @xmath113 and @xmath102 , and the dot - dashed line in the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) is the result of using this approximate expression .",
    "the bd simulations and the scgle theory provide other relevant collective and self diffusion dynamic properties , such as the intermediate scattering functions , specially amenable to determination by dynamic light scattering techniques and adequate index - matching methods . to close this illustrative presentation ,",
    "let us discuss the bd results in fig .",
    "3.c for the self - isf @xmath114 ( circles ) , which we compare with the self - isf @xmath115 of a liquid of empty - shells at the same volume fraction ( squares ) . for reference ,",
    "we also plot as a dotted line the self - isf @xmath116 of freely - diffusing empty shells . here too , the solid and dashed lines correspond to the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ dzdty4s])-([lambdadkuniform ] ) with and without the shell friction term @xmath117 , and comparison again indicates very reasonable agreement with the simulation data .    in this case",
    ", the difference between the yolk - shell and empty - shell results can also be expressed more economically in terms of the corresponding @xmath118-relaxation times @xmath119 , defined by the condition @xmath120 and scaled as @xmath121 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "1(c ) exhibits the theoretical ( solid line ) and simulated ( circles ) results for the yolk - shell @xmath122 evaluated at @xmath123 for @xmath103 as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "these results may be compared with the theoretical ( dashed line ) and simulated ( squares ) results for @xmath124 , corresponding to the empty - shell suspension , with similar conclusions as in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in analogy with the relationship in eq .",
    "( [ dleyhs ] ) , from the scgle equations one can also derive an approximate relationship between @xmath122 and @xmath125 , namely , @xmath126 .",
    "this prediction of the value of @xmath122 has a rather modest quantitative accuracy , as indicated by the dot - dashed line in the inset .",
    "still , it contributes to a simple and correct qualitative understanding of the main features of the properties of the yolk - shell system being studied .    in summary , in this work we have carried out bd simulations and have proposed a statistical mechanical approach for describing the dynamic properties of a complex system , namely , a concentrated suspension of yolk - shell particles .",
    "here we have discussed the simplest illustrative model representation , in which each shell carries only a single yolk , and in which the yolk - shell and shell - shell forces are model as purely repulsive , hard - body interactions .",
    "this implied an additional simplification , namely , the absence of yolk - yolk direct interactions .",
    "these simplifications allowed us to reach a reasonable understanding of the differences between a yolk - shell system and a suspension of empty shell , and of the main trends observed upon the variation of relevant parameters , such as the short - time dynamic asymmetry parameter @xmath83 or the shell volume fraction @xmath85 .",
    "the message , however , is that the theoretical approach presented here can be extended to consider other , more complex conditions , such as including more than one yolks per shell and studying the effects of yolk - shell and shell - shell interactions beyond the purely repulsive , hard - core  like interactions considered here .",
