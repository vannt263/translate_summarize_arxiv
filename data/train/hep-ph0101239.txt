    "the study of the origin of electro - weak symmetry breaking and the exploration of the higgs sector is one of the main themes of the @xmath0 linear collider ( lc ) physics programme .",
    "a distinctive feature of several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , such as its minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) , is the introduction of an extra higgs doublet resulting in five physical higgs boson states , two of which are charged @xmath7 . while the existence of an extended higgs sector may be indirectly revealed by a detailed study of the production and decay properties of the lightest neutral higgs boson @xmath8  @xcite , its direct manifestation will only come from the detection of pairs of heavier higgs particles , such as @xmath9 .",
    "we report the results of a study of the sensitivity of a 800  gev @xmath0 lc , such as tesla  @xcite , for the detection of pair produced heavy charged higgs bosons .",
    "the @xmath9 production cross section depends , at tree level , only on the boson mass , @xmath10 , while the dominant @xmath7 decay mode depends on the model parameters that may modify the higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "there have been some earlier studies of @xmath11 reconstruction at the lc for the case of a rather light boson , decaying predominantly into a @xmath12 quark pair  @xcite .",
    "this study has considered the two decay processes @xmath13 , expected to be dominant in the mssm with @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , leading to the same final state consisting of two @xmath3 bosons and four @xmath4 quarks , for the cases of heavier bosons , with @xmath10 = 200 and 300  gev/@xmath5 and @xmath17 = 115  gev/@xmath5 .    by selecting hadronic @xmath3 decays , the complete reconstruction of the resulting eight jet final states allows to determine the @xmath7 mass , profiting of the intermediate @xmath18 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath3 mass constraints , the production cross section and the decay branching fractions .",
    "accurate values for the mass and the decay branching ratios may contribute to fix some of the model parameters .",
    "recent calculations of higher order corrections to the production cross section have shown a significant model dependence  @xcite that may be useful for discriminating between models , provided an accurate experimental determination of the cross section is possible at the lc .",
    "the results reported here have been obtained from a simulation study for 500  @xmath19 of integrated luminosity at @xmath20 = 800  gev .",
    "the signal and backgrounds events have been generated with pythia  6  @xcite , including initial state radiation and accounting for the beamstrahlung effect computed for the tesla parameters",
    "the generated events have been passed through the parametric simdet detector simulation  @xcite .",
    "the signal cross section depends strongly on the charged higgs boson mass , varying from @xmath21  @xmath22 for 200  gev/@xmath5 to @xmath23  @xmath22 for 300  gev/@xmath5 corresponding to @xmath24@xmath25 @xmath11 pairs/500",
    "fb@xmath6 . this abundant production at a high luminosity lc ,",
    "allows to enforce tight requirements on the event preselection and the mass reconstruction .",
    "most two and four fermion background processes can be effectively rejected by requiring eight jets and four @xmath4 quarks , despite their large production cross sections . the @xmath26 background which results in multi - jet final state with @xmath4 quarks",
    "can be reduced by the both @xmath4 tagging and the mass kinematical fits .",
    "genuine @xmath27 final states , as those originating from the higgs radiation off the top quark process @xmath28 , remain the largest source of background with an estimated cross section of 3  fb which has been reduced in this analysis by a kinematical fit .    to select fully hadronic events , the visible energy of the reconstructed tracks and calorimetric clusters has been required to be above 600  gev , the missing momentum below 100  gev/@xmath29 and the energy of the most energetic lepton below 50  gev .",
    "the hadronic system has been clustered into jets , using the camjet algorithm  @xcite , varying the @xmath30 value from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "only those events giving eight reconstructed jets , for a @xmath30 value in this range , have been further considered .",
    "four out of the eight jets have been required to be @xmath4 tagged . in this analysis a parametrized @xmath4 tagging response , corresponding to 90% tagging efficiency with 5% mis - identification probability , has been used .",
    "in order to efficiently distinguish the signal charged higgs production from the underlying backgrounds and to measure the boson mass , it is important to obtain a clean higgs signal in the mass distribution of the multi - jet final states .",
    "the two decay hypotheses @xmath33 and @xmath34 have been considered .",
    "events fulfilling the above selection criteria have been tested for the presence of two @xmath3 decaying into non-@xmath4 tagged jets .",
    "each @xmath18 quark has then been reconstructed from a @xmath3 candidate paired with a @xmath4 tagged jet , in the case of the @xmath35 while for the case of @xmath36 , each @xmath37 decay has been reconstructed from tagged @xmath38 pairs . to further reject backgrounds as well as poorly reconstructed signal events , leading to an inaccurate measurement of @xmath10 , the compatibility of the mass of the jet combination to that of @xmath39 and @xmath8 bosons and the top quark within the measurement accuracy has been required . after completing the jet assignment , a kinematical fit , imposing energy and momentum conservation , the mass of intermediate states and equal higgs boson masses , has been applied .",
    "this fit improves the signal mass reconstruction from by a factor of two for @xmath10 = 300  gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting fit @xmath40 has also been used to further reject background events and to distinguish between the two signal decay channels under study , based on the hypothesis giving the best @xmath40 value .",
    "after applying these reconstruction and selection criteria , signal efficiencies in the range 2%-4% , according to the charged higgs boson mass and adopted @xmath40 cut value , has been obtained with a high signal purity . with a data set of 500  fb@xmath6 at @xmath20 = 800  gev ,",
    "these correspond to signal samples of 150 - 600 events , with @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding statistical accuracies on the measurements of the boson mass and the production cross section are summarized in table  1 .",
    ".statistical accuracy on the determination of the mass and production cross section for a charged higgs boson at @xmath20 = 800  gev with 500  fb@xmath6 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the low level of background achieved , the sensitivity to a charged higgs pair production is guaranteed up to @xmath42 350  gev/@xmath5 , where the cross section falls below 5  fb , due to the @xmath43 suppression , reducing the number of signal events below the detection threshold at a @xmath20 = 800  gev collider .",
    "the full reconstruction of the charged higgs boson @xmath1 and @xmath44 multi - jet final states has been studied for a sample of @xmath0 lc data at @xmath20 = 800  gev with @xmath10 = 200 and 300  gev/@xmath5 .",
    "statistical accuracies of 1  gev/@xmath5 on the boson mass and of 10% on its production cross sections have been obtained .",
    "these results can provide significant information about the parameters of an extended higgs sector in the mssm or in other sm extensions ."
