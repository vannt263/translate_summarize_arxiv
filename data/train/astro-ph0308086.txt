    "past studies of temporary reduction of mass - transfer rates in cvs mostly focused on episodes with long time scales ( usually @xmath0100 d ) .",

    "@xcite even suggested that rx and is a transitional object between z cam - type dwarf novae and vy scl - type stars ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although @xcite reported difference between fadings in rx and and in vy scl - type stars .",
    "@xcite examined the historical light curve of rx and and reported that typical fadings of rx and lasted for @xmath2100 d.    here we report on the detection of an unusually short fading episode in 2002 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : rx ] shows the light curve covering this event starting at around jd 2452570 .",
    "the errors of visual observations are usually less than 0.3 mag , which do not affect the discussion . about 34 d after reaching a temporary minimum , the object underwent a short , small brightening ( jd 2452582 ) .",
    "this behavior is remarkably similar to a small brightening when rx and entered a long faint state in 1996 ( figure [ fig : rx ] , lower panel ) .",
    "such behavior is just what is expected for a thermally stable accretion disk suffering from a sudden decrease of the mass - transfer rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore identify the 2002 phenomenon as an extremely short fading episode .",
    "the recovery from this fading took less than 30 d ( figure [ fig : rx ] , upper panel ) .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)fig1.eps    no similarly short fading episode was identified in @xcite , although there was a slight indication of a short fading around jd 2449300 .",
    "no other similar event has been recorded since the firm establishment in 1996 of the fading phenomenon in rx and . from these findings ,",
    "such a short fading episode is extremely rare .",
    "su uma is the well - known prototype of the su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "although some irregularities in the long - term light variation has been reported ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , past studies mainly pointed out the irregularities in the supercycle ( or occurrence of superoutbursts ) and the occasional absence of normal outbursts . from the vsnet observation",
    ", we report on the detection of short fadings , which may by analogous to that of rx and ( section [ sec : rx ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : su ] shows the long - term ( 19942003 ) light curve of su uma . although the object spends most of its quiescence at around @xmath3=14.0 , there are at least two instances [ marked with the arrows : around jd 2450600 ( 1997 may ) and jd 2452680 ( 2003 february ) ] when the object was transiently observed below @xmath415.0 . during these phases ,",
    "the number of outbursts was remarkably reduced ( figure [ fig : sularge ] ) .",

    "in most vy scl - type stars , the fading episodes ( low states ) usually take much longer durations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this difference may be a result of a stronger heating effect on the accretion disk in vy scl - type stars @xcite .",
    "following the calculation by @xcite , very short events of the reduced mass - transfer in vy scl - type stars , if any , may not appear as prominent fadings since a heating can thermally stabilize the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite reported that a white dwarf temperature of 4@xmath510@xmath6 k produces ionized inner disk , thereby preventing dwarf nova - type disk instability from occurring at low mass - transfer rates , and preventing the system from immediately reaching a deep , low state .",
    "we can expect that the effect would be more obvious when the decrease of mass - transfer occurs more slowly , and when the disk surface density is close to the thermal stability .",
    "observational evidence for the suppression of the disk instability in a vy scl star , v425 cas , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the presence of a short fading episode in rx and thus might be an additional manifestation of the difference between the faint states in rx and and vy scl - type stars @xcite .    we must note that there have been , however , arguments that a heating effect rather produces small `` echo outbursts '' , which are different from the conclusion by @xcite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . following these interpretations , the small brightening ( jd 2452582 ) may be alternatively interpreted as a variety of echo outbursts . since the physical reason of the difference in simulations has not been fully clarified ,",
    "we should leave it as an open question .",
    "we must note that a similar short fading was once observed in the intermediate polar ao psc @xcite , which has been sometimes considered as a candidate vy scl - type star .",
    "the truncation of the accretion disk by the strong magnetic field of an intermediate polar may have enabled such a short fading episode observable in ao psc .",
    "the phenomenon in rx and seems to be more easily understandable with a temporary reduction in mass - transfer rate , since rx and has already shown a much longer episode of reduced mass - transfer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the exact cause of reduced mass - transfer in vy scl - type stars is not yet clarified , the starspot hypothesis @xcite would be a promising explanation .",
    "since the starspot activity is expected to be stronger in stars with higher magnetic activities , this explanation would naturally explain the high occurrence of vy scl - type stars in only in systems of long orbital periods ( @xmath7 ) , particularly in the range 3 hr@xmath8 4hr ( see @xcite for the full explanation ) .",
    "the location of rx and ( @xmath7 = 5.0 hr ) is just above this region , and the proposed mechanism would reasonably work .",
    "the long - period dwarf novae with occasional low states include ww cet ( @xmath7 = 4.2 hr , @xcite ) , although it is not clear whether these low states actually correspond to reduced mass - transfer phenomena .",
    "this explanation , however , is more difficult to apply to su uma ( section [ sec : su ] ) .",
    "since su uma is an object with @xmath7 = 1.8 hr , the secondary star is expected to become fully convective and we can not _ canonically _ expect a high magnetic activity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the first fading episode ( 1997 may ) might have a different origin .",
    "this episode was followed by a superoutburst , suggesting that the large amount of mass must have stored @xcite even during this fading . during this fading",
    ", the low quiescent brightness may have been a temporary reduction of disk viscosity which also suppressed normal outbursts @xcite , but once the thermal instability occurs , this would lead to a larger outburst ( the extreme effect would be best seen in wz sge - type stars : @xcite , @xcite ) . the second fading ( 2003 february )",
    "was not associated with similar occurrence of a superoutburst .",
    "this phenomenon may have been an episode with a true reduction of mass - transfer .",
    "if this possibility of mass - transfer reduction is confirmed , we probably need a different mechanism from that of vy scl - type stars .",
    "we must also note that some objects with @xmath7 similar to su uma are claimed to have  low states \" ( e.g. ht cas : @xmath7 = 1.8 hr , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and ir com : @xmath7 = 2.1 hr , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are also su uma - type dwarf novae with long - term variation of outburst properties ( v1159 ori : @xcite ; v503 cyg : @xcite ; dm lyr : @xcite ; mn dra = var73 dra : @xcite ) .",
    "it is not still certain whether or not variable mass - transfer rate is responsible for these phenomena in these short-@xmath7 dwarf novae .",
