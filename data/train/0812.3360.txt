    "the past few years have seen extensive investigations of the @xmath1 meson producing reactions at close to threshold energies .",
    "the experiments are aimed either at directly searching @xcite for the possible existence of eta - mesic nuclei as a result of the strong attractive nature of the @xmath1-n interaction @xcite or studying the final state eta - nuclear interaction to eventually conclude on the existence of eta - mesic nuclear states @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the data on @xmath1 production near threshold is the strong deviation of the cross sections from phase space .",
    "it can be understood as a manifestation of the strong attractive @xmath1-n interaction ( arising basically due to the proximity of the @xmath1-n threshold to the @xmath9 resonance n@xmath10(1535 ) ) .",
    "experiments on @xmath1 production have been performed in nucleon - nucleon collisions and have been extended to proton - deuteron and deuteron - deuteron collisions too @xcite . though the focus of reactions such as the p + d @xmath11 p + d + @xmath1 and @xmath12 is on investigating possibilities of bound states of eta mesons and 2 - 3 nucleon systems , theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism revealed interesting features too @xcite . in the p - d collisions ,",
    "the production near threshold is found to be dominated by a two - step mechanism where the large momentum transfer in producing the @xmath1 meson is shared by three nucleons .",
    "these findings naturally led to the curiosity of what happens when the @xmath1 interacts with more than three or four nucleons in the final nucleus . with this motivation ,",
    "measurements of the @xmath0 reaction were carried out by the turin group in 1993 @xcite at an incident energy of 683 mev .",
    "a theoretical study of this reaction along with others of the type , @xmath13 and @xmath14 was performed in @xcite .",
    "part of the emphasis of this work was on obtaining the right form factors for @xmath2li ( and @xmath2be ) and the interactions of the mesons with the nuclei in the final states were neglected .",
    "the interest in the @xmath0 reaction revived once again by the recent proposal of studying this reaction at cosy , jlich , at an incident energy of 673 mev @xcite .",
    "having performed detailed theoretical studies of the p + d @xmath11 p + d + @xmath1 and @xmath12 reactions @xcite and the @xmath1 meson interactions with the deuteron , @xmath5he and @xmath15he nuclei @xcite , we now develop a model to study the interaction of @xmath1 mesons with a @xmath5he-@xmath15he cluster , namely , the @xmath2be nucleus .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2be interaction is then incorporated in a theoretical calculation of cross sections for the @xmath0 reaction , with four possible low - lying states of the @xmath2be nucleus .",
    "an analysis of its effects on the @xmath0 cross sections presented here , should be useful in motivating further experimental studies of this reaction .",
    "based on literature which supports considering the @xmath2be nucleus as a bound state of an alpha ( @xmath15he ) and @xmath5he @xcite , we model the @xmath1-@xmath2be final state interaction in the form of a three body problem of the @xmath1-@xmath5he-@xmath15he interaction . regarding the @xmath3li too as a cluster of an alpha and a deuteron @xcite , the @xmath0 reaction is considered to proceed through the @xmath12 reaction with the @xmath4 remaining a spectator . besides , the present work focuses on the low energy region of @xmath1 production where ( a ) the @xmath12 production amplitude is large ( i.e. the p and d interact strongly to produce an @xmath1 ) and ( b ) the cluster picture of low lying levels of @xmath2be and @xmath3li is reasonably good .",
    "there exists in principle , the possibility of considering the deuteron as a spectator .",
    "however , a reaction of the type @xmath16 followed by the combination of @xmath17 and a deuteron to form the @xmath2be nucleus , does not agree with the cluster model approach here ( since @xmath2be is hardly known to be a cluster of d + @xmath18li , where @xmath18li is in fact unstable ) .",
    "the possibility of an intermediate @xmath19 reaction , with further steps of the final state @xmath20 from this reaction combining with the spectator deuteron , i.e. , @xmath21 forming a @xmath5he which eventually combines with the final state @xmath4 ( from the above reaction ) to form @xmath2be still remains .",
    "however , this is not a practical option with no information available on the @xmath22 reaction .      as mentioned above",
    ", we consider the @xmath2be nucleus as a two body system made up of a @xmath5he and @xmath15he nucleus and construct an elastic transition matrix for the three body problem of an @xmath1 meson , @xmath5he nucleus and an @xmath4 ( @xmath15he ) .",
    "the individual scattering of the @xmath1 meson on @xmath5he and @xmath4 is evaluated using the @xmath23-matrices constructed earlier by the present authors @xcite .",
    "these t - matrices are numerically evaluated using few body equations and include the off - shell rescattering of the @xmath1 on the nucleons inside @xmath5he and @xmath15he .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath5he t - matrix is tested to reproduce the @xmath12 cross section reasonably well @xcite .    to formulate the three body problem of the @xmath1-@xmath5he-@xmath15he interaction ,",
    "let us define @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be the coordinates of the @xmath5he and @xmath15he nuclei respectively , with respect to the mass-7 centre of mass system . defining the internal jacobi coordinate of the relative distance between the @xmath5he and @xmath15he nuclei as @xmath26",
    ", one can see that @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "the in - medium @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he t - matrices are written using a faddeev type decomposition @xcite , namely , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and the indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 correspond to the @xmath5he and @xmath15he t - matrices respectively .",
    "the @xmath44 s represent the single scattering terms and are the matrices for purely elastic @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he scattering .",

    ", the @xmath1-n interaction is dominated by the @xmath9 resonance n*(1535 ) and hence we perform a partial wave expansion and retain only @xmath47-waves , which reduces ( [ eta3he4he ] ) to the following two equations for @xmath1-@xmath5he ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath1-@xmath15he ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ tetan ] ) has reduced to @xmath53 written in terms of the spherical bessel functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 . replacing the equation for @xmath49 in @xmath48",
    ", we obtain a recursive relation for @xmath48 as follows , @xmath56 once @xmath48 is evaluated from ( [ eta3he ] ) , it can be replaced into the equation for @xmath49 and the two can be substituted in ( [ etabetmat ] ) to evaluate the @xmath1-@xmath2be t - matrix .",
    "thus ( [ etabetmat ] ) is evaluated retaining only @xmath47-waves in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath48 is evaluated numerically using the @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he t - matrices , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , as inputs . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are themselves evaluated numerically using few body equations and an input coupled channel @xmath1-n t - matrix .",
    "details of this formalism can be found in @xcite .",
    "the two models of the elementary @xmath59 t - matrix used here will be discussed in the next subsection .      the coupled channel @xmath1-n t - matrix which is required for the evaluation of the @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he t - matrices , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , is taken from two different models available in literature . in @xcite , a transition matrix including the @xmath60n and @xmath1n channels with the n*(1535 ) resonance playing a dominant role was constructed .",
    "it consisted of the meson - n * vertices and the n * propagator as given below : @xmath61 with , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 @xmath64 are the self energy contributions from the @xmath65 and @xmath59 loops .",
    "in @xcite elastic and inelastic @xmath1-deuteron scattering as well as @xmath1 photoproduction on the deuteron was studied using this @xmath59 model .",
    "we shall use two parameter sets available , one which leads to a scattering length of @xmath66 = ( 0.75 , 0.27 ) fm and another which leads to @xmath66 = ( 0.88 , 0.41 ) fm .",
    "we shall refer to this model henceforth as model a.    model b used in the present work is taken from @xcite .",
    "the t - matrix for @xmath67 is written in a separable form as , @xmath68 where the on - shell part , @xmath69 , is described in an effective range approximation as , @xmath70 the off - shell form factors have the form , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the length parameter in this model .",
    "the parameter sets in this model are obtained from a fit to the @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 data .",
    "the parameters required in eqs .",
    "( [ green1 ] ) and ( [ green2 ] ) above can be found in @xcite .",
    "we choose four parameter sets with @xmath59 scattering lengths of ( 0.88,0.25 ) fm , ( 0.77 , 0.25 ) fm , ( 0.51,0.26 ) fm and ( 0.4 , 0.3 ) fm .      the choice of kinematic variables in a multiple scattering formalism where the many body scattering matrix is written in terms of a two body matrix is not unique in literature .",
    "the two most commonly used approaches are ( i ) the fixed scatterer approximation ( fsa ) and ( ii ) the on - energy shell impulse approximation ( oei ) @xcite ( related to yet another approach , namely , the fixed impulse approximation ( fia ) @xcite ) . the difference between these approaches ( which becomes important at intermediate and high energies ) lies in the fact that in the fsa , the struck nucleon is assumed to recoil with the target as a whole , while in the oei , it recoils freely .",
    "this means that in the fsa , the two - body operator does not follow from the equation for a free two - body t - matrix , but rather contains the mass of the nucleus ( in which the two - body system is embedded ) in the kinetic energy .",
    "though this seems to be mathematically sound , such a two body t - matrix can have physically undesired features .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was found from a phase shift study that such a two - body t - matrix may not display the resonant behaviour which it would be expected to . in the same work , in connection with @xmath60-nucleus scattering , it was found that considering a free two - body matrix simulated the contribution of continuum states ( otherwise neglected in that work ) and brought theory in closer agreement with data .    though the differences arising from the particular approaches used above may not be crucial at the low energies considered in the present work , the many - body problem considered here is a bit more complicated and hence a small discussion is in order . in the works mentioned above ,",
    "one studies the differences of the approaches involved , in a multiple scattering of a hadron on the individual nucleons in the nuclear target .",
    "here however , the problem appears to be that of one multiple scattering problem embedded inside another .",
    "the @xmath1 mesons scatter off the @xmath5he and @xmath15he nuclei as in a three body multiple scattering problem ( of the @xmath1-@xmath5he-@xmath15he system ) .",
    "however , the individual @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he scatterings are represented by t - matrices for the multiple scatterings of the @xmath1 on the three and four nucleons inside @xmath5he and @xmath15he .",
    "we choose then to work in a framework where we start by evaluating the momenta @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the @xmath1-@xmath2be centre of mass frame and then evaluate the individual @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he t - matrices at a lorentz boosted energy - momentum in the @xmath1-@xmath5he and @xmath1-@xmath15he centre of mass systems .",
    "the energy in the in - medium propagators ( inside @xmath2be ) is however taken to be in the @xmath1-@xmath2be centre of mass system .",
    "since the energy spacing between the first four low - lying levels of the @xmath79 nucleus is small , we include the contribution from these four levels .",
    "we consider the angular momentum states with @xmath80 and @xmath81 corresponding to the @xmath82 and @xmath83 levels respectively .",
    "the cluster wave functions for @xmath2be and those for @xmath3li required in the production amplitude of the @xmath0 reaction are ( 1 ) generated using a wood - saxon potential @xcite and ( 2 ) taken from a green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) variational calculation with the urbana potential @xcite . in the gfmc case , the wave function for @xmath2li is used to represent the @xmath2be one .",
    "the @xmath4 and deuteron cluster in @xmath3li is assumed to be in the @xmath84 state .",
    "assuming that the beam proton interacts with a loosely bound deuteron in the @xmath3li nucleus to produce an @xmath1 meson and @xmath5he ( with the @xmath4 remaining a spectator ) the production amplitude for the @xmath0 reaction can be written in terms of that for the @xmath12 process .",

    "the form factor enters ( [ prodtmat1 ] ) via ( [ equation8 ] ) as ( [ prodtmat2 ] ) is simplified to ( [ equation8 ] ) due to the neglect of the fermi motion in the @xmath118 t - matrix .",
