    "instead we will study the effect of coherence on the reaction kinetics for a constant magnetic field with an earth - strength intensity ( approximately 50  @xmath5 t ) .",
    "we now briefly run through the basic principle of operation for the radical - pair reaction in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] : the radical pair is assumed to be created in a spin singlet state @xmath0 from some initial state of cryptochrome @xmath2 at a rate of @xmath1",
    ". the singlet state can then 1 ) decay to the singlet product ( i.e.  return to the initial state ) with rate @xmath6 , 2 ) decay to the triplet product @xmath4 at rate @xmath7 , or 3 ) convert coherently to the spin triplet state @xmath8 at rate @xmath3 .",
    "the physical origin of the coherent interconversion between @xmath0 and @xmath8 comes from the hyperfine interactions internal to the radical - pair system . under the application of an external magnetic field",
    "this coherent switching can be modulated by the zeeman interaction which is sensitive to both the direction and magnitude of the applied field .",
    "note the transition to the singlet product is spin - forbidden from the triplet state , only the singlet state is allowed to recombine to the singlet product but the triplet product can be reached from either the singlet or triplet state .",
    "this means that a magnetic field which enhances the coherent conversion of the radical pair from its singlet state to the triplet state will tend to increase the triplet yield ( the amount of triplet products ) whereas a magnetic field that reduces the singlet - triplet coherence tends to diminish the triplet yield .",
    "this renders the triplet yield ( and hence the overall reaction ) sensitive to an applied magnetic field .",
    "this means the various rates in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] are in general functions of the applied field and the rates that we will use in this paper correspond to a magnetic field in a given direction and intensity .    in part",
    "i we focused mainly on the recombination process of the radical - pair reaction and its decoherent effect on the spin coherence of the radical pair ( recall that the recombination process is the mechanism responsible for turning the radical pair into the products ) . although modelling additional decoherent processes such as the g - anisotropy of ref .",
    "@xcite was considered ( see sec .",
    "v.  a of part i ) , its actual effect on the chemical reaction was never studied in detail .",
    "it is the intention of the present paper to study the effect of dephasing in the radical - pair reaction by using the dephasing map introduced in part i. however , we do not attribute the dephasing to any physical mechanism , instead , we shall consider the dephasing strength to be a variable that we can tune .",
    "this allows us to study the quantum and classical limits of the reaction in the presence of recombination .",
    "the quantum limit then corresponds to setting the dephasing strength to zero , while the classical limit corresponds to setting the dephasing strength to its maximum value .",
    "we will find the radical - pair population to exhibit oscillations characteristic of coherent quantum evolution ( or rabi oscillations ) for low enough dephasing strengths and that this oscillation becomes weaker as we increase the amount of dephasing .",
    "this allows us to judge whether a classical rate - equation model is sufficient for capturing the population dynamics , or if a quantum model is really necessary for a given set of intermediate transition rates and dephasing strength .",
    "however , the radical - pair population is not the only quantity that is sensitive to coherences .",
    "it is well known from quantum - walk theory that the time for the walk to reach a preassigned state also depends on the amount of coherence one can establish between different sites in the walk .",
    "this time is known as the hitting time @xcite ( also known as the time of first passage in stochastic processes @xcite ) and we will also look at how this changes as we vary the amount of dephasing in the radical pair . in the context of a chemical reaction this time can be taken as a measure of the time required for the reaction to happen and we find this to be essentially independent of the coherence in the radical pair due to the presence of a rate - limiting step @xcite .",
    "this means that the hitting time is only an interesting quantity to consider in the absence of such a rate - limiting step and we will suggest a problem in which this is the case in the conclusion of our paper .",

    "this gives @xmath63 we make a few important remarks on our quantum - walk model in the following .",
    "1 .   following from part",
    "i we see that as long as @xmath28 is small the propagation of @xmath64 according to will be insensitive to the order of the various maps in . in discrete time",
    "this can be proven rigorously using the lie - trotter formula @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to using what is known as the zassenhaus formula in the case of pure states and neglecting terms on the order of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath28 should be small compared to all the rates in the system .",
    "all coherences ( off - diagonal elements in @xmath30 ) are zero except for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for any initial state which is diagonal .",
    "this is because only @xmath68 appears in and this is the only part in @xmath62 that is capable of creating coherences beween states corresponding to its two subscripts .",
    "although the maps @xmath69 and @xmath70 do change the coherences between states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , they will only diminish it .",
    "so if there are no coherences between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( which is the case for an initial state that is diagonal ) then @xmath69 changes only their populations while @xmath70 has no effect . as we will be assuming that our initial state is @xmath60 , we have only one number which characterises the coherences in the system , namely @xmath66 ( and we know that @xmath30 is hermitian so @xmath71 ) .",
    "3 .   we should also mention that the triplet product in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is often referred to as a signalling state , related to how molecules can `` communicate '' with each other via a process known as signalling in biology @xcite .",
    "although we will not be interested in signalling process itself , we should note that it is essential for cryptochrome to be in this state in order to participate in magnetoreception , i.e.  cryptochrome is considered to be `` active '' when it is in this state and its signalling activity during magnetoreception can be measured by the yield of this state @xcite .",
    "for this reason we consider the reaction modelled by fig .",
    "[ chemreactgraph ] to be complete when @xmath4 ( corresponding to the triplet product state ) is reached .",
    "the time for the radical - pair reaction to happen will thus be measured by the time it takes the quantum walk to go from @xmath2 to @xmath4 .",
    "the hitting time of a random walk ( classical or quantum ) is the time taken to reach a preassigned state for the first time from a given initial state in one specific realization of the walk .",
    "the average hitting time is then the average of hitting times obtained over many realizations of the random walk .",
    "here we define the average hitting time and calculate an expression for it in terms of the evolution map .",
    "a reason for considering the average hitting time is that it is a function of the coherences in the quantum walk .",
    "thus in general the average hitting time for a quantum walk will be different to a classical random walk where there are no coherences .    in discrete time the average hitting time",
    "can be characterised by the average number of steps taken to reach @xmath61 starting from @xmath60 .",
    "if we denote the number of steps taken to reach @xmath61 by @xmath59 , and its probability distribution by @xmath72 , the average value of @xmath59 is then defined by @xmath73 the average hitting time will simply be @xmath74 we will loosely refer to @xmath72 as the hitting - time distribution even though it is actually the probability for the number of steps to reach @xmath61 . to calculate",
    "@xmath75 we first need to find @xmath72 , which is defined as @xmath76 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "an important difference between quantum and classical hitting - time distributions lies in the fact that a quantum system can be in a coherent superposition of states whereas a classical system can not .",
    "this means that we have to measure a quantum system to see if it is in a particular state or not .",
    "for this reason the conditional probability has to refer to a sequence of measurements which expresses the knowledge that the system is not in state @xmath61 for all times prior to @xmath77 .",
    "since we are only interested in whether the system is in @xmath61 or not at each time , the measurement outcome is binary .",
    "the change brought upon the system state by such a measurement can again be effected by kraus maps in the following manner : if the system state is @xmath78 before the measurement , its state immediately after the measurement given that it is found in @xmath61 is @xmath79 }   \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the denominator in normalises @xmath80 .",

    "we have @xmath91 because the process begins at @xmath92 . in principle",
    "we are done since @xmath75 is just the weighted sum with @xmath72 given by .",

    "the first is that is an exact formula for @xmath75 . for numerical evaluations",
    "is simpler to use compared to the weighted sum because has to be truncated at some @xmath59 .",
    "such a value of @xmath59 is determined from the normalisation of @xmath72 and is permissible provided that @xmath72 is effectively normalised .",
    "on the other hand can be used without the need to preexamine @xmath72 .",
    "when the hitting - time distribution has a long tail it is also faster to use compared to .",
    "second , @xmath75 depends on the size of @xmath28 since this is the average number of steps required for the system to reach @xmath61 for the first time .",
    "the smaller the step size the more steps the system must take to get to @xmath61 .",
    "the actual time however will not depend on @xmath28 provided that it is small enough .",
    "finally , the definition of hitting time adopted here though sensible , is not universal .",
    "as alluded to under , the ability for a quantum system to have a wavefunction spread over many sites makes the system s `` location '' a fuzzy concept . because of this the quantum hitting time is not uniquely defined and it may be advantageous to use alternative definitions when more information about the quantum walk is available @xcite . in this paper we will only use , which stems from the definition for @xmath72 . in the next section",

    "due to the lack of data for cryptochrome we will use this value in our simulations as was done in ref .",
    "therefore we set @xmath102 .",
    "note that if @xmath103 is an accurate estimate of @xmath100 for cryptochrome then @xmath1 should be smaller than this number since we have neglected the initial stages of photon absorption , protonation , and the intermediate radical pairs .",
    "thus @xmath101 is likely to be an upper bound for the true value of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ chemreactgraph ] .",
    "as this number is for photolyase rather than cryptochrome we also consider the average hitting time when @xmath1 is an order of magnitude above and below @xmath103 @xcite . the @xmath104 transition rate can be taken to be the rate at which the singlet state of  in fig .",

    "lastly , an accurate simulation of the time evolution defined by requires a time step @xmath28 that is much smaller than any of the rates above . a method to find a suitably small value of @xmath28 is to use the independence of the average hitting time @xmath129 on @xmath28 for a fixed set of system parameters . for the parameters shown in table  [ ratessummaryapp ] we find that @xmath129 stops changing when @xmath28 is @xmath130 or less .",
