    "the spin  network quantum simulator model @xcite represents a bridge between circuit schemes for standard quantum computation and approaches based on notions from topological quantum field theories ( tqft ) @xcite . the spin  network computational space , naturally modelled as a graph for any fixed number of incoming spins , supports computing processes represented by families of paths and provides , on the one hand , a consistent discretized version of the topological quantum computation approach . on the other hand , such a quantum combinatorial scheme , which essentially encodes the ( quantum deformed ) @xmath0 racah ",
    "wigner tensor algebra , turns out to be particularly suitable to address problems arising in ( low dimensional ) topology and group theory .",
    "the guiding idea of this paper is that the exponential efficiency that quantum algorithms may achieve with respect to classical ones proves to be especially relevant in problems in which the space of solutions is characterized by a structure definable in terms of the grammar and the syntax of a language , rather than algebraic or number  theoretic in nature .",
    "the spin  network setting provides a ` natural encoding ' for classes of problems which basically share the combinatorial structure of the language underlying the ( re)coupling theory of @xmath0 angular momenta @xcite .    on the other hand , the jones polynomial @xcite is no doubt the most famous knot invariant in topology , a knot invariant being a function on knots ( or links , namely circles embedded in @xmath6space ) which is invariant under isotopy ( smooth deformations ) of the knot . among its many connections to various mathematical and physical areas ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for applications in statistical mechanics ) , we are mainly interested here in its relations with tqft @xcite . in the seminal paper @xcite , witten put link invariants in a field theoretical setting , showing that jones polynomials arise as vacuum expectation values of wilson loop operators in a three dimensional @xmath0 chern  simons ( topological ) quantum field theory where the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xmath0 lives on each component of the link .",
    "such an invariant was extended to arbitrary representations living on the link components and in this paper we shall deal with such generalizations , referred to as ` extended ' or ` colored ' jones polynomials @xcite .    from the ( classical ) computational side ,",
    "it was proved that the exact evaluation of the jones polynomial of a link @xmath1 , @xmath7 at @xmath8 root of unity , can be performed in polynomial time in terms of the number of crossings of the planar diagram of @xmath1 if @xmath9 is a 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 6th root of unity .",
    "otherwise , the problem is @xmath10hard @xcite ( the computational complexity class @xmath10hard is the enumerative analog of the @xmath11 class ) .",
    "however , kitaev , larsen , freedman and wang @xcite showed that their ` topological ' quantum computation setting , relying on the same tqft quoted before , implicitly provides an efficient quantum algorithm for the approximation of the jones polynomial at a fifth root of unity . unfortunately , this important algorithm was never explicitly formulated .",
    "this is particularly unfortunate since it is known that the approximation problem is * bqp*hard , and a quantum algorithm for this problem is thus of particular importance .",
    "let us point out that recently aharonov , jones and landau proposed an efficient quantum algorithm that approximates the problem of evaluating the jones polynomial based , rather than on physical results from tqft , on the path model representation of the braid group and the uniqueness of the markov trace for the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra @xcite .",
    "the argument is that the @xmath10hardness of the problem does not rule out the possibility of good approximations , and indeed these authors provide an efficient , explicit and simple quantum algorithm to approximate the jones polynomial at all roots of unity for both the trace and the plat closures of a braid . + our strategy is quite different from theirs , since we shall basically provide a quantum ( automaton ) system whose internal evolution can be controlled in such a way that its probability amplitude gives the desired polynomial .",
    "as mentioned , one of the features of the jones polynomial that will be used extensively is that it can also be defined via braids ( a geometric @xmath12braid is a set of @xmath12 strands with fixed endpoints in the plane ) .",
    "a braid can be ` closed up ' to form a link by tying its ends together . in this paper we shall be interested in one of the two ways to perform such closures , namely the plat closure of the braid , and hence consider extended jones polynomials associated with such link diagrams , _ cfr . _",

    "the study of braid groups and their applications is a field which has attracted great interest from physicists , mathematicians and computer scientists alike ( _ cfr . _",

    ", applications to knot theory have been known for years , while applicability to the field of cryptography has been realized recently @xcite .",
    "the analysis of algorithmic problems related to braid group has thus acquired a great practical significance , in addition to its intrinsic theoretical interest .",
    "the approach we present here exploits a @xmath4braided version of the original spin  network setting @xcite to make it accept the language of the braid group and to deal with link polynomials ( see @xcite for a presentation of some preliminary results ) . as pointed out before , the ` physical ' background provided by the 3@xmath13 quantum @xmath0 chern ",
    "simons field theory plays a prominent role , because our computational scheme is actually designed as a discretized conterpart of the topological quantum computation setting proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , this framework is exactly what is needed to deal with ( normalized ) @xmath0colored link polynomials expressed as vacuuum expectation values of composite wilson loop operators , on the one hand , and with unitary representations of the braid group , on the other .",
    "these expectation values , in turn , will provide a bridge between the theory of formal languages and quantum computation , once more having as natural arena for discussion the @xmath4braided spin  network environment . we are going to implement families of finite states ( and discrete time)quantum automata capable of accepting the language generated by the braid group , and whose transition amplitudes are colored jones polynomials . more precisely , our results will be interpreted in terms of ` processing of words ' written in the alphabet given by the generators of the braid group on a quantum automaton in such a way that the expectation value associated with the internal automaton ` evolution ' is exactly the extended jones polynomial . the quantum automaton in question",
    "will in turn correspond to a path in the @xmath4braided spin ",
    "network computational graph .",
    "the calculation of the polynomial of ( the plat closure of ) a link @xmath1 on @xmath2 strands will be shown to be bounded from above by a linear function of the number of crossings of the link , on the one hand , and polynomially bounded in terms of the braid index @xmath2 , on the other .",
    "notice that the growth rate of the time complexity function in terms of the integer @xmath3 appearing in the root of unity @xmath4 can be easily estimated to be ( polynomially ) bounded by resorting to the tqft background , since @xmath3 is nothing but the chern ",

    "we shall leave as open problems the analysis of the complexity of the preparation of ( initial and final ) states as well as the efficient implementation of the individual automaton transition functions , which might be addressed by means of approximating ( classical or quantum ) algorithms .",
    "+ in conclusion , we argue that our field theoretical approach could be further generalized , by suitable modifications of the braiding prescriptions in the spin  network scheme , to deal with 2variables link polynomials such as the homfly invariant @xcite , related to the partition function of potts model @xcite .",

    "once a final state @xmath374 has been selected ( the right permutation can be singled out in a fast way even by a classical machine ) the evaluation of the polynomial is carried out by the automaton in a number of steps linear in the length @xmath375 of the ` word ' @xmath313 . since @xmath375 is the sum of the numbers of elementary braiding operators and @xmath4duality transformations entering the explicit expression of @xmath313 , the length of the word is bounded from above by a linear function of the number of crossings of the plat presentation of the associated link @xmath1 . on the other hand , in the worst case we have to perform one duality transformation before applying each elementary braiding operator @xmath376 .",
    "this happens , for instance , in the evaluation of the jones polynomial of the trefoil knot illustrated in the appendix .",
    "this latter remark lead us to conclude that the time complexity function ( more precisely , the number of computational steps in our automaton calculation ) equals the length of @xmath313 and is bounded according to @xmath377 is a positive number depending on the number of generators of the braid group @xmath364 and @xmath378 is the number of crossings in the plat presentation of the link @xmath1 . + we can estimate @xmath379 by observing that any such automaton can be uniquely associated with a particular path @xmath380 in the @xmath4braided spin ",

    "in particular , the maximum number of elementary @xmath4racah transforms entering a duality matrix of type must coincide with the number of racah transforms entering into one ( classical ) @xmath149 symbol since the combinatorics of such operations is manifestly the same .",
    "hence we may exploit results from graph theory which tell us that the rotation graph @xmath383 obtained from @xmath384 by ignoring twists ( or braidings) has a diameter of the order @xmath385 ( the diameter is defined as the maximum over the set of distances between pairs of vertices , where the distance is the minimum number of edges connecting two given vertices ) ( _ cfr .",
