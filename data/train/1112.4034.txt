    "after being constructed in the 1920s@xcite the variable phase method ( vpm ) was soon adapted to the theory of potential scattering by morse and allis@xcite and has been expanded by numerous authors since as a method to solve scattering and confinement problems in quantum mechanics.@xcite the method has proven to be robust in the non - relativistic case and has been applied to various physical problems , including an analysis of the statically screened coulomb potential@xcite and the ionization of the electron - hole plasma@xcite in conventional semiconductors . the method has also been used to find scattering lengths of colliding atoms@xcite and has been extended for use with non - local potentials.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , the method has never been applied to the two - dimensional modification of the dirac - weyl equation describing the low - energy spectrum of charge carriers in graphene.@xcite in this paper we study the presence of bound modes within a smooth , confining electrostatic potential well in graphene in a waveguide geometry .",
    "it is generally accepted that purely electrostatic confinement of charge carriers in graphene is not possible due to the effect of klein tunneling.@xcite at finite energy , carriers inside a potential well couple to states outside the potential via same - energy states in the valence band .",
    "this is due to the conservation of chirality , which forbids backscattering for normally incident particles,@xcite therefore the transmission probability is unity irrespective of the barrier height .",
    "however , for particles possessing a finite longitudinal wavevector , which is the situation for particles that are not normally incident on the barrier , the effect is diminished.@xcite this suggests that a waveguide geometry , in which electrons with such a longitudinal wavevector propagate along the channel , may be appropriate for the creation of conducting channels in graphene sheets .",
    "it has been previously demonstrated that the waveguide geometry for electrostatic potential wells does indeed lead to the lateral confinement of electrons in channels,@xcite from which these confined modes provide an enhanced longitudinal conductivity .",
    "however , for energies away from the dirac point the conductivity provided by the confined states is swamped by the sea of free carriers in the sample .",
    "this complicates the immediate application of graphene to digital electronics , which requires high on / off ratio current .",
    "it is therefore prudent to consider a graphene sheet close to the charge neutrality point , which can be easily achieved by adjusting the back - gate potential .",
    "exact analytical solutions for a smoothly - varying electrostatic confinement potential are only known for a somewhat unrealistic hyperbolic secant potential at zero energy,@xcite and are also available at any energy for even less realistic square wells.@xcite the vpm allows one to probe the presence of confined states in any arbitrary potential channel as long as the potential decays faster than @xmath0 at large distances away from the central axis and is non - singular at finite distances .",
    "therefore this method can act as a tool to determine the confined states in physically realizable electrostatic potentials .",
    "there is also continued interest in chiral tunneling and potential scattering problems in graphene.@xcite the vpm provides an efficient numerical tool for treating above - barrier reflection from arbitrary - shaped decaying one - dimensional potentials at non - normal incidence .",
    "the rest of this work is outlined as follows . after developing the formalism of the vpm in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we show that the method suggests a model top - gate structure should support zero - energy modes ( sec .",
    "[ results ] ) and captures a hitherto unknown major distinction between exponentially - decaying and more realistic power - law decaying potentials .",
    "namely , there is a threshold potential strength for the appearance of a confined zero - energy state in an exponentially - decaying potential , whereas there is no threshold for a power - law decaying potential .",
    "this observation is confirmed by general analysis in sec .",
    "[ threshold ] .",
    "we discuss the impact of our results in sec .",
    "appendices  [ appenda ]  and  [ appendb ] contain detailed derivations of the analytic results for two exponentially - decaying potentials , which were used to validate the proposed variable - phase method .",
    "in the low - energy approximation , charge carriers around a dirac point in graphene are governed by the dirac - weyl hamiltonian acting on a two - component wavefunction.@xcite in the presence of an external electrostatic potential @xmath1 the hamiltonian is given by@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermi velocity of the charge carriers , @xmath4 are the pauli spin matrices and @xmath5 are the linear momentum operator components . for completeness , and due to interest in the creation of confined states via band gaps in graphene , a mass term @xmath6 is included in the final term in eq .  .",
    "here @xmath7 denotes whether the low - energy approximation is around the @xmath8 or @xmath9 points . since the potential varies only in @xmath10 , the momentum operator @xmath11 commutes with the hamiltonian and so we may seek a solution in the form of the two - component wavefunction @xmath12^t$ ] , where @xmath13 is the longitudinal wave vector along the waveguide and @xmath14 refer to the wave - function components associated with the inequivalent @xmath15 sublattices in graphene .",
    "these wave - function components satisfy the coupled first - order differential equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the energy eigenvalue , @xmath19 which we assume to be rapidly vanishing as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "notably , the sign of the potential is not important in considerations of zero - energy states in gapless graphene , as can be seen by reducing the system of eqs .   to a second - order differential equation ( see appendix  [ appenda ] ) .",
    "incidentally , there has been a recent rise in interest in zero - energy states in graphene , due to both a curiosity in edge states@xcite and the possibility of observing majorana zero - modes in this system.@xcite    following the work of babikov,@xcite we write a wavefunction component as a superposition of transmitted and reflected waves @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are known as the transmission functions and reflection functions respectively , and propagation is taken to be in the positive @xmath10 direction .",
    "in addition to the introduction of the transmission and reflection functions , we will impose a condition on the first derivative of the upper wavefunction component , as we are free to do to completely define @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    our choice of wavefunction in eq .",
    "is a modification of the free - particle solution which has the energy spectrum @xmath25 , which includes a band gap of @xmath26.@xcite the amplitude functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 have a natural interpretation if one considers the potential to possess cutoffs at a point @xmath27 to the left of the origin and @xmath28 to the right of the origin .",
    "then the barrier exists only in the region @xmath29 $ ] ; outside of this region the amplitude functions are not expected to be position dependent , thus @xmath30 is simply the transmission amplitude and @xmath31 is the reflection amplitude.@xcite for a fast - decaying potential the amplitude functions tend to these position - independent values away from the center .",
    "since the considered problem contains only a single electron and the electrostatic potential well , one may assert boundary conditions on the amplitude functions .",
    "the ingoing amplitude is unity , @xmath32 , and the reflection on the other side of the boundary is zero , @xmath33 .",
    "the reflection coefficient@xcite can then be simply taken to be @xmath34 .    in implementing the vpm",
    "we make the following aforementioned ansatz on the first derivative of the upper wavefunction component @xmath35 the ansatz indeed agrees with direct differentiation of the wavefunction in the limit of large @xmath10 , when the amplitudes become constants .",
    "however , this choice of ansatz is expedient because it always allows the transmission function to be eliminated later on ( resulting in a differential equation purely in terms of the reflection function ) . equating the right - hand side of eq .   with the full derivative of the wavefunction yields the following useful relation for the transmission function @xmath36 upon substituting eqs .",
    "( [ wftransref ] ) and ( [ wfansatz ] ) into the second of eqs .",
    "we find the lower component of the wavefunction to be @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is exactly the form for @xmath38 that one would expect from a flat potential profile , since it reflects the pseudospinor nature of the components .",

    "this is a nonlinear , first - order differential equation of the riccati type and does not permit an analytical solution for an arbitrary potential .",
    "numerical attempts to solve this equation will break down if @xmath41 , which would occur for a potential in which the fermi energy crosses both electron - like and hole - like regions . for real wavevectors ,",
    ".   describes scattering problems for dirac fermions ; reflection and transmission amplitudes can easily be found and the signature of resonant tunneling through the barrier is indicated by zeros in the reflection amplitude at certain values of energy and the parameters of the potential . for imaginary wavevectors , eq .",
    "allows one to tackle confinement problems for dirac fermions , including analysis of bound and quasi - bound states , which are of special interest due to the phenomenon of klein tunneling.@xcite    we are interested in probing the presence of bound modes in the potential at zero energy for the massless dirac fermions of pristine graphene , thus we must set @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the massless case",
    "the charge carriers exhibit valley symmetry , allowing us to confine ourselves to only one @xmath8 point by setting @xmath44 without loss of generality . in making the choice of complex wavevectors ,",
    "the interpretation of the reflection probability from the potential barrier is that bound - state resonances are indicated by divergences ( peaks ) in @xmath45.@xcite as a result , solving the differential equation numerically becomes almost intractable .",
    "these divergences are overcome by applying a convenient regularization of the form @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and rewriting the differential equation in terms of the phase function @xmath47 .",
    "divergences in @xmath24 are mapped onto @xmath48 , thus the numerical method becomes manageable .",
    "this is familiar from the levinson theorem applied to the one - dimensional dirac problem,@xcite in that the appearance of a new bound state corresponds to an accumulated scattering phase shift of @xmath49 .",

    ".   is a stiff differential equation so it requires implicit multi - step methods in order to accurately proceed to @xmath54 .",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath34 can then be found.@xcite",
    "we can now implement the vpm for massless dirac fermions into physical problems .",
    "it is instructive to first demonstrate that this numerical method can reproduce analytical results from the literature .",
    "an exact result has been stated for an electron waveguide defined by the model potential @xmath55 in ref .  [ ] . however , since the derivation of this result@xcite has been left out of the widely available literature , we outline a procedure to obtain the exact solution in appendix  [ appenda ] . in this case",
    ", the condition for zero - energy confined states to be supported is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a non - negative integer and the threshold for the appearance of the first mode is @xmath58 .",
    "for example , if we choose a potential with unit characteristic width ( @xmath59 ) and consider modes with propagating wavevector @xmath60 we expect zero - energy modes to appear at integer values of potential strength @xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplething ] , we plot the reflection coefficient @xmath45 against potential strength for three values of @xmath62 , including @xmath60 .",

    "let us then consider a more physically realizable electrostatic potential , namely the potential created by a top - gate structure as in fig .",
    "[ fig : topgate](a ) .",
    "this structure can be formed by the deposition of a thin metallic strip onto an insulating layer of material on the graphene sheet .",
    "the insulating layer may be removed , for example , by solvents , producing a so - called ` air bridge'.@xcite a model top - gate potential can be obtained , to first order , from the well - known method of image charges@xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the distances between the metallic back gate and the graphene sheet and charged top gate , respectively , and @xmath68 is matched to the top - gate voltage by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the characteristic width of the top gate . for simplicity , we assume the dielectric constant of the dielectric layer between the graphene and metallic back gate to be equal to unity , which corresponds to the experimentally attainable case of suspended graphene.@xcite the presence of a dielectric can be easily accounted for , again with the method of images;@xcite however , it does not noticeably change the functional dependence of the potential , and especially its long - range asymptotics . to compare the top gate and hyperbolic secant waveguides we use a simple fitting procedure : fixing the potential maximum at the origin and the half width at half - maximum.@xcite this yields the following expressions for @xmath71 , the absolute value of the potential at @xmath72 , and @xmath73 in terms of top - gate parameters , for which the hyperbolic waveguide potential will best match that produced by the realistic top gate , @xmath74 for unit characteristic width ( @xmath59 ) of the hyperbolic waveguide we show an example of this fitting procedure in fig .  [",

    "we can see that close to the origin the potentials fit well , since both functions are approximately parabolic . at large distances",
    "the behavior is very different , however ; the secant hyperbolic waveguide is exponentially suppressed , whereas eq",
    ".   falls as @xmath78 .",
    "this difference motivates this work because different behavior would be expected for states which possess quasiclassical turning points at significantly different distances from the origin .",
    "there is also a fundamental mathematical difference between the two confinement potentials under consideration ; namely , the different behavior of the logarithmic derivative of the potential , which features in eq .  .",
    "in general the logarithmic derivative term will reach zero asymptotically for a power - law decay , whereas it will tend to a constant value for any exponential damping .",
    "since an exponentially damped electrostatic potential is not realistic , we should be cautious when drawing general conclusions from such a model function .",
    "we compare the results of the analytic solution@xcite and the more realistic potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterpeaks](a ) .",
    "as expected , in both cases new propagating states appear fairly regularly with increasing potential depth .",
    "the appearance of bound states for the hyperbolic secant waveguide follows a linear relation between @xmath71 and @xmath62 and new states appear equally spaced according to the analytical relationship .",
    "the top - gate also produces new states following a roughly linear relationship for large propagating wavevectors .",
    "such a similarity is to be expected when one notes that an electron possessing a large propagating wavevector will have quasiclassical turning points close to the origin , where the potentials possess similar functional forms .     and @xmath59 .",

    "in fact , contrary to the hyperbolic secant waveguide ( and indeed the exponentially decaying cusp waveguide which also yields an exact solution , see appendix  [ appendb ] ) , which possesses a finite threshold value , for the realistic top - gate waveguide case we find a complete absence of a threshold , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : scatterpeaks](b ) .",
    "this could be attributed to the logarithmic derivative term , which acts drastically different in the two cases ( as we shall see in sec .  [ threshold ] )",
    "such that only potentials with exponential tails have a threshold potential strength .",
    "this should lead to an enhanced conductivity in a graphene sheet for waveguide - type devices even for vanishingly weak potential channels .",
    "interestingly , the zero threshold for a power - law decay of the confining potential does not apply universally to charge carriers in graphene .",
    "it was shown recently in the radial geometry that electrostatic potentials without exponentially decaying tails may indeed possess a threshold for the appearance of the first zero - energy state.@xcite",
    "it has been stated in ref .  [ ] ( see also appendix  [ appenda ] ) and shown numerically in sec .  [ results ] that for the hyperbolic secant waveguide there exists a threshold potential strength , below which there are no bound states . here",
    "we show that this property does not extend to potentials that decay as a power law , such as the considered model top - gate potential eq .  , due to the logarithmic derivative of the potential tending towards zero asymptotically .",
    "first , let us consider the case of a general exponentially - decaying potential @xmath80 with parameter @xmath81 .",
    "as the logarithmic derivative will always tend to a constant asymptotically , in the limit @xmath20 , it follows from eqs .",

    "@xmath88 thus , we arrive at the condition @xmath89 to ensure a non - trivial normalizable solution in the limit of large negative @xmath10 and so it is apparent in this scenario we do indeed have a threshold , as we expect from our numerical solutions in sec",

    "a particular case of the hyperbolic secant potential is considered in appendix  [ appenda ] .",
    "the presence of a threshold in the product of potential strength and spread for the appearance of the first confined mode can also be shown explicitly for another exponentially - decaying potential supporting analytic zero - energy solutions which is considered in appendix  [ appendb ] .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the equation governing the behavior of the lower wavefunction component @xmath90 in the potential @xmath91 , where the decay is characterized by @xmath92 . in the limit @xmath20 eqs .",
    "yield @xmath93 and a similar equation for @xmath83 can be written by changing @xmath62 to @xmath84 in eq .  .",
    "both of these equations can easily be reduced to a confluent hypergeometric differential equation , known as kummer s differential equation.@xcite the square - integrable solutions describing the first emergent state for both wavefunction components when @xmath85 are@xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind , or tricomi function .",
    "the corresponding square - normalizable solutions for @xmath87 are@xcite @xmath96 the terms including the tricomi functions decay quickly at large @xmath10 ( in the region considered ) for all decay strengths @xmath97 and propagating wave vectors @xmath98 , as can be seen via a series expansion at infinity.@xcite the functional forms of the wave - function components at large distances , eqs .",
    "( [ positive1],[negative1 ] ) , indicate that no conditions are required to be imposed upon the longitudinal wave vector @xmath62 and hence there is no threshold of potential strength at which bound states first appear .",
    "the variable phase method is elegant because it allows one to solve the schrdinger equation directly for physical quantities , such as the reflection coefficient or the scattering phase , rather than needing to extract these properties from the wave function.@xcite we have shown that this method can be extended to the dirac - weyl equation .",
    "we expect this method to become broadly used for modeling top - gate devices in the considered waveguide geometry , as well as for calculating barrier transparency at non - normal incidence , by computing reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "the vpm also offers significant practical advantages : whilst it is always possible to reduce two coupled first - order differential equations into a decoupled second - order equation , the vpm allows one to decouple into a single first - order equation , from which a useful physical property can be immediately obtained .",
    "of course , the nonlinear nature of the equation is of little importance when integrating numerically .    in conclusion",
    ", we have modified the variable - phase method so that it can be used to study quasi - one - dimensional problems , such as electron channels , for the quasi - relativistic charge carriers of graphene .",
    "the method has been validated by reproducing the exact result for a hyperbolic secant waveguide .",
    "we have gone on to find , for a model top - gate electrostatic potential with experimentally obtainable parameters , that there is no potential strength threshold for bound state emergence , so the first confined mode exists for an arbitrarily weak power - decaying potential . with increasing potential strength",
    "further confined states appear in steps of applied top - gate voltage of the order of tens of millivolts .",
    "in fact , we have found that while there is always a threshold potential strength for the appearance of the first confined zero - energy state in channels defined by a potential with exponential tails , there is no such threshold in potentials decaying as a power law .",
    "this suggests that both the square waveguide model and indeed models with exponential tails are somewhat unsatisfactory , because they miss an important physical property necessarily present in more realistic top - gate defined potentials .",
    "the presence of zero - energy modes for all realistic power - law decaying waveguide potentials can be related to the well - known problem of non - vanishing conductivity in graphene for the case of smooth disorder .",
    "our results provide an additional argument in favor of the so - called resistor network model for minimum conductivity.@xcite    electrostatically - defined waveguides are free from apparent shortcomings of graphene nanoribbons such as strong back - scattering produced by edges and technological difficulties in controlling nanoribbon parameters .",
    "moreover a top - gate controlled potential prevents edge - related scattering and can serve as an analog of an electrostatically - defined carbon nanotube with an enhanced mean free path .",
    "we expect truly confined states to be observable in charge neutral pristine graphene without the need of magnetic fields , strain engineering or the introduction of band - gaps , a potential way forward in the pursuit of graphene devices aimed at digital manipulation of current .",

    "<S> using the variable phase method , we reformulate the dirac equation governing the charge carriers in graphene into a nonlinear first - order differential equation from which we can treat both confined - state problems in electron waveguides and above - barrier scattering problems for arbitrary - shaped potential barriers and wells , decaying at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this method agrees with a known analytic result for a hyperbolic secant potential and go on to investigate the nature of more experimentally realizable electron waveguides , showing that , when the fermi energy is set at the dirac point , truly confined states are supported in pristine graphene . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to exponentially - decaying potentials , we discover that the threshold potential strength at which the first confined state appears is vanishingly small for potentials decaying at large distances as a power law , but nonetheless further confined states are formed when the strength and spread of the potential reach a certain threshold . </S>"
