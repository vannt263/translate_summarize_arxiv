    "<S> are determined by solution of the boundary value problem . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the first approach ( not a boundary value problem ) , the tangential electric field vanishes on the metallic surface . </S>",
    "<S> there is no radial poynting vector at the surface . </S>",

    "<S> * i. introduction * + this paper is a didactic discussion of how the electromagnetic energy radiated by an antenna emerges from a localized source , is guided by the antenna s conductors , and ultimately shakes free to form the radiation described by the asymptotic poynting vector . </S>",
    "<S> how this happens and what is the true seat of the power radiated is understood by many , but not by all . </S>",
    "<S> i hope that an analysis of the rights and wrongs and the treatment of specific examples prove useful .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of how electromagnetic energy is transported along a system of conductors dates back to j. h. poynting s 1884 paper , _ on the transfer of energy in the electromagnetic field _ </S>",
    "<S> , in which he enunciates his theorem and discusses various examples .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite poynting does not consider radiating systems , but he was very clear on the transport of the electromagnetic energy associated with current - carrying wires and quasi - static circuits such as a discharging capacitor .    in modern notation poynting </S>",
    "<S> s theorem takes the form , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the _ poynting vector _ , @xmath2 and @xmath7 are the fields , @xmath1 is the current density , and , with some qualifying caveats that need not concern us here , @xmath8 is the electromagnetic energy density within a chosen volume _ v _ bounded by the surface _ s_. </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of the theorem is that the left - hand integral represents the rate at which the given sources ( @xmath9 ) supply energy to the electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the volume integral on the right is the rate of increase of electromagnetic energy within _ v _ , while the surface integral is the rate at which energy escapes from _ v _ through the surface _ </S>",
    "<S> s_. the theorem is basically a statement of conservation of energy .    in the late 19th and early 20th centuries </S>",
    "<S> , radiated systems were investigated chiefly by specification of simple oscillating current and charge distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic fields were found and the poynting vector evaluated to give the radiation pattern . performing the surface integral on the right in ( [ theorem ] ) gave the total radiated power _ </S>",

    "<S> the volume integral on the right in ( [ theorem ] ) vanishes for a time average ; the input power is equal to the power radiated . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation resistance can be computed equally well by evaluating the integral over the sources on the left - hand side of ( [ theorem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach was taken up by many  @xcite because of its appeal : the current of each element along the arms of an antenna was apparently the real source of the radiated energy .    at that time </S>",
    "<S> ( and to some extent today ) many believed that energy was transported within the conductors carrying current . </S>",
    "<S> poynting s statements to the contrary had been forgotten . </S>",
    "<S> the focus on specification of distributed current sources is widespread in many applications . </S>",
    "<S> for antennas the approach works , more or less . often antennas have thin straight conducting elements . </S>",
    "<S> if such elements have infinitesimal cross sections , it can be shown that an oscillating current is distributed sinusoidally along its length . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of sinusoidal behavior proved to yield reasonably accurate results for angular distributions of radiation from antenna arrays . specifying </S>",
    "<S> a plausible current source @xmath1 became standard practice . </S>",
    "<S> in such discussions no attention is paid to the fact that a radiating antenna is an electromagnetic boundary value problem in which the current distributed on the arms of the antenna emerges as part of the solution , not as input . </S>",
    "<S> rather , an ethereal current distribution is postulated and the resulting fields calculated . </S>",
    "<S> this approach may be appropriate for electrons orbiting in a synchrotron or undergoing a quantum - mechanical transition in an atom , but not for a careful treatment of a realistic antenna with conducting surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> the antenna as a boundary value problem has , of course , an honorable history beginning in 1897 with pocklington  @xcite who discussed the lowest mode of a perfectly conducting ring of wire ( damped by radiation loss ) . </S>",

    "<S> schelkunoff , in a paper  @xcite and a book  @xcite , discussed perfectly conducting biconical antennas in which the cones act as wave guides . </S>",
    "<S> a spherical antenna with a planar circular gap can be viewed as a limiting case .  </S>",

    "<S> i describe a particular antenna boundary value problem , a perfectly conducting sphere with a small gap at the equator , across which is an azimuthally uniform electric field . </S>",
    "<S> as already stated , this problem has been addressed by stratton and chu  @xcite and by schelkunoff  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors were interested in the impedance of the antenna , including radiation , but did not discuss the poynting vector in the neighborhood of the antenna or its evolution to the far fields . </S>",
    "<S> section iii sets up the formalism ; section iv gives examples of the energy flow , the current on the surface , and the modification of the energy flow for non - vanishing surface resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> section v contains concluding remarks . </S>",

    "<S> the potentials and the fields are then evaluated in the usual way as integrals over the source with the appropriate green function . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss briefly the very thin center - fed linear antenna in order to illustrate the confusion that can occur in evaluating the radiated power in different ways via poynting s theorem and in arguing the source of the power .    </S>",

    "<S> are the two expressions actually equal ? </S>",

    "<S> each can be transformed into the same uninformative sum of constants , logarithms , and sine and cosine integrals  @xcite that undulates as a function of _ ka_.  @xcite + 2 . </S>",
    "<S> does the variable _ z _ in @xmath34 correspond in any way to @xmath44 in @xmath40 and so connect the increment of power at position _ </S>",
    "<S> z _ on the antenna to the increment of radiated power at angle @xmath45 ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is no for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the integrand in @xmath34 is a spatial scalar , without direction , whereas the integrand in @xmath40 , although a scalar , is the dot product of the poynting vector with a unit radial vector whose direction changes with angle .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , a comparison of integrands shows smaller and larger differences between the two `` angular '' distributions depending on the value of _ ka_. as a matter of fact , for @xmath46 , the integrand of ( [ p-1 ] ) as a function of @xmath47 is equal to that of ( [ p-2 ] ) for @xmath48 , but for other values of _ ka _ the integrands can be vastly different , as shown for example in figure  [ linear ] for @xmath49 .     and @xmath40 for the total radiated power from a linear antenna with @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve is the angular distribution of radiation in @xmath51 from the poynting vector expression @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curve is the integrand @xmath52 of @xmath34 versus _ z / a_. , width=384 ]     + 3 . </S>",
    "<S> can the expression for @xmath34 justify the claim that the power radiated by an antenna has its origins at various points along the length of the antenna ? </S>",
    "<S> the short answer is no .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the fields at any point in space receive coherent contributions from all elements of the current along the whole antenna . </S>",
    "<S> king  @xcite discusses a center - fed antenna with @xmath53 , imagining it as the limit of a line of closely spaced individual generators that produce the sinusoidal current distribution . </S>",
    "<S> he shows that _ in a certain sense _ one can identify each of the three separate `` ears '' of the angular distribution at infinity with a corresponding half - wavelength segment of the current distribution . </S>",
    "<S> but he is at great pains to make clear it _ does not mean _ that the fields in each separate angular region are `` maintained entirely and exclusively by the current in [ the corresponding ] third of the antenna .  the field at any point in space is maintained by _ all _ currents in the entire antenna . '' ( _ op . </S>",
    "<S> cit . </S>",
    "<S> _ , p.565 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , as stressed in the introduction , a source distribution @xmath54 in the maxwell equations does not define appropriately an antenna boundary - value problem . </S>",
    "<S> antennas are almost universally constructed of conductors , usually very good conductors . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent approximation for the boundary - value problem is to assume perfect conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> then there can be a surface current density , but _ no tangential electric field at the surface_. there is therefore no @xmath55 to integrate over the surface to find the power . </S>",
    "<S> you might say , well , in the real world conductivities are not infinite . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we assume excellent , but not perfect , conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> in that situation things go the opposite way : there _ is _ now a tangential electric field at the surface , but _ the poynting vector points inward ! _ energy flows inward into , not out from , the conductor ; the resistance of the metal converts the electromagnetic energy into heat ; the antenna robs power from the source  @xcite . + </S>",
    "<S> as already said in the introduction , most antenna experts seem to accept the idea that the antenna structure does not itself radiate ( in the sense that segments of the conductor are the local sources of power ) , but rather guides the energy from the input source and launches it into its final radiation pattern . </S>",
    "<S> why then is the approach of specification from the beginning of the current on an antenna so widely accepted and employed ? </S>",
    "<S> one reason is that the most common antenna is linear , or an array of linear elements . for a thin linear antenna the zeroth order current </S>",
    "<S> is sinusoidal in amplitude and constant in phase with position . </S>",
    "<S> the solution  @xcite of the boundary value problem yields corrections to the current as a series in powers of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 the length of the antenna and _ r _ its radius . </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath59 is a plausible range : a _ 100 mhz _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 antenna with @xmath61 and a diameter of _ 0.5 ( 1.0 ) cm _ has @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> calculations including first order corrections show that for short antennas ( @xmath63 ) the real part of the current either dominates the imaginary part over almost the whole length of the antenna , or the relative phase changes little over the length . in either circumstance </S>",
    "<S> the radiation pattern of an antenna or antenna array will differ little from that computed with the nave zeroth order current . even for larger _ kh _ , for which the zeroth order current changes sign along the length , the imaginary part of the current is generally small compared to the real part ( except in the narrow regions where the real part vanishes ) . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the current components on center - fed linear antennas of different _ kh _ are given by halln  @xcite and king .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    if reliable values of input impedance are desired , second order corrections to the current at the input point may be required .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but for _ radiation patterns _ of linear antennas the nave assumption of a real sinusoidal current is adequate in most circumstances .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a solvable model of an antenna to show in detail how the energy flows in its neighborhood and beyond . + * iii . </S>",
    "<S> center - fed spherical antenna * + to illustrate the near fields and power flow in the immediate neighborhood of an antenna , we consider a spherical antenna of radius _ a _ with excitation provided by an electric field across a narrow equatorial gap between the perfectly conducting near - hemispheres . as noted earlier , this problem has been treated in some respects by stratton and chu  @xcite and schelkunoff .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we follow the notation of section 9.7 ff in my text .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the power source does not concern us except that it manifests itself as an electric field across the gap ( and the accompanying surface current on the surface of the sphere ) . </S>",
    "<S> the source can be imagined in schelkunoff s language of conical antennas . </S>",
    "<S> our antenna can be thought of as a limiting case of a biconical antenna with spherical segments as caps and an opening angle of almost _ 90 _ degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the sides of the cones meet at the origin inside the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> it is there that an infinitesimal generator resides . </S>",
    "<S> it causes an electric field between the upper and lower cones to emerge in an azimuthally symmetric way as @xmath64 across the gap . + </S>",
