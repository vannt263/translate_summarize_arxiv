    "spin properties of surface and edge states are hallmark of topological insulators ( tis )  @xcite which attract much interest as a playground for fundamental physics and a basis for potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing .",
    "the surface states in three - dimensional tis and edge states in two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis have a helically polarized spin structure .",
    "the spin of electrons is strongly coupled to their momentum .",
    "a consequence of this coupling is that the edge states carry a spin current .",
    "this fact stimulates the idea of creating spin currents in a nonmagnetic conductor , which is in contact with a ti .",
    "indeed , if the tunneling electrons conserve their spin and direction of the velocity , the spin filtering of electrons occurs in the nonmagnetic conductor since the electrons with different spins move with different velocities .    the existence of the helical edge states with dirac dispersion in 2d tis was proved by recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "rapid progress in nanotechnology allows one to expect the creation of mesoscopic heterostructures containing tis  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to consider a model system in which a 2d ti is coupled to a strip of normal 2d electron gas via a tunnel contact .",
    "tunneling of electrons from the edge states in 2d ti into the normal conductor results in the transition of electrons with different spins in the states with different momenta . in that way",
    "a spin current arises in the normal conductor even if the barrier is nonmagnetic and external magnetic field is absent .",
    "the present paper aims to study the spin polarization of the tunnel current in the normal conductor , to clarify what factors affect the polarization and estimate the polarization for realistic conditions .",
    "the edge states are one - dimensional ( 1d ) and therefore electron - electron interaction plays an essential role in their tunneling .",
    "the 1d electrons in these states can be considered as a helical luttinger liquid  @xcite .",
    "the interaction is known to change the one - particle density of states and to renormalize the electron velocity  @xcite .",
    "both these factors affect the tunnel current .",
    "the tunneling between parallel 1d systems is a subject of high activity in last decade .",
    "semiconductor heterostructures with tunnel - coupled quantum wires were created , and impressive magneto - tunneling experiments were carried out  @xcite , which have revealed many - particle effects .",
    "the theoretical works , which are closest to the present paper , have studied the electron - electron interaction effects on the tunnel current  @xcite , the dependence of the current on the contact length  @xcite , and such many - particle effects as fractional quasiparticles and spin - charge separation  @xcite .",
    "spin transport has been investigated much less .",
    "spin filtering of the tunnel current was explored in the case where the spin - orbit interaction acts in one of parallel quantum wires  @xcite .",
    "recently the theory of tunneling between 1d systems was extended to the helical luttinger liquids  @xcite .",
    "spin injection from helical edge states into a normal electron gas was not studied .",
    "we solve this problem by considering a model system consisting of a 2d ti coupled to a strip of normal 2d electron gas via a tunnel contact of finite length .",
    "electrons in the edge states are treated as helical luttinger liquid and the strip is considered as a multimode electron waveguide .",
    "we have found that the electron current flowing through the tunnel contact into the normal conductor is split there into two currents of electrons with opposite spins flowing in opposite directions .",
    "thus , the electron current in each branch of the waveguide outside the contact equals half of the total current through the tunnel contact .",
    "it is interesting that the electron current in the normal conductor is highly spin polarized and there is a spin current .",
    "the spin polarization @xmath0 can be very close to unity .",
    "the polarization essentially depends on the interelectron interaction in the luttinger liquid and the electron scattering by the contact .",
    "the main effect of electron - electron interaction is caused by the renormalization of the electron velocity in the edge states of the ti .",
    "increasing the interaction results in the growth of the polarization .",
    "the scattering by the contact leads to a decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "a specific effect arises when the applied voltage is varied so that a subband bottom in the waveguide crosses the dirac point of the edge state spectrum . under this condition",
    "the sign of the spin current is changed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "to study the spin - polarized current , which can be created due to the tunneling of electrons from a 2d ti , we consider the model system shown in fig .",
    "[ ti - n_contact ] .",
    "the ti occupies half - plane @xmath1 . at the line @xmath2 , it is coupled to a 2d strip of normal electron gas via the tunnel barrier of length @xmath3 .",
    "a voltage @xmath4 is applied between the ti and the strip so that the chemical potential of the edge states @xmath5 is higher than the chemical potential in the strip @xmath6 .",
    "electrons in edge states have gapless dirac - like spectrum , with the spin being strongly coupled to the momentum @xmath7 : the spin of the right - moving electrons is directed upwards and the electrons moving to the left have a spin down . in the strip of width @xmath8 , the electron spectrum is quantized in transverse direction . within each subband",
    "the spectrum is parabolic in the momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the choice of a normal electron gas , i.e. an electron gas without spin - orbit interaction , as a medium into which electrons tunnel from the ti , is caused by the fact that here the spin current is uniquely defined and can be measured experimentally ( see a discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and references there ) .    .",
    "occupied states are shown by heavy lines .",
    "( c ) energy spectra in the case where the first subband is below the dirac point and @xmath10.,width=377 ]    spin current depends on the energy of tunneling electrons .",
    "qualitatively the tunneling process looks as follows . at the beginning",
    "let us neglect the scattering by the contact .",
    "if the energy is larger than the dirac point of the edge state spectrum , right - moving electrons with spin up pass from the ti into right - moving states in the strip .",
    "in contrast , the left - moving electrons with spin down come to the left - moving states .",
    "thus the tunnel current is split in the strip into two opposite electron flows with opposite spins , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ ti - n_contact]a , b . in that way",
    "the spin current arises .    if the energy is below the dirac point , the picture is changed as shown in fig .",
    "[ ti - n_contact]c .",
    "the right - moving electrons in the ti tunnel into the left - moving states in the strip and vise - versa , the left - moving electrons in the ti come to the right - moving states .",
    "correspondingly , in this case the spin current has opposite direction .",
    "thus , the shift of the chemical potentials of the ti and the normal electron gas , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , through the dirac point results in the change of the sign of the spin current .    in a realistic situation , there are other factors , which strongly affect the polarization in addition to the conservation of the spin and velocity direction discussed above .",
    "these are the scattering of electrons by the contact , due to which some electrons can change the direction of their velocity  @xcite , and the electron - electron interaction , since it substantially changes the spectral function of electrons in 1d edge states and renormalizes the electron velocity  @xcite .",

    "[ j - v]b ) that is standard for tunneling in the luttinger liquid  @xcite .",
    "a similar oscillatory behavior occurs also in the dependence of the current on the chemical potential .",

    "correspondingly , the polarization changes from unity to a negative value , which goes asymptotically to -1 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath0 is explained as follows . when the voltage is small , the energy layer @xmath80 , within which current - carrying electrons tunnel from the ti into the strip , lies above the dirac point . in this case , practically all electrons with spin down come into left - moving states and spin - up electrons come to right - moving states in the strip ( see fig .  [ ti - n_contact]b ) and therefore @xmath81 . with increasing voltage , the above layer of tunneling electrons expands downward .",

    ".  [ ti - n_contact]c ) and similarly some spin - down electrons come to the right - moving states . as a result , the polarization decreases and changes the sign .",

    "the interaction effect is described by the parameter @xmath19 , which decreases from 1 to 0 on increasing the interaction potential from zero to infinity . within the luttinger liquid model ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath19 has two consequences that could be important for the current polarization .",
    "first , the velocity of the chiral fermions increases and second , the 1d fermions are distributed over wider region of momentum space .    the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath19 is presented in fig .",
    "[ p - g - v ] .",
    "the polarization is seen to increase with decreasing @xmath19 .",
    "this fact is explained by the first of above factors , namely , by an increase in the velocity .",
    "actually , increasing the velocity leads to a shift of the dirac point down and therefore a fewer electrons fall into the energy interval below the dirac point .",
    "[ p - g - v ] shows also that at high enough voltage the polarization sign changes with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "now consider the dependence of the polarization on the length of the contact , which reflects the effect of the electron backscattering by the contact of small length .",
    "[ j - l - g ] shows the dependence of the charge and spin currents in the strip on the contact length .",
    "as the contact length is small ( @xmath87 ) the charge current grows with @xmath3 as @xmath88  @xcite and the spin current is negligibly small because of strong scattering by the contact . when @xmath89 the spin current increases , because the scattering becomes weaker , and asymptotically reaches the electron current at @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "in this limit , the currents @xmath52 and @xmath92 increase linearly with @xmath3 until the perturbation theory in the tunnel hamiltonian is not disturbed  @xcite .",

    "we have studied the electron tunneling from helical edge states of a 2d ti to a normal 2d electron gas and concluded that this process can be an effective mechanism of creating the spin current in normal conductors .",
    "the mechanism consists in the fact that the electron tunneling into the normal conductor gives rise to two oppositely directed currents of electrons with opposite spins .",
    "one current is directed to the right from the contact , and the other does to the left , so that an single continuous spin current flows parallel to the common boundary of the ti and the normal electron gas .",
    "we have studied in detail this mechanism in detail for the system where a 2d strip of normal electron gas is coupled to the 2d ti via a tunnel contact of finite length .",
    "the electron current along the strip is equal half of the tunnel current through the contact and is highly polarized .",
    "the spin polarization essentially depends on the contact length , the electron - electron interaction parameter of the edge states and the voltage drop across the contact .",
    "the most significant features of the spin - polarization behavior are as follows :    1 .",
    "the polarization increases with increasing contact length on the scales @xmath95 or @xmath96 ; 2 .",
    "the direction of the spin current changes with changing voltage or the chemical potential when the bottom of the subbands in the strip crosses the dirac point of the edge state spectrum ; 3 .",
    "the polarization grows with increasing electron - electron interaction strength due to the renormalization of the electron velocity caused by the interaction .",
    "the effect we have described here could be observed experimentally , for example , by measuring the spin accumulation near contacts to the strip .",
    "so , if the strip is connected with electron reservoirs containing localized spin states , which are a spin bath , the spin density is accumulated there , in the same way as has been shown recently in ref .",
