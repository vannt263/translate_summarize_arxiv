    "it is common knowledge that the scattering amplitude @xmath3 of two gravitating bodies contains terms logarithmic in the momentum transfer @xmath4 in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "the terms arise from diagrams with two massless particles in the unitary cut in the t - channel . in the nonrelativistic limit",
    "these terms generate quantum power corrections to the classical hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "thus quantum corrections to the newton potential take the form  [ 1 - 20 ]    @xmath6    the first term in the expression ( [ newton ] ) corresponds to the contribution of gravitons , the second term corresponds to the contribution of photons and the last one is the contribution of neutrinos , where @xmath7 is the number of massless two - component neutrinos ( we put @xmath8 , @xmath9 below ) .    in the case of interaction of scalar particles , all contributions logarithmic in @xmath10 can be separated into two parts .",
    "the first one is the contributions in which the coefficient before @xmath4 is a function of @xmath11 with cuts in the complex plane .",
    "these contributions can be generated by `` box''@xmath12 diagrams only ( see figs .",
    "[ ff - interaction ]  c ,  d ) that have unitary cut in the @xmath13- or @xmath14-channel . these contributions , called in @xcite irreducible ,",
    "can be calculated by the double dispersion relation in variables @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "the distinctive characteristic of the contributions is that they are infrared divergent ( see expression ( [ s3 ] ) ) and , correspondingly , contain logarithms where @xmath10 plays a role of an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "the second part is the contributions that are entire rational functions of @xmath13 .",
    "they arise from the diagrams that have no unitary cut in the @xmath13- or @xmath14-channel and also from the reducible part of the `` box''@xmath12 diagrams .",
    "these contributions contain logarithms with the transfer momentum as an infrared cutoff , for example , logarithms that contain ultraviolet cutoff @xmath17 or the masses of the interacting particles @xmath18 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the second part of the amplitude can be represented as a matrix element of an effective nonlocal operator of interaction of two energy - momentum tensors ( i.e. , an effective graviton exchange ) in the @xmath19 limit ( but for arbitrary @xmath13 ) :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are the energy - momentum tensor of the matter and the ricci tensor , respectively .",
    "the main feature of the operator is that all descriptions of the interacting particles appear only in the form of _ a product _ of the energy - momentum tensors , whereas the `` propagator''@xmath12 of the effective graviton is independent of the type of interacting particles .",
    "in contrast with the operator ( [ operator ] ) , the irreducible contributions of the diagrams  [ ff - interaction ]  c ,  d contain nonmultiplicative dependance on momenta and masses of the particles and can not be represented as operators like  ( [ operator ] ) .",
    "on the basis of this operator , power quantum corrections to the schwarzschild metric were calculated in @xcite .",
    "corrections to the interactions dependent on internal angular momentum ( spin ) of a compound body were also considered .",
    "there are three ways to calculate these corrections : first of all , it is possible to calculate quantum corrections to the kerr metric for rotating compound body and to use covariant spin equation of motion in an external gravitational field @xcite as performed in @xcite ; the second way is to integrate velocity dependent interactions , also calculated in @xcite , over the volumes of the interacting bodies ; the last one is to put spin dependent energy - momentum tensor to the operator ( [ operator ] ) explicitly .",
    "the purpose of this work is to calculate power quantum corrections to the spin - dependent interactions for particles of spin @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in an elementary way @xcite that spin - averaged contributions containing @xmath10 as an infrared cutoff are exactly the same as ( [ operator ] ) .",
    "the irreducible parts of the diagrams  [ ff - interaction ]  c ,  d averaged over spins coincide with the scalar ones since the logarithm of the infrared cutoff @xmath22 is cancelled by radiation of long - wave gravitons which is spin - independent .",
    "however , it was noticed that the spin effects for rotating compound bodies with scalar constituents can differ from the ones for particles of spin @xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that , apart from the operator ( [ operator ] ) , the leading contribution to the spin effects can be generated by operators of higher order in @xmath23 .",
    "for example , first order in @xmath23 operators have the form :    @xmath24    \\notag \\\\ & = & \\sqrt{-g}\\,{\\log\\left\\vert q^2\\right\\vert}\\,\\frac{g}{16\\pi } \\left ( r^{\\nu } { } _ { \\beta ; \\alpha } -r^{\\nu } { } _ { \\alpha ; \\beta } \\right)t_{(a)}^{\\alpha } t_{(b)}^{\\beta } \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{i}\\frac{1}{4m_{i}}~\\bar{\\psi}_{i}\\left ( -i\\overleftarrow{d}_{\\nu } \\sigma ^{ab}+\\sigma ^{ab}i\\overrightarrow{d}_{\\nu } \\right ) \\psi _ { i}\\right ] ,   \\label{operator1}\\\\ \\hat{o}_{2 } & = & \\sqrt{-g}\\,{\\log\\left\\vert q^2\\right\\vert}\\,\\frac{g^{2}}{2}~\\left ( t^{\\nu } { } _ { \\beta ; \\alpha } -t^{\\nu } { } _ { \\alpha ; \\beta } \\right ) t_{(a)}^{\\alpha } t_{(b)}^{\\beta } \\left [ \\sum\\limits_{i}\\frac{1}{4m_{i}}~\\bar{\\psi}_{i}\\left ( -i\\overleftarrow{d}_{\\nu } \\sigma ^{ab}+\\sigma ^{ab}i\\overrightarrow{d}_{\\nu }",

    ", contributions to the spin - spin interactions can be generated by operators of the second order in @xmath23 :    @xmath35    the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe useful feynman rules with effective vertices introduced in @xcite and also list possible types of spin - dependent amplitudes with arbitrary coefficients ( form factors ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for all the form factors in the @xmath36 limit are presented in section 3 .",
    "results and conclusions are given in sections 4 and  5 .",
    "the single - graviton vertex for a spinor particle is ( see fig . [ vertices ]  a )    @xmath37    here @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a sort of a unit operator with the property @xmath41 for any symmetric tensor @xmath42 .",
    "the last term in braces , expression ( [ vertex1 ] ) , proportional to the minkowski metric tensor @xmath43 vanishes on - mass - shell .",
    "it is convenient to exclude such terms from the diagrams of compton scattering amplitude containing a pole in the @xmath13- or @xmath14-channel ( see fig . [ compton ] ) .",
    "this term cancels fermion propagator and generates an additional contribution to the contact interaction of a mass - shell fermion with two gravitons ( see fig .",

    "the double graviton vertex has a form :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the energy - momentum tensor of the fermion field    @xmath46    for further feynman rules the reader is referred to the papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the rest of the pole diagrams ( fig.[compton ] ) is proportional to the compton scattering amplitude in quantum electrodynamics .",

    "vector current @xmath50 can be also decomposed into a convective part and a part containing spin explicitly :    @xmath53    therefore , all vertices and lines can be decomposed into two structure including bispinor amplitudes of a fermion , namely , @xmath54 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , matrix element of the fermion - fermion scattering can be separated into three groups .",
    "the first one does not include @xmath55 explicitly :    @xmath56    the second one contains the terms which are proportional to the first power of @xmath55 :    @xmath57    and the last part contains terms quadratic in spin :    @xmath58    in the first born approximation corrections to a potential are given by a fourier transform of nonrelativistic amplitude    @xmath59    since we are interested in amplitudes in the @xmath60 limit , the form factors @xmath61 are the functions of the variable @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new variable    @xmath62    which corresponds to the @xmath63-factor of one of the interacting particles in the limit when the mass of the other goes to infinity .",
    "we start the discussion of loops with the graviton - graviton interaction shown in fig .",
    "[ gg - interaction ] .",
    "it is easy to calculate this contribution using the effective operator derived in @xcite    @xmath64    by substituting the ricci tensor from the einstein equations ( [ ein ] ) one gets the following matrix elements :    @xmath65    diagrams containing the graviton - fermion interaction ( see fig .  [ gf - interaction ] ) make the following contribution to the matrix elements :    @xmath66    these corrections coincide with the corresponding form factor corrections calculated in @xcite . by analogy with ( [ gg ] ) the contribution of the diagrams including graviton - fermion interaction ( fig .",
    "[ gf - interaction ] ) can be represented as an effective operator :    @xmath67    where the operator @xmath32 is defined by ( [ operator1 ] ) .         the rest of the diagrams ( fig .",

    "there are a number of points to be made before considering the contribution of the diagrams figs .",
    "[ ff - interaction ]  c ,  d. as stated above , the analysis of these diagrams is complicated by the presence of infrared divergencies . aside from the integrals ( [ int_b])-([int_e ] ) containing @xmath10 as an infrared cutoff ,",
    "there are contributions generated by integrals ( [ s3 ] ) , ( [ u3 ] ) containing @xmath10 as an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "there is a unitary cut in the @xmath13- or @xmath14- channel in the last - mentioned integrals , and consequently , there is a nonpolynomial dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "we present the results for the reducible and irreducible parts for each type of the matrix elements separately .",
    "however , as we shall see later , the reducible part also contains a nonpolynomial dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "the reason is a singularity in the @xmath70 limit in vector and tensor integrals of the @xmath71 type ( see expression ( [ sv3 ] ) in appendix ) where    @xmath72    in the center of mass frame the variable @xmath73 takes the form :    @xmath74    terms proportional to @xmath75 are typical for the diagrams of the sort of figs .",
    "[ ff - interaction ]  c ,  d. for example , they occur in the calculation of the polarization vector when an electron is scattered by the coulomb field in the second born approximation .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath76 cancel in the spin independent part of the matrix elements ( [ namp ] ) in the reducible and irreducible parts independently .",
    "however , in the spin dependent terms ( [ soamp ] ) , ( [ ssamp ] ) @xmath76 cancels only in the sum of the irreducible and reducible parts in the nonrelativistic limit .    taking into account",
    "all mentioned above , we write out the matrix elements for the diagrams [ ff - interaction ]  c ,  d. the reducible parts are    @xmath77    since in the expressions ( [ pp&s_red ] ) , ( [ ss_red ] ) we take the limit @xmath60 , the singularity @xmath76 turns to the singularity @xmath78 .",
    "terms not proportional to @xmath78 can be again represented in the form of an effective operator    @xmath79    the irreducible parts are    @xmath80    where functions @xmath81 are defined in appendix by eqs .",
    "( [ lws ] ) , ( [ lwa ] ) .",
    "as noted above , the terms singular in the @xmath82 limit cancel in the sum of the reducible ( [ pp&s_red ] ) , ( [ ss_red ] ) and irreducible ( [ ps_irred])-([ss_irred_2 ] ) parts    @xmath83",
    "summing up all the contributions we get the following scattering amplitudes .",
    "the terms not containing @xmath55 explicitly are    @xmath84    the terms proportional to the first power of @xmath55 are    @xmath85    at last , the part containing terms quadratic in spins is    @xmath86    using the nonrelativistic expansions of the bispinor amplitudes of the scattering particles    @xmath87    yields the amplitudes in the momentum space :    @xmath88    with the expressions ( [ fourier ] ) from appendix we obtain the corrections in the coordinate space .",
    "first of all , according to @xcite , @xcite , the power quantum correction to the newton law is the same as for scalar particles ( [ newton ] )    @xmath89    the quantum correction to the gravitational spin - orbit interaction is    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the relative momentum .",
    "the quantum correction to the lense - thirring effect is    @xmath92    the quantum correction to the interaction of the two internal angular momenta @xmath93 , i.e. , to the gravitational spin - spin interaction is    @xmath94",
    "hence , as expected , the quantum corrections to the classical hamiltonian ( [ so ] ) , ( [ lt ] ) , ( [ ss ] ) for a spinor particle differ from the full sum of the similar corrections obtained in @xcite for a rotating compound body with scalar constituents .",
    "this difference is associated with the irreducible part as well as with the reducible one that can be represented in the form of an effective operator ( see ( [ operator ] ) , ( [ gg ] ) , ( [ gf ] ) , ( [ ff-1 ] ) , ( [ ff-2 ] ) )    @xmath95    where the new operators @xmath96 take part .    following",
    "are several points concerning the operator ( [ e_2 ] ) . as demonstrated in @xcite , after averaging over the spins , the compton amplitude of fermion - graviton scattering and the scalar - graviton one coincide with the required accuracy .",
    "in particular , it means that the effects linear in spin ( see expressions ( [ so ] ) , ( [ lt ] ) ) for fermion - fermion and fermion - scalar scattering are the same .",
    "however , we see that the analysis is complicated by the singularity @xmath76 . therefore , it is not unreasonable to make sure that the separation into the reducible and the irreducible parts is the same as in eqs.([ff-1 ] ) , ( [ pp&s_red ] ) , ( [ ff-2 ] ) , ( [ pp_irred ] ) for the case of fermion scattering by a scalar particle ( evidently , there is only a contribution of one of the particles under the summation sign in the operators ( [ ff-2 ] ) , ( [ pp_irred ] ) in this case ) .",
    "we use the effective vertices derived in @xcite for scalar particles . the diagrams figs .",
    "[ ff - interaction ]  a ,  b make the following contribution to the spin effects :    @xmath97    the reducible part of the diagrams figs .",

    "the irreducible part is also equal to ( [ ps_irred ] ) .",
    "therefore the singularities @xmath78 cancel in the same way as in the case of fermion - fermion scattering .",
    "thus , the effective operator ( [ e_2 ] ) is universal for scattering of scalar particles and particles of spin @xmath0 .",
    "being interested in the quantum corrections to spin effects at the leading order in @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the speed of light ) , we considered only the matrix elements like ( [ namp])-([ssamp ] ) .",
    "formally , it is possible to consider one more matrix element at the same order in @xmath101    @xmath102    that however does not contribute to the spin effects at the leading order in @xmath99 .",
