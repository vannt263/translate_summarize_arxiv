    "the main theoretical challenges for the reliable extraction of wilson coefficients from the experimental data arise from the requirement of the quantitative understanding of qcd backgrounds at large distances . to test the sm and to improve the understanding of theoretical uncertainties one can pursue studies with @xmath16 transitions , which are related by @xmath17 to @xmath18 but not being subjected to sizable electromagnetic contributions from charm quarks .",

    "<S> the rare decay @xmath0 is expected to play an important role in searches for physics beyond the standard model at the near future @xmath1-physics experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate resonant and non - resonant backgrounds that arise beyond the narrow - width approximation for the @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> non - resonant @xmath3 decays are analyzed in the region of low hadronic recoil , where @xmath4 form factors from heavy - hadron - chiral - perturbation theory are available . in a breit - wigner - type model </S>",
    "<S> interference - induced effects in the @xmath5 signal region are found to be sizable , as large as @xmath6 in the branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding effects in the longitudinal polarization fraction @xmath7 are smaller , at most around few % . </S>",
    "<S> effects of the broad scalar states @xmath8 and @xmath9 are at the level of percent in the branching fraction in the @xmath2 signal region and negligible in @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> since the backgrounds to @xmath7 are small this observable constitutes a useful probe of form factors calculations , or alternatively , of right - handed currents in the entire @xmath10-region . the forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath11-system , @xmath12 , with normalization to the longitudinal decay rate probes predominantly s , p - wave interference free of short - distance coefficients and can therefore be used to control the resonant and non - resonant backgrounds . </S>"
