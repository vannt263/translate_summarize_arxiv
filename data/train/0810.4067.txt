    "we present results obtained by cdf  ii at the tevatron   7.5 used to select diffractive events by identifying forward rapidity gaps and reducing non - diffractive background on the trigger level , and two very forward ( 3.5 @xmath4 5.1 ) miniplug ( mp ) calorimeters  @xcite , designed to measure energy and lateral position of both electromagnetic and hadronic showers .",
    "the ability to measure the event energy flow in the very forward rapidity region is vital for the identification of diffractive events in the high luminosity environment of run  ii .",
    "] in two broad areas : inclusive diffraction and exclusive production . the main goal of the run  ii inclusive diffractive program of cdf has been to understand the qcd nature of the pomeron ) .",
    "because the exchange is colorless , a large region in pseudorapidity space is left empty of particles ( this region is called a `` rapidity gap '' ) . in perturbative qcd ,",
    "the lowest order prototype of the pomeron is the color neutral system of two gluons . ]",
    "( @xmath5 ) by measuring the diffractive structure function  @xcite @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fractional momentum loss of the diffracted nucleon , for different diffractive production processes .",
    "in addition , the possibility of a composite pomeron is being investigated by studies of very forward jets with a rapidity gap between the jets .",
    "important results are the observation of a breakdown of qcd factorization in hard diffractive processes , expressed as a suppression by a factor of @xmath8(10 ) of the production cross section relative to theoretical expectations , and the breakdown of regge factorization in soft diffraction by a factor of the same magnitude @xcite .",
    "combined , these two results support the hypothesis that the breakdown of factorization is due to a saturation of the rapidity gap formation probability by an exchange of a color - neutral construct of the underlying parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the proton  @xcite .",
    "historically , such an exchange is referred to as the pomeron .",
    "renormalizing the `` gap probability '' to unity over all ( @xmath9 , t ) phase space corrects for the unphysical effect of overlapping diffractive rapidity gaps and leads to agreement between theory and experiment ( see @xcite ) .",
    "central exclusive production in @xmath2 collisions is a process in which the @xmath10 and @xmath11 remain intact and an exclusive state x@xmath12 is centrally produced : @xmath13 .",
    "the primary motivation for studying exclusive physics at the tevatron is to test the feasibility of using exclusive production to search for and study the higgs boson as well search for other new physics at the lhc @xcite . in leading order qcd",
    ", exclusive production occurs through gluon - gluon fusion , while an additional soft gluon screens the color charge allowing the protons to remain intact  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , historically termed double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) , enables exclusive production of di - jets  @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , and the @xmath15 @xcite at the tevatron , whereas at the lhc , where central masses up to several hundred gev are attainable , new central exclusive channels open up , as for example w@xmath16w@xmath17 and z@xmath18z@xmath18 .",
    "while the main effort at the lhc is directed toward searches for inclusively produced higgs bosons , an intense interest is developing in exclusive higgs production , @xmath19 .",
    "this production channel presents several advantages , as for example the production of clean events in an environment of suppressed qcd background for the main higgs decay mode of @xmath20 due to the @xmath21 selection rule  @xcite .",
    "exclusive production can also occur through photoproduction ( @xmath5  -  @xmath22 fusion ) , yielding charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "the same tagging technique can also be utilized to select @xmath23 , or @xmath24 and @xmath25 interactions at the lhc , for which the energy reach and the effective luminosity are higher than for @xmath14 interactions .    additionally , exclusive production of central lepton pairs , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , via two - photon exchange has been observed at cdf @xcite .",
    "tagging two - photon production offers a significant extension of the lhc physics program .",
    "collisions reaches @xmath281% of the @xmath29 luminosity , so that the standard detector techniques used for measuring very forward proton scattering should allow for a reliable extraction of @xmath14 results .",
    "] particularly exciting is the possibility of detecting two - photon exclusive w@xmath16w@xmath17 , z@xmath18z@xmath18 , higgs boson and new physics production at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the deployment of forward proton detectors at 200 m and 420 m ( fp420 project ) from the interaction point of atlas and cms , in order to exploit the above mentioned forward physics scenarios , is currently under consideration @xcite .",
    "two - photon exclusive production of lepton pairs will provide an excellent monitoring tool of the tagging efficiency and energy scale of the detectors of the fp420 project .",
    "these events can also be used for several systematic studies , including luminosity normalization and contributions from inelastic production or accidental tagging .",
    "exclusive production is hampered by expected low production rates @xcite . as rate calculations are model dependent and generally involve non - perturbative suppression factors , it is sensible to calibrate them against processes involving the same suppression factors but have high enough production rates to be measurable at the tevatron .",
