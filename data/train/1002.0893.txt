    "the @xmath34 and @xmath4 are controversial particles in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "they were first found in the analysis of @xmath35 and @xmath36 scattering data .",
    "because the total phase shifts in the lower mass region are much less than 180@xmath37 and they do not fit into ordinary @xmath38 meson nonets , they have been the subject of violent debates .",
    "( @xcite - @xcite ) are some recent analyses that support their existence .",
    "evidence for @xmath4 particles comes from the study of production processes and the re - analysis of @xmath39 scattering data .",
    "evidence for the @xmath4 has been found in @xmath40  @xcite , @xmath41  @xcite , and @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath39 s - wave component is found in @xmath43  @xcite , @xmath44  @xcite , and @xmath45  @xcite . but no evidence for the @xmath4 in @xmath46  @xcite or for the charged @xmath4 in @xmath47  @xcite is seen .",
    "the @xmath4 is found in the phenomenological analysis of @xmath39 scattering phase shift data  ( @xcite ,  @xcite - @xcite ) . however , some theorists are not convinced by the evidence  ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "the present status of the @xmath4 is summarized by the particle data group pdg  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath4 particles have been studied with bes data , where evidence for @xmath34 and @xmath4 particles is quite clear  ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "a neutral @xmath4 was found in the decay @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "because of isospin symmetry , if a neutral @xmath4 exists , a charged @xmath4 should exist and could be produced in @xmath49 .    in this study , we search for and study the charged @xmath4 in @xmath50 .",
    "our analysis is based on 58 million @xmath1 decays collected by besii at the bepc ( beijing electron positron collider ) .",
    "besii is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer which is described in detail in ref .",
    "the momentum of charged particles is determined by a 40-layer cylindrical main drift chamber ( mdc ) .",
    "particle identification is accomplished using specific ionization ( @xmath51 ) measurements in the mdc and time - of - flight ( tof ) information in a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "outside of the tof is a barrel shower counter ( bsc ) which measures the energy and direction of photons .",
    "in the event selection , candidate tracks are required to have a good track fit with the point of closest approach of the track to the beam axis being within the interaction region of 2 cm in @xmath52 and @xmath53 cm in @xmath54 ( the beam direction ) , polar angles @xmath55 satisfying @xmath56 , and transverse momenta @xmath57 mev/@xmath58 .",
    "photons are required to be isolated from charged tracks , to come from the interaction region , and have deposited energy in the bsc greater than 40 mev .",
    "events are required to have four good charged tracks with total charge zero and at least two good photons .",
    "for the @xmath59 reconstruction , we loop over all oppositely charged pairs of tracks , assuming them to be pions , and fit them to @xmath60 , which determines vertices and @xmath61 invariant masses , @xmath62 , for the four possible combinations . the combination with @xmath62 closest to @xmath63 is selected and is required to satisfy @xmath64 mev/@xmath6 and have its decay vertex in the @xmath65-plane satisfy @xmath66 m. after @xmath59 selection , the particle type of the remaining two tracks , that is whether they are @xmath67 or @xmath68 , is decided by selecting the combination with smallest @xmath69 .    a four constraint ( 4c )",
    "kinematic fit is applied under the @xmath70 hypothesis , and @xmath71 is required .",
    "events with a @xmath72 invariant mass satisfying @xmath73 mev/@xmath6 are fitted with a 5c kinematic fit to @xmath74 with the two photons constrained to the @xmath75 mass , and events with @xmath76 are selected . the @xmath77 mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , where the @xmath78 is clearly seen . decays with an intermediate @xmath78 are background , and the requirement @xmath79 mev/@xmath6 is applied to remove them .",
    "the requirements @xmath80 mev/@xmath6 and @xmath81 mev/@xmath6 are used to remove backgrounds from @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "after these requirements , the combined @xmath84 and @xmath85 mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ; the highest narrow peak is charged @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87 versus @xmath88 scatter plot is shown in fig .",
    "there are two clear bands , a vertical and horizontal band , which correspond to @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the requirements @xmath91 mev/@xmath6 and @xmath92 mev/@xmath6 are imposed to select @xmath93 and @xmath94 events , respectively .",
    "after the above selection , the combined @xmath85 and @xmath95 invariant mass distribution recoiling against the @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "it is the sum of the four decays listed in table  1 with about 1000 events for each , as listed in the table , and a total of 4121 events . in fig .",
    "1(d ) , a clear narrow peak at 892 mev/@xmath6 and a wider peak at about 1430 mev/@xmath6 are seen .",
    "in addition , there is a broad low mass enhancement just above threshold .",
    "the spectrum is quite similar to the spectrum of @xmath67 in the decay @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "the biggest difference between them is that the charged @xmath86 peak is much larger than the neutral @xmath86 peak .",
    "the @xmath97 invariant mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "1(e ) , where there are indications of peaks at 1270 mev/@xmath6 and 1400 mev/@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting dalitz plot is shown in fig .",
    "the two diagonal bands correspond to the low mass enhancement combined with the 892 mev/@xmath6 peak and the peak around 1430 mev/@xmath6 in the @xmath39 spectrum .",
    ".four signal channels and number of events from each . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our final results correspond to the solution with the minimum least likelihood .",
    "differences among solutions with similar likelihood values are included as systematic uncertainties .",
    "also included are the effect of removing @xmath98 , ips , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the result of a fit with the @xmath86 background level floating , and the result from a fit using direct side - band subtraction .",
    "the masses and widths of all resonances obtained by mass and width scans are shown in table  2 . in the fit ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath101 is small ; its statistical significance is only 0.6@xmath34 . because it is expected in this channel , it is included in the final solution .",
    "the @xmath102 mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , where points with error bars are data , and the light shaded histogram is the final fit . in the figure ,",
    "the dark shaded histogram shows the contribution of the charged @xmath4 .",
    "3(b ) shows the fit for the @xmath103 spectrum , and fig .",
    "4 shows the angular distributions .",
    "the decay @xmath104 contributes 655 events .",
    "monte carlo simulation of @xmath105 determines an efficiency of 2.33% , and the branching ratio of @xmath106 or @xmath107 is br = = ( 1.09 0.18 ^+0.94_-0.54 ) 10 ^ -3 , where , the first error is statistical , the second error is systematic , the factor @xmath108 is because the events are the sum of four channels , and @xmath109 is the isospin factor . in the previous study of the decay @xmath110 , the corresponding branching ratio for the neutral @xmath4 was not reported in ref .  @xcite . in the study of the neutral @xmath4 ,",
    "the number of @xmath4 events was in the range 1891 - 3516 , and the selection efficiency was 14.2% .",
    "its branching ratio is @xmath111 @xmath112 is @xmath113 .",
    "the two results are consistent with isospin symmetry .",
    "the systematic error includes uncertainties from multi - solutions , from different background fit methods , and from removing some components from the fit ( @xmath101 , ips , @xmath99 , and @xmath114 ) .",
    "also interesting is the existence of the @xmath1 electromagnetic decay @xmath115 .",
    "the peak at 892 mev/@xmath6 in the @xmath39 invariant mass spectrum ( see fig",
    ".  1(d ) ) comes from both cross channel background and from @xmath115 .",
    "the number of events from the cross channel can be calculated approximately from the @xmath86 side - band structure , shown in fig .",
    "2(e ) , where",
    "the narrow peak at 892 mev/@xmath6 is clear . in the final fit",
    ", the decay @xmath115 contributes 323 events .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the decay @xmath116 yields an efficiency of 1.25% , and the branching ratio of @xmath7 is br = = ( 1.00 0.19 ^+0.11_-0.32 ) 10 ^ -3 , where , the first error is statistical , the second error is systematic , the factor @xmath117 is because events are counted twice , @xmath109 is the isospin factor , and 2 is because the data comes from two decay channels : @xmath118 and @xmath119 the systematic error includes uncertainties from multi - solutions , from different background fit methods , and from removing some components from fit(@xmath101 , ips , and @xmath99 ) .",
    "in conclusion , the charged @xmath4 is observed and studied in the decay @xmath105 .",
    "the low mass enhancement in the @xmath39 spectrum can not be fit well unless a charged @xmath4 is added into the solution .",
    "if we use a breit - wigner function of constant width to parameterize the @xmath4 , its pole locates at @xmath120 mev/@xmath6 . in our analysis , three different @xmath4 parameterizations are tried in the fit , and final results are shown in table  3 and are consistent with those of the neutral @xmath4 and are also in good agreement with those obtained in the analysis of @xmath39 scattering phase shifts . also , the decay @xmath121 is observed for the first time with the branching ratio @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding decay mode is not observed in @xmath110 .",
    "the decays @xmath123 can be produced through @xmath1 electromagnetic decays , while @xmath124 can only be produced through @xmath1 hadronic decays , which would be @xmath125 symmetry breaking decays and are suppressed .    *",
