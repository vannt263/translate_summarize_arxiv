    "the decays of heavy hadrons have recently received much attention in the literature @xcite . from the experimental standpoint ,",
    "these decays allow access to some of the fundamental parameters of the standard model , such as the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . questions of cp violation , heavy - flavor oscillations and many others have added to this interest .    from the theoretical standpoint , these processes , and the heavy hadrons themselves , allow various quark models of qcd , as well effective theories , to be tested . in particular , the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) has both been tested by experimental observations , and has played a major role in the extraction of @xmath6 from experimental data @xcite .",
    "much of the success of hqet has been in the treatment of decays from one heavy flavor to another , namely @xmath7 transitions .",
    "the effective theory is more limited in scope when applied to heavy - to - light transitions , such as @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "neverthless , as we will outline in a later section , the scaling behavior of the form factors that describe various weak decays can be deduced @xcite .",
    "this , in principle , allows the form factors for @xmath10 transitions to be inferred from those for @xmath8 .    in this article",
    ", we assume the validity of the heavy quark symmetry and examine the decays @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the recently measured @xmath11 in a number of scenarios .",
    "in particular , we seek a scenario in which all of these decays are adequately described by a single set of form factors .",
    "a number of authors have performed similar analyses @xcite , using the decays @xmath12 and @xmath1 , with varying results .",
    "once we find a scenario that is satisfactory for the decays mentioned above , we examine , briefly , the decays @xmath3 . in this way , we hope to make reliable estimates of the absolute decay rates for these processes . in a later article",
    ", we will consider more details of these decays , such as forward - backward asymmetries .",
    "these decays , as well as the decay @xmath2 , are particularly interesting as the short distance operators responsible arise first at the one - loop - level , and are therefore sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model @xcite . however , in order for any effects due to such new physics to be clearly identified , the long distance contributions that arise in the hadronic matrix elements must be well understood . as witness to this ,",
    "we point out that the inclusive rate @xmath13 is reasonably well understood , while the exclusive rate @xmath2 has been predicted to be anywhere from 2% to 40% of this inclusive rate @xcite .    in the case of the nonleptonic and the rare decays",
    ", there arises the crucial issue of the form factors describing the @xmath14 transition .",
    "such form factors may be estimated in various models , from qcd sum rules , or by applying the scaling relations predicted by hqet to the form factors for the corresponding @xmath15 transition .",
    "the method suggested by hqet , while clearly model - independent , is itself somewhat problematic , as one must take into account the fact that predicting @xmath16 , for instance , requires that these relations be carefully extrapolated beyond the kinematic range accessible in the @xmath15 transitions .",
    "this is because the maximum @xmath17 in the @xmath15 transitions is 1.95 ( 0.95 ) gev@xmath18 , while the @xmath17 appropriate to the @xmath19 transition is 9.6 gev@xmath18 .",
    "the hqet symmetry predictions relate form factors at the same value of the kinematic variable @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) , not @xmath17 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the four - velocities of the parent and daughter hadron , respectively . in this case , the extrapolation is from @xmath20 = 2.1 in @xmath24 to @xmath20 = 3.6 in @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the @xmath26 decays are 1.3 and 2.0 .",
    "the question of extrapolation also applies to the rare decays , and is particularly important for the decay @xmath2 , for which @xmath17 = 0 , but @xmath20 = 3.0 .    for",
    "the nonleptonic decays , a second issue is that of the factorization approximation , which is commonly used to calculate the hadronic matrix elements required .",
    "this approximation is not very well founded in general theoretically , yet it appears to work well phenomenologically in the @xmath27 decays where it has been tested .",
    "nevertheless , application of the form factors of some model or effective theory to the decay @xmath25 , in conjunction with the factorization approximation , serves to probe both issues , and may fail due either to inadequate choice of form factors , failure of the factorization approximation , or both .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe briefly the effective hamiltonians and the appropriate hadronic matrix elements for the processes of interest . in section",
    "iii we use hqet to obtain relations among the form factors of interest . in section",
    "iv we discuss our fitting procedure , and present the results for the decays that we are considering . in section v we discuss possible limitations of our results , and suggest questions that may be of interest to both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "of the three processes we discuss , the semileptonic decays are perhaps the simplest to treat theoretically .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for these decays is @xmath28 the hadronic matrix elements for the decays @xmath0 are    @xmath29    these decays are thus described in terms of six independent , _ a priori _ unknown form factors .",
    "the terms in @xmath30 and @xmath31 are unimportant when the lepton mass is ignored , since @xmath32    in experimental analyses , the form factors @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are usually assumed to have the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a mass , usually taken to be that of the nearest resonance with the appropriate quantum numbers . to date , only the mass appropriate to @xmath33 has been measured , and its value measured by cleo is @xmath40 gev @xcite .",

    "the second class contains a light meson in the final state : @xmath55 ` @xmath56 ' @xmath57 where @xmath57 is now a charmonium state .    to evaluate the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian we employ the factorization assumption .",
    "by fierz rearrangement we rewrite the effective hamiltonian in a form which is suitable for use with this assumption .",
    "both terms of the effective hamiltonian contribute , in general , but for the decays in which we are interested , only the second term is of interest , and it may be written @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of colors .    at this point , it has become customary to replace the coupling coefficient by a phenomenological constant @xmath60 , whose absolute value is measured to be approximately 0.24 .",
    "the sign of @xmath60 is not important for our discussion at this point",
    ". it will become important if long distance contributions to the dileptonic rare decays are included .",
    "for the decay @xmath61 , we therefore write , after using factorization , @xmath62 the hadronic matrix elements @xmath63 are analogs of those of the previous subsection , so that the form factors required for these matrix elements may , in principle , be obtained from the ` semileptonic ' decays of @xmath27 mesons into kaons .",

    "the effect of this mixing is very important in going from @xmath51 transitions to @xmath27 transitions , as it introduces form factors that have not yet been measured experimentally , or to which experiments are not yet sensitive , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the rates for the semileptonic",

    "there are clearly going to be corrections to the relations we have obtained . in other words ,",
    "new form factors that appear first at order @xmath132 and @xmath133 will begin to make contributions .",
    "it is expected that such contributions will become more significant away from the ` non - recoil ' point , or for @xmath134 .",
    "this is particularly important for the @xmath14 decays , as @xmath96 can become very large .",
    "nevertheless , we will apply the relations we have found through all of the available phase space .",
    "it is our hope that by doing this , we will at least be able to indicate the suitability of hqet for these transitions .",
    "however , since we fit the form factors rather than attempt to calculate them in some model , some of these higher order effects may , in fact , have been included .",
    "all of the results we describe are for decays with @xmath135 ( or @xmath136 ) in the final state .",
    "the treatment of charged kaons would be identical , and we believe that our results in these channels would be similar in quality to those we obtain for neutral kaons . before describing the results of our fits , we must comment on how we treat the available data , particularly in the case of the semileptonic decays .",
    "very few of the experimental collaborations have extracted acceptance - corrected distributions @xcite . instead , the form factors are all assumed to be of the monopole form @xcite , and the parameters are then extracted from the monte carlo simulations , with acceptances and efficiencies folded in .",
    "because of this , we proceed in the inverse sense to generate some ` simulated data ' .",
    "we use the published monopole parameters for the form factors to generate @xmath137 spectra for the semileptonic decays , using the published uncertainties in the monopole parameters to generate uncertainties in the simulated data . in general , these errors are correlated , but we ignore this correlation .",
    "the simulated data generated in this way are completely smooth .",
    "we introduce an ` anti - smoothing ' by smearing the simulated data with a pseudo - randomly generated gaussian distribution of mean zero and standard deviation determined by the errors in the unsmeared simulated data .",
    "it is this smeared simulated data that we use for fitting . for the decays",
    "@xmath138 , we also include the ratios @xmath139 and @xmath140 in the fit , where @xmath141 are as defined in pdg @xcite .",
    "in addition , we must point out that the measured decay rates for @xmath142 are somewhat smaller than those for @xmath143 , while the published form factor parametrizations are for the average over charge states . to account for this ,",
    "we rescale the values of the @xmath41 to correspond to the smaller rates for neutral kaons .",
    "it is these rescaled values that are cited in section [ sldecays ] , and that we use to generate the simulated data .",
    "for the nonleptonic decays , we fit to the pdg averaged decay widths for @xmath144 and @xmath145 . in the case of the latter",

    ", we find that @xmath155 , again indicating that the dependence on the kinematic variable is not simply a monopole form .",
    "however , for the range of @xmath17 accessible in @xmath156 decays , the decay rate is not sensitive to the kinematic dependence .",
    "the effect on the decay rate for the nonleptonic and rare decays being considered here , however , are quite significant .    in our fitting , we have separated the decays containing a @xmath56 meson in the final state from those containing a @xmath26 meson in the final state .",
    "thus , for instance , we do not include data on ratios of rates like @xmath157 .",
    "our reason is that such ratios introduce correlations between the parameters of the form factors for the two sets of decays .",
    "one approximation used recently in the literature has been to treat the strange quark as heavy @xcite , so that the decays of interest can be treated in the heavy - to - heavy limit . in this limit , the form factors of eqn .",

    "we have used this form in fitting the data , and have obtained reasonable fits to the differential decay rates in the semileptonic decays , as well as to the total decay rates in the nonleptonic decays .",
    "polarization ratios , however , are poorly reproduced . in the case of the nonleptonic decay @xmath161 , the ratio @xmath139 depends only on kinematics , and has a value of 0.43 , independent of the form chosen for @xmath117 .",
    "the experimental value is @xmath162 .",
    "in addition , the ratio @xmath140 in @xmath163 always has a value of about 0.4 , significantly different from the experimental value of 0.16@xmath1640.04 , and largely independent of the form chosen for @xmath154 .",
    "this indicates that the value of 0.43 obtained for the ratio @xmath139 in @xmath161 is not necessarily due to the breakdown of factorization in the heavy @xmath80 limit , as this limit does not even provide an adequate description of all measurements in the semileptonic decays .",
    "relaxing the strict heavy-@xmath80 limit , but constraining the form factors to be near this limit , does not help much , as the polarization observables are still not well reproduced .",
    "the conclusion that we draw from this is that the heavy-@xmath80 limit may give an acceptable description of unpolarized data , but may be dangerous when applied to polarization observables .",
    "all of the results we present are obtained by performing four kinds of fits , namely ( 1 ) include the semileptonic decays @xmath165 only ; ( 1 ) include the semileptonic decays as well as the nonleptonic decays @xmath16 ; ( 3 ) include the semileptonic decays , the nonleptonic decays @xmath16 , and the nonleptonic decays @xmath166 ; ( 4 ) include the measured decay rate for @xmath11 in the fit , as well as the three other decays .",
    "clearly , in the case of the decays to @xmath56 mesons , we need perform only three kinds of fits . in cases",
    "where a measured quantity is not included in the fit , we calculate that quantity using the fit parameters .",
    "we have explored two sets of parametrizations of the form factors . in the first scenario , which we refer to as the exponential scenario ,",

    "( [ exp1 ] ) most closely corresponds to the forms that arise in some quark models , most notably that of isgur and collaborators @xcite .",
    "however , in such models , the exponential of eqn .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) is usually multiplied by a polynomial in @xmath96 , or equivalently , in @xmath17 . in the multipolar scenario",
    ", @xmath170 corresponds to a dipole form factor , while @xmath171 represents a monopole . in any one fit",
    ", we do not choose all the form factors to have the same form .",
    "this means that , for instance , in the case of the decays to @xmath56 mesons , for which there are two form factors , the second scenario corresponds to sixteen different possible combinations of forms for @xmath115 and @xmath172 .    in each case , the @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the free parameters to be varied in the fit .",
    "there are therefore twelve free parameters in each fit , to be compared with five extracted and three assumed parameters in the measured semileptonic decays .",
    "since we have more free parameters than are extracted from the experimental data , one might expect that it should be very easy to account for all of the data .",
    "in fact , the number of free parameters poses some problems , as it means that the problem is not very well constrained .",
    "one consequence of this is that there appear to be several local minima for any particular choice of form factors . nevertheless , there are some combinations of form factors that simply do not provide adequate descriptions of the data , despite the large number of free parameters .",
    "when only the semileptonic decays are included in the fit , we find that almost any combination of forms for the form factors leads to reasonable results .",
    "the few combinations that do not provide good descriptions fail only in their description of the polarization observables .    when we use the exponential forms , we find that we are not able to obtain an adequate description of all of the data simultaneously . in particular ,",
    "when we include the nonleptonic decays in the fit , the prediction for the rare decay @xmath175 is significantly different from the measured rate . in some cases ,",
    "however , we find that if we fit the semileptonic decays alone , omitting all of the nonleptonic decays , the prediction for the rare decays is of the right order of magnitude .",
    "one possible conclusion here is that factorization is not applicable to these nonleptonic decays , or that there are significant non - factorizable contributions to the amplitude .",
    "in contrast with the exponentials of the first scenario , many combinations of the ` multipolar ' forms of the second scenario lead to good descriptions of all the data simultaneously .",
    "one outstanding feature of all of our results in this scenario ( which also exists in the exponential scenario , but to a lesser extent ) can be easily understood by examining eqn .",
    "( [ ff2 ] ) , where it is seen that @xmath176 is present in all of the form factors that describe the semileptonic decays @xmath177 .",
    "it is therefore not at all surprising that our results are most sensitive to this form factor .",
    "invariably , we have found that the best fits occur for @xmath178 linear in @xmath96 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath179 ) , independent of the forms chosen for the other form factors .",
    "furthermore , the slope parameter @xmath180 is almost always negative , with values lying between -0.4 and -0.65 gev@xmath181 .",
    "the only positive values for @xmath180 occur when only the semileptonic decays are included .",
    "the fact that @xmath176 is so well constrained in our fits means that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are also quite well constrained .",
    "since these are the only two form factors that are needed for the decay @xmath2 , it is no surprise that we find little variation in the predictions for this decay rate as we vary the parametrizations of @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 , provided that the choice of parametrization of @xmath176 is unchanged .    for other forms of @xmath176 , we find that at most two of the semileptonic , nonleptonic or rare decays are well accomodated .",
    "for instance , if we choose a monopole form for @xmath176 , then in addition to the semileptonic decays , we find that we can accomodate either the nonleptonic decays , the rare decay , but not both .",
    "in addition , if we choose all form factors to be monopolar , we fail to find adequate descriptions of the polarization observables , particularly for the ratio @xmath185 measured in the nonleptonic decay .",
    "our results for the form factors are comparable with those of other authors .",
    "@xcite have found that a number of scenarios , including monopolar form factors , are unable to describe the nonleptonic measurements .",
    "_ @xcite have found that softening the scaling relations allows an adequate description , while in a second article , gourdin _ et al . _ @xcite have found that allowing the form factor @xmath35 to decrease linearly with @xmath17 allows an adequate description of the data .",
    "we find that @xmath35 is quadratic in @xmath17 , but the absolute value at @xmath186 for the @xmath187 transitions is larger than the absolute value at @xmath188 , in keeping with the results of @xcite , and quite different from pole models .      for each scenario ,",
    "we have selected a set of fits that we consider to be representative .",
    "the parameters for these fits are displayed in table [ fitparame ] for the exponential forms , and in table [ fitparam ] for the multipolar forms . in the first scenario ,",
    "the results we have selected correspond to @xmath172 and @xmath182 as in eqn .",
    "( [ exp1 ] ) , @xmath115 and @xmath183 as in eqn .",
    "( [ exp2 ] ) , and @xmath184 and @xmath176 as in eqn .",
    "( [ exp3 ] ) . in the second scenario ,",
    "the @xmath189 have the values @xmath190 .",
    ".values of the parameters that result from four different fits , for the exponential scenario . in this table ,",
    "fit 1 means that only @xmath0 is included in the fit ; fit 2 means @xmath0 and @xmath191 are included ; fit 3 means @xmath0 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are included ; fit 4 means @xmath163 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath2 are all included , and applies only to decays with @xmath26 s in the final state .",
    "[ fitparame ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given the failure of the exponential scenario to explain the @xmath195 data , one might be tempted to discard its predictions for the dileptonic decays .",
    "however , we see that the integrated rates are , for the most part , quite similar to those predicted in the multipolar scenario .",
    "the spectra that result from the two scenarios are very different , however , and the predictions for the relative amount of longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized @xmath26 produced are also somewhat different .",
    "the exponential forms predict @xmath196 , while in the multipolar scenario , the ratio ranges between 0.15 and 0.24 .",
    "the moral here may be that the exponential forms may be adequate for predicting total rates , but not decay spectra , nor polarization observables .",
    "we limit our discussion to the multipolar scenario in what follows .    0.25 in    0.25 in    the predictions for the process @xmath197 are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than present experimental upper limits , while those for @xmath198 are smaller than the experimental limits by factors of four to six .",
    "we point out , however , that the calculated rates for these last two processes do not include possible contributions from charmonium resonances , which will certainly alter the shape of the lepton spectrum , and should also increase the total decay rate .",
    "an investigation of this effect will be left for a future article . however , in at least one experimental analysis , kinematic cuts are imposed on the total mass of the lepton pair , so that events that may arise from either of the first two vector charmonium resonances are excluded @xcite . in any case , our results suggest that the exclusive dileptonic decay to the @xmath26 should be observed in the near future .",
    "the results that we have obtained here again illustrate that the fit to the present @xmath15 semileptonic spectra alone is inadequate for providing information on @xmath187 processes .",
    "even when we include the nonleptonic decays , the predictions for different decay modes ( particularly @xmath199 with longitudinally polarized @xmath26 s ) are sensitive to the nonleptonic modes we include in the fit . if any of these predictions are to be taken seriously , we would suggest that most attention be paid to the predictions of fit 4 in the multipolar scenario , as this is the only scenario that adequately describes all of the data available .",
    "one of the features of the predicted spectra are the minima in the differential decay rates .",
    "these minima are the result of zeroes in the respective helicity amplitudes , and the question of whether or not these zeroes do indeed exist , and of their exact locations , will have to await a @xmath27-factory .",
    "however , long - distance effects , such as those that arise from charmonium resonances , or even from the charmonium continuum , will at least alter the positions of the zeroes , and may wash out the effect altogether .",
    "we have used the scaling predictions of hqet , together with the most recent data on @xmath0 semileptonic decays , to extract the form factors that describe the @xmath15 and @xmath14 processes .",
    "the latter we have applied to other processes , namely the nonleptonic decays @xmath200 and @xmath192 , as well as the rare decays @xmath11 and @xmath3 . in the case of",
    "the nonleptonic decays , we have assumed factorization of the transition amplitude is valid .",
    "we have also performed simultaneous fits of the semileptonic , nonleptonic and rare processes , and have found that hqet , together with factorization , provide an adequate framework for describing the observations .",
    "our predictions for the modes @xmath3 suggest that these should be measurable in the next generation of experiments , and certainly at the proposed @xmath27 factory .",
    "perhaps the greatest shortcoming of our fit procedure lies in how we handle the data , or simulated data , for the semileptonic decays .",
    "ideally , we should have attempted to fit our choices of form factors to the experimentally measured differential decay rates . as a second choice",
    ", our choices of form factors should have been input into the experimental monte - carlo programs to obtain the fit parameters . in any case , it is clear that the present data , particularly in the @xmath163 mode , are inadequate to sufficiently constrain the form factors .",
    "in addition , the differences in form factors between fit 1 and fits 2 , 3 and 4 are quite striking .",
    "the scenario that best describes all of the experimental data is the multipolar one , and in this scenario , we find that the universal form factor @xmath176 is linear in @xmath96 .",
    "using this scenario , we predict @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with other model calculations @xcite .",
    "we also predict @xmath203 in @xmath204 to be @xmath205 .",
    "to fully constrain the predictions of hqet , information on the form factors @xmath31 and @xmath30 is needed from the semileptonic decays .",
    "such information can only be obtained from high - precision measurements of the decay spectra at low values of @xmath17 , particularly for semileptonic decays to muons , as well as by measuring the polarization of the charged lepton , again preferably the muon .",
    "in addition , the precision and statistics in the @xmath17 spectrum must be improved so that the form factor parameters can be extracted from the data , particularly for the decays @xmath163 .",
    "perhaps the ideal experiment would be the equivalent of present cleo experiments , in which the machine is tuned to be a source of @xmath206 pairs , produced from the strong decays of the @xmath207 . for @xmath51 decays",
    ", the equivalent would be to produce a copious number of @xmath208 s , which can be realized at the proposed tau - charm factory .",
