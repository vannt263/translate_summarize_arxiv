    "the observed universe is surprisingly well described by a simple friedmann - robertson - walker model that is characterized by a handful of well - measured global parameters .",
    "together with the gravitational instability theory for the formation of structure , a `` concordance model '' has emerged that does not seem to conflict with any firmly established observations . of course , the physical nature of most of the gravitating matter and energy remains elusive , except that most of the dark matter must be of the cold variety to avoid excessive free streaming in the early universe that would suppress small - scale power of the observed matter distribution . in the framework of this standard paradigm ,",
    "the observed power spectrum of the cosmic matter distribution provides restrictive limits on the hot dark matter fraction of the cosmological matter  cocktail  @xcite .    taking advantage of the latest cosmological data , notably the 2df and sdss galaxy redshift surveys and the wmap measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations , several authors have used this argument to derive restrictive neutrino mass limits of @xmath31.0  ev ( 95% cl ) @xcite .",
    "the exact value of the nominal limit depends on the included data sets and on the assumed priors for some of the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the small spread between different nominal limits suggests that the universe is a robust laboratory for constraining the overall neutrino mass scale , and perhaps eventually for positively determining its value @xcite .",
    "of course , these limits or a future positive detection depend on the validity of the standard cosmological paradigm .",
    "for example , the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations may not follow a simple power law , modifying all of these results .",
    "still , very recently it was shown that the neutrino mass limit is surprisingly robust against a contribution of nonadiabatic , incoherent fluctuations such as would be predicted by topological defects  @xcite .",
    "we are here concerned with a different extension of the standard picture in that we study the effect of a non - standard number density of neutrinos , perhaps caused by the existence of additional neutrinos such as sterile states , or new low - mass particles such as axions .",
    "one of us has previously shown that increasing the assumed number density of neutrinos actually _ weakens _ the mass limit , contrary to naive intuition , because the increased radiation density counteracts the effect of the increased hot dark matter fraction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the usual neutrino mass limits do not trivially translate into more general cases where the hot dark matter fraction and the radiation content are varied independently .",
    "the free - streaming effect of low - mass particles on the power spectrum of the matter distribution and of the cmb temperature fluctuations depends on the particle mass @xmath4 , their number density and velocity distribution , and on the radiation content in other degrees of freedom that do not carry mass .",
    "we will consider two generic classes of cases .",
    "one covers neutrinos , i.e.fermionic degrees of freedom with a momentum distribution given by that of ordinary neutrinos .",
    "we vary the mass @xmath5 , the effective number of flavors carrying that mass , and the effective number of massless flavors .",
    "our second generic case is that of particles that were once in thermal equilibrium ( thermal relics ) so that their contribution to the hot dark matter fraction and their velocity distribution is perfectly defined by the cosmic temperature @xmath6 when they thermally decoupled from the background medium , by their mass , and by their number of internal degrees of freedom .    in sec .  2 we describe our general methodology for deriving the allowed range of non - standard cosmological parameters .",
    "3 we apply our method to various scenarios involving active and sterile neutrinos . in sec .",
    "4 we consider general thermal relics , and finally we conclude in sec .  5 .",
    "in order to derive limits on the parameters characterizing the new particles we compare theoretical power spectra for the matter distribution and the cmb temperature fluctuations with observational data in analogy to the previous works by one of us  @xcite .",
    "the predicted power spectra are calculated with the publicly available cmbfast package  @xcite .",
    "this package allows one to include directly the effective number of massless neutrino degrees of freedom and of neutrinos carrying a mass as well as the cosmic hot dark matter fraction , assumed to be equally distributed among the massive flavors .",
    "put another way , the standard version of the code assumes a velocity distribution of the neutrinos that ordinary active neutrinos with a mass would have . for our more general case of arbitrary thermal relics we modified the code accordingly .    as a set of cosmological parameters apart from the new particle characteristics we choose the matter density @xmath7 , the baryon density @xmath8 , the hubble parameter @xmath9 , the scalar spectral index of the primordial fluctuation spectrum @xmath10 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath11 , the normalization of the cmb power spectrum @xmath12 , and the bias parameter  @xmath13 .",

    "the cosmological parameters in our model corresponds to the simplest @xmath17cdm model which fits present data .",
    "while our results would be changed slightly by including additional parameters , there would be no qualitative changes .",
    "the neutrino mass is mainly degenerate with the matter density , the bias parameter , and to a lesser extent with the hubble parameter , but not for instance with the curvature  @xcite .",

    "a value for @xmath37 much larger than 3 contradicts the observed primordial helium abundance in the framework of the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) theory .",
    "however , if the primordial @xmath41 chemical potential takes on a suitable value , its effect on the @xmath42 freeze - out abundance can always compensate for the expansion - rate effect caused by the additional flavors .",
    "such a fine - tuned @xmath41 degeneracy parameter may not seem particularly plausible , but it serves as one possibility to escape the bbn limits . in any event , we think it is useful to study what can be learned about neutrino parameters from large - scale structure data alone , without combining this information with data pertaining to an entirely different cosmological epoch .",
    "since we know that the number of ordinary neutrino flavors is exactly 3 , the additional degrees of freedom would have to be sterile states , perhaps dirac partners of the ordinary neutrinos that were thermally equilibrated by some unknown mechanism .    without sterile states , in principle",
    "the effective @xmath37 can be enhanced by suitable neutrino chemical potentials for the ordinary flavors .",
    "however , the observed neutrino mixing parameters imply that all three standard flavors reach full thermal equilibrium ( i.e.kinetic and chemical equilibrium ) before the bbn epoch so that the restrictive bbn limit on the @xmath41 degeneracy parameter applies to all flavors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , interpreting @xmath43 in terms of an increased density of the ordinary flavors requires some unspecified way to escape the bbn limits .",
    "we also note that our treatment assumes a neutrino velocity distribution corresponding to a non - degenerate thermal distribution .",
