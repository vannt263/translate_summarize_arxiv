    "identification or parameter estimation is one of the most important and interesting fields in the nonlinear dynamics and time series analysis .",
    "there exist many methods of identifying the parameters of a nonlinear stochastic system such as maximum likelihood estimators and bayes estimators @xcite .",
    "especially this latter is related to the sequential monte carlo methods @xcite which are also known as particle filter methods introduced by gordon et al .",
    "these methods utilize a large number of random samples ( or particles ) to represent the posterior probability distributions .",
    "the particles are propagated over time using a combination of sequential importance sampling and resampling steps . at each time",
    "step the resampling procedure statistically multiplies and/or discards particles to adaptively concentrate particles in regions of high posterior probability .",
    "+ particle filter methods are usually applied to state space models to approximate the posterior probability distributions of the state given the available observation .",
    "if the state space models contain a set of unknown parameters which are to be estimated then one can include them in the model by augmenting the state vector @xcite .",
    "+ as an alternative method for estimating parameters of continuous hidden diffusion processes we propose a hidden markov models ( hmms ) @xcite approach which model both the signal and noise simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this is based on the approximation of continuous systems by discrete models .",
    "the underlying signal is assumed to be generated by a discrete markov chain .",
    "the latter uses the joint probability of the sequence of the discrete observation samples as the likelihood function .",
    "the general theory of hmms was established by baum et al . in the sixties @xcite .",
    "+ standard hmms rely on the baum - welch reestimation procedure to optimize the likelihood function @xcite .",
    "the standard baum - welch algorithm suffers from the problem that it may converge to a local minimum .",
    "however , we can overcome this difficulty by parameterizing the transition matrix @xcite .",
    "+ previous works have shown that hidden markov models are successful tools for modeling and classifying dynamic behaviors .",
    "for example , hmms are used for analyzing biological sequences @xcite , speech recognition @xcite , ion channel analysis @xcite , and to detect different modes of neuronal activity @xcite .",
    "+ in experimental physics , the objective of any measurement is to determine the value of the particular quantity to be measured . in general",
    ", however , the result of a measurement is only an approximation or estimate of the value one is looking for .",
    "for instance in coupled josephson junctions @xcite , direct measurements of the time dependence of the voltage are usually impossible because the characteristic time scale of voltage variations is too short ( @xmath0 picoseconds ) .",
    "one can usually measure the josephson radiation emission in some narrow frequency range , which can show chaotic behaviour .",
    "but in this case one can not see higher harmonics which are required to fully reconstruct the voltage time evolution . in experiments ,",
    "another version of the voltage is usually measured which is the results of the low pass filtering . the obtained voltage is used to extract the current - voltage characteristic . in this case , the observed variable is the voltage whereas the josephson phase is hidden .",
    "likharev @xcite reported that the coupled josephson junctions belong to a class of complex systems .",
    "the corresponding experimental works show that it is difficult to estimate some of the parameters characterizing the josephson device , e.g. the damping related to the fluctuation of the temperature and the maximal josephson current .",
    "+ for the case that the measured time series proved to be approximately markovian , friedrich et al @xcite proposed an approach to obtain the drift and diffusion of one - dimensional langevin equations from the time series .",
    "this is based on the finite - difference form of their definition together with suitable interpolations of the resulting trends .",
    "ragwitz et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a correction of this approach to reduce the errors due to a finite times step .",
    "this was controversy for the case of directly observed states of continuous diffusion processes , which were measured in discrete time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we believe that our approach can then be used to clarify this situation . + this paper is devoted to a numerical evaluation of these two methods by applying them , for instance , to the problem of diffusion in periodic potentials with noisy observations .",
    "the latter example is taken as a periodic function of the coordinate of the diffusing state .",
    "the aim of this work is to estimate the drift coefficient and the diffusion constant .",

    "the procedure may have several drawbacks if it is applied to the problem of diffusion in periodic potentials with noisy observations .",
