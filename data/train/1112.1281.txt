    "all known life forms are composed of basic units called _ cells _ ; this holds true from the single - cell prokaryote bacterium to the highly sophisticated eucaryotes , whose existence is the result of the coordination , in term of self - organization and emergence , of the behavior of each single basic unit .",
    "while present day cells are endowed with highly sophisticated regulatory mechanisms , that represent the outcome of almost four billion - years of evolution , it is generally believed that the first life - forms were much simpler .",
    "such primordial life - bricks , the _ protocells _ , were most probably exhibiting only few simplified functionalities , that required a primitive embodiment structure , a protometabolism and a rudimentary genetics , so to guarantee that offsprings were similar  to their parents  @xcite .",
    "intense research programs are being established aiming at obtaining protocells capable of growth and duplication , endowed with some limited form of genetics  @xcite . despite all efforts , artificial protocells have not yet been reproduced in laboratory and it is thus extremely important to develop reference models  @xcite that capture the essence of the first protocells appeared on earth and enable to monitor their subsequent evolution . due to the uncertainties about the details , high - level abstract models",
    "are particularly relevant . quoting kaneko  @xcite it is necessary to consider simplified models able to capture universal behaviors , without carefully adding complicating details .",
    "most of the models present in the literature are based on deterministic differential equations governing the evolution of the concentrations of the involved reacting molecules .",
    "even if the results are worth discussing and provide important insights , it should be stressed that the former assumptions are rarely satisfied in a cell  @xcite .",
    "firstly , the number of involved molecules is small and should be counted by integer numbers , hence the use of the concentrations can be questioned ; secondly , the presence of the thermal noise introduces in the system a degree of stochasticity than can not be trivially encoded by a differential equation , mostly because this makes the time evolution a stochastic process .",
    "one possible way to overcome such difficulties is to use the chemical master equation : given the present state of the system , namely the number of available molecules for each species , and the possible reactions among them , one can compute the transition probabilities to reach and leave the given state and thus get a partial differential equation describing the time evolution of the probability distribution of having a given number of molecules at any future times  @xcite .    analytically solving",
    "the resulting equation is normally a very hard task , one should thus resort to use numerical methods .",
    "a particularly suitable one is the algorithm presented by gillespie  @xcite , allowing to determine , as a function of the present state of the system , the most probable reaction and the most probable reaction time , i.e. the time at which such reaction will occur .",
    "let us however observe that in the setting we are hereby interested in , the chemical reactions occur in a varying volume , because of the protocell growth ; we thus need to adapt the gillespie method to account for this factor . to the best of our knowledge , there are in the literature very few papers dealing with the gillespie algorithm in a varying volume  @xcite .",
    "moreover in all these papers , the volume variation can be considered as an exogenous factor , not being directly related to the number of lipids forming the protocell membrane .",
    "so our main contribution is to improve the gillespie algorithm taking into account the protocell varying volume which is moreover consistent with the increase of the number of lipids constituting the protocell membrane .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section  [ sec : srm ] we briefly recall the surface reaction models of protocell , that would be used to compare our stochastic numerical scheme .",
    "then in sections  [ sec : meth ] and  [ sec : algo ] we will present our implementation of the gillespie algorithm in a dynamically varying volume . finally in section  [ sec : app ] we will present some applications of our method .",
    "among the available models for protocells , a particularly interesting one is the surface reactions model  @xcite , srm for short , and its applicability to the synchronization problem .",
    "such model is roughly inspired by the los alamos bug hypothesis  @xcite but which , due to its abstraction level , the srm can be applied to a wider set of protocell hypotheses .",
    "the srm is build on the assumption that a protocell should comprise at least one kind of container  molecule ( typically a lipid or amphiphile ) , hereby called @xmath0 molecule , and one kind of replicator molecule - loosely speaking genetic material , hereafter called genetic memory molecule , gmm for short , and named with the letter @xmath1 .",
    "there are therefore two kinds of reactions which are crucial for the working of the protocell : those which synthesize the container molecules eq .   and those which synthesize the gmm replicators eq .",
    "@xmath2    @xmath3    in both cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the buffered precursors , respectively of container molecules and of the @xmath6th gmm , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the reaction kinetic constants .",
    "a second main assumption of the srm , is that such reactions occur on the _ surface _ of the protocell , exposed to the external medium where precursors are free to move .",
    "hence , as long as container molecules are produced , they are incorporated in the membrane that thus increases its size , until a critical point at which , due to physical instabilities , the membrane splits and two offsprings are obtained , each one getting half of the mother s gmms and whose size is roughly half that of the mother just before the division .    under the previous assumptions and in the deterministic setting , one can prove  @xcite that the number of membrane molecules and the number of gmms evolve in time according to : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the amount of each gmm , @xmath11 is the vector of the reaction constants responsible for the production of @xmath0 molecules from the @xmath1 molecules plus some appropriate precursor .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the reaction constant at which @xmath13 is produced by @xmath14 plus some precursor .",
    "@xmath15 $ ] is a geometrical shape factor that relates the surface to the volume of the protocell and @xmath16 is the lipid density ( for more details the interested reader can consult  @xcite ) .",
    "let us observe that in this setting the precursors are assumed to be buffered and thus their amount to be constant , hence the latter can be incorporated into the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so starting with a initial value of container molecules , @xmath19 , and of gmms , @xmath20 , the protocell will grow until some time @xmath21 at which the amount of @xmath0 molecules has doubled with respect to the initial value , @xmath22 and thus the protocell undergoes a division .",
    "each offspring will get half of the gmms the mother protocell had just before the division , @xmath23 .",
    "and the protocell cycle starts once again .",
    "one can prove  @xcite that under suitable conditions @xmath24 tends to a constant value once @xmath25 goes to infinity , implying thus the emergence of synchronization of growth and information production .",
    "let us now improve the previous scheme by introducing a probabilistic setting _",
    " la gillespie_. we thus consider a protocell made by a lipidic vesicle and containing a well stirred mixture of @xmath26 gmms , @xmath27 , that may react through @xmath28 elementary reaction channels @xmath29 , @xmath30 , running within the volume @xmath31 of the protocell .",
    "let us observe that because of the protocell growth the volume is an increasing function of time .",
    "actually one can relate the volume to the amount of container molecules via their density @xmath32 where @xmath0 denotes the integer number of molecules forming the lipidic membrane .",
    "we will hereby use the same symbol @xmath13 to denote both the @xmath33th gmm and the integer number of molecules of type @xmath13 in the system .    for each reaction channel",
    "@xmath29 assume that there exists a scalar rate @xmath34 such that @xmath35 is the probability that a random combination of molecules from channel @xmath29 will react in the interval @xmath36 within the volume @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the total number of possible distinct combinations of molecules for a channel @xmath29 when the system is in state @xmath38 , then we can define the _ propensity _  @xcite of the reaction @xmath29 to be @xmath39 .",
    "one can prove  @xcite that for a binary reaction the rate @xmath34 can be written in the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a fixed constant .",
    "similarly one can prove that for a reaction involving @xmath25 different species , we get : @xmath42 .",
    "and thus for a single molecule reaction , i.e. a decay , we get @xmath43 , namely independently from the volume .",
    "let us now assume that among the @xmath28 reactions , @xmath44 involve one single molecule , @xmath45 are binary reactions , @xmath46 are ternary reactions and so on .",
    "of course @xmath47 .",
    "we recall that we have @xmath26 gmms and the container type molecule @xmath0 , hence @xmath48 species . for short we will denote @xmath49 the set of indices @xmath50 for mono molecule reactions , and by @xmath51 the remaining ones .",
    "let us observe that in this way some coefficient @xmath52 , will depend both on the system state @xmath53 and on the time via the volume @xmath31 : @xmath54 for @xmath55 .    more precisely to study the time evolution of the system we need to determine the probability @xmath56 , that given the system in the state @xmath57 at time @xmath58 , then the next reaction will occur in the infinitesimal time interval @xmath59 and it will be the reaction @xmath29 .",
    "this probability will be computed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the probability that no reaction occurs in @xmath62 given the state @xmath53 at time @xmath58 , whereas the rightmost term denotes the probability to have a reaction @xmath29 in @xmath63 given the state @xmath53 at time @xmath64 .    to compute the first term @xmath65 ,",
    "let us take @xmath66 $ ] and observe that : @xmath67 being @xmath68 the probability that no reaction will occur in @xmath69 once we are in state @xmath53 at time @xmath70 . thus rewriting the previous difference equation as a differential equation , passing to the limit @xmath71 , and observing that @xmath72 , we get the solution : @xmath73\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 the apparent asymmetry in the exponential term in   is easily recovered by observing that @xmath75 .",
    "we can thus conclude that @xmath76 a_{\\mu}(y , t+\\tau)d\\tau\\ , .\\ ] ] let us observe that the rightmost term is correctly @xmath77 , namely the system is still in the state @xmath53 at time @xmath64 , because no reaction has been produced in @xmath62 .",
    "let us recall that the volume enters in the previous relation via the function @xmath78 , more explicitely one has @xmath79 that can be rewritten in terms of @xmath0 molecules using the relation @xmath80 .",
    "so our method applies to a different problem with respect to the one considered in  @xcite , in fact in our case the volume growth is not imposed a priori but dynamically evolves accordingly to the reaction scheme , if @xmath0 is produced then @xmath81 increases otherwise it will keep a constant value , while in  @xcite the volume growth is an exogenous variable .",
    "once we have the probability function @xmath82 we can build an algorithm that reproduces the time evolution given by the model defined above .    given the system in some state @xmath53 at time @xmath58 , we must determine the interval of time @xmath83 and the reaction channel @xmath29 according to the probability distribution function @xmath82 , and finally update the state @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a stoichiometric vector representing the increase and decrease of molecular abundance due to the reaction @xmath29 .",
    "this will be accomplished following the standard approach by gillespie  @xcite but taking care of the time dependence of the propensities .",
    "we will thus need to compute the cumulative probability distribution function and then make use of the inversion method  @xcite , to determine the channel @xmath50 and the next reaction time @xmath83 , distributed according to @xmath82 .",
    "from   we can compute the _ cumulative distribution function _ @xmath86 providing the probability that any reaction will occur in @xmath62 starting from the state @xmath53 at time @xmath58 .",

    "one can nevertheless found suitable approximation for the integral , this will be the goal of the next sections .",
    "let assume that @xmath83 is very small , or which is equivalent , that the time scale of the chemical reactions involving the gmms is much faster than the production of container molecules , hence the volume growth is very slow compared with the production of the chemicals @xmath13 .",
    "under this hypothesis one can assume that in the interval @xmath62 the volume does nt vary and thus one can made the following approximation @xmath95    one can thus explicitely solve equation   to get : @xmath96 that is the standard gillespie result except now that @xmath97 depends on time and as long the volume increases , then the contribution arising form @xmath97 mights become smaller because @xmath98 .",
    "one can obtain a somehow better estimate valid in the case of comparable time scales for the reactions involving gmm and the container growth .",
    "the idea is to compute the integral in eq .   using the following approximation : @xmath99 where @xmath100 can be obtained using the definition   and expressing the volume in terms of @xmath101 , namely : @xmath102 to compute @xmath103 we make the assumption that in a very short time interval , as the one we are interested in , the deterministic growth of the container is a good approximation for the stochastic underlying mechanism ; this implies that we can use   @xmath104    inserting the previous result into   and finally solving   with respect to @xmath83",
    ", we can compute the next reaction time up to correction of the order of @xmath105 , as : @xmath106 where we wrote for short @xmath107 and we selected the positive square root in such a way in the limit @xmath108 we recover the previous solution  .    in the case of variable volume",
    "a new phenomenon can arise : the volume growth can be so fast that no reaction can occur in the interval @xmath109 for any @xmath83 .",
    "mathematically this translates into a sign condition for the term under square root in  , if : @xmath110 then equation   has no real solution .",
    "this can be geometrically interpreted as follows .",
    "the relation   determines @xmath111 as the intersection of the parabola @xmath112 with the horizontal line @xmath113 , which is negative because @xmath114 .",
    "such parabola intersect the @xmath115-axis at @xmath116 and @xmath117 and it is concave .",
    "then its absolute ( negative ) minimum is reached at the vertex @xmath118 and its value is @xmath119 and it is negative because @xmath120 is negative .",
    "hence if the horizontal line is below this value , i.e. condition   is verified , the parabola and the line do not have any real intersections ( see fig .",

    "the non existence of such next reaction time could be translated into the death by dilution of the protocell .",
    "whenever the next reaction time does exist , the next reaction channel is determined using the classical gillespie method , namely by drawing a second uniformly distributed random number @xmath121 $ ] and fix the channel @xmath50 such that : @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "[ rem : novoldep ] let us observe that if all the reactions involve the same number of chemicals , then the determination of which reaction channel @xmath50 will be activated in the next reaction , does nt depend on the volume which factorizes out from  .",
