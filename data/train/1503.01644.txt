    "five phases of the large - scale universe are imprinted on hydrogen : ( i ) the primordial phase before redshift @xmath9when the universe was a hot , dense plasma  that ended when protons recombined with electrons releasing the photons that we detect today as a @xmath10 k signal known as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ; ( ii ) the ` dark ages ' ( @xmath11 ) when the baryonic universe contained mostly neutral hydrogen and freely moving photons ; ( iii ) the ` cosmic dawn ' ( @xmath12 ) when the first structures formed ; ( iv ) the ` epoch of reionization ' ( eor ; @xmath13 ) when high - energy photons emitted by the first sources reionized the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ; and ( v ) the current phase ( @xmath14 ) when almost all hydrogen in the universe are ionized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aforementioned highly uncertain boundaries of the eor have been approximated using indirect probes , e.g. cmb polarization at the high-@xmath15 end ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and absorption features in quasar spectra at the low-@xmath15 end ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the new generation low - frequency , wide - bandwidth radio interferometers have the potential to directly detect the 21-cm radiation emitted by neutral hydrogen during the eor , redshifted to the wavelengths of around 1.53 m ( corresponding to 200100 mhz ) , as a differential brightness with respect to the cmb .",
    "there are several ongoing and planned experiments to detect the eor signal using radio arrays : giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , low frequency array ( lofar ) , murchison widefield array ( mwa ) , precision array for probing the eor ( paper ) , 21-cm array ( 21cma ) , and the planned square kilometre array ( ska ) .    in order to detect the eor ,",
    "the effect of all other signals , e.g. the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds , has to be excluded from the observed data ; spatial fluctuations of the galactic foreground can be 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the eor signal @xcite which is around 10 mk within the redshifts 610 at @xmath16 resolution @xcite .",
    "however , even after removing the foregrounds with high accuracy the system noise after even hundreds of hours of integration will be an order of magnitude higher than the signal , thereby forcing us to aim for a statistical detection of the signal .",
    "one of the methods for detecting the eor signal statistically entails removing the foregrounds with high accuracy and then measuring the power spectrum of the residual which depends heavily on a proper understanding of the systematic and the random ( noise ) errors associated with the observing instrument and foreground removal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we address the systematic errors due to polarized foregrounds associated with the eor experiment being conducted using lofar ( the lofar - eor project ) . after taking out the bright extragalactic foreground , i.e. the resolved point sources ,",
    "the galactic foreground can be removed utilizing the fact that the eor signal has significant correlated structure along the frequency  or equivalently the redshift  axis while the galactic diffuse foreground is spectrally smooth in stokes @xmath0 .",
    "however , the faraday rotated polarized galactic foreground is not always smooth along frequency and hence a leakage of the polarized emission into stokes @xmath0 might mimic the eor signal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "systematic errors can cause this leakage in two different ways : direction independent ( di ) and direction dependent ( dd ) .",
    "non - orthogonal or rotated feeds of an antenna of an interferometer can cause @xmath17 to leak into @xmath0 and vice versa while cross - talk between two feeds can cause mixing between all 4 stokes parameters .",
    "as these are di errors , they can be corrected with high accuracy using traditional self - calibration .",
    "however , the dd errors ( dde ) caused by the time - frequency - baseline dependent primary beams can not be corrected so easily . in the latter case ,",
    "an ellipticity of the beam can cause @xmath18 mixing while cross - polarization between two orthogonal components of the beam can mix all stokes parameters .",
    "@xcite calculated a full polarization mueller matrix to account for the look - direction dependent polarization aberration inherent in a dipole interferometer due to the fact that a source sees different projections of a dipole at different times .",
    "@xcite used this mueller matrix to calculate the amount of leakage to be expected over the field of view of lofar and found that the leakage should be 0.1 - 0.7% at 138 mhz within a @xmath19 patch of sky around the zenith and should increase to 2 - 20% for an elevation of @xmath20 .",
    "if the polarized intensity is @xmath21 k , then a 1.5% leakage would give a polarized emission of @xmath22 mk in stokes @xmath0 which is comparable to the eor signal .",
    "@xcite simulated the sky with randomly generated faraday rotated , polarized point sources and found that the power of @xmath23 leakage due to the model beam of paper that has a fwhm of around @xmath20 at 150 mhz is of the order of thousands of [ mk]@xmath24 which is several orders of magnitude higher than the expected eor signal power .",
    "their result turned out to be pessimistic because of their choice of the model ; in reality , point sources are much more weakly polarized at low frequencies @xcite .    here , we predict the level of polarization leakage to be expected in the 3c196 window of the lofar - eor experiment using reasonable models of the field and the model beam of lofar produced by @xcite using an electromagnetic simulation of the astron antenna group , and also test some leakage - correction strategies .",

    "[ f : ps3dc]h ) in this case almost no leakage was removed , not even in the relatively high snr region .",
    "antennas for the future arrays like ska , that have eor detection as one of the main scientific objectives , are being designed in such a way that their polarimetric performance is good enough to be able to minimize the effects of polarization leakage ( de lera acedo ; private communication ) .",
    "a recently proposed figure of merit for quantifying the polarimetric performance is the _ intrinsic cross - polarization ratio _ ( ixr )",
    "which , in mueller formalism , can be directly related to the instrumental polarization ( * ? ? ?",
    "our lofar results show an instrumental polarization of around 0.3% ( fig .",
    "[ f : ps3dc]e ; ignoring @xmath146 leakage ) within the fwhm of the nominal station beams , i.e. within a fov of @xmath77 .",
    "this corresponds to an ixr@xmath302 ( _ mueller ixr _ ) of 25 db , or equivalently an ixr@xmath303 ( _ jones ixr _ ; see eq .",
    "25 of @xcite ) of 56 db , and if the leakage can be reduced by 70% , ixr@xmath302 will improve to 35 db .",
    "therefore , we can say that if ska has a minimum ixr@xmath302 of 25 db within the central @xmath304 of its nominal station beams , then even a modest polarimetric calibration ( @xmath305 leakage removal ) will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the expected eor signal at the scales of 0.021 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "however , if the ixr@xmath302 is lower within a fov of @xmath276 , more leakage needs to be removed to reach the same level as before in relation to the eor signal in the power spectra , e.g. if the ixr@xmath302 is 20 db , 91% leakage has to be removed , and if it is 15 db , 97% has to be removed .",
    "the major conclusions of this paper are the following .",
    "1 .   two properties of the polarization leakage can be utilized for its removal in this specific case : it appears around a faraday depth of 0 rad / m@xmath24 in rm - space and the overall variation of the rms of the fractional leakage in the instrumental @xmath244-space is less than a factor of 2 .",
    "2 .   in the cylindrically",
    "averaged 3d power spectra , a clear ` eor window ' can be defined in terms of polarization leakage above the wedge and below @xmath5 mpc@xmath4 . within this window",
    ", the eor signal dominates the polarization leakage and the window takes up the whole @xmath244-space at @xmath306 after removing 70% of the leakage .",
    "3 .   a dde - blind foreground removal method like",
    "gmca is not ideal for removing leakage of diffuse polarized emission , as the level of leakage is lower than the current noise level in the lofar observations .",
