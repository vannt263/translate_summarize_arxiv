    "low metallicity systems ( or metal - poor systems ) are low mass emission - line galaxies with  roughly in the range 7.2 - 8.1 , where o / h is the oxygen to hydrogen number density ratio .",
    "they are referred to in the literature as dwarf irregular galaxies ( dis ) , their bursting derivatives , blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) , or h ii galaxies , a subclass of bcgs dominated in the optical by h ii region - like spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we use oxygen as a measure of metallicity in the above systems because it is the most abundant metal in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and because its abundance can be easily determined from the emission - lines present in their optical spectra . note that if we adopt @xmath5 = 8.66  @xmath2 0.05 for the solar value @xcite , then low metallicity systems have o / h in the range solar/30-solar/4 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to the value of i zw 18 , which is the most metal - poor dwarf galaxy ever observed .",
    "the upper limit ensures that the most metal rich objects are still below the onset of the observed n / o increase with o / h .",
    "in addition , objects with  below 8.1 have sufficient strength in the auroral line   @xmath6 , which is necessary in order to determine the electron temperatures required to obtain n / o .    in the log(n / o ) versus  diagram ( e.g. , fig . 2 of @xcite ) ,",
    "low metallicity systems form what is known as the primary n / o plateau . for these objects ,",
    "n / o is independent of o / h as is expected for the ratio of two primary elements .",
    "the analysis of the properties of this plateau plays an important role in understanding the process of primary nitrogen production , which is essential for determining the stellar mass range most responsible for n - production , constraining stellar n - yields ( in particular for massive stars ) , obtaining information about the initial mass function ( imf ) of galaxies , and perfecting galactic chemical evolution models . note that although one could think of other candidates for studying n / o at low metallicities , such as stars in metal - poor globular clusters , galactic halo stars , or damped ly@xmath7 systems , which are quasar radiation absorbers with o / h @xmath8 solar/10 , it is much harder to measure n and o abundances in such systems .",
    "this explains why the bulk of the n / o data are from low metallicity systems .",
    "there is disagreement among authors on the vertical thickness of the plateau and on the origin of its properties .",
    "@xcite called attention to the large scatter in n / o at fixed o / h .",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , found that the plateau is narrow , with a dispersion of only @xmath2 0.02 dex in log(n / o ) , for objects with  @xmath9 7.6 .",
    "in addition , the latter authors explained the plateau in terms of primary nitrogen from rapidly evolving massive stars ( m @xmath10 8 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite concluded that these objects are dominated by primary nitrogen from intermediate mass stars , which have masses in the range 4 - 8 m@xmath5 and evolve much slower .    in order to correctly interpret the plateau properties ,",
    "it is important to up - date the techniques employed to determine the n / o values .",
    "this can be accomplished through modeling . in particular ,",
    "simulations are required to obtain n / o for two reasons .",
    "firstly , they are necessary for finding parameterizations for the electron temperatures of the regions where n@xmath11 and o@xmath11 are emitting , i.e. ,  and . unfortunately , because the strengths of the auroral features  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 are commonly unavailable in observational data , the above temperatures can not be obtained from emission - line flux ratios of the form , nebular line(s ) / auroral line(s ) , although they are required in order to determine the abundances of the above two ions . since photoionization models can provide the auroral lines missing from observations , these lines can be used in turn to compute , , and , independent of each other .",
    "because objects with oxygen abundances below 8.1 usually have sufficient strength in the auroral line [ o iii ] @xmath6 ,  can be directly determined from the observed temperature sensitive line flux ratio @xmath14 @xcite . in general , a parameterization of the form  =  = _ f _ [ ] , inferred from models ,",
    "is used to compute n / o at low o / h ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "examples of this type of relation , based on photoionization models by @xcite , can be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "a more recent parameterization based on models by @xcite is used in @xcite , although the stellar spectra used as input to these models reflect the state - of - the - art in 1995 .",
    "in addition , the lowest stellar atmosphere metallicity that they used is solar/10 .",
    "ever since , more complete synthetic stellar spectra have been published for metallicities as low as solar/20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "parameterizations of the form  =  _ f@xmath15 _ [ ] and  =  _ f@xmath16 _ [ ] for systems with metallicities as low as that of i zw 18 should be obtained and compared to each other , using results from up - to - date stellar and nebular models .",
    "secondly , models are required for finding the ionization correction factor ( icf ) necessary for obtaining n / o from n@xmath11/o@xmath11 . based on simulations described in garnett & shields ( 1987 ) , which make use of mihalas ( 1972 ) and kurucz ( 1975 , 1979 ) stellar atmospheres with effective temperatures ranging from 38 kk to 55 kk",
    ", @xcite showed that 0.8 @xmath17 ( n / o)/ ( ) @xmath17 1.0 in ionized nebulae with one - tenth @xcite solar abundances .",
    "more recently , @xcite confirmed that",
    "n / o @xmath18  is a reasonable approximation in metal - poor h ii galaxies .",
    "they established this using photoionization models of @xcite with input stellar spectra generated with the stellar atmosphere code _",
    "@xcite , as well as simulations computed with the evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 @xcite , using @xcite stellar spectra generated with  @xcite .",
    "note that the spectra of @xcite are available for metallicities down to z@xmath5/20 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty in the icf is not given in @xcite , however , the value of the icf is sensitive to the ionization parameter q(h ) / [ 4 @xmath19 r@xmath20 n(h ) c ] , where , r@xmath21 is the distance from the ionizing source to the illuminated face of the cloud , n(h ) is the total hydrogen density , c is the speed of light , and q(h ) is the stellar emission rate of hydrogen ionizing photons @xcite . ] .",
    "this parameter is a poorly constrained variable ( e.g. , log(u ) ranges from -5 to -1 in models by @xcite ) .",
    "note that more recently , @xcite found that only a small range for u can fit the emission - line diagnostics from the few h ii galaxies that they modeled .",
    "however , as these authors conclude , u is yet to be observationally constrained .",
    "in addition , the value of the icf also depends on the method employed to compute .",
    "in particular , if the latter is derived from optical line flux ratios , the icf will depend on the temperatures used to derive the /  and /  ratios .",
    "our goal is to re - derive n and o abundances for a carefully selected sample of 68 low - metallicity systems whose de - reddened optical emission - line strengths were taken from the literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was accomplished using independent temperature parameterizations for  and  ( which diverge at low metallicities , see below ) and applying an icf for obtaining n / o from .",
    "our temperature patameterizations and icf are based on results from a representative grid of photoionization models computed with the code  version 96.01 @xcite .",
    "these employ state - of - the - art modeled stellar spectra that we generated with  version 13.08.04a @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our work is to carefully study the morphology of the n / o plateau , assess the uncertainites , and then quantify the amount of natural scatter among plateau objects .",
    "we discuss our general procedure for deriving the number density ratios o / h and n / o from optical emission - lines in   [ sec : gprocedure ] . in ",
    "[ sec : conditions ] we describe our models and explain how we obtained the electron temperatures , electron density , and icf relevant to the above abundance determinations .",
    "our method for determining abundance uncertainties is explained in   [ sec : abundances ] , in which we also compare our abundances with literature results . in section   [ sec : analysis ] we analyze the scatter in the n / o plateau .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] gives a summary of our work . in a companion paper to this one ( henry et al .",
    "2006 ) , chemical evolution models are combined with monte carlo techniques to further interpret the plateau morphology .",
    "the n and o ionic abundances for our sample of low metallicity systems were determined directly from published optical emission - lines using the general expression : @xmath22 where the fraction on the left is the number density ratio of the n or o ion relative to h@xmath11 , the first fraction on the right is the line flux ratio of a nebular forbidden feature of ion x@xmath23 relative to the strength of h@xmath24 ,  is the electron density ( @xmath25 ) ,  is the electron temperature of the region where the relevant ion is emitting ( k ) , @xmath26 is the effective recombination coefficient of h@xmath24 which includes radiative and three - body processes ( @xmath27 s@xmath28 ) , @xmath29 is the fraction of ions x@xmath23 with an electron in the upper level of the transition of interest , a@xmath30 is the corresponding spontaneous de - excitation rate coefficient ( s@xmath28 ) , and the last term is the wavelength ratio of the line of interest and h@xmath24 (  ) . note that equation  ( [ eq : ionabun ] ) is based on the assumption that h@xmath24 arises from recombination .",
    "the contribution to h lines from collisional excitation was neglected because the excitation potentials of h levels are much higher than the average thermal equilibrium temperature that characterizes h ii regions @xcite .",
    "in addition , equation  ( [ eq : ionabun ] ) assumes that nebular forbidden lines originate from collisionally excited levels .",
    "collisional excitation is significant in this case because the low - lying energy levels of the relevant ions are of the order of _",
    "however , according to @xcite , recombinations of o@xmath31 can excite the nebular doublet  @xmath32 , used to compute /.",
    "the effect of this process will be analyzed in the future .    although the presence of the nebular he ii 4686   emission - line in the spectra of several metal - poor systems implies the presence of unobserved o@xmath33/h@xmath11 , the contribution of this ion to the total oxygen abundance amounts to only a few percent according to our photoionization models .",
    "therefore , we obtained the oxygen abundance by assuming that o / h = ( o@xmath11 + o@xmath31 ) / .",
    "the n / o ratio was determined from n / o = icf @xmath34 n@xmath11/o@xmath11 , where the icf was derived using models as explained in   [ sec : conditions ] .",
    "a 5@xmath35 order fit to data from @xcite was adopted for @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath36 = @xmath37 , where @xmath38@xmath23 .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the fraction @xmath29 was determined using a 5-level atom routine written and tested thoroughly for accuracy by one of us ( a. n. ) .",
    "the equilibrium equations for each electronic level were solved using gauss - jordan elimination and the maximum pivot technique ( chapman 1998 ) .",
    "column ( 1 ) of table  [ atomicdata ] shows the list of ions involved in the determination of n / o . columns ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) of the same table give references for the energy levels , transition rates , and collisional strengths , respectively , employed in the 5-level atom calculations .",

    "unfortunately , in practice  and  can not be directly inferred from their corresponding ratios because the auroral line  @xmath12 and the auroral doublet  @xmath13 are usually absent in observational data .",
    "however , photoionization models can predict the auroral line strengths required for deriving theoretical relations of the form  =  @xmath50 [ ] and  =  @xmath51 [ ] .",
    "the independent variable of these relations is , since this temperature can be inferred directly from the observed @xmath46  ratio of low metallicity systems as long as  @xmath6 is detected with good s / n . note that the advantage of finding individual parameterizations for  and   is that this minimizes the uncertainty in  ( and n / o ) which is introduced by assuming that  and  are equivalent functions of , as discussed in   1 .    in order to find separate temperature parameterizations for  and ,",
    "determine the icf for obtaining n / o from / , and carefully estimate uncertainties in n / o , we computed a grid of photoionization models , representative of low metallicity systems . in the following paragraphs ,",
    "we introduce , the stellar atmosphere code used to generate the spectra that served as input to our  photoionization models , we explain the choice of parameter space covered by our stellar and nebular simulations , we describe how we proceeded to obtain the temperature parameterizations and icf from our models , and we derive the electron temperatures , electron densities , and ionic abundances of our sample objects .    is a general stellar atmosphere code which operates in one - dimensional spherically symmetric or plane - parallel geometry .",
    "it can handle static atmospheres ( e.g. stars , jupiter - like planets , brown dwarfs ) as well as moving atmospheres ( supernovae , novae , massive hot stars , etc . ) .",
    "the code simultaneously solves the equations of radiative transfer ( in the proper geometry ) , structure , and level population in non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) .",
    "we used s wind module package @xcite to generate synthetic spectra in the range from 100 to 8@xmath3410@xmath52  , for six windy o - dwarf stars with solar/5 , solar/20 , or solar/50 metal abundances , except for n and c , which we scaled in order to be consistent with typical proportions found in low metallicity systems , i.e. , log(n / o ) = -1.46 and log(c / o ) = -0.7 @xcite .",
    "the set of solar abundances was modified in order to match that of the code we used for our photoionization models .",
    "other input parameters to the models were based on those employed by @xcite , who generated  synthetic spectra for the same type of stars , with solar/5 and solar/20 proportions for all metals ( including n and c ) .",
    "we adopted a @xmath24-law for the wind velocity , i.e. , @xmath53 where r is the distance from the center of the star , @xmath54 is the radius of the `` photosphere '' ( considered to be the base of the wind ) , and @xmath55 is the terminal velocity , assumed to be reached at 100 @xmath34 @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath24-index was assumed to be 0.8 @xcite .",
    "the density structure in the dynamic region ( @xmath56 ) was calculated from the continuity equation : @xmath57 where , @xmath58 is the mass density and @xmath59 is the mass loss rate . in the hydrostatic region ( @xmath60 ) the density structure was calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "all models have 45 zones for the dynamic region and five zones for the hydrostatic region .",
    "a great deal of acceleration comes from resonance line radiation pressure of metals .",
    "therefore , as in @xcite , the dependences of @xmath61 and @xmath59 on the metallicity were parametrized by : @xmath62 and @xmath63 values for v@xmath64 and @xmath65 can be found in @xcite .",
    "a summary of the parameters characterizing our  models is given in table  [ stars ] .",
    "for each model listed in column ( 1 ) , columns ( 2 ) through ( 8) show the following information : ( 2 ) atmosphere s metallicity , ( 3 ) stellar mass loss rate , ( 4 ) wind s terminal velocity , ( 5 ) photospheric temperature , ( 6 ) surface gravity , ( 7 ) stellar radius , and ( 8) total luminosity in the range specified within parenthesis . in figure  [ fenix.vs.wmb ] , we display the ionizing portion of  ( solid lines ) and  ( dashed lines ) spectra for two solar/20 o - dwarfs .",
    "the effective temperatures of the stars are 43 kk ( top panel ) and 50 kk ( bottom panel ) .",
    "note that the  models differ from the  models in that the former have more hydrogen ionizing photons and fewer helium ionizing photons .",
    "this is due to the fact that  absorbs the he ionizing flux due to the presence of more lines .",
    "therefore , the normalized luminosity is re - distributed towards h ionizing energies .",
    "we used  to simulate the spectra of 24 single - star h ii regions .",
    "the phoenix star used as input to each model is listed in column ( 1 ) of table  [ clouds ] .",
    "note that we reduced the spectral resolution of the  energy distributions in order to fit s default resolution .",
    "this was done using the congrid routine implemented in idl version 5.5 .",
    "the following general characteristics are shared by all of our models : spherical geometry ( ionizing source fully covered ) , constant h density , homogeneous distribution of the gas ( filling factor of 1 ) , and static configuration .",
    "studying the effects of using more complex models falls beyond the scope of this paper .    all nebulae have he / h = 0.1 and metal abundances identical to those of the atmospheres of the illuminating stars , except for the refractory elements na , mg , al , si , ca and fe , which are depleted by a factor of 10 since they are likely to be found in the form of grains in h ii regions @xcite .",
    "accordingly , grains were included in our simulations by turning on the `` grains ism '' feature implemented in , with their abundances scaled down by a factor of 1/5 , 1/20 , or 1/50 , in order to be consistent with the oxygen depletion of the model .    in order to study the effect of varying the nebula s electron density , we ran models for two different values of , 10 or 100 , which are typical values measured in low metallicity systems .",
    "we also varied the distance from the star to the illuminated face of the cloud ( r@xmath66 ) , adopting either 2 pc , ( which is bigger than the radius of a planetary nebula ) or 5 pc ( which allowed us to cover a range for the ionization parameter comparable to what is found in the literature ) .",
    "the above choices resulted in -3.17 @xmath9 log(u ) @xmath9 -0.42 .",
    "the parameters characterizing our  models are summarized in table  [ clouds ] , which gives o / h in column ( 2 ) , the h density in column ( 3 ) , r@xmath66 in column ( 4 ) , log(u ) in column ( 5 ) and the nebular geometry in column ( 6 ) .",
    "note that the latter is plane - parallel if @xmath67 , a thick shell if @xmath68 , and spherical if @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the thickness of the cloud set by the stopping temperature , chosen to be 100 k.    in order to find parameterizations of  and  with respect to , from models , , , and  need to be determined independent of each other first .",
    "this can be accomplished using two different methods .",
    "the first method , corresponding to common practice @xcite , is to compute each temperature from : @xmath71 i.e. , each temperature is an ion and  weighted volume  mean .",
    "however , the above three temperatures can also be obtained from their respective line flux ratios , @xmath46[n ii ] , @xmath46[o ii ] , or @xmath46[o iii ] , as explained below .",
    "this second method has the advantage of being consistent with the observational way of obtaining , i.e. , from line flux ratios .",
    "ideally , temperature parameterizations should be independent of the method employed to compute the individual temperatures .",
    "we will compare temperatures computed with different methods further on , but first , we will explain how we determined , , and  from their respective line flux ratios .    in order to accomplish the latter",
    ", we used an iterative procedure based on brent s method for finding roots @xcite .",
    "for each of the 24 photoionization models , the idea is to use our 5-level atom routine to compute repeatedly the theoretical line flux ratio , @xmath72 , for assumed values of  over a range of 4 - 25  kk until it matches the model - predicted value @xmath73 to within a tolerance of 0.001 .",
    "we carried out this procedure separately for the two density regimes of 10 and 100  @xmath25 . using a maximum of 100 iterations to solve the equation numerically , we searched for the value of  which satisfied the relation : @xmath74~-~r_{mod } } { r_{the}[t_e , n_e ] } ~=~0.001.\\label{eq : zbrent}\\ ] ]",
    "henceforth , we will refer to models with  = 10  and  = 100  as the n10 and n100 models , respectively .",
    "our temperature parameterizations for the n10 models are @xmath75 and @xmath76 while for the n100 models they are @xmath77 and @xmath78    for each model , figure  [ meante - ratiote ] shows two independent values of  on left panel , and two independent values of  on the right panel . on the left panel ,",
    "the value obtained using @xmath46[o iii ] is given vertically , while the value @xmath79 predicted by equation ( [ eq : meante ] ) is given horizontally .",
    "the agreement between the two  temperatures is excellent . on the right panel , the parameterized  given by either equation ( [ eq : to210 ] ) or ( [ eq : to2100 ] ) [ depending on the input value of n(h ) ]",
    "is given vertically , with open circles representing n10 models and filled circles representing n100 models .",
    "on the same panel , the horizontal value is that predicted by equation ( [ eq : meante ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the two  temperatures is reasonable , with the parameterized value being higher than @xmath80 for most models .",
    "the biggest difference found is  - @xmath80 of about 800 k. the effect of this difference on the  ratios is discussed below . since unfortunately",

    "the following can be noticed when analyzing figure  [ teplot ] . for a given ion (  or ) ,  ( vertical axis ) at a given  is in general higher for the n100 models than for the n10 models .",
    "this is due to the fact that as  increases , u decreases , bringing the regions where  and  are emitting closer to the ionizing source , making them hotter .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in figure  [ tevsne ] , which has three panels .",
    "the top panel shows  as a function of depth from the illuminated face of the cloud for two models with @xmath83 = 43 kk , @xmath84 = 2 pc , and o / h = solar/50 , only differing in their value of .",

    "the dotted lines clearly show that  at the peak of /n is higher by roughly 1000  k for the n100 model .",
    "the same is true for  at the peak of /o .",

    "this is shown more clearly in figure  [ to2vstn2 ] , which features  vs.  for all models , and is a result of the fact that the regions where  and  emit do not completely overlap , the  region extending more towards the star into hotter gas , as we pointed out earlier in our discussion of figure  [ tevsne ] . our models also indicate that this offset becomes larger with rising stellar temperature and falling metallicity .    in order to show that it is better to use  independent of  when determining the  ratios of low metallicity systems , we derived the  ratios of our sample objects using three different methods but always adopting  = 100 .",
    "methods 1 and 2 both assume that  = , the assumption frequently made by researchers in the past . in method  1 ,",
    "both temperatures are computed using equation ( [ eq : tn2100 ] ) , while in method  2 equation ( [ eq : to2100 ] ) is used instead . then values of / , / , and ultimately are determined from these derived temperatures .",
    "finally , method 3 uses equations ( [ eq : tn2100 ] ) and ( [ eq : to2100 ] ) to compute / , / , respectively .",
    "the resulting three sets of  ratios are shown in figure  [ tn2andorto2 ] .",
    "the top panel is a plot of method 1 versus method 3 , while the bottom panel is a plot of method 2 versus method 3 .",
    "we see that using either method 1 or 2 results in systematically underestimating the  ratios by roughly .05-.10  dex",

    "this new value of  was then employed in the derivation of the n and o abundances of the above 42 objects .",
    "for the remaining objects , we used the average  found for this subsample , i.e. , @xmath8200 .",
    "our final values for , , , and  are listed for each object in our sample in columns ( 2 ) through ( 5 ) in table  [ ionabun ] .    finally , we used our models to derive an icf for obtaining n / o from .",
    "this was accomplished by computing the average of ( n / o)/ ( ) for the n100 models , where relevant line fluxes and parameterizations were employed to obtain each  ratio , while n / o was fixed and given by the input value to our models , i.e. , log(n / o ) = -1.46 .",
    "the average icf for these models is 1.08 with a standard deviation of 0.09 .",
    "this contrasts with common practice which is to use icf = 1 .    unfortunately , the icf depends on the method employed to compute .",
    "a common practice is to compute  from the ion fractions @xmath89 and @xmath90 given by : @xmath91 and the input values of n and o. a comparison between the  ratios that we used to compute our final icf , and those given by equation ( [ eq : meanifrac ] ) , is shown in figure  [ icf ] . in this figure ,",
    "the difference between log ( ) and log(@xmath92 ) is plotted against log(@xmath92 ) .",
    "the latter value is that predicted by equation ( [ eq : meanifrac ] ) , while log ( ) is the value obtained from relevant line flux ratios and the temperature parameterizations for the n100 models .",
    "note that figure  [ icf ] illustrates the need of an icf for obtaining n / o at low metallicities , no matter which method is used to compute it .",
    "clearly , log(@xmath92 ) deviates from log(n / o ) which as mentioned above is fixed at -1.46 for all models .",
    "in fact , the use of @xmath92 when computing the icf results in an average of 1.28 with a standard deviation of 0.1 .    the vertical difference in figure  [ icf ]",
    "is at most @xmath80.11 dex .",
    "it is positive because  values from line flux ratios and parameterized temperatures are higher than those predicted by equation ( [ eq : meanifrac ] ) .",
    "this fact is reflected in the smaller icf obtained when using line flux ratio  values .",
    "since our method is consistent with the way in which  is measured observationally , i.e. , from line flux ratios , we applied an icf of 1.08 when deriving the n / o abundances of our sample objects .",
    "the icf s contribution to the final n / o uncertainties was accordingly taken to be @xmath20.09 .",
    "we used the above results for density , temperatures , and icf determinations to derive new values for the o / h and n / o ratios for our sample objects .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties were obtained using standard error propagation , where the quantities considered in our estimation of the abundance errors is given in table  [ error ] .",
    "the quantities listed in column ( 1 ) were assumed to be functions of the variables given in column ( 2 ) .",
    "note that because  depends on  and visa versa , and since in addition ,  had to be assumed for a significant number of objects ( see below ) ,  does not appear in table  [ error ] .",
    "for each object in our sample , table  [ ionabun ] gives the object name in column ( 1 ) ,  in column ( 2 ) , , , and  in columns ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) , respectively , and o@xmath11/h@xmath11 , o@xmath31/h@xmath11 , and n@xmath93/h@xmath11 in columns ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8) , respectively .",
    "our final abundance results are given in table  [ bigtable ] , which lists object name in column ( 1 ) , references for the observed emission - line strengths in column ( 2 ) , our derived values for  @xmath94 and log(n / o ) @xmath94 in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and literature values and references in columns ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "figures  [ oldnew_o2h ] and  [ oldnew_n2o ] feature comparisons of our o / h and n / o values ( vertical axes ) against published values .",
    "the diagonals show points of one - to - one correspondence .",
    "our o / h values are systematically lower with respect to past calculations due primarily to our new temperature scheme for calculating o@xmath11/h@xmath11 .",
    "however , in general , the error bars show agreement between our results and literature values .",
    "our n / o values are also offset ( higher by @xmath8 0.05 to 0.1 dex ) due the use of new temperature parametrizations and an icf for obtaining n / o .    in figure  [ oldnew_sigma_n2o ]",
    ", we plot our uncertainties in log(n / o ) against corresponding literature values .",
    "some of the published uncertainties were estimated using monte carlo simulations to propagate the errors in the relevant line strengths @xcite , and thus points occupy both sides of the diagonal due to the random nature of the latter technique .",
    "we point out that log(n / o ) values with small uncertainties generally correspond to objects with small uncertainties in relevant emission - line strengths .",
    "the tendency for our error estimates to systematically exceed published ones is primarily due to the contribution of icf uncertainty for each of our objects .",
    "however , we strongly argue that inclusion of this additional factor produces more realistic uncertainties than those previously published .",
    "figure  [ oursample ] is a plot of n / o versus o / h for the abundances and uncertainties listed in table  [ bigtable ] .",
    "recall that n / o is a ratio which measures differential nucleosynthesis , while o / h is a metallicity gauge and measures the extent of chemical evolution in the area immediately surrounding the observed emission - line region .",
    "furthermore , each data point in figure  [ oursample ] provides a snapshot of current conditions within a galaxy , each of which arrived at its present position by following a path determined by its own unique star formation history .",
    "figure  [ n2ohisto ] shows the distribution of n / o values for our sample , using a bin size of 0.02  dex .",
    "two distinct groups of objects are apparent .",
    "the larger population comprises objects extending over the entire o / h range considered here and possessing n / o values which appear to be distributed in near - gaussian fashion between limits of -1.54 @xmath0 n / o @xmath0 - 1.27 .",
    "these limits are indicated with dashed lines in figures  [ oursample ] and [ n2ohisto ] .",
    "the remaining objects with n / o",
    "@xmath10 -1.27 appear to belong to a smaller population which is concentrated at the high end of our o / h range and possess relatively high n / o values compared with the larger group .",
    "the 52 objects making up the larger population form what we will define for purposes of analysis as the _ n / o plateau_. the n / o plateau has been discussed by numerous authors , including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we argue that by treating this group of objects separately , we are not doing so in an arbitrarily fashion .",
    "rather we are led to this result for the following reasons .",
    "first , the distribution of the entire sample in the n / o dimension shown in figure  [ n2ohisto ] strongly hints at the existence of two distinct groups of objects .",
    "second , our current theoretical understanding of n production strongly suggests that we should expect a narrow , horizontal track at low metallcities where the production is primary .",
    "both analytical and numerical models such as those presented in @xcite predict the presence of this track .",
    "finally , a theoretical analysis of the n / o plateau shape by henry , nava , & prochaska ( 2006 ) using numerical chemical evolution models finds that an additional n production process triggered at o / h@xmath107.8 is needed to explain the high n / o objects .",
    "thus , we conclude that current observational and theoretical evidence suggests that what we have defined as the n / o plateau consists of objects which have been subjected to similar n production mechanisms , and that we are justified in excluding , for the time being , those objects in the smaller group which possess higher n / o ratios .",
    "we now discuss some of the statistical aspects of our measurements . in doing",
    "so we note that all means , errors , and standard deviations relating to our sample and given below were initially computed in linear space and then converted to their corresponding logarithmic quantities .",
    "this is not necessarily true for values quoted from other papers , however .",
    "the log of the weighted mean of n / o for the 52 objects lying on the plateau is -1.43 ( + .0084/-.0085 ) , where the values in parenthesis represent the error in the mean , not the standard deviation , and were derived from observational uncertainties quoted in column ( 4 ) of table  [ bigtable ] .",
    "the value for plateau objects with o / h below 7.8 is -1.44 ( + .011/-.012 ) , while above 7.8 it is measured to be -1.41 ( + .012/-.013 ) , so there is no evidence of metallicity dependence of the mean .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those of @xcite , who obtained -1.47 ( @xmath95.14 ) for their total sample , -1.60 ( @xmath95.02 ) for their low metallicity ( o / h @xmath96 7.6 ) objects , and -1.46 ( @xmath2.14 ) for their high metallicity ( o / h @xmath10 7.6 ) objects .",
    "likewise , our results are in close agreement with @xcite , who found log(n / o ) = -1.46 ( + .10/-.13 ) for plateau objects . finally , the standard deviation about the weighted mean for our plateau objects , expressed logarithmically , is + .071/-.084 , nearly an order of magnitude larger than the error in the mean .",
    "an interesting question pertaining to the distribution of points in the n / o - o / h plane concerns the nature of the observed n / o scatter ( as measured by the standard deviation ) of the plateau objects and to what degree it is related to errors in abundance measurements .",
    "that is to say , is the spread in n / o associated with the plateau due mostly to intrinsic or statistical scatter ? to investigate this point further , we assumed a gaussian distribution in the parent n / o plateau population , as suggested by the distribution shape in figure  [ n2ohisto ] , and performed a @xmath4-square analysis of the observed point distribution of log(n / o ) for the plateau using our calculated weighted mean value for log(n / o ) of -1.43 along with the established errors in the abundances , as given in column ( 4 ) of table  [ bigtable ] .",
    "we found that the value for the reduced @xmath4-square - square , @xmath97 ^ 2\\right\\}$ ] , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the n / o value and uncertainty of the",
    "_ i_th object , @xmath100 is the sample average , and n is the number of sample objects . within the summation , the denominator represents the measurement errors . ] for the 52 plateau objects is 1.244 , consistent with a probability of about 90% that our sample of objects could not have been drawn randomly from a parent population characterized by our calculated mean log(n / o ) , error , and standard deviation .",
    "in other words , some additional scatter is needed to explain the observed spread in n / o - square value , we calculated each object s contribution to the total @xmath4-square and found no points to be excessively high . ] .",
    "in order to estimate the magnitude of this additional scatter , we recalculated reduced @xmath4-square values for the 52 plateau objects numerous times , each time adding intrinsic scatter to the measurement errors in quadrature to simulate real scatter among the objects , with a target value for the reduced @xmath4-square of unity .",
    "such a value was reached when @xmath101 for the intrinsic component was 0.024 , or about 1/3 of the magnitude of the standard deviation and the typical statistical uncertainties in column ( 4 ) of table  [ bigtable ] .",
    "therefore , the implication of this @xmath4-square analysis is that only a small portion of the scatter observed for the plateau objects is intrinsic .",
    "considering that the many of the uncertainties associated with the line strengths taken from the literature for our analysis are only estimated and not determined in a rigorous fashion , we can not conclude with any confidence that a significant portion of the vertical scatter in n / o is real .",
    "rather , the issue can only be decided by using better measurements including well - determined uncertainties in the abundances .",
    "this paper has been devoted to a detailed review of the method for deriving n and o abundances in low mass emission - line galaxies with 12 + log(o / h)@xmath9 8.1 .",
    "these low metallicity systems are classified in the literature as dwarf irregular galaxies , blue compact galaxies , or h ii galaxies .",
    "the principal motivation for our work was to estimate the contribution of the n / o uncertainties to the scatter among n / o plateau objects in the log(n / o ) versus  diagram . to carry out this study ,",
    "we selected a sample of 68 objects from the literature and used their published de - reddened emission - line strengths to calculate a homogeneous set of abundances , paying special attention to the determination of [ n  ii ] and [ o  ii ] electron temperatures for which the necessary but weak auroral lines are usually absent from the data . in such cases these temperatures , which are needed to compute the abundances of their associated ions ( n@xmath11 and o@xmath11 ) ,",
    "must be inferred from parametric relations in terms of the more accessible [ o iii ] temperature .",
    "we established theoretical relations for the relevant temperatures based on single - star h ii region simulations ( modeled with ) and employing our own input stellar spectra ( modeled with ) .",
    "these relations were derived from line flux ratio temperatures in contrast with common practice , which is to use ion and -weighted volume temperature means .",
    "we also used our models to infer an icf for obtaining n / o from , and to carefully estimate n / o uncertainites by applying standard error propagation methods .",
    "this icf was derived from line flux ratio ionic abundances , also in contrast with common practice , which is to use -weighted volume ion fraction means .",
    "our method has the advantage of being consistent with the procedure employed to derive  and  from observations , i.e. , from line flux ratios .",
    "note that  values from line flux ratios and parameterized temperatures are higher than those predicted by equation ( [ eq : meanifrac ] ) .",
    "however , this fact is taken care of by our value for the icf .      1 .   and  diverge significantly from each other in low metallicity regimes .",
    "therefore , the assumption of previous authors that these two temperatures are equivalent appears to be invalid at low metallicities .",
    "2 .   a realistic value for the /  ionization correction factor is 1.08@xmath2.09 .",
    "our final n / o values are systematically larger than previous results , while we find that o / h is generally below other measurements .",
    "this outcome is due to our new temperatures and icf determinations .",
    "the majority ( 52 ) of objects in our survey form a relatively flat , horizontal system in the n / o - o / h plane , consistent with the idea that both n and o production are primary at low metallicity .",
    "these galaxies comprise what we define as the n / o plateau .",
    "plateau objects appear to form a gaussian distribution in log(n / o ) between -1.54 and -1.27 with the logarithm of the weighted arithmetic average , log(n / o ) , being -1.43 ( + .0084/-.0085 ) and a standard deviation of + .071/-.084 .",
    "a @xmath102 analysis of the plateau objects indicates that only a small fraction of the observed scatter in n / o is intrinsic , although this conclusion remains tentative until line strength uncertainties , which are the largest contributors to the abundance uncertainties , can be rigorously determined for a large sample of objects .",
    "the remaining 16 sample objects have",
    "log(n / o ) values exceeding -1.27 and therefore reside above the n / o plateau as we define it here .",
    "+ abundances of n and o are expected to improve in accuracy and precision as better temperature determinations become possible through the use of large telescopes capable of obtaining high s / n spectral observations of the auroral lines of  and . until that time",
    ", photoionization models of increased sophistication can go a long way toward reducing the uncertainty , as we have shown here .",
