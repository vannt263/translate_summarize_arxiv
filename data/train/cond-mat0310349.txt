    "the andreev reflection is the process of elastic transfer of two electrons forming a cooper pair from the superconductor to the normal metal @xcite .",
    "electrons that are emitted in the normal metal cross the normal / superconductor interface within a distance of the order of the size of the cooper pair .",
    "it is thus possible for the two electrons to be transmitted in two different normal leads , when the distance between the contacts is comparable with the pairs size .",
    "this process , called crossed andreev reflection ( car ) , can be used to probe directly the spatial structure of the cooper pair , but how can it be detected ?",
    "different authors have proposed to measure the conductance matrix in the multiterminal structure and to extract the distance dependent contribution of the car @xcite .",
    "however this procedure has two main drawbacks .",
    "first , car comes along with elastic cotunneling ( ec)@xcite , the transfer of an electron from one normal lead to the other one through the superconductor ( conserving its spin and energy ) .",
    "second , car and ec contributions to the average currents are dominated by direct andreev reflection in each normal lead , _",
    "i.e. _ , by the current associated with the transfer of two electrons in the same lead @xcite .",
    "we will show that one can pick up the car or the ec contribution directly by measuring the cross - correlation of currents in the two normal leads .    as a matter of fact , due to the discrete nature of charges , current fluctuates in time around its mean value .",
    "current noise measurement revealed a powerful probe for electronic systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , cross - correlation in multiterminal superconducting hybrid structures has deserved some attention since it was first anticipated @xcite and then predicted @xcite to show a sign change with respect to normal metallic structures .",
    "a simplified explanation of this effect is the following .",
    "if electrons in the two leads are emitted from one cooper pair , one expects a positive correlation , since both electrons appear at the same time in each lead .",
    "by contrast , electrons from a fermionic source due to pauli principle arrive one by one in each channel and they are transmitted either in one or the other lead , leading to a negative correlation .",
    "most calculations consider y - shaped structures attached to a superconducting lead through a single junction @xcite .",
    "this geometry is the standard one for interference in optical experiments , but it leads to a variety of elementary processes for charge transfer in electronic samples .",
    "this makes the interpretation of the cross - correlation s sign more subtle @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the different situation ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ layout ] ) where _ each _ normal arm is _ directly _ connected to the superconductor through a tunnel interface .",
    "we find that car contributes to the cross - correlation with a positive sign , while ec contributes with a negative sign , and there are no spurious contributions from direct andreev reflection .",
    "the car and ec contributions can be selected independently by tuning the voltages of the normal terminals .",
    "cross - correlation in tunneling systems thus provides a direct way ( _ i _ ) to probe both car and ec and ( _ ii _ ) to measure the sign change of the correlations .",
    "we present quantitative predictions for the dependence of the cross - correlation spectral noise on the distance between normal arms both in the ballistic and diffusive regimes .",
    "let us consider a conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer superconductor weakly connected to two normal metal leads called a and b ( see fig . [ layout ] ) .        to describe charge transport we use the standard tunnel hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 describe the clean or impurity - disordered normal lead @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) and the superconductor , respectively . explicitly @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] with @xmath7 the superconducting gap .",
    "the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the destruction operators for electrons of spin @xmath10 in the normal metal @xmath3 and in the superconductor , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 together with the spin indicate quantum numbers labelling the eigenstates in the disconnected leads . the tunneling part of the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath13 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the quantum amplitude for an electron to tunnel from position @xmath16 in the normal lead @xmath3 , to position @xmath17 in the superconductor .",
    "we introduce the electrostatic potential by the standard gauge transformation @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the subgap regime defined by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "then , no excitation can be created in the superconductor over times larger than @xmath22 . under these conditions , in lowest order of perturbation theory , only two different processes contribute to charge transport : andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling . in both cases",
    "the corresponding quantum amplitude can be obtained using second order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the andreev process , one can calculate the quantum amplitude for destroying a cooper pair in the superconductor and create two electrons , one in the lead @xmath3 with spin @xmath23 and the other in lead @xmath24 with spin @xmath25 .",
    "the result is : @xmath26 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the superconducting spectrum .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to the injection of both electrons in the same lead , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 give the amplitude of the crossed andreev reflection . in a similar way one can calculate the amplitude for elastic cotunneling @xmath33 : @xmath34 \\,.\\ ] ]",

    "this new hamiltonian is equivalent to the initial one at low energies and it allows to obtain current and noise straightforwardly .",
    "current operator in each normal lead is defined , as usual , by the time derivative of the particle number operator @xmath38 : @xmath39 $ ] ( sign conventions are defined in fig . [ layout ] ) .",

    "as mentioned above the average current has three components : the direct andreev ( @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) , the crossed andreev ( @xmath54 ) , and the elastic cotunneling ( @xmath55 ) currents .",
    "the direct andreev term is instead absent in the cross - correlation given by eq .",
    "( [ meansab ] ) : cross - correlation is thus a direct measure of car and ec . it is convenient to introduce @xmath56 and @xmath57 in terms of which we have : @xmath58 .",

    "( [ sab ] ) and ( [ finalcurrent ] )",
    "the advantage of measuring the low - temperature cross correlation over the mean current is apparent .",
    "indeed , in @xmath61 for @xmath99 there is no direct term .",
    "this allows to measure directly @xmath92 or @xmath93 by setting @xmath100 or @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the same procedure would not work by measuring the current . as we will see below , @xmath102 ,",
    "thus the current becomes @xmath103 , with no residual dependence on @xmath104 .",
    "the interesting @xmath43 dependence is thus hidden by the direct term @xmath105 . in order to raise the amplitude degeneracy some authors @xcite proposed to perform the experiment with spin - polarized normal leads , and",
