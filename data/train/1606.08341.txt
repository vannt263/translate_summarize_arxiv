    "we set some notations that are common in the study of saw : the number of @xmath6-step saws @xmath11 and the connective constant @xmath12 ( due to the subbadditivity of saw , the existence of this limit is guaranteed ) . note that @xmath13 and @xmath14 on @xmath3 .",
    "given the energy cost @xmath15 and the strength of randomness @xmath16 , we define the quenched susceptibility at @xmath7 by @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath19 is monotonic in @xmath20 , we can define the quenched critical point by @xmath21 in @xcite , we prove on @xmath22 that @xmath23 is independent of the reference point @xmath24 and it is a degenerate random variable",
    ". moreover , it is valid for the case that @xmath25 is a collection of integrable random variables whose law @xmath10 is translation - invariant and ergodic . henceforth , we simply write the quenched critical point by @xmath26 .    in the study of the disordered systems , it is standard to investigate the annealed model .",
