    "study of fermion triangle diagrams with one axial and two vector currents represents a remarkable story .",
    "the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly in the divergence of axial current , the adler - bardeen nonrenormalization theorem , the wess - zumino effective action , calculation of the @xmath1 amplitude , the t hooft consistency condition , and the solution of the u(1 ) problem give an incomplete list of acts where these triangles played a major role .    the famous adler - bardeen theorem @xcite proves nonrenormalization for the longitudinal part of triangles associated with the divergence of the axial current .",
    "there is no general statement about the transversal part of the triangle .",
    "this part , even its existence , depends on the choice of external momenta . in this note",
    "we argue that in special kinematics when one of the vector currents carries a soft momentum the transversal part is unambiguously fixed by the longitudinal one in the chiral limit of perturbation theory .",
    "such relation immediately proves an absence of perturbative corrections to the transversal part of fermion triangles in the kinematics considered .",
    "a particular physical situation where the triangle diagrams enter in special kinematics with one soft momentum occurs for the two - loop electroweak corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment . in ref.@xcite",
    " the study which stimulated the present work  the nonrenormalization theorem for the transversal part is used to show an absence of gluon corrections to light quark loops .",
    "the difference between longitudinal and transversal parts shows up at a nonperturbative level .",
    "the operator product expansion ( ope ) demonstrates this explicitly : in the chiral limit only the transversal part in the ope contains nonleading operators @xcite .",
    "nonrenormalization of the longitudinal part , both perturbatively and nonperturbatively , constitutes the t  hooft consistency condition @xcite , i.e.  the exact quark - hadron duality . in qcd",
    "this duality is realized as a correspondence between the infrared singularity of the quark triangle and the massless pion pole in terms of hadrons .",
    "it is clear that for the transversal part this kind of duality can not be exact in qcd : there is no massless particle contributing to the transversal part .",
    "thus , the transversal part of the triangle with a soft momentum in one of the vector currents provides us with an interesting object : no perturbative corrections but nonperturbatively it is modified .",
    "an example of a nonperturbative quantity related to fermion triangles is the quark condensate magnetic susceptibility .",
    "it was introduced in ref.@xcite via the matrix element of @xmath2 between the vacuum and soft photon states . using the ope analysis of the triangle amplitude carried on in ref.@xcite together with an additional assumption about the pion dominance in the longitudinal part we will derive a new relation for the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this relation , similar to the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation between the pion and quark masses , is in agreement with the qcd sum rule fit @xcite .",
    "we follow ref.@xcite in notations and definitions .",
    "let us start with a definition of vector , @xmath3 , and axial , @xmath4 , currents , @xmath5 where the quark field @xmath6 has color ( @xmath7 ) and flavor ( @xmath8 ) indices and the matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 are diagonal matrices of vector and axial couplings acting on flavor indexes . to avoid dealing with the u(1 ) anomaly in respect to gluon interactions we assume that tr@xmath11 . in the case of electroweak corrections one can view the vector current as an electromagnetic one with @xmath9 being the matrix of electric charges and @xmath4 as the axial part of the @xmath12 boson current with matrix @xmath10 given by the weak isospin projection .",
    "the amplitude for the triangle diagram in fig.[fig : triangle ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     involving the axial current @xmath4 and two vector currents @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( for generality we use a different matrix @xmath15 for the soft momentum current ) can be written as @xmath16 we can view the current @xmath17 as a source of a soft photon with the momentum @xmath18 . introducing a polarization vector of a soft photon @xmath19 we come to the amplitude @xmath20 @xmath21 which can be viewed as a mixing between the axial and vector currents in the external electromagnetic field .",
    "it is clear that the expansion of @xmath22 in the small momentum @xmath23 starts with linear terms and we neglect quadratic and higher powers of @xmath23 .",
    "there are only two lorentz structures for @xmath22 which are linear in @xmath23 and consistent with the conservation of electromagnetic current , @xmath24,\\\\[1 mm ] & & \\tilde f_{\\mu \\nu } = \\frac{1}{2}\\ , \\epsilon _ { \\mu \\nu   \\gamma \\delta }   f^{\\gamma \\delta } \\,,\\qquad   f_{\\mu \\nu } = k_\\mu e_\\nu -k_\\nu e_\\mu \\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both structures are transversal with respect to vector current , @xmath25 . as for the axial current ,",
    "the first structure is transversal with respect to @xmath26 while the second is longitudinal .",
    "the one - loop result for the invariant functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be taken from the classic papers by bell and jackiw  @xcite , adler  @xcite and rosenberg  @xcite ( it simplifies considerably in the limit of the small photon momentum @xcite ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , the factor @xmath31 accounts for the color of quarks and @xmath32 is the diagonal quark mass matrix , @xmath33 . in the chiral limit , @xmath34 , the invariant functions @xmath35 are @xmath36=2\\,w^{\\rm 1-loop}_t[m=0 ] = \\frac{2n_c\\,{\\rm tr } \\,(a\\,v\\,\\widetilde v)}{q^2}\\,.\\ ] ] nonvanishing in the chiral limit , @xmath37 , the longitudinal part @xmath38 represents the axial anomaly @xcite , @xmath39 and its nonrenormalization implies that the one - loop result ( [ msquare ] ) for @xmath28 stays intact when interaction with gluons is switched on .",
    "we claim that the relation @xmath40=2\\,w_t[m=0 ] \\label{wtwl}\\ ] ] which holds at the one - loop level , see eq.([msquare ] ) , gets no perturbative corrections from gluon exchanges .",
    "this follows from the following line of argumentation .    in the chosen kinematics the fermion triangle with @xmath34 possesses a special feature : namely , a symmetry under permutation of indexes of axial and vector currents , @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , in the triangle diagrams @xmath42 and @xmath43 in fig.[fig : triangle ] one can move @xmath44 from the axial vertex @xmath45 to the vector vertex @xmath46 . in the chiral limit it moves via even number of gamma matrices in any order of perturbation theory . together with the change of the momentum @xmath47 ( which does not affect @xmath48 ) it shows the symmetry of the amplitude @xmath49 .    at first glance the symmetry under the @xmath50 permutation seems to be in contradiction with the general decomposition ( [ invfun ] ) : the transversal part of @xmath48 is antisymmetric , the longitudinal part has no symmetry , and there is no way to choose @xmath51 and @xmath28 which makes the @xmath48 symmetric .",
    "note , however , that the term @xmath52 in the transversal structure in eq.([invfun ] ) actually produces a term in @xmath48 which does not depend on @xmath53 .",
    "it is because @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath50 symmetry holds for a singular in @xmath53 part of @xmath48 when the condition ( [ wtwl ] ) relating @xmath51 to @xmath28 is fulfilled . the constant in @xmath53",
    "part is then fixed by the conservation of the vector current , @xmath55 .",
    "an independence on @xmath53 for the antisymmetric part provides , in fact , an alternative proof of the adler - bardeen theorem .",
    "indeed , gluon corrections would lead to logarithmic dependence on @xmath53 instead of the constant .",
    "another way to be automatically consistent with the vector current conservation is to use the pauli - vilars regulators .",
    "technically it reduces to subtraction from the triangles with massless quarks similar triangles with the heavy regulator fermions propagating on the loops .",
    "the regulator triangles produce terms which are polynomial in momenta , in our case terms linear in @xmath23 and independent on @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , it is simple to see that these terms are antisymmetric under the @xmath50 permutation .",
    "indeed , in the propagator of the heavy regulator the leading term contains no gamma - matrix that leads to the sign change when @xmath44 from the axial vertex @xmath57 is moved to the vector vertex @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we see that the crossing symmetry of the singular part in the triangle amplitude @xmath48 leads to the relation ( [ wtwl ] ) in perturbation theory .",
    "nonrenormalization of @xmath28 implies the same for @xmath58 .      to study a nonperturbative effect in the triangle amplitude @xmath48 one can use the ope methods .",
    "this section is a brief review of the ope analysis made in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis shows a nonpertubative difference between the longitudinal and transversal parts , we will use the results in the next section .",
    "the ope for the t - product of electromagnetic and axial currents at large euclidean @xmath59 has the form @xmath60 where the local operators @xmath61 are constructed from the light fields and supplied by a normalization point @xmath62 separating short distances ( accounted in the coefficients @xmath63 ) and large distances ( in matrix elements of @xmath64 ) .",
    "the field can be viewed as light if its mass is less than @xmath62 . in the problem under consideration besides quark and gluon fields this includes also the soft electromagnetic field @xmath65 . the field @xmath66 could enter local operators in a form of the gauge invariant field strength @xmath67 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath22 is given by the matrix element of the operator @xmath68 between the photon and vacuum states , @xmath69 in our approximation , when the matrix elements are linear in @xmath70 , they are nonvanishing only for operators with a pair of antisymmetric indexes , @xmath71 where constants @xmath72 depend on the normalization point @xmath73 . with only contributing operators",
    "the ope takes the form @xmath74 and the invariant functions @xmath35 can be presented as @xmath75    the leading ( by a minimal dimension ) is the @xmath76 operator @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the dual of the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "the numerical factor in ( [ opf ] ) is such that @xmath79 .",
    "the ope coefficients for @xmath80 follow from one - loop expressions ( [ wlt ] ) for @xmath81 , @xmath82=2c^f_{t}[\\mbox{1-loop}]= \\frac{2\\,n_c}{q^2}\\,{\\rm tr}\\,a\\,v\\widetilde v\\!\\left[1%-\\frac{2\\,m^2}{q^2}\\ln\\frac{q^2}{\\mu^2 } + { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{m^2}{q^2}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where we imply that @xmath83 , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the next , by dimension , are @xmath84 operators @xmath85 where the index denotes the quark flavor .",
    "the ope coefficients follow from tree diagrams of the compton scattering type , @xmath86 proportionality to @xmath87 is in correspondence with chirality arguments .",
    "taking matrix element of @xmath88 between the soft photon and vacuum states we produce the following terms in the invariant functions @xmath89 : @xmath90    in perturbation theory the matrix element @xmath91 of the chirality - flip operator @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "nonperturbatively , however , @xmath91 does not vanish at @xmath93 .",
    "due to spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry in qcd the matrix elements of quark operators ( [ fop ] ) are instead proportional to the quark condensate @xmath94 .",
    "it leads to the representation of @xmath91 in the form @xmath95 this representation was introduced by ioffe and smilga @xcite in their analysis of nucleon magnetic moments and @xmath96 radiative transitions with qcd sum rules . from a sum rule",
    "fit they determined the value of the parameter @xmath97 dubbed as the quark condensate magnetic susceptibility , @xmath98    we will consider an analytical calculation and comparison with other approaches for the susceptibility @xmath97 in the next section . here",
    "we notice that the effect of @xmath84 operators @xmath99 vanishes in the chiral limit , although as the first rather than second power of @xmath100 .",
    "what we are looking for , first of all , are terms in the ope which differentiate longitudinal and transversal parts in this limit .",
    "vanishing at the chiral limit persists also for the @xmath101 and @xmath102 operators .",
    "all operators of dimension 4 are reducible to the @xmath84 operators due to the following relation , @xmath103 the @xmath102 operators of the type @xmath104 and @xmath105 enter ope with factors @xmath87 as in the @xmath84 case .",
    "the distinction between longitudinal and transversal parts shows up at the @xmath106 level of four - fermion operators as it was firstly demonstrated in ref.@xcite . referring to ref.@xcite for more detailed discussion note here that these four - fermion operators change the transversal , but not longitudinal , part .",
    "arising due to these operators terms @xmath107 in @xmath51 reflect nonvanishing masses of meson resonances contributing to the transversal part .",
    "this was used in @xcite for construction of a resonance model for @xmath58 consistent with the ope constraints .",
    "in this section we limit ourselves by the axial current of the light @xmath108 and @xmath109 quarks , @xmath110 , i.e.  @xmath111 .",
    "a specific feature of the longitudinal part of @xmath48 in the chiral limit is that it is given by the leading @xmath76 operator @xmath112 in the whole range of @xmath113 , from the ultraviolet to infrared , @xmath114=\\frac{2n_c\\,{\\rm tr } \\,(a\\,v\\,\\widetilde v)}{q^2}\\,.\\ ] ] at large @xmath113 it is fixed by the ope , the pole singularity at small @xmath113 is due to massless pion with the residue that matches the ope .",
    "how is @xmath28 changed at nonvanishing but small @xmath115 ?",
    "a nonvanishing @xmath87 implies a nonvanishing pion mass so the pole in @xmath28 should be shifted from zero , @xmath116=\\frac{2n_c\\,{\\rm tr } \\,(a\\,v\\,\\widetilde v)}{q^2 + m_\\pi^2}\\,.\\ ] ] this expression extends the pion pole dominance , which is exact at @xmath117 , to the case of small but nonvanishing @xmath115 .",
    "such extension is certainly valid for @xmath113 which is much smaller than the characteristic hadronic scale , say the @xmath118 meson mass @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , at large @xmath113 the leading @xmath120 term in eq.([wlmne0 ] ) matches what follows from the ope .",
    "it is not enough , strictly speaking , to justify the pion dominance for the next , @xmath121 , term in expansion at large @xmath122 .    assuming that the pion pole dominance for the @xmath123 term holds",
    " we will return to this later  we can compare it with what follows from the ope . from eq.([wlmne0 ] ) the coefficient of @xmath123 is @xmath124 while the ope relation ( [ d3 ] ) gives for this coefficient @xmath125 the @xmath126 part is not relevant to comparison : it corresponds to the mixing of pion with massive isoscalar states , a reflection of the u(1 ) anomaly in the linear in @xmath127 terms . keeping in mind that @xmath128 can be chosen",
    "arbitrarily we get @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the electric charge of the @xmath8 quark .",
    "this looks analogous to the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation for the pion mass @xcite , @xmath132 the gmor relation allows us to rewrite ( [ magsuc ] ) as a relation for the magnetic susceptibility @xmath97 defined in eq.([magmom ] ) , @xmath133    the @xmath31 dependence of the result for @xmath97 is consistent with large @xmath31 analysis .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath97 is in very good agreement with the qcd sum rule fit @xcite given in eq.([magmom1 ] ) .",
    "what remains questionable is the pion dominance , which we will discuss in a little bit more detail .    to this end",
    "it is instructive to compare the construction above with the ope derivation of the gmor relation ( [ gmor ] ) made in ref.@xcite .",
    "the object of consideration in this case was the polarization operator @xmath134 of the axial current @xmath135 . in its longitudinal part the @xmath84 operators give @xmath136",
    "comparing this with the @xmath137 term coming from the expansion in the pion pole one gets the gmor relation ( [ gmor ] ) .",
    "it is crucial that only the pion state contributes to the linear in @xmath127 ( or in @xmath138 terms in the longitudinal part of @xmath134 , all the higher states give quadratic in quark masses contributions . indeed , the coupling of those states to the axial current is linear in quark masses and it is the square of this coupling which enters @xmath139 . in the case of the longitudinal part of @xmath48 the coupling of higher states to",
    "the axial current enters only once , so the higher states do contribute in the linear in quark masses order .",
    "thus , the pion dominance is not parametrical for @xmath140 .",
    "a clear signal of presence of higher states follows from a nonvanishing anomalous dimension of the operator ( [ fop ] ) .",
    "it means that the operator ( [ fop ] ) ( in contrast with the operator @xmath141 entering the gmor relation ( [ gmor ] ) ) depends on the normalization point @xmath62 , and its ope coefficient @xmath142 besides power dependence on @xmath113 contains also the factor @xmath143^{16/9}$ ] , i.e.  power of @xmath144 .",
    "this logarithmic dependence is apparently related to the higher states contribution . to justify the pion dominance we have to assume matching of the @xmath123 terms from the ope and the pion pole below the higher states .",
    "it implies a low normalization point , probably @xmath145 .",
    "the result ( [ magsuc1 ] ) can be compared with a different approach to calculation of @xmath97 based on matching of the vector meson dominance with the ope for the product of the electromagnetic current @xmath17 and operator ( [ fop ] ) .",
    "this approach was suggested first in ref .",
    "@xcite and in its simplest form gives @xmath146 what is about 2.6 times smaller by magnitude than ( [ magsuc1 ] ) .",
    "the consideration was then improved in @xcite by use of the qcd sum rules , see also @xcite for a recent review and update .",
    "the largest by magnitude value @xmath147=-1/(420~{\\rm mev})^2 $ ] obtained in @xcite is still 1.5 times smaller than ( [ magsuc1 ] ) .",
    "a phenomenology of processes sensitive to the susceptibility @xmath148 , see @xcite , will possibly help to fix its value .",
    "the quark triangles in special kinematics with one soft photon are similar to polarization operators : in this case it is a nondiagonal mixing of the axial and vector currents in the background of a soft vector field . in this kinematics",
    "we find that perturbative gluon corrections are absent in the chiral limit not only for the longitudinal part but for the transversal part as well . at the nonperturbative level",
    "the transversal part is corrected in contrast with the longitudinal one . in this respect",
    "the hadronic shift in the transversal part represents an object similar to the quark condensate : it appears only at nonperturbative level .",
    "we also derive a new expression for the quark condensate magnetic susceptibility using the ope and pion dominance in the longitudinal part of t - product of axial and two vector currents .",
    "this expression is similar to the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation between pion and quark masses which also can be derived by the ope method .",
    "the crucial difference is , however , that the pion dominance is parametrically valid for the gmor relation but not for the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "although theoretical accuracy of the new relation is not clear it would be interesting to follow further its phenomenological consequences .",
