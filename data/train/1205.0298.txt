    "the classical tutte polynomial was first introduced as a sum over the spanning trees of a graph @xcite .",
    "b. bollobs and o. riordan extended the tutte polynomial to ribbon graphs in @xcite , and proved a spanning tree expansion for this extended polynomial .",
    "however , recent work on the bollobs - riordan polynomial has suggested that one - face spanning subgraphs ( which are known as _ quasi - trees _ ) are more natural to consider than spanning trees in the case of ribbon graphs .",
    "a. champanerkar , i. kofman , and n. stoltzfus gave an expansion of the bollobs - riordan polynomial over the quasi - trees of an orientable ribbon graph @xcite .",
    "this expansion was extended to non - orientable ribbon graphs independently by f. vignes - tourneret @xcite and e. dewey @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this quasi - tree expansion was applied to derive an expansion of the kaufmann bracket polynomial of a virtual link diagram over connected states .",
    "quasi - trees have seen use outside of graph polynomials : in @xcite the quasi - trees of a ribbon graph associated to a link diagram are used to construct the khovanov homology .",
    "v. krushkal introduced a new polynomial invariant of graphs embedded into orientable surfaces in @xcite .",
    "this polynomial satisfies a natural duality relation in the case of a cellularly embedded graph , as well as some mild contraction - deletion properties , and contains the bollobs - riordan polynomial as a specialization .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the krushkal polynomial also contains the las vergnas polynomial of a cellularly embedded graph as a specialization , and that the specializations giving the bollobs - riordan polynomial and las vergnas polynomial are independent .",
    "the krushkal polynomial has also been extended to triangulations of even - dimensional oriented manifolds , for which a similar duality property holds @xcite .",
    "this paper consists of four major sections . in the first , a generalization of the krushkal polynomial to graphs embedded into any compact ( possibly non - orientable ) surface is given .",
    "we show that this generalized krushkal polynomial retains all of the familiar properties of the krushkal polynomial , including the duality relation .",
    "this generalization is motivated by a desire to capture the bollobs - riordan polynomial for all ribbon graphs ( not just orientable graphs ) as a specialization of a krushkal - like polynomial .    in the second section ,",
    "we review the essential properties of the quasi - tree grouping of the family of spanning subgraphs of a ribbon graph with a total ordering on the edges , following @xcite .",
    "the third section contains the main result of the paper .",
    "a quasi - tree expansion for the generalized krushkal polynomial is formulated and proven .",
    "the natural duality of the generalized krushkal polynomial forces this expansion to take a particularly nice form . in the fourth and final section ,",
    "we apply the main result to obtain a quasi - tree expansion for the krushkal polynomial and to rederive the bollobs - riordan quasi - tree expansions given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , using the fact that the generalized krushkal polynomial contains the bollobs - riordan polynomial as a specialization .",
    "lastly , we extend the main theorem of @xcite to the generalized krushkal polynomial , thus proving that the generalized krushkal polynomial contains the las vergnas polynomial as a specialization as well , and use this fact to derive a quasi - tree expansion for the las vergnas polynomial .",

    "we generally will not refer to the embedding @xmath6 explicitly and will simply identify @xmath1 with its image in @xmath2 .",
    "thus we will speak of @xmath1 as being a cellulation of @xmath2 . for a cellulation @xmath1 of @xmath2 , we may construct a new cellulation @xmath21 of @xmath2 as follows : place one vertex in each connected component of @xmath22 , and for each edge @xmath23 of @xmath1 , connect the vertices of @xmath21 corresponding to the components of @xmath22 on either side of @xmath23 by an edge @xmath24 which cuts @xmath23 transversely .",

    ". the induced embedding of @xmath1 in the resulting surface is then a cellulation .",
    "we will thus refer to @xmath1 interchangeably as a ribbon graph and as an embedded graph when @xmath1 is a cellulation .",
    "poincar duality of ribbon graphs takes the form of the following construction : for a ribbon graph @xmath1 , we glue a disc to each of the boundary components of @xmath1 ( which we take to be the vertices of @xmath21 ) , and delete the vertices of @xmath1 .      we seek now a natural extension of the krushkal polynomial to graphs embedded into nonorientable surfaces .",
    "when @xmath2 is orientable and @xmath3 is a spanning subgraph of a graph @xmath1 embedded in @xmath2 , we note that the invariants @xmath30 , @xmath31 are given by the formulas @xmath32 @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the euler characteristic of the surface .",
