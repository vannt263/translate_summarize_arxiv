    "the study of downlink beamforming and power control in cellular systems has been an active area of research for many years .",
    "conventionally , most of the related works have focused on a single - cell setup , where the co - channel interferences experienced by the mobile stations ( mss ) in a particular cell caused by the base stations ( bss ) of the other cells are treated as additional noises at the receivers . for this setup , the downlink transmission in a single cell with a multi - antenna bs and multiple single-/multi - antenna mss can be modeled by a multiple - input single-/multiple - output ( miso / mimo ) broadcast channel ( bc ) .",
    "it is known that the dirty paper coding ( dpc ) technique achieves the capacity region for the gaussian miso / mimo bc , which constitutes all the simultaneously achievable rates for all the mss @xcite .",
    "however , dpc requires complicated nonlinear encoding and decoding schemes and is thus difficult to implement in real - time systems .",
    "consequently , linear transmit and receive beamforming schemes for the gaussian miso / mimo bc have drawn a great deal of attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , a simple linear precoding scheme for the mimo bc is known as block diagonalization ( bd ) @xcite . with bd , the transmitted signal from the bs intended for each ms is multiplied by a precoding matrix , which is restricted to be orthogonal to the downlink channels associated with all the other mss .",
    "thereby , all the inter - user interferences are eliminated and each ms perceives an interference - free mimo channel . in the special case of miso bc , bd reduces to the well - known zero - forcing beamforming ( zf - bf ) @xcite .",
    "although bd is in general inferior in terms of achievable rate as compared to the dpc - based optimal nonlinear precoding scheme or the minimum - mean - squared - error ( mmse)-based optimal linear precoding scheme , it performs very well in the high signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) regime and achieves the same degrees of freedom ( dof ) for the miso-/mimo - bc sum - rate as the optimal linear / nonlinear precoding schemes @xcite . moreover , bd can be generalized to incorporate nonlinear dpc processing , which leads to a precoding scheme known as zf - dpc @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a rapidly growing interest in shifting the design paradigm from the conventional single - cell downlink transmission to the multi - cell cooperative downlink transmission @xcite . in these studies",
    ", it is assumed that bss in a cellular network are connected via backhaul links to a central processing unit ( e.g. , a dedicated control station or a preassigned bs ) , which has the global knowledge of transmit messages for all the mss in the network and downlink channels from each bs to all the mss .",
    "thereby , the central processing unit is able to jointly design the downlink transmissions for all bss and provide them appropriate signals to transmit . as demonstrated in these works , by utilizing the co - channel interference across different cells in a coherent fashion , the cooperative multi - cell downlink processing leads to enormous throughput gains as compared to the conventional single - cell processing with the co - channel interference treated as noise .",
    "moreover , design of distributed multi - cell downlink beamforming via the use of belief propagation and message passing among bss has also been recently proposed in @xcite , without the need of a central controller .    in this work",
    ", we focus our study on the bd - based downlink precoding for a fully cooperative multi - cell system equipped with a central processing unit , which is assumed to have the perfect knowledge of all downlink channels and transmit messages in the network . for this setup",
    ", the bd precoding design problem can be formulated in an auxiliary miso / mimo bc with the number of transmitting antennas equal to the sum of those from all the cooperative bss .",
    "however , instead of adopting the conventional sum - power constraint for the auxiliary miso / mimo bc as in prior works @xcite , this paper applies a set of transmit power constraints equivalent to those for individual bss in the multi - cell system .",
    "the bd precoder design problem subject to per - bs power constraints is relatively new , and has been studied in , e.g. , @xcite . in these works , the bd precoders are designed essentially following the same principle as for the conventional sum - power constraint case , i.e. , the precoding vectors known for the sum - power constraint case are adopted , and then power allocation is optimization to maximize the sum - rate under per - bs power constraints .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the developed bd precoder solutions therein are indeed optimal for the weighted sum - rate maximization in a cooperative multi - cell system . in this paper , we show that the bd precoder designs following the heuristic of _ separating _ the beamforming design and power allocation optimization are indeed suboptimal for rate maximization , while the optimal bd precoder solution requires a new _ joint _ optimization approach , as will be proposed in this paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the computation problem for the achievable rate region of the gaussian miso / mimo bc subject to per - antenna power constraints has been studied in @xcite .",
    "this work has been recently extended in @xcite to deal with more general linear transmit power constraints for the miso / mimo bc , with the per - antenna power constraint as a special case .",
    "the results in @xcite can be directly applied for a cooperative multi - cell system to handle the per - bs power constraints , if the dpc - based optimal nonlinear precoder or the mmse - based optimal linear precoder is used . on the other hand ,",
    "the zf - bf precoding design , as a simplified version of bd for the case of miso bc , has been studied in @xcite subject to per - antenna power constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "the zf - bf precoding matrix is taken as the pseudo inverse of the miso - bc channel matrix and thereby decomposes the miso bc into parallel interference - free scalar sub - channels for different mss . the power allocation over the sub - channels",
    "is then optimized under per - antenna power constraints . however , it was pointed out in @xcite that although the zf - bf precoding matrix for the miso bc based on the channel pseudo inverse is optimal for the sum - power constraint case , it is in general suboptimal for the per - antenna power constraint case .",
    "thus , in @xcite the authors proposed to apply the principle of generalized matrix inverse to design the zf - bf precoding with per - antenna power constraints .",
    "the scheme in @xcite has been improved in terms of computational efficiency and extended to the case of general linear power constraints in @xcite . however",
    ", these miso - bc zf - bf solutions can not be applied to obtain the optimal bd precoder design for the more general mimo bc with per - bs power constraints .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we formulate the mimo - bc transmit optimization problem with the bd precoding and equivalent per - bs power constraints as a convex optimization problem . by applying convex optimization techniques , we design an efficient algorithm to solve this problem .",
    "we also derive the closed - form expression of the optimal bd precoding matrix to maximize the weighted sum - rate for the mimo - bc , from which we obtain a lower bound on the number of bss that should transmit with their maximum power levels .",
    "more importantly , we prove that the optimal bd precoding ( beamforming ) vectors for each ms in the case of per - bs power constraints are in general _ non - orthogonal _ , which differs from the conventional orthogonal bd precoder design for the sum - power constraint case",
    ". consequently , the orthogonal bd precoder designs proposed in prior works @xcite for the per - bs power constraint case are in general suboptimal ( for weighted sum - rate maximization ) . * for the special case of single - antenna bss and mss , we show that the proposed bd precoding design for the mimo - bc provides the optimal zf - bf precoder solution to maximize the weighted sum - rate for the miso bc with per - antenna power constraints .",
    "we also compare the proposed solution with existing ones in prior works @xcite based on approaches such as the generalized channel matrix inverse and the semi - definite programming ( sdp ) with rank - one relaxation .",
    "* we also present a low - complexity , suboptimal scheme for the studied problem , which is obtained by computing the conventional bd precoder design for the sum - power constraint case with an optimal power allocation to meet the per - bs power constraints .",
    "this scheme can be considered as an extension of that given in @xcite for the miso bc with the zf - bf precoding and per - antenna power constraints to the mimo bc with the bd precoding and per - bs power constraints .",
    "we derive an upper bound on the maximum number of bss transmitting with their full power levels for this scheme , and identify the conditions under which this scheme becomes sum - rate optimal .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath58 .",
    "the overall downlink transmit covariance matrix for the @xmath33 cooperative transmitting antennas is then @xmath59 .",
    "since these transmitting antennas come from more than one bs , they need to satisfy a set of per - bs power constraints expressed as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denotes the per - bs power constraint , which is assumed identical for all the bss .",
    "note that in the special case of single - antenna bss and mss , i.e. , @xmath63 , the per - bs power constraints in ( [ eq : per bs power constraint ] ) reduce to the per - antenna power constraints for an equivalent miso bc .",
    "we assume a quasi - static fading environment and thus the channels of interest in the auxiliary mimo - bc remain constant for each downlink transmission frame .",
    "we consider the bd precoding scheme for each downlink frame transmission in the mimo bc , which eliminates the inter - user interference , i.e. , in ( [ eq : signal model ] ) we have that for each given @xmath43 , @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "it is easy to show that the above `` zf constraints '' are equivalent to the following constraints @xmath66 assuming that the row vectors in all @xmath67 s are linearly independent ( due to independent fading ) , from the constraints in ( [ eq : zf constraints ] ) with @xmath68 , it follows that @xmath69 needs to be true in order to have a set of feasible @xmath70 s with @xmath71 , i.e. , all the mss have the same number of data streams equal to @xmath31 . in practice , the total number of mss in the system can be very large such that the above condition is not satisfied .",
    "in such scenarios , the transmissions to mss can be scheduled into different time - slots or frequency - bands by the central processing unit , where in each time - slot / frequency - band , the number of mss scheduled for transmission satisfies the above condition .",
    "the interested readers may refer to @xcite for the detailed design of downlink transmission scheduling in the miso / mimo bc with zf - bf / bd precoding . for the rest of this paper , we assume that @xmath72 and @xmath69 for simplicity .",
    "we are now ready to present the weighted sum - rate maximization problem for the downlink transmission in a cooperative multi - cell system with the bd precoding and per - bs power constraints as follows .",

    ", we assume that @xmath75 .",
    "note that in ( p1 ) , we have used transmit covariance matrices @xmath70 s instead of precoding matrices @xmath76 s as design variables .",
    "this is because with @xmath70 s , it is easy to verify that ( p1 ) is a convex optimization problem , since the objective function is concave over @xmath70 s and all the constraints specify a convex set over @xmath70 s .",
    "thus , ( p1 ) can be solved using standard convex optimization techniques , e.g. , the interior - point method @xcite .",
    "however , such an approach does not reveal the structure of the optimal bd precoding solution .",
    "therefore , in this paper we take a different approach to solve ( p1 ) , which is based on the lagrange duality method @xcite for convex optimization problems . as will be shown in section [ sec : optimal ] , this approach leads to a closed - form expression for the optimal bd precoding matrix , and reveals some interesting properties of the optimal solution .",
    "it is worth noting that ( p1 ) can be modified to incorporate additional per - antenna power constraints at all the bss .",

    "given a fixed encoding order for the transmitted signals to different mss ( without loss of generality , we assume that the encoding order is given by the ms index ) , the signal for a later encoded ms is designed with the non - causal knowledge of all the earlier encoded ms signals , of which the associated interferences can be precanceled by dpc . by extending the zf - dpc scheme in @xcite for the miso bc to the case of mimo bc , ( p1 )",

    "in this section , we first present a new algorithm to solve ( p1 ) , which reveals the structure of the optimal bd precoding matrix for the general case with arbitrary numbers of antennas at the bs or ms .",

    "thus , ( p1 ) reduces to the following equivalent problem @xmath109 similar to ( p1 ) , it can be shown that ( p2 ) is convex .",
    "thus , ( p2 ) is solvable by the lagrange duality method as follows . by introducing a set of non - negative dual variables , @xmath110 , associated with the set of per - bs power constraints in ( p2 ) ,",

    "are given by @xmath157    in the following remarks , we discuss some interesting observations on the optimal bd precoding matrices given by ( [ eq : optimal tk ] ) .",
    "one desirable property of linear precoding for a point - to - point mimo channel is that the precoding matrix , when jointly deployed with a unitary decoding matrix at the receiver , is able to diagonalize the mimo channel into parallel scalar sub - channels , over which independent encoding and decoding can be applied to simplify the transceiver design . here , we verify that the optimal @xmath158 given in ( [ eq : optimal tk ] ) satisfies this `` channel diagonalization '' property , as follows : @xmath159 where ( [ eq : line a ] ) is due to ( [ eq : svd ] ) .",
    "therefore , with a unitary decoding matrix @xmath160 applied at the @xmath43th ms receiver , the mimo channel for the @xmath43th ms with bd precoding is diagonalized into @xmath31 scalar sub - channels with channel gains given by the main diagonal of the diagonal matrix @xmath161 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the above linear precoder and decoder processing preserves the single - user mimo channel capacity .",
    "it is noted that ( p1 ) can be modified to deal with the case where a single sum - power constraint over all the bss ( instead of a set of per - bs power constraints ) is applied .",
    "this can be done via replacing the set of per - bs power constraints in ( p1 ) by @xmath162 where @xmath163 denotes the given sum - power constraint .",
    "note that ( p1 ) in this case corresponds to the conventional bd precoder design problem for the mimo bc with a sum - power constraint as studied in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the developed solution for ( p1 ) can be applied to this case , while the corresponding matrix @xmath164 should be modified as @xmath165 with @xmath166 denoting the optimal dual solution associated with the sum - power constraint in ( [ eq : sum power constraint ] ) . from ( [ eq : optimal sk ] ) , it follows that the optimal solution for this modified version of ( p1 ) is given by @xmath167 moreover , from ( [ eq : svd ] ) with @xmath168 , it follows that @xmath169 is obtained from the svd : @xmath170 and is thus independent of @xmath166 .",

    "this is the very reason that the bd precoder designs in prior works @xcite based on the orthogonal precoder structure @xmath172 are in general suboptimal for the per - bs power constraint case .      in this subsection",

    "lemma [ lemma:3 ] provides an upper bound on the number of active per - bs power constraints for the suboptimal solution of ( p1 ) obtained by ( a2 ) .",
    "it follows that in the case of @xmath262 , most of the bss in the cooperative multi - cell system can not transmit with their full power levels with the suboptimal bd precoder design obtained by ( a2 ) .",
    "in this section , we provide numerical examples to illustrate the results in this paper . for the purpose of exposition",

    "moreover , we consider the sum - rate maximization for the cooperative multi - cell downlink transmission , i.e. , @xmath74 s are all equal to one in ( p1 ) .",

    "the initial values assigned to @xmath115 s in ( a1 ) are @xmath266 .",
    "the achievable sum - rate and the consumed transmit powers by the two bss are shown for different iterations in ( a1 ) , each with a pair of updated values for @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",

    "the converged transmit powers for the two bss are observed both equal to their given constraint value , which is @xmath265 . a similar convergence behavior for algorithm ( a2 ) can be observed and thus omitted here .",
    "generally speaking , the convergence speed of both ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) depends critically on the total number of per - bs power constraints , @xmath23 , which is also the number of dual variable @xmath115 s to be searched . with the ellipsoid method",
    ", it is known that the complexity for searching @xmath115 s in ( a1 ) or ( a2 ) is @xmath270 for large values of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus , the number of iterations for the algorithm convergence grows asymptotically in the order of the square of the number of bss in the system .",
    "next , we consider a special case of the cooperative multi - cell downlink transmission with @xmath63 , which is equivalent to a miso bc with the corresponding per - antenna power constraints .",

    "it is observed that when @xmath274 , the achievable rates for both the optimal and suboptimal precoders are identical , which is in accordance with our discussions in section [ sec : suboptimal ] .",
    "it is also observed that when @xmath259 , the sum - rate gain of the optimal precoder solution over the suboptimal solution increases with @xmath33 . in order to explain this observation , in fig .",

    "we thus see that when @xmath33 becomes much larger than @xmath30 for the miso bc , the optimal zf - bf design can utilize the full transmit powers from at least @xmath279 antennas , while the suboptimal design can only have at most @xmath30 antennas transmitting with their full powers .",

    "we assume that @xmath280 , and @xmath264 .",
    "note that in this case although @xmath281 , i.e. , the total number of transmitting antennas are equal to that of receiving antennas , ( a2 ) in general leads to a suboptimal solution for ( p1 ) due to the fact that @xmath282 . in fig .",
