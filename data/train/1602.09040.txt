    "this problem is a very special , yet fairly rich case of the more general problem of finding time periodic solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equations above , with the unit disc @xmath8 replaced by any simply connected smooth domain @xmath9 and any boundary condition @xmath10 our approach to obtaining periodic solutions to will be variational in nature .",

    "the time - periodic solutions to gross - pitaevskii that we construct are rotational , in the sense of an ansatz that we explain below in . roughly , the vortices of our time periodic solutions rotate at a uniform angular velocity about the origin of the unit disc",
    ". the vortex configurations from the celebrated rotating bucket experiment , cf .",
    "@xcite , bear resemblance to those explored in this paper . however the emergence of vortices in experiments is achieved through an externally driven rotation of the domain , whereas here the presence of vortices is topologically enforced through the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation , also occasionally referred to as the ginzburg - landau - schrdinger equation , is a hamiltonian system .",
    "consequently , the flow defined by solutions to conserves the ginzburg - landau energy @xmath11 existence of minimizers @xmath7 of with respect to a dirichlet boundary condition @xmath12 , is an easy consequence of the direct method in the calculus of variations , whereas characterizing the limiting behavior of @xmath7 as @xmath13 is challenging and was the subject of @xcite .",
    "the basic theme developed in @xcite is this : the second term favors @xmath14 whereas the brouwer degree of @xmath15 forces @xmath16 to have vortices , i.e. zeroes carrying nonzero degree .",
    "this competition results in logarithmic divergence of the energy @xmath17 as @xmath18 if we _",

    "the theory of @xmath20convergence of a sequence of functionals @xmath21 to its @xmath20limit @xmath22 in some topology @xmath23 has its origins in relating global minimizers of @xmath21 to global minimizers of a limiting functional @xmath24 as some small parameter @xmath18 from a physical standpoint , the dependence of the functionals @xmath21 on @xmath25 might signify the dependence of the underlying physical theory on some seemingly negligible yet significant parameter @xmath26 the asymptotic analysis from @xmath20convergence then captures an _ effective theory _ that does include the effects of the parameter @xmath26 somewhat surprisingly , @xmath20convergence has subsequently proven to be a remarkable vehicle in other asymptotic analyses pertaining to the functionals @xmath21 and @xmath27 we recall a few such surprises that are known in abstract generality , along with applications of these general theorems :    * in @xcite , the authors demonstrate that given an isolated local minimizer of @xmath24 one can use @xmath20convergence to construct local minimizers of the functionals @xmath21 for all sufficiently small @xmath26 when the limiting problem @xmath22 is geometric , their theorem reduces the task of solving nonlinear partial differential equations to solving a geometric problem which is often easier to visualize .",

    ", they applied their abstract theorem to recover the asymptotics of solutions to the parabolic ginzburg landau system proven in @xcite and @xcite , and also prove asymptotics of gradient flow of the magnetic ginzburg - landau energy via variational methods , recovering the results of @xcite where these asymptotics were proved using pde methods .",

    "we have adapted the localized linking argument in the proof of this result from @xcite .",
    "we present asymptotics of the periodic solutions constructed in theorem [ thm : existence ] in theorem [ thm : asymptotics ] , where we rely heavily on the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the starting point of both the constrained minimization approach and the min - max approach is to pursue solutions of - within a rotation ansatz given in below that was originally suggested to us by professor robert l jerrard in the case @xmath43 of a single vortex .",
    "a salient feature of our min - max approach that distinguishes it , for example from @xcite is that we are able to capture periodic orbits of gross - pitaevskii containing vortices of opposite degrees @xmath44 to the best of our knowledge , in the presence of a dirichlet boundary condition , such solutions to that do not succumb to finite time vortex annihilation are new . in particular , as @xmath6 these solutions follow the point vortex system _ for all time_.    the point vortex system is a system of ordinary differential equations that govern the dynamics of limiting vortices of gross pitaevskii .",
    "they arise from the re - normalized energy identified in @xcite by considering its hamiltonian flow .",
    "this system of ode s also arises in fluid mechanics , and corresponds to the euler equations , with vorticity given by a sum of dirac deltas , see @xcite chapter 4 for a precise statement .",
