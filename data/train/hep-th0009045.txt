    "discrete torsion was introduced many years ago by vafa in @xcite .",
    "more recently douglas @xcite introduced an alternative picture in terms of d - branes .",
    "the purpose of this note is to show the equivalence of these pictures . since both of these papers were very brief as regards to the general case we will review both constructions here .    in general",
    "a worldsheet @xmath0 of genus @xmath1 and no boundary will be associated to a given phase dictated by the @xmath2-field and the homology class of the worldsheet in the target space .",
    "vafa wanted to generalize this notion of a @xmath2-field to the case of orbifolds with fixed points .    in order to localize the picture",
    "let us consider a discrete group @xmath3 acting on @xmath4 where the origin is fixed by all of @xmath3 .",
    "the worldsheet @xmath0 on this orbifold may be pictured as a disk in the covering @xmath4 where the edges of the disk are identified by elements of the action of @xmath3 .",
    "that is , the usual homology 1-cycles of the worldsheet @xmath0 are twisted by elements of @xmath3 .",
    "the twisting of these cycles in @xmath0 may be viewed as a @xmath3-bundle on @xmath0 .",
    "the holonomy of this bundle is given precisely by the twist associated to a given loop .",
    "since @xmath3 is a discrete group , this bundle is flat .",
    "such a bundle is classified by the homotopy class of a mapping @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the classifying space for the group @xmath3 .",
    "that is , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "in this way , @xmath6 in the case of an orbifold plays a rather similar role to the target space of the usual string theory .",
    "vafa s idea was to define the discrete torsion version of the @xmath2-field as @xmath10 because of this analogy .",
    "the connection between the @xmath2-field and group cohomology has been clarified recently by the work of sharpe @xcite .",
    "now group ( co)homology , which is defined as the ( co)homology of @xmath6 , can be described algebraically directly in terms of @xmath3 as we now show . in order to complete the description of discrete torsion we need to describe the above picture in terms of this more intrinsic definition .",
    "let @xmath11 be the _ group ring _ of @xmath3 .",
    "that is , any element of @xmath11 may be written uniquely as @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "now let @xmath14 be a free resolution of @xmath15 as a @xmath11-module .",
    "this is an exact sequence of @xmath11-modules where @xmath16 is a free @xmath11-module for any @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath3-action on @xmath15 is taken to be trivial .",
    "now define @xmath18 as the @xmath3-coinvariant projection of @xmath16 .",
    "that is , we divide @xmath16 by the equivalence @xmath19 for any @xmath20 . since @xmath16 is a free @xmath11-module , @xmath18 will be a free @xmath15-module , i.e. , a free abelian group .",
    "the homology of the induced complex @xmath21 is then equal to @xmath22 , the homology of @xmath3 .",
    "see section ii.4 of @xcite , for example , for a proof that this equals @xmath23 .",
    "one way to explicitly compute @xmath22 is via the `` bar resolution '' as follows .",
    "let @xmath16 be generated by @xmath24-tuples of the form @xmath25 where the @xmath3-action is defined as @xmath26 the boundary map @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where the hat indicates omission as usual . because of the @xmath3-action , we may use @xmath29 as a basis for @xmath16 or @xmath18 .",
    "the `` bar '' notation is to write @xmath30 = ( 1,g_1,g_1g_2,\\ldots , g_1g_2\\cdots g_n).\\ ] ] we will generally consider the homology of @xmath3 in terms of the generators @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "one may show that a generator may be considered trivial if any of the entries @xmath32 are equal to 1 .",
    "it is also useful to note the explicit form of the boundary map in ( [ eq : free ] ) of a 3-chain in the bar notation : @xmath33 = [ b|c]-[ab|c]+[a|bc]-[a|b ] .",
    "\\label{eq:3c}\\ ] ]    so how is the homology class of @xmath0 in @xmath6 described in terms of these bar chains ?",
    "the free resolution ( [ eq : zgfree ] ) is actually an augmented simplicial chain complex , @xmath34 , as follows .",
    "let the elements of @xmath3 be viewed as the vertices of @xmath34 .",
    "now let @xmath25 be the @xmath17-dimensional simplex in @xmath34 with the corresponding vertices .",
    "thus we have exactly one simplex in @xmath34 for every possible sequence of group elements .",
    "the group @xmath3 acts on @xmath34 to give the complex ( [ eq : free ] ) as a quotient .",
    "as far as homology is concerned , the abstract simplicial complex @xmath35 is a perfectly good representative for @xmath6 .",
    "we may now take a simplicial decomposition of @xmath0 and explicitly map it into this simplicial picture of @xmath6 .",
    "this will relate the homology of @xmath0 , and in particular its fundamental class , to the homology of @xmath3 . as a simple example let us consider a torus as shown in figure  [ fig : torus ] .",
    "this torus consists of one cycle twisted by the action of @xmath36 and another cycle twisted by the action of @xmath37 .",
    "the topology of the torus dictates that @xmath38 .",
    "the figure shows the labels of the vertices in terms of the group action and it also shows a simple simplicial decomposition .",
    "we are free to label one vertex as `` 1 '' . in terms of the image of this torus in our peculiar simplicial model of @xmath6",
    "we see that @xmath39 corresponds to a simplex @xmath40 and @xmath41 corresponds to a simplex @xmath42 . as usual in simplicial homology one needs to be careful about relative signs .",
    "the fundamental class of @xmath0 is given by @xmath43 so that the diagonal line in figure  [ fig : torus ] cancels for the boundary of @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 & = ( 1,a , ab)-(1,b , ab)\\\\             & = [ a|b]-[b|a ] ,    \\label{eq : g1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] in terms of the bar chains .",
    "applying @xmath45 to this bar resolution we may go over to the group cohomology picture .",
    "a group @xmath17-cochain can now be viewed as a map from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if @xmath48 then @xmath49 for @xmath50 . from ( [ eq:3c ] )",
    "we see that a 2-cochain is closed if @xmath51    if discrete torsion is written in terms of the @xmath52 cocycles then ( [ eq : g1 ] ) is translated in vafa s language into the statement that the phase associated to a genus one riemann surface is given by @xmath53    this is the result quoted in @xcite .",
    "this method may be applied equally well to higher genus worldsheets .",
    "the genus two case is shown in figure  [ fig : g2 ] together with a specific simplicial decomposition .",
    "it follows that @xmath54 = [ a_1|b_1]-[\\gamma|b_1a_1]-[b_1|a_1]+[a_2|b_2 ]                 + [ \\gamma|a_2b_2]-[b_2|a_2],\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , which by the topology of a genus two surface must equal @xmath56 .",
    "note that if @xmath57 , which would happen if @xmath3 were abelian for example , then the genus two homology class simply breaks into @xmath58-[b_1|a_1])+([a_2|b_2]-[b_2|a_2])$ ] which is the sum of two genus one classes .",
    "this does _ not _ happen in general if @xmath59 .",
    "one may view this statement in terms of a genus two surface degenerating into two genus one surfaces touching at a point .",
    "such a degeneration is topologically obstructed if @xmath59 .",
    "there are many ways of performing a simplicial decomposition of @xmath0 in general .",
    "one may show that changing the decomposition will simply change @xmath60 $ ] in the computations above by the boundary of a group 3-chain and hence has no effect .",
    "in @xcite douglas introduced another definition of discrete torsion associated to projective representations which we now review .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of this construction .    consider the following central extension of @xmath3 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a set - theoretic map such that @xmath63 is the identity on @xmath3 .",
    "such extensions are classified by @xmath64 .",
    "the map @xmath62 defines a projective representation of @xmath3 .",
    "given @xmath48 written in terms of the bar resolution of the previous section one may show that @xcite @xmath65    douglas considered @xmath62 as a lift of an orbifold action to the chan - paton factors on the end of an open string .",
    "he then considered a riemann surface with a disk removed .",
    "such a surface can represent either a multi - loop open string diagram or a multi - loop tadpole - like diagram for a closed string .",
    "consider the genus two case shown in figure  [ fig:2a ] .",
    "when computing the amplitude of this diagram in the open string context one must include a trace of the group actions on the chan - paton elements along the boundary . as is clear from the figure , this boundary may be contracted to the outer polygon which is a sequence of 1-cycles which are twisted by elements of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath66 be this weighting of the amplitude .",
    "we then have @xmath67 where @xmath68 represent the associated twists . for a general genus @xmath1 surface",
    "we clearly have @xmath69 let @xmath70 .",
    "then the topology of the surface dictates that @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 and thus @xmath73 .",
    "it follows that @xmath74 .",
    "repeated use of ( [ eq : proj ] ) and ( [ eq : coc2 ] ) then gives . the case @xmath75 is left as an easy exercise for the reader . ]",
    "@xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "this formula was also derived in @xcite .",
    "now it is not hard to see that the final form of ( [ eq : big ] ) corresponds to a simplicial decomposition of a genus @xmath1 surface into @xmath78 triangles in the language of section  [ s : vafa ] .",
    "each @xmath52 factor represents one triangle oriented in just the right way to build up the complete surface .",
    "we show the four triangles for a generic pair @xmath79 in figure  [ fig : gen ] .",
    "this factor @xmath80 is exactly the same factor as we obtain by vafa s method of the previous section applied to this simplicial decomposition .",
    "thus we see that vafa s and douglas s definition of discrete torsion agree in general .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank s.  katz , r.  plesser and e.  sharpe for useful conversations .",
