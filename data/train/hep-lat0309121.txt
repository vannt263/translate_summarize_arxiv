    "polyakov loop correlation functions are generally used to analyze the temperature dependence of confinement forces and the screening in the high temperature phase of qcd .",
    "the polyakov loop correlation functions are directly related to the _ change in free energy _ arising from the presence of a static quark anti - quark pair in a thermal medium , @xmath0 [ 1,2 ] .",
    "nonetheless , over the years it has become customary to call this observable the _ heavy quark potential at finite temperature_. the role of any additional entropy contribution at finite temperature thus has been ignored .",
    "we will discuss here a first calculation of the access energy ( potential ) from the access free energy of static heavy quark sources .",
    "we will concentrate on results from calculations of the singlet free energy , @xmath1 and will present results on color averaged and octet free energies elsewhere .",
    "the operator used to calculate @xmath2 is not gauge invariant .",
    "calculations thus have been performed in coulomb gauge .",
    "it has been shown in [ 3 ] that this approach is equivalent to using a suitably defined gauge invariant ( non - local ) operator for the singlet free energy .",
    "the polyakov loop , calculated on the lattice , is ultra - violet divergent and needs to be renormalized to become a meaningful observable in the continuum limit .",
    "we will do so by renormalizing the free energies at short distances .",
    "considering that no additional divergences arise from thermal effects and that at short distances the heavy quark free energies will not be sensitive to medium effects , renormalization is achieved through a matching of free energies to the zero temperature heavy quark potential . using the large distance behavior of the renormalized free energies we can define the renormalized polyakov loop which is well defined also in the continuum limit .",
    "at small distances the free energy of a quark anti - quark pair should essentially be temperature    = 6.7 cm    independent at distances which are smaller than the average separation between partons in the thermal medium .",
    "therefore , in the limit of small @xmath3 , the heavy quark free energy @xmath4 is supposed to be given by the heavy quark potential , @xmath5 , at zero temperature . by matching @xmath4 to the @xmath6=@xmath7-potential at small @xmath8 , the divergent self - energy contributions to the free energy are removed .",
    "= 6.7 cm    [ fig : feso ]    = 6.7 cm    = 6.7 cm    [ fig : csa ]    the singlet free energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fesb ] ) coincides with the @xmath6=@xmath7-potential at short distances and shows no temperature dependence up to @xmath9 .",
    "there is a significant overshooting of @xmath2 relative to the @xmath6=@xmath7-potential which may be understood in terms of string fluctuations . at large separation @xmath2 shows confining behavior with a string tension that is decreasing with increasing temperature",
    "this is a first indication that there are entropy contributions at large separations , while at small @xmath8 the entropy is zero .    above @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feso ] ) the free energy is again @xmath6-independent at small distances and coincides with the @xmath6=0-potential at sufficiently small @xmath8 . with increasing temperature screening sets in at shorter separation .",
    "@xmath2 decreases with increasing temperature at fixed @xmath8 , indicating that there is a positive entropy , @xmath11 , contribution at large distances , while it is close to zero , due to the ( asymptotic ) @xmath6-independence of @xmath2 , at small @xmath8 .",
    "the free energy has a quite complex @xmath8-dependence .",
    "it is not only determined by the potential energy but contains entropy contributions , which are also @xmath8-dependent ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the singlet free energy is temperature independent at sufficiently small distances , while it gets @xmath6-dependent at large @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to a vanishing entropy at small separation and a non - vanishing entropy at large @xmath8 .    in order to separate both contributions to the free energy",
    ", we calculate the derivatives with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath13    in fig .",
    "[ fig : csb ] the internal energy for three different temperatures below @xmath10 is shown . at small distances",
    "the data coincide with the @xmath6=@xmath7-potential , while at large separations they tend toward larger values with increasing temperature .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of the free energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fesb ] ) and shows that entropy contributions play a major role at finite temperature",
    ".    the internal energies above @xmath10 ( fig .  [ fig : csa ] ) also show major differences compared to the free energy . in the limit of small separations they turn into the @xmath6=@xmath7-potential . at intermediate @xmath8",
    "the potential becomes narrower ( overshooting ) which is a consequence of screening and finally leads to a flat potential at large distances .",
    "this behavior indicates that also above @xmath10 the free energy is not only controlled by the internal energy itself .",
    "using the renormalized free energies from fig .  [ fig : feso ] we can define the renormalized polyakov loop @xcite , @xmath14 in quenched qcd it is zero below @xmath10 by construction .",
    "@xmath15 does not depend on @xmath16 and is well behaved in the continuum limit .",
    "= 6.7 cm    [ fig : renp ]",
    "the concepts presented above can be extended to the case of full qcd , where string breaking has been observed in polyakov loop correlation functions in @xcite . in fig .",
