    "lorentz symmetry is cornerstone in the foundation of modern physics .",
    "the experimental tests of lorentz violation are also interested for a decade ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility of lorentz - violating field theory were intensively studied in the various contexts , including riemann - cartan geometry @xcite , riemann - finsler geometry @xcite , string theory @xcite , and noncommutative geometry @xcite . especially , a tensor field theory with dynamical lorentz symmetry violating such that the manifold of equivalent vacua after the violation is not shrinkable to a point may contain monopole solutions @xcite .",
    "there exist monopole solutions in the minimal model coupled to gravity @xcite for antisymmetric 2-tensor field , in which the far - field approximation and bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit are used .",
    "it is worth noting that above - mentioned solution is not exact one for the metric around a tensor monopole since it is not the solution of the equation of the tensor field .",
    "one must still find a solution of the coupled equations of motion valid throughout space .",
    "on the other hand , if the symmetry that is broken is a global symmetry of scalar fields , the gravitational effect of monopole configuration @xcite is equivalent to that of a deficit solid angle in the metric , plus that of a negative mass at the origin @xcite .",
    "the properties of scalar monopoles have been investigated in the various space - time @xcite .",
    "monopoles could be produced by the phase transition in the early universe and their existence has important implications in cosmology .",
    "it is possible that the monopole still exist as relic object in the universe today , since isolated topological defect is stable .",
    "if a tensor monopole were to be detected , it would offer precious enlightenment on fundamental symmetries in physics .",
    "for the scalar case , the internal symmetry is spontaneously broken , and lorentz symmetry is exact .",
    "on the contrary , lorentz symmetry will be broken by the vacuum solution in the tensor case . however , the signature of tensor monopole is effectively the same as a scalar one in the seifert s approximation .",
    "it is of course not possible to use tensor monopole set - ups to assess the existence of lorentz violation in this approximation .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel approach that might relax the above problem and open new possibilities for the detection of lorentz violation in future astrophysical observations .",
    "we show the realistic solution for the coupled system , and discuss its observational signatures . using standard techniques ,",
    "we have calculated the light ray propagating in these backgrounds .",
    "note that the deflection angles are dependent upon the `` apparent impact parameter '' .",
    "from this point of view , the signature of an antisymmetric tensor monopole can be distinguished from two species of monopoles in the future tests .",
    "moreover , the tensor monopole would provide inestimable insight into the role played by lorentz symmetry in physics .",
    "we consider the 1 + 3 dimensional action @xmath0 where the gravity part of the action is the usual einstein - hilbert action with the gravitational coupling constant @xmath1 and curvature scalar @xmath2 .",

    "let us mention , by the way , that the equation of motion is analogous between the tensor monopole and @xmath15 scalar monopole . in the both cases , no exact expression is known , although series method @xcite or numerical calculation @xcite can be used to approximate it for the @xmath15 monopole .",

    "both @xmath21 and @xmath24 are determined by eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) at the boundary between the interior and exterior region , which correspond to the continuity of the metric .",
