    "there are several interesting , unexplained phenomena in @xmath5 decays .",
    "first of all , the total production of charm and charmonium seems about 10% low @xcite , especially when coupled with a @xmath5 semileptonic branching ratio of ( 10.4@xmath60.3)% @xcite .",
    "secondly , cleo observed a very large rate of @xmath0 in the momentum range from 2 to 2.7 gev / c with a branching fraction of @xmath7 @xcite . the babar experiment has confirmed this large rate @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons is believed to occur dominantly via the @xmath8 mechanism , as strongly suggested by observation of the two - body decay @xmath9 .",
    "one explanation of the large @xmath0 rate is that the @xmath8 rate is not 1% as expected in the standard model , but is enhanced by new physics to be at the 10% level .",
    "this would also explain the charm deficit problem .",
    "an alternative explanation is that of an anomalously strong coupling between the @xmath0 and two gluons @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath8 followed by the two gluon coupling to the @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : btoetap ] .",
    "experimentally , the hadronic mass associated with @xmath10 sometimes is a @xmath11 , @xmath1210% , and even more rarely a @xmath13 , @xmath121% ; in fact , most of the rate has the mass of the @xmath10 system larger than 1.8 gev .",
    "since the @xmath0 is mostly the flavor singlet @xmath14 , as the @xmath15 mixing angle is between @xmath16 , the effective @xmath2 coupling can be written as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the four - momentum of the virtual hard gluon @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the four - momentum of the soft  on - shell \" gluon @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 transition form factor .    chen and kagan @xcite have shown that the region of the @xmath4 relevant in the process @xmath24 can also be accessed in high energy @xmath0 production in @xmath25 decay . thus constraints can be put on the @xmath22 from the @xmath0 spectrum in @xmath26 decays .",
    "@xmath27 is found from the rate of @xmath28 decays as @xmath121.8 gev@xmath29 .",
    "three choices for the form factor shape @xmath22 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2dep ] : ( a ) a slowly falling form factor from hou and tseng @xcite , @xmath30 ; ( b ) a rapidly falling form factor representative of perturbative qcd calculations , @xmath31 gev@xmath29m@xmath32 at @xmath33 1 gev@xmath34 ; ( c ) an intermediate example with @xmath35 @xcite . in ( b ) and ( c ) the form factor at @xmath36 has been matched onto the value given in ( a ) , which is fixed by the qcd anomaly @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of the form factor in ( b ) follows from a simple model in which the @xmath37 is coupled perturbatively to two gluons through quark loops @xcite . with the choice @xmath38 gev@xmath29 it compares well with the perturbative qcd form factors obtained by other authors @xcite .",
    "we will compare the theoretical predictions for @xmath22 with data taken on the @xmath39 resonance with the cleo ii detector at the cesr storage ring .",
    "some information on this topic has been extracted by kagan from argus data @xcite .",
    "in this study we use 80 pb@xmath29 of cleo ii data recorded at the @xmath39 resonance ( 9.46 gev ) , containing @xmath40 @xmath39 events .",
    "we also use off - resonance continuum data collected below the @xmath41 resonance ( 10.52 gev ) with a total integrated luminosity of 1193 pb@xmath29 .",
    "the theoretical predictions referred to in this paper are made for @xmath39 decays into three gluons ( @xmath42 ) . in order to compare our measurement to them",
    "we have to correct for the @xmath43 contribution , whose size is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xcite and the @xmath46 is taken as @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "although several processes can contribute to inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath39 decays , it is believed that the soft processes including fragmentation populate only the low @xmath4 or equivalently the low z region , where @xmath48 thus in the large z region significant @xmath0 production would indicate a large @xmath49 coupling .    the cleo ii detector , described in detail elsewhere @xcite had a high resolution electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of 7800 csi crystals surrounding a precision tracking system .",
    "we detect @xmath0 mesons using the decay channel : @xmath50 with a branching fraction of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with a branching fraction of @xmath53 .",
    "we identify single photons based on their shower shape and the non - proximity of charged tracks . those photon pairs within the  good barrel \" region of the detector , @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the angle with respect to the beam ) , that have invariant masses consistent with the @xmath56 mass within 3 standard deviations are constrained to have the invariant mass of the @xmath56 . for @xmath56 mesons coming from low energy @xmath0 candidates ( @xmath57 )",
    "the background from @xmath58 decay is large , and thus the candidate photons are also required not to be from a possible @xmath58 decay .",
    "we then add two opposite sign pions and form the @xmath59 invariant mass .",
    "the @xmath59 invariant mass spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xm1sa ] for @xmath39 and for off - resonance continuum data .",
    "the spectra are fit with a gaussian function for signal and second order polynomial function for background .",
    "the numbers of reconstructed @xmath0 are extracted from the fit .",
    "we find @xmath60 from the @xmath25 data , and @xmath61 from the off - resonance data .    to measure the energy spectrum we reconstruct @xmath0 candidates in z intervals .",
    "we choose the z steps as 0.1 .",
    "the invariant mass spectra are fit with the same functional form as used for fig .",
    "[ fig : xm1sa ] . here",
    "we fix the mass of the @xmath0 to our average value over all z ; the monte carlo simulation shows that the mass measurement should be independent of @xmath0 energy .",
    "we extract the width of the signal gaussian distribution from monte carlo simulation for each z bin and perform a smooth fit as a function of z. the smoothed values are used in the fit as fixed parameters .",
    "the @xmath59 z dependent mass spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xm1sz ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : xm4sz ] for @xmath39 and off - resonance data , respectively .    in order to extract decay rates we need to correct our raw event yields by efficiencies .",
    "these may not be equal for different intermediate states , i.e. @xmath62 versus @xmath42 .",
    "the hadronic events at @xmath39 energy arise from different sources : about 4 nb is @xmath62 from continuum @xmath63 collisions , about 2 nb from @xmath43 , 18 nb from @xmath42 , and 0.5 nb from @xmath64 from the @xmath39 .",
    "the first two have same event topology and reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "we use the @xmath62 monte carlo generator to simulate these events .",
    "the @xmath64 events are similar to that of @xmath42 and have a relatively small cross - section ; thus we treat them the same way as @xmath42 events .",
    "we use the @xmath42 monte carlo generator to simulate this part .",
    "we rely on off - resonance continuum data to estimate the @xmath62 contribution in @xmath39 data .",
    "however , the continuum data were taken for continuum subtraction in @xmath41 studies .",
    "the center of mass ( cm ) energy ( 10.52 gev ) is close to @xmath41 mass ( 10.58 gev ) , but more than 1 gev higher than @xmath39 mass ( 9.46 gev ) .",
    "the difference of reconstruction efficiency due to this energy difference is not negligible .",
    "we thus use different @xmath62 simulations for continuum data and @xmath39 data .",
    "the energy difference also affects the z spectrum of @xmath0 from continuum monte carlo as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : znew]-(a ) .",
    "the solid line is the @xmath65 distribution for the @xmath25 data ( 9.46 gev ) and dashed line for the continuum data ( 10.52 gev ) .",
    "the low limits are 0.202 and 0.182 respectively .",
    "the discrepancy is significant , especially at low energy . in order to use our continuum data at 10.52 gev",
    "we need to map it to 9.46 gev .",
    "to do so we rely on the continuum monte carlo .",
    "we take the two monte carlo @xmath0 shape distributions at 10.52 and 9.46 gev , denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath67 and numerically integrate them to satisfy the relation : @xmath68 where z@xmath69 is fixed and a value for z@xmath70 is determined .",
    "the data points on fig .",
    "[ fig : znew]-(b ) show the difference in z@xmath71z@xmath69 as a function of z@xmath69 ( or equivalently @xmath72 in following function ) .",
    "we fit the points with a fourth order polynomial function to define the mapping analytically as @xmath73 the simplest mapping would be a linear conversion @xmath74 , shown as dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : znew]-(b ) .",
    "we use this alternative to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the mapping .    that this mapping works is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : znew]-(a ) , where the spectra shown as open circles is the mapped spectrum according to equation  [ eq : z ] .",
    "it overlaps well with the monte carlo spectrum generated at 9.46 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 production rate is smaller at 9.46 gev because of less available energy . from the @xmath62 generator we found that the production rate is 93.6% that of 10.52 gev .",
    "this factor is also considered in estimation of the @xmath0 production from @xmath62 events .",
    "the mapping for continuum data is derived from the model - dependent monte carlo spectrum .",
    "if the real data and the monte carlo are very different then the systematic uncertainty due to this mapping could be large . to check this , we compared the measured @xmath75 spectrum with the generated spectrum . fortunately , the spectra agree reasonably well and the systematic uncertainty due to this source is negligible .",
    "we now turn to estimating the detection efficiencies . shown in fig .",

    "the efficiency from @xmath42 events is roughly 15% higher , and the efficiency from 10.52 gev @xmath62 events is roughly 7% lower .",
    "the main source of such difference is the event shape .",
    "the @xmath42 events are more spherical while the higher energy @xmath62 events are more jetty .",
    "the @xmath39 data sample can be broken down into three parts as described in the previous section : @xmath77 the first one has different reconstruction efficiencies from the other two . for the contribution from continuum @xmath78 ) events , we multiply the number from off - resonance events at 10.52 gev , mapped using equation  [ eq : z ] , by a factor @xmath79 defined as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 where the first factor is the relative luminosities , the second the energy squared dependence of the cross section , the third the relative @xmath0 yield and @xmath82 is the @xmath83-dependent reconstruction efficiency for @xmath62 events as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : eff ] .",
    "we also want to evaluate the yield from @xmath84 .",
    "since we know that @xmath85 and @xmath86  @xcite , we derive the factor to be used in the @xmath87 estimation as : @xmath88    in table  [ tab : nrecon ] we list the number of reconstructed @xmath0 over all @xmath83 and in the high @xmath83 region for various @xmath39 and continuum yields ( only statistical errors are shown ) .",
    "note that the total numbers of signal from @xmath39 data and off - resonance data in this table are the sum of all @xmath83 bins derived bin per bin , as we need to use @xmath83-dependent efficiencies .",

    "however , a detailed study did not reveal any narrow structures .",
    "a possible explanation is that there is more than one process contributing to this distribution .",

    "[ fig : spec ] shows the z spectrum of the @xmath0 measured in this paper compared with the spectra predicted by the three different models described above .",

    "we have made the first measurement of the @xmath0 energy spectrum from @xmath26 decays .",
    "our data are not consistent with an enhanced @xmath2 coupling at large @xmath0 energies .",
