    "one of the outstanding characteristics of dark cloud cores , which are formation sites of low - mass stars , is high abundances of carbon - chain molecules .",
    "@xcite carried out survey observations of ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 toward 49 dense cores , and found that the abundance of ccs is anticorrelated with that of nh@xmath0 , which is interpreted in terms of chemical evolution of dark cloud cores ; ccs and nh@xmath0 are abundant in early and late stages of chemical evolution , respectively @xcite .",
    "similar survey observations were carried out for dense molecular cloud cores @xcite , bok globules and herbig ae / be stars @xcite , translucent clouds @xcite , low - mass young stellar objects associated with h@xmath3o masers @xcite , and infrared dark clouds @xcite , as well as individual clouds such as the pipe nebula @xcite , the perseus molecular cloud @xcite , and the orion molecular cloud @xcite , revealing a relationship between physical and chemical evolutionary stages of molecular cloud cores .",
    "a number of detailed studies on the dark cloud cores using the ccs lines were also conducted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results clearly demonstrated that the distribution of ccs is anticorrelated with those of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 .",
    "in particular , dynamically evolved cores such as l1498 and l1544 , which are gravitationally infalling in the central part of the cores , show a donut - like distribution of ccs due to its depletion in gas phase , while the nh@xmath0 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 distributions are centrally condensed @xcite .",
    "such a chemically differentiated feature is successfully interpreted in terms of chemical and dynamical evolution of dark cloud cores through recent detailed theoretical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the ccs survey by @xcite , four",
    "`` carbon - chain  producing regions '' ( ccprs ) were identified : l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 . in ccprs ,",
    "the ccs and other carbon - chain molecules are extremely abundant while nh@xmath0 is deficient , suggesting that they are chemically less evolved @xcite .",
    "recent comprehensive observational studies on ccprs revealed that they are dynamically younger than other starless cores @xcite .",
    "thus , detailed studies on such sources are of great importance to understand initial conditions of low - mass star formation processes",
    ".    however , only four ccprs have been identified to date , all of which are in the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "this is partly because most of the previous studies on dark cloud cores were based on the survey of the nh@xmath0 lines @xcite and the samples were primarily chosen from the nh@xmath0 cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to establish the chemical evolutionary scheme of dark cloud cores on a statistical basis , we need to know how frequently ccprs show up .    with this in mind , we carried out a survey of the ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines toward dark cloud cores where the nh@xmath0 lines are weak , not detected , or not observed in the previous surveys , considering that the abundances of carbon - chain molecules are anticorrelated with that of nh@xmath0 @xcite . as a result",
    ", we found a new candidate for a ccpr , l492 in the aquila rift , whose details were already published @xcite . in addition , we have reanalyzed previous observations of the ccs and nh@xmath0 lines , part of which were published ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all the data are used for the statistical analysis of the chemical evolution of dark cloud cores .",
    "although our study is not based on unbiased survey observations , it would be useful to establish the chemical evolutionary scenario .",
    "observations were conducted with the 45 m radio telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) in 2002 march and 2004 april .",
    "the observed lines are summarized in table [ tab - obsedf ] .",
    "the ccs ( @xmath5=4@xmath0 - 3@xmath3 ) , hc@xmath0n ( @xmath6=5 - 4 ) , and hc@xmath1n ( @xmath6=17 - 16 ) lines in the 45 ghz region were simultaneously observed with an sis mixer receiver whose system temperature was 200 - 300 k. the main - beam efficiency ( @xmath7 ) and the half - power beam width were 0.7 and 37 , respectively . in addition , we observed the ccs and nh@xmath0 lines in the 22 - 23 ghz region toward selected sources , l1400b , l1517d , l492 , l429 - 2 , l483 , l530d , l1147 , and l1172b , in order to search for nh@xmath0 toward the ccs peak .",
    "these lines were observed simultaneously with a hemt receiver whose system temperature was about 200 k. the main - beam efficiency and the beam size were 0.8 and 74 , respectively .",
    "acousto - optical radio spectrometers with the frequency resolution of 37 khz were used as the backend .",
    "pointing was checked by observing nearby sio maser sources every two hours , and the pointing accuracy was estimated to be better than 5rms .",
    "observations in 2002 march were performed with the position - switching mode with the off position of 10  in the azimuth direction .",
    "on the other hand , the frequency - switching mode was employed for the observations in 2004 april , with the frequency throw of 0.4  mhz for the off - signal spectrum .",
    "observed sources are summarized in table [ tab - source ] .",
    "we selected these sources mainly from the list of the nh@xmath0 survey by @xcite , where the nh@xmath0 lines are not detected or not intense in spite of the existence of a dense core traced by the c@xmath8o line @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we selected the sources where the nh@xmath0 lines were not observed by @xcite , whereas the cs lines were detected @xcite . in total , we observed 32 dark cloud cores , among which five sources contain _ iras _ point sources and the others are starless .",
    "they include five sources , l1523 , l183(n ) , l1719b , b68 , and l483 where the ccs lines were previously observed @xcite .",
    "two sources , l1495c and l1172d , were later identified to be previously known sources , l1495n and l1172a , respectively .    for most of the sources",
    ", we made five - point mapping observations around the reference positions , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( + 80 , + 80 ) , ( + 80 , -80 ) , ( -80 , + 80 ) , and ( -80 , -80 ) , in order not to miss the spectral lines , because the peak position of the core might often be shifted from the reference position by more than the beam size of 37 . for cores where at least one of the lines was detected at any position , we further searched for the positions with stronger intensity with a grid spacing of 40 .",
    "an example of the profile map obtained is shown in figure [ fig - profile ] .",
    "it should be noted that cores smaller than about 80  in diameter might be missed from detection in our observations due to the coarse - sampling observations .",
    "in addition , we analyzed results of our previous survey of ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n toward eight sources , l1527 , l1512 , l183(s ) , l1696a , l1689n , l1157 , l1155c , and l1228 , as listed in table [ tab - source - app ] .",
    "for these sources , the results for ccs were reported by @xcite .",
    "observations were made in 1998 and 1999 with the 45 m radio telescope at nro .",
    "details of the observations were similar to those of the sessions in 2002 and 2004 .",
    "however , we observed these sources only toward the reference positions , except for l1512 where we carried out mapping observations of ccs and hc@xmath0n .",
    "we observed the ccs and hc@xmath0n lines toward all of the eight sources while hc@xmath1n was observed only toward l1527 .    in total",
    ", we finally obtained 40 samples of dark cloud cores both with and without the _ iras _ point sources .",
    "examples of the observed spectra are shown in figures [ fig - l483 ] and [ fig - sp ] .",
    "we detected both the ccs and hc@xmath0n lines toward 17 out of 40 samples , and detected the hc@xmath1n lines toward five sources out of 35 samples . among our sources , detection of the nh@xmath0 lines was reported for 24 sources out of 39 sources , mainly by @xcite and the present study .",
    "all of these detections indicate that there exist dense cores with the h@xmath3 densities of the order of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", none of the ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 lines were detected toward 14 out of our 40 samples probably due to insufficient sensitivity of our observations , and/or positional offset from the intensity peak .",
    "some of these cores might have densities less than the critical densities of the observed lines , @xmath11  @xmath10 .",
    "a few of them show intense spectra of carbon - chain molecules .",
    "in particular , we found remarkably intense spectra of ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines toward l492 .",
    "brightness temperatures of these lines toward l492 were comparable to those toward the known ccprs such as l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this result strongly suggests that l492 would be extremely rich in carbon - chain molecules , which was confirmed by follow - up observations @xcite .      for all of the detected lines , peak antenna temperature , line width , and lsr velocity",
    "are derived by fitting the gaussian profile to each spectrum , which are summarized in table [ tab - obsccs ] . for the nh@xmath0 lines toward l429 - 1 and l483",
    ", we derived the lsr velocities and the line widths assuming that they are common for all the hyperfine components . because of the insufficient spectral resolution of 37 khz , which is larger than most of the hyperfine splittings due to the h nuclei in the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) line , we fitted only the five major spectral components as labeled in table [ tab - obsedf ] @xcite .",
    "the line widths and lsr velocities are slightly different from molecule to molecule for some sources .",
    "this is partly due to the hyperfine structure of the hc@xmath0n and nh@xmath0 lines , whose line widths tend to be broader than those of the other molecules .    using these line parameters , column densities of ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0",
    "were calculated by the similar method described by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we calculated column densities of nh@xmath0 for cores that we did not observe , using the results of @xcite if they are available .",
    "the dipole moments of ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 were assumed to be 2.81 , 3.72 , 4.33 , and 1.46 debye , respectively @xcite . the lte condition was assumed , and the excitation temperatures were fixed to 5  k for ccs and 6.5  k for hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 . in this paper , we do not use the results of @xmath5=@xmath12-@xmath13 lines of ccs , because the beam size at the 22 ghz band , 74 , is almost comparable to the typical size of the observed dark cloud cores as shown in figure [ fig - maps ] , and the derived column densities may be affected due to the unknown source coupling efficiency .",
    "the derived column densities are summarized in table [ tab - collte ] . for l492 ,",
    "line parameters and column densities are taken from @xcite .",
    "calculated optical depths,@xmath14 , of the observed lines were 0.17 - 3.4 , 0.07 - 8.8 , and 0.15 - 0.65 for the ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines , respectively .",
    "the ccs and hc@xmath1n lines were found to be optically thin ( @xmath15 ) , except for the ccs line toward l492 ( @xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the hc@xmath0n lines are optically thick toward l1527 ( @xmath17 ) , l1512 ( @xmath18 ) , b68 ( @xmath19 ) , l492 ( @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and l483 ( @xmath18 ) . for l492",
    ", the optical depth and excitation temperatures were derived from the intensity ratio of the hyperfine components of the hc@xmath0n line @xcite .    in order to estimate uncertainties in the derived column densities , we calculated the column densities of ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n by varying the assumed excitation temperature of @xmath211  k. we found that the uncertainties in the derived column densities were typically 10%-30% .",
    "in addition , we compared column densities of some of the sources where the ccs lines were observed previously .",
    "we found that the column densities of ccs toward these sources differ by a factor of 0.4 - 3 mostly due to the difference in the observed positions , as in the case of l1512 and b68 , for instance . considering these results",
    ", we estimate that the uncertainties in the derived molecular column densities are typically about 30%-40% , while it could be as high as a factor of 3 in the worst case .      for several sources where the ccs and hc@xmath0n lines are intense",
    ", we obtained integrated intensity maps as shown in figure [ fig - maps ] .",
    "detailed descriptions for individual sources are summarized in appendix [ sec - individual ] .",
    "the ccs and hc@xmath0n maps show similar morphology @xcite , although some of them show slight differences in their sizes and peak positions .",
    "it is well known that ccs and some carbon - chain molecules are depleted at the central part of a starless dense core , and their distributions show a central hole @xcite .",
    "we can see such an apparent hole only in the ccs map of l1172d , possibly due to the lack of significant depletion of ccs and hc@xmath0n in other mapped sources .",
    "however , it is also likely that we could not trace such a small structure in the cores because of the large beam size and the coarse grid spacing of our mapping observations , 40 , which are comparable to or slightly larger than the expected size of the hole .",
    "in fact , the central hole of ccs in b335 was not detected by the single dish observation , but was first imaged by the interferometric observation using the vla @xcite with the spatial resolution of 12 .",
    "further high - resolution observations would settle this issue .",
    "in the present survey , we observed the ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines toward 40 dark cloud cores , and found several dense cores with high column densities of carbon - chain molecules and/or extremely low nh@xmath0/ccs ratios . here",
    "we tentatively define the ccpr as the core with the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio of less than 10 , which can easily be distinguished from other cores in table [ tab - collte ] and figure [ fig - nh3ccs ] as discussed later .",
    "based on this criterion , we can identify five new candidates for ccprs , l492 , l1517d , l530d , l1147 , and the northeast clump of l1172b , as well as four known ccprs , l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 @xcite . as briefly described in the appendix [ sec - individual ] , the chemical compositions of the newly found sources show a mutual variation , and are different from originally identified ccprs . here",
    "we classify the newly found candidates into two groups and summarize their properties below .",
    "one of the most outstanding source is l492 , where the carbon - chain molecules have high column densities comparable to the known ccprs .",
    "the high abundances of carbon - chain molecules , the lack of significant depletion , and low deuterium fractionation all suggest chemically less evolved nature of l492 ( * ? ? ? * and appendix [ sec - l492 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the other ccprs , the nh@xmath0 lines are also detected in l492 with moderate intensities .",
    "furthermore , l492 is thought to be dynamically evolved according to a strong infalling signature found in the spectral lines @xcite .",
    "detailed discussions in @xcite concluded that l492 is chemically and dynamically evolved than other ccprs , while younger than prestellar cores such as l1498 and l1544 @xcite .",
    "this order does not always mean the absolute age , because timescales of contraction , gas phase chemistry , and depletion would be different from source to source .",
    "the other group of the sources with remarkably low nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are the starless cores l1517d , l530d , and l1147 , as well as the northeast clump of l1172b . in these sources ,",
    "the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are comparable to those of other known ccprs , although column densities of both of ccs and nh@xmath0 are generally lower than the known ccprs as can be seen in table [ tab - collte ] .",
    "therefore , they are possible candidates for ccprs . in the case of l1147 , the weak nh@xmath0 line is detected toward the dust continuum peak , and the ccs peak coincides with the same position ( see appendix [ sec - l1147 ] ) , which results in the low nh@xmath0/ccs ratio toward the central part of the dense core as in the case of l492 .",
    "however , the column densities of both ccs and nh@xmath0 in l1147 are one order of magnitude lower than those of l492 .",
    "because the dust continuum emission of l1147 is weaker than the other cores @xcite , it is also likely that the column density of h@xmath3 is also less than l492 . on the other hand , in l1517d and l530d ,",
    "the peak positions of ccs are located at the edge of dense cores , which would be a reason for the lower column densities of the observed molecules ( see appendices [ sec - l1517d ] and [ sec - l530d ] ) .",
    "therefore , it can not be ruled out the possibility that the ccs line in l1517d and l530d would trace the outer part of the dense core , as can be seen in l1498 and l1544 @xcite . for l1172b ,",
    "dust continuum maps are not available in our knowledge , and hence , we will not discuss further the relationships between the ccs , hc@xmath0n , nh@xmath0 , and dust continuum emission ( see appendix [ sec - l1172b ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "l492 has been confirmed as a definitive ccpr that is found for the first time outside the taurus molecular cloud , and the others are possible candidates for ccprs , for which further high resolution mapping observations of carbon - chain molecules and nh@xmath0 , together with the dust continuum emission , are necessary for confirmation .      according to our results , overall detection rates of the observed molecular lines",
    "are 43% ( 17/40 ) , 43% ( 17/40 ) , 14%(5/35 ) , and 62%(24/39 ) for ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 , respectively , which are slightly lower than those of @xcite , 55% , 67% , 31% , and 80% , respectively , as listed in table [ tab - detection ] . although we selectively observed the cores with low abundance of nh@xmath0 , based on the anticorrelation between carbon - chain molecules and nh@xmath0 @xcite , the detection rates of carbon - chain molecules are not so high as expected .",
    "most of the observed cores with weak nh@xmath0 emission , except for five newly found candidates as mentioned in the previous section , are turned out to have `` normal '' nh@xmath0/ccs ratios and hence , would be just low column density objects . as mentioned previously , none of the observed lines were detected toward some of our samples probably due to offsets from the real emission peak . otherwise , they would have less densities so that the nh@xmath0 lines along with those of carbon - chain molecules are hardly excited .",
    "these results mean that the ccprs are intrinsically rare even in the taurus region where four ccprs have already been identified .    as discussed in the previous section , we calculated the column densities of ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 by the similar method described by @xcite .",
    "this enables us to discuss statistically about the carbon - chain chemistry in dark cloud cores by combining our results with those of previous surveys @xcite supplemented with several individual observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which were made by almost the same method of observations and data analysis .",
    "details of our samples are discussed in the appendix [ sec - appendall ] .",
    "we compiled a sample of nearby dark cloud cores consisting of 90 sources in total for the further statistical studies .",
    "the total detection rates are 53% , 55% , 23% , and 74% for ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath1n , and nh@xmath0 , respectively .    as noted in the introduction , the ccprs have so far been detected only in the taurus molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "this result would suggest a difference in the overall chemical compositions from cloud to cloud .",
    "hence , it is worthy to compare the detection rates of carbon - chain molecules between the taurus and other regions in order to investigate whether such a chemical abundance variation occurs . because the numbers of available samples are sufficient only for the taurus and ophiuchus cores ( @xmath2230 each ) , we here summarize the results for these two regions in table [ tab - detection ] .",
    "it is easily found that the detection rates of carbon - chain molecules are significantly lower in the ophiuchus cores than in the taurus cores .",
    "a ratio of the number of the ccs cores relative to that of the nh@xmath0 cores in the taurus region is three times higher than that of the ophiuchus region , as listed in table [ tab - detection ] .",
    "since our sample was not prepared in an unbiased way , these results are not statistical in a strict sense .",
    "nevertheless , we can extract ` statistical ' trends from the results because the sample involves a number of sources with and without star - forming activities .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that carbon - chain molecules are generally less abundant in the ophiuchus cores than in the taurus cores .",
    "we also compared our results with those of recent complete survey of ccs and nh@xmath0 in the pipe nebula @xcite and the perseus molecular cloud @xcite , as listed in table [ tab - detection ] .",
    "detection rates of the observed molecules are different from region to region . in the pipe nebula ,",
    "the detection rate of ccs is lower than that in the taurus region and is comparable to that in the ophiuchus region , while the detection rate of nh@xmath0 is almost the same as those in the other regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection rate of ccs in the perseus region is rather close to that in the taurus region , and the detection rate of nh@xmath0 in the perseus region is the highest among our four sampled regions .",
    "although the methods of the surveys are different from ours in various ways , such as observed transitions , sensitivities , spectral and spatial resolutions , methods of data analysis , and definition of star formation activities ( association of _ iras _ and/or _ spitzer _ sources ) , the possible difference in the ratio of the number of the ccs cores relative to that of the nh@xmath0 cores can be seen in table [ tab - detection ] ; the ratio in the taurus region ( 90% ) is nearly 3 , 2 , and 1.5 times higher than that in the ophiuchus region , the pipe nebula , and the perseus region , respectively , which would be indicative of difference in an average chemical age of cores in each region , as discussed later @xcite .      in order to investigate a source - to - source variation in molecular abundances ,",
    "we focus on the abundance ratio of nh@xmath0/ccs , which is recognized as a useful probe of the chemical evolutionary stage of dark cloud cores @xcite .",
    "following the discussion by @xcite , we investigate the relationship between the ccs abundance and the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio in figure [ fig - nh3ccs ] .",
    "we plotted the sources where either the ccs or nh@xmath0 line is detected ( table [ tab - summary ] ) . because of the lack of a complete data set for the column densities of h@xmath3 for all the cores , we plot the column densities of ccs instead of the fractional abundance of ccs relative to h@xmath3",
    "therefore , a scatter in the column density of ccs is not only due to the variation in the fractional abundance of ccs relative to h@xmath3 , but is also attributed to the difference in the column density of h@xmath3 .    in figure",
    "[ fig - nh3ccs ] , we can find ccprs ( l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 , and l492 ) at the upper - left part , and the ccpr candidates ( l1517d , l530d , l1147 , and the ( -40 , -40 ) and ( + 40 , + 40 ) positions in l1172b ) at the middle - left part .",
    "we stress that there is no carbon - chain - rich cores in the ophiuchus region as depicted in figure [ fig - nh3ccs](d ) , even though we have almost the same number of samples as in the taurus region .",
    "such a systematic abundance variation from cloud to cloud has been found in the deuterium fractionation ratios of dnc / hn@xmath23c @xcite and n@xmath3d@xmath4/n@xmath3h@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we again refer to the results of the pipe nebula @xcite and the perseus molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "it can be found that there is no carbon - chain - rich core in the perseus region in spite of the completeness of their survey , as shown in figure [ fig - nh3ccs - p ] . on the other hand ,",
    "we find several candidates for ccprs in the pipe nebula @xcite , where the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are less than 10 . in the pipe nebula",
    ", there exists a dense core ( core 37 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the ccs line is detected while nh@xmath0 is not . because of the lack of the nh@xmath0 data , it is not plotted in figure [ fig - nh3ccs - p](b ) .",
    "the column density of ccs toward this core is derived to be 2.0@xmath2410@xmath25  @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "although this value is much lower than those of the known ccprs , it would be a possible candidate of a ccpr .",
    "this result would suggest that the cores in the pipe nebula are generally in the early stages of both chemical and dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "although the above discussions are not based on unbiased , complete , and uniform surveys , the apparent region - to - region variation of the chemical composition would be indicative of difference in chemical and/or physical properties of each region .",
    "in fact , chemical and dynamical model calculations demonstrate that molecular abundances and distributions could reflect the physical properties and their initial conditions of the cores such as the density , degree of depletion , and velocity structure of the cores @xcite .",
    "observational evidences for the variations of physical properties are reported by @xcite based on the database of a survey of the nh@xmath0 lines .",
    "such a variation of the core properties would affect not only chemistry but also star - formation processes , which results in either isolated or clustered mode , and low - mass or high - mass star - formation .      in the above sections , we recognize significant source - to - source chemical abundance variation , in particular between the taurus and ophiuchus regions .",
    "here we discuss two possible scenarios which can explain qualitatively the systematic difference in the molecular abundances between the taurus cores and ophiuchus ones .",
    "most simply , the difference in the chemical abundances between the taurus and ophiuchus regions can be interpreted in terms of the different age of the taurus molecular cloud complex itself from that of ophiuchus . due to its younger chemical evolutionary stage of the taurus region",
    "than in ophiuchus , more young cores which have been just formed in the cloud complex could still remain in the taurus region than in ophiuchus .",
    "one would think that if ccprs are the precursors of the normal dense cores , the fraction of ccprs over normal cores would represent the duration or the age of the ccpr phase .",
    "such a statistical estimation is valid only for the taurus region because the number of both sample cores , ccprs and normal ones , are available only in this region . if we simply assume a typical lifetime of starless nh@xmath0 and/or ccs cores where the typical h@xmath3 density is an order of 10@xmath9  @xmath10 @xcite , to be ( 2 - 10)@xmath27  yr ( e.g. , figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ccpr phase would last no longer than @xmath22(0.4 - 2)@xmath27  yr .",
    "the lifetime is determined from the fraction of ccprs with respect to all the starless cores , 4/20 , in our sample .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the ratio of the duration of ccprs and other cores , @xmath28  yr and @xmath29  yr , respectively , estimated from a chemical model calculations and previous observational results @xcite .",
    "thus , our statistically estimated lifetime of the ccpr phase in the taurus cores is consistent with that of theoretical prediction .",
    "if stars as well as cores have been forming steadily at a constant rate in both the taurus and ophiuchus regions with the same evolutionary timescale , we would expect to detect three ccprs ( @xmath2220% ) among 15 starless cores in our ophiuchus sample ( table [ tab - detection ] ) .",
    "none detection of ccprs in the ophiuchus region would imply that there is no core younger than @xmath30  yr in ophiuchus , although we can not completely rule out the possibility of a selection bias .",
    "in other words , dense core formation in ophiuchus might have stopped since @xmath30  yr ago which results in a true deficient of ccprs in the ophiuchus region .",
    "a similar picture is proposed by @xcite on the basis of the fact that fraction of embedded young stellar objects is relatively lower in the ophiuchus region than in perseus .",
    "however , there still remains sufficient amount of molecular gas traced by the @xmath23co and c@xmath8o lines @xcite which have potential to form more dense cores , and hence , it seems unlikely that the dense core formation has stopped over @xmath30  yr .",
    "another possible scenario for the systematic molecular abundance variations is that the difference in the contraction timescale between the taurus cores and ophiuchus cores .",
    "the contraction timescale would reflect the physical properties such as average density , magnetic field strength and/or turbulence in / around the cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the detailed theoretical model calculations , behaviors of molecular abundances and their distributions are predicted to depend strongly on the timescale of the gravitational contraction ; the longer contraction time would result in the less abundances of carbon - chain molecules at the central part of the core @xcite .",
    "therefore , the systematically lower abundances of carbon - chain molecules in the ophiuchus cores could be accounted for by the slower contraction than in the taurus cores .",
    "previous works have shown that the star - formation activity in the ophiuchus region seems to be remarkably different from that in taurus .",
    "there exist an active cluster - forming region in ophiuchus triggered by a nearby scorpius ob association , while only isolated star - formation can be seen in taurus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , one would expect slower contraction timescale in the taurus region than in ophiuchus , which is exactly the opposite of what we are proposing in this section .",
    "however , active cluster - formation is localized only around `` the main body '' in the @xmath31-ophiuchus molecular cloud or a dark cloud l1688 , and rest of the region shows rather inactive star - formation @xcite .",
    "in fact , overall star - formation efficiency in the ophiuchus region , in particular ophiuchus north region , is lower than in taurus @xcite .",
    "based on the survey of the c@xmath8o line in the ophiuchus region , timescale of starless cores in the ophiuchus region is estimated to be 8@xmath2410@xmath32 yr , which is four times longer than that in taurus , 2@xmath2410@xmath32 yr @xcite .",
    "it is consistent with our hypothesis that the contraction timescale in taurus is generally shorter than in ophiuchus .",
    "this difference might be related to the difference in the line widths of the c@xmath8o lines which reflect turbulence of the cores ; mean line widths are 0.49 , 0.9 , and 0.7  km  s@xmath33 for the taurus , @xmath31-ophiuchus main body , and ophiuchus north regions , respectively @xcite .",
    "one might suppose that the difference in initial conditions can be an origin of chemical abundance variation .",
    "due to higher initial densities in the @xmath31-ophiuchus main body than in taurus @xcite , chemical evolution in the molecular cloud could occur prior to dense core formation in the @xmath31-ophiuchus main body . in this case",
    ", cores in the @xmath31-ophiuchus main body would be formed from already processed gas ( e.g. , higher nh@xmath0/ccs ratios ) , while taurus ones from more pristine material ( lower nh@xmath0/ccs ratio ) .",
    "this could produce the observed dichotomy without any need for a faster core contraction in taurus .",
    "higher initial density in the @xmath31-ophiuchus main body region would results in faster gravitational contraction than in taurus , giving a high star - formation rate .",
    "however , it is predicted that initial density of molecular cloud prior to the core formation ( @xmath34  @xmath10 ) would not much affect the molecular abundances in the dense core @xcite .",
    "therefore , we prefer the possible scenario of the faster contraction in the taurus regions than in ophiuchus rather than the difference in the initial densities .    in our samples , there are five cores which are embedded in the @xmath31-ophiuchus main body , l1681a , l1681b , l1690 , l1696a , and l1696b ( table [ tab - summary ] ) . among them , only l1681b and l1696a were detected in the nh@xmath0 line with normal nh@xmath0/ccs ratios while other cores were not detected probably due to the position offset from real core center .",
    "further complete survey of the ophiuchus cores ( e.g. , l1689b observed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is still an important issue to shed light on chemical and dynamical timescale of dense cores in this region .",
    "the difference in timescale of evolution of dense cores and young stellar objects is also proposed by @xcite based on the comparison of young stellar objects and dense cores in the ophiuchus and perseus regions .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare statistically physics and chemistry of dense cores and young stellar objects between taurus and ophiuchus regions .",
    "the difference in the contraction timescale is also reflected in the molecular distributions of ccs and nh@xmath0 in the observed cores . in general , depletion of molecules at the central part of the core is more significant for the slower contraction case , and hence , the size of the central hole of the distribution of ccs becomes larger @xcite .",
    "in contrast , cores with fast contraction show centrally condensed distribution of ccs without significant depletion @xcite .",
    "for instance , a chemical and dynamical model with a faster contraction is preferable for l1521e , one of the ccprs , @xcite judging from its central density , chemical composition along with no signature of depletion , and slightly broader line width than in other prestellar cores . in our mapping observations ,",
    "ccs distributions in two carbon - chain rich cores in the aquila region , l492 and l483 , are found to be centrally peaked structure .",
    "the contraction timescales of the l492 and l483 cores would have been short although they are dynamically evolved ; l492 is in the dynamically collapsing @xcite and l483 has already formed class 0 protostar @xcite .",
    "they may be even shorter than those of the taurus cores considering the possible difference in the chemical and dynamical evolutionary stages of the cores between the aquila rift and the taurus region , as suggested by @xcite .    in order to clarify the difference in the evolutionary timescale and/or age between the aquila region and the taurus region ,",
    "it is crucial to observe the distribution of ccs in l492 and l483 , as well as the known ccprs in the taurus molecular cloud , with the higher resolution interferometers .",
    "such observations would enable us to confirm whether there are really no central holes of ccs in these cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although it is difficult to infer the timescale or the age of each core quantitatively , our results would provide some hints to understand the timescale of the formation and evolution of dark cloud cores .      finally",
    ", we comment on warm carbon - chain chemistry ( wccc ) recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the wccc is first identified in l1527 and is characterized by high abundances of long carbon - chain molecules such as c@xmath35h ( @xmath36=4,5,6 ) and c@xmath35h@xmath3 ( @xmath36=3,4,6 ) , and intense spectra of higher excitation lines of carbon - chain molecules . according to these criteria ,",
    "l483 is considered to be a possible candidate of the wccc source . when it is compared with l1527 ,",
    "the both are associated with the _ iras _ point source , and the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are relatively high due to high nh@xmath0 column density .",
    "the abundances of hc@xmath0n are remarkably high and are comparable to those of ccprs such as l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 , and l492 . furthermore , we stress that l483 and l1527 show stronger emission of longer carbon - chain molecule hc@xmath1n than those in ccprs .",
    "except for relatively high abundance of ccs , chemistry in l483 seems to be quite similar to that in l1527 .",
    "observational studies of wccc have just been started , and hence , the reason for such similarities and differences will be investigated in the near future @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the regions where the wccc sources are found , taurus ( l1527 ) and aquila ( l483 ) , include ccprs such as l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 , and l492 . on the other hand ,",
    "no wccc sources are found currently in the ophiuchus and perseus regions @xcite .",
    "although the discussion is based on a limited number of samples at this moment , the wccc might have a close connection to the ccprs .",
    "therefore , chemistry of carbon - chain molecules would be indicative of difference in the physical and chemical properties among molecular cloud complexes .",
    "in the present study , we carried out survey observations of ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n toward 40 dark cloud cores in total using the 45  m radio telescope of the nro .",
    "based on the previous result that the spectra of carbon - chain molecules tend to be intense toward the cores where the nh@xmath0 lines are weak @xcite , we primarily observed the dense cores where the nh@xmath0 lines are weak , not detected , or not observed previously .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we detected the ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines for the 17 , 17 , and 5 cores out of the 40 , 40 , and 35 cores observed , respectively . according to the previous survey of nh@xmath0 conducted by @xcite , the nh@xmath0 lines are detected toward 24 cores out of our 40 cores .",
    "the detection rates of the ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines are lower than those of previous survey @xcite , although the spectra of carbon - chain molecules had been expected to be intense toward the cores with weak or no nh@xmath0 lines . 2 .   among the 40 cores of our survey",
    ", we found remarkably intense spectra of ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n toward a starless dense core l492 in the aquila rift .",
    "we have carried out follow - up observations of l492 and found that this source is chemically less evolved dark cloud core like ccprs .",
    "3 .   in addition",
    ", we found possible candidates for ccprs , where the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are as low as other known ccprs : l1517d , l530d , l1147 , and l1172b .",
    "further confirmation observations are needed for these sources .",
    "4 .   together with the present results",
    ", we compiled available results of the survey of carbon - chain molecules and nh@xmath0 to investigate the variation of the molecular abundances in the observed samples .",
    "we found that the abundance ratios of carbon - chain molecules and nh@xmath0 , in particular the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio , which is a good indicator of chemical evolutionary stage of dark cloud cores , tend to be higher in the ophiuchus cores than in the taurus region .",
    "the systematic variation can be seen in the detection rates of carbon - chain molecules .",
    "for instance , the detection rates of the ccs , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath1n lines are significantly higher in the taurus region than in the ophiuchus region , although the total number of samples , fraction of cores associated with _ iras _ sources , and the detection rate of the nh@xmath0 lines are similar to each other . 6 .",
    "these chemical abundance variation found in our study may suggest the region - to - region difference in the contraction timescale rather than the difference in the evolutionary stage alone , which could be indicative of some differences in the physical properties such as average density , magnetic field strength and/or turbulence in / around the cores .",
    "it is important but difficult to compare evolutionary timescale by the statistical discussion because the present study is not based on the unbiased survey .",
    "further complete and unbiased survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would be needed to understand low - mass star - formation processes in dark cloud cores both from the chemical and dynamical point of views .",
    "mapping observations of some tracers of chemical evolution such as carbon - chain molecules , nh@xmath0 , and deuterated molecules , and submillimeter continuum emission including polarization would also be important to reveal their dynamical and chemical evolutionary stage as proposed in several literatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , the column density of nh@xmath0 toward the dust continuum peak is derived to be 7.9@xmath2410@xmath23  @xmath26 from the data of @xcite , which results in the nh@xmath0/ccs ratio toward the dust continuum peak 10 times larger than that toward the ccs peak .",

    "<S> such a variation is also suggested by the detection rates of carbon - chain molecules . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the nh@xmath0/ccs ratios are higher and the detection rates of carbon - chain molecules are lower in the ophiuchus cores than in the taurus cores . </S>",
    "<S> an origin of these systematic abundance variation is discussed in terms of the difference in the evolutionary stage or the contraction timescale . </S>",
