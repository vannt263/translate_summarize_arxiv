    "nowadays several attempts have been devoted to construct analytical solutions of schrdinger equation associated with the bohr hamiltonian @xcite and various model potentials with the aim of describing appropriately shape phase transitions in atomic nuclei , particularly those which are related to the issue of critical point symmetries , namely : e(5 ) @xcite and x(5 ) @xcite .",
    "the first symmetry corresponds to transition from vibrational u(5 ) to @xmath0unstable nuclei o(6 ) , while the second one corresponds to transition from vibrational spherical shape u(5 ) to prolate deformed nuclei su(3 ) .",
    "besides , the symmetry e(5 ) @xcite represents a solution of the bohr hamiltonian with a potential assumed to be independent of the @xmath3 collective variable , while in the x(5 ) @xcite symmetry case the @xmath3 potential has a minimum at @xmath4 . in the framework of the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) model @xcite the o(6 ) group has been first introduced to explain spectrum of the @xmath3-unstable nucleus @xcite . the geometrical picture of the o(6 ) group has shown to emerge in the coherent state formalism of the ibm , giving similar @xmath3-flat potential energy surface to the collective model @xcite .",
    "caprio and iachello @xcite have extensively addressed the geometries of dynamical symmetries of ibm in relation to quantum phase transitions .",
    "very recently , a more realistic calculation on the @xmath3-softness has been presented within the ibm in connection to the microscopic potential energy surface @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to search for adequate solutions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors problem allowing better theoretical predictions for @xmath3-unstable and axially deformed nuclei . for this purpose , instead of the infinite square well potential used in the original works @xcite and x(5 ) @xcite we adopt the manning - rosen potential as used in @xcite for the @xmath2-part of the nuclear potential . while , the @xmath3-part is taken to be equal to the harmonic oscillator one in the case of prolate axially deformed nuclei .",
    "thus , by means of the asymptotic iteration method @xcite , we derive closed analytical expressions for the energy spectrum and the corresponding wave functions .",
    "similar works exist in the literature with other potentials like the coulomb @xcite , kratzer @xcite , harmonic oscillator @xcite , davidson @xcite and morse @xcite potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii the asymptotic iteration method is briefly described . in section iii , we achieved the exact separation of the bohr hamiltonian in @xmath3-unstable and prolate axial rotor case .",
    "excited - state wave functions are given in section iv , while the numerical calculations for energy spectra and comparisons with experimental data are presented in section v. finally , section vi contains our conclusion .",
    "as already mentioned , the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite has been proposed and applied @xcite to solve the second - order homogeneous differential equation of the form @xmath5 where the variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 are sufficiently differentiable with @xmath8 .",
    "the differential equation has a general solution @xmath9dx_2     \\big)dx_1\\big ] \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we have @xmath10 , for sufficiently large n , @xmath11 values can be obtained @xmath12 with @xmath13 this method consists of converting the schrdinger equation into the form of eq . for a given potential .",
    "then , @xmath14 s and @xmath15 s parameters are computed by means of the recurrences relations of eq . .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are then calculated by means of the following quantization condition @xcite @xmath16",
    "the original collective bohr hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath17+v(\\beta,\\gamma )    \\label{6}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual collective coordinates , @xmath18 are the components of angular momentum in the intrinsic frame , and @xmath19 is the mass parameter .      for @xmath0unstable structure case ,",
    "the potential energy is independent of @xmath3 , namely @xmath20 .",
    "the separation of variables is achieved by assuming a wave function of the form @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the euler angles .",
    "+ then the separation of the variables leads to a system of two differential equations , one containing only the @xmath2 variable , while the second contains the @xmath3 variable and the euler angles , @xmath23 : @xmath24\\xi(\\beta)=\\epsilon \\xi(\\beta )   \\label{8}\\ ] ] @xmath25\\phi(\\gamma,\\theta_i)\\\\=\\lambda\\phi(\\gamma,\\theta_i )   \\label{9}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the reduced energies and reduced potentials are defined as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 is the separation constant .",
    "+ the @xmath3 and euler angles equation has been solved by bs@xcite . in this equation ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the second - order casimir operator so(5 ) are expressed in the following form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the seniority quantum number , characterizing the irreducible representations of so(5 ) and taking the values @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the values of angular momentum l occurring for each @xmath30 are provided by a well known algorithm and are listed in @xcite .",
    "the ground state band levels are determined by @xmath32 . concerning the radial part , the rosen - manning potential @xmath33 where a unit depth @xcite is used @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a screening parameter characterizing the range of the potential and the parameter @xmath36 indicates the position of the minimum of the potential . for small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the manning - rosen potential reproduces exactly the kratzer potential @xcite with an additive constant .",
    "moreover , if we expand both potentials : manning - rosen and kratzer around the minimum of the potential @xmath36 , we get the harmonic - oscillator potential .    through the following transformation of the radial function @xmath37",
    ", the radial equation leads to : @xmath38\\chi(\\beta)=\\epsilon \\chi(\\beta )   \\label{11}\\ ] ] for @xmath39-wave ( @xmath400 states ) , the above equation can not be solved analytically .",
    "then , in order to obtain quasi - analytical solutions of , we need to employ greene - aldrich approximation @xcite to the centrifugal term similar to other authors @xcite , @xmath41 this approximation is valid only for small values of the screening parameter @xmath35 .    to solve eq . within aim",
    "@xcite , we consider the following ansatz for the function @xmath42 , with the new variable @xmath43 , @xmath44 with @xmath45 substituting the approximation and the function eq . into eq .",
    "we get @xmath46 the first and the second terms in the right hand side of the above equation represent the @xmath47 and @xmath48 functions of eq . respectively .",
    "we compute the @xmath15 and @xmath14 by the recurrence relations of equation . then , through the quantization condition of the method , given in eq .",
    "we obtain the generalized formula of the radial energy eigenvalues : @xmath49 \\label{16}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the principal quantum number and with : @xmath51      in this case , the reduced potential @xmath52 depends on the asymmetry @xmath3 .",
    "however , to achieve exact separation of variables , we assume a potential of the form @xcite @xmath53 for the @xmath3-potential , we use a harmonic oscillator @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a free parameter .    as the @xmath3 potential is minimal at @xmath4",

    "the radial wave function can be written as @xmath80 therefore , @xmath81 is obtained from the normalization condition : @xmath82 using the usual orthogonality relation of jacobi polynomials ( see eq .",
    "( 7.391.1 ) of @xcite ) we get @xmath83",
    "the obtained energy spectrum formulas eq . and",
    "eq . in both cases of @xmath3-unstable and axially symmetric deformed nuclei , respectively are applied to calculate excitation energies of nuclei with a mass number @xmath84 .",
    "as it is shown above in @xmath0unstable case , the energy spectrum depends on two free parameters ( @xmath85 ) while in the axially symmetric prolate deformed nuclei it depends on three free parameters ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "all these parameters have been fixed by fitting the excitation energies normalized to the energy of the first excited state @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig5 ] the manning - rosen potential has proved its ability to reproduce adequately the experimental energy spectrum of @xmath110u in comparison with the calculated spectrum with davison potential within the deformation dependent mass formalism ( ddmf ) @xcite bearing in mind that the ddmf @xcite introduces an extra fitting parameter which allows enhancing the precision of the numerical results , while our calculations have been carried out only with a constant mass parameter .",
