    "the search for explicit solutions of systems of first - order differential equations is not an easy task and there exist only few cases in which we can express in a compact way the form of the general solution .",
    "the determination of particular solutions can be very useful in the reduction of the original problem to a simpler one . in the simplest cases of linear systems the _ linear superposition principle _ plays a relevant rle and we are able to express the general solution as an arbitrary linear combination with real coefficients of a fundamental set of solutions .",
    "there are also cases of nonlinear ( systems of ) differential equations for which a nonlinear superposition rule does exist , the best known one being the riccati equation @xmath1 which is very often used in many fields of mathematics , control theory and theoretical physics ( see for instance and references therein ) and its importance in this field has been increasing since witten s introduction of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .    in fact , if three particular solutions of ( [ ricceq ] ) are known , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the general solution can be found from the cross ratio relation @xmath4 which provides us a nonlinear superposition rule : @xmath5    the general theory for nonlinear superposition rules was developed by lie @xcite and it has been more recently revisited from a geometric perspective .",
    "another nonlinear equation with relevance in physics is the today called milne  pinney equation : @xmath6 this equation is defined on @xmath7 and it is invariant under parity , i.e. if @xmath8 is a solution then @xmath9 is a solution too .",
    "that means that it is enough to restrict ourselves to the @xmath10 case .",
    "equation ( [ mpeq ] ) models many physical problems such as propagation of laser beams in nonlinear media , plasma dynamics , or the mean field dynamics for bose  einstein condensates through the so - called gross  pitaevskii equation .",
    "it was introduced by ermakov as a way for finding a first - integral of the corresponding time - dependent harmonic oscillator described by @xmath11 by means of the ermakov system @xcite made up by the two equations ( [ mpeq ] ) and ( [ tdfhoeq ] ) .",
    "this ermakov system admits the well - known ermakov invariant @xmath12 from where one can see that the general solution @xmath8 of milne  pinney equation can be expressed in terms of two solutions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the associated harmonic oscillator as follows @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wronskian of the two solutions of ( [ tdfhoeq ] ) , @xmath17 , which is constant , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are non - negative constants such that @xmath20 . in this way , as @xmath21 then @xmath22 and thus the solutions given by ( [ oldsr ] ) are real .    in a similar way",
    ", it has recently been shown in @xcite that there exists also a superposition rule involving three solutions of a related riccati equation for giving the general solution of ( [ mpeq ] ) .",
    "a generalisation of this ermakov system was proposed in : @xmath23 and a new invariant was obtained for this generalised ermakov system : @xmath24\\,du\\,.\\label{generminv}\\ ] ] this generalised ermakov system reduces to the standard one for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in this case ( [ generminv ] ) becomes ( [ erminv ] ) .",
    "our aim in this section is to show that there exists a superposition rule for the milne  pinney equation ( [ mpeq ] ) @xcite in terms of a pair of its particular solutions .",
    "in fact , one see from ( [ generminv ] ) that in the particular case of @xmath27 , if a particular solution @xmath28 is known , there is a @xmath29-dependent constant of motion for the milne  pinney equation given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath30\\,.\\ ] ]    if another particular solution @xmath31 of ( [ mpeq ] ) is given , then we have another @xmath29-dependent constant of motion @xmath32\\,.\\ ] ] moreover , the two solutions @xmath28 and @xmath31 provide us a function of @xmath29 which is constant and generalises the wronskian @xmath16 of two solutions of ( [ mpeq ] ) : @xmath33\\,.\\ ] ]    remark that for any real number @xmath34 the inequality @xmath35 implies @xmath36 and the equality sign is valid if and only if @xmath37 , @xmath38 therefore , as we have considered @xmath39 , we see that @xmath40 , for @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , as the solutions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are different solutions of the milne  pinney equation , it turns out that @xmath44 .",
    "the knowledge of the two constants of motion @xmath45 and @xmath46 , together with the constant value of @xmath47 for a pair of solutions of ( [ mpeq ] ) , can be used to obtain the superposition rule for such a differential equation .",
    "in fact , given two solutions @xmath28 and @xmath31 of ( [ mpeq ] ) , first the constant of motion ( [ c2 ] ) allows us to write an explicit expression for @xmath48 in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath46 : @xmath50 and using such expression in ( [ c1 ] ) we see after a careful computation that @xmath51 satisfies the following fourth degree equation @xmath52 where use has been made of the constant value of @xmath47 for two solutions of the milne  pinney equation .",
    "therefore , we can obtain from ( [ bicua ] ) the expression for the square of the solutions of ( [ mpeq ] ) in terms of any pair of its particular positive solutions by means of a superposition rule @xmath53},\\label{srxdos}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a constant which depends on @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath58 and the constant value of @xmath47 as follows : @xmath59 where the function @xmath60 is given by @xmath61    it is important to remark that if @xmath62 then @xmath63 and if @xmath64 then @xmath65 , i.e. if @xmath62 then @xmath66 , and thus @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 , and thus , as @xmath44 , @xmath63 .",

    "let @xmath108 denote the set @xmath109 and consider three cases :    1 .",

    "pinney equation and if no restriction were considered we would had obtained real and imaginary solutions for the real milne ",
    "pinney equation .",
    "expression ( [ sr ] ) provides us a ( as far as we know , new ) superposition rule for the positive solutions of the pinney equation ( [ mpeq ] ) in terms of two of its independent particular positive solutions .",
    "therefore , once two particular solutions of the equation ( [ mpeq ] ) are known , we can write its general solution .",
    "note also that , because of the parity symmetry of ( [ mpeq ] ) , the superposition ( [ sr ] ) can be used with positive and negative solutions . in all these ways",
    "we obtain if @xmath136 non - vanishing solutions of ( [ mpeq ] ) .",
    "it is also to be remarked that the same procedure as before can be repeated in the case @xmath137 to obtain similar results .    a similar superposition rule works for negative solutions of milne  pinney equation ( [ mpeq ] ) : @xmath138 where once again @xmath28 and @xmath31 are arbitrary solutions .",
    "we can now compare both superpositions rules ( [ oldsr ] ) and ( [ sr ] ) and check that actually the latter reduces to the former one when @xmath28 and @xmath31 are obtained from solutions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the associated harmonic oscillator equation .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be two solutions of ( [ tdfhoeq ] ) and @xmath16 its wronskian .",
    "consider the two particular positive solutions of the milne  pinney - equation @xmath42 and @xmath43 given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 and we additionally impose @xmath141    @xmath47 given by ( [ c3 ] ) for the two particular solutions of the milne",
    " pinney equation can then be expressed as a function of the solutions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the time - dependent harmonic oscillator and its wronskian @xmath16 .",
    "after a long computation @xmath47 turns out to be @xmath142 and then using the explicit form ( [ change ] ) of the particular solutions and taking into account ( [ i3 ] ) in ( [ sr ] ) we obtain that    @xmath143    consequently , from the superposition rule ( [ sr ] ) we recover expression ( [ oldsr ] ) : @xmath144 where now @xmath145 once we have stated the superposition rule we still have to analyse the possible values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 that we can use in this case .",
    "if we use the expression ( [ i3 ] ) we obtain after a short calculation the following values @xmath146 @xmath147 now if we write @xmath148 and @xmath149 in terms of @xmath150 and @xmath16 from the system ( [ change ] ) we obtain @xmath151    therefore , as @xmath152 the condition of being @xmath148 and @xmath153 being positive is @xmath154 and it is verified if @xmath155 and @xmath156 , because of ( [ addcond ] )",
    ". thus , @xmath121 and therefore the only restrictions for @xmath135 are @xmath123 and @xmath157 . obviously , by means of the change of variables ( [ change ] ) this last expression is equivalent to @xmath158 and thus @xmath159 and @xmath160 can not be simultaneously negative . furthermore , @xmath161 . as we have said that @xmath123 then @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath163 is positive and thus , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are positive . in this way we recover the usual constants of the known superposition rule of the milne ",
    "pinney equation in terms of solutions of an harmonic oscillator .",
    "as a particularly simple but interesting application , we can use the superposition rule ( [ sr ] ) for the milne  pinney equation in order to obtain the general solution of the constant unity frequency case : @xmath164    as indicated by pinney in @xcite , the superposition rule ( [ sr ] ) gives us the general solution in terms of solutions of the corresponding harmonic oscillator @xmath165    choosing two positive constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that @xmath166 and @xmath140 , we obtain the following two independent particular solutions of the pinney - equation : @xmath167 if we take , for instance , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , for which @xmath170 , the following solutions for the milne  pinney equation are obtained : @xmath171    we can use these two expressions in ( [ sr ] ) for obtaining the general solution of the milne  pinney equation .",
    "if we choose @xmath172 and @xmath173 then we obtain the general solution for the milne ",
    "pinney equation with constant frequency : @xmath174 obviously , as we said before , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are such that @xmath123 and @xmath157 .",
    "in summary , we have obtained a new superposition rule for the milne  pinney equation in terms of a set of two of its particular solutions .",
    "also , we have related the new superposition rule with the one proposed in @xcite for solutions of the related equation ( [ tdfhoeq ] ) . finally , a particular example in which we use this new superposition rule to obtain the general solution for the corresponding milne  pinney equation is given .",
    "another interesting question to be solved later on is why the obtained superposition rule for the milne  pinney equation and",
    "the already known one just depend on the variables @xmath28 and @xmath175 and not on the @xmath176 and @xmath177 variables as one would expect by the theory of lie systems . this fact is not an isolated result and can be found also in other superposition rules for second order differential equations , see @xcite .",
