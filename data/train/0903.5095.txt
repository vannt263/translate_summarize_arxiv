    "the large - scale features of the observed universe are strikingly consistent with the theoretical predictions based on the cold dark matter model",
    ". the combined analyses of the recent data from the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy power spectrum and type ia supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have been capable of measuring the key cosmological parameters that characterize the cdm model with surprisingly high precision . this has opened an era of precision cosmology , echoing the triumph of the cdm model .",
    "nevertheless , the status of the cdm model as the standard paradigm has been shaking currently in both observational and theoretical perspectives .",
    "observations have reported several mismatches between the predictions of the cdm model and the real phenomena on galactic and subgalactic scales .",
    "for instance , the abundance of galactic satellites , the slope of the inner core of the dark halo density profiles , and the degree of void emptiness have exhibited apparent conflicts between theory and observation @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite measured the cross - correlations between different galaxy s observables and showed that only a single parameter suffices to explain the complex structures of galaxies .",
    "this phenomenon is inconsistent with the cdm picture where the galaxy formation is driven by hierarchical merging process .",
    "although it is still inconclusive whether the reported mismatches really indicate the failure of the cdm model or they are just by - products of the selection effects and/or limitations of the observational techniques , it has certainly led to an emergence of alternative models .",
    "a theoretical challenge comes from the fact that the extension of the standard particle physics favors the warm dark matter ( wdm ) rather than cdm .",
    "the wdm differs from cdm in a respect that the wdm particles have non - negligible free streaming scale , @xmath3 . on scales larger than @xmath3 , wdm behave just like cdm . on the other hand , on scales less than @xmath3 , wdm do not cluster but free stream due to their large velocity dispersions unlike cdm which cluster on all scales .",
    "it is this property that enables the wdm model to overcome the observational mismatches faced by the cdm model .",
    "the list of realistic wdm candidates that have so far proposed includes gravitinos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , axions @xcite , and sterile neutrinos @xcite , each of which has distinct characteristic mass range .",
    "by constraining the wdm particle mass , it may be possible to rule out a certain wdm candidate .",
    "in fact there have been already such attempts : for instance , @xcite constrained the particle mass of wdm by using the ly@xmath4 forest power spectrum and suggested that the sterile neutrinos be ruled out ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in a wdm universe , the objects that will first condense out in the initial density inhomogeneities are not zero dimensional clumps but one dimensional filaments .",
    "@xcite recently studied the formation and properties of wdm filaments with high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations , and proposed that the early - universe filaments would seed the supermassive black holes that power the quasars at @xmath5 through their eventual collapse along the longest axes .",
    "if this scenario is true , then , the following two issues should be related to each other : how luminous and abundant the first generation high-@xmath1 quasars are ; and how massive and abundant the early - universe wdm filaments are . in statistical terms",
    ", the luminosity function of the high-@xmath1 quasars should be related to the mass function of the early - universe filaments .",
    "given that the mass function of the early - universe filaments depends on the particle mass of wdm ( see  2 ) , it implies the possibility of using the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function as a new wdm constraint .    the idealistic way to study the mass function of early - universe filaments and",
    "its dependence on the wdm particle mass is to use the hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "however , given the computational costs as well as the current resolution - limit of hydrodynamic simulations , it is adequate and quite necessary to consider an analytic approach as the first guideline . here , we evaluate analytically the abundance of early - universe filaments and constrain the wdm particle mass by fitting its slope in the wdm particle free streaming scale to that of the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function @xcite determined from the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( sdss ) @xcite . for the key cosmological parameters other than the wdm particle mass , we assume a wmap5 cosmology @xcite throughout this paper .    the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 , an analytic model for the abundance of early universe filaments is presented . in  3 , a constraint on the particle mass of wdm is provided by fitting the analytic model to the observational data from sdss . in  4 , the achievements as well as the caveats of our work are discussed .",
    "the zeldovich approximation predicts generically and in the most simple way the formation of early - universe filaments @xcite . according to this model",
    ", the mass density @xmath6 of a given region can be expressed in terms of the lagrangian quantities as @xmath7[1-d(z)\\lambda_2][1-d(z)\\lambda_3 ] } ,   \\label{eqn : rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the mean background density , @xmath9 ( in a decreasing order ) are the three eigenvalues of the linear deformation tensor , and @xmath10 is a linear growth factor .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : rho ] ) predicts that @xmath6 will diverge at @xmath11 .",
    "that is , the first collapse will occur when the largest eigenvalue reaches a threshold value , @xmath12 .",
    "the sign of the other two eigenvalues , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , at the moment of the first collapse will determine the dimension of a collapsed object .",
    "a one - dimensional filament will form if @xmath15 and @xmath16 , while the formation of a two - dimensional sheet will occur for the case @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "since we are interested in the formation of `` filaments '' that are shown to be most abundant in the early universe filled by wdm @xcite , we consider only the filament condition , @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the fractional volume @xmath18 occupied by those lagrangian regions which will condense out early - universe filaments at @xmath1 on mass scale @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the rms density fluctuation related to the dimensionless linear wdm power spectrum @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents a sharp k - space filter on mass scale @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt the approximation formula of@xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cdm linear power spectrum .",

    "* hereafter ps ) , we evaluate the number density of early - universe filaments collapsed at mass scale @xmath19 as @xmath37 where the redshift for the formation of the early - universe filaments is set at @xmath38 , in accordance with @xcite . in the original ps theory which dealt with the mass function of the clumps , equation ( [ eqn : nf ] )",
    "had to be multiplied by an additional normalization constant to account for the occurrence of the cloud - in - clouds @xcite .",
    "but , for our case the cloud - in - clouds will not occur since the wdm particles just free - stream in the early - universe filaments forming no substructures .",
    "henceforth , we do not have to account for the cloud - in - cloud problem in deriving the mass function of early universe filaments .    the cumulative mass function @xmath39 of early universe filaments",
    "can be obtained by integrating equation ( [ eqn : nf ] ) as @xmath40 . since",
    "our focus is not on the amplitude of the mass function but mainly on its slope , we rescale @xmath39 to have unity as @xmath19 goes zero .",
    "figure [ fig : nf ] plots the rescaled cumulative mass function @xmath41 at @xmath38 versus @xmath42 for the case of @xmath43kev ( open circles ) and @xmath44kev ( open squares ) . here",
    "@xmath45 corresponds to the free streaming mass scale of a given wdm particle .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath39 begins to decrease as @xmath19 becomes larger than @xmath45 .",
    "the rate of its decrease at @xmath46 depends sensitively on the value of the wdm particle mass @xmath2 : it decreases more rapidly with @xmath19 for the case of smaller value of @xmath2 .",
    "it is because the less massive wdm particles have smaller free - stream scales . to quantify the rate of the decrease of @xmath39 at @xmath46",
    ", we fit @xmath47 to a power - law @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) in the mass range where @xmath50 . in the higher mass section where @xmath51 drops exponentially with @xmath19 , we expect basically no early universe filaments . as demonstrated by @xcite , only those early - universe filaments with mass comparable in order of magnitude to the wdm free - streaming scale can form which are in turn related to the first - generation supermassive black holes that power the observed high-@xmath1 luminous quasars . the higher mass section where @xmath52 correspond to the scales order - of - magnitude larger than the free streaming scale of a given wdm particles .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] represent the power - law fitting of the cumulative mass function of early universe filaments .",
    "as can be seen , the slope @xmath53 indeed depends sensitively on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "the discovery of a supermassive black hole with mass @xmath54 in quasar sdss j1148 + 5251 at @xmath55 @xcite has raised a crucial question of what seeded such a supermassive black hole at that early epoch ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as introduced in  1 ,",
    "@xcite have studied the formation of early - universe filaments using high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations for a wdm cosmology and suggested that the ultimate collapse of the wdm filaments along the longest axes should induce vigorous collisions between gas clouds and stars due to their high densities , which would in turn seed the formation of supermassive black holes that power quasars at @xmath5 . in subsequent evolution , the black holes would grow active by accreting baryonic gases and dark matter particles that constituted their parent filaments . in this picture , the number density of active black holes at high redshifts would be related to that of early universe filaments .",
    "the luminosity function @xmath56 of high-@xmath1 quasars at @xmath57 was determined by @xcite , who showed that @xmath56 can be well approximated as a power law with high - end slope in the range of @xmath58 .",
    "if these high-@xmath1 quasars are indeed powered by the first - generation supermassive black holes formed through the ultimate collapse of the wdm filaments , the high - end slope of the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function should be consistent with the power - law slope of the mass function of early - universe filaments determined in  2 .",
    "varying the value of @xmath2 , we determine the power - law slopes of the mass function of early - universe filaments @xmath53 , which are shown in figure [ fig : slope ] .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 range of the high - end slope of the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function @xmath56 measured from sdss dr3 are shown as horizontal dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the comparison indicates that the two slopes agree with each other when @xmath2 is a few kev .",
    "motivated by the recent heuristic work of @xcite , we have constructed an analytic model for the mass function of the early - universe filaments in a wdm universe .",
    "then we test the possibility of using it as a new wdm constraint . as a feasibility study",
    ", we compare the high - end slope of the mass function of the early - universe filaments to that of the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function determined from sdss dr3 and find a new wdm constraint , @xmath61 a few kev .",
    "this preliminary result looks consistent with the super - symmetric picture @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the mass function of the early - universe filament as a wdm constraint lies in the fact that the model is purely analytical , free of any fitting or nuisance parameter .",
    "it depends only on the wdm particle mass other than the key cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , when the analytic model is compared to the observational result , it is not required to account for any complicated baryon physics since we consider only the _ slope _ of the mass function .    yet",
    ", there are a couple of simplified assumptions on which our model is based .",
    "first , the redshifts of the quasars should be higher than @xmath5 for a more fair comparison . in this work",
    ", we just used the redshift range @xmath57 , assuming that the quasars at @xmath57 correspond to the first generation . to be more realistic",
    ", it will be required to determine the luminosity function of the quasars at @xmath5 , but there are only small number of quasars have so far been observed at that high redshift .",
    "for example , @xcite determined the supermassive black hole mass function at @xmath62 using a tens of quasars and found the high - end slope in a much larger range of @xmath63 , which obviously suffers from large uncertainty due to the small number statistics .",
    "anyway , we would like to mention clearly that the true high - end slope of the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function is currently significantly more uncertain than the data used here .",
    "second , the analytic model for the mass function of early universe filaments has to be refined .",
    "our model is the simplest approximation based on the zeldovich approximation and the press - schechter theory .",
    "the validity of our model has to be tested numerically before using it in practice .",
    "third , the evolution of the early - universe filaments has not been taken into account properly for the evaluation of the mass function . in reality , before their eventual collapse at @xmath5 , the early - universe filaments may undergo fragmentation due to the tidal effect from the surrounding matter . to account for the evolutionary effects , it will be anyway required to refine the model with the help of the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "our future work is in this direction .    as a final conclusion ,",
    "our model and the preliminary result from our feasibility study has provided a proof of concept that the high-@xmath1 quasar luminosity function will be in principle a useful wdm probe .",
