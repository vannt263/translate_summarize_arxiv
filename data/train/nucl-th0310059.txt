    "in this work we apply the model we have developed in these last years @xcite-@xcite to describe electromagnetic responses by considering also short - range correlations ( src ) to the case of the electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout from nuclei .",
    "the aim of our model is to take into account the src in electromagnetic processes involving nuclei with @xmath2 , in such a way that different processes , like inclusive electron scattering , one- and two - nucleon emission induced by electron scattering and , eventually , real photon scattering , can be described by using the same methodology .",
    "the idea was to have a consistent view of the different processes .",
    "the linear response of the nucleus to an external operator @xmath3 can be written as : @xmath4 with @xmath5 where we have defined @xmath6 this function involves the transition matrix element between the initial and the final states of the nucleus .",

    "we insert the main approximation of our model by truncating resulting expansion such as only those diagrams which involve a single correlation function @xmath13 are retained : @xmath15 in the above expression the subscript @xmath16 indicates that only linked diagrams are included in the expansion .    for one - particle one - hole final states ,",
    "the function @xmath11 includes three terms : @xmath17     meyer - like diagrams contributing to @xmath18 . ]",

    "in addition to the uncorrelated transition represented by the one - point diagram ( 1.1 ) .",
    "but , besides , also 4 two - point diagrams and 6 three - point diagrams are present",
    ". these new terms are necessary to get a proper normalization of the nuclear wave functions . in the figure ,",
    "the black squares represent the points where the external operator is acting , the dashed lines represent the correlation function @xmath13 and the continuous oriented lines represent the single - particle wave functions .",

    "a sum over @xmath19 and @xmath20 is understood .",
    "our model was tested by comparing our nuclear matter charge response functions with those obtained by considering the full cluster expansion @xcite . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:1p1h - comp ] both calculations overlap and this gave us confidence to extend the model to other situations .    with this model",
    "we have analyzed different processes involving both real and virtual photons .",
    "inclusive ( e , e ) excitation of discrete nuclear states showed a very small effect due to src @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "inclusive electron scattering in the quasi - elastic peak region presented src contributions smaller than final state interactions effects @xcite .",
    "these last also dominate in the case of ( e , ep ) reactions @xcite .",

    "to get rid of this contribution one has to investigate two nucleon emission processes . in this case",
    "one deals with two - body operators which can be either one - body operators acting in correlated nuclear states or mec . if , in addition , one chooses two - proton emission , mec involving charged mesons do not contribute and the situation is , at least in principle , rather clean to investigate src effects .    in case one",
    "has two - particle two - hole final states , the function @xmath11 includes two terms : @xmath24 the first term ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag-2p2h ] ) consists of 4 two - point diagrams .",
    "the second one results from the sum of 8 three - point diagrams . as in the previous case ,",
    "this set of diagrams conserves the correct normalization .    the geometry of the two - proton emission process produced by electron scattering from nuclei is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the cross section is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the energy of the outgoing electron , @xmath27 is the solid angle of its direction , @xmath28 is the energy of the one emitted proton , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the solid angles of the directions of the two emitted protons , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are their momenta , @xmath33 is the proton mass , @xmath34 is the mott cross section and @xmath35 describes the recoil of the residual nucleus .",
    "the @xmath36 s are kinematic factors , while the @xmath37 responses include the information about the nuclear structure and are given in terms of matrix elements of the charge and current operators .    in our calculations we have considered the charge and the magnetization current one - body operators and the @xmath0-isobar two - body current , specifically these terms proportional to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the hole wave functions have been obtained from a woods - saxon potential whose parameters have been fixed to reproduce rms charge radii and single particle energies around the fermi energy , while for the particles wave functions we used the optical potential of schwandt _ et al .",
    "the particular aspect we have investigated concerns to the sensitivity of the ( e , e2p ) cross section to the details of the src .",
    "this has been done by using the three correlation functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] .",
    "the g ( gaussian ) and s3 correlations , have been taken from a fhnc calculation done with semi - realistic interaction @xcite .",
    "the v8 correlation is the scalar part of a state dependent correlation used in fhnc calculation done with a v8 argonne interaction plus three - body urbana ix interaction @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the g and s3 interaction is almost the same , while the v8 interaction has a deeper value .",
    "the v8 and s3 correlations overshoot the asymptotic value of 1 in the region between r=1 and 2 fm .",
    "the cross sections obtained with these correlations for @xmath1o are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3v8 ] . apart the result of the 1@xmath39 state dominated by the two - body currents ,",
    "all the other results have common trends .",
    "first , one should notice that the use of different correlations does not change the shape of the angular distribution .",
    "second , the cross sections obtained with the gaussian correlation , are larger than the other ones .    to understand this result , we have done a set of calculations with rather schematic correlations .",
    "these correlations are shown in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] .",
    "the cross sections calculated with these correlations are shown in the other panels by lines of the same type . in these calculations",
    "the two - body @xmath0 currents have not been included .",
    "the box correlation indicated by the full line is our reference correlation .",
    "lowering the minimum ( dashed lines ) does not produce a large effect .",
    "the insertion of a part which overshoots the asymptotic value reduces the cross section ( dotted lines ) .",
    "an analogous effect is obtained by reducing the size of the box ( dashed - dotted lines ) .",
    "these results can be understood by remembering that the quantity entering in the cross section calculation is @xmath40 .",
    "the largest is the contribution of @xmath13 to @xmath41 , the largest is the cross section .",
    "the overshooting of the asymptotic value , generates a term in @xmath42 of opposite sign with respect to the rest of the function , therefore the total contribution to the integral becomes smaller .",
    "the same effect can be obtained by reducing the size of the box as it is shown by the dashed dotted lines .",
    "to finish , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:2p3pdd ] the effect of each of the three ingredients of the transition operator : the two- and three - point diagrams coming from the one - body charge and current operators and the @xmath0-isobar current .",
    "as we can see , this last dominates the @xmath43 results , while for the @xmath44 the terms associated to src ( in particular , these corresponding to 2-point diagrams ) produce the larger contributions . in the case of the @xmath45 ,",
    "the 3-point diagrams are also relevant .",
    "we have presented here results for the ( e , e2p ) process in @xmath1o and @xmath46ca obtained within a model which includes the effect of scalar src through diagrams with only one correlation line .",
    "we have found that qualitative features , such as the shape of the angular distributions , are not sensitive to the details of the src . on the other hand , slight differences in the correlation function",
    "produce large modifications in the size of the cross sections .",
    "however , the information about the src can be obtained only by a quantitative comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "unfortunately the quantitative evaluation of the ( e , e2p ) cross sections suffers from the uncertainties inherent to the required theoretical input .",
    "these kind of experiments are not the unique tool to extract the characteristics of the src correlations , but another procedure allowing , together with elastic , inclusive and one - nucleon emission experiments , to obtain the information we are looking for .",
    "we are trying to describe all these process in a unique and coherent theoretical framework , thus permitting meaningful analysis of all of them .",
