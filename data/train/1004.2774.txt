    "unveiling the origin of the current accelerating expansion of our universe is a big challenge for the modern cosmology either theoretically or observationally .",
    "the origin source which drives the expansion could be attributed to a mysterious budget , dark energy .",
    "thus , the nature of dark energy is one of the biggest unsolved problems in modern physics and has been extensively investigated in recent years .",
    "the measurements of cmb @xcite , lss surveys @xcite and sn @xcite have provided a lot of high quality data at present .",
    "these data have been widely used to constrain various cosmological models .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the degeneracies of cosmological parameters generally exist in almost all cosmological observations , i.e. , they are not sensitive to single parameters but to some specific combinations of them",
    ". these degeneracies could weaken constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "it is therefore highly necessary to combine different probes to break parameter degeneracies so as to achieve tight constraints .",
    "furthermore , different observations are affected by different systematic errors , and it is thus helpful to reduce potential biases by combining different probes .",
    "one of the useful complementary probe is the late - time isw effect @xcite .",
    "this isw effect is produced by the cmb photons passing through the time - evolving gravitational potential well , when dark energy or curvature becomes important at later times .",
    "therefore , the isw effect provides a promising probe for studying the acceleration mechanism of our universe , especially for the dark energy and the curvature of universe .",
    "cross correlating cmb with tracers of lss surveys for detecting the isw effect @xcite has been widely investigated in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the constraints on various cosmological models from the current observations , including the wmap5 data , sn  union \" compilation , and recently released bao data from sdss dr7 , as well as the isw data .",
    "the structured of the paper is as following : in section ii we describe the method and the data sets ; in section iii we present our numerical results and discussion ; finally we give a summary and outlook in section vi .",
    "for the parametrizations of dark energy models , we adopt @xmath0cdm model and dynamical dark energy model with cpl parametrization @xcite as following : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scale factor and @xmath7 characterizes the  running \" of the equation - of - state ( eos ) of dark energy . in the @xmath0cdm model , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    for dark energy models",
    "whose eos is not equal to @xmath10 during the evolution of universe , the perturbation of dark energy will inevitably exist .",
    "the perturbation of dark energy has no effect on the geometric constraints .",
    "however , when including the cmb and lss data , the perturbation of dark energy should be fully considered , because the late time isw effect will be different significantly , and will take an important signature on large angular scales of cmb and the matter power spectrum of lss @xcite . for quintessence - like or phantom - like models ,",
    "in which @xmath11 does not cross the cosmological constant boundary , the perturbation of dark energy is well defined .",
    "however , when @xmath11 crosses @xmath10 , one is encountered with the divergence problem for perturbations of dark energy at @xmath12 . in order to solve this problem in the global analysis",
    ", we introduce a small positive constant @xmath13 to divide the full range of the allowed value of the eos @xmath11 into three parts : 1 ) @xmath14 ; 2 ) @xmath15 ; and 3 ) @xmath16 .    working in the conformal newtonian gauge",
    ", the perturbations of de can be described by & = & -(1+w)(-3 ) -3(c_s^2-w )  , [ dotdelta ] + & = & -(1 - 3w)- + k^2(+ )   .",
    "[ dottheta ] neglecting the entropy perturbation , for the regions 1 ) and 3 ) , the eos does not across @xmath10 and the perturbation is well defined by solving eqs.([dotdelta],[dottheta ] ) . for the case 2 ) , the perturbation of energy density @xmath17 and divergence of velocity , @xmath18 , and the derivatives of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are finite and continuous for the realistic dark energy models .",
    "however for the perturbations of the parameterizations , there is clearly a divergence . in our analysis for such a regime",
    ", we match the perturbations in region 2 ) to the regions 1 ) and 3 ) at the boundary and set @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in our numerical calculations",
    "we limit the range to be @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in which @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath1 is the spatial curvature and satisfies @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath28 is the optical depth to re - ionization , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the parameters of dark energy eos given by eq.([cpl ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 characterize the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations , @xmath31 is the sound speed of dark energy . for the pivot scale",
    "we set @xmath32mpc@xmath33 .    in the computation of cmb",
    "we have included the wmap5 temperature and polarization power spectra with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team .",
    "we also combine the distance measurements from bao and snia . for the bao information",
    ", we use the newly released gaussian priors on the distance ratios , @xmath34 at @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath38 , which were measured from the power spectrum for the distribution of the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) galaxy sample and the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) data@xcite . for the calculation of the likelihood from supernova",
    ", we use are the  union \" compilation ( 307 sample ) @xcite and have marginalized over the nuisance parameter @xcite .    for the isw data",
    ", we have included the package for calculating the isw likelihood function provided by ref.@xcite , which contain a @xmath39 detection of isw by cross correlating wmap data with the lss data sets of 2-micron all sky survey sample , sdss photometric luminous red galaxies , sdss photometric quasars , and nrao vla sky survey radio sources . in our calculations , we have taken the total likelihood to be the products of the separate likelihoods @xmath40 of cmb , bao , sn and isw .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the newly released hst prior on the hubble constant , which is the measurement of the hubble parameter by the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 2 of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and give @xmath41h  km  s@xmath33  mpc@xmath33 by a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath42 and with a standard deviation @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "in this section we present our global fitting results of the cosmological parameters determined from the latest observational data .",
    "table i. mean @xmath44 constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath45 from different data combinations in the @xmath0cdm model .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now present the constraints on dark energy parameters . in ref.@xcite , they considered the constraints on dark energy model with constant eos , and found that the isw data could modestly improve constraint of dark energy eos . as we know , the variation of dark energy eos could also affect the evolution of gravitational potential , and the isw effect consequently .",
    "it would be worth checking the capabilities of isw data on the constraint of time - varying dark energy eos . in fig.[fig3 ]",
    "we plot the two dimensional contours of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from different data combinations .",
    "the black solid lines are given by fitting with the combination of wmap5 temperature and polarization power spectra , supernovae data , as well as the newly released bao data .",
    "due to the limits of the precisions of observational data , the variance of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are still large , namely the @xmath46 constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , which are listed in table ii .",
    "this result implies that the dynamical dark energy models are not excluded and the current data can not distinguish different dark energy models decisively .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model , however , is still a good fit right now .",
    "we also include the isw data into the calculations . from the red dashed lines in fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", we can find that the constraints on the dark energy eos parameters slightly improve from wmap5+sn+bao+isw combination .",
    "the @xmath46 intervals are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the isw data help tighten the lower limit on @xmath3 and the upper limit on @xmath4 , but not significantly .",
    "these is due to the constraining power of snia and bao , while the current isw data are still not constraining enough .",
    "however , the isw data could be a useful probe for constraining other dark energy models , such as the early dark energy model @xcite .",
    "and they also found that the future isw data can improve the constraints on the most important cosmological parameters by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "again , we also compare the constraints on dark energy parameters between from the new hst prior and from the old one .",
    "when we combine wmap5 , sn , bao , as well as the old hst prior , we obtain that the @xmath52 constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which is slightly weaker than those from the new hst prior .",
    "if dark energy is not the cosmological constant , we should consider the dark energy perturbations in our calculations . in the framework of the linear perturbations theory , besides the eos of dark energy , the dark energy perturbations can also be characterized by the sound speed , @xmath55 .",
    "the sound speed of dark energy affects the evolution of perturbations , and leaves the signatures on the cmb power spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus , in the literature constraining on the sound speed @xmath31 from different observational data has been widely investigated ( e.g. refs.@xcite ) .    here",
    ", we also constrain the dark energy sound speed from current data in the dynamical dark energy model . in fig.[figcs ] , we show the one dimensional constraint on the dark energy sound speed @xmath56 from the combination of wmap5 temperature and polarization power spectra , snia and bao , as well as the isw data . we can find that the constraint on the dark energy sound speed @xmath31 are still very weak .",
    "the current observational data are still not accurate enough .     from wmap5+sn+bao+isw combination in the dynamical dark energy model .",
    "[ figcs ] ]",
    "in this paper , we study the constraints on cosmological parameters from the recently released cmb , bao and snia data . here , we pay particular attention to the current isw data which is the cross correlations of cmb with lss surveys . in the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "the isw data and the new hst prior are very helpful to break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath57 . the constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath57 significantly improve , when compared to the constraints from wmap5 alone .",
    "more importantly , we consider the constraints on the dark energy parameters in the cpl dark energy model . here , we fully include the perturbations of dark energy .",
    "this result implies that the dynamical dark energy models are not excluded , the @xmath0cdm model , however , is still a good fit right now .",
    "we find that the isw data could give slight improvement of the constraints on cpl dark energy model .",
    "but this does not mean that the isw data can not constrain the dynamical dark energy models efficiently .",
    "actually , it should be useful for constraining the dynamical dark energy models whose eos @xmath58 deviate from the cosmological constant boundary obviously , for example , the early dark energy models @xcite , or the dark energy model with its eos @xmath58 transits sharply during its evolution .",
    "besides the dark energy models , the isw data could be also helpful for testing the modified gravity theories @xcite , massive neutrinos @xcite , the primordial non - gaussianity @xcite , and so on .",
    "furthermore , we compare the constraints between from the new hst prior and from the old one .",
    "one can see that the new hst prior gives the tighter constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "finally , we check the capability of current observational data to constrain the dark energy sound speed @xmath56 .",
    "we find that the sound speed is weakly constrained by current observations , and thus futuristic precision measurements of the cmb on a very large angular scale ( low multipoles ) are necessary .",
    "we acknowledge the use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) . support for lambda is provided by the nasa office of space science .",
