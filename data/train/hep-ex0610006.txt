    "in the past decade , we have seen enormous progress in understanding flavor physics and @xmath1 violation . after turning on in 1999 , the new asymmetric - energy @xmath0 factories , pep - ii  @xcite and kekb  @xcite , quickly achieved luminosities that exceeded their design targets and the expectations of many .",
    "this allowed the corresponding experiments , babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite , to quickly provide the first precision test of the ckm  @xcite mechanism for @xmath1 violation .",
    "the measurements of the proper - time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetry in charmonium-@xmath2 decays of neutral @xmath0 mesons ( @xmath3)@xcite are in very good agreement with the ckm prediction of @xmath3 from independent constraints .",
    "it is convenient , both for visualization and quantitative analysis , to interpret experimental results within the ckm framework as constraints on the geometry of the so - called `` unitarity triangle ''  @xcite , which is from the first and third columns of the ckm quark mixing matrix @xmath4 @xmath5 if one renormalizes the triangle by rescaling the sides by @xmath6 and adopts the wolfenstein phase convention  @xcite , experimental results are interpreted as constraints on the apex of the triangle ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "two independent groups ( ckmfitter@xcite and utfit@xcite ) provide the results of this analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] shows the constraints on the apex of the unitarity triangle as of the fpcp06 conference .",
    "one can see that in addition to the precise determination of @xmath8 , mentioned above , the @xmath0 factory data strongly constrains the left side of the triangle , which is proportional to @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 factory experiments have also measured the other two angles of triangle ( @xmath10@xcite and @xmath11@xcite ) . finally , the tevatron experiments , cdf and d0 , have recently measured @xmath12@xcite , the frequency of @xmath13 oscillations , which allows the right side of the triangle to be constrained , when combined with @xmath14 and some input from lattice qcd calculations@xcite .",
    "it s clear from figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] that the ckm model ( and thus the standard model ) gives a remarkably consistent description of all experimental results .",
    "it s natural to ask whether there is still room for discovering physics beyond the standard model ( or new physics ) in @xmath0 decays , after seeing such consistency .",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "the most precise constraints in figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] come from either tree - level @xmath0 decays or from @xmath0 mixing . from figure",
    "[ fig : rhoeta ] , one can reasonably conclude that there is little room for substantial new physics corrections to tree - dominated processes  @xcite . however , new physics may significantly alter the observables ( branching fractions , asymmetries , ... ) for rare @xmath0 decays without disturbing the beautiful consistency shown in figure  [ fig : rhoeta ] .",
    "rare @xmath0 decays are a unique and valuable tool in the search for new physics .",
    "decays that are allowed at the tree level have relatively large amplitudes . if amplitudes from new physics are small , as we expect , hadronic uncertainties will prevent us from recognizing the presence of new physics in many cases . on the other hand ,",
    "decays that proceed through annihilation or loop topologies at leading order are highly suppressed , thus considerably reducing the impact of hadronic uncertainties in the search for new physics .",
    "loop topologies , such as penguin decays , are particularly attractive .",
    "virtual new particles ( e.g. supersymmetric particles ) with masses on the order of 100 s of gev may contribute loop contributions to these decays potentially altering the decay rate , @xmath1 asymmetry , and other observable quantities .",
    "it is important to have standard model predictions for rare decay observables with theoretical uncertainties that are under control and as low as possible . an excellent way to do",
    "this is to have uncertainties cancel in a ratio , such as a @xmath1 asymmetry .",
    "time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetries in penguin - dominated decays , such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 are a prime example that i will discuss . another way is to avoid hadrons in the final state .",
    "i will review the latest results on @xmath0 decays to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 final states .",
    "finally , one can use both techniques .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 asymmetry in @xmath22 or the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath23 .",
    "the list of topics above is certainly not a complete inventory of the avenues being pursued .",
    "i chose to focus on them because they are areas where recent progress has been made and/or because they are channels with relatively small theoretical uncertainties . before continuing , i would like to point out that there have been very good recent reviews on many of the topics that i will cover , such as reference  @xcite , that the reader may be interested in for more details or a different point of view .",
    "time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetries in @xmath24 penguin decays provide an excellent way to search for new physics  @xcite .",
    "as i will describe below , most hadronic uncertainties cancel in the standard model calculation of the expected asymmetry , so there are precise predictions to compare our measurements with .",
    "contributions from non - standard - mode particles may give large ( order 1 ) corrections to the @xmath1 asymmetries . a large deviation from the standard model expectation",
    "would be an unambiguous sign of new physics .",
    "the standard model interpretation of a time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetry is theoretically clean _ if _ one decay amplitude dominates ( or , more technically , if all dominant decay amplitude contributions share the same @xmath1-violating phase ) .",
    "the most familiar example of this is @xmath25 .",
    "the leading decay amplitude is a color - suppressed tree diagram .",
    "the largest amplitude with a different weak phase comes from a @xmath24 penguin diagram with an intermediate @xmath26 quark , which is suppressed with respect to the dominant amplitude by a relative @xmath27 factor of about 0.02 , loop vs tree suppression , and by the need to create a @xmath28 pair .",
    "thus , the standard model predicts that the amplitude of the time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetry for the @xmath29 final state is @xmath30 with an uncertainty of less than 1%  @xcite .    the time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetry for decays that proceed through a penguin @xmath24 transition is also expected to be close to @xmath3 .",
    "however , the corrections from suppressed @xmath31 amplitudes are in general larger . for @xmath32 transitions , such as @xmath33 or @xmath34 ,",
    "the only @xmath31 amplitude comes from the @xmath24 penguin diagram with an intermediate @xmath26 quark . here , both the leading and ckm suppressed contributions are both penguins , differing only by the intermediate quarks in the loop . for decays such as @xmath35 ,",
    "a color - suppressed @xmath31 tree diagram may also contribute , since the @xmath36 has both @xmath37 and @xmath38 content .",
    "in this situation , the dominant amplitudes are loop suppressed , so the @xmath31 tree contribution is more of a concern .",
    "the key theoretical task is to determine or place an upper bound on the relative size of the @xmath31 amplitudes , which involves calculating or constraining the ratio of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "there has been a tremendous amount of theoretical work on estimating the standard model uncertainty on the @xmath1 asymmetry in @xmath24 penguin decays  @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates are given in terms of the maximum deviation from @xmath3 of the measured @xmath39 coefficient @xmath40 of the @xmath1 asymmetry for final state @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "conservative model - independent estimates of @xmath43 are on the same order or larger than the current experimental errors .",
    "model dependent calculations estimate @xmath44 , including its sign , and have uncertainties at the level of 1 to 2 % .",
    "the most interesting channels , both experimentally and theoretically , are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath45 mode is a pure @xmath32 transition with a clean experimental signature .",
    "the @xmath46 mode is not a pure @xmath32 transition but model estimates predict a very small @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 mode also has an unusually large branching fraction so the statistical errors on the @xmath40 measurements are best for this decay .",
    "as with the theoretical uncertainties , many experimental systematic uncertainties cancel in the @xmath1 asymmetry .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the @xmath40 measurements are 3 to 5 times smaller than the statistical errors . both the babar and belle experiments",
    "reconstruct the @xmath47 and the more challenging @xmath48 final states in order to maximize their signal statistics .     for several @xmath24",
    "penguin decays .",
    "the standard model predicts @xmath49 if @xmath31 amplitude contributions are neglected .",
    "figure courtesy of the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag)@xcite.,width=283 ]    figure  [ fig : speng ] summarizes the @xmath40 measurements for many @xmath24 penguin decay modes , as compiled by the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag)@xcite . none of the channels show a significant discrepancy with the standard model expectation of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the @xmath1 eigenvalue of the final state @xmath41 .",
    "the measurements tend to be below @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath52 ) which is interesting because model predictions give small _ positive _ values of @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "there is still room for discovery , since the measurements are and will be statistics limited for the foreseeable future , though a super @xmath0 factory  @xcite may be required to achieve the sensitivity necessary for a discovery .",
    "@xmath0 decays to purely leptonic final states are theoretically advantageous , since the hadronic uncertainties mainly come from a single parameter , the @xmath53 meson decay constant @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath0 decay constant can be computed using lattice qcd  @xcite or measured from a leptonic @xmath0 decay branching fraction , as we will see .",
    "new physics can greatly enhance leptonic @xmath0 decay rates in some scenarios , so searching for them is a good way to search for new physics .      the decay @xmath55 is highly suppressed in the standard model , since it can only proceed through a box diagram or a @xmath56 penguin .",
    "the current sm prediction is @xmath57  @xcite . in some new physics scenarios ,",
    "the branching fraction can be enhanced by by a high power of @xmath58 ( e.g. @xmath59 in supersymmetry or @xmath60 in 2 higgs doublet models ) , where @xmath58 is the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values . for large @xmath58 ,",
    "the branching fraction could be enhanced by two orders of magnitude , which is currently within reach of the cdf and d0 experiments .",
    "the tevatron has a 4-order - of - magnitude advantage over the @xmath0 factories ( babar and belle ) in the @xmath61 production cross section .",
    "it also produces all types of @xmath62-quark hadrons , while @xmath63 is above threshold for the @xmath64 resonance , where most of the @xmath0 factory data have been collected .",
    "the main disadvantage of the tevatron is that the @xmath61 cross section is only @xmath65 of the total inelastic @xmath66 cross section , so for most @xmath0 decays , qcd background is a major obstacle .",
    "fortunately , both cdf and d0 can easily trigger on muons .",
    "the cdf experiment has recently updated their search for @xmath55 with 780  pb@xmath67 of run ii data  @xcite .",
    "they use a likelihood ratio that combines three discriminating variables to reject combinatoric background for events with a di - muon invariant mass close to the @xmath13 .",
    "the variables are the reconstructed decay length , the consistency between the the vector that points from the primary vertex to the di - muon vertex and the di - muon momentum vector , and the degree to which the muons are isolated in the event . after requiring the likelihood ratio to be greater than 0.99 ,",
    "the expected background is 1.3 events .",
    "they observed one event in the signal box , consistent with the background estimate , and set an upper limit of @xmath68 at 95% confidence level .",
    "this is only a factor of 30 above the standard model prediction .",
    "the d0 collaboration last updated their @xmath55 search using 300  pb@xmath67 of run ii data  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that @xmath69 has connections to cosmology and dark matter .",
    "for example , reference  @xcite has pointed out that the @xmath55 branching fraction is strongly correlated with the neutralino - proton scattering cross section for large @xmath58 .",
    "the lack of an observation of this mode at the tevatron disfavors a large @xmath58 and implies that the neutralino - proton cross section is well below the sensitivity of direct detection experiments , such as cdms  ii .",
    "the leptonic decay @xmath70 is the least helicity suppressed , as can be seen by the relation below for the branching fraction : @xmath71 the standard model prediction for the branching fraction is @xmath72  @xcite , where the uncertainty is dominated by the calculation of @xmath73 from lattice qcd ( @xmath74)@xcite and @xmath9 from semileptonic @xmath0 decays ( @xmath75)@xcite . this is now within reach of the current @xmath0 factories . measuring this branching fraction is the most straightforward way to experimentally test the lattice calculation of the @xmath0 decay constant @xmath73 .",
    "large enhancements of the branching fraction are possible in some new physics models , such as the two - higgs - doublet model described in reference  @xcite with large @xmath58 .",
    "the belle experiment has recently reported evidence  @xcite for @xmath70 .",
    "i will describe their analysis in the remainder of this subsection .",
    "this decay is very challenging due to the presence of at least two neutrinos in the final state . in @xmath0",
    "decays with only one neutrino , the neutrino can be reconstructed from the missing momentum of the event , assuming the neutrino is massless . with two or more neutrinos , the missing invariant",
    "mass is , in general , non - zero , so the kinematics ca nt be inferred from the missing momentum alone .",
    "the technique that has been used by both the belle and babar experiments has been to fully reconstruct the other @xmath0 ( or the `` tag '' @xmath0 ) in the event and then search for the @xmath70 decay in the recoil .",
    "the tag @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency is around @xmath76% .    fully reconstructing the tag @xmath0 serves two purposes .",
    "first , it determines the _ a priori _ unknown direction of the signal @xmath0 momentum vector . secondly , and more importantly",
    ", it allows a full reconstruction of the event ( minus the neutrinos ) .",
    "the signal @xmath77 decay is reconstructed with an efficiency of 33% in 5 decay modes that correspond to 81% of all @xmath77 decays : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "since all of the observable decay products ( everything but the neutrinos ) have been accounted for in the reconstruction of the tag @xmath0 and the @xmath77 , there should be no additional tracks in the event and the unaccounted - for calorimeter energy should be close to zero .",
    "the main discriminating variable in the belle analysis , after all selection criteria are applied , is the remaining ( extra ) energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter @xmath83 , which should be consistent with zero for signal events .",
    "the number of expected background events in a defined signal region near zero is @xmath84 .",
    "a total of 54 events were observed in the signal region indicating the presence of a signal .",
    "an unbinned likelihood fit of the @xmath83 spectrum gave a fitted signal yield of @xmath85 events for a significance of @xmath86 , including systematic uncertainties .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath70 branching fraction   with a signal significance of @xmath87 , including systematic errors . as of the writing of the report",
    ", reference  @xcite has not been updated to correct the reported error .",
    "] of @xmath88 , which is consistent with the standard model expectation of about @xmath89 .",
    "the fact that an excess over the standard model prediction was not observed rules out a region of charged higgs mass vs @xmath58 in the model described in  @xcite . in the future , improved measurements of @xmath90 will provide a valuable experimental benchmark for the lattice qcd prediction of @xmath73 .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath91 and @xmath92 decays is closely linked .",
    "standard model calculations for these rare decays are performed using an effective hamiltonian that is written in terms of several short - distance operators  @xcite .",
    "wilson coefficients quantify the relative strength of the different short - distance contributions .",
    "standard model predictions for observable quantities , such as differential decay rates , can be written in terms of effective wilson coefficients , which include higher - order corrections .",
    "the process @xmath91 is dominated by the photon penguin operator , with wilson coefficient @xmath93 , while @xmath92 also has contributions from semileptonic vector and axial - vector operators with wilson coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "experimentally , we wish to measure @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . new physics may alter the magnitude and/or sign of the effective wilson coefficients .",
    "if a deviation from the standard model is observed , it can be used to distinguish between different models for new physics , since the new physics predictions for the deviations are not universal  @xcite .",
    "gino isidori recently called @xmath96 `` the most effective np killer ''  @xcite .",
    "there are two complimentary experimental approaches . in the semi - inclusive @xmath97 approach ,",
    "several @xmath98 states are explicitly reconstructed ( e.g. @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , etc ... ) .",
    "the total @xmath97 rate is then computed by estimating the contribution from the missing @xmath98 states . the uncertainty in estimating",
    "the contribution from missing states is significant .",
    "on the other hand , only the photon is explicitly reconstructed in the fully inclusive approach . the huge background from continuum events ( @xmath102 with @xmath103 or @xmath104 )",
    "is suppressed by requiring the presence of a high - momentum lepton from the semileptonic decay of the other @xmath0 in the event .",
    "the remaining continuum background is then subtracted using @xmath105 data taken just below the @xmath64 resonance .",
    "the two methods have similar precision .",
    "the current hfag world average  @xcite for @xmath106  gev is @xmath107 where the uncertainties , from left to right , are from experimental statistical and systematic sources , the @xmath108 shape function , and the subtraction of @xmath109 .",
    "the next - to - leading - order theoretical prediction of the same quantity  @xcite is @xmath110 the remarkable agreement effectively fixes @xmath111 to the standard model value .",

    ", @xmath115 remains below 2% , while others allow @xmath115 to be of order 10% .",
    "the hfag average  @xcite experimental value is @xmath116 which is consistent with the standard model prediction .",
    "the statistical errors on the @xmath0 factory measurements  @xcite@xcite are about 5% while the systematic errors are 2.6% and 1.5% respectively .",
    "these measurements are based on 80  fb@xmath67 and 140  fb@xmath67 of on - resonance data , so the precision of the world average will continue to improve .",
    "the amplitude for the process @xmath109 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath117 with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "smaller amplitudes , in general , have higher sensitivity to new physics contributions .",
    "the branching fraction is suppressed by a factor of @xmath118 making this channel extremely challenging .",
    "if the @xmath109 rate is measured , it can be combined with the @xmath91 rate to constrain @xmath119 , which is essentially the right side of the unitarity triangle , since many of the hadronic uncertainties cancel in the ratio of exclusive modes .",
    "belle has recently observed the @xmath109 process for the first time  @xcite , by exclusively reconstructing @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "the relative strength of the contributions depends on @xmath125 , which is the square of the di - lepton invariant mass .",
    "differential measurements as a function of @xmath125 measure the amount of @xmath126 interference , thus constraining the wilson coefficients .",
    "some new physics models wiggle out of the stringent constraint on @xmath111 from @xmath91 by simply changing the _ sign _ of @xmath93 . in @xmath124 , changing the sign of @xmath93 would enhance the overall @xmath124 rate , particularly in the low-@xmath125 range , essentially by changing destructive interference into constructive interference  @xcite .    the inclusive @xmath124 rate has been measured in bins of @xmath125 by both babar and belle .",
