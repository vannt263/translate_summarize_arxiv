    "for over half a century , the crab nebula has played a key role as a laboratory for many seminal discoveries regarding supernovae and their remnants @xcite .",
    "it is also the brightest and best studied example of `` plerionic '' remnants which are powered by a compact central object ( see reviews @xcite ) .    despite its many astronomical firsts ,",
    "the detection by @xcite of chains of semi - stellar , optical knots showing unusually strong [ ar  iii ] line emission was both remarkable and puzzling .",
    "the discovery came about through a search looking for north - south , bi - polar axial phenomena directly associated with the crab pulsar and related to the remnant s east - west band of strong helium emission filaments @xcite and the n - s hourglass structure seen in polarized light of the crab s synchrotron nebula @xcite .    using a fabry - perot imager centered at 5015.3  , @xcite found about a dozen , semi - stellar [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 emission knots aligned in arcs , perhaps helical @xcite , from the pulsar s position with seven to the north and four to the south .",
    "the northern arc of knots appeared situated inside a corridor through the remnant s filamentary structure , the eastern edge of which seemed to merge with the western edge of the crab s well - known northern `` jet '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that this corridor containing the northern knots marked the presence of a directed , north - south collimated wind from the pulsar s vicinity and possibly associated with the pulsar s spin axis @xcite .",
    "subsequent optical spectra of several of these knots revealed remarkably strong [ ar iii ] @xmath07136 and [ s  ii ] @xmath1 line emission .",
    "the knots strong [ ar  iii ] line emission was deemed more remarkable than that of the [ s  ii ] , leading macalpine et al . to refer them as `` argo - knots '' .",
    "their unusual [ ar  iii ] line strength was interpreted as being due to either n(ar@xmath2)/n(h@xmath3 ) ratios @xmath4 higher than in typical crab filaments , unusually high knot electron temperatures , or some process(es ) not normally important in nebula astrophysics .",
    "perhaps most remarkable was the knots apparent alignment with , and transverse velocities as high as 900 km s@xmath5 away from , the crab pulsar .",
    "the knots arrangement in north and south arcs in striking alignment with the crab pulsar was highly suggestive of a causal link .",
    "this is because the pulsar has a motion toward the northwest away from the crab s expansion point of @xmath6125 km s@xmath5 ( @xmath7 yr@xmath5 , pa = 290@xmath8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the location of the northern knots inside a filamentary corridor associated with the northern jet feature , @xcite also found that the argo - knots north - south alignment to be roughly perpendicular to an apparent east - west torus of high - helium filaments @xcite .",
    "positional measurements for the seven northern and four southern [ ar  iii ] knots using ground - based images taken over a two year baseline ( 1991  1993 ) indicated proper motions of @xmath9 yr@xmath5 or @xmath10 900 km s@xmath5 at the crab s 1830 pc distance @xcite .",
    "although their proper motion results had relatively large associated uncertainties ( @xmath11 yr@xmath5 ) , @xcite concluded that `` all measured north or south motions are directed away from the pulsar , as expected '' .",
    "this conclusion , when taken together with the knots remarkable alignment with the pulsar s current position suggested a kinematic link between the pulsar and these so - called `` argo - knots '' .",
    "however , if these knots were dynamically connected with a collimated wind off the pulsar , it would then mean that they comprise a small but previously unrecognized population of line emitting material within the remnant which does not participate in the remnant s radial expansion from the sn  1054 explosion point @xcite .",
    "non - radial motions in the crab nebula and in particular the presence of high - velocity , line - emitting gas moving rapidly away north and south from the pulsar is an unexpected discovery meriting further examination . in this paper , we present a proper motion and morphological study of a few of these knots using 1994 - 1999 _ hst _ wfpc-2 images of the crab nebula .",
    "wfpc-2 images of the center of the crab nebula from 1994 , 1995 and 1999 were obtained from the data archive at the space telescope science institute ( table 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a 1995 _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 image of the west - central region of the crab nebula taken with the [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 filter ( f502n ) .",
    "the strong [ ar iii ] emitting knots n1  n6 and s1 ",
    "s4 described by @xcite are marked .",
    "other nebular knots having similar `` semi - stellar '' [ o  iii ] morphologies are shown in the image and are labeled k1  k9 .    because all 11 bright [ ar  iii ] knots exhibit prominent [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 and [ s  ii ] @xmath126716,6731 line emissions and positive radial velocities ( + 300 to + 720 km s@xmath5 ; @xcite ) , wfpc-2 images taken using the [ o  iii ] f502n and [ s  ii ] f673n filters are well suited for studying these knots .",
    "both filter bandpass centers are slightly redshifted ( + 360 km s@xmath5 ) and sufficiently wide ( @xmath13 km s@xmath5 ) to cover the knots observed radial velocity range .",
    "in addition , the [ o  iii ] f502n image line center at 5013   is almost identical to the 5015   fabry - perot bandpass center used by @xcite to measure the [ ar  iii ] knots kinematic properties .",
    "pairs of wfpc-2 1994 and 1999 images taken in [ o  iii ] and [ s  ii ] were each combined using the cosmic ray cleaning iraf package `` crrej '' . for the 1995 data ,",
    "two pairs of images were available .",
    "these were also initially combined using `` crrej '' and then one pair was shifted and they were combined again using `` crrej '' .",
    "the combined images for each year were then made into three mosaics representing 1994 , 1995 , and 1999 , and rotated so that all were oriented with north up and east to the left .",
    "pixel image positions of four to six stars present on the 1994 , 1995 , and 1999 images were measured on each of the [ o  iii ] or [ s  ii ] wfpc-2 images ( @xmath14 pixel@xmath5 ) using the iraf task `` imexamine '' .",
    "image positions for the four southern [ ar  iii ] bright nebular knots identified by @xcite were measured both by eye and by using `` imexamine '' , with good agreement between the two methods . since",
    "southern knots s3 and s4 were not imaged on the 1994 images , their proper motion values were determined by comparing only the 1995 and 1999 images . also measured was a similar but somewhat fainter , neighboring feature to knots s1 and s2 which we call `` s0 '' due to its smaller , projected distance from the pulsar than knot s1 .",
    "pixel x and y offsets between the 1994/95 and 1999 images were then obtained and used to predict the 1999 pixel positions of the knots from the 1994 and 1995 images . observed versus predicted knot positions divided by the time interval yielded @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( x and y ) proper motion values .",
    "image pixel x and y differences for the reference stars were each averaged and the standard deviation of each was used as an estimate of the minimum measurement errors .",
    "these were added in quadrature with error estimates based on position differences between the [ o  iii ] and [ s  ii ] knots . because of the large and irregular morphology of knot s3 , its proper motion determination is significantly more uncertain .",
    "the crab pulsar currently lies some @xmath17 northwest of the remnant s estimated expansion center @xcite . to determine whether , as @xcite concluded , [ ar  iii ] bright knots move away from the the crab pulsar `` as expected '' due to a presumed collimated wind off the pulsar or instead move away the remnant s expansion center , we chose to examine the four southern [ ar  iii ] bright knots they identified ( s1s4 ) .",
    "we also included one additional likely [ ar  iii ] knot ( s0 ) we identified from the wfpc-2 [ o  iii ] images .",
    "this latter knot may be the one @xcite referred to as being simply `` to the south '' of the pulsar .",
    "due to locations south_east _ of the pulsar but south_west _ of the crab s center of expansion , the proper motions of the three innermost knots ( s0 , s1 , & s2 ) would be expected to have either a strongly positive or negative right ascension term if moving away from the pulsar or the remnant s center of expansion respectively .",
    "that is , they ought to move toward the southeast if expanding away from the pulsar ( pa @xmath18 ) or toward the southwest if expanding away the crab s expansion center ( pa @xmath19 ) .",
    "in contrast , all seven northern knots would be expected to show proper motions toward the northwest regardless of their origin point , thus making them a less powerful discrimination test without highly accurate positional measurements .",
    "in addition , the innermost northern knot , n1 , lying just @xmath20 north of the pulsar , is a poorly defined feature and lies projected against a relatively bright filamentary background making precise positional measurements more difficult .",
    "table 2 lists the positions of the five southern knots ( relative to the central star just northeast of the pulsar ; star 16 of @xcite ) , our proper motion measurements , and with those cited by @xcite . within measurement",
    "uncertainites both data sets are in agreement .",
    "that is , although our estimated knot motions ( except for knot s1 ) are significantly smaller than those quoted by @xcite , they all lie within the macalpine et al.s relatively large error bar of @xmath11 yr@xmath5 .",
    "however , it is puzzling why @xcite concluded in favor of motions directed away from the pulsar with transverse velocities `` of order '' 900 km s@xmath5 based on their poorly constrained proper motion measurements .",
    "our east - west motions ( @xmath16y values ) of these five southern knots are more than an order of magnitude below the @xcite detection limit .",
    "but they are in line with simple radial motion away from the center of expansion like that experienced by other remnant filamentary features .",
    "a comparison of our knot proper motion estimates relative to the projected displacements of the knots from the center of expansion determine by @xcite is given in table 3 . here the average knot proper motions from the @xmath16x and @xmath16y displacements were calculated assuming these knots experienced the same acceleration as the general nebula leading to a derived explosion date @xmath6 a.d .",
    "1130 @xcite .",
    "as the table shows , our estimated knot proper motions are entirely consistent with the knots projected radial displacements from the crab s center of expansion .",
    "[ note the somewhat better agreement using the @xcite expansion center estimate . ]",
    "table 3 also lists the implied transverse velocities for the knots based on our proper motion estimates , knot radial velocities reported by @xcite , and the resulting space velocities .",
    "the five knots space velocities range from 440 and 740 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is on the low end of the remnant s @xmath21 km s@xmath5 filamentary expansion range @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , places their location well inside the remnant s filamentary shell and thus relatively close to the x - ray and uv bright synchrotron nebula .",
    "our proper motion estimates for all five knots indicate motions away from the remnant s expansion center and not the pulsar .",
    "specifically , the position angles ( pa ) for knots s0s2 are all @xmath22 180@xmath8 , consistent with expected motions from either trimble s or nugent s estimated expansion centers .",
    "this is in contrast to the expected pa values of around 152@xmath8 if these knots were moving away from the pulsar .",
    "our results are graphically shown in figure 2 where we plot the 100 yr proper motions of the five southern knots based on our measurements . as we found for the knots total proper motion values , our measurements are in somewhat better agreement with the @xcite expansion center than that of @xcite .",
    "as a qualitative test of our results , we registered the 1994/95 images with the 1999 images and then blinked them .",
    "we found the [ ar  iii ] knots motions to be visually consistent with radial motion away from the center of expansion as opposed to away from the pulsar , supporting our quantitative results .",
    "we conclude the kinematics of these knots did not appear to be unusual relative to other nebular features .",
    "we believe our derived knot proper motions to be more reliable than those of @xcite for several reasons .",
    "first , they used ground - based [ o  iii ] images with a much coarser pixel scale ( @xmath23 ) compared the _ hst _ wfpc-2 images ( @xmath24 ) and with much lower image quality ( @xmath25 seeing vs. wfpc-2 s fwhm of @xmath26 ) .",
    "second , their images covered just a 2.0 yr time span compared to our 5.66 yr ( 19941999 ) and 4.81 yr ( 19951999 ) time coverage .",
    "one criteria @xcite used to help identify [ ar  iii ] knots was a semi - stellar and/or isolated appearance on their ground - based images . when examined using the higher resolution wfpc-2 images , however , the knots described by @xcite show a broad range of morphologies and angular dimensions . in figure 3 , we show enlargements of magnified wfpc-2 images for several of these [ ar  iii ] knots . while many clearly do have a somewhat stellar appearance with diameters of @xmath6 @xmath27 , others appear fairly diffuse with diameters of up to @xmath28 ( e.g. , knots n1 , n6 & s3 )",
    ".    figure 3 also shows enlarged magnifications of nine other nebular knots ( labeled k1 ",
    "k9 ) with sizes and morphologies similar to the `` argoknots '' .",
    "one of these , k7 , was noted by @xcite as one of two other possible fainter and less distinct gas condensations .",
    "similar knots are found throughout the central part of the remnant ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) and often lie near the north and south arcs of [ ar  iii ] knots .",
    "the strong similarities in morphology of the [ ar iii ] knots to these other nebular knots , and the placement of these other knots around the n - s knot arc , suggests that the [ ar iii ] knots are not unusual remnant features .",
    "our study of the proper motions of five [ ar  iii ] bright knots using _ hst _ wfpc2 data from 1994 to 1999 show ordinary radial motions away from the nebula s center of expansion with magnitudes consistent with their projected radial displacement .",
    "the measurements indicate the knots are moving away from the remnant s expansion center and not the pulsar .",
    "in addition , the [ ar  iii ] knots do not appear to have unusual morphologies , and we have identified several other similarly appearing knots in the remnant .",
    "these results do not support the suggestion by @xcite that these knots might be moving rapidly away from the crab pulsar due to a collimated pulsar - driven wind or that these knots are unusual in appearance .",
    "on the other hand , the spectral data of @xcite clearly show they possess strong [ o  iii ] @xmath124959,5007 with unusually strong [ ar  iii ] and [ s  ii ] line emissions .",
    "macalpine et al .",
    "and @xcite noted a possible spatial association of the northern argo - knots with a filament at a higher radial velocity ( + 900 to + 1300 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the [ ar  iii ] bright knots were seen mainly at lower - intensity breaks in the filament s emission .",
    "they suggested that this might indicate that the material in the knots is derived from this filament possibly though some instability ( rayleigh - taylor or kelvin - helmholtz ) .",
    "magnetic rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the interface of this filament and the pulsar - generated synchrotron nebula as discussed by @xcite and @xcite might well explain the [ ar  iii ] knot morphologies .",
    "the tips of the rayleigh - taylor , finger - like filaments seen edge - on near the outer parts of the remnant ( e.g. , filaments f , g , & h ; @xcite ) show clumps of similar size and shape to the [ ar  iii ] knots .",
    "the only difference here may be the viewing angle , where the [ ar  iii ] knots are seen face - on .",
    "the observed difference in radial velocity between the coincident filament and the chain of [ ar  iii ] knot would be consistent with their more interior remnant positions .",
    "the estimated 440  740 km s@xmath5 space velocities for these knots , at the extreme low end for the crab s filaments , is also consistent with this picture .",
    "this would place them closer to the synchrotron nebula thus exposing them to higher x - ray and uv photoionization fluxes .",
    "this , in turn , might be the underlying cause for their strong [ ar  iii ] line emission via higher gas temperatures as suspected by @xcite .",
