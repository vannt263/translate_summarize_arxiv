    "dark energy ( de ) , the energy source that drives our universe accelerating , has remained a mystery since it was discovered in 1998 @xcite . the key feature of dark energy is encoded in its equation of state ( hereafter eos ) parameter @xmath2 , which is the ratio of its pressure to the energy density .",
    "the time dependence of eos can be used to classify a range of de models .",
    "the accumulating observational data , including observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , type - ia supernovae ( sn ) data @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) from galaxy surveys @xcite have set up strong constraints on the eos of dark energy .",
    "assuming the dark energy eos is a constant , then recent observation from _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) gives the constraint @xmath7 ( @xmath8 confidence level , _ _",
    "wmap__9+extra cmb data + bao+@xmath9 , @xcite ) , and observation from _",
    "satellite gives @xmath10 ( @xmath8 cl from _ _ planck__+@xmath9+_wmap _ polarization data , @xcite ) .",
    "however , allowing time evolution of @xmath2 , the results of constraints become comparatively looser . for example , parameterizing dark energy eos as @xmath11 then the constraints from _ _ wmap__9+extra cmb data + bao+sn+@xmath9 is @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath8 cl , see table  10 of @xcite ) , and from _ _ planck__+@xmath9+_wmap _ polarization data it is @xmath14 and @xmath15 at ( @xmath16 cl ) . therefore",
    ", the data slightly favor the model with @xmath17 and @xmath18 while large uncertainties of parameters still exist in the recent observational constraints .    in the spirit of exploring more phenomena associated with dark energy",
    ", we would like to investigate how the dark energy affects the growth of structure and clustering properties of galaxies .",
    "the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( hereafter ksz , or kinetic sz ) effect is one of the important phenomena that relates the galaxy s peculiar motion with the temperature fluctuations of the cmb .",
    "the effect can arise during two processes , i.e. consisting of the `` inhomogeneous patchy reionization '' and the post - reionization signals .    in models of inhomogeneous reionization ( or `` patchy reionization '' ) , where different regions of the universe were ionized at different times , the bulk motion of bubbles of free electrons around the uv emitting sources may cause the temperature anisotropy on the cmb @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the magnitude of the ksz power from patchy reionization is related to the duration of reionization .",
    "hence , one can set a constraint on the duration of reionization ( @xmath19 ) once the optical depth to reionization can be measured @xcite .",
    "after reionization , the `` secondary anisotropy '' of cmb can also be generated from the peculiar motion of galaxy clusters .",
    "thus by measuring the ksz effect one can have a good handle on the peculiar velocity of galaxies and therefore infer the growth rate of large scale structure .",
    "the growth rate of the large scale structure is affected by the dark energy eos , because the dark energy negative pressure can drive the accelerated expansion of the universe and therefore halt the growth of structure at late times .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to investigate the effect of dark energy on growth of structure and the `` imprint '' of dark energy on the ksz effect .",
    "this research is particularly useful since many ongoing cmb experiments , such as south pole telescope ( spt and sptpol @xcite ) and atacama cosmology telescope ( act and actpol @xcite ) are going to measure the ksz effect to a high precision .    the effect of clustering can be reflected in three different channels .",
    "first , the dark energy can freeze the growth of structure at late times , the larger the density is , the earlier it will take over the cosmic budget .",
    "thus by counting the number of galaxy clusters from sz effect one can set up constraints on the dark energy eos @xcite .",
    "since the thermal sz effect is sensitive to the structure growth rate , another channel is to measure the growth rate by cross - correlating the thermal sz effect with the galaxy clusters @xcite . finally , due to the change of the structures growth rate , dark energy",
    "can effectively change the power spectrum of ksz effect .",
    "thus by computing the ksz power spectrum , one can directly measure the effect of dark energy from different @xmath20s of ksz power spectrum .",
    "providing such an investigation on how much dark energy effect on ksz signal is the main aim of this paper .",
    "such detail modeling of post - reionization signal is particularly meaningful as more precise cmb observations are measuring the arcmin scale fluctuations .",
    "this is because once the astrophysics of post - reionization era is known better , it is possible to separate the post - reionization signal from the total signal , and thus obtain a reliable constraint on patchy reionization signal @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , complicated simulation tool is now developing to probe the physics of patchy reionization @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ksz_model ] .",
    "we provide an overview of the ksz effect , and describe our model of the ksz power spectrum , and discuss the baryon gaseous pressure and patchy reionization effect that may affect the shape and amplitude of power spectrum . in section  [ sec : dark_energy ] , we explore different phenomena of dark energy , by investigating how the different eos functions @xmath21 can affect the the structure growth function and power spectrum .",
    "then in section  [ sec : ksz_de ] , we put together the time evolution of dark energy and ksz models and investigate how the evolution of dark energy affect the 3d power spectrum of ksz and therefore affects its angular power spectrum .",
    "we then compare our theoretical calculation with the current observational constraints on ksz , and discuss its relation to patchy reionization signal .",
    "our conclusion is presented in the last section .    except",
    "when referring to specific models with particular parameters , throughout the paper we adopt a spatially flat , @xmath22cdm cosmology as our fiducial model with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",

    "while traveling from the last scattering surface to us , a fraction of cmb photons are rescattered by free electrons with a coherent motion of peculiar velocity along the line - of - sight .",

    "we choose the upper limit of the integral to be @xmath36 since we mainly focus on the kinetic sz effect after the reionization , which happens at @xmath37 in our fiducial cosmological model used in this analysis .",
    "later we will see that the exact ksz signal is not very sensitive to this upper limit as long as @xmath38 .",

    ", the continuity equation indicates that the fourier space velocity field ( @xmath66 ) is related to density field through @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the linear growth factor .",
    "therefore the peculiar velocity power spectrum and density - velocity cross - spectrum are related to the linear density power spectrum as @xcite , @xmath70 therefore eq .  ( [ eq : deltab2 ] ) becomes @xcite ) only holds in the models where the growth is scale - independent . for more general cases in which the growth is scale - dependent , _",

    "( [ eq : ksz - cls ] ) , one can obtain the power spectrum of kinetic sz effect , aka ostriker - vishniac effect ( hereafter ov effect ) @xcite , which corresponds to the case where the cmb photons are rescattered by linear structure of galaxy clusters through the linear velocity modes ( such as the bulk motion ) .",
    "on the other hand , the nonlinearity of the structure formation can affect the ksz power spectrum significantly on scales of @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the full ksz effect is determined by the non - linear matter density field @xmath76 cross - correlating with the linear velocity field .",
    "one can correct for the nonlinearity by replacing the linear matter power spectrum @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltab2-ov ] ) with non - linear matter power spectrum @xmath76 , @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 in addition , there is no need to replace linear velocity field with non - linear velocity field .",
    "this is because velocity power spectrum has an extra @xmath78 factor than the matter power spectrum , so there is more weight on larger scales than the matter power spectrum .",
    "therefore it turns out that this extra factor make the velocity field rather insensitive to the small scale non - linear behavior @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    ", we calculate the linear and non - linear matter power spectrum using the public code camb @xcite which automatically incorporates the halofit @xcite prescription for the non - linear matter power spectrum .          in the ksz power spectrum calculations",
    ", it is commonly assumed that the density distribution of the baryonic gas follows exactly that of dark matter , so there is no `` bias '' in between @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "however , on small scales , a significant fraction of baryons are in form of gas , thus the thermal pressure of baryons can erase the density fluctuations in the gas distribution on small scales @xcite .",
    "this `` suppression '' effect can be modeled as a window function @xmath81 such that @xcite , @xmath82 here we use the fitting formula of @xmath81 developed by @xcite , @xmath83^{7/2 } } \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : wl - simu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the filter scale @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this fitting formula is proved to provide a better fit to the gas density power spectrum than the analytic formula developed by @xcite through the comparison with `` bolshoinr and l60n '' numerical simulations shown in @xcite .",
    "thus , by incorporating the gas pressure window function , the power spectrum @xmath58 becomes @xcite , @xmath86 note that we assume that the velocity of gas follows exactly the velocity of dark matter , so there is no velocity bias between them .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksz - standard ] , we plot the ksz angular power spectrum and gas window function in panels  ( a ) and ( b ) respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksz - standard ] ( b ) , we can see that on the large scales , @xmath87 while on small scales @xmath88 as @xmath72 increases due to the gas thermal pressure force .",
    "the suppression is not very significant at the onset of the gravitational collapse ( high @xmath39 ) , but as structures gradually collapse , the suppression propagates progressively to larger and larger scales . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksz - standard ] ( a ) , we plot the ksz angular power spectrum @xmath89 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "one can see that the linear ov effect only produces the signal peaking at @xmath90 , and gradually decreases at higher @xmath20 .",
    "this is because the linear perturbation is sensitive to linear modes which are generically on large scales .",
    "one the other hand , using non - linear matter power spectrum instead ( eq .  ( [ eq : deltab2-nl ] ) ) to calculate the full ksz effect , one obtains the blue solid line , whose amplitude is about @xmath91 times higher than that of the linear one on small scales .",
    "the @xmath92 of the full ksz power spectrum is about @xmath93 on scales of @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , if we incorporate the window function to account for the fact that a fraction of density fluctuations will be suppressed by the gaseous pressure on small scales , _ i.e. _ to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltab2-nl2 ] ) , the total signal drops by a factor of @xmath95@xmath96 on @xmath97 to @xmath1 .",
    "in order to see clearly how dark energy affects the ksz signals , in the following analysis , we will adopt the full non - linear ksz effect without gas pressure as our default model , and discuss the effect of dark energy on this full - ksz signal .",
    "of - course , when using this model to compare with observations , one needs to consider the effect of gas pressure , which can only be well understood from numerical simulations .",
    "in this section we shall first review how the dark energy eos changes the comoving distance @xmath98 , and then show how the time - varying dark energy affects the structure growth , and eventually we analyze how the ksz power spectrum is affected by dark energy .",

    "[ fig : x - wz ] , we plot the dark energy eos in panel  ( b ) and the corresponding comoving distance at redshift @xmath39 in panel  ( a ) .",
    "one can see that the comoving distance increases as @xmath113 or @xmath5 drops and _ vice versa_. this is simply because a more negative @xmath113 or @xmath5 means a smaller hubble parameter in the past , thus a larger comoving distance .",
    "this is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - wz ] ( a ) .",
    "this brings up the question of degeneracy .",
    "if @xmath99 is more negative but @xmath100 is positive , this will produce the similar effect with a less negative @xmath99 but more negative @xmath100 .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - wz]a , we can see that the @xmath98 function for @xmath114 is very close to the model @xmath115 , and also close to the @xmath22cdm model ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) .",
    "this is because the comoving distance is an integrated effect , although the evolution of @xmath21 are different for these models , their integrated effects are close to each other .",
    "this degenerates between the time - evolving eos parameters is what we should be aware of when analyzing the ksz effect signals .      in the 3d power spectrum of ksz effect ( eq .

    "one can see that this ratio function is also close to a power law form , we therefore parameterize it as @xmath181 then we find that if allowing @xmath182 and @xmath183 related to a parameter @xmath184 , then the ratio function can be well approximated by ( by using the same fitting method as described above ) @xmath185 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ( b ) , we compare the numerical values of the ratio function by colour dots and its empirical relation ( [ eq : power - law2 ] ) and ( [ eq : bc-2 ] ) by black solid lines .",
    "we again find an excellent agreement between the two .",
    "therefore , our fitting formulae ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : power - law])([eq : bc-2 ] ) ) can be used for fast calculation of models with @xmath186 and @xmath180 . here ,",
    "we remind the reader that the scaling relation between @xmath187 and other cosmological parameters ( _ e.g. _ @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 ) is investigated in @xcite , so can also be used in fast numerical computation .",
    "we now discuss what current and future observational constraints can be obtained on the ksz power spectrum and its prospective to constrain dark energy . in @xcite , by using 148 ghz and 218 ghz atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) data and fitting the template with contribution from thermal and kinetic sz effects , infrared sources and radio sources , the @xmath8 level upper limit is found to be @xmath192 . in @xcite , the constraint on @xmath193",
    "is obtained by combining @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 ghz channel data of spt . by fitting the template of thermal sz with the kinetic sz signal , it is found that @xmath197 at @xmath8 cl .",
    "in addition , if considering the the correlation between thermal sz effect with cosmic infrared background , this upper limit is loosed to @xmath198 @xcite at @xmath8 cl .",
    "furthermore , by incorporating the bispectrum data from the same three channels of spt , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that the derived constraints on ksz amplitude at @xmath154 is @xmath199 at @xmath200 confidence level ( cl . ) , and @xmath201 at @xmath8 cl .",
    "we place these upper limits and data point in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dl2 ] .    by comparing the constraints from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we can see that although the constraints are not very strong at current situation , the spt constraint with bispectrum ( black data point on fig .  [ fig : dl2]b ) already tend to rule out the model with ( @xmath167 , @xmath202 ) .",
    "in addition , the trend of tightening constraints of ksz signal is quite obvious given many of the ongoing cmb surveys . in the future ,",
    "if we can place both upper and lower limit on ksz power spectrum , it can be used as a powerful tool to constrain eos of dark energy . in reality , _ herschel _ data can be used to separate the infrared and radio sources in the foreground , and thus improve the constraints on ksz signal .",
    "what we modeled above is the homogeneous ksz signal which comes from the era after reionization @xmath203 .",
    "the total signal of ksz consists of both homogeneous ksz signal and the patchy reionization signal with most of its contribution from reionization era .",
    "the magnitude of the ksz power from the second component , i.e. patchy reionization , is strongly related to the process of reionization @xcite , which detail is relatively unknown .",
    "for instance , it is unclear whether the reionization is an instantaneous reionization , or two - step reionization , or a double reionization @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is not clear how much contribution of the total ksz signal from the patchy reionization era .",
    "for example , if reionization started at @xmath204 and ended at @xmath140 , then it can generate roughly @xmath205 of patchy ksz power ( at @xmath157 ) , while the range @xmath206 $ ] would generate @xmath207 @xcite . therefore , in order to derive the patchy component of total ksz signal , it is very important to have a good theoretical modeling of the homogeneous ksz contribution as was laid out in this paper .",
    "the nature of dark energy is a mystery in modern cosmology , and its property is characterized by its equation of state ( eos ) parameter .",
    "current cmb space - mission such as _ wmap _ and _ planck _ , ground - based cmb experiments such as act and spt , as well as baryon acoustic oscillation experiments from sdss can set up tight constraints on @xmath2 parameter if assuming that @xmath2 is a constant",
    ". however , if allowing @xmath2 to vary , such as @xmath11 ( the cpl parametrization ) , the constraints become weaker while a large region of parameter space is allowed .    in this paper",
    "we have calculated the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich signal for general dark energy models with both the constant-@xmath2 case , and the cpl parametrization ( time - varying @xmath2 ) case .",
    "we first review the calculation of the ksz signal for the @xmath22cdm model , and extend the analysis for the general dark energy model .",
    "we calculate the curl momentum power spectrum @xmath143 at different redshifts , and find that dark energy can affect the amplitude and shape of the gravitational clustering at redshifts @xmath208 .",
    "finally , we integrate the curl momentum field from redshift @xmath111 till the reionization redshift @xmath36 , and find that if , for example , @xmath167 the total signal of ksz can be suppressed by a factor of @xmath209 on scales of @xmath154 , while @xmath168 the total signal of ksz can be enhanced by a factor of @xmath210 on the same scales .",
    "we then vary the parameter @xmath100 and find that this parameter is more sensitive to the amplitude and shape of the ksz signal , and in the range of @xmath211 ( @xmath200 constrained parameters space by _",
    "wmap_9+act+spt+bao+@xmath9 ) , the @xmath100 can alter the amplitude of ksz signal by nearly @xmath212 . therefore",
    ", if ksz signal can be precisely measured , it can be a sensitive test of dark energy .    finally , in order to fast calculate the ksz signal in a general dark energy model with a constant @xmath2 or a time - varying @xmath2 , we model an empirical relation which can precisely recover the values of ksz power spectrum from numerical calculation .",
    "our fitting formulae ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : power - law])-([eq : bc-2 ] ) ) work very precisely in a large region of parameter space ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) and therefore can be useful in the fast computation of @xmath213 .",
