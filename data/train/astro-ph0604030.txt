    "the open cluster ngc  6791 is currently believed to be one of the most massive , metal - rich and oldest stellar system .",

    "* ) , dependent on the adopted reddening and metallicity .",
    "estimates of the cluster reddening also cover some range , from e(b - v)=0.10 @xcite to e(b - v)=0.22 @xcite , with a mean value of e(b - v)=0.16 which is in excellent agreement with @xcite extinction maps , which gives e(b - v)=0.15 ( see   2 ) .",
    "ngc  6791 is a relatively distant cluster , with a suggested distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath8 ranging from 12.60 @xcite to 13.6 @xcite .",
    "ngc  6791 has also a peculiar white dwarf luminosity function , and the metallicity of the cluster has some bearing on the explanation of the wd properties @xcite .",

    "its most luminous stars are relatively faint and the combination of low effective temperature and high metallicity make high resolution optical spectra difficult to analyze .",
    "thus , metallicity estimates have been derived mainly using three different technique such as _ 1 ) _ photometric metallicity indicators @xcite ; _ 2 ) _ low- and moderate - resolution spectroscopy @xcite ; and _ 3 ) _ model isochrones ( * ? ? ?",

    "the first work at medium - high resolution is the one by @xcite , who measured a sample of warm hb stars at r=20,000 , finding an iron abundance [ fe / h]=+0.4@xmath90.1 , a modest ( if any ) @xmath10-enhancement ( within a factor of 2 ) , and about solar [ c / fe ] .",
    "very recently , two other spectroscopic studies on clump and red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , have been performed by @xcite and @xcite finding [ fe / h]=+0.39@xmath90.01 and [ fe / h]=+0.47@xmath90.04 , respectively .",

    "the use of ir spectroscopy offers an interesting alternative to optical spectroscopy , as it is less sensitive to the blanketing effects and more suitable to study cool and metal rich stars than the optical spectral range .",
    "our group has been undertaking a program using the nirspec spectrograph @xcite at keck to obtain spectra of old metal rich stars in the bulge field @xcite and globular clusters @xcite with the aim of studying the composition and chemical evolution of the bulge and globular clusters .",
    "precise chemical abundances of ngc  6791 are crucial to constrain better the age of this cluster , which deserves detailed investigations being one of the few examples in which we can study stars that formed very early in the evolution of the galactic disk . as underlined by @xcite ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) deviations from lte ( at a level of @xmath130.1  dex ) are mainly observed in stars which are significantly hotter and more metal poor than those in our program .",
    "the code is based on the molecular blanketed model atmospheres of @xcite in the 3000 - 4000  k temperature range and the atlas9 models for temperatures above 4000  k. since in the near ir the major source of continuum opacity is h@xmath14 with its minimum near 1.6 @xmath12 m , the dependence of the results on the choice of reasonable model atmospheres should not be critical",
    ". however , as a check , we also computed synthetic spectra using the more updated nextgen model atmospheres by @xcite and we compare them with those obtained using @xcite models , finding minor differences @xcite .",
    "three main compilations of atomic oscillator strengths are used : the kurucz database ( c.f . _",
    "http://cfa-www.harward.edu/amdata/ampdata/kurucz23/sekur.html_ ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "reference solar abundances are from @xcite . in the first iteration",
    ", we estimate stellar temperature from the @xmath15 colors ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) and the color - temperature transformation of @xcite specifically calibrated on globular cluster giants .",
    "gravity has been estimated from theoretical evolutionary tracks , according to the location of the stars on the rgb ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "for microturbulence velocity an average value @xmath16=2.0 km / s has been adopted .",
    "more stringent constraints on the stellar parameters are obtained by the simultaneous spectral fitting of the several co and oh molecular bands , which are very sensitive to temperature , gravity and microturbulence variations ( see figs .",

    "it is clearly seen that models with @xmath90.2  dex abundance variations give remarkably different molecular line profiles .",
    "temperature variations of @xmath9200  k and microturbulence variation of @xmath90.5  km / s mainly affects the oh lines , while gravity mainly affects the co lines . as a further check of the statistical significance of our best - fit solution , we also compute synthetic spectra with @xmath23200  k , @xmath260.5  dex and @xmath240.5  km  s@xmath25 , and with corresponding simultaneous variations of the c and o abundances ( on average , @xmath90.2  dex ) to reproduce the depth of the molecular features . as a figure of merit of the statistical test we adopt the difference between the model and the observed spectrum ( hereafter @xmath27 ) . in order to quantify systematic discrepancies ,",
    "this parameter is more powerful than the classical @xmath28 test , which is instead equally sensitive to _ random _ and _ systematic _ errors ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our best fit solutions always show @xmath2999% probability to be representative of the observed spectra , while spectral fitting solutions with abundance variations of @xmath90.2  dex , due to possible systematic uncertainties of @xmath9200  k in temperature , @xmath90.5  dex in gravity or @xmath300.5 km / s in microturbulence are statistical significant at 1 - 2@xmath18 level , only . hence , as a conservative estimate of the systematic error in the derived best - fit abundances , due to the residual uncertainty in the adopted stellar parameters , one can assume a value of @xmath31  dex .",
    "however , it must be noted that since the stellar features under consideration show a similar trend with variations in the stellar parameters , although with different sensitivities , _ relative _ abundances are less dependent on the adopted stellar parameters ( i.e. on the systematic errors ) and their values are well constrained down to @xmath320.1  dex ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "our derived iron abundance for ngc  6791 is in excellent agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite and only slightly lower than the @xcite ones .",
    "all these works suggest about 0.2  dex higher iron abundances than those obtained by @xcite from low - resolution spectroscopy ( [ fe / h]=+0.19  dex and [ fe / h]=+0.11  dex , respectively ) .",
    "hence , the high ( 2 - 3 times solar ) metallicity of ngc  6791 , now confirmed by 4 independent surveys at medium - high resolution in the optical and in the ir , strongly supports a 8 - 9 gyr age as derived from the main sequence _",
    "turn - off _ @xcite .",
    "our solar [ @xmath10/fe ] abundance ratio is in good agreement with the finding by @xcite for o , ca , ti , while their si and mg abundances are slightly higher .",
    "our [ c / fe ] abundance is a factor of 2 lower than the one by @xcite but in good agreement with the @xcite value of [ c / fe]=-0.2 .",
    "our and @xcite solar [ o / fe ] is twice the value found by @xcite .",
    "an overall solar [ @xmath10/fe ] is consistent with a standard disk chemical enrichment scenario where both sn  ii and sn  ia contributed to the enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "however , it is interesting that the iron abundance of ngc  6791 reached + 0.35 dex , more than a factor of two greater than solar , only a few gyrs after the first stars were formed , relatively early in the history of the galaxy .    in comparison with the galactic bulge , ngc",
    "6791 stars reach [ fe / h]=+0.35 , only 0.15 dex lower than the most metal rich bulge k giants reported by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-element abundances are distinctly lower than those seen in the bulge giants @xcite . in our sample of 11 bulge m giants observed with ir echelle spectroscopy @xcite",
    "we find [ fe / h ] between 1/3 and solar and enhanced [ @xmath10/fe ] abundance ratios as for k giants .",
    "the processes that enrich the bulge rapidly and early evidently require a star formation rate high enough to retain an alpha enhanced composition to nearly the solar metallicity ; this does not appear to have been the case for ngc  6791 .",
    "the age of the galactic bulge has been debated over the years , and ages as young as 8 - 9 gyr have been discussed seriously , especially when the luminous oh / ir stars are considered ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in terms of chemistry , there does appear to be a distinct difference between ngc  6791 and the bulge .",
    "the solar [ alpha / fe ] does not prove that ngc  6791 is younger than the bulge , but it does point to the cluster having formed well after sne  ia were able to contribute substantial iron to the interstellar medium .",
    "yet another population of disk stars with similarly high abundances are the metal rich dwarfs found in the disk @xcite .",
    "these dwarfs appear to have an inner disk origin and exhibit some alpha enhancement , and are therefore different from ngc  6791 .",
    "our results would appear to indicate that the enrichment of metals is not a monotonic process in galaxies . a proto milky way 4 - 5 gyr after the big bang had some disk regions with twice solar metallicity .",
    "our low @xmath33 indicates that extra - mixing processes due to _ cool bottom burning _",
    "are at work during the rgb evolution also at very high metallicity , confirming our findings for the metal rich giants in the galactic bulge ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
