    "the search for semiconductors exhibiting magnetism at room temperature has been long and unyielding .",
    "however , recently much progress has been made toward this goal@xcite . by doping a host semiconductor material with transition metal ferromagnetic atoms ,",
    "dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors have been produced with curie temperatures ( @xmath5 ) as high as @xmath6@xcite .",
    "hall effect measurements below @xmath5 showed evidence for carriers being spin polarized raising hopes for spintronics applications .",
    "specifically , metallic manganese ( mn ) was doped into gallium arsenide ( gaas ) whereby approximately @xmath7 of the carriers were spin polarized@xcite .",
    "we have reported the magnetic and transport properties of magnetic semiconductor films of tio@xmath0 , where @xmath8 indicates the degree of oxygen deficiency or defects in the film@xcite .",
    "the curie temperature , @xmath9 , was well above room temperature with a saturation magnetization of @xmath10 gauss .",
    "titanium dioxide , tio@xmath11 , is a well known wideband gap oxide semiconductor , belonging to the group iv - vi semiconductors , described in terms of an ionic model of ti@xmath12 and o@xmath13@xcite .",
    "its intriguing dielectric properties allow its use as gate insulator materials in the field - effect - transistor ( fet)@xcite . also , tio@xmath11 is characterized to be an n - type semiconductor with an energy gap varying in the range @xmath14 depending on sample preparation@xcite .",
    "films of tio@xmath0 on substrates of ( 100 ) lanthanum aluminate ( i.e. laalo@xmath15 ) were deposited by a pulsed laser - ablation - deposition ( lad ) technique at various oxygen chamber pressures ranging from 0.3 to 400 mtorr .",
    "the origin of the presence of ti@xmath16 and ti@xmath17 ( as well as ti@xmath12 ) ions was postulated as a result of the low oxygen chamber pressure during the films growth@xcite .",
    "oxygen defects gave rise to valence states of ti@xmath16 and ti@xmath17 ( in background of ti@xmath12 ) whereby double exchange between these sites dominated .",
    "the same carriers involved in double exchange also gave rise to impurity donor levels accounting for the transport properties of the film .",
    "the dilute number of carriers were spin polarized , yet the magnetic moment was still rather small@xcite.for example , normal hall resistivity was measured to be much bigger than any anomalous hall resistivity@xcite . in order to increase the anomalous contribution to the hall effect and thereby increase the number of spin polarized carriers , we have fabricated a layered structure of tio@xmath0/metallic iron ( fe ) .",
    "the intent was to introduce a substantial magnetization component internally to semiconductor tio@xmath0 .",
    "the basic difference between our layered composite and the previously reported magnetic semiconductors by others is that in our films the fe layers co - exist in a metallic state , whereas magnetic semiconductors prepared by others the transition metal co - exists as metal oxides and often oxide clusters@xcite .",
    "this major difference is important in terms of the magnetic and transport properties of the magnetic semiconductor presently produced by us and that of others@xcite .",
    "for example , metallic fe contains a significant higher moment and curie temperature than any other transition metal oxides .",
    "also , the presence of metallic fe allows for the creation of a reservoir of conduction electrons in the conduction band and , therefore , holes in tio@xmath0 layers . as electrons from the conduction band of tio@xmath0",
    "are thermally into the metallic fe conduction band , holes are created in tio@xmath0 much like in junctions of metal / semiconductor interfaces or in metal oxides semiconductor ( mos ) devices .",
    "conduction of holes occurs in tio@xmath0 layers .",
    "this mechanism gives rise to lower resistivity at high temperature in contrast to pure tio@xmath0 reported earlier@xcite where the carriers were only electrons .",
    "no such mechanism is possible in magnetic semiconductors doped with transition metal oxides .",
    "we report here that in our layered semiconductor of fe / tio@xmath0 the magnetization , @xmath18 , at room temperature , @xmath5 above @xmath19 , nearly @xmath7 of the carriers are spin polarized and the room temperature resistivity is lowered by as factor of @xmath20 relative to films of the undoped tio@xmath0 semiconductors previously produced@xcite .",
    "thin films consisting of alternating layers of granular iron ( fe ) and titanium dioxide ( tio2- ) were deposited by a pulsed laser ablation deposition ( lad ) technique from binary targets of tio2 and metallic iron ( fe ) on ( 100 ) lanthanum aluminate ( laalo3 ) substrates .",
    "we refer to this technique as the alternating targets lad ( or alt - lad)@xcite .",
    "alternate layers of granular fe and tio@xmath0 were deposited sequentially to produce films whose crystal structure was aimed to be similar to that of pure tio@xmath21 .",
    "targets of tio@xmath21 and fe were mounted on a target rotator driven by a servomotor and synchronized with the trigger of the pulsed excimer laser , @xmath22 = 248 nm . in each deposition cycle , the ratio of laser pulses incident upon the tio@xmath21 target to those upon the fe target was 6:1 .",
    "the substrate temperature , laser energy density , and pulse repetition rate were maintained at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and 1 hz , respectively .",
    "the deposition was carried out in a pure oxygen background of around 10 torr in order to induce defects in the tio@xmath21 host .",
    "there were a total of 4200 laser pulses ( 3600 pulses on tio2 target and 600 pulses on fe target ) for each film resulting in a thickness of approximately 200 nm as measured by a dek - tek 3 step profilometer .",
    "crystal and surface structure measurements were performed by x - ray diffractometer ( xrd ) and scanning - electron - microscopy ( sem ) . in order to measure the ratio of ti to fe , method of energy dispersion x - ray spectroscopy ( edxs ) within the sem column was employed .",
    "magnetic hysteresis loops and dc - electrical and magneto - resistivity of the resultting films were measured using a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) in the temperature range between @xmath25 and @xmath2 .     as a function of temperature , @xmath26 , for the layered granular fe in tio@xmath0 film ( dashed line ) and the pure tio@xmath0 ( solid line ) from the reference@xcite , scaledwidth=43.0% ]",
    "crystallographic properties of the at - lad films were measured using x - ray diffractometry ( xrd ) .",

    "the metallic fe phase was identified by the diffraction peaks appearing at 2@xmath31 and @xmath32 which are indexed to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 planes@xcite , respectively .",
    "fe@xmath21o@xmath1 peaks were also observed in the spectrum implying that the embedded granular fe was possibly partially oxidized .    for steady currents and with the magnetic intensity @xmath35 aligned normal to the film plane , the resistance matrix @xmath36 in the plane of the film may be written as@xcite @xmath37 wherein @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent , respectively , the normal - resistivity and the hall resistivity .",
    "a @xmath40 as a function of temperature for the layered film was measured in an applied field of @xmath41 and shown in fig.[resistivity ] .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath42 was quite small at high temperature . the @xmath42 behavior for pure tio@xmath0 film 10 ( solid line ) is also shown in fig.[resistivity ] exhibiting a typical metal - insulator transition in the temperature range of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath40 for pure tio@xmath0 , @xmath40 for the layered film is a factor of 1000 lower and is constant for temperatures between @xmath45 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath40 value at @xmath3 was measured to be 183 @xmath46@xmath47 , and is about a factor of 20 larger than the resistivity of pure fe@xcite .",

    "a common chemical potential energy or fermi energy in the layered film implies that the conduction band of tio@xmath0 layers is degenerate with the metallic fe conduction band .",
    "electrons hopping between ti@xmath16 and ti@xmath17 sites would find a conduit into the metallic conduction band whereby holes are created in the tio@xmath0 layers and therefore a small potential barrier at the interface .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig.[hallresistivity ] .",
    "since , the fe metallic particles are isolated or disconnected , conduction in the tio@xmath0 layers is via hole conduction . at very low temperatures , where thermal kinetic energy is not sufficient to raise conduction electrons into the conduction band of the fe particles , conduction is mostly due to electron carriers in tio@xmath0 layers . in fig.[hallresistivity ]",
    ", hall resistivity is plotted as a function of temperature . indeed , at high temperature carriers",
    "are holes and electrons for @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , the number of carriers relative to pure tio@xmath0 has increased by factor 1000 and the mass of holes is approximately about 10 times larger than the electron mass .",
    "effectively , the hall resistivity in the composite layered structure is decreased by a factor of 1000 relative to pure tio@xmath0 .",
    "the experimental data at @xmath3 shows @xmath51 for pure tio@xmath0 and @xmath52 for layered granular fe tio@xmath0 ( or approximately a factor of 630 smaller ) .",

    "the measurement was performed with an external dc - magnetic field of @xmath55 applied normal to the film plane ( out - of - plane measurement ) .",
    "the out - of - plane magnetic hysteresis loop behavior at @xmath56 is shown in the inset of fig.[magnetization ] .",
    "the film can be fully saturated with a field of @xmath55 , since the coercive field was measured to be @xmath57 .",
    "field cooled ( fc ) and zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) @xmath58 data in fig.[magnetization ] shows no difference which implies that no spin glass effects are present in the films .",
    "the magnetization ( @xmath59 ) of pure tio@xmath0 was measured to be about t@xmath60 gauss at @xmath44 which is considerably smaller than that measured for the fe / tio@xmath0 films .",
    "clearly , the measured magnetization of the layered films must be due to the presence of metallic fe .",
    "finally , we have measured an anomalous hall effect in magnetic field sweeps between -90 and @xmath61 as shown in fig.[hysteretichall ] .",
    "the film exhibited strong polarization and hysteresis behavior as a function of applied field at @xmath3 .",
    "since , the anomalous hall effects may be observed in the presence of a spontaneous magnetization@xcite we infer that about @xmath62 hole carriers are spin polarized .",
    "this polarized carrier density value is a factor of 1.2 larger than the carrier density estimated from normal hall measurement , where carrier density was estimated with only applied @xmath63 , at @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that nearly all of the carriers were spin polarized by the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "fig.[hysteretichall ] indicates that the carrier polarization is not affected by external field up to @xmath64 , which can be an advantage for memory device applications@xcite .",
    "magnetic and magneto - transport data for layered films of metallic iron ( fe ) and oxygen defected titanium oxide ( tio@xmath0 ) are reported in this letter .",
    "the essence of this paper showed that conduction carriers of the films were strongly coupled to residual magnetic moments of metallic iron ( fe ) layers in the layered structure .",
    "the dramatic reduction of normal resistivity ( @xmath42 ) of the films is a consequence of two factors : ( 1 ) oxygen defects in the tio@xmath0 layers induced electron hopping ; ( 2 ) electrons from the tio@xmath0 were into the conduction band of fe layers to create holes in tio@xmath0 similar to a metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) structure . as a result",
    "the number of carriers increased , and at room temperature , the majority carriers were holes with a density of @xmath65 as measured by normal hall measurements .",
    "the holes in tio@xmath0 were polarized due to the presence of ferromagnetic metallic fe , where the spin polarized density was measured to be @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , spintronics and spin dependent memory applications can be based upon the results presented here ."
