    "the study of difference equations ( des ) is an interesting and useful branch of discrete dynamical systems due to their variety of behaviors and ability to modelling phenomena of applied sciences ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the standard framework for this study is to consider iteration functions and sets of initial conditions in such a way that the values of the iterates belong to the domain of definition of the iteration function and therefore the solutions are always well defined .",
    "for example , in rational difference equations ( rdes ) a common hypothesis is to consider positive coefficients and initial conditions also positive , see @xcite .",
    "+ such kind of restrictions are also motivated by the use of de as applied models , where negative initial conditions and/or parameters are usually meaningless , @xcite . + but there is a recent interest to extend the known results to a new framework where initial conditions can be taken to be arbitrary real numbers and no restrictions are imposed to iteration functions .",
    "it is in this setting where appears the forbidden set of a de , the set of initial conditions for which after a finite number of iterates we reach a value outside the domain of definition of the iteration function .",
    "indeed , the central problem of the theory of des is reformulated in the following way : + _ given a de , to determine the good ( @xmath0 ) and forbidden ( @xmath1 ) sets of initial conditions . for points in the good set , to describe the dynamical properties of the solutions generated by them : boundedness , stability , periodicity , asymptotic behavior , etc . _",
    "+ in this paper we are interested in the first part of the former problem : how can the forbidden set of a given de of order @xmath2 be determined ? in the previous literature to describe such sets , when it is achieved , is usually interpreted as to be able to write a general term of a sequence of hypersurfaces in @xmath3 . but those cases are precisely the corresponding to de where it is also possible to give a general term for the solutions .",
    "unfortunately there are a little number of des with explicitly defined solutions .",
    "hence we claim that new qualitative perspectives must be assumed to deal with the above problem .",
    "therefore , the goals of this paper are the following : to organize several techniques used in the literature for the explicit determination of the forbidden set , revealing their resemblance in some cases and giving some hints about how they can be generalized .",
    "thus we get a long list of des with known forbidden set that can be used as a frame to deal with the more ambitious problem of describe the forbidden set of a general de .",
    "we review and introduce some methods to work also in that case . and finally we propose some future directions of research . + the paper is organized as follows : after some preliminaries , we review the riccati de , which is one of the few examples of de where the former explicit description is possible . as far as we know ,",
    "almost all the literature where the forbidden set is described using a general term includes some kind of semiconjugacy with a riccati de .",
    "des obtained via a change of variables or topological semiconjugacy are the topic of the rest of the section . in the following",
    "we will discuss how algebraic invariants can be used to transform a given equation into a riccati or linear one depending upon a parameter , and therefore determining its forbidden set .",
    "after we will deal with an example , found in @xcite , of description where the elements of the forbidden set are given recurrently but in explicit form .",
    "we introduce a symbolic description of complex and real points of @xmath1 in section [ sec : symbolic ] , whereupon in section [ sec : qualitative ] we study some additional ways to deal with the forbidden set without an explicit formula .",
    "we finalize with a list of open problems and conjectures .",
    "+ to avoid an overly exposition , we have omitted some topics as the study of systems of difference equations ( sdes ) , ( see @xcite ) , the use of normal forms ( see @xcite ) , the systematic study of forbidden sets in the globally periodic case and the importance of forbidden sets in lorenz maps .",
    "in this paper we deal with difference equations ( des ) and systems of difference equations ( sdes ) .",

    "to avoid degenerated or trival cases , some further restrictions must be imposed to @xmath9 .",
    "natural and common restrictions consist usually in regarding which is the domain of definition of the iteration map .",

    "it is implicitly assumed that @xmath42 .",
    "+ we remark that ( [ eq:1overx ] ) is also a de over @xmath43 , the projective line , and then @xmath44 being every solution 2-periodic if @xmath45 using the rules @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "+ analogously , the de @xmath48 has @xmath44 in @xmath49 , @xmath50 when ( [ eq:1overx^2 + 1 ] ) is taken over the complex field and @xmath36 is again empty in the projective plane @xmath51 . + in practical applications an undefined zero division means that the denominator belongs to certain neighbourhood of zero .",
    "therefore in de as @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 are real polynomials , the forbidden set problem could be studied using @xmath55 for a machine - value @xmath56 .",
    "+ in applied models where only positive values of the variables have practical meaning , @xmath9 could be @xmath57 .",

    "+ it is obvious that @xmath62 can be arbitrarily defined in @xmath69 ( without bilateral continuity ) and in that case @xmath44 . in the standard definition",
    "it is assumed that @xmath76 .",
    "+ lorenz maps are an important tool in the study of the lorenz differential equations and the lorenz attractor , and also in the computation of topological entropy in real discontinuous maps .",

    "+ in the following we deal mostly with des where iteration functions are quotients of polynomials , known as rational difference equations ( rdes ) .",
    "let s briefly recall some well known results about riccati des .",
    "let @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . a riccati de of order @xmath7 is @xmath79",
    "some special cases occur for particular values of the parameters . if @xmath80 , @xmath81 or @xmath82 the equation is linear , constant or globally of period @xmath83 respectively ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if none of those conditions stand , an affine change of variables transforms ( [ eq : riccatiorder1 ] ) into @xmath84 @xmath85 being the riccati number .",
    "finally @xmath86 leads to the linear de @xmath87 .",
    "the closed form solution of the linear de ables to write a closed form solution for ( [ eq : riccatiorder1_sf ] ) .",
    "moreover , there is a correspondence between the solutions of the linear de containing the zero element and the finite or forbidden set generated solutions of ( [ eq : riccatiorder1_sf ] ) .",
    "this is the idea behind the characterization of the fs of ( [ eq : riccatiorder1 ] ) that can be found , for example , in @xcite .    from a topological point of view",
    ", that characterization shows that @xmath36 is a convergent sequence or a dense set in @xmath49 or a finite set .",
    "moreover , in the last case equation ( [ eq : riccatiorder1_sf ] ) is globally periodic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ analogously , for the second order riccati de @xmath88 we can transform it into a linear one using the change of variables @xmath89 .",
    "the forbidden set is then described as ( see @xcite ) @xmath90 where coefficients @xmath91 depend on the roots of the characteristic equation . roughly speaking @xmath36 is a countable union of plane hyperbolas convergent to a limit curve in some cases , dense in open sets in other cases and even a finite collection when the de is globally periodic .",
    "+ our first proposal ( open problem [ op : qualitativedescriptionriccati ] ) is to clarify which kind of topological objects can be obtained in the riccati de of second order and to generalize to the riccati de of order @xmath2 @xmath92 we claim also ( conjecture [ conj : riccatigloballyperiodic ] ) that de ( [ eq : riccatiorderk ] ) is globally periodic if and only if @xmath36 is a finite collection of hypersurfaces in @xmath3 , generalizating what happens in the case of order 1 ( see @xcite ) .    to study the higher order riccati de see also @xcite . + in the former discussion , it was important to determine the set of initial conditions whose solutions in the linear equation included the zero element .",
    "this is called the zero set of the linear equation , @xmath93 .",
    "for example , in the riccati de of order @xmath7 , @xmath93 is defined as the set of points @xmath94 such that the solution of the linear de includes the zero element . but @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend on the initial condition @xmath97 of ( [ eq : riccatiorder1_sf ] ) via the change of variables @xmath86 .",
    "we can write the dependence as @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 can be expressed as @xmath100 generalizing to the riccati de of order @xmath2 ( [ eq : riccatiorderk ] ) , we get @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the terms of the associated linear equation of order @xmath103 .",
    "+ note that the semiconjugacy formula @xmath86 has zero as a pole .",
    "the forbidden can be regarded as the transformation of certain special set of the linear equation corresponding to the singularities of the semiconjugacy .",
