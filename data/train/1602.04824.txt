    "stellar yields are fundamental ingredients in chemical evolution models and simulations . to reproduce the chemical enrichment of galaxies over their entire lifetime , those yields need to include low - mass , intermediate - mass , and massive stars along with a wide range of metallicities , ideally from zero metallicity up to solar composition .",
    "several grids of stellar models are available in the literature with different numbers of masses and metallicities . in general , for massive stars , those grids either offer a limited number of masses within a certain range of metallicities ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a large number of masses for one specific metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we address the question of how many masses and metallicities for massive stars are required in a grid of stellar models to ensure convergence in galactic chemical evolution studies .",
    "to do so , we conduct an experiment with a set of yields which has seven masses from 13 to 30m@xmath1 and 15 metallicities ( see section  [ sect_yields ] ) , where we sample subsets of stellar models to create new sets of yields with lower mass and metallicity resolutions . we then fold those yields into simple stellar populations ( ssps ) and include them in a one - zone chemical evolution model to quantify the impact of the stellar grid resolution on our predictions . for now , we do not consider the impact of massive binary systems which could significantly alter the evolution and the ejecta of massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although our sensitivity study only focuses on massive stars , we included the contribution of low - and intermediate - mass stars and type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) in our calculations ( see section  [ sect_yields ] ) .",
    "+ it is generally believed that the most massive stars are more likely to form a black hole and lock away most of the heavy elements synthesized during their evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to be also supported by the lack of observed more massive progenitors for common supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this sustains the idea that there must be a transition mass above which massive stars stop to contribute to the chemical evolution of galaxies ( but see discussion in section  [ sect_yields ] ) .",
    "recent studies with high mass resolutions , however , suggest that such a transition may not exist and that black hole formation is in fact sparsely distributed across the stellar initial mass spectra , forming islands of non - explodability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the yields used in this work for massive stars have been calculated with four different remnant mass and black hole formation prescriptions , which enables us to study the impact of such prescriptions on our grid resolution study .",
    "as two extreme cases , we consider the prescription of @xcite that generates islands of non - explodability , and the _ no - cutoff _ prescription , which is a monotonic remnant mass distribution where all models explode with minimum fallback ( see figures  [ fig_remnant_high ] and [ fig_remnant_low ] ) .",
    "the remnant mass is the baryonic final mass of a star ( i.e. , not its gravitational mass ) and refers to its initial mass minus the total mass ejected during its lifetime , which includes the explosive ejecta , if any , and stellar winds . in our specific case , any remnant mass larger than  @xmath3m@xmath1 implies a black hole formation instead of an explosion .",
    "we also assumed that , if a star does not explode , the entire star disappears as a back hole and no supernova yield is produced . whereas this may be a simplification in some cases , e.g. , the formation of long - duration gamma - ray bursts or some types of hypernovae",
    ", it should be reasonable to assume that in this case the bulk , and in particular the inner parts of the stars , are not being ejected .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we compare our numerical predictions with observations to provide a visual reference to evaluate the importance of the stellar grid resolution in our simulations .",
    "we chose the milky way because of the large amount of stellar abundances data and because of the wide metallicity range covered by those data .",
    "although one - zone models do not capture the complexity of the formation of massive systems such as the milky way , we believe they are sufficient , at least as a first order approximation , to address the specific question of what is the impact of the stellar grid resolution and the remnant mass prescription in the context of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "our results may differ from the ones generated by two - zone and three - zone models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , since all of our stellar ejecta is returned and recycled in a unique gas reservoir instead of being distributed within the different galactic structures , such as the halo and the thick and thin discs .",
    "it is not our goal to produce the most realistic model of the milky way .",
    "more sophisticated simulations for our galaxy can be found in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    , using the @xcite ( upper and middle panels ) and the no - cutoff ( lower panel ) prescriptions .",
    "remnant masses larger than  @xmath3m@xmath1 implies the formation of a black hole .",

    "the mass of the gas reservoir , @xmath7 , is calculated by @xmath8\\delta t , \\label{eq_main}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the length of the timestep and the four terms in brackets are , from left to right , the inflow rate , the outflow rate , the stellar mass loss rate of all the ssps , and the star formation rate .",
    "the mass ejected by each ssp is calculated using the initial mass function of @xcite and the stellar yields described in section  [ sect_yields ] .",
    "we use a star formation history that has a similar shape than the one derived from the two - infall milky way model of @xcite , which we normalized to produce a current stellar mass of @xmath10m@xmath1 ( @xcite ) at the end of our simulations .",
    "the evolution of the galactic outflow rate is defined by ( @xcite ) @xmath11 to calculate the time evolution of @xmath12 , the mass - loading factor , we use the _ ma _ prescription described in @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total virial mass of the system .",
    "the redshift , @xmath15 , is converted into time using the cosmological parameters measured in @xcite , assuming the end of our simulations represents @xmath16 .",
    "we set @xmath17 to unity to consider outflows driven by radiative pressure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume the dark matter halo mass of the milky way follows the equations derived by @xcite which represents the average dark matter accretion rates extracted from the millennium simulations ( @xcite ) . in each series of simulations",
    ", we tune the final value of the mass - loading factor to ensure that the peak of the predicted metallicity distribution function occurs at [ fe / h ]  @xmath18 .      at every time @xmath6",
    ", we assume the star formation follows the kennicutt - schmidt law ( @xcite ) in the adapted form of ( @xcite ) @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the star formation efficiency and the star formation timescale .",
    "because @xmath22 is a known quantity in our code , we can reverse equation ( [ eq_sf_law ] ) and derive the evolution of the mass of gas as a function of time . the inflow rate , the only unknown in equation  ( [ eq_main ] ) ,",
    "can then be isolated and calculated for each timestep .",
    "this approach has been used in previous works to calculate the chemical evolution of local dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the star formation timescale is proportional to the dynamical timescale , @xmath23 , of the virialized system hosting the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) , and is defined by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the proportional constant and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the virial radius and the circular velocity of the system . with the relation for @xmath26 defined in @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the current hubble constant , the dynamical timescale",
    "is then given by @xmath30 with our set of equations , the @xmath31 ratio is used to control the initial and final mass of gas in our simulations .",
    "the initial mass of gas sets the speed and the concentration of the early enrichment and therefore the metallicity at which sne  ia start to contribute to the chemical evolution , whereas the final mass of gas sets the final metallicity and the fraction of gas converted into stars .",
    "we fixed @xmath32 to @xmath33 so that the final mass of gas in our simulated galaxy is @xmath34m@xmath1 , consistent with the current state of the milky way ( see table  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this represents a star formation efficiency of 0.04 when @xmath35 .",
    "this choice , however , implies a relatively low initial mass of gas and generates a fast early enrichment that pushes the appearance of sne  ia up to [ fe / h ] of @xmath36 , which is too high compared to the canonical value of @xmath37 constrained by observations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "to solve this issue , we introduced a free parameter , @xmath38 , in the exponent of the redshift dependency term of equation ( [ eq_tau_z ] ) so that the star formation timescale is now described by @xmath39 this assumes that the gas fraction in our galaxy model does not necessarily scale linearly with the dynamical timescale of the virialized system .",
    "it allows us to control the growth of the gas content and to tune the initial mass of gas independently of the final mass of gas to make sure that sne  ia occur at [ fe / h ]  @xmath40 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 depends on the choice of stellar yields and the amount of fe ejected by massive stars .",
    "we recall that our one - zone model is mostly designed to mimic the evolution of known galaxies rather than to study how that evolution is driven .",
    "although the @xmath38 parameter has been introduced for fine - tuning , we believe it is necessary in order to recover the global properties of the milky way with our simple model .",
    "it allows us to apply our chemical evolution calculations on top of a reasonable gas evolution pattern .          using the kepler stellar evolution , nucleosynthesis , and supernova code ( @xcite )",
    ", we computed a set of non - rotating stellar models and their nucleosynthesis yields with seven different initial masses ( see table  [ tab_sample ] ) and for 15 different metallicities of [ @xmath41 @xmath42 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.1 , 0.0 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , where @xmath4=\\mathrm{log}_{10}(z / z_\\odot)$ ] and @xmath5 . in this work , however , we do not include [ @xmath41  @xmath42  0.3 since our numerical predictions do not reach such high metallicity .",
    "initial abundances were taken from the galactic chemical history model of @xcite . during the hydrostatic burning phases ,",
    "mass loss is treated using the @xcite rate , taking into account the metallicity - dependence with a power law of exponent 0.5 .",
    "all models were exploded using a flat explosion energy of 1.2 b ( 1 b @xmath53erg ) for the final kinetic energy of the ejecta due to the lack of predictive power of current best supernova explosion models for the explosion energy in the mass range studied here . supernova fallback was obtained self - consistently using the 1d hydro of kepler .",
    "we also assume a _ standard _ amount of mixing during the supernova explosion as in which was adjusted to match supernova light curves ( @xcite ) .",
    "detail of this grid will be published in west & heger  ( in prep . ) ; the @xmath52 models are from @xcite .",
    ".mass and metallicity samples extracted from the original set of yields described in section  [ sect_yields ] .",
    "the nomenclature is used in all the figures presented in this study . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we then employed different criteria to determine whether a successful explosion would actually occur , based on different criteria in the literature for the _ explodiability _ given the pre - supernova structure of the star at onset of core collapse .",
    "the first simple case was to assume all stars explode . in this case , the entire non - fallback mass of all stars including winds contribute to the yields .",
    "next we explored different prescriptions for explodability based on formula readily available in the literature .",
    "we used the compactness parameter of @xcite , @xmath54 with @xmath55 and cut - off values of @xmath56 as suggested by @xcite and @xmath57 as suggested by @xcite , and the prescription by @xcite with the normalization to model s19.8 .",
    "when the criteria for black hole formation was fulfilled , we assumed the entire star would collapse to a black hole instead of producing supernova nucleosynthesis .",
    "only contribution from mass loss due to winds prior to collapse would be present in this case . in cases",
    "were no black hole is formed , the full yields as described at the beginning of this paragraph would be used .",
    "+ as we found that the prescription by @xcite is the most extreme in the sense that it makes the most black holes ( see figure  [ fig_2d_remnant ] ) , we only use this here for comparison . in the following , we skip the models using the more dated prescription of @xcite for the sake of clarity of the discussion .",
    "this prescription produced only some intermediate results compared to the two extreme cases considered in the present study .",
    "we combined these massive star yields with the low- and intermediate - mass models calculated by nugrid ( @xcite ; c. ritter et al . in prep . ) , which are available online .",
    "although we do not focus on elements significantly produced by those lower - mass models ( e.g. , carbon ) , we decided to include them to account for their contribution in the amount of hydrogen returned in the gas reservoir .",
    "the ejecta coming from sne  ia is calculated with the yields of @xcite assuming a delay - time distribution function in the form of a power law with an index of @xmath58 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more information about the treatment of stellar yields in our chemical evolution code .",
    "we deliberately do not consider the mass ejected by stars more massive than @xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "some of the yields used in our work possess islands of non - explodability , and we did not want to complement our set of yields with other models that do not show this feature , as they could bias and hide the importance those islands in our analysis .",
    "but , such massive stars can eject a significant amount of light elements during their pre - supernova evolution in the form of winds or eruptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and can therefore contribute to the chemical evolution , in spite of the slope of the stellar initial mass function .",
    "the predictions for the mass loss of the most massive stars are however rather uncertain ( e.g. , @xcite ) and possibly significantly affected by binary star evolution .",
    "for that reason , our numerical predictions are probably underestimating the abundances of certain elements such as o and mg .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , however , this is not a limitation because we are only interested in the differential changes due to assumptions in the mass and metallicity resolution of the yield grid .",
    "to provide a visual reference of the impact of the grid resolution of stellar yields , we compare our results with the stellar abundances observed in the milky way for o , na , mg , si , ca , ti , and mn .",
    "the data has been plotted using the stellab module , which stands for stellar abundances .",
    "this python code is also available online with the nugrid nupycee package .",
    "it uses a stellar abundances database and plot any abundance ratio for the milky way , sculptor , carina , fornax , and the large magellanic cloud .",
    "it should be stressed that the database is not curated and for now consist of a collection of data that has been blindly taken from the literature . for this work , however , we only took a sample of the entire stellab milky way database to provide a cleaner and more representative view of the global chemical evolution trends .",
    "although our data selection includes the galactic halo and thick and thin discs , we remind the reader that we use a one - zone model and do not consider those three components independently .    in our sample , there is no star duplication at [ fe / h ] above @xmath59 , as all data in this metallicity range come from only one source , which is either @xcite for o , na , mg , si , ca , and ti , or @xcite for mn . at lower [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the stellar abundances mostly come from @xcite and @xcite and may contain star duplications , except for o for which the data only come from @xcite .",
    "there is a lack of data around [ fe / h ]  @xmath60 in our selection .",
    "we could have complemented our selection with other studies like @xcite , but we decided to limit the amount of data to improve the clarify of our figures and to make the reading of our numerical predictions easier .",
    "this data gap should then be considered as a selection bias .    at low [ fe / h ] , o abundances have been derived using the [ ] @xmath616300 line along with a correction for 3d effects , while at high [ fe / h ] , o abundances have been derived using the @xmath617774 triplets along with a correction for nlte effects .",
    "we excluded carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars from the @xcite dataset to better isolate the global chemical evolution trends , which represent the best target for one - zone models .",
    "na abundances can significantly be affected by lte departure , especially at low [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because @xcite did not include nlte effects for na , we replaced those data by the nlte - corrected na abundances of @xcite .",

    "which stellar models were sampled from the original grid . as mentioned in section  [ sect_yields ] , the stellar yields at @xmath4=0.3 $ ]",
    "are not considered , since the final metallicity in our numerical predictions typically does not exceed [ fe / h]@xmath63 . with the _ 5 z _ and _ 6 z _ samples",
    ", we use the yields at @xmath4=0.1 $ ] when the composition of the galactic gas exceeds this metallicity .",
    "the adopted values for some of our key parameters as well as the final properties of our milky way models are given in table  [ tab_final_prop ] .",
    "our predicted metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , for the present choice of yields , is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ mdf ] and compared with the mdf we extracted from the apogee r12 dataset ( @xcite ) .",
    "we chose apogee to maximize the statistics without having star duplication . to broaden our mdf",
    ", we convolved it with gaussian functions using different values for the standard deviation parameter , @xmath64 . in our case",
    ", this serves to mimic non - uniform mixing and stochastic processes that are not included yet in our one - zone model .",
    "this convolution process has been used before ( e.g. , @xcite ) and shows that , with additional scatter , our predicted mdf could be in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "but our narrow raw mdf ( solid line in figure  [ mdf ] ) implies that our model currently does not capture the full complexity of the formation of the milky way , even if our model reproduces its current global properties ( see table  [ tab_final_prop ] ) . in particular ,",
    "our model is probably not suited to reproduce the early evolution of the galactic halo .",
    "but given the purpose of the present study , we still start our simulations with primordial gas in order to cover the metallicity range included in our stellar yields .",
    "figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] presents our predictions for six elements , relative to fe , against the stellar abundances observed in the milky way . for a given colour ,",
    "the different line styles illustrate the impact of using different mass samplings and resolutions . for a given line style ,",
    "the red and blue lines illustrate the impact of using different metallicity resolutions . with all the 14 metallicities sampled ( blue lines ) , this last figure shows that different mass samplings produce different results when the number of masses is reduced to four ( dashed and dot - dashed lines ) . at [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath2 , with the stellar yields used in this work , different selections of masses generate variations of about @xmath65  dex for o , mg , and ti , and @xmath66  dex for si and ca . at higher [ fe / h ] ,",
    "our predictions are less sensitive to the selection of masses as variations are generally found within 0.1  dex . within this [ fe / h ] range , ti and mn are relatively insensitive to the mass resolution .",
    "the variations seen at low [ fe / h ] also highlight the impact of the mass range considered in the yields . the mass sampling",
    "a and b ( see table  [ tab_sample ] ) include a maximum stellar mass of 25 and 30m@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "those massive star models , for the lowest metallicity included in the yields , are the first to enrich the galactic gas at early time .",
    "below [ fe / h ]  @xmath67 , the predictions generated by the mass sampling a and b ( dashed and dot - dashed lines in figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] ) therefore represent , respectively , the ejecta of the 25 and the 30m@xmath1 models .",
    "in fact , we made a test where we modified the mass sampling a to include both the 25 and the 30m@xmath1 models .",
    "in that case , for [ fe / h ] @xmath68 , the dashed lines in figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] became similar to the solid lines where all seven masses are sampled .",
    "however , above [ fe / h ] @xmath67 , the variations between the different mass resolutions and samplings remained unchanged .",
    "this shows how sensitive our numerical predictions at early time are to the selection of the first stellar models that participate in the enrichment process .     using the no - cutoff prescription for the remnant mass of massive stars .",
    "the lines and the observational data are the same as in figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res].,width=339 ]    @xmath69    reducing the number of metallicities does not produce any significant change in our numerical predictions , as shown by the red and blue lines in figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] . figure  [ o_na_mg_no_z_res ] presents an analogous of figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] but for the evolution of o and na relative to mg , as these three elements are all mainly produced during the pre - supernova phases .",
    "these predictions also converge toward the idea that the mass resolution and sampling are more important than the metallicity resolution .",
    "indeed , in the case of na , the different mass samplings generate more than 0.5  dex of variations at almost every [ mg / h ] value , whereas reducing the number of metallicities only produce variations of about 0.1  dex .",
    "we note that the variations seen for elements that do not match observations , such as na and ti , may not be representative , since we know stellar yields need to be examined in more details .",
    "however , we still decided to show these elements to highlight where improvements are needed in our stellar models .",
    "figure  [ x_fe_no ] shows the impact of using @xmath4=-2 $ ] instead of @xmath52 as the lower boundary of the metallicity range covered by our set of yields . because of the wide range of considered metallicities , our yields interpolation scheme between the sampled metallicities is done in the log space",
    "this , unfortunately , prevents us from including @xmath52 in the interpolation , as its logarithm value is not a finite number .",
    "therefore , when the zero - metallicity yields are included , we only use them for stars formed in primordial gas , and switch to @xmath4=-2 $ ] as soon as the gas gets enriched by the first stellar ejecta . in the case without the zero - metallicity yields , we use the @xmath4=-2 $ ] yields all the way until the metallicity of the gas actually reaches @xmath4=-2 $ ] , above which we interpolate between metallicities .",
    "+ when excluding the zero - metallicity yields ( black lines ) , the choice of the mass sampling has generally the biggest impact at [ fe / h ]  @xmath60 , as opposed to [ fe / h ]  @xmath70 in the case where the zero - metallicity yields are included ( red lines ) .",
    "this suggests that the lowest metallicity available in the yields plays a dominant role in the numerical predictions at low [ fe / h ] . as a matter of fact , depending on the mass sampling , including or not the zero - metallicity yields generally produces different results that do not converge before reaching [ fe / h ] of @xmath60 .",
    "the situation also occurs when looking at the evolution of o and na as a function of [ mg / h ] ( figure  [ fig_o_na_mg_no ] ) .",
    "the lowest [ fe / h ] and [ mg / h ] values of our numerical predictions correspond to the first timestep that includes chemical enrichment , and depend on the amount of fe and mg ejected by the most massive stellar model sampled in the set of yields , for the lowest metallicity .",
    "when excluding the zero - metallicity yields ( black lines ) , the relatively small variations at [ fe / h ]  @xmath68 , especially for o , mg , and si , are due to a similarity in the ejecta composition of the 25 and 30m@xmath1 models at @xmath4=-2 $ ] , which is the opposite in the models at @xmath52 .",
    "nugrid stellar yields currently include five metallicities ( @xmath71 , 0.01 , 0.006 , 0.001 , and 0.0001 ) and four models per metallicity for massive stars ( @xmath72 , 15 , 20 , and @xmath73m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the question that ignited the present study was whether nugrid should add more masses in their set of yields . to answer that question",
    ", we assumed that the current state of nugrid could be represented by the mass sampling a - 5  z sample ( see table  [ tab_sample ] ) with the no - cutoff remnant mass prescription , as nugrid does not for the moment consider islands of non - explodability .",
    "figure  [ x_fe_nugrid ] illustrates what would happen if seven masses were used instead of four .",
    "for this comparison , we did not start our simulations with primordial composition .",
    "as shown in the previous sections , numerical predictions are significantly affected by the choice of stellar yields associated with the first stellar ejecta . to eliminate this complication , and to only focus on the current metallicity range covered by nugrid",
    ", we started our simulations with the gas composition calculated in @xcite for @xmath74 .",
    "given this configuration , we conclude from figure  [ x_fe_nugrid ] that adding more masses is not a major concern for nugrid . but still , the ideal case would be to provide a finer grid that do not produce variations when a few models are removed from the set of yields .",
    "in this section we repeat the experiment made in the previous section , but using the set of yields generated with the remnant mass prescription of @xcite , which included islands of non - explodability .",
    "the adopted input parameters and our predicted mdf , for this choice of yields , are presented in table  [ tab_final_prop ] and in the lower panel of figure  [ mdf ] , respectively .",
    "the mdfs generated with our two remnant mass prescriptions are roughly similar .",
    "the minor differences are due to different fe ejection rates which are affected by the number of exploding models at a given time .",

    "the results with six and 14 metallicities are still indistinguishable . at [ fe / h ]",

    "@xmath36 , for mass sampling a , variations are generally between 0.05  dex and 0.15  dex , whereas almost no variation was seen with the no - cutoff prescription ( see figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] ) .    in the case of si , ca , and ti , the impact of the mass resolution at [ fe / h ]  @xmath68 is less important than with the no - cutoff prescription , as opposed to o and mg which now show variations ranging from 0.4  dex to 0.7  dex . at [ fe / h ] between @xmath59 and @xmath58 ,",
    "the impact of the mass sampling is increased by about 0.1  dex relative to figure  [ x_fe_no_z_res ] .",
    "these results suggest that the mass requirement in a set of stellar yields depends on the remnant mass prescription and reinforce our conclusion that the mass resolution is more important than the metallicity resolution .",
    "the first feature to notice in figure  [ x_fe_ertl ] is the importance of the mass sampling when only five masses and five metallicities between 0.000153 and 0.0193 are considered ( black dashed and black dash - dotted lines ) . with the stellar yields used in this work , this can generate variations up to @xmath77 dex for o and mg , and up to @xmath66 dex for si and ca across a larger [ fe / h ] interval than in the case with the no - cutoff prescription .",
    "ti and mn are still insensitive to the mass sampling and resolution . above [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath78 @xmath79 , all predictions are relatively insensitive to the mass resolution compared to the variations seen at low [ fe / h ] .",
    "when plotted relative to mg ( see figure  [ fig_o_na_mg_ertl ] ) , o shows variations up to 0.6  dex at [ mg / h ] below @xmath78  @xmath48 , whereas na shows variations up to 0.4  dex at [ mg / h ] above @xmath78  @xmath37 .",
    "+ these significant variations are explained by the upper panel of figure  [ remnant_2z ] . at @xmath4=-2 $ ]",
    ", the islands of non - explodability are regularly dispersed across the initial stellar mass . with the mass sampling",
    "a , the whole selection consists of non - exploding models , except for the @xmath80m@xmath1 model . on the other hand",
    ", the mass sampling b selects all the explosive models and misses the islands of non - explodability located at @xmath81m@xmath1 , @xmath82m@xmath1 , and @xmath73m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , when the stellar models at @xmath4=-2 $ ] are the first to enrich the primordial gas , the mass resolution is crucial .",
    "the situation is less extreme at @xmath52 ( see the lower panel of figure  [ remnant_2z ] ) .",
    "but still , in order to resolve the islands of non - explodability , the stellar models must be judiciously sampled .",
    "for example , one could have a representative selection without the @xmath81m@xmath1 and @xmath82m@xmath1 models , but not without the @xmath73m@xmath1 model .",
    "but with the remnant mass prescription of @xcite.,width=339 ]    .,width=339 ]    the different magnitudes of the impact of the mass sampling with and without the zero - metallicity yields , especially for si and ca , reinforces the idea that the lowest metallicity included in our set of stellar yields plays a major role in the numerical predictions at low [ fe / h ] . in this case , even when all the seven masses are considered ( solid lines ) , modifying the lowest metallicity available produces different results that do not converge before reaching [ fe / h ]  @xmath78  @xmath83 for o and si , [ fe / h ]  @xmath84 for mg , and [ fe / h ]  @xmath78  @xmath47 for ca .",
    "this is consistent with observations and simulations that show a rapid increase of the average metallicity at early time in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_1st_nonzero_z ] shows an analogous of figure  [ x_fe_ertl ] where we replaced @xmath4=-2 $ ] , the lowest non - zero metallicity in our fiducial case ( middle panels ) , by @xmath4=-3 $ ] ( lower panels ) and @xmath4=-1.5 $ ] ( upper panels ) .",
    "the predictions generated using the zero - metallicity yields ( red lines ) are still similar from one case to another below [ fe / h ]  @xmath84 , while variations between cases ( upper , middle , and lower panels ) can be seen between [ fe / h ]  @xmath60 and @xmath58 .",
    "when the zero - metallicity yields are not included ( black lines ) , variations can be seen up to [ fe / h ]  @xmath40 between the different cases , especially for ca .",
    "the black dashed lines are always flat and similar from one case to another since the mass sampling a only selects one explosive model at @xmath4=-3 $ ] , @xmath59 , and @xmath47 ( see figure  [ fig_2d_remnant ] ) .",
    "results shown in figure  [ fig_1st_nonzero_z ] indicate once more that , below [ fe / h ]  @xmath60 , our numerical predictions are sensitive to the first stellar models that enrich the galactic gas .",
    "however , we recall that we use a one - zone model that is not necessarily suited to reproduce the galactic halo , which is associated with the metallicity range where most of the variations occur . + it is worth remembering that the two sets of yields used in the present work have been calculated in the same way .",
    "the only ingredient responsible for the differences between figures  [ x_fe_no ] and [ x_fe_ertl ] is the remnant mass prescription , which suggests again that the mass resolution required in stellar yields depends on the remnant mass prescription used for massive stars .",
    "the stellar yields used in our experiment are not general .",
    "the fact that the extreme case of @xmath4=-2 $ ] is masked by the zero - metallicity yields ( see the comparison between the red and black lines in figure  [ x_fe_ertl ] ) does not mean the solution is to always use zero - metallicity yields . depending on the modeling assumptions , the stellar evolutionary code , and the physics included , other sets of yields could have different islands of explodability for their zero - metallicity models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in that case , the choice of the mass sampling could have different repercussions than the ones shown in this section for the cases including zero - metallicity yields .",
    "+ the variations seen in our figures illustrate the potential of our stellar yields to reproduce some of the observed scatter at low [ fe / h ] , especially for o , na , mg , si , and ca . in inhomogeneous - mixing chemical evolution models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the stellar initial mass function is randomly sampled , individual stellar models can transfer their ejecta into new generations of stars without being covered up by all other stellar models that would be contributing when the initial mass function is assumed to be fully sampled .",
    "the level of scatter should depends on the variety of abundance ratios seen in the ejecta of the adopted stellar models .",
    "we are currently working on a stochastic version of our chemical evolution codes to generate scatter in our predictions .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we used a single - zone model to address the question of how many masses and metallicities are needed in a grid of stellar yields in order to generate relevant and reliable predictions with chemical evolution models . using the set of stellar yields described in section  [ sect_yields ] , which has seven masses and 15 metallicities for massive stars , we performed experiments where we extracted a subset of models to evaluate the impact of the grid resolution on the chemical evolution of seven elements .",
    "as a visual reference , we compared our results with the stellar abundances observed in the milky way to better appreciate the variations between our results .",
    "our work suggests that there is no general answer to how many masses and metallicities are need for galactic chemical evolution applications .",
    "+ the mass resolution needed in stellar yields depends on the element considered and on the remnant mass prescription used for massive stars .",
    "we found that yields with a monotonic remnant mass distribution are generally more robust to modifications in the grid resolution .",
    "yields that possess islands of non - explodability are more vulnerable , however , as explosive or non - explosive mass regimes can be missed if not enough models are sampled .",
    "our results suggest that the yields from the lowest metallicity included in the grid can dominate the chemical evolution up to [ fe / h ]  @xmath60 . depending on the remnant mass distribution applied for the lowest metallicities , a bad mass sampling in the presence of islands of non - explodability can cause variations that exceed 0.5  dex ( see figures  [ x_fe_no ] and [ x_fe_ertl ] ) .",
    "the set of yields used in this work is not a general case and islands of non - explodability could be found at different mass regimes in other yields . under different stellar modeling assumptions",
    ", it is not excluded that extreme cases , such as the one at @xmath4=-2 $ ] with the @xcite prescription ( see figure  [ remnant_2z ] ) , could be associated with other lower - metallicity or zero - metallicity yields .",
    "we also studied the impact of the metallicity resolution and found that a wide range is more important than the number of metallicities .",
    "as for the mass resolution , yields with monotonic remnant masses are less affected by the metallicity resolution , reinforcing our conclusion that the grid resolution required in stellar yields depends on the remnant mass prescription and on the presence or absense of islands of non - explodability .",
    "similar results likely would be found for any major discontinuities in yields as a function of initial mass .",
