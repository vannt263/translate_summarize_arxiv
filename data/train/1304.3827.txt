    "the growth of actin networks is a generic propulsion mechanism occurring in a large variety of biological systems , ranging from the protruding lamellipodia of animal cells to the actin comet tails recruited by pathogens like the bacterium _",
    "listeria monocytogenes _ or the virus _ vaccinia _ within their host cells . due to its central importance , the molecular basis of this process",
    "is well preserved over a wide range of different species @xcite .",
    "although a large number of accessory proteins is known to be involved in actin dynamics on the cellular scale , in regions close to the leading edge the dynamics of network growth are determined by a small number of key reactions . here",
    "the interplay between three fundamental processes determines the structure of the growing network : polymerization of filamentous actin , branching mediated by the protein complex arp2/3 and binding of capping proteins to the filament tip preventing further growth @xcite .",
    "the fact that these processes are highly conserved is impressively demonstrated by the observation that many intracellular pathogens rely on them for efficient infection and spread in the cytoplasm of their hosts @xcite .",
    "even functionalized plastic beads , rods and discs as well as lipid vesicles and oil droplet in purified protein solutions containing this minimal set of molecules have been shown to be propelled _ in vitro _ by polymerizing actin networks @xcite .",
    "while the underlying molecular basis is very similar in all of these cases , the geometry of the different propelled objects is very different .",
    "for instance , the highly curved shape of relatively small , almost ellipsoidal pathogens like _ listeria monocytogenes _ or _ vaccinia _ virus is very different from the relatively flat shape of the leading edge of a crawling cells .",
    "the exact shape of the membrane in migrating cells is very dynamic , but certainly corrugated on different scales , thus in this case a flat obstacle shape can only be a first approximation and corrugated obstacle contours are also of large interest . in a growing actin network ,",
    "new filaments nucleate by branching off from existing mother filaments at a characteristic angle around @xmath2 set by the molecular geometry of the arp2/3-complex .",
    "importantly , branching can occur only close to the surface , as it depends on the presence of surface - bound nucleation promoting factors ( npf ) like wasp or acta @xcite .",
    "whether the daughter filament becomes a productive member of the growing actin gel depends on the way its direction is oriented relative to the direction of growth and how the object is shaped .",
    "therefore obstacle geometry is a crucial determinant of the resulting structural organization of the network .",
    "one essential function of growing actin networks is to generate force against external load .",
    "force - velocity relations for growing actin networks have been measured in different experimental setups and for various obstacle shapes @xcite .",
    "unexpected discrepancies in the results indicate that obstacle shape and the resulting difference in network organization also has an effect on force generation .",
    "modern electron tomography leads to visualization and analysis of filamentous actin networks in ever greater detail @xcite . while early electron microscopy data for the lamellipodia of fish keratocytes suggested a dendritic network of relatively short actin filaments @xcite , recent electron tomography data has revealed a more diverse structural organization , with relatively long filaments connected by few branch points into different and spatially extended filament subsets @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that the structural organization of the network strongly depends on the protrusion speed , with fast growing networks dominated by two symmetric diagonal filament orientations and slowly growing networks featuring more filaments in parallel and orthogonal to the leading edge @xcite .",
    "it is to be expected , that in the future the effect of obstacle geometry on network structure can be quantified by such methods as well .",
    "in order to achieve a complete understanding of the structure of growing actin networks , different modeling approaches have been developed during the last decade @xcite , ranging from microscopic ratchet models @xcite , rate equations for filament growth @xcite and large - scale computer simulations of filament ensembles @xcite to continuum theories of how elastic stress propels the obstacle @xcite and multi - scale models combining several of these model classes @xcite . from some of these studies it has emerged that one central quantity characterizing the structural organization of growing actin networks is the filament orientation distribution , which can be directly compared with experimental results @xcite .    in the following , we study a model which allows us to predict the filament orientation distribution as a function of obstacle geometry .",
    "our reference point will be stochastic computer simulations of growing actin networks incorporating the molecular processes of branching , capping and filament polymerization @xcite . for computational simplicity and deeper insight ,",
    "these will be compared to different versions of a rate equation model @xcite . for actin growth behind",
    "flat and laterally widely spread obstacles the steady state organization has been predicted earlier to be either a @xmath0 or @xmath1 degree filament orientation pattern , with mutually exclusive stability determined by the model parameters @xcite . in this paper , we will extend this analysis to also predict the effect of finite size and geometry of the propelled object .",
    "in particular , we will derive and validate a partial differential equation , which is valid also for curved obstacle shapes .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ modeling_strategy ] we introduce the model and explain how we analyze it . to validate our results , we compare different versions of a deterministic continuum model to stochastic computer simulations of filamentous networks .",
    "subsequently , the impact of different piecewise straight ( _ linear _ ) obstacle shapes on the resulting network orientation patterns is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ linear_obstacle_shape ] , while specific examples for curved ( _ nonlinear _ ) obstacle shapes are the subject of sec .",
    "[ nonlinear_obstacle_shape ] .",
    "our main result is that the competition between two fundamentally different network architectures persists for finite - sized , piecewise linear and curved obstacles .",
    "motivated by established biological observations , in our model we assume arp2/3 to nucleate daughter filaments from preexisting mother filaments at a characteristic relative branching angle around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the exact value varies with biological system and analysis methods ( for example , a recent value from electron tomography data for the lamellipodium of fibroblasts is @xmath3 @xcite ) , but is not essential for our theory .",
    "although the exact mechanism for the activation of arp2/3-mediated branching is not yet well established and subject of current research , it is generally accepted that arp2/3 is active only near the obstacle , where it is activated by nucleation promoting factors ( npfs ) such as the wiskott ",
    "aldrich syndrome protein ( wasp ) or the bacterial actin assembly - inducing protein ( acta ) @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in actin network architecture in close proximity to the surface of a propelled obstacle , we will focus on actin dynamics within the first few ten nanometers from the obstacle surface in which filament branching , capping and barbed end polymerization are expected to dominate actin dynamics , while filament depolymerization and decapping can be neglected @xcite .",
    "[ figure1](a ) sketches the geometrical arrangement studied here . the yellow _ branching region _ within a vertical distance @xmath4 from the obstacle surface indicates the domain in which filament bound arp2/3 is able to interact with npfs , which themselves are active only close to the surface .",
    "thus filament branching occurs in this branching region .",
    "once filament barbed ends have left this domain due to their retrograde flow they are not able to nucleate new daughter filaments anymore and will eventually be outgrown by the bulk network . as those filaments subsequently do not impact the orientation distribution at the leading edge ,",
    "we do not explicitly account for their further fate anymore .",
    "if the lateral extension @xmath5 of the obstacle is large compared to the width @xmath4 of the branching region , it is possible to neglect the process of filament barbed ends growing out of the branching region horizontally .",
    "however , for relatively small obstacles , for instance viral pathogens , the lateral dimension of the propelled particle @xmath5 can become comparable to its vertical extension @xmath6 and the finite lateral size of the branching region has to be taken into account .",
    "our main quantity of interest is the filament orientation angle @xmath7 relative to the surface normal .    in the following",
    ", we will validate our theoretical approach by comparing results from two complementary implementations , namely stochastic computer simulations and a rate equation approach , which have been introduced before for flat obstacles of large lateral size @xcite .",
    "motivated by the flat nature of the lamellipodium and also for computational simplicity , our modeling is restricted to two dimensions .",
    "representative snapshots of such simulations for flat and curved obstacle geometries are given in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "briefly , we simulate a network of infinitely stiff rods .",
    "this simplification is justified as the reaction kinetics that eventually determine the stable orientation distribution in steady state are active within a narrow branching region along the obstacle only . because filament segments spanning over this region are very short compared to their persistence length ( nanometers versus micrometers ) , local bending undulations are of minor importance here .",
    "the remainder of the filaments is considered to be entangled in the bulk actin network , which effectively acts as a base for the protruding filaments .",
    "however , filaments embedded in semidilute actin solutions have been found to exhibit substantial bending fluctuations in the past @xcite and therefore we effectively account for a finite uncertainty in filament orientation by incorporating a distribution of relative branching angles between mother and daughter filaments in the model as is discussed below .",
    "each uncapped filament is growing deterministically at its barbed end with a fixed velocity @xmath8 .",
    "thus we implicitly assume a constant density of actin monomers at the leading edge .",
    "polymerization is quantized such that filaments extent by one building block of length @xmath9 per unit time . apart from branching , individual filaments do not interact and hence the local filament density does not alter polymerization .",
    "filament barbed ends within the branching region close to the leading edge are possible candidates for stochastic branching and capping events .",
    "while capping is assumed to be a first order reaction in the number of actin barbed ends in the reaction zone , for branching we assume zeroth order .",
    "this is motivated by the expectation that the supply of activated arp2/3 is strongly limited by the availability of npfs at the leading edge and thus an effective zeroth order branching rate emerges for sufficiently high filament density or low capping rate @xcite . in the opposite limit of low filament density",
    ", the branching reaction is expected to become first order in the number of filaments ; this effectively yields an autocatalytic description @xcite , that is stationary only at one unique network growth velocity . therefore in this limit ,",
    "transitions in the filament orientation distribution are not accessible .",
    "however , it has been shown that both , first and zeroth order branching models , can be incorporated within a unified theoretical framework and that the crossover from one regime to the other does not have a direct impact on filament orientation in steady state @xcite .",
    "as actin networks in most experimental setups are growing against a finite load of the obstacle and non - constant force - velocity curves are observed , the zeroth order branching regime is expected to dominate the branching kinetics eventually .",
    "the orientation of new filament branches is chosen from a normalized linear combination of two gaussian probability distributions for the angle between mother and daughter filament with means at @xmath10 and standard deviation @xmath11 .",
    "red filaments in the illustration are actively growing , while blue filaments indicate capped barbed ends that neither branch nor polymerize anymore and will eventually be outgrown by the bulk network and leave the simulation box at the bottom . in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) the top boundary of the yellow branching region defines a rigid obstacle , which excludes volume and thus prevents polymerization above its boundary . as a consequence the fastest filaments which are growing in close to vertical direction",
    "are stalled by the obstacle .",
    "the vertical velocity of the obstacle is a parameter of the model and set to a constant value @xmath12 directly .",
    "this growth velocity should be regarded as the effective outcome in steady state , determined by the details of filament - obstacle interactions ( including regulation by biochemical factors ) .",
    "steady state growth is possible within the velocity range , @xmath13 . under these conditions a well defined filament number and orientation distribution evolves .    as a powerful analytical alternative to the stochastic framework introduced above",
    ", we also develop a deterministic rate equation for dendritic network growth based on earlier approaches of this kind @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the orientation distribution @xmath14 of uncapped filament barbed ends integrated over the whole branching region evolves in time by branching and capping events and by filaments growing out of the branching region .",
    "this translates into the following ordinary differential equation : @xmath15 here again , capping is assumed to be a first order reaction proportional to the number of existing filaments with the proportionality constant , a reaction rate @xmath16 .",
    "the probability of branching at a given angle is determined by the weighting factor distribution , @xmath17 , which is modeled as a linear combination of gaussians with maxima at branching angles @xmath10 between filaments and standard deviation @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath7 is the filament orientation angle measured relative to the vertical direction .",
    "the branching reaction is independent of the absolute number of existing filament barbed ends in this model ( i.e. a zeroth order reaction ) .",
    "hence , the branching rate @xmath19 is normalized by the total number of new filament ends , @xmath20 the reaction rate @xmath21 indicates the number of new branches per unit time .",
    "most importantly for the specific scope of this work , obstacle velocity and shape enter eq .",
    "( [ system_dgl_fiber_number ] ) via the outgrowth rate @xmath22 .",
    "as filaments are polymerizing with a constant velocity @xmath23 in their individual direction , some filaments will not be able to keep up with the moving obstacle and thus leave the branching region .",
    "the precise expression for the rate of outgrowth @xmath22 strongly depends on obstacle geometry and alters the resulting steady state orientation distributions as will be analyzed in detail in the following .",
    "we begin our analysis with linear obstacle shapes as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the obstacle ( and therefore the leading edge of the network ) moves with a constant velocity @xmath12 towards the top .",

    "the lateral obstacle width is indicated by @xmath24 .      for obstacles",
    "that are laterally widely extended , for instance the leading edge at the front of the lamellipodium in a migrating cell , we have @xmath25 and thus horizontal filament outgrowth can be neglected locally .",
    "mathematically , this means that we can use periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "this case has been analyzed before in a similar manner as done below for finite - sized and curved obstacles @xcite , and therefore we recapitulate the most important results as a reference case . in this simple case ,",
    "outgrowth of filaments from the branching region can only occur in negative normal direction .",
    "while the network grows with velocity @xmath12 in positive normal direction , single filaments grow with velocity @xmath23 in their individual direction .",
    "the projected polymerization velocity depends on the filament orientation , as @xmath26 filaments having a larger absolute orientation than the critical angle @xmath27 are thus not able to keep up with the speed of the obstacle and are subject to outgrowth with a rate @xmath28 the factor @xmath29 results from the assumption that new filaments branch - off from existing filaments on average in the center of the branching region of vertical width @xmath4 .",
