    "one can switch this to a formula for cohomology using universal coefficients , or via a minor rewriting of davis s original argument . in our case",
    "the formula is rather simple . since @xmath76 is abelian , each @xmath99",
    "is determined by the set of generators @xmath100 that are necessary to express @xmath101 . temporarily following davis s notation ,",

    "[ exmp : link ] we considered @xmath142 a simplicial arc , and two associated complexes , @xmath73 and @xmath80 .",
    "( the first claim of lemma  [ lem : puncturedcoho ] states that @xmath80 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath73 with the closed edge @xmath143 removed . )",

    "on the other hand , if @xmath1 is a single simplex @xmath9 , then @xmath9 only occurs in the summand corresponding to @xmath152 .",
    "all other simplices occur infinitely often , but if @xmath153 then @xmath154 is contractible , and @xmath155 is zero .",
    "thus @xmath156 , consistent with the fact that @xmath157 .    as was alluded to in the previous section , cohomology with group ring coefficients",
    "is closely related to asymptotic properties . a group @xmath23 that admits a finite @xmath158 is _",

    "it was from this perspective that brady and meier determined when a right angled artin group was @xmath159-acyclic at infinity .",
    "their approach was via a combinatorial morse theory argument using the @xmath34 complexes .",
    "however , there is an algebraic characterization that says a group @xmath23 is @xmath159-acyclic at infinity if and only if @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 is torsion - free ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it is important to remember that @xmath167 , and the formal dimension of @xmath168 is @xmath48 .      since @xmath8 is @xmath170-acyclic it follows by universal coefficients that its cohomology is trivial up to dimension @xmath171 and that @xmath172 is torsion - free .",
