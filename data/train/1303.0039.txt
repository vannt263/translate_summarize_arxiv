    "the boron atom acts as an electron acceptor : the resulting impurity potential is repulsive for electrons and the screening length is found to be of the order of a few angstroms ( the screening length  @xcite is defined as the distance from the charged impurity at which the surrounding mobile charges , rearranging under the electrostatic action of the impurity , reduce its potential by a factor equal to euler s number @xmath6 ) .",
    "the transport properties of `` quasi - metallic '' and semiconducting armchair gnrs ( following ref .",

    "hamiltonian , in the landauer - bttiker framework .",
    "@xcite boron impurities actually induce a strong hole backscattering , with much weaker effect on the electron side .",
    "a similar result was already obtained in boron - doped carbon nanotubes ,  @xcite and attributed to strong backscattering at the resonance energies of the quasibound states localized around the boron impurity . due to the lack of the rotational symmetry present in carbon nanotubes , in gnrs",
    "the energy of the conductance dip on the hole side depends on the position of the impurity with respect to the ribbon edge ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that these _ ab initio _ results can be fairly well reproduced with a simpler tight - binding model with a single orbital per carbon and boron atom .",
    "for each atom , the onsite energy is taken as the impurity potential extracted from the _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "the onsite energy of the boron atom is the only parameter that has to be adjusted in order to achieve the best match between tight - binding and _ ab initio",
    "_ transmission profiles .",
    "the success of such a simple tight - binding model in describing boron impurities originates from the preservation of the @xmath8 hybridization of graphene in the presence of substitutional boron .    by using this tight - binding model , transport studies in large armchair gnrs with a random distribution of boron atoms , with concentrations between @xmath9% and @xmath10% ,",
    "have been performed in ref .",
    "the addition of the transmission dips induced by all impurities leads to a _ mobility gap _ in the valence band , _",
    "i.e. _ an energy interval where conductance is nearly suppressed by scattering , while transport in the conduction band is preserved ( the opposite behavior would be found in the case of nitrogen doping ) . this occurs for semiconducting as well as for `` quasi - metallic '' gnrs , independently of ribbon width , as long as the potential can be assumed to be constant along the channel .",
    "the mobility gap increases with boron concentration and ribbon length .",
    "@xcite suggested a possible exploitation of this phenomenon to obtain field - effect transistors ( fet ) with wide gnrs ( @xmath11 nm ) , within the reach of conventional lithography .",
    "the absence of a significant bandgap in these ribbons could be compensated for by the mobility gap .",
    "however , the above mentioned study has been performed for ribbons without any gate - induced charge in the channel , since the impurity potential considered was the one extracted directly from an _ ab initio _ calculation without taking into account the effects of screening when a gate is applied .     and",
    "@xmath12 directions , to make the drawing clearer ) . ]    in order to simulate the behavior of a realistic transistor structure , we need to perform a self - consistent calculation to include the effects of an applied gate voltage and of a non - zero drain - source bias on the charge density .",
    "this can be done , at a reasonable level of computational complexity , with a tight - binding model set up with parameters properly extracted from the _ ab initio _ results .",
    "however , differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , the impurity potential obtained from _ ab initio _ approaches can not be directly used in a self - consistent simulation , since it would be overscreened , as a result of the poisson / schrdinger iterations .",
    "the approach chosen here is to mimic dft self - consistency with the tight - binding model and a proper distribution of fixed charges ; then the final impurity potential arises from the tight - binding poisson / schrdinger self - consistency .",
    "in particular , as we will detail in the methods section , the _ ab initio _ results can be reproduced considering a fixed charge @xmath13 ( where @xmath6 is the elementary charge ) in correspondence of each carbon atom , and using the following tight - binding representation : null onsite energies are considered in correspondence of all atoms , while , following ref .",
    "@xcite , the hopping parameter is equal to @xmath14 ev for all the pairs of nearest neighbor atoms , with the exception of the edge dimers , for which a value of @xmath15 is used instead .    to validate this approach , a self - consistent poisson / schrdinger calculation ( described in the methods section )",
    "is performed for an isolated graphene layer with a single impurity , as in the _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( inset ) , the obtained self - consistent potential around the impurity is very close to the _ ab initio _ result .",
    "also the _ ab initio _ transmission spectra are accurately reproduced for all positions of the impurity , keeping the boron onsite energy equal to zero and with no further parameter adjustment .",

    "the ribbon is surrounded by a double gate with a dielectric thickness of 1 nm , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the source - drain voltage and the fermi level are set to @xmath18 .",
    "the charge and potential on the ribbon adjust self - consistently as a function of the gate potential @xmath19 .",
    "first , the calculation was performed at @xmath20 with vacuum chosen as gate dielectric .",
    "the obtained potential is very close to the result discussed above for the neutral isolated ribbon .",
    "this gate configuration does not induce any significant additional screening .",
    "a more realistic model is obtained by considering a silicon dioxide dielectric between the gate plates and the ribbon , with relative dielectric permittivity @xmath21 .",
    "however , thin vacuum layers are kept just below and above the ribbon , with a thickness of @xmath22 nm , of the order of the calculated graphene / sio@xmath23 distance .",
    "@xcite the impurity potentials and the corresponding transmission spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for @xmath20 and @xmath24 v. screening is enhanced at a negative gate voltage , due to the accumulation of holes in the ribbon .",
    "this has a strong effect on transmission : the conductance dip is less pronounced and is shifted in energy , which could compromise the presence of a clear mobility gap in a transistor configuration .",
    "it was verified that the effect of the gates is much larger than that of the thin air layers , in terms of the global electrostatics , and , in particular , of the screening .",
    "this is the reason why in the runs for the evaluation of the transistor characteristics we will not introduce the air layers , that would make convergence of the poisson - schrdinger iterations much slower .     from the edge .",
    "the calculation was performed with silicon dioxide as gate dielectric and a thin vacuum layer surrounding the graphene sheet .",
    "inset : influence of the gate voltage on the impurity potential . ]    to assess the performance of complete boron - doped graphene transistors biased in a typical operating point , we have used the open - source code nanotcad vides .",
    "@xcite in this code , the 3d poisson equation is solved self - consistently with the schrdinger equation ( with open - boundary conditions ) , within the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism .",
    "@xcite schottky contacts have been modeled at the gnr ends with the phenomenological approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite , including self - energies that mimic metallic contacts .",
    "the considered device structure is reported in the inset of fig .",
    "the device is a double - gate fet and the channel is a 32-agnr ( 3.81  nm wide ) embedded in sio@xmath23 dielectric .",
    "this is consistent with typical nanofabrication techniques , in which the dielectric is deposited after the creation of the drain and source contacts .",
    "top and bottom field oxides are 1  nm thick , and the channel length is equal to 20  nm . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the transfer characteristics of the gnr - fet for a drain - source voltage @xmath25 = 0.1  v , for different boron doping concentrations ( defined as the ratio of the number of boron atoms to the total number of atoms in the channel ) .",

    "[ fig4 ] refer to a single distribution of dopants .    ) , for a given random distribution of the dopant atoms .",
    "the transfer characteristic for the undoped device is also reported . ]",
    "as expected , transfer characteristics for the undoped device are symmetric with respect to @xmath26  v. as soon as some boron doping is considered , the p - branch of the @xmath27-@xmath28 curve is suppressed , as previously observed also in carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite the p - branch suppression increases as the doping concentration is increased . from these results , it appears that with the considered boron doping concentrations , while still not obtaining a sufficient @xmath29 ratio for logic applications  @xcite with the considered 32-agnr ( which , however , having a `` quasi - metallic '' behavior in the absence of doping , represents , in this regard , a worst - case scenario ) , a clear onset of unipolarity occurs .",
    "increasing boron doping , while further reducing the current in the p - branch ( due to holes ) , also leads to a degradation of the device performance above threshold .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a)-(b ) , we show the transfer characteristics for 23 different distributions of doping atoms along the channel , for the same doping concentrations as in fig .",
    "the thick solid lines correspond to the average transfer characteristics computed over the considered statistics of the doping distribution .",
    "as can be seen , different doping distributions lead to a large dispersion of the transfer characteristics , which could be reduced if several nanoribbon devices were operated in parallel ( as can be necessary in some cases in order to increase the on current ) .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that the electron - hole asymmetry is clearly developing with chemical doping , and , based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be strengthened by increasing the gate length up to few hundreds of nanometers ( especially for the case with @xmath30 ) . indeed",
    ", longer channel lengths could result in cumulated contributions of multiple scattering effects and localization , which will even more inhomogeneously impact on transport characteristics ( as shown in equilibrium situations  @xcite ) . due to computational limitations",
    ", we are not reaching such channel lengths here .",
    "computational hurdles , in terms of difficulties in achieving self - consistence , also limit the doping level that can currently be simulated with our method to about 0.6% .",
    "thus , at present we can not handle the extremely high doping concentrations , of the order of 10% , that have been reached in a recent experiment  @xcite reporting unexpectedly large gap opening effects .",
    "in conclusion , by coupling a dft - based tight - binding parameterization ( validated _ via _ a multi - scale approach based on _ ab initio _ techniques ) with self - consistent negf quantum - mechanical transport simulations , we have found the onset of an electron / hole transport asymmetry and mobility gaps in boron - doped graphene nanoribbon transistors , confirming that chemical doping could serve as a way to shape the current - voltage characteristics of such devices .",
    "this is just a first step , because the achieved @xmath29 ratio , although for a worst - case condition , is still far too small for practical applications .",
    "there is however ample room for improvement and several different approaches could be used to selectively incorporate chemical entities into graphene , thus engineering separate chemically modified areas from a single graphene layer .",
    "a doping strategy could therefore be elaborated to implement pn junctions , logic gates and complex architectures directly patterned on the same underlying graphene layer .",
    "conventional state - of - the - art patterning methods , such as e - beam lithography , could be exploited to design superimposed material architectures ( with either metallic or other semiconducting materials ) onto the selectively doped and functionalized graphene - based substrates .",
    "although our transistor simulations have been performed for graphene nanoribbons with a width below 5  nm ( due to the otherwise prohibitive computational cost ) , we wish to point out that the scaling analysis detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite suggests that our main finding ( electron - hole transport asymmetry ) should be confirmed for ribbon widths above 10  nm , that is within the reach of conventional fabrication lithography techniques .",
    "finally , longer ribbon lengths and low temperature are also factors which are capable of widening the mobility gaps .",
    "the simulation approach is based on the observation that the dft results can be recovered performing a self - consistent poisson / schrdinger calculation , within the negf formalism , on the system , which is described using a tight - binding model and a proper distribution of fixed charges .    in detail , we found that , following this procedure , the tuning of a single parameter of the tight - binding model is sufficient to properly reproduce the _ ab initio _ impurity potential and transmission spectra .",
    "the method is inspired by what actually occurs in the dft calculation .",
    "the total charge of a carbon nucleus and of its core electrons is @xmath31 , while it is @xmath32 for boron . in the isolated atoms ,",
    "this charge is compensated by @xmath33 valence electrons for carbon and @xmath34 valence electrons for boron . in graphene",
    ", @xmath34 electrons per atom ( including , in the case of doped graphene , the boron atoms ) tend to hybridize in a `` @xmath8 '' fashion , while the remaining valence electron on each carbon lies on the `` @xmath35 '' bonding subband formed by the @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "also the @xmath5 orbital on the boron atom is not empty , since it tends to attract an electron from the neighboring carbon atoms , and this determines the shape of the impurity potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the single @xmath5 orbital tight - binding approach , the `` @xmath8 '' valence electrons",
    "are included in the global ionic charge of the atoms , which becomes @xmath13 for carbon and @xmath18 for boron .",
    "therefore this is the net charge `` localized '' on each atom that we have to sum to the negative charge of the @xmath5 atomic orbitals considered in the simulation . as far as the tight - binding parameters are concerned , the onsite energy for carbon atoms is @xmath18 , while the hopping energy between nearest neighbors is set to @xmath36 ev .",
    "the hopping energy of edge dimers is adjusted to @xmath37 in order to reproduce the small bandgap obtained in dft for `` quasi - metallic '' n - agnrs ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an integer ) .",
    "@xcite    only the onsite energy of boron may be further adjusted , performing a self - consistent poisson / schrdinger calculation for an isolated graphene ribbon with a single boron atom and comparing the obtained results with those deriving from the _ ab initio _ simulation of the same structure .    for the poisson equation",
    "the same boundary conditions are used in the _ ab initio _ and in the tight - binding calculations : neumann boundary conditions ( _ i.e. _ derivative of the potential energy , and thus electric field , constant and , in particular , zero ) in the longitudinal direction , at the ends of the nanoribbon , and periodic in the transverse direction , with a separation of 2  nm between the adjacent edges of nanoribbon replicas ( indeed , with a large enough separation between the replicas this is equivalent to a neumann boundary condition ) . the gate stack has been treated considering a constant permittivity , the one of silicon oxide , between the nanoribbon and each gate , where a dirichlet boundary condition is assumed . at each iteration ,",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are computed and the fermi level is adjusted to obtain charge neutrality . the local charge density is then calculated and the poisson equation is solved .",
    "the obtained electrostatic potential is subtracted from the onsite energies and the process is repeated until self - consistency is achieved . for all of the meshes tested in this work , it was possible to fit the _ ab initio _ data simply by adjusting the boron onsite energy .",
    "a typical choice was to spread the charge of each atom in a spatial region of half - width @xmath40 , the interatomic distance , and to choose a mesh interval of 0.1  nm , small enough to achieve convergence of the poisson solution .",
    "this charge repartition around each atom was defined using a smooth envelope function . in this case ,",
    "the best fitting was obtained for a value of the boron onsite energy of about zero , thus substantially coincident with that for carbon .",
