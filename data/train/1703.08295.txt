    "large - scale co surveys of the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of our galaxy have detected a peculiar population of molecular clouds , namely , high - velocity compact clouds ( hvccs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hvccs are characterized by their compact appearance ( @xmath3 pc ) and unusually large velocity width ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "some of energetic hvccs contain small expanding arcs and shells , indicating that local explosive events , such as supernova explosions , may be responsible for the origin of hvccs @xcite .",
    "however , a majority of hvccs do not have any expanding features or counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "co0.400.22 is such a featureless , energetic hvcc centered at @xmath5 .",
    "it has a small size ( @xmath6 pc ; figure [ fig:1]a ) and an extremely broad velocity width ( @xmath7 ; figure [ fig:1]b ) .",
    "intensive studies based on single - dish observations of molecular lines revealed that co0.400.22 consists of an intense component with a shallow velocity gradient and a less intense high - velocity wing .",
    "this behavior is interpreted as a gravitational kick to the molecular cloud caused by an invisible compact object with a mass of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this massive object could be an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) , which would contribute to the evolution of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the direction of co0.400.22",
    ", there is another molecular cloud at @xmath9  ( figure [ fig:1]b ) .",
    "this low - velocity cloud ( lv cloud ) is associated with a bright nebula of infrared emission , 22 ghz h@xmath0o maser emission , and 6.7 ghz ch@xmath10oh maser emission @xcite , indicating that massive star formation is taking place .",
    "its physical relation to co0.400.22 is unclear .",
    "if the lv cloud is physically associated with co0.400.22 , collision between these clouds with significantly different velocities induces intense shock , resulting in a broad velocity width feature , which bridges colliding clouds in the position - velocity space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to examine the cloud - cloud collision scenario for co0.400.22",
    ", the distance to the lv cloud should be determined directly .",
    "observations of h@xmath0o 6@xmath115@xmath12 ( 22.235080 ghz ) maser in h@xmath0o 359.620.25 were carried out in 12 epochs from november 2015 to january 2017 with vera .",
    "observational details are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the interval of the observations was @xmath13 1 month .",
    "all four stations of vera were utilized except for epochs 4 and 5 .",
    "h@xmath0o 359.620.25 and position reference source j17452820 @xmath14 were observed simultaneously in the dual - beam mode .",
    "the tracking center position of h@xmath0o 359.620.25 was set to @xmath15 .",
    "the separation angle between them was 105 .",
    "nrao530 was also observed as a bandpass and delay calibrator every 40 min .",
    "the observation sequence in each day spanned @xmath13 3 h.    cccc 1 & r15332a & 2015 nov 28 & mz , ir , og , is + 2 & r15360a & 2015 dec 26 & mz , ir , og , is + 3 & r16026b & 2016 jan 26 & mz , ir , og , is + 4 & r16061e & 2016 mar 1 & ir , og , is + 5 & r16084c & 2016 mar 24 & ir , og , is + 6 & r16114b & 2016 apr 23 & mz , ir , og , is + 7 & r16142b & 2016 may 21 & mz , ir , og , is + 8 & r16166a & 2016 jun 14 & mz , ir , og , is + 9 & r16236a & 2016 aug 23 & mz , ir , og , is + 10 & r16262a & 2016 sep 18 & mz , ir , og , is + 11 & r16327a & 2016 nov 22 & mz , ir , og , is + 12 & r17017a & 2017 jan 17 & mz , ir , og , is +    left - handed circular polarization was received , sampled with 2-bit quantization .",
    "the signals were filtered using the vera digital filter unit @xcite to obtain 16 if channels each with a bandwidth of 16 mhz .",
    "one if channel was assigned to h@xmath0o 359.620.25 and 15 if channels to j17452820 .",
    "the data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a rate of 1024 mbps .",
    "the system temperatures including atmospheric loss were measured to be 1001000 k , depending on the stations and weather conditions .",
    "correlation processing was conducted on the mizusawa software correlator at the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) .",
    "the correlator accumulation period was 1 s. for the j17452820 data , the spectral resolution was 64 points per each 16 mhz channel .",
    "for the h@xmath0o 359.620.25 data , the frequency resolution was 15.625 khz , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 0.21 .",
    "data reductions were performed by using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the amplitude was calibrated by the system noise temperatures , and bandpass calibration was made with the nrao530 data .",
    "the dual - beam phase - calibration data and the modified delay - tracking model were applied for accurate measurements . for phase - referencing",
    ", we calibrated the clock parameters using nrao530 and performed a fringe fitting on the maser spot in h@xmath0o 359.620.25 because of the low intensity of j17452820 ( @xmath13 70 mjy ) .",
    "the solutions were applied to the j17452820 data .",
    "we obtained the image of j17452820 by using task imagr .",
    "the position of j17452820 with respect to the h@xmath0o maser spot was determined by elliptical gaussian fitting to the brightness peak of the image .",
    "since the position of j17452820 should be stable , we can regard the positional change of j17452820 as that of the h@xmath0o maser spot .",
    "h@xmath0o 6@xmath115@xmath12 maser line was detected from h@xmath0o 359.620.25 at @xmath16  in the first eight epochs ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "only one spot ( named ` a ' ) was visible during epochs 15 , while another spot ( named ` b ' ) appears at @xmath17 northeast of spot a during epochs 68 ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we traced the position of spot a with respect to j17452820 .",
    "since spot b was more intense than a during epochs 68 , we traced it with respect to j17452820 .",
    "this was because we used the h@xmath0o 359.620.25 data for the fringe fitting process .",
    "for this reason , we added the positional offset between spots a and b to obtain the accurate position of spot a.    figure [ fig:4 ] shows the results of the position measurements of maser spot a. the position offsets are with respect to the average position of epochs 18 . as shown in figure [ fig:4 ] , we detected the movement of spot a , particularly in the r.a .",
    "plot , which certainly deviates from a linear motion .",
    "the deviation seems to be a sinusoidal , annual modulation .",
    "this must be due to the annual parallax of the maser spot .",
    "we derived the annual parallax and proper motions using both the r.a . and",
    "data simultaneously .",
    "table [ tab:2 ] summarizes the best - fitting result .",
    "the obtained annual parallax and proper motions are @xmath1 mas and @xmath18  for r.a . and @xmath19  for dec .",
    ", respectively .",
    "we employed a uniform weighting in the fitting procedure , because systematic errors are considerably larger than the statistical errors in the vlbi observations .",
    "we evaluated the systematic errors to be 0.16 mas in r.a . and 0.43 mas in dec . a worse astrometric accuracy in dec",
    "can be seen in low - elevation angle sources , such as galactic center sources , caused by an atmospheric zenith delay residual @xcite .",
    "the derived parallax corresponds to a distance of @xmath2 kpc from the sun .",
    "cccccc + 22.7 & @xmath1 & @xmath2 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 +",
    "the derived distance from the sun corresponds to a galactocentric distance of @xmath20 kpc if we assume @xmath21 kpc @xcite .",
    "this shows that h@xmath0o 359.620.25 , as well as the lv cloud , is not in the cmz . assuming the normal distribution of the observed parallax",
    ", we obtained the probability that h@xmath0o 359.620.25 is located further than 8 kpc to be 6.3% .",
    "thus , the lv cloud is not in the cmz with a confidence level of greater than 93.7% .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows the line - of - sight location of the lv cloud .",
    "the most likelihood value @xmath22 kpc falls on the scutum - crux arm . on the other hand",
    ", the velocity of the lv cloud ( @xmath23 ) implies that the lv cloud may belong to the 4 kpc molecular ring @xcite , which is also within the @xmath24 uncertainty range .",
    "the lv cloud could be a member of the ob association responsible for rcw 137 , which is a large ( diameter @xmath25 ) hii region centered at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "rcw 137 is visible in the optical wavelength , indicating a distance of @xmath27 kpc from the sun .",
    "all these facts support the near distance of the lv cloud .",
    "our parallax measurement of h@xmath0o 359.620.25 concludes that the lv cloud is in the galactic disk on the near side of the cmz . on the other hand",
    ", co0.400.22 is supposed to be in the cmz by its extraordinary broad velocity width .",
    "an absorption feature in co lines at @xmath28  @xcite indicates that co0.400.22 is certainly behind the 3 kpc expanding arm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lv cloud is irrelevant to co0.400.22 .",
    "the cloud - cloud collision scenario seems to be not applicable to the co0.400.22 case .",
    "we supposed another formation scenario for co0.400.22 , a gravitational kick by a massive , point - like object , which could be an imbh @xcite . in summary , this annual parallax study    we are grateful to all vera staff members for operation of the telescope and the data correlation .",
    "the data analysis was in part carried out on the open use data analysis computer system at the astronomy data center ( adc ) of the naoj .",
