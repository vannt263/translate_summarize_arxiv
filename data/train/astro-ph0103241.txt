    "the abundance pattern of metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 ( [ a / b]@xmath7 log@xmath8(a / b)@xmath9log@xmath8(a / b)@xmath10 ) provides us with very important information on the formation , evolution , and explosions of massive stars in the early evolution of the galaxy ( e.g. , wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 ; matteucci 2001 ) .",
    "those metal - poor stars may have been formed just a few generations after the first generation population ( pop ) iii stars or they may even represent the second generation ( see , e.g. , weiss , abel & hill 2000 for recent reviews ) .",
    "their abundance patterns may be the result of nucleosynthesis in even one single type ii supernova ( sn ii ) ( audouze & silk 1995 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ; nakamura et al .",
    "therefore comparisons with nucleosynthesis patterns in massive metal - poor stars may help constrain the explosion mechanism of sne ii , which is still quite uncertain , the initial mass function ( imf ) of pop iii stars , and the mixing of ejected material in the interstellar medium .    with the use of high resolution spectroscopic devices attached to large telescopes ,",
    "abundance measurements of extremely metal - poor stars have become possible ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; ryan et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the number and quality of the data is expected to increase with new large telescopes such as subaru and vlt .",
    "the observed abundances of metal - poor halo stars show quite interesting patterns .",
    "there are significant differences between the abundance patterns in the iron - peak elements below and above [ fe / h]@xmath11 . for",
    "[ fe / h]@xmath12 , the mean values of [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] decrease toward smaller metallicity , while [ co / fe ] increases .    for zn",
    ", early observations have shown that [ zn / fe]@xmath13 for [ fe / h ] @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( sneden , gratton , & crocker 1991 ) .",
    "recently primas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have suggested that [ zn / fe ] increases toward smaller metallicity as seen in figure 1 , and blake et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has one with [ zn / fe ] @xmath16 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath17 ( see ryan 2001 ) .",
    "these trends could be explained with sne ii nucleosynthesis , but progenitors and supernova explosion models are significantly constrained . in sne ii ,",
    "stellar material undergoes shock heating and the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "iron - peak elements including cr , mn , co , and zn are produced in two distinct regions , which are characterized by the peak temperature , @xmath18 , of the shocked material . for @xmath19k",
    ", material undergoes complete si burning whose products include co , zn , v , and some cr after radioactive decays . for @xmath20k @xmath21k ,",
    "incomplete si burning takes place and its after decay products include cr and mn ( e.g. , hashimoto , nomoto , shigeyama 1989 ; woosley & weaver 1995 , ww95 hereafter ; arnett 1996 ; thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto 1996 ) .",
    "we have discussed , using the progenitor models for solar metallicity ( nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) , that the decreasing trend of mn , cr and the increasing trend of co toward the lower metallicity can be explained simultaneously if the mass - cut that divides the ejecta and the compact remnant tends to be deeper for more massive core - collapse sne ( nakamura et al .",
    "this is because mn and cr are produced mainly in the incomplete explosive si - burning region , while co is produced in the deeper complete explosive si - burning region .",
    "the mass - cut is typically located somewhere close to the border of complete and incomplete si - burning regions .",
    "therefore , the deeper mass - cut leads to larger co / mn .    as for zn",
    ", its main production site has not been clearly identified .",
    "if it is mainly produced by s - processes , the abundance ratio [ zn / fe ] should decrease with [ fe / h ] .",
    "this is not consistent with the observations of [ zn / fe]@xmath13 for [ fe / h ] @xmath22 to @xmath15 and the increase in [ zn / fe ] toward lower metallicity for [ fe / h]@xmath12 .",
    "another possible site of zn production is explosive burning in sne ii .",
    "however , previous nucleosynthesis calculations in sne ii appears to predict too small zn / fe ratio ( ww95 ; thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in the application to the galactic chemical evolution model",
    ", it has been know that the fe yield of the ww95 model was too large , and thus only the fe yield ( not zn , etc ) has been reduced by a factor of three to better fit the observations ( timmes , woosley & weaver 1995 ; goswami & prantzos 2000 ) .",
    "this makes the [ zn / fe ] ratio larger , but still [ zn / fe]@xmath23 .",
    "also , this procedure is not justified if zn and fe are produced in the same site .",
    "hoffman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed another site for zn , i.e. , the neutrino - driven neutron star wind following the delayed explosion of a core - collapse sne .",
    "such a site have been considered for a r - process site ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the zn synthesis was found to be very sensitive to the wind condition such as neutron excess .",
    "understanding the origin of the variation in [ zn / fe ] is very important especially for studying the abundance of damped ly-@xmath24 systems ( dlas ) , because [ zn / fe ] @xmath25 is usually assumed , after the work by sneden et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , to determine their abundance pattern . in dlas",
    "super - solar [ zn / fe ] ratios have often been observed , but they have been explained by assuming dust depletion is larger for fe than for zn ( e.g. , lu et al 1996 ; pettini et al . 1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ; molaro et al .",
    "2000 ; hou , boissier , & prantzos 2001 ) however , recent observations ( primas et al . 2000 ; blake et al . 2001 ) suggest that the assumption [ zn / fe ] @xmath25 may not always be correct .    in this paper , using recently calculated presupernova models (  2 ; umeda & nomoto 2002 ; umeda et al .",
    "2000 ) we study the nucleosynthesis pattern of iron - peak elements , focusing on zn , in massive pop iii stars .",
    "we show that depending on stellar masses , mass - cuts , @xmath26 , is the electron mole number ; @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are respectively the atomic number , mass fraction and mass number for each species . with @xmath26 ,",
    "neutron excess is defined as @xmath29 . ] and explosion energies , large zn / fe can be achieved in the explosive nucleosynthesis yields of our sne ii models of pop iii stars (  3 , 4 ) . since zn and co are mainly produced in the same region , their enhancement , the reduction of mn and cr , and the near constancy of ni can be understood simultaneously with the same mechanism (  4 , 5 ) .",
    "we also discuss the reasons why previous models ( hashimoto et al . 1989 ; ww95 ; thielemann et al . 1996 ; nomoto et al .",
    "1997 ) underproduce zn (  4 ) .",
    "finally , we present the yields of the pair - instability supernova explosions of @xmath5 stars , and discuss that the abundance features of very metal - poor stars can not be explained by pair - instability supernovae (  5 , appendix ) .",
    "the elemental abundances in metal - poor halo stars may preserve nucleosynthesis patterns of the sn explosions of pop iii stars because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the imf of very metal - poor stars ( @xmath30 ) can be similar to pop iii stars , since the dominant cooling mechanism for interstellar matter is almost the same ( bhringer & hensler 1989 ) .",
    "second , the nucleosynthesis pattern in the explosions of very metal - poor pop ii stars ( @xmath31 ) are similar to those of pop iii supernovae ( umeda et al . 2000 ) . also a single sn event is likely to induce star formation for metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath32 to @xmath33 , so that the observed metal - poor stars can be the second or very early generation ( ryan et al .",
    "1996 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ; nakamura et al . 1999 ) .",
    "for these reasons , we use our pop iii ( metal - free ) models to compare their explosive nucleosynthesis with the observed abundances of very low - metal stars .",
    "we calculate the evolution of massive pop iii stars for a mass range of @xmath34 from pre - main sequence to type ii sn explosions .",
    "stellar evolution is calculated with a henyey - type stellar evolution code ( umeda et al .",
    "2000 ) , which runs a large nuclear reaction network with 240 isotopes to calculate detailed nucleosynthesis and nuclear energy generation . for the pop iii models we assumed no mass - loss .",
    "sn explosions are simulated with a piecewise parabolic method code .",
    "the detailed nucleosynthesis during the explosion is calculated by post - processing as in nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , using a code of hix & thielemann ( 1996 ) .    in the metal - free star evolution ,",
    "cno elements are absent during the early stage of hydrogen burning .",
    "therefore , the cno cycle does not operate initially and the star contracts until the central temperature rises sufficiently high for the 3@xmath24 reaction to produce @xmath35c with mass fraction @xmath36 . then pop iii stars undergo the cno cycle at a much higher central temperature ( @xmath37 k ) than metal - poor pop ii stars ( e.g. , ezer , & cameron 1971 ; castellani , chieffi , & tornamb 1983 ) . on the other hand , the late core evolution and the resultant fe core masses of pop iii stars are not significantly different from pop ii stars ( e.g. , ww95 ; limongi , chieffi , & straniero 1998 ; umeda et al .",
    "2000 ) . in table 1",
    ", we show the `` fe''-core masses of our model defined as a region with the electron mole number @xmath38 for various z and initial masses .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of neutron excess , @xmath39 , in the inner core at the beginning of collapse ( @xmath40 g @xmath41 ) .",
    "one of the major uncertainties in the calculations of stellar evolution is the treatment of convection .",
    "here we use the models calculated with relatively slow convective mixing ( @xmath42 in the parameter described in umeda et al .",
    "larger @xmath43 leads to stronger mixing of nuclear fuel , thus resulting in stronger convective shell - burning , which leads to smaller mass core and smaller mass compact remnants .",
    "we briefly summarize general nucleosynthesis of pop iii supernovae obtained in umeda et al .",
    ". the mass fraction ratio of odd- and even - z elements ( e.g. , al / mg ) , and the inverse ratio of @xmath24-elements and their isotopes ( e.g. @xmath44c/@xmath35c ) decrease for lower metallicity .",
    "however , the former ratios almost saturate for low metallicity ( @xmath45 ) and the latter ones are difficult to observe . therefore , the differences in the nucleosynthesis pattern between the very metal - poor pop ii and pop iii stars are difficult to observe",
    ". the abundance ratios among the even - z elements are almost independent of the metallicity .",
    "dependencies on the mass and explosion energy are more important .",
    "these results suggest that in discussing the abundance pattern of very metal - poor stars , effects other than the metallicity are likely to be more important .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the dependence of the production of zn and other iron - peak elements on the progenitor mass , mass - cut , and explosion energy separately . in order to clarify the site of zn synthesis in our models ,",
    "we first show in figure 3 , the ratio of the integrated pre - supernova yield divided by the post - explosion yield in our 20@xmath46 pop iii model ( @xmath47 erg ) = 1 ) .",
    "this indicates how much of each element is made by s - processes before explosion or explosive si burning .",
    "this figure shows that elements heavier than si are mostly synthesized in the explosion . in particular ,",
    "zn is almost entirely produced by explosive si burning .",
    "here we discuss the dependence of yields on the mass - cut , @xmath49 .",
    "the explosion energy is assumed to be @xmath50 .",
    "the abundance distribution for select species after explosion for 13 and 15 @xmath46 models is shown in figure 4 .",
    "also , in this figure , the regions for the complete and incomplete si - burnings are indicated .",
    "the upper bounds of the complete si - burning region and the incomplete si - burning region are defined by @xmath51ni ) = @xmath52 and @xmath53si ) = @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the labeled elements v , cr , mn , co and zn are the decay products of unstable @xmath55mn , @xmath56fe , @xmath57co , @xmath58cu , and @xmath59ge , respectively .    in the ejecta ,",
    "the mass fraction of the complete si burning products is larger if the mass - cut is deeper ( i.e. , @xmath48 is smaller ) .",
    "mn and cr are produced mainly in the incomplete explosive si - burning region , while co and zn are mainly produced in the deeper complete explosive si - burning region .",
    "therefore , if the mass - cut is deeper , the abundance ratios co / fe and zn / fe increase , while the ratios mn / fe and cr / fe decrease as seen in figure 5 .",
    "figure 5 shows that larger [ zn , co / fe ] and smaller [ cr , mn / fe ] can be achieved simultaneously for a smaller @xmath48 . in the 13 @xmath46 model for @xmath60 , for example",
    ", [ zn / fe ] is large enough to be consistent with the observed ratio [ zn / fe]@xmath61 for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath62 .",
    "more massive stars can also yield [ zn / fe]@xmath63 if the mass - cut is deep enough .",
    "the observed large ratio [ zn / fe]@xmath4 in very metal - poor stars can only be achieved with the combination of deep mass - cut and large explosion energy (  3.4 ) .",
    "another effect of the mass cut on the yield is the @xmath64ni mass in the ejecta @xmath65ni ) , which is larger for smaller @xmath48 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "ejection of the large amount of radioactive @xmath64ni has actually been seen in such bright supernovae as sne 1997ef and 1998bw ( e.g. , nomoto et al .",
    "we note that for @xmath66 , the @xmath65ni ) required to get [ zn / fe]@xmath4 appears to be too large to be compatible with observations of [ o / fe]@xmath67 in metal - poor stars .",
    "however , if fall - back of a large enough amount of iron - peak elements occurs after mixing , @xmath65ni ) can be smaller without changing the [ zn / fe ] ratio , as will be discussed in  3.5 .",
    "figure 5 shows that the relation between [ x / fe ] and @xmath65ni ) is sensitive to the progenitor mass . to understand this behavior ,",
    "we summarize in table 2 the location of the incomplete si - burning region in @xmath68 and @xmath65ni ) contained in this region for several models . the thickness in mass of the incomplete si - burning region ( and thus @xmath65ni ) there ) is larger for larger progenitor masses .",
    "suppose that all sne ii eject the same amount of @xmath64ni .",
    "then the fraction of complete si burning products is larger for less massive stars because the incomplete si - burning region is thinner .",
    "this is why the 13@xmath46 model yields larger [ zn , co / fe ] than more massive models if for example @xmath65ni ) = @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "models heavier than 15@xmath46 are consistent with very metal - poor star data if @xmath48 is small ( i.e. , @xmath65ni ) is large ) .",
    "the maximum values of [ x / fe ] as a function of @xmath48 also depend on the stellar mass because of the different density - temperature histories and @xmath26 distribution of the progenitors .",
    "there is a tendency that the maximum [ zn , co / fe ] decreases with increasing stellar mass .",
    "one of the reasons for this trend is that more massive stars have thicker incomplete si - burning region , and thus deeper material must be ejected to make [ zn , co / fe ] large . as discussed in the next subsection , in the deeper regions @xmath26 is typically smaller , which leads also to smaller zn and co mass fractions .",
    "on the other hand , there is no clear mass dependence for [ mn , cr / fe ] .      in order to see the dependence on @xmath26",
    ", we compare the post - explosive abundance distribution of the 25@xmath46 ( @xmath70=1 ) models in figure 6 . the left panel shows the original model , whose @xmath26 distribution is enlarged in figure 7 . in the right panel @xmath26",
    "is modified to be 0.5 at @xmath71 .",
    "as shown in these figures , zn and co abundances are very sensitive to @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath26 decreases below @xmath72 , the zn abundance becomes significantly smaller , because zn is the decay product of the symmetric species @xmath59ge .",
    "the dependence of the co abundance on @xmath26 is not monotonic but rather complicated , though the co abundance is larger in the @xmath73 model of this example .",
    "[ x(co ) is relatively large for @xmath73 .",
    "with lowering @xmath26 , it decreases once but increases again toward @xmath74 . ]",
    "previous progenitor models in nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) have much lower @xmath26 than our current models in the complete si - burning region because of the different initial metallicity and treatment of convection , and this is the main reason why those models significantly underproduce zn even for the 13@xmath46 model .    in our present progenitor models ( as well as in nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) ,",
    "we have applied electron - capture rates by fuller , fowler , & newman ( 1980 , 1982 ) . the use of the recent rates by langanke & martnez - pinedo ( 2000 ) , which are lower than those of fuller et al .",
    "( 1980 , 1982 ) would lead to larger @xmath26 ( heger et al .",
    "mezzacappa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and rampp & janka ( 2000 ) have recently performed simulations of sne ii with full boltzmann neutrino transports , and they have shown that @xmath26 in the deep layers may be enhanced up to @xmath75 0.5 by neutrino processes . in this case , zn production may be significantly enhanced over what has been calculated in previous models .",
    "we should note that @xmath76(zn ) can be large even if @xmath77 for energetic explosion as will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "recent observations suggest that at least some core collapse sne explode with large explosion energies , which may be called `` hypernovae '' ( e.g. , galama et al .",
    "1998 ; iwamoto et al . 1998 , 2000 ; nomoto et al .",
    "these sne likely originate from relatively massive sne ( @xmath78 ) .    in figure 8",
    "we show nucleosynthesis in the 25@xmath46 star with the explosion energy of @xmath79 erg . by comparing with figure 6",
    ", we find that for larger explosion energies , the boundaries of both the complete and incomplete si burning regions move outward in mass coordinates .",
    "we also find that for a larger explosion energy the incomplete si burning region is thicker in mass , thus containing a larger amount of @xmath64ni ( table 2 ) .",
    "so , we may expect that hypernova explosions , which eject a large amount of complete si burning products , also produce a larger amount of @xmath64ni than ordinary sne ii , unless significant fall - back takes place after mixing ( see  3.5 ) .",
    "this is seen in figure 9 , which shows that [ zn / fe ] @xmath80 only for @xmath65ni ) @xmath81 ( i.e. , very bright supernovae ) .",
    "the explosion energy also affects the local mass - fraction of elements . for more energetic explosions , the temperature during the explosion is higher for the same density ( nakamura et al .",
    "figures 6 and 8 show that for a higher energy @xmath76(co ) and @xmath76(zn ) are enhanced in complete - si burning and @xmath76(mn ) is reduced in incomplete - si burning .",
    "@xmath76(cr ) in incomplete - si burning is almost unchanged .    in order to show the parameter dependences of @xmath76(zn ) , we plot in figure [ fig9 ] the density - temperature track during explosive complete si - burning for four representative cases following the maximum temperature ( open circles ) .",
    "the parameters of the four models and the mass fractions of @xmath64ni and zn are summarized in table 3 .",
    "cases b & d produce large @xmath76(zn ) , while a & c are the cases with smaller @xmath76(zn ) .",
    "case c@xmath82 is the same as case c except for the modifications of @xmath26 .",
    "the general trend is that @xmath76(zn ) is larger if @xmath26 is closer to 0.5 and an explosion is more energetic to produce larger specific radiation entropy @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the radiation constant .",
    "cases a and c have low @xmath76(zn ) because of relatively low @xmath26 .",
    "case c@xmath82 has the same density - temperature history as case c , but it yields larger @xmath76(zn ) due to the larger @xmath26 .",
    "case d has the same @xmath26 as case c , but it yields larger @xmath76(zn ) due to larger @xmath85 . case b yields large @xmath76(zn ) because of the relatively large @xmath26 and @xmath85 .    in figures [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] ,",
    "we show the time evolution of density , temperature , @xmath85 , and mass fraction ratios of some elements that are relevant to zn synthesis for cases c ( c@xmath82 ) and d. these figures show that for larger @xmath85 the mass fraction of @xmath86he is larger and thus the @xmath24-rich freezout is enhanced .",
    "then the larger fractions of @xmath64ni and @xmath87zn are converted to @xmath59ge , which enhances the zn mass fraction .",
    "we note that the trend that large @xmath88 gives high @xmath85 during an @xmath24-rich freezeout can be further enhanced in non - spherical explosions .",
    "this is because the shock in the jet - direction is stronger than the shock in the spherical model with the same @xmath88 ( e.g. , maeda et al .",
    "2002 ; nagataki et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we have shown that large [ zn , co / fe ] and small [ mn , cr / fe ] can be obtained simultaneously if @xmath48 is sufficiently small . however",
    ", the ejected @xmath64ni mass is larger for smaller @xmath89 , and @xmath65ni ) required to get [ zn / fe]@xmath4 appears to be too large to be compatible with observations [ o / fe]@xmath90 .",
    "here we consider a possible process that realizes effectively smaller mass - cuts without changing the @xmath64ni mass . in sne ii ,",
    "when the rapidly expanding core hits the h and he envelopes , a reverse shock forms and decelerates core expansion .",
    "the deceleration induces rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the composition interfaces of h / he , he / c+o , and o / si as has been found in sn 1987a ( e.g. , ebisuzaki , shigeyama , & nomoto 1989 ; arnett et al . 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , mixing can take place between the complete and incomplete si burning regions according to the recent two dimensional numerical simulations ( kifonidis et al .",
    "2000 ; kifonidis 2001 ) .",
    "the reverse shock can further induce matter fall - back onto the compact remnant ( e.g. , chevalier 1989 ) .",
    "based on these earlier findings , we propose that the following `` mixing fall - back '' process takes place in most sne ii .",

    "otherwise , zn and co are underproduced , or too much @xmath64ni is ejected as also seen in previous works such as nakamura et al .",

    "kifonidis et al . 2000 ) , but the fall - back simulations has been done only in 1d ( ww95 ) .",
    "therefore , we need multi - d simulations of fall - back to confirm the occurrence of the `` mixing and fall - back '' process and the resulting modification of the ejecta composition , which has not been done . only when the mixing takes place across the `` final mass - cut '' , the sn yields are modified by the mixing , which has not been taken into account in previous sn yields .    this `` mixing and fall - back '' effect",

    "thus [ zn / fe ] tends to be larger for less massive stars for the same @xmath88 (  3.2 ) .",
    "\\3 ) the production of zn and co is sensitive to the value of @xmath26 , being larger as @xmath26 is closer to 0.5 , especially for the case of a normal explosion energy ( @xmath102 ) (  3.3 ) .",
    "\\4 ) a large explosion energy @xmath88 results in the enhancement of the local mass fractions of zn and co , while cr and mn are not enhanced ( fig . 9 ) .",
    "this is because larger @xmath88 produces larger entropy and thus a stronger @xmath24-rich freeze - out (  3.4 ) .",
    "\\5 ) to be consistent with the observed [ o / fe ] @xmath75 0 - 0.5 as well as with [ zn / fe ] @xmath75 0.5 in metal - poor stars , we propose that the  mixing and fall - back \" process or aspherical effects are significant in the explosion of relatively massive stars (  3.5 ) .      the dependence of [ zn / fe ] on @xmath101 and @xmath88 is summarized in figures 13 and 14 as follows .",
    "\\a ) in figure 13 , we compare the [ zn / fe ] ratios in our @xmath103 models with previous models for various progenitor masses @xmath101 .",
    "the [ zn / fe ] ratio depends also on @xmath91 , and our values in figure [ fig12 ] correspond to the maximum values for @xmath104 .",
    "the difference in @xmath26 is the primary reason why zn production is much smaller when previous progenitor models by nomoto & hashimoto ( 1998 ) are used ( thielemann et al .",
    "( note that , for hypernova - like explosion energies , zn is abundantly produced even if @xmath26 is smaller while zn production is suppressed otherwise . )",
    "differences from ww95 likely stem from the differences in @xmath97 .",
    "limongi , straniero & chieffi ( 2000 ) has also shown their yields for some z = 0 models . however , their nuclear reaction network is not large enough to calculate @xmath59zn synthesis ( limongi 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "\\b ) in figure 14 , [ zn / fe ] is shown as a function of @xmath101 and @xmath88 , where the plotted ratios correspond to the maximum values for given @xmath88 .",
    "we have found that models with @xmath105 1 do not produce sufficiently large [ zn / fe ] . to be compatible with the observations of [ zn / fe ] @xmath4 , the explosion energy must be much larger , i.e. , @xmath0 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "observationally , the requirement of the large @xmath88 might suggest that large @xmath101 stars are responsible for large [ zn / fe ] , because @xmath88 and @xmath101 can be constrained from the observed brightness and light curve shape of supernovae as follows .",
    "[ the uncertainties in theoretical models for gravitational collapse are still too large to determine @xmath88 ( e.g. , mezzacappa et al . 2000 ; rampp and janka 2000 ) . ]",
    "the recent supernovae 1987a , 1993j , and 1994i indicate that the progenitors of these normal sne are 13 - 20 @xmath46 stars and @xmath106 1 - 1.5 ( nomoto et al . 1993 , 1994 ; shigeyama et al . 1994 ; blinnikov et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the masses of the progenitors of hypernovae with @xmath107 10 ( sne 1998bw , 1997ef , and 1997cy ) are estimated to be @xmath108 ( nomoto et al .",
    "2000 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; woosley et al . 1999 ; turatto et al .",
    "this could be related to the stellar mass dependence of the explosion mechanisms and the formation of compact remnant , i.e. , less massive stars form neutron stars , while more massive stars tend to form black holes .    to explain the observed relation between [ zn / fe ] and [ fe / h ] , we further need to know how @xmath101 and @xmath88 of supernovae and [ fe / h ] of metal - poor halo stars are related . in the early galactic epoch",
    "when the galaxy is not yet chemically well - mixed , [ fe / h ] may well be determined by the first generation of sne .",
    "the formation of metal - poor stars has been suggested to be driven by a supernova shock , so that [ fe / h ] is determined by the ejected fe mass and the amount of circumstellar hydrogen swept - up by the shock wave ( ryan et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "explosions with the following two combinations of @xmath101 and @xmath88 may be responsible for the formation of stars with very small [ fe / h ] :    \\i ) energetic explosions of massive stars ( @xmath108 ) : for these massive progenitors , the supernova shock wave tends to propagate further out because of the large explosion energy and large strmgren sphere of the progenitors ( nakamura et al .",
    "the effect of @xmath88 may be important since the hydrogen mass swept up by the supernova shock is roughly proportional to @xmath88 ( e.g. , ryan et al 1996 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) .",
    "\\ii ) normal supernova explosions of less massive stars ( @xmath109 ) : these supernovae are assumed to eject a rather small mass of fe ( shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) , and most sne are assumed to explode with normal @xmath88 irrespective of @xmath101 .",
    "the above relations lead to the following two possible scenarios to explain [ zn / fe ] @xmath4 observed in metal - poor stars .",
    "\\i ) hypernova - like explosions of massive stars ( @xmath110 ) with @xmath111 : contribution of highly asymmetric explosions in these stars may also be important . the question is what fraction of such massive stars explode as hypernovae ; the imf - integrated yields must be consistent with [ zn / fe ] @xmath75 0 at [ fe / h ] @xmath112 .",
    "\\ii ) explosion of less massive stars ( @xmath113 ) with @xmath0 or a large asymmetry : this scenario , after integration over the imf , might reproduce the observed abundance pattern for [ fe / h]@xmath62 ( tsujimoto & shigeyama 1998 ) . however , the fe yield has to be very small in order to satisfy the observed [ o / fe ] value ( @xmath114 ) for the metal - poor stars .",
    "for example , the @xmath64ni mass yield of our 13@xmath46 model has to be less than 0.006@xmath46 , which appears to be inconsistent with the observed luminosities ( and thus the @xmath64ni mass ) of core - collapse sne of sne 1993j and 1994i , whose progenitor masses are estimated to be 13 - 15 @xmath46 ( see , e.g. , figure 10 of iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "it seems that the [ o / fe ] ratio of metal - poor stars and the @xmath88-@xmath101 relations from supernova observations favor the massive energetic explosion scenario for enhanced [ zn / fe ] .",
    "however , we need to construct detailed galactic chemical evolution models to distinguish between the two scenarios for [ zn / fe ] .",
    "for that purpose , in figures 15 - 17 , we show the overall abundance pattern in the ejecta ( after radioactive decays ) for the models which yield [ zn / fe ] = 0.3 - 0.6 as a result of the `` mixing and fall - back '' process ( except for the 13 @xmath46 model ) .",
    "the mass - cuts are chosen to eject 0.07@xmath46 @xmath64ni for @xmath115 13 and 15 @xmath46 , and to realize [ o / fe ] = 0 for @xmath116 .",
    "the yields are also listed in tables 5 - 13 .",
    "here large [ o / fe ] @xmath117 is assumed for @xmath118 to reproduce the majority of the observed abundance pattern .",
    "we note that our mn yields are roughly a factor of 10 smaller than in nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and nakamura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and cr is slightly overproduced .",
    "main source of the differences is that @xmath26 in the incomplete si - burning region of our models are larger than that of previous models .",
    "if @xmath26 in the incomplete si - burning layers is slightly reduced from 0.49996 to 0.49977 , for example , mn yield is enhanced by a factor of @xmath75 10 and cr yield is slightly reduced .",
    "smaller @xmath26 leads to a smaller zn mass fraction . for @xmath119",
    ", however , the produced amount of zn is almost the same as in our current models as far as @xmath120 erg .",
    "such @xmath26 would be obtained for models with very low but non - zero metallicity . in other words ,",
    "the mn abundance may be a good indicator of real pop iii ejecta .",
    "our co / fe ratios as in all previous works ( nomoto et al . 1997 ; ww95 ; nakamura et al . 1999 ) are at least a factor of 3 - 5 smaller than the observed ones .",
    "however , we consider that the deficiency of co is not as serious as zn by the following reasons .",
    "first , we have not included neutrino processes yet , but they might enhace the co yield ( ww95 ) .",
    "second , co is the decay product of odd - z element @xmath58cu , and its yield depends on uncertain reaction rates involving proton and neutrons . on the other hand , zn is mainly the decay product of even - z element @xmath59ge , and its abundance is mostly determined by the less uncertain q - values and partition functions of @xmath24 - nuclei .      the observed trend of another iron - peak element , ni , is also interesting . unlike the elements we have focused on , [ ni / fe ] of metal - poor stars shows no clear trend ( see e.g. , ryan et al . 1996 ; nakamura et al .",
    "theoretically , this is understood as the fact that ni is produced abundantly by both complete and incomplete si - burning .",
    "recently , elliison , ryan & prochaska ( 2001 ) observed dla abundance and found [ co / fe ] @xmath121 , which is similar to the metal - poor halo stars .",
    "they , on the other hand , did not find oversolar [ ni / fe ] .",
    "similar results have also been found by norris et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who observed abundances of five halo stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath122 .",
    "they discussed that the results are inconsistent with the predictions of nakamura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where the enhancement of [ co / fe ] appears to be accompanied by the enhancement of [ ni / fe ] .",
    "we note that the increase in [ ni / fe ] along with the increase in [ co / fe ] is not significant in the models shown in this paper .",
    "let us compare the small [ co / fe ] model in table 6 ( 20@xmath46 , @xmath123 , @xmath65ni)=0.07 , [ zn / fe]=0.02 ) and the high [ co / fe ] model in table 13 ( 30@xmath46 , @xmath124 , @xmath65ni)=0.087 , [ zn / fe]=0.43 ) . in the former model , the ejected masses of co and ni ( two most abundant isotopes are @xmath87ni and @xmath125ni ) are ( @xmath58co , @xmath87ni , @xmath125ni)=(2.0e-5 , 2.0e-3 , 1.2e-4)@xmath46 . in the latter model , ( @xmath58co , @xmath87ni , @xmath125ni)=(3.4e-4 , 2.8e-3 , 8.5e-4)@xmath46 , so that co is larger by a factor of 17 , while ni is larger only by a factor of 1.8 than in the former model .    the apparent difference from the results in nakamura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) can be understood as follows . in nakamura",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , the explosion energy was fixed to be @xmath123 .",
    "they obtained the larger co / fe ratio for more massive sne ii by assuming `` deeper '' mass - cuts so that @xmath26 in the explosive burning region is smaller @xmath126 ) . for smaller @xmath26 ,",
    "the co abundance is larger , but the abundance of ni ( especially @xmath125ni ) is enhanced by a larger factor than co. therefore , the increase in [ ni / fe ] with [ co / fe ] was unavoidable , unless neutrinos substantially enhance @xmath26 in the deep complete si burning region .    in our present models , mass - cuts of the larger co ( and zn ) models",
    "are not deeper in @xmath68 ( see table 4 ) and @xmath26 in the complete si burning region is not small .",
    "this is because , we assume larger explosion energy for more massive stars , which shifts the mass - cut outwards in @xmath68 . as a result , the dominant ni isotope is @xmath87ni . in our model , with increasing @xmath88 , the abundance of co , zn , and @xmath125ni increase more than that of @xmath87ni .",
    "therefore , co and zn abundances can be enhanced without appreciable increase in the ni abundance . in this sense ,",
    "the abundance trends of very metal - poor stars is better explained with hypernova models rather than the simple `` deep '' mass - cut models ( nakamura et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "one may wonder whether the abundance anomaly of iron - peak elements discussed in this paper may be related to the peculiar imf of pop iii stars .",
    "it is quite likely that the imf of pop iii stars is different from that of pop i and ii stars , and that more massive stars are abundant for pop iii ( e.g. , nakamura & umemura 1999 ; omukai & nishi 1999 ; bromm , coppi & larson 1999 ) .",
    "they have discussed that the imf of pop iii and very low metal stars may have a peak at even larger masses , around approximately one hundred to a few hundred solar masses . if @xmath127 , then these stars are likely to form black holes either without explosion or with energetic explosions .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of the latter case may not be so different from the models considered here .",
    "this might favor the scenario that invokes the hypernova - like explosions for large [ zn / fe ] .    if stars are even more massive than @xmath128 , these stars become pair - instability sne ( pisne ) and their nucleosynthesis is different from core - collapse sne as summarized in appendix a ( barkat , rakavy & sack 1967 ; ober , el eid & fricke 1983",
    "; woosley & weaver 1982 ) . in paricular ,",
    "pisne produce [ zn / fe ] @xmath129 , because in pisne , iron peak elements are mostly produced by incomplete si burning so that the mass fraction of complete si burning elements is much smaller than that of sne ii ( fig .",
    "18 & 19 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that pisne are unlikely to produce a large enough zn / fe ratio to explain the observations .      in this paper",
    ", we have shown that such a large zn abundance as [ zn / fe ] @xmath75 0.5 observed in metal - poor stars can be realized in certain supernova models .",
    "this implies that the assumption of [ zn / fe ] @xmath130 usually adopted in the dla abundance analyses may not be well justified",
    ". rather [ zn / fe ] may provide important information on the imf and/or the age of the dla systems .",
    "we have considered only a few elements to constrain the nucleosynthesis of pop iii stars , because their trends are most clear .",
    "data for other elements show less clear trends or currently have relatively large error bars",
    ". however , additional information will be very useful .",
    "for example , [ s / fe ] and [ c / o ] may be important to distinguish the scenarios of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "in this appendix we present the yields of our pop iii pair instability sn ( pisn ) models with the initial masses @xmath133 150 , 170 , 200 and 270 @xmath46 .",
    "these stars enter into the electron - positron pair - instability region during the central oxygen burning stages , and contract quasi - dynamically .",
    "then the central temperature increases to @xmath134k , which is so high that central oxygen - burning takes place explosively , being much faster than neutrino energy losses .",
    "the generated nuclear energy is large enough for internal energy to exceed the gravitaional binding energy .",
    "then the stars disrupt completely without leaving compact remnants and become pisne . in our @xmath135 model ,",
    "the total energy of the star does not become positive after central oxygen and si burnings and hence the star collapse into a black hole .",
    "the main purpose of this appendix is to show that large [ zn / fe ] ratio is not realized in these sne .",
    "more detailed explanaton will be given elsewhere . in table 14 , we summarize the initial , he core , and c - o core masses and the ejected @xmath64ni masses .",
    "we note that the amount of ejected @xmath64ni masses are quite sensitive to the central temperature at bounce , which depends on the ratio between the kinetic energy and the internal energy generated by nuclear burning .",
    "since the hydrodynamical behavior is rather sensitive to those factors , the results shown here are still preliminary ; nevertheless this uncertainty does not affect the conclusion on [ zn / fe ] described below .",
    "in these models convective mixing parameter is chosen to be @xmath136 .",
    "the yields are shown in table 15 - 18 and the abundance patterns are shown in figures 18 & 19 .",
    "most striking feature is the small [ zn , co / fe ] ratios . this is because in pisne the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete si burning regions are much smaller than core - collapse sne .",
    "a large amount of zn and co could be produced if the central temperature at bounce is higher .",
    "however , in this case incomplete si - burning region is also extended .",
    "therefore , the small [ zn , co / fe ] ratios are inevitable for pisn models and this conclusion is independent of any possible uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the abundance pattern seen in the very metal - poor halo stars were not resulted from the pattern of pisne .",
