    "in the past few years , much interest has been paid to the study of random fields over graphs .",
    "it has been driven by the growing needs for both theoretical and practical results for data indexed by graphs .",
    "on the one hand , the definition of graphical models by j.n .",
    "darroch , s.l .",
    "lauritzen and t.p .",
    "speed in @xmath1 @xcite fostered new interest in markov fields , and many tools have been developed in this direction ( see , for instance  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "on the another hand , the industrial demand linked to graphical problems has risen with the apparition of new technologies . in very particular ,",
    "the internet and social networks provide a huge field of applications , but biology , economy , geography or image analysis also benefit from models taking into account a graph structure .",
    "+ the analysis of road traffic is at the root of this work .",
    "actually , prediction of road traffic deals with the forecast of speed of vehicles which may be seen as a spatial random field over the traffic network .",
    "some work has been done without taking into account the particular graph structure of the speed process ( see for example @xcite and @xcite for related statistical issues ) . in this paper",
    ", we build a new model for gaussian random fields over graphs and study statistical properties of such stochastic processes .. 1 in a random field over a graph is a spatial process indexed by the vertices of a graph , namely @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a given graph .",
    "many models already exist in the probabilistic literature , ranging from markov fields to autoregressive processes , which are based on two general kinds of construction . on the one hand ,",
    "graphical models are defined as markov fields ( see for instance  @xcite ) , with a particular dependency structure .",
    "actually , they are built by specifying a dependency structure for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , conditionally to the other variables , as soon as the locations @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected . for graphical models ,",
    "we refer for instance to  @xcite and references therein . on the other hand",
    ", the graph itself , through the adjacency operator , can provide the dependency .",
    "this is the case , for example , of autoregressive models on @xmath8 ( see  @xcite ) . here",
    ", the local form of the graph is strongly used for statistical inference .",
    ".1 in more precisely , the usual purpose of graphical models is to design an underlying graph which reflects the dependency of the data .",
    "this method has to be applied when this graph is not easily known ( for instance social networks ) or when it plays the role of a model which helps understanding the correlations between high complex data ( for instance for biological purpose ) .",
    "our approach differs since , in our case , the graph is known , and we aim at using a model with _",
    "stationary _ properties .",
    "indeed , in the case of road traffic , we can consider that the correlations of the process depend mainly on the local structure of the network .",
    "this assumption is commonly accepted among professionals of road trafficking speaking of capacity of the road .",
    ".1 in in this paper , we extend some classical results from time series to spatial fields over general graphs and provide a new definition for regular @xmath0 processes on graphs . for this",
    ", we will make use of spectral analysis and extend to our framework some classical results of time series .",
    "in particular , the notion of spectral density may be extended to graphs .",
    "this will enable us to construct a maximum likelihood estimate for parametric models of spectral densities .",
    "this also leads to an extension of the whittle s approximation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "actually , many extensions of this approximation have been performed , even in non - stationary cases ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the extension studied here concerns general @xmath0 processes over graphs .",
    "we point out that we will compare throughout all the paper our new framework with the case @xmath9 .. 1 in section [ s : rappels ] is devoted to some definitions of graphs and spectral theory for time series .",
    "then we state the definition of general @xmath0 processes over a graph in section [ s : analytic_construction ] .",
    "the convergence of the whittle maximum likelihood estimate and its asymptotic efficiency are given in theorems [ thm_conv ] and [ t : as_norm ] in section [ s : main_thm ] .",
    "section [ s : discussion ] is devoted to a short discussion on potential applications and perspectives .",
    "some simulations are provided in section [ s : simul ] .",
    "the last section provides all necessary tools to prove the main theorems , in particular szeg s lemmas for graphs are given in section [ s : szego ] , while the proofs of the technical lemmas are postponed in section  [ s : technical_lemmas ] .",
    "in the whole paper , we will consider a gaussian spatial process @xmath2 indexed by the vertices of an infinite undirected weighted graph .    we will call @xmath10 this graph , where    * @xmath3 is the set of vertices .",
    "@xmath11 is said to be infinite as soon as @xmath3 is infinite ( but countable ) .",
    "* @xmath12^{g\\times g}$ ] is the symmetric weighted adjacency operator .",
    "that is , @xmath13 when @xmath14 and @xmath7 are connected .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 is symmetric ( @xmath16 ) since we deal only with undirected graphs .    for any vertex @xmath6",
    ", a vertex @xmath7 is said to be a neighbor of @xmath17 if , and only if , @xmath18 .",

    "this is not restrictive since re - normalizing the adjacency operator does not change the objects introduced later . in particular , the spectral representation of hilbertian operator is not sensitive to a renormalization .",
    "notice that in the classical case @xmath23 , the renormalized adjacency operator is @xmath24    here , @xmath25 . this case will be used in all the paper as an illustration example .    to introduce the spectral decomposition ,",

    "we aim now at providing a spectral representation of any bounded normal hilbertian operator . for this , first recall the definition of a resolution of identity ( see for example @xcite ) :    let @xmath40 be a @xmath41-algebra over a set @xmath42 .",

    "for instance , we can assume that the data are missing completely at random .",
    "this particular case is interesting for prediction issues .",
    "another strong potential application is quasi - transitive graphs , as mentioned above .",
    "indeed , take for instance a finite graph ( the pattern ) and reproduce it at each vertex of an infinite ( amenable ) vertex - transitive graph .",
    "the final graph is then quasi - transitive , and all the previous assumptions hold .",
    "this seems to be a natural extension of what happens for @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , in this situation as in @xmath8 , our work may also be applied to a process with missing values .. 1 in    note also that conditions of both amenability of the graphs and regularity of spectral densities seem natural , looking at the szeg s lemmas ( see section [ s : szego ] ) .",
    "indeed , the difference computed in lemma [ lem_hom ] is only due to edge effects .",
    ".1 in    thus , there are two ways for relaxing this conditions . on the one hand",
    ", it could be interesting to deal with lower regularity ( for instance to study long memory processes ) for the spectral densities .",
    "on the other hand , it could be also interesting to relax conditions on the graph , for instance for more regular densities .",
