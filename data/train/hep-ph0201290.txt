    "evidence in favor of @xmath1 oscillations is accumulating at a fast rate . the strong evidence for disappearance of atmospheric @xmath2 in super - kamiokande ( sk )",
    "@xcite , consistent with the @xmath3 spectrum anomaly in macro @xcite and with soudan-2 @xmath4 data @xcite , is successfully explained by @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the recent data from the first long - baseline k2k experiment @xcite also support such an interpretation @xcite .",
    "the global evidence for solar @xmath5 oscillations from radiochemical ( cl and ga ) @xcite and cherenkov ( sk and sno ) detectors @xcite is strongly corroborated ( at a significance level @xmath6 @xcite ) by the comparison of the recent sno data @xcite with those collected in sk @xcite .",
    "we review `` established '' aspects of the above pieces of evidence , as well as ( partially ) `` unsolved '' issues concerning sterile neutrinos , new neutrino interactions , and the controversial @xmath7 signal in lsnd @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the sno heavy - water experiment is to measure the solar neutrino flux both in charged current mode @xmath8 sensitive to @xmath5 only , and in neutral current mode @xmath9 sensitive to any active flavor @xmath10 .",
    "a suppression of the cc / nc ratio is expected in the presence of @xmath11 oscillations .",
    "the first cc data have recently been released @xcite , while the nc measurement is still in progress @xcite .",
    "the sk experiment is also sensitive to cc and nc reactions through elastic scattering on @xmath12 , @xmath13 but no discrimination is possible for the event type ( cc or nc ) .",
    "however , one can indirectly use the sno cc measurement to `` extract '' a possible nc component in sk .",
    "indeed , this component turns out to be nonzero at @xmath6 level , indicating that @xmath14 transitions are occurring .      assuming active @xmath1 oscillations , the main unknowns for the calculations of the sno cc rate are the @xmath5 survival probability averaged over the detector response function , @xmath15 , and the ratio @xmath16 of the absolute @xmath17b spectrum to the reference one estimated in the standard solar model ( ssm ) of @xcite .",
    "analogously , the unknowns associated to the sk es rate are @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "the two available data ( sno cc and sk es rates ) are insufficient to pin down three unknowns [ @xmath19 , unless one make some hypothesis on either the ssm ( e.g. , by setting @xmath20 ) , or the oscillation model [ e.g. , by setting a functional form of @xmath21 ) ] .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that , by appropriately shifting the sk energy threshold , one can reach an accurate `` equalization '' of the sk and sno response as a function of the neutrino energy .",
    "for the current sno threshold in electron kinetic energy ( 6.75 mev ) , the sk threshold providing the best equalization is 8.60 mev , as shown in fig .",
    "1 @xcite .",
    "this lucky circumstance implies that the sno cc and sk es experiments , above such thresholds , are sensitive to the _ same _ energy - averaged survival probability @xmath22 , @xmath23 allowing a reduction to only two unknowns ( @xmath24 . the corresponding constraints placed by the current sk and sno data are shown in fig",
    ".  2 @xcite .",
    "the data prefer @xmath25 , in agreement with the ssm expectation of @xcite , and clearly indicate that @xmath26 with a significance greater than @xmath27 . , it is @xmath28 and @xmath29 . ]",
    "such conclusions are strictly model - independent : no a priori assumption has been made on the ssm ( i.e. , on @xmath16 ) or on the energy dependence of @xmath21 .",
    "since the model - independent analysis suggests the validity of both the ssm and the oscillation hypothesis , it makes sense _ to assume _ the ssm @xmath1 fluxes as input , and to calculate the oscillation probability in the simplest case of @xmath30 oscillations ( described by the mass - mixing parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the comparison with the available solar neutrino data gives , through a @xmath33 statistics , allowed regions in the plane @xmath34 . in the analysis , it is useful to include also chooz reactor data @xcite , which are relevant to bound high values of @xmath35 .",
    "figure  1 shows the results of a global pre - sno data analysis @xcite .",
    "there are several ( almost ) disconnected allowed regions in the mass - mixing plane , usually called  in the solar @xmath1 jargon  as : small mixing angle ( sma ) at @xmath36 ev@xmath37 and @xmath38 ; large mixing angle ( lma ) at @xmath39 ev@xmath37 and @xmath40 ; low @xmath35 ( low ) at @xmath41 ev@xmath37 and @xmath42 ; and multiple vacuum oscillation ( vo ) solutions at large mixing and @xmath43 ev@xmath37 , possibly connected to the the low solutions through intermediate quasi vacuum oscillation ( qvo ) solutions at @xmath44 ev@xmath37 .",
    "the vertical `` gap '' at large mixing for @xmath45@xmath46 ev@xmath37 is mainly due to nonobservation of earth matter effects at sk @xcite .",
    "the horizontal gap between the sma and the lma regions is kept stable by sk spectral data .",
    "notice that , although pre - sno data can not exclude small mixing cases ( sma ) , they globally show a preference for large mixing @xmath47)$ ] , mainly driven by sk spectral data @xcite .",
    "the preference for large mixing is strengthened in the post - sno analysis , as shown in fig .",
    ", the sma solution disappears at @xmath48 ( while the lma one provides the best fit ) : a very important consequence of the first sno cc data .",
    "the reason is the following : the sma solution in fig .",
    "3 typically predicts values of @xmath49 larger than those favored in fig .  2 .",
    "in order to adapt to relatively low values of @xmath22 , the sma solutions tends to move rightwards , where the nonadiabatic @xmath5 suppression is stronger and energy spectrum distortions are larger ; in doing so , however , the sma solution gets in conflict with the nonobservation of spectral distortions in sk , and becomes strongly disfavored in the global fit .",
    "similar results have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the extension to @xmath50 oscillations , within phenomenological bounds , does not significantly alter the emerging post - sno global picture @xcite .    the surviving large - mixing solutions in fig .",
    "4 will soon be tested in upcoming experiments .",
    "in particular , kamland @xcite will probe the lma solution through reactor @xmath1 disappearance over long baselines , while the borexino solar @xmath1 experiment @xcite will probe the low and ( q)vo solutions through day - night and seasonal variation effects , respectively .",
    "a confirmation of the current best - fit solution ( lma ) would be extremely important for the physics potential of planned @xmath1 factory @xcite or superbeam @xcite projects .",
    "the sno - sk data comparison provides model - independent evidence for @xmath5 oscillations into active species @xcite .",
    "can one exclude additional transitions of solar @xmath5 to a sterile state @xmath51 ?",
    "the analysis in @xcite seems to show that a large @xmath51 component can be tolerated , provided that @xmath16 is significantly increased : then @xmath52 oscillations would make the extra b @xmath1 flux unobservable in sno and sk .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite shows that , even with unconstrained @xmath17b neutrino flux , meaningful upper limits can be put on the @xmath51 admixture , since for large - amplitude @xmath52 oscillations the global fit becomes always worse ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the difference in the results can be traced @xcite to the role of sk day - night spectral data , which are used in @xcite but not in @xcite .    in any case , it can be safely concluded that there is no evidence in favor of additional @xmath51 mixing , although subdominant @xmath52 transitions can not be excluded within the still large uncertainties . the limiting case of pure @xmath52 is strongly disfavored after sno :",
    "accepting this case would be equivalent to assume the the sno - sk rate difference is a mere @xmath53 stat .",
    "the evidence for dominant @xmath0 oscillations in atmospheric neutrinos is robust .",
    "figure  6 shows that the neutrino - induced lepton events in sk , spanning 4 orders of magnitude in energy @xmath54 and three orders of magnitude in @xmath1 pathlength @xmath55 , are perfectly described by the simple hypothesis of @xmath30 oscillations .",
    "the best - fit mass - mixing parameters , within a factor of about two , are stable around @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .    however , it is important to keep in mind that two important pieces of information are still `` hidden '' in the data : a clear observation of @xmath58 appearance ( for which sk can only provide interesting  but not really decisive  hints @xcite ) and the observation of a real `` oscillatory '' pattern ( disappearance + reapperance ) .",
    "the first issue will be attacked by the cern - to - gran sasso experiment opera @xcite , and the second by new long - baseline or atmospheric experiments , probing @xmath59 disappearance with higher @xmath60 resolution @xcite .",
    "let us now consider some current topics about the dominant @xmath0 channel and about subdominant effects due to either extra states ( @xmath5 or @xmath51 ) or new interactions .",
    "the stability of @xmath0 oscillations as the dominant mechanism for atmospheric @xmath2 disappearance is guaranteed by several independent facts : ( i ) nonobservation of matter effects associated to possible large @xmath5 or @xmath51 admixture @xcite ; ( ii ) strong upper bounds on additional @xmath5 mixing from negative chooz reactor searches @xcite ; ( iii ) nonobservation of nc event suppression due to possible @xmath61 in sk @xcite ; ( iv ) hints of @xmath58 appearance in sk @xcite ; ( v ) generally poorer fits provided by alternative ( `` exotic '' ) explanations @xcite , with the possible exception of a decoherence model @xcite .",
    "the stability of the best - fit parameters , on the other hand , is guaranteed by the strong disappearance effect observed in the mg@xmath3 sample of sk ( @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "6 ) : the onset of disappearance at the horizon ( fixing the length scale @xmath55 ) determines the squared mass difference @xmath63 , while the maximum suppression of the upward muon rate @xmath64 forces the mixing amplitude @xmath65 to be nearly maximal .      the kek - to - kamioka ( k2k ) long - baseline @xmath1 experiment ( @xmath66 km ) aims to verify the sk atmospheric @xmath1 anomaly through disappearance of low - energy ( @xmath67 gev ) accelerator @xmath2 s .",
    "the recent k2k data @xcite ( 44 events observed against 64 expected ) already suggest that the null hypothesis of no oscillations is rejected at 97% c.l . @xcite .",
    "one can make a further step and analyze the consistency and the impact of k2k data in the context of the @xmath0 oscillation scenario @xcite .",
    "figure  7 shows the number of events expected in k2k ( solid curve ) as a function of @xmath68 ( for maximal mixing , @xmath69 ) , as compared with the k2k data ( @xmath70 allowed band ) .",
    "the theoretical curve crosses the central value of the band at @xmath71 ev@xmath37 , in agreement with the value derived from sk atmospheric @xmath1 data .",
    "therefore , k2k supports the same @xmath0 oscillation scenario favored by atmospheric neutrino experiments , and it makes sense to combine sk and k2k data in a global analysis ( dominated , of course , by the more accurate sk data ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "8 , in terms of bounds on @xmath68 from sk only , from sk+k2k , and from sk+k2k with halved k2k errors .",
    "it can be seen that k2k can appreciably tighten both the lower and the upper bound on @xmath68 .",
    "strengthening the lower bound is particularly important for the new generation of accelerator experiments with longer baselines @xcite , which would rapidly loose sensitivity to oscillation effects for @xmath68 approaching @xmath72 ev@xmath37 .",
    "it is natural to assume that at least one extra state ( @xmath5 ) can play a role besides dominant @xmath0 oscillations ( @xmath50 mixing ) .",
    "a possible light sterile state @xmath51 might also participate to oscillations in extended @xmath73 scenarios @xcite . in both cases , the standard @xmath60 dependence of the @xmath0 oscillation phase",
    "is modified by the so - called mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter effects in the earth .",
    "simbolically , @xmath74 \\oplus [ { \\rm msw}]\\ .\\ ] ] nonobservation of deviations from the standard @xmath60 dependence in sk places significant constraints on additional mixing of @xmath75 with additional flavor states .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "9 , as we now discuss .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "9 shows the bounds on additional @xmath5 mixing , expressed in terms of the leading squared mass difference @xmath68 and of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 in usual @xmath50 mixing notation .",
    "the looser bounds in the panel arise from the absence of observed msw effects and of distortions of the electron samples in sk ( see also fig .",
    "the tighter bounds refer to the sk+chooz combination , dominated by the chooz nonobservation of @xmath78 disappearance .",
    "altogether , sk+chooz set an upper bound of a few % on additional @xmath5 mixing .",
    "such bound is probably too tight to allow detection of residual matter effects with higher sk statistics @xcite .",
    "establishing a nonzero value for @xmath77 is a major challenge for future neutrino oscillation experiments , with far - reaching consequences also for non - oscillatory probes of the neutrino mass and mixing @xcite and for model building and leptonic cp violation @xcite .      in this case ,",
    "matter effects are typically somewhat weaker than for @xmath5 mixing , and there is no analogous of the chooz experiment .",
    "therefore , the upper bounds on @xmath51 mixing ( parametrized in fig .  9 in terms of a suitable angle @xmath79 , see @xcite ) , are weaker than the previous ones for @xmath5 mixing",
    ".    however , it should be added that the limits in the right panel of fig .",
    "9 can be improved by adding : further sk data on nc enriched events @xcite ; sk hints for @xmath80 appearance @xcite ; macro muon data @xcite .",
    "our educated guess is that a global combination of all such data would limit subdominant @xmath51 mixing below 2030% .",
    "the standard @xmath60 oscillation phase of atmospheric @xmath0 oscillations can be modified not only by extra states , but also by extra ( nonstandard ) interaction of @xmath75 with a `` generalized '' background , which can be either the earth matter , or the local gravitational field , or the space - time itself .",
    "a large class of nonstandard interactions predict extra oscillations phases with a power - law dependence on energy @xcite @xmath74",
    "\\oplus [ l / e^n]\\ .\\ ] ] with integer @xmath81 . the broad @xmath60 range spanned by sk sets severe limits on the amplitude of nonstandard @xmath82 phases , as we show for two representative cases . future ( very ) long baseline accelerator experiments will not easily improve such limits @xcite , due to the their much narrower range of @xmath60 probed .",
    "violations of the equivalence principle ( vep ) , i.e. , different coupling of @xmath83 to gravity , can generate flavor oscillations .",
    "violations of lorentz invariance ( vli ) , i.e. , different limiting speeds for @xmath75 can also generate oscillations .",
    "both cases generate extra oscillation phases with @xmath84 ( phase @xmath85 ) @xcite .",
    "when added on top of standard @xmath0 transitions , such hypothetical violations are found to worsen the fit to sk data .",
    "the lack of evidence in favor of them allows to set strong upper bounds to their amplitude , as shown in fig .",
    "10 @xcite .",
    "such bounds are much tighter than the corresponding ones derived in another `` oscillation laboratory '' , namely , the kaon system .",
    "additional nc - type , four - fermion interactions can arise in susy models with r - parity breaking , leading to flavor - changing ( fc ) or flavor - diagonal ( fd ) neutrino transitions in matter .",
    "the amplitudes of such interactions are usually parameterized as `` fractions '' ( @xmath86 s ) of the standard fermi amplitude @xmath87 .",
    "their effect on oscillations is to produce energy - independent @xmath88 extra phases .",
    "no evidence is found for such phases , and upper bounds on the @xmath86 s have been recently derived in @xcite .",
    "figure  11 reports the basic results of @xcite : nonstandard interactions can not exceed a few percent strength ( in units of @xmath87 ) .",
    "while solar , atmospheric , and chooz data can be accommodated in a scenario involving only the three known neutrinos @xcite , problems arise when one tries to embed also the controversial evidence for oscillations in the @xmath7 channel found by lsnd @xcite , which is not supported ( but not totally excluded ) by the competing karmen experiment ( see fig .",
    "the evidence is characterized by small mixing and a large squared mass difference , which is incompatible with solar and atmospheric neutrino parameters , unless a fourth ( sterile ) neutrino state is introduced @xcite .",
    "two four - neutrino mass spectra can be envisaged : one with three close states and a lone state ( 3 + 1 ) @xcite , and one with two separated doublets ( 2 + 2 ) @xcite .",
    "such spectra can , in principle , accommodate the three independent square mass differences needed to drive solar , atmospheric , and lsnd oscillations .",
    "however , mixing angles turn out to be difficult to arrange without spoiling the agreement with some data .    in the 2 + 2 case",
    ", it turns out that the fractional admixture of @xmath51 in the `` solar '' and `` atmospheric '' doublets must add up to one .",
    "symbolically : @xmath89_{\\rm sol}+[\\nu_s]_{\\rm atm } = 1\\ .\\ ] ] however , the best fits to @xmath90_{\\rm sol}$ ] and @xmath90_{\\rm atm}$ ] are close to zero ( as we have seen in sec .  2.3 and 3.3.2 , respectively ) , so that the above sum rule can not be satisfied unless either @xmath90_{\\rm sol}$ ] or @xmath90_{\\rm atm}$ ] are pushed to their upper limits at 23@xmath91 @xcite .    in the 3 + 1 case",
    ", it turns out that the lsnd appearance probability @xmath92 is proportional to the @xmath2 disappearance probability ( constrained by the cdhsw accelerator experiment ) and to the @xmath5 disappearance probability ( constrained by the bugey reactor experiment ) . symbolically : @xmath93 since both factors on the r.h.s .",
    "are experimentally consistent with zero , the expected lsnd probability is doubly suppressed , and it turns out to be too small to fit the observed data @xcite .    in conclusion , the lsnd evidence does not seem to fit well in @xmath73 schemes : tension is generated between solar and atmospheric data in the 2 + 2 case , and between accelerator and reactor data in the 3 + 1 case .",
    "this tension is not strong enough , however , to exclude @xmath73 mixing with high confidence yet @xcite .    in any case , independently from the above ( model - dependent ) arguments , the lsnd issue will be soon settled by the miniboone experiment @xcite .",
    "disconfirmation of lsnd would reinforce the standard @xmath50 oscillation interpretation of solar and atmospheric @xmath1 data .",
    "a confirmation would instead imply a serious global re - examination of the oscillation evidence , in order to find new ways to make lsnd compatible with world data .",
    "we have reviewed recent topics in the neutrino oscillation phenomenology .",
    "the solar neutrino evidence for active @xmath1 oscillations is significantly strengthened by sno data as compared to sk data , independently on specific solar or oscillation models .",
    "the post - sno oscillation fit strongly favors large - mixing solutions , with a preference for relatively high values of the neutrino squared mass difference ( lma solution ) .",
    "solar neutrinos do not provide evidence for a sterile @xmath1 admixture , although a subdominant @xmath51 component can be easily tolerated .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are beautifully explained by dominant @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "preliminary k2k data are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "upper bounds can be placed on subdominant admixtures of extra states ( @xmath5 or @xmath58 ) and on subdominant contributions of extra interactions ( beyond the standard model ) .",
    "solar and atmospheric neutrino data can be easily embedded in a @xmath50 mixing scenario . however , when one tries to add a fourth sterile neutrino to embed also the lsnd data , tension arises between subsets of data",
    ". a series of new experiments will greatly improve and refine the current picture of neutrino mass and mixing in the near future ( or in the next decade at most ) , and will possibly set new challenges for the phenomenological interpretation and for model building .",
