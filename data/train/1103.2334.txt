    "at high energies the soft and the semihard components of the scattering amplitude are closely related @xcite , and it becomes important to distinguish between semihard gluons , which participate in hard parton - parton scattering , and soft gluons , emitted in any given parton - parton qcd radiation process .",
    "a class of models based on qcd incorporate soft and semihard processes in the treatment of high - energy hadronic interactions using a formulation compatible with analyticity and unitarity constraints @xcite . in this talk we present a qcd - based model @xcite in which the coupling @xmath0 is constrained by the value of the so called `` dynamical gluon mass '' ,",
    "whose existence is strongly supported by recent qcd lattice simulations .",
    "this frozen coupling , obtained by means of the pinch technique in order to derive a gauge invariant schwinger - dyson equation for the gluon propagator @xcite , has been adopted in many phenomenological studies @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we discuss some recent applications of the model to hadron - hadron collisions , gap survival probability calculations , and soft gluon resummation techniques .",
    "these results indicate a smooth transition from nonperturbative to perturbative behaviour of the qcd .",
    "in the qcd - based ( or  mini - jet \" ) models the increase of the total cross sections is associated with semihard scatterings of partons in the hadrons @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross sections is driven especially by gluon - gluon scattering processes , where the behaviour of the gluon distribution function at small @xmath1 exhibits the power law @xmath2 .",
    "since gluon - gluon subprocesses are potentially divergent at small transferred momenta , it becomes important to regulate this behaviour by introducing a mass scale which separates the perturbative from the non - perturbative qcd region .",
    "in the so called `` dgm '' model ( dynamical gluon mass model ) @xcite , the dynamical gluon mass , as well as the infrared finite coupling constant associated to it @xcite , are the natural regulators for the cross sections calculations . in this eikonal model , the total cross section ,",

    "the even eikonal is written as the sum of gluon - gluon , quark - gluon , and quark - quark contributions : @xmath12 , \\label{final4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the overlap function at impact parameter space and @xmath14 are the elementary subprocess cross sections of colliding quarks and gluons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the odd eikonal @xmath16 , that accounts for the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels , is parametrized as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dynamical gluon mass and the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants to be fitted .",
    "the factor @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 , with the dynamical coupling constant @xmath23 set at its frozen infrared value .",
    "the gluon - gluon eikonal contribution , that dominates at high energy and determines the asymptotic behaviour of the total cross sections , is written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the convoluted structure function for pair @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the subprocess cross section and @xmath29 is a fitting parameter . in the above expression",
    "it is introduced the energy threshold @xmath30 for the final state gluons , assuming that these are screened gluons @xcite . in the expression ( [ sloh1 ] )",
    "the gluon - gluon subprocess cross section @xmath28 is calculated using a procedure dictated by the dynamical perturbation theory ( dpt ) @xcite .",
    "it means that the effects of the dynamical gluon mass in the propagators and vertices are retained , and the sum of polarizations is performed for massless ( free - field ) gluons . as a result ,",
    "since the dynamical masses go to zero at large momenta , the elementary cross sections of perturbative qcd in the high - energy limit are recovered @xcite .",
    "the result of the fit to @xmath31 for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels is displayed in figs . 1 , together with the experimental data .",

    "the study of the survival probability @xmath32 of large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) is currently a subject of intense theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "its importance lies in the fact that systematic analyses of lrg open the possibility of extracting new physics from hard diffractive processes . on the theoretical side , its significance is due to the reliance of the @xmath32 calculation on subtle qcd methods .",
    "since rapidity gaps can occur in the case of higgs boson production via fusion of electroweak bosons , we have focused on @xmath33 fusion processes @xcite .",
    "the inclusive differential higgs boson production cross section via @xmath34 fusion is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the overlap function at impact parameter space of the @xmath34 bosons .",
    "this function represents the effective density of the overlapping @xmath34 boson distributions in the colliding hadrons .",
    "the cross section for producing the higgs boson and having a large rapidity gap is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the probability that the two initial hadrons have not undergone a inelastic scattering at the parton level .",
    "in the dgm model this probability is given by @xmath39 , where the imaginary part @xmath40 of the eikonal function receives contributions of parton - parton interactions .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath38 suppresses the contribution to the higgs boson cross section where the two initial hadrons overlap and there is soft rescatterings of the spectator partons .",
    "hence in our model we can write down the survival factor @xmath32 for higgs production via @xmath34 fusion as @xmath41 where we have used the normalization condition @xmath42 .",
    "the sensitivity of the survival probability @xmath32 ( for @xmath9 collisions ) to the gluon dynamical mass is shown in figure 1 for some cm energies .",
    "the @xmath32 value decreases with the increase of the energy of the incoming hadrons , in line with the available experimental data for lrg .",

    "it is possible to apply the soft resummation mechanism to the calculation of overlap functions in which the coupling @xmath0 is constrained by the value of the dynamical gluon mass .",
    "the main steps of this calculation can be summarized as follow : in qed the soft photon resummation in the energy - momentum @xmath43 can be obtained order by order as @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 = \\int_{0}^{e } \\frac{d^3k}{2k_{0}}\\ , \\left| j_{\\mu}(k,\\{p_{i}\\})\\right|^{2 } ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the four - dimensional probability distribution for soft massless quanta emitted by a semiclassical source , @xmath47 is the maximal energy allowed to single photon emission and @xmath48 is the momenta of the emitting fields .    for strong interactions",
    "the resummed transverse momentum distribution is given by @xmath49 in qcd applications @xmath50 can be written as @xcite @xmath51 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the integral of the function @xmath50 , which describes the relative transverse momentum distribution induced by soft gluon emission from a pair of initially collinear partons , downed to infrared momentum modes .",
    "the attenuation of the rise of the total cross sections comes from soft gluon @xmath52-emission .",
    "these emissions break collinearity between the colliding partons , hence changing the overlap function @xmath53 ( matter distribution ) , given by @xmath54 note that the high - energy dependence of the total hadronic cross section ( large @xmath55 value ) is intrinsically related to the small @xmath52 value of @xmath0 .",
    "thus the behaviour of @xmath0 in the infrared limit plays a central role .    in order to calculate @xmath53",

    "the frozen coupling @xmath23 avoids small @xmath52 divergences in partonic subprocesses .",

    "the general picture indicates a smooth transition from nonperturbative to perturbative behaviour of the qcd .",
    "interestingly enough , by means of a triple - regge analysis which explicitly accounts for absorptive corrections , this smooth transition can also be inferred from recent determinations of the bare triple - pomeron vertex @xcite ."
