    "zero - field hall effect in chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors ( scs ) has drawn much attention in literature recently .",

    "indeed , it has already been shown that spontaneous hall effect could arise from the intrinsic angular momentum of cooper pairs @xcite as well as from the spontaneous surface current .",
    "@xcite more recently , hall conductivity due to impurity effect @xcite or to multiband sc structure @xcite was also studied , which could give possible explanation to the observed polar kerr effect in the superconducting state of sr@xmath6ruo@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we address the zero - field hall effect in a chiral @xmath0-wave sc originating from another mechanism , namely the vortex dynamics near kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) superfluid ( sf ) or sc films , quantized vortices",
    "are realized as topological defects in the condensates , whose dynamics has been one of the key ingredients in understanding 2d phase transition phenomena .",
    "@xcite a few decades ago , kosterlitz and thouless @xcite suggested a static theory to relate a phase transition observed in superfluid @xmath8he film @xcite to vortex - antivortex pair unbinding process across a transition temperature @xmath9 . in this picture , the logarithmic vortex - antivortex interaction is screened by smaller pairs and is renormalized to @xmath10 of its bare value @xmath11 for temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the length - dependent dielectric constant @xmath13 is used to describe the static screening of pair interaction . when @xmath14 , there exists a finite pair size @xmath15 such that the interaction becomes vanishingly small .",
    "consequently , the pair unbinds and free vortices emerge ; superfluidity is then destroyed .",
    "soon after that , ambegaokar , halperin , nelson , and siggia ( ahns ) @xcite combined this static theory with hall and vinen s dynamical description of vortex motion @xcite to give an analysis of the dynamical effect on the phase transition .",
    "concisely speaking , the renormalization process in the static theory @xcite is truncated by vortex dynamics with a characteristic length @xmath16 instead of going to its completion . @xcite here @xmath17 is the diffusivity of vortex movement and @xmath18 is the driving frequency .",
    "this results in broadening transition observed in @xmath8he sf films @xcite as well as in charged fermi systems such as high - temperature scs . @xcite",
    "it is instructive to explore any physical consequence stemming from this kt transition in a broken @xmath5 symmetry state .",
    "possible experimental candidates of broken @xmath5 symmetry state could be superconducting sr@xmath6ruo@xmath7 ( ref .  ) or @xmath19he - a phase thin film , @xcite in which pairing of chiral @xmath0-wave type is expected .",
    "indeed , in literature some theoretical works have been done to investigate new features specific to scs with pairing of this type near kt transition .",

    "assuming isotropic fermi surface , two kinds of pairing fields can be obtained : @xmath29 and @xmath30 with asymptotic behavior at large @xmath31 being @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",

    "@xcite in particular , their hall and vinen coefficients @xcite do not share the same value , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see section ii a ) .",
    "this results in a nonzero  convective \" term in a vortex pair polarization fokker - planck equation in addition to the conventional diffusive terms , while in its @xmath42-wave counterpart such convective motion does not enter the dynamics .",
    "@xcite the relative strength of convection is quantified by a convective ratio @xmath43 in this paper .",
    "it is due to such distinct feature that pair polarization transverse to the driving force field becomes possible even without applied magnetic field .",
    "a nonzero vortex - dynamics - induced hall conductivity @xmath44 then follows naturally .",
    "the main result of this work is that in the bound pair dynamics description , we obtain nonvanishing hall conductivity @xmath44 and ac conductivity @xmath45 near the kt transition .",
    "one of the interesting features in the hall conductivity is that strong positive peak and sign changes in @xmath46 are observed at suitable frequency region above the transition temperature , as well as above @xmath9 in temperature domain at fixed frequencies . on the other hand , @xmath47 is shown to have similar features as in ahns s results .",
    "we note that the shapes of two length - dependent response functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which corresponds respectively to the longitudinal and transverse response of bound pairs with separation @xmath50 to external perturbation with frequency @xmath18 , play a determining role on the behavior of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
