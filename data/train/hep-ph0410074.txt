    "the existence of a @xmath2 baryon with @xmath3 and @xmath4 decaying into a kaon and a nucleon with a small width of less than 10 mev , has been confirmed by several experiments @xcite .",
    "a problem is the distribution of masses , which spans the region from 1520 to 1540 mev , but not in a way consistent with one object @xcite .",
    "baryon and meson resonances in hadron physics generally appear in su(3 ) flavor multiplets . the lowest - dimensional possibility for",
    "the @xmath2 is a flavor antidecuplet ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "weak evidence exists for another exotic member in such an antidecuplet in the form of a @xmath6 resonance @xcite , although there are by now many experiments that do nt see this state .",
    "interesting fact about the @xmath2 was the accurate prediction made in the chiral soliton model @xcite , including the prediction of weak coupling to the @xmath7-channel .",
    "the presence of anti - strangeness in the system , however , calls for an understanding in terms of quark models .    baryons with @xmath4 require a minimal configuration containing four quarks and one antiquark .",
    "this opens up a multitude of possibilities and it is therefore surprising that there does not seem to be a rich spectrum of pentaquark states .",
    "the general qualitative understanding of the absence of multi - quark states ( color singlet combinations other than @xmath8 and @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) is the possibility of fission of such configurations into simpler color singlets , @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "for such a mechanism one naturally expects widths larger than those for decays of baryons or mesons via @xmath8-creation , thus several hundreds mev , unless the state is less than a few tens of mev above threshold .",
    "actually , multiquark configurations may not be visible at all .",
    "the possibility of fission spoils the confinement , which is the necessary ingredient to produce hadrons .",
    "a way to deal with the artificial confinement in the case of multiquark states is the p - matrix formalism @xcite in which the calculated configurations appear as the poles in the p - matrix .",
    "this quantity merely describes the boundary condition needed to match a short - range quark description onto hadronic decay channels and the poles do not ( necessarily ) show up as poles in the ( physical ) s - matrix .",
    "possible structures of pentaquark baryons , width=264 ]    of course , the mechanism of fission is also impossible if the mass is below the threshold of the fission products .",
    "an example is the deuteron containing six quarks , which is stable against decay into two nucleons .",
    "the example of the deuteron also shows that a multi - quark configuration still allows many classes of configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) including bound states of color singlet subsystems .",
    "this has been studied for the @xmath7 system already in the sixties ( see e.g.  @xcite ) the small width of the @xmath2 points to a specific internal structure that evades the fission procedure , such as was for instance suggested in the work of jaffe and wilczek @xcite .",
    "this still asks for an explanation of the absence of rich spectra of multi - quark states such as studied already decades ago @xcite .",
    "two possible ingredients that are relevant in a qualitative analysis of the stability of multi - quark states , are + ( 1 ) the first is the observation that hadron spectra follow a constituent quark behavior with superimposed on that a color - magnetic spin - spin interaction . + ( 2 ) the second ingredient is the chiral symmetry implimentation in the form of the light pions , of which the masses are lighter than expected on the basis of ( 1 ) .",
    "i will combine results of previous systematic studies of the spin - spin interaction in multi - quark clusters @xcite to look for exceptional configurations that experience a strong attractive color - magnetic interaction and that can not be lowered by fissioning the system , adding ( anti-)quarks , or emitting pions .",
    "the hyperfine structure in the spectrum of baryons and mesons can be understood in terms of the color spin - spin interaction arising from lowest - order one gluon exchange between pairs of quarks @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the spin matrices and @xmath15 are the color charges of the _ _",
    "i__th constituent quark and @xmath16 measures the interaction strength , which in a specific model can be calculated and depends then e.g. on quark masses and/or size parameters.we will simply use an average strength in our estimates , in which case the color - magnetic interactions becomes proportional to a group - theoretical factor , @xmath17 this expression will also be used for colored quark - clusters in which all quarks are assumed to be in relative s - waves .",
    "color magnetic hyperfine structure in baryons and mesons .",
    "the configurations are labeled by flavor and spin ( f , s),title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   color magnetic hyperfine structure in baryons and mesons .",
    "the configurations are labeled by flavor and spin ( f , s),title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    the color - magnetic interaction in colorless @xmath18 and @xmath19 situations ( mesons and baryons ) is given in fig .",
    "[ fig - hadrons ] .",
    "it explains e.g. the splitting between the baryon octet and decuplet , such as the @xmath20 splitting of about 300 mev .",
    "hence the proportionality constant relating the hyperfine structure and the factor @xmath21 is about 75 mev .",
    "this also works fine for mesons like @xmath22 and @xmath23 . with a flavor independent strenght",
    "one should not expect extreme accuracy as is clear from the fact that @xmath24 and @xmath25 baryons would remain degenerate instead of the observed 70 mev splitting , but this can be cured by using flavor dependence , in particular a slight decrease of the strength for strange quarks . at this stage",
    "we will not worry about these details .",
    "a notable exceptional hadron is the pion .",
    "the pion is much lighter ( and @xmath26 splitting is much larger ) than expected on grounds of the naive use of the color - magnetic interaction .",
    "color magnetic hyperfine structure for multiquark baryons .",
    "the configurations are labeled by flavor and spin ( f , s),width=264 ]    the calculation of color - magnetic hyperfine structure for s - wave @xmath27 baryons was studied by jaffe in the bag model @xcite .",
    "the results for @xmath21 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - multiquarks ] and show the lowest configuration with @xmath28 .",
    "this , however , has flavor structure @xmath29 , hence non - exotic .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath30-configuration may be an important component of the @xmath31 hyperon near the @xmath32-threshold .",
    "the configuration with flavor @xmath33 does contain a @xmath0-candidate with spin - parity @xmath34 , but it is unstable against fission into @xmath7 ( indicated as bp = baryon - pseudoscalar meson threshold in fig .",
    "[ fig - multiquarks ] ) .",

    "[ cluster ] ) , which has been the basis of the expectation of a special role for spin 0 over spin 1 diquarks in hadron spectroscopy or in color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "actually , having more quarks with a limited number of flavors , in general , leads to color - magnetic repulsion .",
    "this phenomenon is for instance visible for @xmath37 ( six quark ) clusters with for only nonstrange quarks , for which the lowest possibility is @xmath38 , far above the @xmath39 of the ( open ) baryon - baryon channel , which is the qualitative explanation of the repulsive core in the nucleon - nucleon interaction at the quark level .",

    "the configurations are labeled by isospin and spin ( i , s),width=340 ]    looking at @xmath44 configurations one of course can obtain a lower configuration with @xmath39 . for this one",
    "needs a spatial wave function that reduces the overlap between the clusters , turning off the short - range color - magnetic interaction between quarks belonging to the different clusters .",
    "given the quantum numbers of the bosonic diquarks , one needs in that case an antisymmetric wave function , @xmath45_a$ ] , realized e.g. through an orbital angular momentum @xmath46 .    actually , adding a strange antiquark to the nonstrange diquark leads to a strong enhancement of the color - magnetic interaction ( from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ level-4 ] .",
    "this has led to suggestions for triquark - quark configurations @xcite .",
    "actually , it is important to note that because of the identical structure of the two diquarks involved , the strange quark will oscillate between the diquark configurations , a mechanism proposed already in ref .",
    "the situation resembles systems like the @xmath49-ion ( @xmath50 ) or @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) @xcite .",
    "quark clustering may provide an answer to the exotic structure of the @xmath0 pentaquark .",
    "the particular combination of two nonstrange diquarks and a strange antiquark may be a rather unique one .",
    "for instance the @xmath53\\overline s$]-configuration is stable against fission into @xmath54 or @xmath55 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "although flavor symmetry is usually a good guidance in hadron spectroscopy , it may fail because the structure of @xmath56\\overline u$ ] that would be the one in the exotic @xmath1 pentaquark would most likely because of the exceptional role played by pions be very unstable against fission into @xmath57",
    ". hence the uniqueness could even prevail over flavor symmetry .",
    "if established beyond any doubt one should nt expect a proliferation of such states .",
    "the mechanism to understand the qualitative clustering picture alluded to in this talk , however , would be a challenge in the study of nonperturbative qcd .",
