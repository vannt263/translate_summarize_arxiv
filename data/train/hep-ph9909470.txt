    "since the discovery of qcd , it has been emphasized @xcite that exotic mesons beyond the standard octet , exist as a consequence of the non - perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . since",
    "the understanding of the nature of the @xmath0 @xcite , a large amount of theoretical efforts have been furnished in the past and pursued at present for predicting the spectra of the exotics using different qcd - like models such as the flux tube @xcite , the bags @xcite , the quark @xcite and constituent gluon @xcite models . in this talk , i shall review the present status of the predictions from the qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr )  la svz @xcite ( for a review , see e.g. : @xcite ) and from some low - energy theorems based on ward identities , which i will compare with the lattice results .",
    "since its discovery in 79 , qssr has proved to be a powerful method for understanding the hadronic properties in terms of the fundamental qcd parameters such as the qcd coupling @xmath1 , the ( running ) quark masses and the quark and/or gluon qcd vacuum condensates .",
    "the description of the method has been often discussed in the literature , where a pedagogical introduction can be , for instance , found in the book @xcite . in practice ( like also the lattice ) , one starts the analysis from the two - point correlator : _",
    "h(q^2 ) i d^4x  e^iqx 0 j_h(x ) j_h(0)^0  , built from the hadronic local currents @xmath2 , which select some specific quantum numbers . however , unlike the lattice which evaluates the correlator in the minkowski space - time , one exploits , in the sum rule approaches , the analyticity property of the correlator which obeys the well - known kllen  lehmann dispersion relation : _ h ( q^2 ) = _ 0^   _ h(t )   + ... , where ... represent subtraction points , which are polynomials in the @xmath3-variable . in this way",
    ", the @xmath4 expresses in a clear way the _ duality _ between the integral involving the spectral function im@xmath5 ( which can be measured experimentally ) , and the full correlator @xmath6 .",
    "the latter can be calculated directly in the qcd euclidean space - time using perturbation theory ( provided that @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the quark mass ) is much greater than @xmath9 ) , and the wilson expansion in terms of the increasing dimensions of the quark and/or gluon condensates which simulate the non - perturbative effects of qcd .",
    "using the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , the two - point correlator reads : _",
    "h(q^2 ) _ d=0,2,4 , ...",
    "_ dim o = d c(q^2 , ) ( )  , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary scale that separates the long- and short - distance dynamics ; @xmath11 are the wilson coefficients calculable in perturbative qcd by means of feynman diagrams techniques ; @xmath12 are the quark and/or gluon condensates of dimension @xmath13 . in this paper",
    ", we work in the massless quark limit .",
    "then , one may expect the absence of the terms of dimension 2 due to gauge invariance .",
    "however , it has been emphasized recently @xcite that the resummation of the large order terms of the perturbative series , and the effects of the higher dimension condensates due e.g. to instantons , can be mimiced by the effect of a tachyonic gluon mass , which might be understood from the short distance linear part of the qcd potential . the strength of this short distance mass has been estimated from the @xmath14 data to be @xcite : @xmath15 which leads to the value of the square of the ( short distance ) string tension : @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] in an ( unexpected ) good agreement with the lattice result @xcite of about @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the strengths of the vacuum condensates having dimensions @xmath18 are also under good control : namely @xmath19 from pion pcac , @xmath20 gev@xmath21 from @xmath22 data @xcite and from the heavy quark mass - splittings @xcite , @xmath23 gev@xmath24 @xcite , and @xmath25 1.2 gev@xmath26 from dilute gaz instantons @xcite .",
    "the spectral function is often parametrized using the  nave \" duality ansatz :   _ h(t)2m_h^2nf_h^2 ( t - m_h^2)+  qcd  continuum \" ( t - t_c )  , which has been tested @xcite using @xmath27-decay data , to give a good description of the spectral integral in the sum rule analysis ; @xmath28 ( analogue to @xmath29 ) is the the hadron s coupling to the current ; @xmath30 is the dimension of the correlator , while @xmath31 is the qcd continuum s threshold .      among the different sum rules discussed in the literature @xcite ( finite energy sum rule ( fesr ) @xcite , @xmath32-like sum rules @xcite , ... ) , we shall mainly be concerned here with : + @xmath33 the exponential laplace unsubtracted sum rule ( usr ) and its ratio : [ usr ] l_n ( ) = _ 0^ dt  t^n  ( -t )   _ h(t )  ,  r_n -  ,  ( n0 )  ; @xmath33 the subtracted sum rule ( ssr ) : [ ssr ] l_-1 ( ) = _ 0^  ( -t )   _ h(t ) + _ h(0 )  .",
    "the advantage of the laplace sum rules with respect to the previous dispersion relation is the presence of the exponential weight factor , which enhances the contribution of the lowest resonance and low - energy region accessible experimentally .",
    "for the qcd side , this procedure has eliminated the ambiguity carried by subtraction constants , arbitrary polynomial in @xmath3 , and has improved the convergence of the ope by the presence of the factorial dumping factor for each condensates of given dimensions .",
    "the ratio of the sum rules is a useful quantity to work with , in the determination of the resonance mass , as it is equal to the meson mass squared , in the usual duality ansatz parametrization .",
    "as one can notice , there are  a priori \" two free external parameters @xmath34 in the analysis .",
    "the optimized result will be ( in principle ) insensitive to their variations . in some cases",
    ", the @xmath31-stability is not reached due to the too nave parametrization of the spectral function .",
    "one can either fixed the @xmath31-values by the help of fesr ( local duality ) or improve the parametrization of the spectral function by introducing threshold effects fixed by chiral perturbation theory , ... , in order to restore the @xmath31-stability of the results .",
    "the results discussed below satisfy these stability criteria .",
    "in this paper , we shall consider the lowest - dimension gluonic currents that can be built from the gluon fields @xmath35 and which are gauge - invariant : _ ^&= & ( _ s ) g_g^+_u , d , sm_q|qq  ,   _ = -g_^g_+g _ g_g^ , + _ a^(x)&= &  g _ ^+_u ,",

    "@xcite are compared in table 1 with the ones from the lattice @xcite in the quenched approximation , where we use the conservative guessed estimate of about 15% for the different lattice systematic errors ( separation of the lowest ground states from the radial excitations , which are expected to be nearby as indicated by the sum rule analysis ; discretisation ; quenched approximation , ... ) .    .",
    "unmixed gluonia masses and couplings from qssr @xcite compared with the lattice . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one can notice an excellent agreement between the usr and the lattice quenched results , which the mass hierarchy : @xmath42 , expected from some qcd inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the whole story !",
    "we test the gluonic nature of the @xmath43 by determining its decay constant @xmath44 , from a saturation of the usr ( eq.[usr ] ) and ssr ( eq.[ssr ] ) pseusdoscalar sum rules by the @xmath0 , @xmath43 and the gluonium @xmath45 .",
    "one obtains @xcite a value of @xmath44 consistent with zero , in agreement with the estimate from the @xmath46 decays ( @xmath47 mev ) , and smaller than @xmath48 mev @xcite and @xmath49 mev .",
