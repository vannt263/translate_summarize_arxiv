    "2003 ) . to explain this , several possible polluters , i.e. , agb stars , stellar winds associated with massive stars during their early evolutionary phases and type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) have been suggested ( e.g. norris 2004 ; dantona et al 2005 ) .",
    "however , bekki & norris ( 2006 ) show that these candidates can not reproduce such a high _ helium abundance _ for reasonable initial mass functions ( imfs ) within the scheme of a closed - box self - enrichment .",
    "the acute point is not the high helium abundance itself but the high value of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 , because @xmath8 containing those candidates produce a large amount of metals as well as helium according to canonical stellar evolution models .",
    "maeder & meynet ( 2006 ) have recently suggested that `` moderately '' fast - rotating massive ( @xmath9 ) stars expel helium - dominant gas into space and thus could provide a solution to this problem .",
    "we show that this scenario provides a viable solution only if additional conditions on the mixing and escaping of metals are invoked .    as an alternative solution",
    ", we investigate the possibility that the late generation of `` the first stars '' ( population iii ) might affect the chemical mixture of the minority of population ii stars .",
    "we are particularly inspired by the work of bromm & loeb ( 2006 ) that suggested an overlap between the population iii and ii star formation episodes .",
    "the chemical yields of such supposedly - heavy , zero - metal stars have been computed by marigo , chiosi , & kudritzki ( 2003 ) .",
    "we present in this letter the result of our investigation .",
    "in order to investigate the pattern of the helium enhancement in a population , we employ a simple chemical evolution code and a realistic initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we describe a simple chemical enrichment model essentially following the formalism of tinsley ( 1980 ) and reduce a set of a few parameters following the formalism of ferreras & silk ( 2000 , 2001 ) .",

    ", gas infall has been considered as a solution ( larson 1972 ) .",
    "some cold gas is heated to high temperature by supernovae and/or agn and can be driven out : outflows .",
    "it is also an important factor to the final chemical properties of galaxies ( larson 1974 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) .",
    "we use a free parameter @xmath23 that represents the fraction of gas ejected following the formalism of ferreras & silk ( 2000 ) .",
    "this parameter should be a function of the mass of the galaxy , whose potential well determines whether the winds are strong enough to escape its gravitational potential .",
    "there are five input parameters : @xmath15 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 with the following initial conditions : the initial metallicity @xmath24 and the initial helium of stars and gas @xmath25 , the imf slopes and cutoffs .",

    "we approximate it by a polynomial fit to the @xmath35 prediction of maeder ( 1992 ) . in figure 1 , we show maeder s chemical yields for metal - poor ( @xmath37 ) stars and our fitting functions . for our reference model , we use these chemical yields .",
    "we also show the metal yields of extremely metal - poor ( @xmath38 ) rotating stars ( maeder & meynet 2006 ) in dotted line .",
    "maeder & meynet computed the yields for @xmath39 stars , and in order to domonstrate their effects to the @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 of an integrated population , we set up an extreme assumption that the newly - proposed metal yields may be applicable to all heavy stars of @xmath40 .    the crucial point shown here",
    "is that canonical stellar models _ produce and spread into space metals as well as helium . _",
    "no combination of these stars can produce @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 that exceeds the values of the constituent stars .",
    "the rotating metal - poor massive star models by maeder & meynet ( 2006 ) are exception and indeed can produce high values of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 .",

    "we have tried the most up - to - date sn ia rate of scannapieco & bildsten ( 2005 ) , consisting of two components : star formation rate and the total stellar mass of the system .",
    "the contribution by sne ia is negative to our study because they are copious producers of metals .",
    "we remove its effects for simplicity .",
    "we have found that gas infall or outflows of the processed material have negligible impacts on @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 unless specific chemical elements alone ( e.g. , helium or metals ) are affected .",
    "hence , only the closed - box model is considered .",
    "the star formation efficiency parameter @xmath15 has a small effect .",
    "when a range @xmath15 = 0.1  5.0 @xmath45 is considered , a population can reach @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath46  2 after a 1  gyr evolution .",
    "we show a typical case of @xmath47 in figure 2 as a solid line .",
    "the value of our reference model is consistent with the most recent observational mean value of the helium enrichment parameter of the galactic gas .",
    "having failed to recover the high @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 in the standard chemical enrichment model , we consider the stochastic effect in the helium yields @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that the stars in a specific mass range can have larger values of @xmath48 than the current stellar physics suggest .",
    "2 presents part of the result of the stochastic - effect test , where @xmath47 is assumed ; ( 1 ) when @xmath49 is doubled for all the stars , ( 2 ) when @xmath49 is doubled for 6  10   @xmath30 stars , maximising the agb effect , and ( 3 ) when @xmath49 is doubled for 40 ",
    "50   @xmath30 stars , allowing the sn ii effect to dominate .",
    "lastly , the triple - dot dashed line is for the model where all heavy stars ( @xmath40 ) are fast - rotating showing yields of maeder & meynet ( 2006 ) . because instant recycling of chemical elements is unrealistic",
    ", we use the chemical mixing time scale of 50  myr .",
    "the @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 after a 13 gyr evolution of the agb - dominant system is merely @xmath50 times greater than that of the reference system .",
    "the effect is even smaller for the sne ii dominant system .",
    "even if we double the values of @xmath48 for all stars , the system could attain only @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath51 .",
    "but of course , for our purpose , we need a much higher helium enrichment within a much shorter timescale ( @xmath52  gyr ) .     is doubled for ( 1 ) all stars , ( 2 ) 6  10  @xmath30 stars ( agb progenitors ) stars , and ( 3 ) 40 - 50   @xmath30 ( sn ii progenitors ) .",
    "finally , triple - dot dashed line shows the model that assumes that all heavy stars ( @xmath40 ) are fast - rotating showing yields of maeder & meynet ( 2006 ) .",
    "all models are for the case of @xmath47 and the chemical mixing time scale of 50  myr .",
    "[ fig2],width=302 ]    doubling the helium yields is ad hoc and hard to justify in terms of nucleosynthesis . even in this unphysical test , however , the stochastic effect does not help us achieve the high @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 .",
    "this is because ( 1 ) ordinary stars produce and spread into space not only helium but also metals and ( 2 ) most notably in the case of the `` maeder & meynet case '' , there are many more low - mass stars in the ordinary imf than massive stars",
    ".    other possible contributing factors , e.g. , imf slope and the remnant mass @xmath53 , also have some influence .",
    "one may wonder about the effect of radically - different imfs ( e.g. , with a reversed slope ) .",
    "this indeed would produce more helium but even more metals in ordinary stellar populations , hence in fact lowering the resulting value of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "a reversed imf slope would dramatically increase @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 in the `` maeder & meynet case '' .",
    "however , this should not be common because otherwise all populations with massive stars should have enhanced helium .    when assuming that the helium enrichment of @xmath6 of @xmath0  cen is due to the ejecta from the @xmath7 formed earlier , the candidate solution is even more severely constrained . for example , low - mass stars which produce mainly helium can generate high values of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 upto @xmath54 but they take much too long to spread the processed materials into space , when compared to the age difference between the two sub - systems in @xmath0  cen , i.e. , 12  gyr ( lee et al .",
    "any star whose lifetime is longer than this would have no impact at all .",
    "the `` maeder & meynet case '' is noteworthy as it is the only scenario where high values of @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 can be achieved during a short period of time . assuming all stars form simultaneously in a population",
    ", @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath4 can be as high as we need during the first few myr until intermediate - mass stars begin to spread a large amount of gas into space . in this sense",
    ", this scenario provides a solution if the @xmath6 population of @xmath0  cen is only slightly younger than its @xmath7 population .",
    "however , the time window ( @xmath55  yr ) for this to happen is very small compared to the constraint from cmd studies ( lee et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the possibility of difference in the effect of stellar wind for helium and metals demands further studies , and the role of the local black hole accretion on metals may also be noteworthy ( maeder & meynet 2006 ) .",

    ", we need at least @xmath84 vmos simultaneously .",
    "however , abel , bryan , & norman ( 2002 ) suggest that metal - free stars form in isolation due to the immense radiation from the first - forming star .",

    "this stochastic effect works only on small scales and not in the galactic scale .",
