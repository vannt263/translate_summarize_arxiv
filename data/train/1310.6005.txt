    ", the helmholtz equation ( [ pde ] ) governs many macroscopic wave phenomena in the frequency domain including wave propagation , guiding , radiation and scattering .",
    "the numerical solution to the helmholtz equation plays a vital role in a wide range of applications in electromagnetics , optics , and acoustics , such as antenna analysis and synthesis , radar cross section calculation , simulation of ground or surface penetrating radar , design of optoelectronic devices , acoustic noise control , and seismic wave propagation .",
    "however , it remains a challenge to design robust and efficient numerical algorithms for the helmholtz equation , especially when large wave numbers or highly oscillatory solutions are involved @xcite .    for the helmholtz problem ( [ pde])-([bc ] ) , the corresponding variational form is given by seeking @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in a classic finite element procedure ,",
    "continuous polynomials are used to approximate the true solution @xmath11 . in many situations ,",
    "the use of discontinuous functions in the finite element approximation often provides the methods with much needed flexibility to handle more complicated practical problems .",
    "however , for discontinuous polynomials , the strong gradient @xmath12 in ( [ wf ] ) is no longer meaningful .",
    "recently developed weak galerkin finite element methods @xcite provide means to solve this difficulty by replacing the differential operators by the weak forms as distributions for discontinuous approximating functions .",
    "weak galerkin ( wg ) methods refer to general finite element techniques for partial differential equations and were first introduced and analyzed in @xcite for second order elliptic equations . through rigorous error analysis , optimal order of convergence of the wg solution in both discrete @xmath13 norm and @xmath14 norm",
    "is established under minimum regularity assumptions in @xcite .",
    "the mixed weak galerkin finite element method is studied in @xcite .",
    "the wg methods are by design using discontinuous approximating functions .    in this paper",
    ", we will apply wg finite element methods @xcite to the helmholtz equation . the wg finite element approximation to ( [ wf ] )",
    "can be derived naturally by simply replacing the differential operator gradient @xmath12 in ( [ wf ] ) by a weak gradient @xmath15 : find @xmath16 such that for all @xmath17 we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the values of @xmath21 in the interior and the boundary of the triangle respectively .",
    "the weak gradient @xmath15 will be defined precisely in the next section .",

    ", we will investigate its performance for solving the helmholtz problems with large wave numbers .",
    "it is well known that the numerical performance of any finite element solution to the helmholtz equation depends significantly on the wave number @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath22 is very large  representing a highly oscillatory wave , the mesh size @xmath23 has to be sufficiently small for the scheme to resolve the oscillations . to keep a fixed grid resolution , a natural rule is to choose @xmath24 to be a constant in the mesh refinement , as the wave number @xmath22 increases @xcite",
    "however , it is known @xcite that , even under such a mesh refinement , the errors of continuous galerkin finite element solutions deteriorate rapidly when @xmath22 becomes larger .",
    "this non - robust behavior with respect to @xmath22 is known as the `` pollution effect '' .    to the end of alleviating the pollution effect ,",
    "various continuous or discontinuous finite element methods have been developed in the literature for solving the helmholtz equation with large wave numbers @xcite .",
    "a commonly used strategy in these effective finite element methods is to include some analytical knowledge of the helmholtz equation , such as characteristics of traveling plane wave solutions , asymptotic solutions or fundamental solutions , into the finite element space . likewise",
    ", analytical information has been incorporated in the basis functions of the boundary element methods to address the high frequency problems @xcite . on the other hand , many spectral methods , such as local spectral methods @xcite , spectral galerkin methods @xcite , and spectral element methods @xcite have also been developed for solving the helmholtz equation with large wave numbers .",
    "pollution effect can be effectively controlled in these spectral type collocation or galerkin formulations , because the pollution error is directly related to the dispersion error , i.e. , the phase difference between the numerical and exact waves @xcite , while the spectral methods typically produce negligible dispersive errors .",
    "the objective of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we will introduce weak galerkin methods for the helmholtz equation .",
    "the second aim of the paper is to investigate the performance of the wg methods for solving the helmholtz equation with high wave numbers . to demonstrate the potential of the wg finite element methods in solving high frequency problems",
    ", we will not attempt to build the analytical knowledge into the wg formulation ( [ wg1 ] ) and we will restrict ourselves to low order wg elements .",
    "we will investigate the robustness and effectiveness of such plain wg methods through many carefully designed numerical experiments .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will introduce a weak galerkin finite element formulation for the helmholtz equation by following the idea presented in @xcite .",

    "we will find a locally defined discrete weak gradient from this space on each element @xmath27 .",
    "the main idea of the weak galerkin method is to introduce weak derivatives for discontinuous functions and to use them in discretizing the corresponding variational forms such as ( [ wf ] ) .",
    "the differential operator used in ( [ wf ] ) is a gradient .",

    "the homogeneous helmholtz problem of the subsection [ convex ] will be studied again .",
    "also , the @xmath115 and @xmath116 elements are used to solve the homogeneous helmholtz equation with the robin boundary condition . since this problem is defined on a structured hexagon domain , a uniform triangular mesh with a constant mesh size @xmath23 throughout the domain is used .",
    "this enables us to precisely evaluate the impact of the mesh refinements .",

    ", we also show the errors of different @xmath22 values by fixing @xmath123 .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the relative @xmath13 error does not evidently increase as @xmath22 becomes larger .",
    "the convergence line for @xmath123 looks almost flat , with a very little slope .",
    "in other words , the pollution error is very small in the present wg result .",
    "we note that such a result is as good as the one reported in @xcite by using a penalized discontinuous galerkin approach with optimized parameter values .",
    "in contrast , no parameters are involved in the wg scheme . on the other hand",
    ", the good performance of the wg method for the case @xmath123 does not mean that the wg method could be free of pollution effect .",

    "[ fig.kh ] , we examine the numerical errors by increasing @xmath22 , under the constraint that @xmath24 is a constant . huge wave numbers , up to @xmath124 , are tested .",
    "it can be seen that when the constant changes from @xmath125 to @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the non - robustness behavior against @xmath22 becomes more and more evident .",
    "however , the slopes of @xmath24=constant lines remain to be small and the increment pattern with respect to @xmath22 is always monotonic .",
    "this suggests that the pollution error is well controlled in the wg solution .",

    "we take a wave number @xmath120 and mesh size @xmath128 which is relatively a coarse mesh .",
    "with such a coarse mesh , the wg method can still capture the fast oscillation of the solution .",
    "however , the numerically predicted magnitude of the oscillation is slightly damped for waves away from the center when piecewise constant elements are employed in the wg method .",
    "such damping can be seen in a trace plot along @xmath129-axis or @xmath130 . to see this",

    "the result is shown in the first chart of fig .",
    "[ fig.solu1d ] .",
    "we note that the numerical solution is excellent around the center of the region , but it gets worse as one moves closer to the boundary .",
    "if we choose a smaller mesh size @xmath132 , the visual difference between the exact and wg solutions becomes very small , as illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig.solu1d ] .",
    "if we further choose a mesh size @xmath133 , the exact solution and the wg approximation look very close to each other .",
    "this indicates an excellent convergence of the wg method when the mesh is refined .",
    "in addition to mesh refinement , one may also obtain a fast convergence by using high order elements in the wg method .",
    "figure [ fig.solu1d_linear ] illustrates a trace plot for the case of @xmath120 and @xmath128 when piecewise linear elements are employed in the wg method .",
    "it can be seen that the computational result with this relatively coarse mesh captures both the fast oscillation and the magnitude of the exact solution very well .",
    "the present numerical experiments indicate that the wg method as introduced in @xcite is a very promising numerical technique for solving the helmholtz equations with large wave numbers .",
    "this finite element method is robust , efficient , and easy to implement . on the other hand , a theoretical investigation for the wg method",
    "should be conducted by taking into account some useful features of the helmholtz equation when special test functions are used .",
    "it would also be valuable to test the performance of the wg method when high order finite elements are employed to the helmholtz equations with large wave numbers in two and three dimensional spaces .    finally , it is appropriate to clarify some differences and connections between the wg method and other discontinuous finite element methods for solving the helmholtz equation .",
    "discontinuous functions are used to approximate the helmholtz equation in many other finite element methods such as discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods @xcite and hybrid discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) methods @xcite",
    ".    however , the wg method and the hdg method are fundamentally different in concept and formulation .",
    "the hdg method is formulated by using the standard mixed method approach for the usual system of first order equations , while the key to the wg is the use of the discrete weak differential operators . for a second order elliptic",
    "problem , these two methods share the same feature by approximating first order derivatives or fluxes through a formula that was commonly employed in the mixed finite element method . for high order partial differential equations ( pdes ) ,",
    "the wg method is greatly different from the hdg .",
    "consider the biharmonic equation @xcite as an example .",
    "the first step of the hdg formulation is to rewrite the fourth order equation to four first order equations . in contrast",
    ", the wg formulation for the biharmonic equation can be derived directly from the variational form of the biharmonic equation by replacing the laplacian operator @xmath134 by a weak laplacian @xmath135 and adding a parameter free stabilizer @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the concept of weak derivatives makes the wg a widely applicable numerical technique for a large variety of pdes which we shall report in forthcoming papers .    for the helmholtz equation studied in this paper , the wg method and",
    "the hdg method yield the same variational form for the homogeneous helmholtz equation with a constant @xmath136 in ( [ pde ] ) .",
