    "many interesting results in the area of 2d quantum gravity have been obtained by studying models of matter fields coupled to dynamical triangulations . however , all the exactly solved models have had central charges , @xmath2 , of less than or equal to one ( if one ignores models for which @xmath3  @xcite ) .",
    "using conformal field theory it is possible to make predictions for the critical exponents in models of matter coupled to 2d gravity  @xcite , the so - called `` kpz formulae '' , but again these formulae are only valid for @xmath4 . the nature of this `` @xmath5 barrier '' remains something of a mystery .",
    "many models of matter coupled to gravity have a tendency to degenerate into branched polymer configurations for large enough @xmath2 .",
    "it is thus tempting to hypothesise that a branched polymer phase begins at @xmath5 , causing the break down of the kpz formulae here .",
    "models in which multiple ising spins are coupled to dynamical triangulations ( or their dual 3 graphs ) provide a convenient way of testing this hypothesis ; such a model with @xmath6 independent ising spins on each vertex of the graph , has a central charge of @xmath7 associated with it .",
    "however , monte carlo simulations for values of @xmath6 up to @xmath8  @xcite have failed to show any convincing evidence of the existence of such a branched polymer ( `` bp '' ) phase .",
    "since there are reasons to believe that such a phase exists  @xcite , there are two possibilities to consider : firstly , that there exists an intermediate region between @xmath5 and the start of the branched polymer phase , or secondly , that the bp phase does indeed start at @xmath5 and that the mc simulations have for some reason failed to detect it .",
    "this paper aims to throw some light on the question by examining the branchedness of the graphs for various exactly solvable models .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we studied correlation functions in a model of multiple ising spins on a dynamical planar 3 graph . in the paper ,",
    "a function @xmath9 was defined which played a key rle in the calculation of the critical exponents ; @xmath9 gives a measure of how branched the 3 graphs contributing to the partition function are and hereafter it will be called the `` branching ratio '' .",
    "the branching ratio lies in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and throughout the branched polymer phase @xmath9 equals one , when evaluated at the critical value of the cosmological constant .",
    "thus the branching ratio gives a measure of how close to the bp phase we are , and by evaluating it for various models we will gain some indication of the extent of the branched polymer phase for the multiple ising model coupled to gravity .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the branching ratio , which is defined in the next section , for three different models ( all of which are defined in terms of planar 3 graphs ) : pure gravity ( section  [ sec : puregrav ] ) , the @xmath12 gaussian model coupled to gravity ( section  [ sec : gaussian ] ) and the single spin ising model coupled to gravity ( section  [ sec : ising ] ) . as might be expected the branching ratio increases with increasing central charge . in section  [ sec : concl ] we conclude by using these results to make a prediction of the location of the branched polymer phase for the multiple ising model coupled to gravity ; it is estimated that there exists a bp phase for central charges above some value @xmath13 , where @xmath13 lies in the range @xmath14 .",
    "in our previous paper  @xcite we used a simplified definition of distance rather than the usual geodesic distance .",
    "the geodesic distance between two vertices @xmath15 and @xmath9 of a 3 graph is defined to be the shortest path along links , from @xmath15 to @xmath9 , counting one unit of distance for each link traversed . however ,",
    "in our definition of distance , only links separating two one - particle irreducible ( `` 1pi '' ) subgraphs are counted ; figure  [ fig : measure ] gives an example , each shaded circle represents a 1pi subgraph , hereafter referred to as a `` blob '' .",
    "( 100,55)(0,0 )    using this definition of distance it was possible to show that the number of blobs at a distance @xmath16 from the root , denoted @xmath17 , was given by @xmath18 , where @xmath9 is a function of the various parameters in the model .",
    "for the case of a single ising spin coupled to each vertex of a graph ( using the set , @xmath19 , of all rooted planar 3 graphs ) , we derived the following formula for @xmath9  @xcite , [ eqn : fullb ] b(x,)= , where @xmath20 .",
    "the grand canonical partition function for the single spin ising model on the set of graphs @xmath19 is defined by [ eqn : general ] ( x , ) = _ g x^n _ \\{s } _",

    ". this will be referred to as model  i. the coupling constant @xmath24 is the inverse temperature of the model and each vertex in the graph is weighted with a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "the first summation is over graphs @xmath26 in the set @xmath19 , where @xmath27 is the number of vertices in @xmath26 , the second summation is over all spin configurations and the product is over nearest neighbour pairs .",
    "note that there is no spin at the end of the root and hence the root link is not included in this product .",
    "the partition function @xmath28 is defined as in ( [ eqn : general ] ) , but using the set of planar rooted 1pi 3 graphs , @xmath29 ; this will be called model  ii . the renormalized coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by [ eqn : fullmap ] x = x(1 - 2xt)^- , t = t and the following equation which relates @xmath32 and @xmath33 was derived in our paper  @xcite , [ eqn : fullf ] t=  ( x, ) + x t^2 .",
    "in the case of pure gravity ( that is , equation ( [ eqn : general ] ) with @xmath34 ) equation ( [ eqn : fullb ] ) reduces to [ eqn : pgb ] b(x)= .",
    "we are interested in evaluating this at the critical value of @xmath25 for model  i , which is denoted by @xmath35 . from reference",

    "the corresponding value of @xmath31 is @xmath38 and in reference  @xcite it was shown that .",

    ", we have that the branching ratio at the critical value of @xmath25 is b_c = 1- 0.4226 for pure gravity , with rooted planar 3 graphs ; this model , of course , corresponds to a central charge of zero .",
    "in this section we will derive @xmath39 for the gaussian model in @xmath1 dimensions , which has a central charge of @xmath41 . for this choice of @xmath42",
    "the partition function has an especially simple form  @xcite , ( x ) = _ g _ t x^n . again",
    "the set @xmath19 of all rooted planar 3 graphs is being used and in addition there is a summation over the trees @xmath43 in the set of all trees spanning @xmath26 ; this set is denoted by @xmath44 .",

    "-1 ^ 1 dt ( 1 - ) , which has a critical value of @xmath25 given by @xmath45 . at this critical value , ( ) = 4 ( 1 - ) , . _ = 32 ( -1 ) and @xmath46 diverges .",
    "( 100,25)(0,0 )    a formula for @xmath47 in this model can be obtained by using a derivation similar to that for the multiple ising model  @xcite .",
    "define a function , @xmath48 , which takes a rooted 1pi blob ( both graphs and spanning trees are being summed over in the blob ) and glues an arbitrary number of legs , each weighted with a factor @xmath49 , on to the blob .",
    "again we define @xmath50 to save writing and have that @xmath51 , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : tft ] . to derive a formula for @xmath48 we need to consider the effect of adding an arbitrary number of legs to a link . for a given graph @xmath26 and spanning tree @xmath43 there are two different types of link , those that form part of the spanning tree , which will be referred to as `` black '' links ( drawn as thick lines ) , and those which are not part of the spanning tree ( these are called `` white '' and drawn as thin lines ) . adding legs to a black link",
    "changes the contribution it makes to the partition function ( fig  [ fig : blwh]a ) : 1 1 + 2xy + ( 2xy)^2 + = . for each leg added there is a weight of @xmath49 , a weight of @xmath25 for the extra vertex and a factor of @xmath52 , since the leg can be hung from the link in one of two directions ; this accounts for the factors of @xmath53 .",
    "similarly for white links there is the change ( fig  [ fig : blwh]b ) : 1 1 + 2(2xy ) + 3(2xy)^2 + 4 ( 2xy)^3 + = . in this case",
    "one must also take into account the different ways of connecting the new legs to the existing spanning tree .",
    "( 100,55)(0,0 )    the partition function for rooted 1pi blobs is defined by ( x ) = _ g _ t x^n .",
    "adding legs to this changes the partition function for the blob to _",
    "t x^n ( 1 - 2xy)^-(l_b+2l_w ) , where the number of black links is @xmath54 and the number of white links is @xmath55 .",
    "thus @xmath56 and hence f(y)= xy^2 + ( x(1 - 2xy)^-2 ) .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath57 .",

    "_ y = t , so that , with @xmath60 , [ eqn : bgau ] b(x)= 2 x . differentiating the equation @xmath51 with respect to @xmath31 yields an expression for @xmath61 and",
    "then evaluating ( [ eqn : bgau ] ) at @xmath58 gives b_c= 1- 0.1670 , for the @xmath1 gaussian model .",
    "finally , we will calculate the branching ratio for the ising model on planar 3 graphs with a single spin per vertex ; the matter in this model has a central charge of @xmath62 . to use equation ( [ eqn : fullb ] )",
    "we need the partition functions for both model  i and model  ii , which we obtain by solving the following two - matrix model , @xmath63 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath9 are @xmath64 hermitian matrices and we wish to take the planar limit in which @xmath65 .",

    "@xmath69 , @xmath70 will give the model  i partition function up to various factors ; this has been solved in references  @xcite . alternatively by choosing @xmath71 so that graphs with tadpoles are cancelled , we gain the partition function for model  ii .",
    "this matrix model can be solved using orthogonal polynomials  @xcite . in the planar limit and dropping the constant term , we have @xmath72 - ( ) ^2 ( 1+_0 ) , where u g^2 = z ( ^2 -c^2 ) + 2cz^2 , z= and @xmath73 is @xmath74 evaluated at @xmath75 ( i.e.  at @xmath76 ) , _ 0= -c- .",

    "we see that the graphs tend to become more branched as the central charge increases .",
    "this is not unexpected since many models coupled to gravity degenerate to branched polymers for large enough central charge .",
    "one should perhaps note at this point that @xmath39 is not a universal function of the central charge , so that different models with @xmath96 will in general have different branching ratios .",
    "thus the data point for the gaussian model is probably not very reliable when trying to determine the behaviour of the multiple ising model .",
