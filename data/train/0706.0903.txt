    "the example is motivated by appearance of a particular type of traveling wave solutions , which is absent in the separable models .",
    "we suppose that @xmath194 if @xmath195 then we have the keller - segel model studied in section 3.2 .    the wave system for with the functions given by reads @xmath196 where we put parameter @xmath25 equal zero .",
    "after the change of the independent variable @xmath197 system takes the form @xmath198 if @xmath199 then system has a line on non - isolated singular points @xmath200 ; if @xmath201 then @xmath174 is an isolated non - hyperbolic singular point of ( i.e. , both eigenvalues of the jacobian evaluated at this point are zero ) .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath199 .",
    "after yet another transformation @xmath202 we obtain @xmath203 thus for @xmath187 and @xmath204 the origin is a node for system which implies that in the initial system there exist a family of bounded orbits which tent to @xmath176 for @xmath162 or @xmath163 .",
    "this family corresponds to a family of traveling wave solution of the system where @xmath19-profile is an impulse and @xmath20-profile is a free - boundary front .",
    "the picture is topologically equivalent to the phase portrait shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a .     the phase plane of system ; the parameters are @xmath205 .",
    "@xmath33 numerical solutions of system with the functions given by and the parameter values as in @xmath125 .",
    "the solutions are shown for the time moments @xmath206 in equal time intervals , scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for @xmath201 the wave system has singular point @xmath176 possessing two elliptic sectors in its neighborhood ( see fig . [",
    "fig:7]a ) .",
    "the proof of existence of the elliptic sectors can easily be conducted with the methods given in @xcite .",
    "asymptotics of homoclinics composing the elliptic sector are @xmath200 ( trivial ) and @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the biggest root of the equation @xmath209 the family of homoclinics in the phase plane @xmath106 correspond to the family of wave impulses for the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c and fig .",
    "[ fig:7]b ) . to our knowledge",
    "such kind of solutions ( infinitely many traveling wave solutions of impulse - impulse type with the fixed values of the parameters ) was not previously described in the literature .",
    "the results of the numerical computations ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7]b ) indicate that the family of traveling impulses is clearly non - stationary , since its amplitude decays visibly in time . which is important ,",
    "however , is that it is possible to observe moving impulses at least at a finite time interval .",
    "in this paper we described all possible traveling wave solutions @xmath210 of the cross - diffusion two - component pde model satisfying @xmath45 , where the cross - diffusion coefficient may depend on both variables and possess singularities .",
    "such kind of models is widely used in modeling populations that can chemotactically react to an immovable signal ( attractant ) ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the study of traveling wave solutions of model was carried out by qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the phase portraits of the wave system that depends on parameters @xmath15 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath15 is a speed of wave propagation and @xmath25 characterizes boundary conditions under given @xmath15",
    ". any traveling wave solution of with given boundary conditions corresponds to a solution of wave system with specific values of parameters @xmath15 and @xmath25 ; the converse is also true .",
    "therefore , instead of trying to construct a traveling wave solution with the given boundary conditions , we study the set of all possible bounded solutions of the wave system considering @xmath15 and @xmath25 as its parameters .",
    "this approach allows identifying all boundary conditions for which model possesses traveling wave solutions .",
    "the main attention is paid to the so - called separable model , i.e. , to model that satisfies @xmath45 ; it is worth noting that in this case the functions @xmath211 and @xmath212 in are products of factors that depend on a single variable .",
    "we showed that for some fixed values of parameters @xmath15 and @xmath25 the solutions of the wave system compose two - parameter family ( for explicit formulas in a simple particular case see ) .",
    "one result is that @xmath213-profiles of the wave solution of the reduced separable models that satisfies @xmath47 can be only front - front or front - impulse ; for more general case of the separable models we can additionally have impulse - front solutions . for some special relations between @xmath15 , @xmath25 and the model parameters model can have wave solutions whose @xmath20-profiles are free - boundary fronts , i.e. , @xmath18 tends to an arbitrary constant from some interval at @xmath74 or at @xmath75 . note that traveling wave solutions of the well - known keller - segel model @xcite as well as of its generalization ( section 3.3 ) have impulse - front profiles with a free - boundary front ( sections 3.2 , 3.3 ) .",
    "we also considered a natural extension of the separable models ; namely , we gave an example of model where @xmath214 are products of factors that depend on affine expression of both variables ( see ) .",
    "this model can be considered as a generalization of the keller - segel model because it has two additional parameters and turns into the keller - segel model if both of these parameters are zero .",
    "if only one of the parameters vanishes , the model has a family of `` keller - segel''-type solutions , i.e. , @xmath19-profile is an impulse and @xmath20-profile is a frond with a free boundary .",
    "importantly , in some parameter domains this model possesses a two - parameter family of impulse - impulse solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", such type of traveling wave solutions was not previously described in the literature : depending on the initial conditions traveling impulses can have quite a different form for the fixed values of the system parameters . taking into account the fact that such solutions are absent in the separable models , we can consider model with functions as the simplest model possessing this type of traveling wave solutions .",
    "rearrangements of traveling wave solutions of pde model , which occur with changes of the wave propagation velocity and the boundary conditions , correspond to bifurcations of its ode wave system .",
    "in particular , appearance / disappearance of front - profiles with variation of parameters @xmath15 and @xmath25 correspond to the fold or cusp bifurcations in the wave system ; rearrangement of a front to an impulse can be accompanied by appearance / disappearance of non - isolated singular points in the phase plane of the corresponding wave system ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "existence of non - isolated singular points in the wave system may result in the existence of free - boundary fronts in model .",
    "for instance , this is the case for the keller - segel model .",
    "we emphasize that the separable model , when the values of parameters @xmath15 and @xmath25 fixed in the wave system , possesses , in general , two - parameter family of traveling wave solutions .",
    "there are infinitely many bounded orbits of that correspond to traveling wave solutions of ( see figures [ fig:2 ] , [ fig:4 ] , [ fig:6 ] , [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "it is of particular interest that in all numerical solutions of that we conducted it is possible to observe traveling waves .",
    "we did not discuss the issue of stability of the traveling wave solutions found , but we note that it is usually true that unstable solutions can not be produced in numerical calculations .",
    "it is tempting to put forward a hypothesis that the presence of additional degrees of freedom ( two free parameters ) is the reason of producing traveling waves in numerical computations .",
    "this important question can be a subject of future research .",
    "we did numerical simulations of system for @xmath215 $ ] , where @xmath216 varied in different numerical experiments .",
    "we used no - flux boundary conditions for the spatial variable .",
    "inasmuch as we wanted to study the behavior of the traveling wave solutions in an infinite space we chose such space interval so that to avoid the influence of boundaries .",
    "we used an explicit difference scheme .",
    "the approximation of the taxis term is an `` upwind '' explicit scheme @xcite which is frequently used for cross - diffusion systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath217 where for the positive taxis ( pursuit ) ( i.e. , @xmath218 ) , @xmath219 for the negative taxis ( invasion ) : @xmath220 we used @xmath221 , @xmath222 .",
