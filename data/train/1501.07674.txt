    "double beta decay ( dbd ) is an important open problem of current interest .",
    "there are many experimental efforts @xcite and also theoretical studies ( see for example @xcite and references cited therein ) in particular for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the nuclear transition matrix elements ( ntme ) @xmath4 for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath5 ) are found to vary considerably in different nuclear models .",
    "for example , qrpa values are always larger than the shell model values .",
    "most variants of qrpa assume the nucleus to be spherical and hence they do not take into account the deformation of the nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , shell model takes into account all possible correlations , within the defined space , through the effective interaction .",
    "there are many studies which show that quadrupole deformation reduces the @xmath4 .",
    "some of them are as follows .",
    "( i ) energy density functional method including deformation and pairing fluctuations within the finite range density dependent gogny force @xcite where the authors show that deformation effects vary from @xmath6% in @xmath7se to as high as @xmath8% in @xmath9te .",
    "( ii ) the proton - neutron qrpa with a realistic residual interaction @xcite . ( iii )",
    "nuclear shell model @xcite where a quadrupole - quadrupole term is added to the effective interaction and the deformation effects were studied by varying the strength of the quadrupole term .",
    "in addition , there is also an attempt to study the effect of hexadecapole deformation @xcite . in this present report , we study the effect of changing from spherical to deformed shape on @xmath4 and @xmath2 half - lives , using realistic interactions within the deformed shell model ( dsm ) based on hartree - fock ( hf ) states . in the recent past",
    ", we have used dsm in the study dbd ( both @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) in a number of nuclei in the a=@xmath10 region @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we will discuss briefly the formulas for @xmath1 and @xmath2 half - lives and the dsm model .",
    "sections 3 and 4 give the results obtained using spherical and deformed shapes for @xmath0zn and @xmath3nd nuclei respectively .",
    "section 5 gives conclusions .",
    "half - life for @xmath1dbd for the 0@xmath11 ground state ( gs ) of a initial even - even nucleus decaying to the 0@xmath12 gs of the final even - even nucleus is given by @xcite  [ t_1/2 ^ 0(0^+_i 0^+_f ) ] ^-1 = g^0 (g_a)^4 | m^0 ( 0^+)|^2 ()^2 , [ eq.dbd1 ] where @xmath13 is the effective neutrino mass and @xmath14 is the phase space integral ( kinematical factor ) .",
    "the ntme @xmath4 is essentially a sum of a gamow - teller like ( @xmath15 ) and fermi like ( @xmath16 ) two - body operators ( we are neglecting other parts as in @xcite )",
    ". then , m^0 ( 0^+ ) = m^0_gt ( 0^+ ) - m^0_f ( 0^+ ) = 0^+_f ( 2:0 ) 0^+_i .",
    "[ eq.dbd2 ] as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq.dbd2 ] ) , @xmath1dbd half - lives are generated by the two - body transition operator @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the weak axial - vector and vector coupling constants . in our dsm analysis",
    ", we will use @xmath17 as given in @xcite and it contains the neutrino potential , jastrow factor and a scale factor three .",
    "it is important to mention that the results in the present paper are independent of the scale factor used in @xcite as we are studying only the ratio of @xmath4 for spherical and deformed shapes .",
    "( [ eq.dbd1 ] ) and ( [ eq.dbd2 ] ) are a result of the closure approximation and this is justified _ only if the exchange of the light majorana neutrino is indeed the mechanism responsible for the @xmath1dbd_.    for @xmath2 dbd , half - life for the @xmath20 decay is given by @xcite  [ t_1/2 ^ 2 ] ^-1 = g_2 |m_2|^2 .",

    "\\label{eqn20}\\ ] ] here , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the initial , final and virtual intermediate states respectively and @xmath27 are the energies of the intermediate nucleus . similarly , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the ground state energies of the parent and daughter nuclei ( see @xcite for further details ) .    we will use dsm to calculate @xmath30 using the known values for @xmath31 and the ntme @xmath4 for nuclei with close to spherical shape and with deformation . in dsm , for a given nucleus , starting with a model space consisting of a given set of single particle ( sp ) orbitals and effective two - body hamiltonian , the lowest energy intrinsic states are obtained by solving the hartree - fock ( hf ) single particle equation self - consistently .",
    "excited intrinsic configurations are obtained by making particle - hole excitations over the lowest intrinsic state .",
    "these intrinsic states do not have definite angular momenta and hence states of good angular momentum are projected from them .",
    "these good angular momentum states projected from different intrinsic states are not in general orthogonal to each other .",
    "hence they are orthonormalized and then band mixing calculations are performed .",
    "dsm is well established to be a successful model for transitional nuclei ( with a=60 - 90 ) when sufficiently large number of intrinsic states are included in the band mixing calculations .",
    "for details see @xcite and references there in .",
    "in the dsm calculations for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ntme for @xmath0zn , used is the model space consisting of the orbitals @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36ni as the core .",
    "it is important to add that the same model space was used in many recent shell model and interacting boson model calculations @xcite for @xmath37ge and @xmath7se nuclei and @xmath0zn is in the same region . within this space",
    "we have employed two effective interactions .",
    "these are the jj44b interaction given in @xcite with spherical single particle energies for the four orbits being @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 mev respectively and the jun45 interaction given in @xcite with spherical single particle energies for the four orbits being @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 mev respectively . with these ,",
    "we have first carried out axially symmetric hf calculations for the parent and the daughter nuclei @xmath0zn and @xmath0ge ( for @xmath2dbd , also for the intermediate odd - odd nucleus @xmath0ga ) for each of the two effective interactions .",
    "the lowest energy hf solutions obtained using jj44b and jun45 interactions for @xmath0zn are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and similarly for @xmath0ge in fig .",
    "it is clearly seen from the hf spectra in figs . 1 and 2 that @xmath46 generates deformed solutions for the ground state of @xmath0zn and @xmath0ge .",
    "note that the mass quadruple moment given in the figure gives a measure of deformation . with jj44b interaction , the dsm calculated energy spectra for these two nuclei",
    "are compressed compared to the experimental spectrum .",
    "for example , for @xmath0zn the calculated @xmath47 is 0.355 mev compared to the experimental value 0.885 mev and similarly for @xmath0ge they are 0.64 mev and 1.04 mev respectively @xcite .",
    "but , at the same time the calculated @xmath48 ( 14 w.u . and 18.8 w.u . for @xmath0zn and @xmath0ga",
    "respectively ) are in close agreement with data ( 16.5 w.u . and 20.9 w.u .",
    "respectively ) .",
    "these results are reported in @xcite . on the other hand , as seen from figs . 1 and 2 , the jun45 interaction generates nearly spherical solutions for these two nuclei .",
    "for this interaction , the spectrum is in close agreement with data but the @xmath49 is much smaller than data value ; see fig .",
    "both the calculated energy spectra and @xmath50 values show that jj44b generates deformed shape and jun45 generates spherical shape .",
    "therefore , calculations of ntme for @xmath1 and @xmath2 using these interactions will give information about shape effects on ntme .",
    "in the dsm calculations of @xmath1 ntme using jj44b interaction , we have considered 30 lowest intrinsic states with @xmath52 for @xmath0zn , 26 lowest intrinsic configurations with @xmath53 for the daughter nucleus @xmath0ge ( up to 6 mev excitation in both nuclei ) by making particle - hole excitations over the lowest hf intrinsic states generated for these nuclei .",
    "we project out @xmath54 states from each of these intrinsic states and then perform band mixing calculations as discussed above .",
    "similarly for jun45 we have considered 81 lowest intrinsic states with @xmath52 for @xmath0zn , 68 lowest intrinsic configurations with @xmath53 for the daughter nucleus @xmath0ge ( up to 5 mev excitation in both nuclei ) by making particle - hole excitations over the lowest hf intrinsic states generated for these nuclei . with jj44b interaction ,",
    "the ntme @xmath4 comes out to be 2.13 .",
    "however , for jun45 interaction the value is 4.56 .",
    "thus we see a reduction by a factor @xmath55 in @xmath4 as we go from spherical to deformed shape .",
    "thus dsm is consistent with other theoretical calculations mentioned in section 1 . for further confirmation of this result",
    "we will turn @xmath2 ntme .    for @xmath2 dbd ,",
    "firstly as discussed in @xcite , @xmath56 =   [ 1.1537 + e_{1^+}]$ ] mev and dsm is used to calculate @xmath57 for the intermediate nucleus @xmath0ga as well as the numerator in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eqn20 ] ) . in the dsm calculations using jj44b and jun45 interactions ,",
    "we have considered the same intrinsic states for @xmath0zn and @xmath0ge as in the calculation of @xmath1 ntme given above .",
    "in addition , for the intermediate nucleus @xmath0ga , 65 intrinsic states with @xmath58 or @xmath53 are used for jj44b interaction and 114 intrinsic states with jun45 interaction .",
    "these are generated by making particle - hole excitations over the lowest hf intrinsic state generated for this nucleus .",
    "we project out @xmath59 states from each of these intrinsic states and then perform a band mixing calculation as discussed above .",
    "taking the phase space factor @xmath60 yr@xmath61 given in @xcite , the dsm value for @xmath51 is @xmath62 yr for jj44b interaction and @xmath63 yr for jun45 interaction .",
    "thus , for @xmath2 dbd also the ntme ( proportional to inverse of the half - life ) is reduced by a factor of @xmath64 as we go from spherical ( jun45 ) to deformed ( jj44b ) shape .",
    "we then considered the double beta decay of @xmath3nd as another example . in the calculation of @xmath3nd and the daughter nucleus @xmath3sm , we used modified kuo - herling interaction @xcite with a z = 50 , n = 82 core .",
    "the protons are in the @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbits with spherical single particle energies -7.92783 , -7.95519 , -8.67553 , -9.59581 and -6.83792 mev , respectively .",
    "the neutrons are in the @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 orbits with spherical single particle energies for these orbits -1.050 , -1.625 , -1.964 , -2.380 , -0.895 and -0.261 mev , respectively .",
    "the model space used here is same as in the recent interacting boson model calculations @xcite .",
    "as described before , we obtain the lowest energy hf configuration by solving the axially symmetric hf equation self - considently .",
    "the lowest energy hf solutions for @xmath3nd and @xmath3sm obtained with this interaction are shown in figures [ nd150hf ] and [ sm150hf ] .",
    "as seen from the quadrupole moments , both the nuclei have large deformations .",
    "to generate hf intrinsic states with nearly spherical shape , we artificially decreased the effective interation to 1/10th of its value and perform axially symmetric hf calculation as described above .",
    "these nearly spherical hf single particle states are shown in figures [ nd150hf ] and [ sm150hf ] . as expected ,",
    "these two solutions have small quadrupole moment and hence small deformation .",
    "we then proceed to calculate @xmath1 ntme with the deformed and spherical solutions , separately . for the deformed solutions",
    ", we considered 38 intrinsic states with @xmath52 for @xmath3nd .",
    "similarly we consider 17 intrinsic states with @xmath52 for the daughter nucleus @xmath3sm . now",
    ", the ntme @xmath4 comes out to be 1.35 . then in the second case where we reduced the effective interaction matrix elements by a factor of 10 , we considered 62 intrinsic states both for the parent and the daughter nuclei .",
    "the ntme @xmath4 comes out to be 3.06 .",
    "thus in this case also the @xmath1 nuclear matrix element increases by a factor of 2.33 as we go from deformed to spherical shape .",
    "we have demonstrated using dsm model and @xmath0zn as the example and employing two realistic effective interactions , namely jj44b that produces deformed shape and jun45 that generates spherical shape , that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 ntme for double beta decay will reduce considerably as we go from spherical shapes to deformed shapes .",
    "this result is further confirmed by a calculation of @xmath1 ntme for @xmath3nd .",
    "our results reported in this paper are an important addition , since the calculations are performed using two realistic interactions proposed for the same model space and dsm is transperent in determining shapes , to the existing analysis of deformation effects on ntme for dbd .",
    "we would like to mention that since we have not included all the spin - orbit partners in the basis space , the ikeda sum rule is not satisfied in our calculations .",
    "however , as mentioned before , many recent shell model and interacting boson model calculations @xcite used the same model space .",
    "violation of ikeda sum rule may not be a serious deficiency in our calculations since we are only studying the change in double beta decay matrix elements with the change of nuclear shape .",
    "calculations using much larger set of single particle orbits ( these also need new effective interactions ) are for future .",
