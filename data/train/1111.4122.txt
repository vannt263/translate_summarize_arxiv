    "our studies show that the reversible beam heater system proposed here can suppress microbunching instabilities and preserve the high beam brightness at the same time . due to csr effects , some vertical emittance degradation in the head and tail region of the bunch occurs , but the core emittances are well preserved . in the numerical demonstrations using the code , the first tds generates about 10kev ( r.m.s . ) slice energy spread , which is similar to the laser heater but with a more gaussian energy distribution ( cf .",

    "the bunch compression process increases the slice energy spread to @xmath111130kev ( r.m.s . ) , which is then reversed to @xmath11117kev ( r.m.s . ) after the second tds in the presence of csr effects . without csr effects",

    "the resulting smooth beam can then propagate through the remaining accelerator without further generation of much additional energy spread and is advantageous for any kind of laser seeding manipulations and experiments .",

    "in addition , the reversible beam heater system exhibits integrated options for diagnosis and on - line monitoring of the longitudinal phase space applicable for multi - bunch machines , which is also the preferred type of accelerator for the reversible heater system due to large sensitivities on energy and rf jitter .",
