    "the electroweak standard model  ( sm ) has proven to be extremely successful in describing the hitherto collected data from particle physics experiments .",
    "however , we are still waiting for the forthcoming lhc experiments to find the first direct experimental evidence for the detailed dynamics behind electroweak symmetry breaking  ( ewsb ) . in the minimal sm",
    ", ewsb is accomplished by the condensation of a fundamental scalar higgs field , but the corresponding particle has , so far , eluded detection at lep and the tevatron . while the minimal  sm with a rather light higgs particle describes the electroweak precision data very well , any model with just a light fundamental scalar is not natural when a much higher scale exists , such as the grand unification and quantum gravity scales .",
    "therefore the minimal sm is expected to be just the low energy effective theory of an extended model in which new physics , that protects the mass of the higgs particles , appears at the tev - scale , e.g.  supersymmetry  ( susy ) , little higgs or extra dimensions .    instead of adding particles to the minimal sm in order to protect the naturalness of a light fundamental scalar , one can instead attempt to break the electroweak symmetry without invoking the condensation of fundamental scalar fields .",
    "indeed , such models were already proposed  @xcite a few years after the introduction of the sm . in this class of models a new strong interaction , called technicolor  ( tc ) , effects ewsb in analogy to chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , but at the tev scale .",
    "unfortunately , after extending  tc in order to produce fermion masses ( etc ) , the resulting models suffer from severe problems concerning flavor changing currents and electroweak precision observables . recently a deeper understanding , based on the celebrated ads / cft duality , of such higgsless models has emerged which is inspired by ewsb in extra dimensions , particularly in warped spacetimes such as a slice of ads5  @xcite . even though these approaches are nonrenormalizable and still suffer from some of the problems that plague etc , they remain perturbatively calculable up to energies of  @xmath1{tev}$ ]  @xcite while simultaneously improving the fits to electroweak precision observables  @xcite .    combining observations of galaxy clusters , type ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) from cobe and wmap , there is now overwhelming evidence that nonbaryonic cold dark matter  ( cdm ) constitutes roughly @xmath2 of the energy density of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this cdm should predominantly consist of stable nonrelativistic , electrically neutral colorless particles ( wimps ) . in light of this situation",
    ", it seems inevitable for any extension or alternative to the sm to eventually incorporate a phenomenologically acceptable cdm candidate .    in susy models and in models with flat extra dimensions ,",
    "there are natural candidates for cdm that are stabilized by @xmath0- and kk - parity  @xcite respectively .",
    "however , the warp factors and symmetry breaking boundary terms on the branes that are characteristic of higgsless models of ewsb break the translational invariance in the extra dimensions .",
    "therefore , the corresponding kk - parity is not a symmetry of higgsless models . as a result , none of the kaluza - klein  ( kk ) modes are protected against decay and they fail to provide a candidate for stable cdm . in the light of the above astrophysical observations , we are therefore compelled to extend the spectrum of higgsless models in a different way if we want to retain them as viable alternatives to the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) and its cousins .",
    "one approach , which has been proposed recently  @xcite , is to glue together two slices of ads5 and to use an exchange symmetry as a kk - parity , protecting a cdm candidate from decay .",
    "another approach  @xcite extends the spectrum and guarantees the stability of a cdm candidate by a  @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "while the naturalness of the tev - scale does not require the introduction of susy in higgsless models , susy can nevertheless be expected to play an important role in any more fundamental theory . in particular",
    ", string theory requires susy at some scale .",
    "indeed , string theory provided much of the inspiration for the revival of extra dimensional models , for higgsless models and for ads / cft .",
    "it is therefore natural to investigate supersymmetric extensions of higgsless models .",
    "if these extensions admit an @xmath0-parity , stable candidates for cdm are guaranteed to be part of the spectrum .",
    "indeed , we propose to extend the above - mentioned higgsless models in a slice of ads5 with susy , providing a stable particle as a viable cdm candidate .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the following framework : assume that the sector providing ewsb exhibits a global susy whereas the  @xmath4 gauge theory to which it is coupled does not .",
    "our approach extends the particle spectrum and its interactions in a well - defined way requiring a minimum of new assumptions .",
    "we examine possible scenarios which differ in how the fields on the uv brane are coupled to the bulk , calculate the relic density and show that the observed dark matter density @xmath5  @xcite can be achieved straightforwardly with reasonable gaugino masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:5dsusy ] we fix our notations , by giving a concise review of susy and the susy spectrum in a warped background . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we outline the supersymmetric version of the higgsless models on which our construction is based  @xcite . in section  [ sec : dmpheno ] we survey the parameter space of our proposed model , identifying the cdm candidate and estimating its relic density .",
    "we find that it is possible to obtain realistic relic densities of a neutralino lsp without much fine tuning .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "further technical details , regarding the interplay of susy , kk - decomposition and boundary conditions  ( bcs ) can be found in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "in this work we assume that the backreaction of the matter and gauge degrees of freedom  including superpartners and kk - towers  on the warped geometry can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we only need to implement the global susy transformations that are compatible with the isometries of the warped background geometry and not the full supergravity algebra .    in the case of flat extra dimensions , the susy algebra in minkowski space can be generalized straightforwardly to five dimensions by using the corresponding clifford algebra and promoting the parameters to four component spinors .",
    "the commutator of two transformations then still reads @xmath6       = -2(\\bar{\\eta}\\gamma^m\\xi-\\bar{\\xi}\\gamma^m\\eta)p_m\\,,\\ ] ] where the gamma matrices are now defined such that @xmath7 expressing the 5d  @xmath8=1-susy algebra in terms of four component generators , @xmath9 a comparison with the 4d  @xmath8=2-susy algebra reveals that @xmath10 plays the role of a central charge in the 4d picture  @xcite .",
    "since translations leave the metric  @xmath11 invariant , we are dealing with a global spacetime symmetry .    moving on to a warped background",
    ", we retain the approximation of neglecting the backreaction , as stated above . following the approach of  @xcite for the treatment of a curved background ,",
    "we define global susy transformations by demanding that they leave the metric  @xmath12 invariant . in other words",
    ", we demand that these global susy transformations close into a killing vector field  @xmath13 of the background metric . in particular @xmath14=v^n p_n\\ ] ] and the killing condition for  @xmath13 reads @xmath15 while the gamma matrices satisfy now @xmath16 this gives us a condition for the spinor valued parameters of the susy transformations , and solutions  @xmath17 of  ( [ eq : killing-1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : killing-2 ] ) are called killing spinors .",
    "we use a `` mostly  @xmath18 '' metric convention .",
    "the warped background metric we are dealing with in this work is that of randall - sundrum  ( rs ) type  i  @xcite , which , in proper distance coordinates , reads @xmath19 , and consequently  @xmath20 . here",

    "we work in the interval picture with bcs , noting that this space could also be interpreted as an orbifold .",
    "there are the usual 4d poincar symmetries and an additional scaling symmetry @xmath26 which is broken only by the presence of the branes .",
    "working out the killing condition  ( [ eq : killing-1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : killing-2 ] ) in this background , one ends up with a set of susy parameters which generate susy transformations that close into the remaining symmetries , namely , using 2-spinor notation , @xmath27 where the space - time dependence remains confined to the warp factor .",
    "this relation fixes the kk wavefunctions of the superpartners .",
    "since  ( [ eq : susypar ] ) is parameterized by a single weyl - spinor , there can be at most one 4d supersymmetry left after integrating out the extra dimension .",
    "nevertheless , we will see in the following sections , that the spectrum of the massive kk modes will formally be that of 4d @xmath8=2-susy",
    ".    counting the degrees of freedom reveals that a massless 5d vector boson can not be combined with 5d spinors to form a susy multiplet .",
    "the smallest multiplet that contains both is actually a dimensionally reduced 6d vector multiplet which consists of a 4d vector multiplet and a chiral multiplet  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the 5d hypermultiplet is constructed from a dirac spinor @xmath28 and two complex scalars as its superpartners .",
