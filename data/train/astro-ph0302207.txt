    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation was first detected by @xcite .",
    "after its discovery , a small number of experimentalists worked for years to better characterize the cmb as they searched for temperature fluctuations .",
    "a leader of this effort , and of the _ wmap _   effort , was our recently deceased colleague , professor david t. wilkinson of princeton university .",
    "he was also a leading member of the _ cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) _ mission team , which accurately characterized the spectrum of the cmb @xcite and first discovered anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the _ map _ was recently renamed _ wmap _   in his honor .    the general recognition that the cmb is a primary tool for determining the global properties , content , and history of the universe has led to the tremendous interest and growth of the field .",
    "in addition to the characterization of the large - scale anisotropy results from _ cobe _",
    "@xcite , a host of experiments have measured the finer scale anisotropy @xcite . as a result of these tremendous efforts ,",
    "the first acoustic peak of the anisotropy power spectrum has been unambiguously detected @xcite and cmb observations have placed important constraints on cosmological models .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the first detection of cmb polarization arising from the anisotropic scattering of cmb photons at decoupling , ushering in a new era of cmb polarization measurements .",
    "the _ wmap _  mission was designed to advance observational cosmology by making full sky cmb maps with accuracy , precision , and reliability , as described by @xcite .",
    "the instrument observes the temperature difference between two directions ( as did _ cobe _ ) using two nearly identical sets of optics @xcite .",
    "these optics focus radiation into horns @xcite that feed differential microwave radiometers @xcite .",
    "we produce full sky maps in five frequency bands from the radiometer data of temperature differences measured over the full sky .",
    "a cmb map is the most compact representation of cmb anisotropy without loss of information .    in this paper",
    "we present the maps , their properties , and a synopsis of the basic results of the first - year of observations . in  [ obs ] we give a brief overview of the _ wmap _  mission . in  [ calsys ] we summarize the data analysis , calibration , and systematic errors of the experiment , which are discussed in much greater detail in the companion papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in  [ maps ]",
    "we present the maps and their sampling properties , and we compare the _ wmap _  and _ cobe _ maps . in  [ galaxy ] we summarize the foreground analyses of @xcite . in  [ gauss ] we establish the gaussian nature of the _ wmap _  anisotropy , determined in the companion paper of @xcite . in  [ multipoles ] we present the dipole and quadrupole moments and summarize analyses of the angular power spectrum @xcite . in  [ reion ] we highlight the _ wmap _  polarization results , including a detection of the reionization of the universe @xcite . in  [ cosmo ] we summarize some of the cosmological implications of the _ wmap _   results @xcite . finally , in  [ data ]",
    "we discuss the availability of the _ wmap _  data products .",
    "the 840 kg _ wmap _  observatory was launched aboard a delta ii 7425 - 10 rocket ( delta launch number 286 ) on 30 june 2001 at 3:46:46.183 edt from cape canaveral .",
    "_ wmap _  executed three phasing loops in the earth - moon system before a lunar - gravity - assist swing - by , a month after launch , catapulted _ wmap _  to an orbit about the second lagrange point of the sun - earth system , l@xmath28 .",
    "station - keeping is performed approximately four times per year to maintain the observatory in a lissajous orbit about the l@xmath28 point with the earth-_wmap _  vector within about @xmath29 of the sun - earth vector .",
    "the phasing loop maneuvers and station - keeping are executed using the _ wmap _   propulsion system of blow - down hydrazine and eight thrusters .    the central design philosophy of the _ wmap _  mission was to minimize sources of systematic measurement errors @xcite .",
    "the _ cobe _ mission proved the effectiveness of a differential design in minimizing systematic errors .",
    "therefore , the _ wmap _  instrument was designed with a back - to - back optical system with 1.4 m @xmath30 1.6 m primary reflectors to provide for differential measurements of the sky .",
    "the primary and secondary reflectors direct radiation into two focal planes , with ten feed horns in each , as described by @xcite .",
    "the beams have a gain pattern , @xmath31 , which is neither symmetric nor gaussian .",
    "we define the beam solid angle as @xmath32 .",

    "there are ten `` differencing assemblies '' each consisting of two `` radiometers '' with two `` channels '' each @xcite .",
    "there are four w - band ( @xmath40 ghz ) , two v - band ( @xmath4161 ghz ) , two q - band ( @xmath41 41 ghz ) , one ka - band ( @xmath41 33 ghz ) , and one k - band ( @xmath41 23 ghz ) differencing assemblies .",
    "we usually refer to these bands by the generic designations k , ka , q , v , and w because there are multiple radiometers in each band , whose precise frequencies are not identical . also , the effective frequency of a radiometer depends on the spectrum of the emission it detects .",
    "precise frequencies for the radiometers for a cmb anisotropy spectrum are given by @xcite .",
    "polynomials are given to determine the effective frequency of the radiometers depending on the emission frequency spectrum .",
    "see table [ overview ] for a summary of radiometer properties .",
    "undesirable @xmath42 noise is minimized by the design of the _ wmap _  radiometers @xcite .",
    "all radiometers have @xmath42 knees below 50 mhz ; 18 of 20 are below 10 mhz ; and 10 of the 20 are below 1 mhz @xcite .",
    "( the @xmath42 knee is defined as the frequency where the noise power spectral density is @xmath43 times higher than its high frequency value . )",
    "@xcite demonstrate that all radiometer outputs have gaussian noise , which `` integrates down '' with time as expected .",
    "the radiometers are passively cooled to @xmath44 k with no mechanical refrigerators .",
    "in addition , no actively cycling heaters were permitted anywhere on the _ wmap _  spacecraft .",
    "these design features helped to ensure a mechanically , thermally , and electronically quiet platform that minimizes the driving forces of systematic measurement errors .",
    "in addition to the differential design , the _ cobe _ mission also demonstrated the importance of scanning large areas of the sky in a short period of time with a complex scan pattern .",
    "_ wmap _  follows the _ cobe _ example with a three - axis ( three reaction wheel ) control system that maintains the observatory in a nearly constant survey mode of operations .",
    "( the observatory is in constant survey mode , except for only @xmath45 hr for each of @xmath46 station - keeping maneuvers per year . ) in survey mode , the optical boresight sweeps out a complex pattern on the sky @xcite .",
    "approximately 30% of the sky is observed each hour .",
    "the observatory spins at 0.464 rpm ( @xmath417.57 mhz ) and precesses at 1 rev hr@xmath20 ( @xmath41 0.3 mhz ) .",
    "six months are required for l@xmath28 to orbit half way around the sun , allowing for full sky coverage .",
    "the observations presented in this and companion papers include a full orbit about the sun , thus containing two sets of full sky observations .",
    "by 10 august 2001 , _ wmap _  was sufficiently stable in its l@xmath28 orbit for cmb data - taking to commence .",
    "one year of observations , completed on 9 august 2002 , were analyzed .",
    "data taken beyond this date will be the subject of future analyses .",
    "time - ordered telemetry data from the observatory are down - linked via nasa s deep space network ( dsn ) to the _ wmap _  science and mission operations center ( smoc ) at the goddard space flight center .",
    "the data are then transferred to the _ wmap _  science team for analysis .",
    "all of the instrument data are down - linked to the ground without any on - board flight data processing , thus allowing full insight into potential systematic effects .",
    "only a fraction of a percent of data was lost in the flow from the observatory to the smoc .",
    "about 1% of the received data were not used due to systematic error concerns ( e.g. , data taken during near station - keeping maneuvers ) . of the @xmath47% good data ,",
    "the processing pipeline flagged observations where bright planets were in the beams so that these data would not used be used in making maps .",
    "the statistics on lost , bad , and flagged data are given in table [ baddata ] .",
    "an overview of the data flow is shown in figure [ dataflow ] .",
    "the heart of the data analysis efforts center on studies of systematic measurement errors @xcite .",
    "components of spurious signals at the spin period are the most difficult to distinguish from true sky signals .",
    "the observatory was designed to minimize all thermal and voltage variations and all susceptibilities to these variations , especially at the spin period , as discussed in  [ obs ] and by @xcite .",
    "in addition , high precision temperature monitors on the observatory provide the data needed to verify that systematic errors from thermal variations are negligible .",
    "@xcite report that in - flight spin - synchronous effects from the radiometers are @xmath48k rms in the time - ordered - data ( tod ) , based on flight thermal variations multiplied by upper limits on component susceptibilities measured in ground testing .",
    "analysis of flight data without use of characterizations derived from ground - based testing give @xmath49k rms from all sources ( not just the radiometers ) .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath50 times smaller than the requirement that was set in the mission s systematic error budget .",
    "thus , _ no corrections to the first year _ wmap _",
    "data are required for spin - synchronous systematic errors .",
    "_    the core of the processing pipeline calibrates the data and converts the differential temperatures into maps .",
    "the data are calibrated based on the earth - velocity modulation of the cmb dipole . a gain model of the radiometers",
    "was derived and fit by @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the constancy of the dipole signal on the sky , the measured physical temperature of the front - end radiometer components , and on the time - averaged rf - bias ( total power ) of the radiometer outputs .",
    "this relatively simple model closely matches the gains derived from the hourly measurements of the amplitude of the dipole and is used in _",
    "wmap _  data processing .",
    "calibration is achieved within 0.5% accuracy , dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the absolute calibration .",
    "low levels of @xmath42 noise create stripes in the maps that affect the angular power spectrum and other statistics derived from the maps .",
    "a pre - whitening filter is applied to the tod to minimize these artifacts .",
    "an estimate of the magnitude of the striping is given in @xcite for the maps , and by @xcite for the power spectrum .",
    "the differential temperature data are formed into maps based on the technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "healpix is used to define map pixels on the sky in galactic coordinates .",

    "the number of pixels in the map is @xmath53 .",
    "the area per pixel is @xmath54 and the separation between pixel centers is @xmath55 .",
    "for example , healpix resolution level @xmath56 ( used in _ wmap _  map - making ) corresponds with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 sr , and @xmath60 arc - min .",
    "_ wmap _  observes the sky convolved with the beam pattern .",
    "this is equivalent to the the spatial transform of the sky multiplied by the instrument s `` window function . ''",
    "the beam patterns are measured in - flight from observations of jupiter @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in our knowledge of the beam pattern , although small , are a significant source of uncertainty for _ wmap _  since they imply imperfect knowledge of the window function .",
    "a small difference between the a - side and b - side optical losses was derived based on dipole observations and corrected in the processing .",
    "far sidelobes of the beam patterns , determined by ground measurements and in - flight using the moon , have been carefully examined @xcite .",
    "a small far - sidelobe correction is applied only to the k - band map .",
    "we now describe the maps .",
    "we combine the radiometer results within each band and present the five full sky maps at effective cmb anisotropy frequencies 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz in figures [ k ] , [ ka ] , [ q ] , [ v ] , [ w ] .",
    "the maps are shown in the mollweide projection in units of cmb thermodynamic temperature .",

    "figure [ kka ] shows the k - band and ka - band maps , with the ka - band map smoothed to k - band resolution .",
    "note both the significant decrease in galactic signal from k - band to ka - band and the high galactic latitude similarities of the cmb between the maps .",
    "likewise , figure [ qvw ] shows the q - band , v - band , and w - band maps with the latter two smoothed to q - band resolution .",
    "higher galactic contamination in q - band is apparent .",
    "both figures [ kka ] and [ qvw ] highlight the consistency of the high galactic latitude cmb anisotropy pattern from band to band .    comparisons of data between _ wmap _  radiometers , and between _ wmap _  and _ cobe _ , are important indicators of systematic error levels . figure [ cobemapw ] illustrates the enormous improvement in angular resolution from _ cobe _ to _ wmap_. features in the maps appear to be generally consistent , but the consistency is better addressed by a more direct comparison . to do this we take a combination of the _ wmap _  q - band and v - band maps and smooth it to mimic a _",
    "cobe_-dmr 53 ghz map ( see figure [ qv53 ] ) .",
    "we then examine the difference between the _ cobe _ and _ wmap _   pseudo - map .",
    "figure [ cobemapqv ] shows the difference map along with a simulated map of the noise . with the exception of a feature in the galactic plane ,",
    "the agreement is clearly at the noise level .",
    "the galactic plane feature is likely to be a result of the spectral index uncertainty of combining the q - band and v - band maps to make a 53 ghz equivalent map .",
    "an understanding of diffuse galactic emission and extragalactic point sources is necessary for cmb analyses .",
    "the _ wmap _  mission carries radiometers at five frequencies for the purpose of separating the cmb anisotropy from foreground emission based on their different spectra .",
    "figure [ 3band ] illustrates the spectral difference between the cmb and foregrounds .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "bands were selected to be near the frequency where the ratio of the cmb anisotropy to the contaminating foreground is at a maximum .      for cmb analyses it is necessary to mask out regions of bright foreground emission .",
    "@xcite present a recipe for foreground masks based on k - band temperature levels .",
    "since foreground contamination is most severe in k - band , it is used as the best tracer of contamination .",
    "the contamination morphology is similar enough across all five _ wmap _  bands that masks based on the temperature levels in other bands would be redundant and unnecessary .",
    "standard names are given for the mask levels .",
    "for example , the kp0 mask cuts 21.4% of sky pixels while the kp2 mask cuts 13.1% .",
    "see @xcite for further detail . an extragalactic point source mask is also constructed based on selections from source catalogs .",
    "an additional 2% of pixels are masked due to these @xmath61 sources .      beyond the use of masks , one technique for reducing the level of foreground contamination",
    "is to form a linear combination of the multifrequency _ wmap _  data that retains unity response for only the emission component with a cmb spectrum .",
    "this technique was introduced for _ cobe _ by @xcite . with five _ wmap",
    "_  bands instead of the three on _ cobe _ , and with a somewhat more elaborate approach for _ wmap _ , @xcite arrive at the internal ( _ wmap _  data only ) linear combination map seen in figure [ ilc ] of this paper . the foregrounds are removed to a remarkable degree ; however , the statistics of this internal linear combination map are complex and inappropriate for most cmb analyses .",
    "below , we use the notation convention that flux density is @xmath62 and antenna temperature is @xmath63 , where the spectral indices are related by @xmath64 . in general , the cmb is expressed in terms of thermodynamic temperature , while galactic and extragalactic foregrounds are expressed in antenna temperature .",
    "thermodynamic temperature differences are given by @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the planck constant , @xmath35 is frequency , @xmath68 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath69 k is the cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath70 for the _ wmap _  bands are given by @xcite and can be found in table [ overview ] .",
    "@xcite identify the amplitudes and spectral indices of the individual emission components . a maximum entropy method ( mem )",
    "approach is adopted where priors are used for component amplitudes and spectral indices , except for free - free emission , which has a fixed spectral index ( @xmath71 in the _ wmap _  bands ) .",
    "an iterative fit is performed , where the pixel - by - pixel amplitudes are updated in accordance with the mem residuals until low ( @xmath72% ) residuals are achieved .",
    "the process results in a map of each emission component for each of the five _ wmap _  bands . the derived maps of thermal emission from dust give a uniform spectral index across the sky of @xmath73 .",
    "the derived map of free - free emission is reasonable given the amplitude and morphology of h@xmath17 measurements .",
    "the other radio component fit should include the combined emission of synchrotron and spinning dust .",
    "it shows the synchrotron spectrum steepening with increasing frequency , as would be expected for a spectral break due to synchrotron losses at @xmath74 ghz .",
    "there is no indication of the less steep or flattening spectral index that would result from spinning dust emission .",
    "the spinning dust emission is limited to @xmath75% of the total ka - band foreground .",
    "reports of dust - correlated microwave emission from _ cobe _ data analyses are understood as an admixture of the fraction of synchrotron emission ( with @xmath76 ) that is traced by a dust template , and thermal dust emission ( @xmath77 ) , giving a combined spectral index of @xmath78 between the _ wmap _  ka - band and v - band , approximating the _ cobe _ 31 ghz and 53 ghz bands .    while the mem method is useful for understanding the nature of the foreground emission components , these results can not be directly used in cmb analyses due to the complex noise properties that result from the mem process and its simultaneous use of multifrequency maps .",
    "this is because the multifrequency maps are smoothed , different weights are used in different regions of the sky and these weights are smoothed , all of which complicates the noise correlations . for the cmb analyses we use a mask to exclude pixels where the galactic emission is strong , combined with template fitting ( using external data only ) where the foregrounds can be adequately corrected",
    "this approach does not complicate the noise properties of the maps .",
    "the kp2 cut is used for all analyses except for limits on non - gaussianity and the temperature - polarization correlation function , where the more severe kp0 cut is used .",
    "@xcite describe the template fitting in detail .",
    "thermal dust emission has been mapped over the full sky in several infrared bands , most notably by the _",
    "cobe _ and _ iras _ missions .",
    "a full sky template is provided by @xcite , and is extrapolated in frequency by @xcite .",
    "the mostly synchrotron emission map of @xcite at 408 mhz is used as a radio template .",
    "the free - free ionized gas is traced by the h@xmath17 map assembled by @xcite from the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) , the virginia tech spectral - line survey ( vtss ) , and the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa ) @xcite .",
    "the haslam map resolution is not as high as that of the wmap maps , and the haslam map has artifacts from experimental effects such as striping from spatial calibration variations .",
    "the striping in the haslam map is along the survey scan lines and was corrected to first order by the application of a wiener filter .",
    "( the filtered version of the haslam map is publicly available on the lambda web site . )",
    "the remaining adverse effects of the haslam map are mitigated by two effects .",
    "first , the template fit calls only for a small haslam correlation ( see  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "since the correction is small , the error on the correction is negligible .",
    "second , the foreground contamination is most significant only on the largest angular scales so the haslam resolution limit and small - scale map artifacts are not significant sources of error .",
    "the mem solution only uses the haslam map as a prior and the spinning dust limit only uses the full sky median of the haslam map .",
    "thus the spinning dust limit is insensitive to residual striping in the haslam map .",
    "the mem results are used to assess the degree of foreground emission remaining after the template subtraction .",
    "the result is @xmath79k rms at q - band and @xmath80k rms at both v - band and at w - band for @xmath81 .",
    "this remaining foreground emission constitutes @xmath82% of the cmb variance ( up to @xmath83 ) in q - band , and @xmath841% of the cmb variance in v- and w - bands .",
    "figures 3 and 4 of @xcite demonstrate that this small residual foreground level has a negligible effect on the cosmological results .",

    "a catalog of 208 detected sources ( with 98% reliability ) is provided by @xcite .",
    "statistically , five sources are expected to be false detections .",
    "five of the 208 sources do not have low frequency radio counterparts ; these sources are likely to be the false detections .",
    "we include @xmath41700 sources in our mask , despite having only detected @xmath41200 sources at the @xmath85 level , because sources below this detection level still contribute an undesirable statistical contamination to the maps . even beyond masking the  700 sources",
    ", we still need to make a statistical correction to the power spectrum for residual source contamination @xcite .",
    "the derived source counts give a power spectrum level of @xmath86k@xmath87sr at q - band .",
    "this is consistent with the level found in the bispectrum analysis of the maps @xcite and the level found in fits to the map power spectra @xcite .",
    "we have confidence that the point source level is understood since it is independently derived using three different methods .",
    "hot gas in clusters of galaxies imparts energy to the cmb photons , causing a temperature decrement in the _ wmap _  bands ( the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) .",
    "the coma cluster is expected to have the most pronounced signature . for the highest resolution maps ,",
    "@xcite get @xmath88 mk in w - band and @xmath89 mk in v - band in the direction of coma .",
    "use of the xbacs catalog of x - ray clusters as a template results in @xmath90 . this verifies that the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is barely detectable in even a matched search of the _ wmap _  sky maps and",
    "therefore it is not a significant `` contaminant '' to the _ wmap _  data .",
    "maps of the sky are the most complete and compact representation of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "cosmological analyses are based on statistical properties of the maps with the power spectrum as one of the most commonly derived statistics .",
    "the power spectrum is a complete representation of the data only if the cmb anisotropy is gaussian . also , the most common cosmological models predict that the cmb anisotropy should be consistent with a gaussian random field ( at least at levels that are currently possible to measure ) . therefore , we test the gaussianity of the anisotropy , both to interpret the power spectrum ( and other statistical derivatives of the maps ) and to test cosmological paradigms .",
    "there is no single best test for gaussianity .",
    "specific tests can be more or less sensitive to different assumed forms of non - gaussianity .",

    "anisotropy is examined via contours at different temperature levels , and the number and areas of regions enclosed by these contours are computed .",
    "three minkowski functionals are the area represented by hot and cold spots , the contour length around these areas , and the difference between the number of these areas ( the `` genus '' ) .",
    "it is widely believed that the cmb anisotropy arises from gaussian linear fluctuations in the gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite suggest that non - gaussian anisotropy be considered in terms of the curvature perturbation .",
    "the simplest expression for the overall primordial gravitational curvature perturbation , @xmath91 , is a sum of a linear @xmath92 and weak nonlinear components : @xmath93 $ ] where @xmath94 is the linear gaussian portion of the curvature perturbation and @xmath95 is a nonlinear coupling constant .",
    "then , @xmath96 corresponds to the purely linear gaussian case .",
    "since the cmb bispectrum measures the phase correlations of the anisotropy , it can be used to solve for @xmath95 .",

    "the cmb anisotropy is thus demonstrated to follow gaussian statistics .",
