    "the instrumental background of a given @xmath0-ray instrument has a complicated and complex dependence on its specific radiation environment and the details of the instrument design .",
    "the radiation environment , i.e.  the ambient photon and particle radiation fields , their spectral and angular distributions , as well as their time histories , are a sensitive function of a mission s orbit relative to the earth and the geomagnetic field . the photons and particles that constitute the local radiation environment interact with detector and instrument and spacecraft structures through a wide variety of physical processes , producing secondary photons and particles , as well as radioactive nuclei , which , upon their ( delayed ) decay , give rise to further secondaries .",
    "these primary and secondary photons and particles can result in detector triggers that pass all logical and electronic criteria required for proper events due to photons from celestial sources ; these triggers constitute the instrumental background . in a given radiation environment ,",
    "the strength and spectrum of the instrumental background are strongly influenced by details of the instrument design such as the choice of detector material , the field - of - view , active and passive shielding , and the amount and distribution of active and passive material .    among the radiation fields that are potential sources of intrumental background in @xmath0-ray astronomy missions",
    "are cosmic rays ( galactic cosmic rays , solar energetic particles , and anomalous cosmic rays ) , geomagnetically trapped particles , earth albedo radiations , diffuse cosmic x and @xmath0  radiation , and locally produced secondary radiation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". an accurate description of the radiation environment clearly is of great importance for instrumental background estimates .",
    "table  [ rad_env_table ] provides a summary ( for quick reference ) of some salient features of the radiation background components described below .    * _ galactic cosmic rays _ :",
    "galactic cosmic rays primarily consist of protons ( about 85% by number ) , followed by @xmath2 particles ( @xmath3% ) , and electrons ( @xmath4% ) ; the remainder are heavier nuclei . for kinetic energies above about 10  gev / nucleon solar modulation",
    "is no longer effective and the differential energy spectrum of cosmic rays can be approximated by an @xmath5 power law .",
    "this particle radiation is a dominant source of instrumental background for missions that spend most of their time outside the earth s magnetosphere or at least above the radiation belts , but may be less significant for balloon borne experiments or missions in low - earth orbits ( leos ) because the geomagnetic field acts as a momentum / energy filter requiring that a charged particle must exceed a minimum rigidity of a particle of charge @xmath6 and momentum @xmath7 is given by : @xmath8 .",
    "a cut - off rigidity of 10  gv , which is a `` typical '' value for leos with low inclination , implies that a cosmic - ray proton must exceed a kinetic energy of about 9.1  gev to reach the spacecraft ] ( the so - called cut - off rigidity ) to reach a given location within the magnetosphere .",
    "for leos the incident cosmic radiation therefore varies with time because the local cut - off rigidity changes as the spacecraft follows its trajectory . outside the magnetosphere the only source of temporal variation in the incident cosmic radiation is solar modulation , which affects particles with kinetic energies less than a few gev / nucleon . at balloon altitudes and in leo the geomagnetic cutoff and earth shadowing result in a highly anisotropic cosmic - ray intensity ; outside the magnetosphere cosmic rays can be assumed isotropic . *",
    "_ solar energetic particles and anomalous cosmic rays _ : solar energetic particles ( seps ) are produced in violent energy releases on the sun such as flares or coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "they are reinforced on their way to earth by interplanetary particles accelerated by the shock waves from cmes . during these times",
    "their flux can be enormously high compared to other particle radiations .",
    "seps have energies up to several hundred mev / nucleon and hence a lower rigidity than galactic cosmic rays .",
    "missons in leos and balloon experiments are therefore shielded from most of them , while seps can be a dominant temporary source ( up to a few days ) of instrumental background for missions outside the magnetosphere . like seps ,",
    "anomalous cosmic rays are mainly a concern for missions outside the magnetosphere ; because they consist mostly of heavy nuclei they can be effective producers of secondaries in nuclear interactions .",
    "the intensity of anomalous cosmic rays is much more strongly effected by the solar cycle than that of galactic cosmic rays . *",
    "_ geomagnetically trapped radiation _ : out to a few earth radii , the geomagnetic field can be well approximated by a dipole .",
    "charged particles can be magnetically trapped in such a dipole field and stored in so - called radiation belts in the geomagnetic equatorial plane .",
    "the most abundant trapped particle species are protons and electrons . protons , which are of main concern for instrumental backgrounds , are trapped in a single belt , with the maximum proton intensity occuring at an altitude of @xmath9  earth radius .",
    "the energies of the protons extend up to several hundred mev ; their angular distribution can be highly anisotropic @xcite .",
    "the geomagnetic dipole is offset from the earth s center , therefore the proton belt appears to extend to lower altitudes over the coast of brazil  this area is usually referred to as the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) . because of its intensity this trapped proton radiation is avoided as much as possible by @xmath0-ray missions . however , the saa usually can not be avoided altogether for missions in leos . if encountered , passages through the saa are a dominant source for the production of radionuclides in the instrument and spacecraft materials @xcite .",
    "the saa dosage received by a mission in leo strongly depends on the orbit s altitude and inclination .",
    "* _ earth albedo radiation _ :",
    "when entering the earth s atmosphere galactic cosmic - ray particles interact violently with the air nuclei , initiating nuclear interaction cascades that ultimately result in the production of a multitude of secondaries of relatively low energy .",
    "the most important of these secondaries for @xmath0-ray experiments at balloon altitudes and in leo are photons and neutrons . at balloon altitudes ,",
    "the angular distribution of these secondaries is highly anisotropic , and their intensity depends on the local geomagnetic cut - off rigidity and on the depth in the atmosphere ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "depending on energy , both albedo photons and neutrons can constitute strong and anisotropic radiation fields for missions in leo , and are dominant background sources for balloon experiments .",
    "the relative importance of the earth s",
    "@xmath0-ray albedo as a diffuse photon source increases with energy , above about 35  mev it is 10100 times more intense than the diffuse cosmic @xmath0  radiation @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution of albedo neutrons extends from thermal energies to at least several hundred mev .",
    "the intensity of albedo @xmath0-rays @xcite and neutrons @xcite varies with the local geomagnetic rigidity and with the solar cycle . * _ diffuse cosmic x and @xmath0  radiation _ : the diffuse cosmic x and @xmath0radiation is of great astrophysical interest in its own right ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , it constitutes a background against which all other observations must be made . for the purpose of background simulations",
    ", the diffuse cosmic x and @xmath0radiation can be considered isotropic @xcite , and its energy spectrum constant in time and unaffected by the geomagnetic field . for missions in leo the shielding effect of the earth",
    "needs to be taken into account .",
    "in addition , at balloon altitudes there is direction - dependent attenuation by the atmosphere , although the atmospheric @xmath0  radiation usually dominates . * _ internally produced secondary particles _ : the photons and particles of the external radiation fields described above interact with the instrument and spacecraft structures through a wide variety of physical processes ( see below ) , producing a multitude of secondary particles such as photons , electrons and positrons , neutrons , protons and heavier nuclei . because this locally produced secondary radiation is produced by the external radiation fields it is therefore not a component of the radiation environment in the same sense as the external components .",
    "we list here the secondary radiation as a separate component of the radiation environment because it is treated as such in semi - empirical calculations of instrumental backgrounds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". in _ ab initio _",
    "monte carlo calculations , the topic of this paper , these secondary particles are derived from the modeling of the interactions of the external radiation fields , which are the only input .",
    "the photons and particles of the radiation environment interact through a wide variety of processes with the instrument and spacecraft structures and contribute to the instrumental background in different ways .",
    "backgrounds due to external photon fields are most important for instruments with poor spatial resolution and a large field - of - view .",
    "the photons trigger the detector either by entering through the field - of - view ( aperture flux ) or by entering through the veto shield without it being triggered ( shield leakage ) .",
    "energetic protons ( and heavier nuclei ) are a major source of instrumental background .",
    "they may pass through the instrument and spacecraft suffering only slight energy losses due to ionization in the traversed materials .",
    "however , they may also undergo a catastrophic nuclear interaction with a single nucleus , creating a potentially large number of secondary particles such as pions , nucleons , and light nuclei ; usually a relatively heavy product nucleus is left behind .",
    "the secondary particles may be energetic enough to initiate further nuclear interactions with other nuclei , their decay ( e.g.  pions ) can result in the generation of secondary photons , electrons , and positrons , and the de - excitation of residual nuclei gives rise to more secondary particles ( mainly photons ) .",
    "all of these processes and interactions occur on timescales that are short compared to typical timescales for event processing by the instrument electronics ( which typically are a few to about 100  @xmath10s ) and contribute to the so - called _ prompt _ instrumental background . depending on energy , veto shields",
    "can reduce prompt background components by a few orders of magnitude . some of the product nuclei resulting from interactions of protons or other hadrons may not be stable and emit further secondary particles when undergoing radioactive decay . depending on the lifetime of the unstable product nucleus",
    ", the time delay between its production and its decay may be much longer than typical instrumental event processing timescales , contributing to the so - called _ delayed _ instrumental background . for satellite missions",
    "the long - term build - up of delayed background due to long - lived isotopes ( e.g.  @xmath11na , @xmath12  y ) is very clearly visible @xcite .",
    "the best strategy to minimize delayed instrumental background is to minimize the amount of passive material in the instrument , particularly in the vicinity of the detectors .",
    "more positively , the time - scale of the long - term build - up is characteristic of the nuclear half - life , and a valuable key to identification of the nucleus involved .",
    "neutrons are another major source of both prompt and delayed instrumental background components . unlike protons",
    ", neutrons can traverse veto shielding without triggering it and produce prompt background _ within _ the detector through elastic and inelastic scattering ( by passing energy to the recoil nucleus and de - excitation ) as well as neutron capture ( de - excitation of the product nucleus ) .",
    "outside the veto shield the de - excitation of product nuclei from neutron induced nuclear interactions , including neutron capture , also contribute to the prompt background .",
    "some of these product nuclei are unstable , and their radioactive decay adds to the delayed background .    an important aspect of the instrumental background is the presence of many lines .",
    "the position , strength , and shape of instrumental lines are relevent because they can interfere with spectroscopy of astrophysical @xmath0-ray lines .",
    "instrumental lines can result from prompt processes such as de - excitation of excited nuclei as well as from delayed radioactive decays .",
    "instrumental lines can also be used as powerful diagnostics of the overall instrumental background , including continuum components .",
    "for example , @xmath0-ray lines produced by isomeric transitions in ge detectors can be used to estimate the neutron flux inside the veto shield , which then in turn allows an estimate of continuum backgrounds due to elastic and inelastic neutron scattering and neutron induced @xmath13-decays ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mggpod suite is a user - friendly monte carlo simulation package that is applicable to all stages of space - based @xmath0-ray astronomy missions . in particular",
    ", the mggpod suite allows _ ab initio _ simulations of instrumental backgrounds  including the many @xmath0-ray lines  arising from interactions of the various radiation fields within the instrument and spacecraft materials .",
    "it is possible to simulate both prompt instrumental backgrounds , such as energy losses of cosmic - ray particles and their secondaries , as well as delayed instrumental backgrounds , which are due to the decay of radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear interactions .",
    "mggpod can also be used to study the response of @xmath0-ray instruments to astrophysical and calibration sources .",
    "the mggpod suite is therefore an ideal monte carlo tool for supporting most stages of @xmath0-ray missions , ranging from instrument design to data reduction .",
    "software and documentation are available to the public for download at the centre detude spatiale des rayonnements . in this publication",
    "we focus on the physics simulated by the mggpod suite .",
    "detailed practical advice for users on how to install and use this monte carlo package , including examples , can be found in the documentation available on the mggpod web site ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "mggpod is a suite of five closely integrated monte carlo packages , namely * mg*eant , * g*calor , * p*rompt , * o*rihet , and * d*ecay , each of which will be described in more detail below .",
    "the mggpod package resulted from a combination of the nasa / gsfc mgeant @xcite and the university of southampton s ggod @xcite monte carlo codes",
    ". both were improved , and supplemented by the newly developed prompt package .",
    "the overall structure of the mggpod package is illustrated in fig .",

    "are needed to obtain the resulting energy deposits in the detector system under study , as summarized in table  [ mggpod_sim_steps ] .",
    "in general , it is advisable to simulate each component of the radiation environment separately .",
    "mggpod distinguishes two classes of radiation fields .",
    "class  i comprises radiation fields for which only prompt energy deposits are of interest , such as celestial or laboratory @xmath0-ray sources or cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "class  ii comprises radiation fields for which additional delayed energy deposits resulting from the activation of radioactive isotopes need to be considered",
    ". examples of class  ii fields are cosmic - ray protons , or geomagnetically trapped protons .    for both of these classes ,",
    "the simulation of the prompt energy deposits requires two input files : a mass model , and a model of the simulated radiation field .",
    "the mass model is a detailed computer description of the experimental set - up under study .",
    "it specifies the geometrical structure of instrument and spacecraft , the atomic and/or isotopic composition of materials , and sets parameters that influence the transport of particles in different materials .",
    "each component of the radiation environment ( and analogously for @xmath0-ray sources ) to which the instrument is exposed is characterized by three quantities : the type of the incident particles , and their spectral and angular distributions .",
    "the prompt energy deposits are written to an output event file . in case of a class  ii radiation field",
    "there is an additional output file which lists , for all nuclei produced in hadronic interactions , the product nucleus identity along with the geometrical mass model element in which it was produced . from this file isotope production rates can be computed .",
    "to simulate delayed energy deposits ( class  ii radiation field ) two additonal steps need to be taken .",
    "these require as input the time history of the radiation field which is responsible for the activation , and the previously calculated isotope production rates . based on this information first the activity of each isotope produced in each structural element of the mass model is determined by orihet .",
    "then , employing the mgeant , gcalor , and decay packages , these activities are used to simulate the delayed energy deposits due to radioactive decays in the instrument .    combining prompt and delayed energy deposits from each component of the radiation environment and @xmath0-ray sources",
    ", it is possible to obtain the total energy deposited in the system as a function of position and time . in the following ,",
    "each of the five packages that constitute the mggpod simulation suite is described .",
    "mgeant is a multi - purpose simulation package developed by the low energy gamma ray group ( legr ) at nasa / gsfc @xcite .",
    "it is based on the geant detector description and simulation tool ( version 3.21 ) created and supported by the application software group , computing networks division , at cern geneva , switzerland @xcite .",
    "geant3 is designed to simulate the passage of elementary particles through an experimental set - up , which may be of considerable complexity .",
    "although originally designed for high - energy physics experiments , geant3 has found applications in many other areas , including space science and specifically @xmath0-ray astronomy . within the mggpod suite ,",
    "mgeant ( i.e.  geant3 ) stores and transports all particles , and treats electromagnetic interactions from about 10  kev to a few tev .",
    "in addition , mgeant provides the option to use the geant low - energy compton scattering package glecs , which provides more detailed physical models of the coherent ( rayleigh ) and incoherent ( compton ) photon scattering processes than those included in the standard geant3 distribution by taking into account the kinetic energy of the bound electrons @xcite .",
    "mgeant was created to increase the versatility and user - friendliness of the geant3 simulation tool . a modular , `` object oriented '' approach was pursued , giving mgeant two main advantages over standard geant3 .",
    "first , the instrument specific geometries and materials are provided via input files , rather than being hard - coded .",
    "second , several event - generation beam models and spectral models are available ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "beam models include a plane wave , an isotropic radiation field , astrophysical and calibration point sources , or a user defined sky map ; spectral models include power law and exponential spectra , line emission , or user defined spectra .",
    "furthermore , mgeant can interactively display ( using cern s paw++ package ) the geometric set - up as well as the particle trajectories  a very convenient capability when creating a mass model or defining and verifying beam parameters .",
    "in mggpod the only supported output file format is fits , for which two different event list formats are available : 1 ) standard format where the total energy deposit in each detector ( and in the anti - coincidence system ) for each event is listed , and 2 ) extended format where the energy deposits and location of each interaction , the time of interaction , and the type of the interacting particle are also listed .",
    "the extended format was introduced to facilitate detailed instrument response studies , such as the pulse - shape discrimination ( psd ) system of the _ integral _ spectrometer spi , or event reconstruction algorithms for advanced compton telescope concepts .",
    "mgeant is therefore very well suited for rapid prototyping of detector systems , it can readily generate most of the radiation fields relevant to @xmath0-ray astronomy , and it is set up to support detailed instrument response studies .",
    "the mgeant simulation package and a user manual are available at the nasa / gsfc web site of the legr group .",
    "gcalor @xcite is an interface between the calor89 package by @xcite and the geant3 simulation tool .",
    "the calor89 package , designed to simulate calorimeter systems for high - energy physics detectors , simulates hadronic interactions down to 1  mev for nucleons and charged pions and down to thermal energies ( @xmath14  ev ) for neutrons .",
    "gcalor incorporates the capability to perform hadronic interaction calculations in the geant3 framework by extracting the hetc ( high energy transport code ) collision and evaporation model and the fluka model ( which is already available in recent versions of geant3 ) from calor89 .",
    "the hetc monte carlo code consists of two parts : the nucleon meson transport code ( nmtc ) and the scaling model ( which provides a smooth transition between the nmtc and fluka regimes ) . for low energy neutrons the micap ( monte carlo ionization chamber analysis package ) neutron code by @xcite has been included into gcalor , rather than the morse neutron transport code utilized in calor89 .",
    "the particle types and energy ranges covered by the four modules of gcalor are :    * * nmtc * : nucleons 1  mev to 3.5  gev , charged pions 1  mev to 2.5  gev * * scaling model * : nucleons and charged pions 3  gev to 10  gev * * fluka * : nucleons and charged pions above 10  gev , and for all energies for particle types not implemented in calor * * micap * : neutrons @xmath14  ev to 20  mev    hadronic interactions between particles that are both heavier than individual nucleons , such as deuterium or helium nuclei , can not be simulated with gcalor",
    ". however , continuous energy losses , for example due to ionization of the matter traversed , are taken into account for all charged particles .",
    "the gcalor package is publicly available at the universitt mainz .    when combining gcalor with geant3 ( or mgeant ) ,",
    "all particles are stored and transported by geant3 .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are simulated by geant3 , hadronic interactions are simulated by gcalor .",
    "the geant3 plus gcalor package therefore extends the capabilities of the standard geant3 tool to include hadronic interactions of charged particles down to 1  mev and of neutrons down to thermal energies .",
    "equally important , this package provides access to the energy deposits from all interactions as well as to isotope production anywhere in the geometrical set - up .",
    "originally , gcalor / micap utilized only endf / b ( evaluated nuclear data files version b ) neutron data .",
    "unfortunately , these data , available e.g.  at the national nuclear data center ( nndc ) at brookhaven national laboratory , do not cover all elements or isotopes . in particular , individual neutron cross - sections for the five natural ge isotopes are missing .",
    "these cross - sections , which are clearly of great importance for simulations of instrumental backgrounds in ge spectrometers , were generated based on jendl ( japanese evaluated nuclear data library ) data by zeitnitz ( 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "some of the low - mass residual nuclei produced in spallations as modelled by gcalor are very neutron rich , particularly if the incident projectile is energetic ( e.g.  a primary cosmic - ray proton ) .",
    "most of these neutron - rich nuclei result from a failure of the intranuclear cascade / evaporation model used in gcalor ( gabriel 2004 , priv.comm . ) . some neutron rich nuclei have been identified in nuclear experiments and found to have short lifetimes of less than 1  s. neutron rich nuclei are unstable against the emission of one or several neutrons , a process that affects the number and energy distribution of secondary neutrons . to include this source of secondary neutrons into our simulations , mggpod checks whether light product nuclei ( @xmath15 ) are unstable against neutron emission , exploiting existing data whenever available @xcite , and mandates neutron emission if appropriate , converting the unstable original product nucleus into the highest - mass isotope that has no neutron exit channel .",
    "the prompt package was created for simulating the prompt de - excitation of excited nuclei produced by neutron capture , inelastic neutron scattering , and spallation ) , for the purpose of mggpod it is defined to comprise all hadronic interactions other than neutron capture which result in a product nucleus that is different from the target nucleus .",
    "we will , however , assume the validity of the evaporation model for all such interactions in our treatment ] .",
    "the prompt package consists of a data base containing information on the de - excitation of a large number of nuclei , and of code to access these data and to generate random samples of de - excitation particles ( photons and electrons ) .",
    "when simulating prompt hadron - induced backgrounds with mggpod , the mgeant , gcalor , and prompt packages are linked into a single executable ( see fig .  [ mggpod_flow_chart ] ) . each time",
    "a secondary nucleus is produced in a nuclear interaction as simulated by gcalor , prompt is called to model the de - excitation cascade . in gcalor ,",
    "prompt photons are generated for a few hadronic interactions , however , in general these photons are `` statistical '' and continuous ",
    "they do not reflect the actual discrete nuclear levels and the well - known selection rules for transitions between them .",
    "this approximate treatment proved sufficient for modeling calorimeters for high - energy physics detectors @xcite , but is clearly insufficient for detailed modeling of instrumental @xmath0-ray backgrounds .",
    "therefore any prompt photons generated by gcalor are replaced with those returned by the prompt package . with the exception of a few selected neutron rich nuclei ( see previous  ) , prompt treats all secondary nuclei as stable , irrespective of their lifetime ; all radioactive decays are treated in a subsequent simulation step using the decay package ( see fig .",
    "[ mggpod_flow_chart ] and table  [ mggpod_sim_steps ] ) .",
    "a de - excitation cascade may proceed through one or more isomeric levels ; if so , their effect on the time sequence of de - excitation particle emission is taken into account approximately , as described in ",
    "[ decay ] .",
    "we developed the prompt package in the spirit of the compound nucleus model , in which it is assumed that the reaction process can be separated into independent incoming and outgoing channels with a well - defined intermediate compound state .",
    "we rely on the gcalor package for a complete specification of the incoming channel in the three classes of prompt reaction , i.e.  neutron capture , inelastic neutron scattering , and spallation . beyond a determination of the daughter nucleus",

    "the resolution of tgrs at 500  kev was nominally about 3  kev full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , which was achieved in the early months of the mission @xcite ; thereafter resolution degraded due to accumulated damage from cosmic - ray impacts @xcite .",
    "the line profiles also became distorted , with marked tails on the low - energy wings , and energy calibration became more difficult due to gain shifts .",
    "we limit our analysis to the period jan.may , 1995 , when these problems were negligible , except for small low - energy tails particularly on the highest energy lines ( see   [ tgrs_line - ids ] ) .",
    "the tgrs background spectra were binned in 1  kev energy channels over the entire 20  kev  8  mev range .",

    "the required mass model has to give a faithful representation of the geometrical structure and its atomic / isotopic compositon , particularly for the ge detector and its vicinity . with increasing distance from the detector the details of the mass distribution are less critical ; however , we were careful to conserve the total mass of the spacecraft components and to represent their atomic / isotopic composition , as these are important factors for the generation of secondary particles and residual nuclei in hadronic interactions .",

    "the tgrs spectra were analyzed using the gaspan gamma spectrum analysis program .",
    "gaspan allowed us to characterize the shape of the instrumental lines as a function of energy , following parametrizations given by @xcite .",
    "the photopeak component of each line was described by a gaussian and a low - energy `` wing '' , whose importance increased with energy .",
    "the wing was modeled by the sum of two exponential tails representing effects from multiple compton scatterings and incomplete charge collection .",
    "the line width and tail parameters were determined as a function of energy using the strongest and cleanest lines .",
    "this energy dependent line shape was then employed to analyse tgrs spectra , particularly to resolve the many closely spaced or blended lines . when analyzing intrinsically broad lines arising from the prompt de - excitation of very short - lived levels ( @xmath16  ps , * ? ? ?",

    "most of the strong lines had already been identified with nuclear transitions in previous work with ge spectrometers @xcite , with which our results are in general agreement . however , the level of detail with which our simulation was performed allowed us to suggest that in many cases multiple transitions can be identified contributing to previously unidentified blends .",
    "thus in tables  [ class1_ids ] and [ class2_ids ] two or more transitions are frequently assigned to an observed line feature .",

    "if no certain identification could be made they were put in table  [ class2_ids ] , whose purpose is to draw attention to gaps in our knowledge of nuclear physics to encourage further work .",
    "lines which were visibly broader than the tgrs energy resolution were treated as blends , keeping in mind that an intrinsically broad component might also contribute . if multiple identifications were possible , sufficient ( in theory ) to explain the line width ,",
    "the line was included in table  [ class1_ids ] .",
    "two indications were used to assign a blend to the `` uncertain identity '' category ( table  [ class2_ids ] ) .",
    "first , a blend which was obviously broad enough to contain multiple lines might correspond to only one line in the simulation ( or none ) .",
    "second , a comparison of the observed and predicted line strengths might show the simulation seriously failing to reproduce an observed line .",
    "although there is considerable scatter in the reliability of the simulations even for well - identified narrow lines ( see below ) , we somewhat arbitrarily assigned blends where the ratio of simulated to observed line strength fell below 25% to table  [ class2_ids ] .    there are some obvious deficiencies in this qualitative procedure by which tables  [ class1_ids ] and [ class2_ids ] were compiled",
    ". there are considerable quantitative uncertainties in the simulations , as we shall see , preventing the ranking of transitions and the 10% cutoff from being totally reliable .",
    "the simulation may even omit lines altogether .",
    "such cases belong in table  [ class2_ids ] , but may appear in table  [ class1_ids ] if the line appears narrow or if @xmath75% of its observed strength is predicted by the simulations .",
    "several cases of this kind may be indicated by measurements of the line energy in table  [ class1_ids ] which are inconsistent with the transition energies .",
    "however , these cases may also be due to problems inherent in the use of the rather complicated function @xcite for fitting the line profiles .",

    "nevertheless , there is sufficient resemblance between the simulated and observed recoil features for comparisons to be made  lower and higher energy bounds and lines can be consistently identified , hence simulation and observation can be treated consistently .",
    "our method involved simply identifying the lower and upper energy bounds of the recoil features , summing the counts between these limits , and subtracting the estimated counts contributed by the lines and the continuum .",
    "the uncertainties in the values in table  [ inelast_recoil_table ] are overwhelmingly dominated by the uncertainties in the true values of line and continuum count rates .",
    "we quote ranges of count rate in each recoil feature corresponding to the most extreme estimates of the line and continuum strengths .",
    "the extreme low continuum estimate assumes a flat continuum having the flux corresponding to the upper energy bound ; the high continuum estimate is a linear interpolation between the lower and higher energy bounds .",
    "the line measurements within the recoil feature energy ranges ( table  [ class1_ids ] ) were assumed to be upper limits because of the possibility of contamination by the recoil feature .",
    "of course , upper line and continuum limits correspond to lower limits on the strength of the recoil feature in table  [ inelast_recoil_table ] , and _ vice versa_.    in table  [ inelast_recoil_table ] , note that the upper and lower energy bounds are somewhat arbitrarily chosen from one feature to the next , due to the interference of strong lines and other recoil features .",
    "thus the results should not be compared from one feature to the next  the important point is that theory and observation can be compared within the same feature , since they are treated consistently .",
    "we are left with the conclusion , based on the figures in table  [ inelast_recoil_table ] ( where comparable ) that the simulation and the measurement in general agree within 30%  an exception is the one above 834  kev , which suffers exceptionally strong interference from the lines at 844 and 847  kev ( see fig .

    "[ compare_tgrs_sim_spc_ratio ] .",
    "there is a weak tendency for the theory to over - predict the strength of the recoil features .",
    "this might result from systematic errors in any of the various quantities that are relevant for the simulation of the recoil features , such as the flux of secondary neutrons  which depends e.g.  on the accuracy of the mass model and of hadronic cross - sections in general , and the ge neutron cross - sections in particular .",
    "delayed radioactive decays in the tgrs instrument and the _ wind _ spacecraft also give rise to continuum background ( @xmath0-ray lines from radioactive decays are discussed below ) .",

    "_ wind _ , continuum background due to radioactive decays in the spacecraft is relatively less important because @xmath79 , with @xmath59 being a mass element and @xmath80 the distance from the detector , is lower for the spacecraft structure than for instrument parts .",
    "the delayed background exceeds the diffuse cosmic photon background above about 400  kev , and cuts off at about 4  mev .",
    "the simulation is also very successful in modeling the more than 200 lines that are observed in the tgrs spectrum .",
    "most ( about 87% ) of the lines are reproduced , with the ratio of simulated and actual line count rates clustering around a value of 1 with no trend in energy .",

    "we have described the capabilites , functioning , and structure of the mggpod monte carlo simulation suite , which is based on the widely used geant detector description and simulation tool ( version  3.21 , * ? ? ?",
    "mggpod is a user - friendly simulation package that is applicable to all stages of space - based @xmath0-ray astronomy missions . in particular",
    ", the mggpod package allows _ ab initio _ simulations of instrumental backgrounds , both continuum and @xmath0-ray lines , that arise from interactions of the various radiation fields within the instrument and spacecraft materials .",
    "it is possible to simulate both prompt instrumental backgrounds , such as energy losses of cosmic - ray particles and their secondaries , as well as delayed instrumental backgrounds , which are due to the decay of radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear interactions .",
    "the mggpod package and documentation are available to the public for download at the centre detude spatiale des rayonnements ( http://sigma-2.cesr.fr/spi/mggpod/ ) .    to demonstrate its capabilities , we employed the mggpod suite for modeling high resolution @xmath0-ray spectra recorded by the transient gamma - ray spectrometer ( tgrs ) on board _ wind _ during 1995 .",
    "we found that both the continuum and the @xmath0-ray line background are very well reproduced . regarding the continuum background ,",
    "the ratio between simulation and flight data is about 0.85 , except for the lowest energies below about 200  kev , where the ratio increases with decreasing energy up to a value of 1.2 .",
    "the simulation even reproduces well asymmetric , `` sawtooth '' or triangular - shaped broad spectral features that are due to inelastic neutron scattering off ge nuclei in the detector . regarding background lines",
    ", the simulation reproduces about 87% of the observed background lines in tgrs , with the ratio of simulated and actual line count rates clustering around a value of 1 with no trend in energy .",
    "our results for continuum and lines are as good as or better than those obtained by @xcite for osse , by @xcite for _ mars observer _ , or @xcite for _ heao-3 _ using other monte carlo tools .",
    "below about 200  kev , diffuse cosmic photons are found to be the dominant source of instrumental background in tgrs .",
    "the simulation overestimates this component , with the largest deviation of 20% occurring at the lowest energies .",
    "we attribute the overestimate mainly to uncertainties in the mass distribution around the ge detectors .",
    "although we made a substantial effort to describe the detector as accurately as possible in our mass model , we may have missed material in and close to the detector ( as described in   [ tgrs_sim ] ) .",
    "small changes in the amount and distribution of mass close to the detector have a large effect on the simulated count rate at a few tens of kev because of the strong photoelectric absorption at these energies , and also affect the probability of compton scattering of higher - energy photons into the detector .",
    "as mentioned in ",
    "[ tgrs_sim ] , we employed in our simulations an analytical model of @xcite for the spectrum of the diffuse cosmic photons , which was obtained by fitting results from various instruments .",
    "the uncertainty of this model is expected to be smaller than our overestimate of the background due to diffuse cosmic photons ; hence the model is unlikely to be the sole cause of it .",
    "the shortfall of the simulation above 200  kev is expected . currently , gcalor is not capable of simulating hadronic interactions of @xmath2 particles , hence the contributions of cosmic - ray @xmath2 particles to the prompt and the delayed background could not be modeled",
    ". a rough estimate of this contribution can be obtained with an empirical formula for the ratio of the total @xmath2 to proton cross - sections by @xcite .",
    "this ratio does not vary much with the mass of the target nucleus between al and ge , and has an average value of about 1.7 . by number ,",
    "the ratio of cosmic - ray @xmath2s to protons is about 0.14 ; hence we can estimate that if cosmic - ray @xmath2 particles could be included in the simulation , they would increase the prompt and delayed background by roughly 24%  enough to account for the current short - fall of about 15% .",
    "the effect of @xmath2 induced spallations on the activation of specific isotope species is very difficult to estimate , since the ratio of @xmath2 to proton cross - sections for specific spallation products strongly varies with energy @xcite . similarly , when modeling data from the osse instrument on board _ cgro _ , @xcite concluded that @xmath2 particles account for about 20% of the calculated activation due to cosmic rays .",
    "in addition , there are deficiencies in the mass model , since the total mass accounted for in the instrument and the spacecraft falls short of the documented mass budget by about 14% (   [ tgrs_sim ] ) . less mass will result in fewer interactions and hence less prompt background as well as less activation and therefore less delayed background .",
    "except for the lowest energies , shielding of the detector from @xmath0-rays originating in different parts of the detector and spacecraft is not expected to be significantly affected by the moderate mass deficit .",
    "the simulation reproduces about 87% of the observed background lines in tgrs , with the ratio of simulated to measured line count rates clustering around a value of 1 with no trend in energy . on average , lines from radioactive decays",
    "are well reproduced .",
    "we see a small trend of overproduction for lines from de - excitation of spallation products with decreasing mass .",
    "this trend is expected given the simple statistical method that is used for generating de - excitation photons .",
    "the simulation of lines from de - excitations involving isomeric levels is influenced by the choice for the detector time constant (   [ tgrs_description ] ) . in our simulations , we set this parameter to @xmath84s ; hence the results for lines from the isomeric levels of @xmath85ge ( the 13.3  kev level has a lifetime of @xmath86s ) are particularly sensitive to this parameter . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ compare_tgrs_sim_spc ] , [ compare_tgrs_sim_spc_40 - 800 ] , and [ compare_tgrs_sim_spc_ratio ] , both lines at 53.4  kev and 66.7  kev are overestimated , with the sum peak being relatively too strong . in the simulation ,",
    "partial summation of energy deposits by the electronics , which fills the interpeak region , is not modeled , thereby overestimating the sum peak .",
    "however , to reproduce the shape of the @xmath69ge complex better in the simulation , the parameter @xmath50 needs to be set to a value smaller than @xmath67s .",
    "there are a few lines which allow us to assess the overall quality of the simulation .",
    "the 511  kev line , which results from a multitude of processes ( e.g.  decay of @xmath87 produced in hadronic interactions , electromagnetic showers , radioactive decays ) is reproduced within a factor of 0.74 , indicating that there are no severe problems with modeling the diverse physics involved .",
    "the 2.223  mev line from thermal neutron capture on h , the features from inelastic neutron scattering off ge , and the doppler broadened line at 2.211  mev line from inelastic neutron scattering on @xmath88al are reproduced within factors of 1.4 , @xmath89 , and 1.1 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that flux and energy spectrum of secondary neutrons throughout tgrs and _ wind _ are fairly well reproduced , which in turn implies that there are no severe problems with the treatment of neutron production , propagation , and interaction .",
    "the remarkable performance of mggpod in modeling tgrs data encouraged us and others to employ this monte carlo suite to other instruments .",
    "preliminary results for the spectrometer spi on board _ integral _ have been reported by @xcite .",
    "mggpod reproduces well early - mission spi data ; however , remaining discrepancies imply that in the case of this much heavier and complex mission ( compared to tgrs ) there are deficiencies in the production and/or thermalization and capture of secondary neutrons .",
    "this has lead us to an ongoing systematic evaluation of the neutron cross - sections in gcalor , whose results will be presented in a future publication of a re - visited spi background simulation .",
    "recently , mggpod has also been applied to _ rhessi _ by @xcite .",
    "these preliminary results are encouraging , the overall spectrum is well reproduced . as expected for a mission in low - earth orbit ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the background is dominated by decays of radioactive isotopes produced during saa passages .",
    "however , both saa induced continuum and line components are overproduced , indicating the need for refining the modeling of the time - dependent activation during saa passages .",
    "two of us ( g.  w.  and m.  j.  h. ) will use mggpod to estimate instrumental background and sensitivity of the space based gamma - ray lens max @xcite .",
    "the performance and user - friendliness of mggpod also attracted the various instrument teams studying concepts for an advanced compton telescope ; they selected mggpod as their baseline simulation tool for predicting the performance and sensitivity of the various designs . to address better",
    "the requirements for studying the performance of these complex instruments , version 1.1 of mggpod , which is currently under development , will provide additional beam geometry and spectral options , will include the capability of modeling polarized photons , and will support additional output formats suitable for the advanced event reconstruction algorithms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
