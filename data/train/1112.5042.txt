    "wave maps , also known as nonlinear @xmath6-models , are a well - studied area in physics and mathematics .",
    "they constitute a class of nonlinear wave equations defined as critical points ( at least formally ) of lagrangians @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a smooth map into a riemannian manifold @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 is embedded , then critical points are characterized by the property that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dalembertian . in particular , harmonic maps from @xmath13",
    "are wave maps which do not depend on time .",
    "for a recent review of some of the main developments in the area we refer to krieger s survey  @xcite .    in the presence of symmetries , such as when the target manifold  @xmath14 is rotationally symmetric , one often singles out a special class of such maps called equivariant wave maps .",
    "for example , for the sphere @xmath15 one requires that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a positive integer and @xmath18 acts on both @xmath19 and @xmath20 by rotation , in the latter case about a fixed axis .",
    "these maps themselves have been extensively studied , see for example shatah  @xcite , christodoulou , tahvildar - zadeh  @xcite , shatah , tahvildar - zadeh  @xcite . for a summary of these developments , see the book shatah , struwe  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate equivariant wave maps from @xmath21-dimensional minkowski space exterior to a ball and with @xmath5 as target . to be specific , let @xmath22 be the unit ball in  @xmath23 .",
    "we then consider wave maps @xmath24 with a dirichlet condition on @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a fixed point on @xmath5 . in the usual equivariant formulation of this equation , where @xmath28 is the azimuth angle measured from the north pole , the equation for the @xmath17-equivariant wave map from @xmath29 reduces to @xmath30 we restrict to @xmath31 and @xmath32 with dirichlet boundary condition @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , we are considering the cauchy problem @xmath35 the conserved energy is @xmath36 any @xmath37 of finite energy and continuous dependence on @xmath38 must satisfy @xmath39 for all @xmath40 where @xmath41 is fixed . the natural space to place the solution into for @xmath42",
    "is the _ energy space _",
    "@xmath43 with norm @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the completion of the smooth functions on @xmath46 with compact support under the first norm on the right - hand side of  .",
    "the exterior equation was proposed by bizon , chmaj , and maliborski  @xcite as a model in which to study the problem of relaxation to the ground states given by the various equivariant harmonic maps . in the physics literature , this model was introduced in  @xcite as an easier alternative to the skyrmion equation .",
    "moreover , @xcite stresses the analogy with the damped pendulum which plays an important role in our analysis .",
    "numerical simulations described in  @xcite indicate that in each equivariance class and topological class given by the boundary value  @xmath47 at @xmath48 _ every solution _ scatters to the unique harmonic map that lies in this class . in this paper",
    "we verify this conjecture for @xmath49 .",
    "these solutions start at the north - pole and eventually return there . for @xmath50 we only obtain a perturbative result .    [ main ] consider the topological class defined by equivariance @xmath31 and degree @xmath42 .",
    "then for any smooth energy data in that class there exists a unique global and smooth evolution to   which scatters to zero in the sense that the energy of the wave map on an arbitrary but fixed compact region vanishes as @xmath51 .",
    "the scattering property can also be phrased in the following fashion : one has @xmath52 where @xmath53 solves the linearized version of  , i.e. , @xmath54 we prove theorem  [ main ] by means of the kenig - merle method  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most novel aspect of our implementation of this method lies with the rigidity argument .",
    "indeed , in order to prove theorem  [ main ] _ without any upper bound on the energy _ we demonstrate that the natural virial functional is globally coercive on  @xmath55 .",
    "this requires a detailed variational argument , the most delicate part of which consists of a phase - space analysis of the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "the advantage of this model lies with the fact that removing the unit ball eliminates the scaling symmetry and also renders the equation subcritical relative to the energy .",
    "both of these features are in stark contrast to the same equation on @xmath21-dimensional minkowski space , which is known to be super - critical and to develop singularities in finite time , see shatah  @xcite and also shatah , struwe  @xcite .",
    "another striking feature of this model , which fails for the @xmath56-dimensional analogue , lies with the fact that it admits infinitely many stationary solutions  @xmath57 which satisfy @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for each @xmath50 .",
    "these solutions have minimal energy in the class of all functions of finite energy which satisfy the  @xmath47 boundary condition at  @xmath48 , and they are the unique stationary solutions in that class .",
    "we denote the latter class by  @xmath60 .",
    "[ thm:2 ] for any @xmath50 there exists @xmath61 small with the property that for any smooth data @xmath62 such that @xmath63 the solution to   with data @xmath64 exists globally , is smooth , and scatters to @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "the same result applies as well to higher equivariance classes @xmath67 , after some fairly obvious modifications of the arguments in section  [ sec : boring ] .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to @xmath31 . scattering here",
    "means that on compact regions in space one has @xmath68 in the energy topology , or alternatively @xmath69 where @xmath70 solves .",
    "bizo , chmaj , and maliborski  @xcite conducted numerical experiments which suggest that theorem  [ thm:2 ] should hold with @xmath71 . not only does this conjecture appear out of reach , but even the non - perturbative regime @xmath72 seems inaccessible , at least by the methods of this paper .",
    "the main difficulty with the implementation of the kenig - merle method lies with the coercivity of the virial functional centered at the harmonic maps @xmath73 . indeed , in section  [ the rigidity argument ] ,",
    "we establish the global coercivity of the virial functional centered at zero .",
    "this hinges crucially on the fact that the euler - lagrange equation of the associated variational problem can be transformed into an autonomous system in the plane which we analyze by a rigorous study of the phase portrait . for the nonzero @xmath73",
    "we lose this reduction to an autonomous system , making any rigorous statement about the euler - lagrange equation associated to the virial functional centered at @xmath73 very difficult .",
    "furthermore , no explicit expression is known for the @xmath73 which makes even the perturbative analysis  in and of itself useless for the kenig - merle method  of this virial functional very non - obvious .",
    "it therefore seems that the case @xmath50 requires a different strategy from the one we employ here .",
    "one has the following version of hardy s inequality in @xmath74 : @xmath75 proved by integration by parts : @xmath76 and an application of cauchy - schwarz .",
    "this shows in particular that @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "another useful fact is the strauss estimate : @xmath79 which in particular implies that @xmath80 .",
    "since the nonlinearity in   is globally lipschitz due to @xmath32 , energy estimates immediately imply the following global well - posedness result . in",
    "what follows , @xmath81 where @xmath2 is the unit ball at the origin .",
    "[ prop:1 ] for any @xmath82 the cauchy problem has a unique global solution @xmath83 in the duhamel sense which depends continuously on the data .",
    "moreover , @xmath84 and we have persistence of regularity .    just write the equation in duhamel form and apply the standard energy estimate to obtain local well - posedness . to be more precise , we write @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the linear evolution of the wave equation in @xmath87 , with a dirichlet condition at @xmath88 ( everything can be taken to be radial , of course ) . by the conservation of energy one",
    "has @xmath89 whence @xmath90 so we can set up a contraction in the space @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is small depending only on the size of @xmath94 .",
    "the global statement therefore follows by energy conservation .    as in",
    "@xcite we refer to these energy duhamel solutions as _",
    "strong solutions_. for the scattering problem the formulation   is less convenient due to the linear term in the nonlinearity : @xmath95 the presence of the strong repulsive potential @xmath96 indicates that the linearized operator of   has more dispersion than the three - dimensional wave equation . in fact , it has the same dispersion as the five - dimensional wave equation as the following standard reduction shows .",
    "we set @xmath97 which leads to the equation @xmath98 the nonlinearity is of the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a smooth function , and the linear part is the dalembertian in @xmath101 .    to relate strong solutions of   with those of   we first note that @xmath102 via hardy s inequality and the relations @xmath103 therefore , the map @xmath104 is an isomorphism and in what follows we will use the notation @xmath55 for both spaces without further comment .",
    "second , there is the following strauss estimate in @xmath105 : @xmath106    [ prop:2 ] the exterior cauchy problem for   is globally well - posed in @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , a solution @xmath108 scatters as @xmath66 to a free wave , i.e. , a solution @xmath109 of @xmath110 if and only if @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "in particular , there exists a constant @xmath113 small so that if @xmath114 , then @xmath108 scatters to free waves as @xmath115 .    by the global strichartz estimates of smith - sogge  @xcite for the free wave equation outside a convex obstacle every energy solution of   satisfies",
    "@xmath116 we claim the embedding @xmath117 for radial functions in @xmath32 in @xmath105 . indeed , one checks via the fundamental theorem of calculus that @xmath118",
    ". more precisely ,",
    "@xmath106 interpolating this with the embedding @xmath119 we obtain the claim . from",
    "we infer the weaker strichartz estimate @xmath120 which suffices for our purposes . indeed , applying it to the equation @xmath121 and estimating the inhomogeneous term in @xmath122 , implies for any time interval @xmath123 @xmath124 by the usual continuity argument ( expanding @xmath125 ) this implies @xmath126 moreover , the scattering is also standard . indeed , denoting the free propagator in @xmath105 with a dirichlet boundary condition again by @xmath86 , we seek @xmath127 such that @xmath128 as @xmath66 . in view of the duhamel representation of @xmath129 and using the group property and unitarity of @xmath130 this is tantamount to @xmath131",
    "the integral on the right - hand side is absolutely convergent in @xmath55 provided @xmath111 .",
    "the necessity of the latter condition follows from the fact that free waves satisfy it , whence by the small data theory ( applied to large times ) it carries over to any nonlinear wave that scatters .",
    "we remark that in the @xmath28 formulation , the scattering of proposition  [ prop:2 ] means precisely  , .    to prove theorem  [ main ] we therefore need to show that every energy solution  @xmath28 of   has the property that in the @xmath108-formulation @xmath111 .",
    "this will be done by means of the kenig - merle concentration - compactness approach  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this section , we prove the following result .",
    "[ prop:3 ] suppose that theorem  [ main ] fails .",
    "then there exists a nonzero energy solution to   ( referred to as critical element ) @xmath132 for @xmath34 with the property that the trajectory @xmath133 is precompact in @xmath55 .    in the following section we then lead this to a contradiction via a virial - type rigidity argument . to prove proposition  [ prop:3 ] we may work in the @xmath108-formulation of equation   since the map @xmath134 is an isomorphism between @xmath55 in @xmath105 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "to proceed , we need the following version of the bahouri - grard decomposition  @xcite . as before , `` free '' waves refer to solutions of  .",
    "the following two lemmas are standard , see in particular chapter  2 of the book  @xcite .",

    "moreover , for any @xmath150 the embedding is compact .",
    "since @xmath140 is bounded in @xmath151 , interpolation with these , as well as the strichartz estimates from  @xcite implies that it suffices to bound the remainder in @xmath152 for any fixed @xmath153 .",
