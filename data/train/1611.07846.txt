    "it appears that magnetic order is retained in these small co - bz clusters .",

    "finally , based on the results of the dft calculations , we introduced a minimum quantum - spin model that accounts for both , magnetic anisotropies and inter - spin couplings .",
    "the results of the model suggest that the most stable configurations corresponds to a non - symmetric exchange interaction between the three cobalt atoms with a significant local anisotropy due to the benzene rings .",
    "we investigated the relaxed structures using electronic structure calculations resolved for spin within the dft framework .",

    "we have therefore shown that the benzene rings play a crucial role in the magnetic landscape of the co@xmath0bz@xmath0 cluster .",
    "to offer further insights into the responses of the magnetic properties , we built a quantum spin model hamiltonian that accounted for the low energy magnetic solutions of the electronic structure calculations .",
    "this hamiltonian contains local uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , associated with the presence of the benzene rings , and antiferromagnetic coupling between the spins of the co atoms .",
    "this approach leads to two possible stable configurations corresponding to different deviations from perfectly symmetric interactions .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric case , which displays spin frustration in the heisenberg limit,@xcite the anisotropic and asymmetric molecule leads to an effective total spin of @xmath94 .",

    "first , the distances between the cobalt atoms ( 2.34  ) were of the same order than the distance between a cobalt atom and the closest carbon , approximately @xmath126  .",
    "second , the charge of the cobalt ions in a cobz and the co@xmath0bz@xmath0 cluster differ by half an electron .",
    "third , the distances between cobalt atoms and the closest benzene plane changes by as much as 9@xmath127 .      * a ground state with magnetization in the cobalt atom plane , * a first excitation at @xmath128 mev , with in - plane magnetization , * a second excitation at @xmath129 mev ( in - plane magnetization ) , and * a third excitation at @xmath130 mev with out - of - plane magnetization .",
    "our approach to set the three parameters consisted of the following steps .",
    "first , for three different @xmath131 scenarios , we looked at the qualitative behavior of the energy spectra with the @xmath132 ratio between the limits of the isolated cobz units ( @xmath133 ) , and the isotropic cluster ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "crucially , the magnetic configurations resulting from the non - collinear calculations indicated the dominance of spin - exchange interactions over anisotropy , so the most natural scenario corresponded to @xmath135 .",
    "the excitation energies @xmath136 from the ground state are plotted against @xmath132 for three different @xmath131 values in fig .",
    "[ figs1 ] .",
    "we associated the first excitation with the dft electronic state at @xmath137 mev above the ground state .",
    "the second energy level was ascribed to the configurations found @xmath138 mev above the ground state .",
    "thus , we choose the parameters such that @xmath139 while keeping the gap @xmath140 as large as possible in terms of @xmath54 to avoid unrealistically large anisotropy barriers .",
    "the third magnetic configuration at @xmath141 mev , identified from the dft results as an afm configuration with out - of - plane magnetization , was taken as the third excited state of the model . comparing the energy spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:scale ] and fig .",
    "[ figs1 ] , we observe that the first two conditions are quantitatively satisfied for @xmath142 in the asymmetric case with @xmath143 or for @xmath144 $ ] with @xmath65",
    ". the symmetric configuration @xmath145 did not provide a qualitative agreement for any @xmath132 ratio .",
    "a more quantitative picture is obtained by inspection of the excitation spectrum versus @xmath131 , shown in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] .",
    "the @xmath146 and @xmath147 ratios were plotted versus @xmath131 for three different values of @xmath132 , with the ideal ratios close to 0 and 3.3 , respectively . for reference ,",
    "the corresponding excitation spectra are plotted in grey .",
    "the best agreement is found for @xmath67 and , especially , for @xmath64 .",
    "again , the symmetric case ( @xmath145 ) was far from the ideal ratios for any @xmath132 in the considered range of parameters .",
    "summing up , optimal agreement with the dft results was found for @xmath148 mev and @xmath149 mev .",
    "these values are higher than those typically found within smms .",
    "however , the cobalt centers in the co@xmath0bz@xmath0 cluster are much closer , so a direct exchange mechanism is possible .",
    "thus , it seems clear that both local magnetic anisotropy due to the benzene rings and the direct - exchange between the local moments associated to the co atoms plays a crucial role .      before trying to connect to an specific measurement",
    ", it is worth looking at the energy scales involved .",
    "if we denoted the excitation energies from the ground state to the first and second excited states as @xmath150 and @xmath140 respectively , and introducing the temperature @xmath151 , magnetic field @xmath152 , and frequency @xmath153 , we got the following energy scales at zero external field : @xmath154 mev ( @xmath155 k , @xmath156 t , and @xmath157 ghz ) , and @xmath158 mev ( @xmath159 k , @xmath160 t , and @xmath161 thz ) .",
    "this had the following consequences for the possible experimental observation .",
    "static measurements of the susceptibility may provide significant information about the lowest energy excitation for @xmath162 k. furthermore , for @xmath163 close to room temperature there may be other excitations not included here , like phonons .",
    "we had not found significant changes of the susceptibility with temperature or magnetic fields below 10 t. _ ac _ measurements of the dynamical susceptibility are also commonly used to extract additional magnetic information of smms , but the frequency range is limited to @xmath164$],@xcite clearly outside the energy range of interest .",
    "high @xmath165-field epr measurements may provide an accurate spectral information .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath81 t @xmath38-band , the electron spin resonance is found around @xmath166 ghz.@xcite for such an applied external field applied out of the co s plane , @xmath167 mev and @xmath168 mev ( @xmath169 ghz ) , within the range of experimental frequencies .",
    "epr experiments apply a fixed _ dc _ field along a given direction , which we defined as the quantization axis @xmath170 , and a small perpendicular _ ac _ field @xmath171 , along the @xmath172-axis . for the co - bz molecule ,",
    "the most convenient set - up corresponds to the @xmath38-band ( @xmath81 t ) with frequencies @xmath173 ghz .",
    "we used time dependent perturbation theory because the perpendicular _ ac _ field is much smaller , with typical intensities of the order of 1 g.    the absorbed power is given as the variation of the average energy @xmath174 $ ] with time , where @xmath175 is the density matrix .",
    "we here assumed a coherent dynamics .",
    "we used an interaction picture with respect to the term @xmath176 and a first order perturbative expansion for the density matrix operator .",
    "thus , the instantaneous power was given by @xmath177 , \\crcr & & \\label{ipower}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 , @xmath179 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath70 denotes the thermal equilibrium occupation of the energy level @xmath71 .",
    "there are however two considerations to be made in order to connect the absorbed power @xmath180 with the epr signal .",
    "first , the absorption signal of the epr measurement corresponds to the average of instantaneous power over a measurement time @xmath181 .",
    "second , the coupling of the spin system with the environment induces a dissipative dynamics .",
    "when two energy levels are close to resonance for a given frequency @xmath182 , i.e. , @xmath183 , the incoherent dynamics introduces two new time scales , the _ longitudinal or relaxation time _ @xmath184 and the _ transversal or decoherence time _ @xmath185.@xcite these two time scales determine the line - shape of the epr absorption spectra and , in particular , the width of the resonances , given essentially by @xmath186 .    when @xmath180 is averaged over a long period of time @xmath187 , the first term cancels . for a frequency window @xmath188 , the _ steady - state _",
    "absorbed power is then proportional to @xmath189 .",
    "the incoherent dynamics modifies the time dependence in the last part of eq .",
    "( [ ipower ] ) which , in the frequency domain , leads to a finite resonant amplitude and a finite frequency width .",
    "we approximated this frequency dependence using the collision broadened profile of van vleck and weisskopf ( 1945),@xcite @xmath190 where @xmath75 takes the form @xmath191 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , we should keep in mind that this epr line shape does not account for saturation effects and the associated temperature increment , which for a typical _ ac _ field of @xmath192 g occurs for longitudinal relaxation time @xmath193s .",
    ", versus the angle @xmath84 formed by the normal to the co s plane and the _ dc _ magnetic field ( @xmath194 ) .",
