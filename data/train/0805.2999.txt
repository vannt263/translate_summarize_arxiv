    "precise values for the qcd coupling @xmath8 and the charm quark s mass  @xmath9 are important for high - precision tests of the standard model . some of the most accurate mass determinations currently come from zero - momentum moments of current - current correlators built from the @xmath0  quark s electromagnetic current ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "low moments are perturbative and have long been known through three - loop order  @xcite .",
    "new techniques have recently extended these results to much higher moments  @xcite and , in some cases , to four - loop order  @xcite .",
    "these moments can be estimated nonperturbatively , using dispersion relations , from experimental data for the electron - positron annihilation cross section , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath0  quark s mass is extracted by comparing the perturbative and experimental determinations .    in this paper",
    "we show how to compute such moments directly using accurately tuned , highly realistic numerical simulations of qcd in the lattice approximation  @xcite .",
    "as we will show , the correlator moments obtained nonperturbatively from such simulations can be used in place of data from @xmath11  annihilation to obtain new , percent - accurate determinations of the @xmath0  quark s mass . with lattice",
    "qcd , it is also possible to replace the electromagnetic current in the correlator by the pseudoscalar operator @xmath12 , thereby providing a completely new set of mass determinations and an important cross check on the entire methodology .",
    "in fact the pseudoscalar correlators are particularly easy to simulate , and there are no renormalization factors required since the corresponding axial - vector current is partially conserved in our lattice formalism . consequently these correlators give our most accurate masses .",
    "they also give very accurate values for the qcd coupling , when combined with our new four - loop results from perturbation theory .    in section  [ corr - from - latt ]",
    "we describe how to compute pseudoscalar correlators and their moments using lattice qcd .",
    "we discuss techniques for reducing lattice artifacts in section  [ sec : qcd_simulations ] , and present new determinations of the @xmath0-quark mass and qcd coupling from our lattice `` data '' in section  [ sec : mc ] . in section  [ sec : other ] we extend our analysis to include vector and axial - vector correlators .",
    "we summarize our main results in section  [ concl ] . in the appendix we review the continuum perturbation theory needed for this analysis , including new four - loop results for the pseudoscalar and vector cases .",
    "few - percent accurate qcd simulations have only become possible in the last few years ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , and accurate simulations of relativistic @xmath0  quarks only in the past year  with the new highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) discretization of the quark action  @xcite , which we use here .",
    "a lattice qcd simulation proceeds in two steps . first the qcd parameters  the bare coupling constant and bare quark masses in the lagrangian  must be tuned .",
    "then the tuned simulation is used to compute vacuum matrix elements of various quantum operators from which physics is extracted . an obvious approach to the tuning is to choose a lattice spacing  @xmath13 , and then tune each of the qcd parameters so that the simulation reproduces the experimental value for a corresponding physical quantity that is well measured .",
    "it is more efficient , however , to first choose a value for the bare coupling and then adjust the lattice spacing and bare masses to give physical results .    in the simulations used here , we set the lattice spacing to reproduce the correct @xmath14  meson mass difference in the simulations  @xcite , while we tune the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 and  @xmath17 masses to give correct values for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "( for efficiency we set @xmath22 ; this leads to negligible errors in the analysis presented here . )",
    "the important parameters for the particular simulations used in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : param ] ; further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "once these parameters are set , there are no further physics parameters , and the simulation will accurately reproduce qcd physics for momenta much smaller than the ultraviolet  ( uv ) cutoff  ( @xmath23 ) .    we have tested these simulations extensively ( see , for example , @xcite ) and , in particular , we have done very precise tests for the charm - quark physics most relevant to this work .",
    "these demonstrate , for example , that our simulations reproduce the low - lying spectrum , including spin structure , of both charmonium and heavy - light mesons ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) to within our simulation uncertainties ( a few percent or less )  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0  mass can be determined from moments with @xmath50 given @xmath42 from lattice simulations and @xmath49 from perturbation theory ( see appendix ) , while the qcd coupling can be determined from the dimensionless moment  @xmath51 .",
    "this assumes that perturbation theory is applicable , which should be the case for small enough  @xmath52 .",
    "note that here and elsewhere in this paper we omit annihilation contributions from @xmath53 .",
    "this is allowed provided we omit the same contributions from perturbation theory .",
    "annihilation contributions to the nonperturbative part of our analysis would be negligible ( for example , they shift the @xmath54  mass by approximately  2.4mev , which is less than  0.1%  @xcite ) .",
    "the biggest challenge when using lattice qcd to produce @xmath0-quark correlator moments is controlling : 1 ) @xmath55 errors caused by the lattice approximation ; and 2 ) tuning errors in the qcd parameters , and especially in the lattice spacing and the @xmath0-quark s bare mass . we reduce each of these sources of error by making two modifications to the moments .",
    "first we replace @xmath42 by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58  moment of the correlator to lowest order in lattice qcd perturbation theory  @xcite , and @xmath59 is the lowest - order part of @xmath49 in continuum perturbation theory .",
    "the lowest - order on - shell or `` pole '' mass of the @xmath0-quark sets the mass scale in the lowest - order lattice moments : @xmath60 in the hisq formalism , this mass is related to the mass @xmath35 that appears in the action by  @xcite : @xmath61 introducing @xmath57 removes the explicit factors of the lattice spacing in the denominator of  eq .",
    "( [ gn - def ] ) , and also cancels finite-@xmath13 errors to all orders in  @xmath13 and zeroth order in  @xmath62 .",
    "thus we expect finite-@xmath13 errors that are reduced by a factor of order  @xmath63 when we divide @xmath42 by the corresponding lowest - order lattice moment ; and we find in practice that they are 34  times smaller .",
    "a second modification is to replace the pole mass in @xmath64 by the value of the @xmath54 mass obtained from the simulation , @xmath65 ( in lattice units )  @xcite : @xmath66 up to @xmath67 corrections . with this additional factor ,",
    "the leading dependence on @xmath47 enters through the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "consequently small errors in the simulation parameter @xmath29 are mostly cancelled in this expression by corresponding shifts in the simulation value for  @xmath65 .",
    "this cancellation is accurate up to binding corrections of order  @xmath69 in  @xmath20 , and therefore the impact of any tuning error in  @xmath35 is three times smaller with this modification  @xcite .",
    "combining these two modifications , we replace @xmath42 by a reduced moment : @xmath70 the reduced moments can again be written in terms of continuum quantities : @xmath71 up to @xmath67 corrections , where @xmath72 is obtained from @xmath49 ( eq .  ( [ gn - def ] ) ) and its value , @xmath59 , in lowest - order continuum perturbation theory : @xmath73     and a ratio of these moments from lattice simulations with different lattice spacings  @xmath13 .",
    "the tight clusters of points at each of the three largest lattice spacings correspond to results for different sea - quark masses .",
    "the dashed lines show the functions used to fit the lattice results , with the sea - quark masses set equal to the masses used at the smallest lattice spacing .",
