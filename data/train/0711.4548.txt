    "the history of underluminous sne  ia is a typical example of the ever - recurring pattern in which knowledge about nature is accumulated .",
    "usually , in the beginning there is the observation of a phenomenon , followed by a successful theoretical explanation .",
    "however , as further experiments or observations are carried out in order to confirm the newly developed theoretical ideas , often an ever higher degree of diversity and ever more exceptions from the simple rules are found the closer the subject of interest is studied .",
    "the need for refined and more complex theories to obtain a realistic description of the involved processes becomes evident .    in the case of sne",
    "ia , first a class of cosmic explosions apparently similar in absolute luminosity ( `` standard candles '' ) and spectroscopic appearance was identified .",
    "these events were explained as the disruptions of white dwarfs which had accreted matter until they reached their stability limit close to the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , in 1991 the paradigm of sn  ia homogeneity had to be relaxed a lot .",
    "this was triggered by the observation of two peculiar sne  ia , which thereafter served as prototypes of newly - defined sn  ia subclasses with distinct spectrophotometric properties .",
    "one of these , sn  1991 t ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , was up to @xmath9 mag brighter than average sne  ia , and characterised by a hot early - time spectrum with strong feiii features and weak or absent siii and sii lines .",
    "the other one , sn  1991bg @xcite was even more deviant , with low ejecta velocities and a cool spectrum dominated by intermediate - mass - element ( ime ) lines and particularly strong oi and tiii .",
    "moreover , it had unusually red colours at early phases , and was underluminous by about @xmath10 mag at peak ( hereafter we will refer to such appearance as 91bg - like ) .",
    "hence , quasi instantaneously the luminosity range of sne  ia had increased to a factor of ten between the brightest and the faintest objects , proving that they were _ no _ standard candles . however , two years later @xcite realised a tight correlation between peak luminosity and decline rate in the @xmath2 band .",
    "this relation and revised versions of it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) turned sne  ia into standardisable candles , and hence made them an extremely useful tool for precision cosmology .    in the following years ,",
    "several more 91bg - like sne  ia were discovered , but the available data set grew much less rapidly than for ordinary sne  ia . from the results of the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) and the beijing astronomical observatory supernova survey ( baoss ) , @xcite estimated that about @xmath11% of all sne  ia are of the 91bg - like variety .",
    "this may still be an underestimate , as their low intrinsic luminosity makes 91bg - like sne prone to malmquist bias ; nevertheless @xcite estimated this effect to be negligible in their sample .",
    "statistical studies @xcite have shown that sne  ia occur in all host - galaxy types , but revealed a correlation between sn decline rate and host morphology , with a clear tendency for 91bg - like sne to be associated with early - type hosts and hence old stellar populations .    while the single - degenerate ( sd ) chandrasekhar - mass model has survived as the favoured scenario for the normal and indeed rather homogeneous sne  ia , a number of alternative models have been suggested for the 91bg - like subclass .",
    "ideas include double - degenerate ( dd ) explosions of merging white dwarfs , sub - chandrasekhar - mass explosions triggered by detonation of the accreted helium layer ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , and deflagrations in strongly rotating white dwarfs , where the turbulent propagation of the flame front is suppressed by the differential rotation @xcite . still ,",
    "the notion that 91bg - like sne are  in terms of the underlying explosion model  no different from ordinary sne  ia , and that the only discriminating parameter is the mass of synthesised @xmath12ni , has supporters in the sn  ia community .",
    "no conclusive evidence for any of these ideas has been found so far . in this paper",
    "we present the joint data set of sn  2005bl obtained by the european supernova collaboration ( esc)/www.mpa - garching.mpg.de/@xmath13rtn/ ] and the carnegie supernova project ( csp)/www.csp1.lco.cl/@xmath13cspuser1/pub / csp.html ] .",
    "since these observations are among the earliest ever obtained for a 91bg - like sn , they may help to better constrain possible progenitor and explosion models .",
    "the observations and techniques applied for data reduction and calibration are discussed in section  [ observations and data reduction ] . in section  [ distance and extinction ]",
    "we estimate the distance of sn  2005bl and the extinction along the line of sight .",

    "sn  2005bl ( @xmath14 = 0.024 ) was discovered in the course of the lick observatory supernova search programme ( loss ) with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) on ut 2005 april 14.34 and 15.36 at unfiltered magnitudes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the sne with @xmath3m@xmath33@xmath43@xmath20 to @xmath44 ( green symbols ) clearly have double - peaked @xmath41-band light curves , and , as in normal - luminosity sne  ia , the first @xmath41-band peak precedes that of the @xmath2 band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : lc_faint ] ) also exhibit noticeable differences in shape , probably influenced by the evolution of the ti trough .",
    "91bg - like sne settle to the radioactive tail earlier , only @xmath13@xmath45d after maximum light .",
    "consequently , the drop in magnitude from the peak to the tail is smaller for these , although their initial decline is steeper .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 light curves of 91bg - like and `` normal '' sne  ia can not be transformed into each other by employing a simple strech factor .",
    "the only objects in the sample with @xmath46m@xmath47 are sne  1986 g and 1998bp ( yellow symbols ) .",
    "the light - curve morphology of these sne seems to provide a link between the formerly defined groups .",
    "while the @xmath41 band is still single - peaked with maybe a hint of a double peak , the luminosity drop from maximum to the radioactive tail in the @xmath2 band resembles that of sne with @xmath3m@xmath48 .",
    "the existence of objects with such intermediate properties might support the idea of a common progenitor and explosion scenario for _ all _ sne  ia .",

    "the differences in @xmath51 after @xmath52d are marginal , and all sne obey the @xcite relation within the uncertainties ( note , however , that for the more strongly - reddened sne  1986 g and 2005bl the lira relation was directly or indirectly used to infer the true extinction along the line of sight , making this a circular argument ) . on the contrary , the @xmath51 colour evolution around maximum light shows remarkable differences , the 91bg - like sne  ia having a much redder colour at maximum ( @xmath54 to @xmath55 mag , compared to @xmath13@xmath56 mag for sne  ia with @xmath3m@xmath57 ) .",
    "also , the peak @xmath51 colour is reached earlier in underluminous sne , and is redder by @xmath13@xmath58 mag .    in @xmath50",

    "91bg - like sne , in contrast , do not show the initial bluening , but become redder from the very first available observations onwards .",
    "this behaviour continues until @xmath13@xmath45d past maximum , when the curves flatten and subsequently a soft bluening sets in .",
    "evidently , the origin of the different @xmath50 evolution lies in the different delay of the main maximum and the presence or absence of the secondary maximum in the @xmath41 band .      - and @xmath40-band magnitudes of the sn sample of table  [ sne_faint ] .",

    "rise times of sne  ia are important to constrain possible explosion models . in our synthetic spectra the rise time @xmath75 determines the actual ( scaled ) density profile at a given epoch ( cf . section  [ code concept ] ) , and hence the matter density of the line - forming region . here",
    "we report our attempts to estimate the rise time of 91bg - like sne , in particular of sn  2005bl .",
    "efforts have been made to measure sn - ia rise times directly from a fit to their early - time light curves @xcite .",
    "depending on measurement details , these studies yield rise times of @xmath76 to @xmath62d for fiducial @xmath3m@xmath77 sne  ia . furthermore , there seems to be a negative correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath3m@xmath33 , faster decliners having shorter rise times .",
    "however , all these studies are based on samples of `` normal '' sne  ia with @xmath3m@xmath78 , and it may be doubted whether the inferred trends can be extrapolated to 91bg - like sne with @xmath3m@xmath79 .    what makes these direct measurements so demanding is the need for high - quality early - time photometry , preferentially before day @xmath80 @xcite , which to date is not available for any 91bg - like sn , including 2005bl . in order to constrain the rise times of this class of objects",
    ", it may be useful to consider the two 91bg - like sne  ia with the earliest photometric data , sne  1998de and 1999by .",

    "the earliest detection on unfiltered ccd frames dates back to day @xmath83 , showing the sn at only @xmath84% of the peak @xmath85-luminosity @xcite .",

[ fig:99by_rise ] ) , a rise time to @xmath2-band",
    "maximum of @xmath90would be inferred for sn  1999by , the errors being the 3-@xmath91 confidence levels of the fit combined with the uncertainty in determining the epoch of @xmath2-band maximum @xcite .     vs. @xmath92 , and linear fit ( dotted line ) to the data up to day @xmath93 ( between the two thin vertical lines ) .",

    "section  [ parameters and composition ] ) , it should require some time for the photons to reach the photosphere and be released . this could result in an initial post - explosion phase with only very little brightening of the sn , before the observed steep rise of the light curve sets in .",
    "for this reason , the inferred value of @xmath98d might be considered a _ lower limit _ to the actual rise time of sn  1999by .",
    "given the similarity in terms of light - curve shape , this result should provide a good indication also for the rise time of sn  2005bl .",
    "the rise time constitutes an important input parameter for our spectrum synthesis calculations . since the colour of an observed spectrum has to be reproduced in a corresponding model , the photospheric temperature , which can be crudely approximated through the stefan - boltzmann - law @xmath99 , is confined to a limited range .",
    "assuming a shorter rise time , the photospheric velocity thus usually has to be increased in order to keep the photospheric temperature constant .",
    "the line velocities in the synthetic spectrum then also tend to be larger .",
    "given the difficulties in observational rise - time determination , we created eight models with different rise times ( @xmath100@xmath101d ) for the earliest available spectrum of sn  2005bl ( @xmath0d ) , where a change in @xmath75 has the largest relative effect .",
    "excluding models largely deviating from the observed spectrum yielded a range of acceptable rise times .",
    "for the models with @xmath102d , we had to use photospheric velocities of @xmath103 kms@xmath25 , which are incompatible with observed and measured ( fig .",

    "most weaker lines were fitted nicely , while in stronger lines such as siii @xmath106 or caii h&k there was still a lack of absorption at low velocity . while weaker lines mostly form near the photosphere , strong lines have considerable strength also in layers well above .",
    "thus , their centroid typically shows a larger blueshift , and their emission , centred at the rest wavelength , is more pronounced . in order to decrease the flux in their red wings",
    ", @xmath107 had to be reduced to @xmath108@xmath109 kms@xmath25 , corresponding to rise times of @xmath110@xmath62d .",
    "the weaker features , however , then appeared at velocities too low in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the difficulty to match all line - velocities simultaneously points to some substantial shortcoming in our treatment of the sn ejecta . stratifying the ejecta composition @xcite assuming only little si and ca at high velocity",
    "might cure some of the problems , as it could potentially remove the blue parts of the respective strong absorption lines and reduce their re - emission .",
    "yet , we retained our uniform - abundance approach , because no observational data earlier than @xmath0d are available to constrain the additional parameters of a stratified - abundance model .",
    "alternative explanations for the inconsistencies include a possible inadequacy of the w7 density structure , a deviation of the total ejected mass from @xmath8 , or 3d effects .    nonetheless , based on our model sequence ,",

    "spectrum synthesis calculations offer an insight into the chemical composition of the ejecta , making it possible to trace the nuclear reactions that took place during explosive burning .",
    "however , because of the limitations and possible shortcomings of the models mentioned in section  [ spectral modelling ] ( i.e. , no abundance stratification , use of a chandrasekhar - mass progenitor and of the w7 density distribution ) , the exact numbers in table  [ model parameters ] should be taken with caution .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to analysing clear trends , which should be robust with respect to refined models .      as for all rapidly - declining sne  ia the spectrum of sn  2005bl",
    "is characterised by strong oi@xmath122 .",
    "the strength of this line is largely a temperature effect , as the comparatively low temperatures encountered in 91bg - like sne  ia result in a fair fraction of neutral oxygen besides the singly ionised state which normally dominates the ejecta .",
    "nevertheless , it also signals the presence of a significant amount of unburned material in the sn ejecta .",
    "this is fully consistent with the often - anticipated low burning efficiency of these objects ( from light curves and nebular spectra one can infer that the amount of synthesised @xmath12ni is @xmath13@xmath123@xmath124 , which is at most a quarter of that in normal - luminosity sne  ia , @xcite ) .",
    "direct information on the oxygen abundance is difficult to derive from synthetic spectra , since oi@xmath122 is the only strong feature of this element at optical wavelengths , and is heavily saturated in all our models .",
    "hence , moderate changes in the oxygen content have no impact on the strength of this feature .",
    "additionally , our abundance estimate should be considered an upper limit , as , guided by nuclear reaction network calculations , we ascribe the entire mass without observable signatures to oxygen .",
    "d spectrum of sn  2005bl and the @xmath93d spectrum of sn  1999by shows a flux deficit at @xmath125  in sn  2005bl , likely caused by c ii @xmath126 .",
    "the insert shows synthetic spectra for day @xmath0 , one with the composition reported in table  [ model parameters ] including @xmath127% of c , the other without any c.,width=317 ]    applying this strategy , we find oxygen mass fractions ranging from @xmath128 at day @xmath0 to @xmath13@xmath129 at day @xmath121 . with a w7 density profile and photospheric velocities of @xmath130 and @xmath109 kms@xmath25 , about @xmath131 and @xmath132 of the ejecta mass",
    "are located above the photospheres at days @xmath0 and @xmath121 , respectively . hence , if a chandrasekhar - mass explosion with w7 density profile provides an acceptable model for 91bg - like sne  ia , at least the outer @xmath133 of the ejecta of sn  2005bl and other members of this group are entirely dominated by unburned material .",
    "these numbers are significantly different from the results obtained by modelling normal sne  ia ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they are also in disagreement with the picture sketched in the zorro plot @xcite , i.e. that all lvg and faint sne  ia have about the same amount of unburned material , and that the observed spectrophotometric sequence among sne  ia has its origin only in a variable ratio of @xmath12ni to imes .",
    "another indication of the low burning efficiency in sn  2005bl is the likely detection of unprocessed carbon in its early spectra .",
    "although the s / n of the @xmath0 and @xmath97d spectra is low , a clear flux deficit redwards of the siii @xmath7 absorption can be discerned compared to coeval spectra of sn  1999by ( fig .",
    "[ fig : carbon ] ) .",
    "synthetic spectra enable us to investigate the effect of including different chemical species on this region .",
    "there are only few lines which could potentially contribute to the observed absorption.  proved to be a preferential window for flux redistributed from shorter wavelengths to escape .",
    "all elements which create opacity in the blue and uv part of the spectrum ( fe - group elements , ti , cr , other metals ) rather led to an increase of the @xmath125  flux excess in the model .",
    "this in turn yielded constraints on the metal abundance . ]",
    "including hydrogen did not improve the model , since the resulting h@xmath134 absorption was at too short a wavelength , and h@xmath134 emission deteriorated the fit around @xmath135 .",
    "a clearly better match to the observed spectrum was obtained introducing carbon , as cii lines not only cropped the flux peak at @xmath125   through cii @xmath126 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : carbon ] , insert ) , but also improved the fit in other regions , most notably around @xmath136  ( through cii @xmath137 ) .",
    "therefore , we consider the presence of a few percent of carbon in the ejecta at days @xmath0 and @xmath97 very likely .    the temperature and density conditions for carbon burning are more relaxed than those for oxygen burning , so that carbon is burned much more completely to heavier elements than oxygen . in fact , only in some  usually very early ( @xmath13@xmath80d )  optical spectra of sne  ia have clear signatures of carbon ever been found ( most prominently in sn  2006gz , @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "none of these sne was 91bg - like , although the lower burning efficiency in these objects might favour the presence of unprocessed carbon .",
    "the lack of spectra taken earlier than @xmath61d before maximum light may have so far prevented the detection of carbon .",
    "in sn  2005bl , however , we are confident that signatures of carbon are present less than one week before maximum .",
    "this constitutes one of the few detections of cii in sn  ia spectra at such a relatively late epoch ; previous cases include sne  1996x and 2006d @xcite .",
    "the fe - group abundance of sn  2005bl of @xmath13@xmath138 at day @xmath0 and @xmath13@xmath139 at day @xmath121 is about two orders of magnitude lower than in normal - luminosity sne  ia at comparable epochs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at a first glance",
    "this looks perfectly consistent with the low luminosity and hence the low production of @xmath12ni and other nse - elements in a 91bg - like sn  ia .",
    "however , closer examination reveals that the fe content of the pre - maximum models is significantly sub - solar . at @xmath0d",
    "the best - fitting model contains no ni or co , and only @xmath140% of stable fe .",
    "acceptable results were obtained with fe abundances up to @xmath141% , but also without any fe ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : x(fe ) ] ) .",
    "solar fe abundances ( the fe mass fraction of the sun s photosphere is about @xmath142% , @xcite ) can safely be ruled out , as with this amount of fe the quality of the fit deteriorates a lot around @xmath108 .",
    "now , the fe content deduced not only accounts for @xmath143fe synthesised during the explosive burning ( the @xmath12ni decay chain has too long decay times to give a relevant contribution at these epochs ) , but also for fe already present in the progenitor star before the explosion .",
    "hence , a sub - solar fe content of the precursor star might be inferred . on the other hand",
    ", sn  2005bl exploded in an elliptical galaxy , a presumably not metal - poor environment .",
    "if the chemical composition of the precursor did not deviate significantly from the average material in ngc  4070 , it rather should have had a fairly high fe abundance , and nuclear burning should have further enriched the ejecta with fe - group elements , although this may be confined to the inner shells .",
    "to @xmath123% ( the latter roughly represents solar fe abundance ) .",
    "the observed but smoothed @xmath0d spectrum is shown in black .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting spectrum ( with x(fe)@xmath144% ) are summarised in table  [ model parameters ] .",
    "the other spectra have been obtained by changing only the amount of stable fe at the expense of o , the most abundant element , without attempting to optimise the fit by adapting other parameters .",
    "hence , better fits might be feasible also for the models with x(fe)@xmath145%.,width=317 ]    there may be two ways to explain the small amount of fe required to fit the early - time spectra of sn  2005bl .",
    "one is to assume that fe was not distributed homogeneously in the progenitor star , but concentrated towards the centre .",
    "a certain degree of gravitational settling of heavier elements can indeed be expected . estimating whether or not this effect is sufficient to yield fe abundances in accordance to those inferred from the synthetic spectra would require a model of gravitational diffusion inside the white dwarf , and accurate constraints on the mass accretion rate from the companion and the composition of the accreted material .",
    "note , however , that assuming @xmath146 kms@xmath25 and a w7 density profile the photosphere at day @xmath0 is not located in the outermost layers , but half the way down the ejecta in mass coordinates .",
    "alternatively , the progenitor of sn  2005bl might have had a metallicity truly lower than the average metallicity of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "this could be explained if the progenitor was rather old ( @xmath1310 gyr ) , formed before the ism in ngc  4070 was metal - enriched through recurrent cycles of stellar birth , mass loss and death .",
    "if this scenario held true , it would provide one of the first direct constraints on the lifetime of an individual sn  ia progenitor . given the spectroscopic similarity of sn  2005bl to sne  1991bg , 1997cn , 1998de and 1999by , and given that most of the latter sne also exploded in early - type , supposedly metal - rich galaxies ( see table  [ sne_faint ] ) ,",
    "this could point towards a very long - lived progenitor population for _ all _ underluminous , 91bg - like sne  ia .",
    "a speculation could be that 91bg - like sne  ia descend from white - dwarf mergers ( dd scenario ) .",
    "white - dwarf binary systems should meet the requirement of long lifetimes because of the low efficiency of angular - momentum loss through gravitational - wave emission .",
    "in fact , in a study of the delay - time distribution of sne  ia , @xcite identified initially wide white - dwarf pairs as the only progenitor model whose delay - time distribution does not drop dramatically beyond @xmath138 gyr .",
    "models of @xcite lend further support to the dd scenario , as they predict that no sne  ia should occur in sd systems for [ fe / h ] @xmath147 , a limit which may be exceeded by sn  2005bl . finally , from spectropolarimetric observations of sn  1999by @xcite inferred a degree of asphericity much higher than in ordinary sne  ia . on this basis",
    "they identified rapidly rotating white dwarfs and merging white - dwarf binaries as the most promising progenitor candidates for 91bg - like sne  ia . a different progenitor system with respect to ordinary sne  ia ( for which the sd scenario consisting of a white dwarf and a non - degenerate companion is favoured ) , and in particular the possibility that the mass is different from @xmath8 , could account for observed differences in the photometric and spectroscopic properties of 91bg - like sne .",
    "we have presented and analysed optical photometric and spectroscopic data of the underluminous type ia sn  2005bl from one week before to two months after maximum light in @xmath2 . in this entire interval",
    "the evolution of sn  2005bl is substantially different from that of slow or intermediate decliners , but very similar to that of the prototypical fast decliners sne  1991bg and 1999by . at peak ,",
    "sn  2005bl appears slightly more luminous than the latter , but the difference is marginal and within the error bars , which for sn  2005bl are dominated by uncertainties in the amount of host - galaxy extinction . with respect to quantities like the @xmath3m@xmath33 of @xmath148 , the ejecta velocities inferred from the minimum of the siii @xmath7 line , and temperature indicators such as @xmath6(si ) or the time - evolution of various colour indices , sn  2005bl",
    "is in fact  within the measurement uncertainties  a clone of sne  1991bg and 1999by .",
    "we confirm that @xmath3m@xmath33 is a good luminosity indicator also for underluminous sne  ia , with a steeper dependence of the peak magnitudes on @xmath3m@xmath33 than for slow and intermediate decliners . from linear fits",
    "we obtain @xmath149 and @xmath150 for the @xmath2 and @xmath40 band , respectively , considering objects with @xmath3m@xmath63 .",
    "we conducted an analysis analogous to that of @xcite , focussing on the behaviour of the faint subclass and trying to identify trends within this group .",
    "in addition to the sne in benetti et  al .",
    "we not only added the measurements of sn  2005bl , but also included sn  1998de @xcite and updated some numbers on the basis of better data availability .",
    "we find a correlation between @xmath3m@xmath33 and @xmath6(si)@xmath115 , nicely extending the observed linear trend among hvg and lvg sne to larger decline rates . because of the lack of early data , the time - evolution of @xmath6(si ) at phases where differences between the lvg and hvg groups become evident can not be investigated .",
    "the siii line velocities of faint sne are mostly similar to those of lvg sne near maximum light , but significantly lower a few weeks later .",
    "there is a large dispersion in post - maximum velocity gradients @xmath114 within the faint class , with numbers comparable to those of hvg sne , but exceeding their range in both directions .",
    "synthetic spectra for sn  2005bl at four epochs before and soon after maximum light have been computed using a 1d monte carlo code . despite uncertainties and shortcomings such as the poorly - constrained rise time , the possible inadequacy of the w7 density profile for 91bg - like sne  ia , and",
    "the fact that computations were performed without chemical stratification , a number of interesting results were obtained .",
    "the presence of carbon in the @xmath0 and @xmath97d spectra , indicated by a visual comparison with sn  1999by at similar epoch , was confirmed , and an overall low burning efficiency was established .",
    "nse elements , but also imes , are significantly less abundant than in ordinary sne  ia ; instead , most of the ejecta above @xmath109 kms@xmath25 are made of oxygen , and are hence either unburned or the result of highly incomplete carbon burning .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath0 and @xmath97d spectra only traces of fe are found , one order of magnitude less than expected for unprocessed material with solar composition .",
    "possible implications of this low metallicity on the nature of the progenitor were discussed in section  [ element abundances from synthetic spectra ] .",
    "it is presently very difficult to decide whether 91bg - like sne  ia form a separate group , distinct from ordinary sne  ia and possibly descending from different progenitors or explosion mechanisms , or whether they are just the extreme end of a continuous distribution of objects , with their characteristic appearance owing to lower temperatures in conjunction with a different chemical composition , both caused by the overall low burning efficiency . to tackle",
    "this problem will require a new statistical analysis similar to that of @xcite once a bigger sample of rapidly - declining sne  ia will be available , and more detailed spectral modelling of the data sets already published .",
