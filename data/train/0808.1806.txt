    "superfluid turbulence consists of a disordered tangle of quantized vortex filaments which move under the velocity field of each other@xcite .",
    "if the temperature , @xmath1 is sufficiently smaller than the critical temperature , @xmath2 , then the normal fluid can be neglected and the vortices do not experience any friction effect@xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the vortex structures ( discrete vortex lines ) and the absence of dissipation mechanisms , such as friction and viscosity , make superfluid turbulence a remarkable fluid system , particularly when compared to turbulence in ordinary fluids .",
    "current experimental , theoretical and numerical investigations attempt to determine the similarities and the dissimilarities between superfluid turbulence and ordinary turbulence .",
    "questions which are currently addressed concern ( i ) the existence of a kolmogorov energy cascade at length scales larger than the typical intervortex spacing@xcite , ( ii ) the existence of a kelvin wave cascade at length scales smaller than the kolmogorov length@xcite followed by ( iii ) acoustic emission at even shorter length scales@xcite , ( iv ) the possible existence of a bottleneck@xcite between the kolmogorov cascade and the kelvin wave cascade , ( v ) the nature of the fluctuations of the observed vortex line density@xcite and ( vi ) their decay@xcite , ( vii ) whether there are two forms of turbulence@xcite , a structured one , which consists of many length scales ( kolmogorov turbulence ) , and an unstructured , more random one ( vinen turbulence ) , ( viii ) the effects of rotation on turbulence@xcite .",
    "most of these questions refer to the important limit @xmath3 , where fundamental distinctions between a perfect euler fluid and a superfluid becomes apparent@xcite .",
    "superfluid turbulence experiments are currently performed in both @xmath4he @xcite and in @xmath0he - b @xcite . in the last few years",
    "it has been recognized that , to make progress in answering the above questions , it is necessary to develop better measurement techniques which are suitable for turbulence in quantum fluids . in @xmath4he , the application of the classical piv method@xcite was a breakthrough . in @xmath0he - b ,",
    "a non  classical , powerful measurement technique which is suitable in the limit @xmath3 is the andreev scattering@xcite , developed at the university of lancaster .    this article is concerned with the andreev scattering .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we shall describe the basic ideas behind the andreev scattering and review what is a quantized vortex line . in section iii",
    "we shall write down the governing equations of motion . in section iv we shall determine the ballistic trajectories of excitations in the vicinity of the velocity field of a vortex line , and , in section v , we shall study the transport of heat by ballistic quasiparticles through a tangle of vortices .",
    "section vi will apply our result to the current experiments . finally , in section vii",
    ", we shall draw the conclusions .",
    "the study of the motion of quasiparticle excitations in a superfluid was pioneered by andreev@xcite .",
    "consider an excitation which moves in the direction of increasing excitation gap .",
    "the excitation propagates at constant energy , and gradually reaches the minimum of the rising excitation spectrum , where its group velocity becomes zero .",
    "thereafter it retraces its path but as an excitation on the other side of the minimum .",
    "an incoming quasiparticle is thus reflected as a quasihole and an incoming quasihole is reflected as a quasiparticle .",
    "the effect is a consequence of the fact that the minimum of the energy spectrum of the excitation lies at nonzero momentum .",
    "the case of @xmath5-wave triplet pairing appropriate to superfluid @xmath0he has been discussed by various authors studying the interaction of excitations with the boundaries@xcite , motion of quasiparticles through the @xmath6-@xmath7 phase boundary in @xmath0he@xcite , ballistic motion of quasi  particle in slow varying textural field of @xmath0he - a@xcite , scattering of ballistic quasiparticles in @xmath0he - b by a moving solid surface @xcite , and calculation of the friction force on quantized vortices@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are concerned with andreev reflection within the vortex core and therefore apply to the bound states .",
    "our concern is the propagation of thermal excitations outside vortex cores .",
    "collisions between the quasiparticles can cause some spreading of the incoming beam .",
    "however , the spreading can be made arbitrary small by lowering the density of the excitations , that is to say , by lowering the temperature . at low enough temperatures the mean free path exceeds the dimensions of the experimental cell and we can consider undamped excitations moving along straight paths until they hit a boundary or any potential barrier , particularly a barrier formed by a vortex .",
    "andreev reflection of excitations thus gives the opportunity to probe flows in superfluid @xmath0he at ultra ",
    "low temperatures .",
    "the most fruitful and promising application of andreev scattering is thus superfluid turbulence in @xmath0he - b in the low temperature limit , that is to say for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "superfluid @xmath0he - b is described by a macroscopic wave function , called the order parameter , with a well defined phase @xmath9 .",
    "the superfluid velocity @xmath10 is proportional to the gradient of the phase , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of one @xmath0he atom .",
    "consequently , in contrast to classical fluids , superfluid motion is irrotational and vorticity exist only in the form of quantized vortices . quantized vortices are line defects around which the phase @xmath9 changes by @xmath13 .",
    "the superfluid order parameter is distorted within the relatively narrow core of the vortex , and the superfluid flows around the core with speed which is inversally proportional to the distance from the vortex core . since both the real and the imaginary parts of the order parameter are zero on the axis of a vortex , vortex lines can be considered as topological defects .",
    "vortices can not terminate in the middle of the flow , so they are either closed loops or extend to the walls .",
    "superfluid turbulence consists of a tangle of quantized vortices . the complex flow field within the tangle acts as a potential barrier for quasiparticles , causing the andreev reflection of a fraction of a beam of thermal excitations incident upon the tangle . the use of andreev scattering as a visualization technique of ultra  low temperature turbulence requires to find out exactly what happens to a single quasiparticle which moves in the velocity field of a vortex , which is what we set out to do",
    "our first aim is to formulate , in the @xmath14-plane , the equations of motion of a single excitation moving in the velocity field of a single straight vortex which we assume to be fixed and aligned along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "we are thus concerned with a two - dimensional problem only .",
    "the quantities ( here and below the numerical values of the quantities are taken at the @xmath16 bar pressure@xcite ) which are necessary to describe the motion of the excitation are the fermi velocity , @xmath17 , the fermi momentum , @xmath18 , and the fermi energy , @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the `` kinetic '' energy of the excitation measured with respect to the fermi energy , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the effective mass of the excitation , and @xmath23 the momentum , @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the magnitude of the superfluid energy gap .",
    "near the vortex axis , at radial distances @xmath26 smaller than the zero  temperature coherence length @xmath27 , the energy gap falls to zero and can be approximated by @xmath28 @xcite . since we are mainly concerned with what happens for @xmath29 , we neglect the spatial dependence of the energy gap and assume the constant value @xmath30 .",
    "using polar coordinates @xmath31 in the @xmath14 plane , the velocity field of a superfluid vortex set along the @xmath32axis is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the quantum of circulation , and @xmath35 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction on the @xmath14-plane .    in the presence of the vortex , the energy of the excitation becomes @xmath36 in writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , the spatial variation of the order parameter is not taken into account for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we also assume that the interaction term @xmath37 varies on a spatial scale which is larger than @xmath38 , and that the excitation can be considered a compact object of momentum @xmath39 , position @xmath40 , and energy @xmath41 .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to use the method developed in ref.@xcite , and consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) as an effective hamiltonian , for which the equations of motion are @xmath42 @xmath43    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hamilton2 ] ) have one immediate integral of motion , the energy : @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton1 ] ) represents the group velocity of the excitation in the velocity field of the vortex .",
    "excitations such that @xmath45 are called quasiparticles , and excitations such that @xmath46 are called quasiholes . the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamilton2 ] ) is thus the force acting on the excitation .",
    "we want to determine the trajectory of an excitation which moves in the two - dimensional velocity field of the vortex .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , and hamilton s equations  ( [ eq : hamilton1 ] ) and ( [ eq : hamilton2 ] ) in polar cordinates @xmath31 .",
    "we notice that the system consisting of a single excitation and a single vortex has a second integral of motion : the component of the angular momentum in the @xmath15-direction , perpendicular to the plane of motion , @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , we can introduce two pairs of canonically conjugated variables , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the radial and azimuthal components of @xmath23 , and @xmath51 is the angular momentum .",
    "since @xmath51 is constant , it is convenient to write it in the form @xmath52 , thereby defining the constant @xmath53 for a particular trajectory . under special initial conditions ,",
    "as we shall see , @xmath53 can be interpreted as the impact parameter .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , ( [ eq : ep ] ) and ( [ eq : hamilton1 ] ) become @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    by setting @xmath58 and using eq .",

    "( [ eq : e - new])-([eq : pr ] ) form a closed set which allows us to determine the trajectory of the excitation .",

    "( [ eq : r - dot ] ) that a quasiparticle incident upon the vortex has @xmath45 and @xmath61 , whereas a quasiparticle moving away from the vortex has @xmath45 and @xmath62 .",
    "versa , a quasihole incident upon the vortex is characterized by @xmath46 and @xmath62 , whereas a quasihole moving away from the vortex has @xmath46 and @xmath61 .",
    "later we shall consider a quasiparticle which leaves a point of the wall of the cylindrical experimental cell ; this quasiparticle is initially characterized by @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the radius of the cell ) , @xmath65 and @xmath61 .",
    "the axis of the vortex will still be at the centre of the coordinate system .",
    "in such case the quasiparticle with initial momentum directed along the @xmath66-axis will feel the effective pairing potential @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq : r - dot ] ) that unless @xmath53 is exactly zero ( @xmath68 ) , the radial velocity of the excitation will eventually vanish .",
    "this may happen either because @xmath69 ( classical turning point ) or because @xmath70 ( andreev turning point ) .",
    "it can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e - new ] ) and ( [ eq : pr ] ) that the classical turning point is reached first when @xmath71 ( here and in the equations below the numerical factor 3 is introduced by the ratio between the effective mass of quasiparticle and the bare mass of a @xmath0he atom : @xmath72 ) in which case a quasiparticle with this energy follows a trajectory which is of the `` normal '' type : the quasiparticle retains its `` particle '' nature and moves past the vortex , across the experimental cell to the wall on the opposite side . on the contrary , a quasiparticle with energy @xmath73 such that @xmath74 reaches the andreev turning point first , undergoes andreev reflection , and returns to a point near its starting point after changing its nature and becoming a quasihole .    of these two cases ,",
    "our concern is the case of andreev reflection .",
    "we first determine the locus of andreev turning points , defined by the minimum radial distance from the vortex core : @xmath75    consider a quasiparticle which has reached @xmath76 . at this point",
    "the radial velocity @xmath77 vanishes , but the excitation does not stop .",
    "it has still a nonzero azimuthal velocity , @xmath78 .",
    "thereafter the excitation propagates as a quasihole ( characterized by a negative value of @xmath79 ) .    in order to calculate the trajectory of a reflected quasiparticle it is convenient to simplify the governing equations of motion using the fact that at the ultra  low temperatures which interest us , @xmath80 , most quasiparticles have energies @xmath81 .",
    "we can then make the following approximation :    @xmath82    this spectrum is similar to landau s spectrum of excitations in superfluid he  ii near the roton minimum ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the effective roton mass ) , which was used to calculate the mutual friction force @xcite ; note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) the role of the roton mass is played by the ratio @xmath86 .",

    "( [ eq : rmin ] ) , the andreev radius depends strongly on the initial energy of the excitation : @xmath108    the same arguments apply to the critical value @xmath109 defined as a maximum value of @xmath53 which causes the andreev reflection of quasiparticles with the given initial energy @xmath79 . to calculate @xmath109",
    ", we assume that at the starting point of the trajectory the quasiparticle has coordinates @xmath110 , where @xmath111 ; the coordinates of the andreev reflection point in this case should be @xmath112 .",

    "in the experimental studies of superfluid turbulence in @xmath0he - b at the ultra - low temperatures the vortex tangle is studied by detecting the fraction of quasiparticles which are andreev reflected by the vortices and measuring the heat which is transported by the quasiparticles . using the results of previous sections , it is straightforward to calculate the fraction of energy ( or heat ) transmitted across the velocity field of a vortex .",
    "once we know this fraction , we shall generalize it to a system of many vortices .    in section iv it was explained that the quasiparticles characterized by the particular impact parameter @xmath53 are andreev reflected by a vortex if their energies satisfy the condition @xmath124 .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , the quasiparticles pass freely across the vortex velocity field .",
    "if the system which consists of the vortex and quasiparticles is in thermal equilibrium , there is no preferred direction around the vortex .",
    "incident and transmitted fluxes at one side of the vortex are canceled by the fluxes in the opposite direction , and no net flow of energy exists when the temperature everywhere around the vortex has the same value .    a net flux of quasiparticles and of energy results only if there is some small temperature difference , @xmath125 between the two sides .",
    "if this is the case , the heat carried by the incident quasiparticles is described by the expression : @xmath126 where @xmath127 here @xmath128 is the density of states at the fermi energy with corresponding fermi momentum @xmath129 .",
