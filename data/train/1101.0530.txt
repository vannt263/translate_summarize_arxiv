    "in  @xcite , the author introduced a system of coordinates for the points of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the starting point of the system is a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane defined by a regular convex polygon  @xmath1 with @xmath2  sides and with interior angle @xmath3 .",
    "this latter expression means that it is possible to exactly cover a neighbourhood of a point  @xmath4 by placing @xmath5  copies of  @xmath1 with @xmath4  as a common vertex , each copy being an image of the initial one by a suitable rotation around  @xmath4 involving a multiple of the above angle . in section  [ tilings ]",
    "we explain how to define coordinates for the tiling defined by  @xmath1 . in section  [ trigrids ] , remembering the construction of  @xcite , we shall define a family of triangular tilings together with a coordinate system for each member of the family . in subsection  [ coordtrigrids ]",
    ", we give an algorithm to compute the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile from the coordinate of this tile .",
    "in order to be as self - contained as possible , we start by reminding in what consists hyperbolic geometry , also introducing a model in which we can see something , this is the goal os sub - section  [ introgeom ] . however , it is the place here to warn the reader that despite the model we can see a very little only .",
    "in fact , we are in the situation of the pilot of a plane with no visibility , when the flight has to be processed with instruments only .    then , in sub - section  [ grids ] , we remind the tessellations of the hyperbolic plane constructed from a regular convex polygon and , in sub - section  [ coord ] we remember the definition of the coordinates for the tiles in these tessellations .",
    "hyperbolic geometry appeared in the first half of the 19@xmath7 century , proving the independence of the parallel axiom of euclidean geometry .",
    "models were devised in the second half of the 19@xmath7 century and we shall use here one of the most popular ones , poincar s disc .",
    "this model is represented by figure  [ poincare_disc ] .    inside the open disc represented in the figure we have the points of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "note that by definition , the points on the border of the disc do not belong to the hyperbolic plane .",
    "however , these points play an important role in this geometry and are called * points at infinity*. lines are trace of diameters or circles orthogonal to the border of the disc , e.g. the line  @xmath8 . in this model ,",
    "two lines which meet in the open disc are called * secant * and two lines which meet at infinity , _",
    "i.e. _ at a point at infinity are called * parallel*. in the figure , we can see a line  @xmath9 through the point  @xmath10 which cuts  @xmath8 .",
    "now , we can see that two lines pass through  @xmath10 which are parallel to  @xmath8 : @xmath2 and  @xmath5 .",
    "they touch  @xmath8 in the model at  @xmath1 and  @xmath11 respectively which are points at infinity . at",
    "last , and not the least : the line  @xmath12 also passes through  @xmath10 without cutting  @xmath8 , neither inside the disc nor outside it .",
    "this line is called * non - secant * with  @xmath8 .      from a famous theorem established by poincar in the late 19@xmath7 century",
    ", it is known that there are infinitely many tilings in the hyperbolic plane , each one generated by the reflection of a regular convex polygon  @xmath1 in its sides and , recursively , by the reflection of the images in their sides , provided that the number  @xmath2 of sides of  @xmath1 and the number  @xmath5 of copies of  @xmath1 which can be put around a point  @xmath10 and exactly covering a neighbourhood of  @xmath10 without overlapping satisfy the relation : .",
    "the numbers @xmath2 and  @xmath5 characterize the tiling which is denoted @xmath6 and the condition says that the considered polygons live in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "we call  @xmath1 the * basic polygon * of the tessellation . note that the three tilings of the euclidean plane which can be defined up to similarities can be characterized by the relation obtained by replacing  @xmath13 with  @xmath14 in the above expression . in this way ,",
    "the basic polynomial of these tessellations are the square for @xmath15 , the equilateral triangle for @xmath16and the regular hexagon for @xmath17 .    in the paper ,",
    "the figures which illustrate the explanations of the text are based on two tilings which are the simplest ones which can be defined in this way in the hyperbolic plane : @xmath18 and  @xmath19 .",
    "we call these tilings the * pentagrid * and the * heptagrid * respectively .",
    "they are illustrated by figures  [ tiling_54 ] and  [ tiling_73 ] .",
    "on the right - hand side of the figure , we can see the tree which is in bijection with an angular sector , a basic structure of the heptagrid , also see figure  [ eclate_73 ] .",
    "this property is not specific to the heptagrid , it is a general property of the tilings @xmath6 .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed analysis and detailed explanations of these tools .",
    "however , here we give a summary of these properties which allow the reader to better understand the further constructions .    the angular sector which we put in bijection with a tree",
    "is defined in a way which depends on the parity of  @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 is even , we fix a copy  @xmath1 of the basic polygon of the tessellation .",
    "we fix a vertex  @xmath4 of  @xmath1 and we consider  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 the two rays issued from  @xmath4 which support the sides of  @xmath1 ending at  @xmath4 . if we turn around  @xmath4 in the counter - clockwise orientation and remaining in  @xmath1 , we can first see  @xmath20 and then  @xmath21 .",
    "the angle defined by  @xmath4 , @xmath20 and  @xmath21 taken in this order in the above mentioned orientation , constitutes an angular sector and we say that @xmath1  is its * leading tile * and that @xmath4  is its * summit*. as proved in  @xcite , the restriction of the tiling to this angular sector is in bijection with a tree , and this tree looks like the one which illustrated by figure  [ tiling_54 ] when @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath5 is odd , we again fix a copy  @xmath1 of the basic polygon to be the central cell .",
    "however , this time we can not take the sides which abut to a vertex in order to define a sector .",
    "the reason is that the line which supports this side cuts another tile along one of its reflection axes and this leads to further complications .",
    "a simpler way is the following one , explained in  @xcite .",
    "it is illustrated by figure  [ vertex ] .",
    "first , we define the type of lines which we shall use to delimit the angular sector .",
    "consider a copy of  @xmath1 and fix a vertex  @xmath4 of  @xmath1 .",
    "we know that exactly @xmath5  sides of copies of  @xmath1 have  @xmath4 as an end .",
    "there is a single one  @xmath23 which is supported by the bisector of the angle defined by the two edges of  @xmath1 which meet at  @xmath4 .",
    "consider the mid - point  @xmath24 of  @xmath23 . consider the edge of a copy of  @xmath1 which makes the angle @xmath25 with  @xmath23 , the angle being measured while turning counter - clockwise around  @xmath4 .",
    "the over end of this edge is  @xmath26 .",
    "next , repeat the construction from  @xmath26 with the just considered edge and considering the edge defined by the angle  @xmath27 with  @xmath28 measured while turning around  @xmath26 clockwise this time .",
    "this defines a new edge whose other end is  @xmath29 .",
    "now , the mid - points @xmath24 , @xmath30 and  @xmath31 of the just considered edges are on a same ray  @xmath32 issued from  @xmath24 .",
    "next , we can endlessly repeat these two steps of construction starting from  @xmath29 .",
    "the line which support this ray is called a and the ray itself is a * @xmath33-mid - point ray*. note that another @xmath33-mid - point ray is issued from  @xmath24 : it is obtained by taking the reflection of  @xmath32 in the line which supports  @xmath23 .",
    "second , we can now define the angular sector as follows .",
    "we fix a copy of  @xmath1 which is the leading tile of the sector .",
    "let @xmath34 and  @xmath35 be the edges of  @xmath1 which meet at  @xmath4 .",
    "we may assume that while counter - clockwise turning around  @xmath4 @xmath35  is met before  @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath36  be the edge which has  @xmath4 as an end and which is supported by the bisector of the angle defined by  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 .",
    "let  @xmath37 and  @xmath38 be the mid - points of  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 respectively .",
    "let  @xmath21 be the @xmath33-mid - point ray issued from  @xmath24 which passes through  @xmath37 .",
    "consider the rotation  @xmath39 around  @xmath4 which transforms  @xmath34 into  @xmath35 : it leaves globally invariant the set of edges meeting at  @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath39  transforms  @xmath24 into  @xmath24 , the mid - point of another edge meeting at  @xmath4 which is on the bisector of the angle defined by  @xmath40 and  @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath33-mid - point ray  @xmath20 issued from  @xmath42 which passes through  @xmath38 is exactly @xmath43 , see figure  [ sect_s0 ] .",
    "the angular sector which we define has its summit at  @xmath4 , its leading tile is  @xmath1 and it is delimited by the @xmath33-mid - point rays  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 .",
    "now , the set of tiles we consider as attached to this angular sector is the set of tiles whose all vertices but possibly at most one are included in the sector , its two rays being included .",
    "we again say that this set of tiles is the restriction of the tiling to the angular sector .",
    "now , in both cases , the whole tiling splits into the central cell and copies of the angular sector dispatched around the central tile .",
    "it is important to note that the tree which is obtained in this case is a bit different from the tree which we obtain in the case when @xmath5  is even .    before turning to the coordinates",
    ", we have to mention two important particular cases : the case when @xmath22 and the case when @xmath44 . in both of them and in these cases only , the tilings @xmath45 and @xmath46+@xmath47 share very particular properties .",
    "the first property is that for each @xmath48 , the tilings @xmath45 and @xmath46+@xmath47 have their angular sector spanned by the same tree .",
    "the second property shared by all tilings @xmath45 and @xmath46+@xmath47 is the following . fix a copy of  @xmath1 , the basic polygon of the tessellation .",
    "we call it the * central tile*. say that @xmath1  belongs to generation  0 .",
    "now , the tiles obtained by reflection of a polygon of the generation  @xmath12 in its sides and which do not belong to a generation  @xmath8 with  @xmath49 are said to belong to the generation  @xmath12 + 1 .",
    "now from each tile of generation  1 , we can define a copy of an angular sector , taking this tile as the leading tile of the sector , in such a way that the sectors and the central tile cover the whole plane without overlapping .",
    "this can be obtained as follows in the case when @xmath22 .",
    "the summit of each sector is a vertex of the central tile  @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath1  be the leading tile of the angular sector .",
    "we place the sector in such a way that the side shared by  @xmath1 and  @xmath38 is supported by the ray  @xmath20 of the sector .",
    "we can see that the continuation of  @xmath21 also supports a side of  @xmath38 , but this side is not contained in the sector : it is contained in another one .",
    "in the case when @xmath44 , the @xmath33-mid - point lines coincide with the * mid - point lines * defined as lines joining mid - points of consecutive edges in a polygon .",
    "then , the angular sector is defined by taking a neighbour  @xmath1 of the central tile as leading tile of the sector .",
    "we chose  @xmath4 a vertex belonging to  @xmath1 and to the central tile in such a way that the ray  @xmath20 passes through the mid - point of the common edge of  @xmath1 and the central tile .    in both cases , it is not difficult to see that we have @xmath5  angular sectors around the central tile and that the sectors and the central cell cover the plane without overlapping , see figure  [ dispatch ] for the pentagrid and the heptagrid .",
    "the levels of the tree which is in bijection with the restriction of the tiling to the sector define levels in the sector , thanks to the bijection .",
    "the leading tile is the root of the tree , whose level is  0 , and it is not difficult to see that the level  @xmath12 + 1 in the sector consists of the restriction , to the sector , of the tiles of the generation  @xmath12 .    -25pt    this correspondence between the generation by reflection in the sides and the levels of the tree is no more true when @xmath50 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , starting from @xmath51 in the case when @xmath5  is even and from @xmath52 in the case when @xmath5  is odd , one level of the tree contains tiles belonging to several generations , but not all of them , so that the correspondence between the levels and the generations is much more complex .",
    "the existence of a tree which is in bijection with the restriction of the tiling to an appropriate angular sector is a key property .",
    "it is the basis of a very efficient navigation tool to locate tiles in these tilings .",
    "this tool is even more efficient in the cases of the pentagrid and of the heptagrid .    in the case",
    "when @xmath5  is even , the coordinates of the tiles are obtained by the greatest positive root of the following polynomial :    where @xmath33  is defined by @xmath53 .",
    "there are two kind of nodes : ordinary ones with nodes and special ones with  nodes . in the case",
    "when @xmath5  is odd the coordinates are obtained from the greatest real root of another polynomial :    where @xmath33  is defined by @xmath53 + 1 .",
    "this time , the number of sons for the ordinary nodes is nodes and among them , we have two nodes with special types , say  0 and  1 , one node in each type .",
    "for the special nodes of type  0 they have sons where one of them is of type  1 and all others are ordinary nodes .",
    "for the special nodes of type  1 they have  nodes with a single node of special type among them , namely the type  1 .    in both cases ,",
    "the greatest real root  @xmath54 of @xmath55 is positive .",
    "in fact it satisfies the following relation : when @xmath5  is even and when @xmath5  is odd , assuming in both cases that @xmath48 and @xmath56 .",
    "now , for the remaining three cases , easy and direct computations show that . from  @xmath55",
    ", we define an induction equation :    for even  @xmath5 with @xmath57 and .",
    "when @xmath5  is odd , we define :    with @xmath57 , @xmath58@xmath0@xmath59@xmath0@xmath60+@xmath61 and @xmath62@xmath0@xmath59@xmath0@xmath63@xmath0@xmath64@xmath0@xmath60 .",
    "now we can notice that if we take @xmath65 , we obtain that :    we have that @xmath66 is the number of nodes of the level  @xmath12 in the tree  @xmath67 in bijection with the restriction of the tiling to the angular sector .",
    "introducing @xmath68 , it is known that any positive natural number  @xmath12 can be represented as a sum of the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is defined by the equation associated to  @xmath55 . in general , the representation is not unique .",
    "however , it can be made unique by requiring the representation which has the greatest number of digits , or in terms of the above formula , where @xmath71  is maximal .",
    "we call this representation the * greedy * representation of  @xmath12 in the basis  @xmath54 . numbering the nodes of  @xmath67 from the root and then level by level and , on each level from the left to the right , we call * coordinate * of a tile  @xmath72 of an angular sector the greedy representation of the number attached to  @xmath72 under the bijection between  @xmath67 and the sector .",
    "now , the central tile has 0  as coordinate and any other tile is in a single sector  @xmath73 with @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75@xmath0@xmath60 .",
    "accordingly , we call * coordinate * of a tile  @xmath72 , either 0 , for the central tile , or @xmath76 where @xmath73  is the number of the sector containing  @xmath72 and @xmath77  is its coordinate in  @xmath67 .    now , the language of the coordinates is regular in all cases but one .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the other roots of  @xmath55 have a modulus less than  1 so that we always have a pisot polynomial , except in the case when @xmath52 and @xmath78 .",
    "now , it is known that the language of the greedy representation of the positive natural numbers in the basis  @xmath54 is regular if and only if @xmath54  is the greatest real root of a pisot polynomial . however , in the exceptional case , we can introduce coordinates using the dual graph of @xmath79 which is the pentagrid : as the pentagrid has a coordinate system with much more convenient properties we can use this system for @xmath79 , see  @xcite for more details .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a detailed study of the properties of the coordinates of the tiles which allows us there to obtain the computation of the neighbours of a tile .",
    "remember that by neighbour of a tile  @xmath72 , we mean a tile which shares a side with  @xmath72 .",
    "we also attach numbers to the sides of a tile  @xmath72 .",
    "assuming that side  1 is fixed , the other sides are obtained in increasing number while counter - clockwise turning around  @xmath72 .",
    "if  @xmath72 is the central tile , side  1 is fixed once and for all .",
    "if  @xmath72 is another tile , side  1 is the side shared with its father , assuming that the father of the leading tile of a sector is the central tile .",
    "this numbering of the sides allows to number the neighbours of a tile  @xmath72 : by definition , the neighbour  @xmath80 of  @xmath72 is the tile which shares with  @xmath72 the side numbered  @xmath80 in  @xmath72 .    for the following sections",
    ", we assume that we have the function @xmath81 at our disposal , which computes the neighbour  @xmath82 of the tile  @xmath72 whose coordinate is @xmath76 . most often , the sector of  @xmath81 is again the sector  @xmath73 .",
    "now , if @xmath77  is the coordinate of a node on an extremal branch of the tree , the sector of  @xmath81 is different : if may be @xmath831 or @xmath841 , where when @xmath85@xmath0@xmath86 $ ] and ; similarly , when @xmath87 $ ] and .",
    "then , when the sector of @xmath81 is not  @xmath73 it is either @xmath831 or @xmath841 .",
    "however , we give in tables  [ coord2 ] and [ coord3 ] the possibility to compute @xmath81 in the case of the heptagrid in terms of two auxiliary functions : @xmath88 , which gives the number of the father of a node belonging to the tree , and @xmath89 which is the number of neighbour  4 in all the cases . as in most cases ,",
    "the sector of @xmath81 is also  @xmath73 , we shall consider only the number of the tree for  @xmath90 , the neighbour  @xmath82 of the node  @xmath77 . in table",
    "[ coord3 ] , we mention the computation of the new sector when the neighbour is outside the sector of the tile .",
    "1=0 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 the computation of these expressions can be found in  @xcite but we repeat them for the self - containedness of the paper .",
    "the computation of  @xmath91 involves the already mentioned auxiliary functions , @xmath88 and  @xmath89 . as mentioned from  @xcite , the tree which we consider has two kinds of nodes : black and white ones with two and three sons respectively .",
    "the sons can be deduced from the node by the following rules and in easy notations , where the star indicates the place of neighbour  4 .",
    "we assume here that the functions @xmath88 and  @xmath89 are known .",
    "their computation is efficient but it requires notions which we have not mentioned here .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for additional information .",
    "clearly , the coordinate of a neighbour  @xmath30 of a tile  @xmath72 with coordinate  @xmath77 depends on the side  @xmath82 shared by  @xmath72 and  @xmath30 .",
    "now , notice that this side numbered by  @xmath82 in  @xmath72 does not receive the same number in  @xmath30 and we shall say that @xmath30  is the neighbour  @xmath82 of  @xmath72 .",
    "the correspondence between these numbers gives the value of the function @xmath92 and , for completeness , we give it in table  [ coord2 ] .",
    "note that the sides of the central cell are all numbered by  1 in its neighbours .",
    "for the other cells , the correspondence depends on the status of  @xmath72 and it may also depend on that of  @xmath30 .",
    "side  7 is always the side shared by a neighbour which is on the same level of the tree , even when there is a change of tree by the change of sector .",
    "if  @xmath72 is black , its side  7 is numbered  2 on the other side .",
    "if  @xmath72 is white , the number of its side  7 in the other neighbour  @xmath30 depends on the status of  @xmath30 as indicated in the table .",
    "# 1 # 2 # 3 # 4    # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 6 # 7 # 8 from this table , we can indicate the values of @xmath91 which are given in table  [ coord3 ] .",
    "the basic point is that @xmath93 for the heptagon  @xmath94 defined by  @xmath77 is always @xmath88 , as its neighbour  1 is the father of  @xmath94 .",
    "similarly , we have that @xmath95 is always @xmath89 by definition , regardless of the status of  @xmath94 .",
    "note that in the case of a black heptagon  @xmath94 on the leftmost branch of the tree , two of its neighbours belong to the other tree on this side of the sector of  @xmath94 : neighbours  2 and  3 .",
    "neighbour  2 is still and , consequently , neighbour  3 is the rightmost son of neighbour  2 , hence it is .",
    "a symmetrical remark holds for a white  @xmath94 standing on the rightmost branch of the tree : neighbours  6 and  7 belong to another tree , the one which spans the other sector than that of  @xmath94 .",
    "now , this time , neighbour  6 is numbered and so , as neighbour  7 is the father of neighbour  6 , neighbour  7 is numbered . at last",
    ", the root , which is a white node , belongs to both the left- and the rightmost branches of the tree .",
    "this is why it has a specific profile , different from both a standard white node and from a node on the rightmost branch of the tree .",
    "it remains to indicate that in the case of a heptagon  @xmath94 which is on the left- or the rightmost branch , it is easy to define the number of the sector to which belongs the neighbours which do not belong to the tree of  @xmath94 .",
    "the new number is @xmath96 for neighbours  2 and  3 of a tile which is on the leftmost branch of the tree , it is @xmath97 for neighbours  6 and  7 of a tile which is on the rightmost branch , see table  [ coord3 ] .",
    "now , we can define the new family of tilings constructed upon the tilings @xmath6 .",
    "this is the goal of subsection  [ deftrigrids ] .",
    "then , in subsection  [ coordtrigrids ] , we construct coordinates for the tiles of the tilings which we define in subsection  [ deftrigrids ] .      in  @xcite , the author gives a system of coordinates for the points of the hyperbolic plane based on the heptagrid .",
    "the idea , illustrated by figure  [ eclate_73 ] , is to iterate a simple construction . in the first step ,",
    "we split each heptagon  @xmath94 in seven equal triangles , each one based on an edge of  @xmath94 and having its summit at the centre of  @xmath94 .",
    "this first step of the process defines * 1-triangles*. now , considering that the * @xmath12-triangles * have been defined , for each @xmath12-triangle  @xmath72 , we obtain four @xmath12 + 1-triangles as follows : three of these triangles are defined by a vertex  @xmath4 of  @xmath72 and by the mid - points of the two edges of  @xmath72 which meet at  @xmath4 ; the fourth @xmath12 + 1-triangle is defined by the mid - points of the edges of  @xmath72 . in figure",
    "[ eclate_73 ] , we can see the 1-triangles and the 2-triangles obtained from a heptagon .",
    "we can describe this process more precisely and generalize it as follows .",
    "we fix a tiling  @xmath6 of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "accordingly , each tile has a coordinate @xmath76 , with @xmath73 the number of the sector where the tile lies and @xmath77 its coordinate in the sector , the coordinate being  0 for the central tile .",
    "each polygon  @xmath1 defines @xmath2  1-triangles , each one being numbered from  1 up to  @xmath2 .",
    "the 1-triangle  @xmath80 has the side  @xmath80 of  @xmath1 as its basis and the centre of  @xmath1 as the vertex , opposite to the basis . in each triangle",
    ", we number the vertices from  0 to  2 with 2  being given to the centre of  @xmath1 and  0 with  1 associated to the ends of the side  @xmath80 .",
    "we fix the positions of  0 and  1 in such a way that 0,1 and  2 are obtained by counter - clockwise turning around the 1-triangle .",
    "once the numbering of the vertices are fixed , we use the same numbers to number the edges and the mid - points of the edges . by convention ,",
    "the edge  @xmath80 is opposite to the vertex  @xmath80 and the mid - point of the edge  @xmath80 is also called  @xmath80 .",
    "once the @xmath12-triangles are defined with the numbering of their vertices , their edges and the mid - points of their edges are fixed , we can define the @xmath12 + 1-triangles as follows .",
    "consider an @xmath12-triangle  @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath98 is a vertex of  @xmath72 , then the edges meeting at  @xmath98 are numbered @xmath54 and  @xmath99 with .",
    "it is the same for the mid - points of these edges and so , the vertex  @xmath98 and the mid - points @xmath54 and  @xmath99 define an @xmath12 + 1-triangle .",
    "again by definition , the mid - points of the edges of  @xmath72 also define an @xmath12 + 1-triangle .",
    "now , as the vertices of each @xmath12 + 1-triangle has received    a number in @xmath100 $ ] in such a way that we have 0,1 , 2 or 0,2,1 while counter - clockwise turning around the @xmath12 + 1-triangle , the edges and the mid - points of each @xmath12 + 1-triangle can also be numbered by applying the same rules as those applied for numbering the respective elements of the @xmath12-triangles . at last , let @xmath72 be an @xmath12 + 1-triangle  @xmath72 and let  @xmath101 be the single @xmath12-triangle which contains  @xmath72 . if @xmath72  has as a vertex the vertex  @xmath98 of  @xmath101 , @xmath72  is numbered  @xmath98 .",
    "if all the vertices of  @xmath72 are the mid - points of the edges of  @xmath101 , then @xmath72 is numbered with  3 .",
    "accordingly , this process can be repeated endlessly as it was completed for the 1-triangles .",
    "we can notice that if the numbering of an @xmath12-triangle  @xmath72 is while counter - clockwise turning around  @xmath72 , the numbering of the @xmath12 + 1-triangles inside  @xmath72 numbered 0 , 1 and  2 has the opposite orientation , while the numbering of the @xmath12 + 1-triangle  3 has the same orientation .    for each @xmath12 ,",
    "the set of @xmath12-triangles constitutes a triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane which we call the * @xmath12-trigrid * based on the tiling @xmath6 .",
    "as already mentioned in the captions , the trigrids based on the heptagrid are called * heptatrigrids*.      now , we have all the elements which allow us to define coordinates for the tiles of the trigrids .",
    "consider an @xmath12 + 1-triangle  @xmath72 , with @xmath102 .",
    "there is a unique sequence of  @xmath12 + 1 @xmath8-triangles @xmath103 with @xmath49 , @xmath104 for @xmath105 $ ] , with @xmath106 and each @xmath103 being an @xmath80-triangle .",
    "let @xmath107 $ ]  be the number of  @xmath103 .",
    "then the coordinate of  @xmath72 is the sequence @xmath108, .. ,[\\alpha_{n+1}])$ ] .",
    "we remark that @xmath109\\in[1 .. p]$ ] and that @xmath110\\in[0 .. 3]$ ] for @xmath111+@xmath86 $ ] .    in  @xcite the author defined coordinates of the points of the hyperbolic plane starting from the heptagrid by considering , for each point , a sequence of @xmath12-triangles converging to the point .",
    "the numbers of the @xmath12-triangles which are defined in  @xcite exactly in the same way as they are defined in subsection  [ deftrigrids ] are used as digits for the representation of the point .",
    "there are two big differences with the situation we consider in this paper : in  @xcite , the coordinate of a point is an infinite sequence while here , it is a finite one ; the second difference is that a point has infinitely many possible coordinates while here , an @xmath12-triangle has a unique coordinate .    in this sub - section",
    ", we shall see how to compute the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile .",
    "consider an @xmath12 + 1-triangle  @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath112  be the @xmath12-triangle which contains  @xmath72 .",
    "we shall see that if we know the coordinates of the neighbours of  @xmath112 , we can easily compute the coordinates of the neighbours of  @xmath72",
    ".    the reason will be clear from the following study .    if  [ 3 ] is the number of  @xmath72 , all its neighbours are in  @xmath112 . in the other cases ,",
    "one neighbour is in  @xmath112 while the others are not , but , as can easily be seen , they are necessarily in a neighbour of  @xmath112 .",
    "we denote the neighbours of an @xmath12-triangle in a way which similar to what we did for a polygon . here , the neighbours  1 , 2 and  3 of an @xmath12-triangle  @xmath113 are the @xmath12-triangles which share with  @xmath113 the side  0 , 1 and  2 respectively . the exact correspondence for the neighbours of  @xmath72 is given by the following table in which @xmath114 , @xmath4 and  @xmath26 are the neighbours  1 , 2 and  3 respectively of  @xmath112 .",
    "also , we denote by @xmath13@xmath113@xmath115 the coordinate of the @xmath12-triangle  @xmath113 and the @xmath12 + 1-triangles contained in  @xmath113 have @xmath13@xmath113@xmath115.[0 ] , @xmath13@xmath113@xmath115.[1 ] , @xmath13@xmath113@xmath115.[2 ] and @xmath13@xmath113@xmath115.[3 ] as coordinates , where . denotes the concatenation which transforms a sequence with  @xmath71 terms into a sequence with  @xmath71 + 1 terms .",
    "# 1 # 2 # 3 # 4    from this table , we can easily devise an algorithm which computes the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile  @xmath72 .",
    "the idea is simple : we start with computing the neighbours @xmath116 , @xmath117 and  @xmath118 of the 1-triangle  @xmath119 which contains  @xmath72 .",
    "we know that @xmath116 and  @xmath117 belong to the same polygon  @xmath1 as  @xmath119 , they are simply based on another side of  @xmath120 .",
    "more precisely , if  @xmath82 is the number of the side on which @xmath119  is based , then @xmath116  is based on the side  @xmath121 and @xmath117  is based on the side  @xmath122 .",
    "now , @xmath118 belongs to a polygon  @xmath11 which is the neighbour  @xmath82 of  @xmath1 and the number in  @xmath11 of the side which it shares with  @xmath1 is given by a table similar to table  [ coord2 ] which can be used in the case of a heptatrigrid .",
    "next , we go from the neighbours @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 of  @xmath126 , where @xmath126 is the @xmath8-triangle which contains  @xmath72 , to those , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 of  @xmath130 thanks to table  [ coordneigh ] .",
    "the exact writing of this algorithm in a pseudo - code or in a programming language is left to the reader .",
    "now , we can notice that each step of the considered algorithm is constant in term of resources and in term of what is appended to the already known resources .",
    "accordingly , this algorithm is linear .",
    "now , it was proved in  @xcite that the computation of the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile in a tiling @xmath6 is linear in the size of the coordinate of the tile itself .",
    "accordingly , this proves the following result :    [ coordlin ] for each @xmath2 and @xmath5 such that the tiling @xmath6 is a tiling of the hyperbolic plane , there is an algorithm which computes the coordinates of the neighbours of an @xmath12-triangle  @xmath72 in linear time with respect to the size of the coordinate of  @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this algorithm allows us to compute the size of the coordinates of a tile for each @xmath12-trigrid , independently of  @xmath12 .",
    "note that , in any case , the size of  @xmath12 is contained in unary in the size of the coordinate as the number of numbers of @xmath8-triangles involved in the coordinates is @xmath12@xmath01 .",
    "but , of course , there is an algorithm for each @xmath2 and  @xmath5 .",
    "with theorem  [ coordlin ] , we have an algorithm which allows us to efficiently compute the coordinates of the neighbours of a tile in any @xmath12-trigrid of a given tiling  @xmath6 .",
    "this allows us to implement cellular automata in such tilings .",
    "in particular , this holds in the heptatrigrid .",
    "it might be objected that the resulting cellular automaton has not a uniform structure .",
    "this is not completely true .",
    "first of all , each triangle has three neighbours so that , as long as the neighbours are defined by the condition of sharing a side with the tile , the uniformity on the number of neighbours is preserved .",
    "what is here different is that the number of tiles around a vertex is not always the same .",
    "it is  6 in the majority of cases but it is  @xmath2 in the others : in fact , when an @xmath8-triangle has the centre  @xmath38 of a polygon as a vertex , there are @xmath2 @xmath8-triangles around  @xmath38 , regardless of  @xmath8 .",
    "but , this occurrence of vertices around which there is a number of sides which is different of  6 is also regular as the tiling @xmath6 itself is regular , being defined by the tessellation of a regular polygon ."
