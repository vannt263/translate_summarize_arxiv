    "the conversion between bipartite or multipartite quantum states through local operations is a central concept of entanglement theory .",
    "for instance , it is the criterion used to classify entanglement , namely , two states have equivalent entanglement if they can be converted to each other  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is usual and natural to consider a state more entangled than other when the first can _ access _ the former by the allowed transformations @xcite . two important sets of allowed transformations are the deterministic _ local operations and classical communication _ ( locc ) and its stochastic version ( slocc ) , where the transformation only needs to succeed with positive probability @xcite .",
    "although this hierarchisation is relatively simple for bipartite pure states  @xcite , it is quite involved if mixed or multipartite states are considered  @xcite .",
    "the problem of convertibility of bipartite pure states has been solved by nielsen@xcite , using the concept of majorisation @xcite .",
    "however , jonathan and plenio discovered a surprising effect @xcite . they have shown the existence of pairs of states which are not directly inter - convertible but such that their conversion is possible if another ( necessarily entangled ) state is attached to them .",
    "that is , the pair of states have incomparable entanglement but they may become ordered if an extra system is attached to the original ones . such extra state that makes a transformation possible , without being consumed ,",
    "is called a _",
    "catalyst_. more recently , the problem of convertibility has received experimental attention @xcite and has also been connected to basic results in thermodynamics @xcite and phase transitions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the following question : can one of the states of a non inter - convertible pair be used as a catalyst ?",
    "we answer this question positively , providing explicit examples .",
    "we also explore how common such processes are for low dimensional systems .",
    "an interesting situation is when a state @xmath0 is not able of self - catalysing a transformation , but a number of copies , @xmath1 , is .",
    "we exhibit examples where more than one copy is required and study how augmenting the number of copies can increase the probability of conversion .",
    "in section  [ catalisys ] we review basic notions of state conversion and catalysis under locc . in section  [ selfie ]",
    "we show explicit examples of self - catalytic processes , explore , through numerical analysis , how frequent they are under random samples of incomparable pairs and how it depends on the size of the systems .",
    "section  [ catslocc ] review the notions of probabilistic catalysis under slocc , while the natural questions of self - catalysis under slocc are discussed in section  [ sefslocc ] .",
    "we close the main text with final remarks and further problems in section  [ concl ] .",
    "we say that a bipartite state @xmath2 _ access _ a state @xmath3 , if there is some locc operation , represented by a completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are finite dimensional hilbert spaces and @xmath4 maps density operators acting on @xmath8 to density operators acting on @xmath9 . in such case , we write @xmath10 . if there is no locc operation able to convert @xmath11 to @xmath12 , we shall write @xmath13 .    for example , for a pair of qubits , the bell state @xmath14 can access any two - qubit pure state .",
    "indeed , naming our qubits @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and writing the target state as @xmath17 , we can , for example , make @xmath15 unitarily interact with an auxiliary qubit @xmath18 , so that @xmath19 and @xmath20 . then , @xmath21{\\left| 0_{a ' } \\right\\rangle}\\mapsto ( 1/\\sqrt{2})(a{\\left| 0_{a}0_{b } \\right\\rangle}+b{\\left| 1_{a}1_{b } \\right\\rangle}){\\left| 0_{a ' } \\right\\rangle}+(1/\\sqrt{2})(a{\\left| 0_{a}1_{b } \\right\\rangle}+b{\\left|   1_{a}0_{b } \\right\\rangle } ) { \\left|   1_{a ' }   \\right\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "the lab with qubit @xmath15 can make a measurement on the computational basis of the auxiliary @xmath18 and send the result to the lab holding qubit @xmath16 .",
    "if the result is @xmath22 , they already share the desired state , while the result being @xmath23 , a not operation , @xmath24 , can be applied to qubit @xmath16 to also leave the system @xmath25 in the desired state .",
    "this result generalises for a pair of qu@xmath26its in the state @xmath27 , which justifies @xmath28 to be called a maximally entangled state .",
    "nielsen , in the seminal paper  @xcite , provided a simple necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether a general bipartite state @xmath11 can access a state @xmath12 in terms of their corresponding schmidt vectors  @xcite :    [ thm - nielsen ] if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ( non - increasing ) ordered schmidt vectors of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , we have @xmath31 if , and only if , @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    by an ordered schmidt vector @xmath34 , we mean that @xmath35 . in this work",
    ", we shall always assume that schmidt vectors are ordered .",
    "when vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 satisfy conditions   we say that @xmath36 is majorised by @xmath37 and write @xmath38 .",
    "revisiting the example above , we have @xmath39 for the ordered schmidt vector of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , assuming @xmath43 , it is straightforward to apply the criterion and verify that @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "a consequence of the criterion is the existence of pair of states @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 . actually , the only case where such an order is total is for two qubits .",
    "for instance , consider a state of two four - level systems with schmidt vector @xmath47 and a two - qutrit state with schmidt vector @xmath48 . indeed ,    @xmath49    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors surprisingly show that it is possible to circumvent such non - accessibility between these states by making the parts to share an entangled state @xmath50 such that @xmath51 ( see figure  [ cris1 ] ) .",
    "since the state @xmath50 allows for a previously forbidden conversion , but at the end of the process it remains unaltered , it is called a _ catalyst_. in this sense , we say that @xmath11 _",
    "@xmath12 when @xmath53 , but @xmath54 . in this specific example , the two - qubit state @xmath50 with schmidt vector @xmath55 is a catalyst .",
    "is not allowed under locc , the state @xmath50 can be used ( but not consumed ) to make it viable . ]",
    "nielsen s criterion ensures that all information about the ( possibility of ) conversion is contained in the schmidt vectors .",
    "therefore , we can explore our knowledge regarding probability vectors to provide more examples of catalysts .",
    "if @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , we obtain :    @xmath60    this is a good example of non - unicity of catalysts . indeed , for a given forbidden transition , @xmath61 , and fixed local dimensions for the catalysts , the set of allowed vectors @xmath52 is a polytope  @xcite .",
    "another interesting geometric fact is that catalysis is possible for every bipartite scenario , starting from @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for all effective dimensions @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 it is possible to choose @xmath66 with catalyst @xmath52 .",
    "the essential step , after the previously described examples , is that given @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath52 , we generically can increase dimensions by one and construct a forbidden transition @xmath67 with the same catalyst @xmath52 , by using @xmath68 and @xmath69 with small enough @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this allow us to construct examples for all such @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we address the main question of this paper for the case of locc convertibility : can a bipartite quantum state be itself the catalyst of a forbidden conversion ? to be more precise , is there a forbidden conversion @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 ? refining a little bit more ,",
    "is it possible that we still have @xmath76 , but a larger number of copies of @xmath11 would do the job , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 for some @xmath78 ?    in table  [ table ] we list examples to answer affirmatively these questions .",
    "the first is an example of self - catalysis from a two - ququart state to a two - qutrit state .",
    "then , for the same scenario , there is a list of multi - copy self - catalysis , with the corresponding minimal number of copies . at the last row",
    ", we come back to single - copy self - catalysis from a two - ququart state to another two - ququart state .    _",
    "remark_. when @xmath11 has 4 non - zero schmidt coefficients and @xmath12 has 3 non - zero schmidt coefficients , the phenomenon of self - catalysis can be noted , that is , even in the minimal dimensions to occur catalysis ( see @xcite ) the self - catalysis can also carry out . geometrically , this mean that even is the smallest dimension ( most restrictive ) case , there are cases where the source state @xmath36 belongs to the polytope of catalysts for the reaction @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to construct examples for any scenario through a similar argument presented at the section  [ catalisys ] .",
    ".[table]number @xmath80 of copies required to make @xmath81 a deterministic catalyst for the process @xmath10 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a particular case of theorem  [ theorem_feng ] allows us to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for having probabilistic self - catalysis for a single copy : * criterion * _ let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be two @xmath73dimensional schmidt vectors with @xmath82 and @xmath83 the vector @xmath36 serves as a probabilistic self - catalyst for the transformation from @xmath11 to @xmath12 if , and only if , for all @xmath84 satisfying @xmath85 , there exist @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 , such that @xmath89 whenever one of the inequalities   or   has an index @xmath90 , it is considered to be violated , so the other one must necessarily be satisfied . _",
    "again , we observe that typically @xmath91 has only one element @xmath92 , since the minimum which determines the probability of conversion is non - degenerate with probability @xmath23 .",
    "[ remark3 ]      the criterion above , together with proposition  [ boundlemma ] and the behaviour of @xmath91 , have interesting consequences for the probability of occurrence of self - catalysis .    from remark  [ remark2 ] , we know that the event @xmath93 $ ] has probability @xmath94 . conditioning on this event we can then analyze the validity of ineqs .   and . with probability @xmath23",
    "we must have @xmath95 , for some @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , we can choose the indexes @xmath97 in only two ways : either @xmath98 or @xmath99 and @xmath100 , for some @xmath87 .",
    "for the second case , one can always satisfy one of the inequalities using the index @xmath90 .",
    "for the first case , the r.h.s of the inequalities always have index @xmath92 and we can lower bound the probability for at least one of inequalities to be valid : @xmath101\\geq \\mathbb{p}[\\max_{1<j\\leq n}\\{\\frac{\\alpha_{j-1}}{\\alpha_{j}}\\}>\\max_{1<j\\leq n}\\{\\frac{\\beta_{j-1}}{\\beta_{j}}\\}]=1/2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using that @xmath102 , since @xmath36 is ordered , and the fact that the two random variables on the second term are independent and identically distributed . putting these",

    "each symbol represents an average over a new set of randomly ( haar ) chosen pairs .",
    "there are three symbols for each explored dimension . ]",
    "we have also numerically investigated the typicality of probabilistic self - catalysis by 1 ) sorting a pair of incomparable schmidt vectors of same fixed dimension ; 2 ) counting how many of them show the effect ; and 3 ) computing the average gain in probability . to be more specific ,",
    "we consider as a success case the situation where the pairs are such that @xmath104 and we compute the average value of @xmath105 . in order to avoid counting cases where @xmath106 due to numerical fluctuations",

    "the results are shown in figures  [ cris3haar ] and [ cris4haar ] .",
    "$ ] , as a function of the size of schmidt vectors ( sampled following haar measure ) , considered only those pairs where self - catalysis occurs , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath108 . ]    first note that they are consisted with the lower bound of @xmath109 estimated before . comparing with the deterministic case ,",
    "probabilistic self - catalysis is much more frequent , as expected .",
    "even more , here we _ do not _ have the same qualitative behaviour : the probability of having a pair of incomparable states exhibiting self - catalysis increases monotonically with the size of the schmidt vectors and seems to be converging to a value around @xmath110 .",
    "meanwhile , this is not the behaviour of the average probability gain , shown in figure  [ cris4haar ] .",
    "the average gain in probability is relatively small for all system sizes , and decreases even more for larger sizes . but note that we consider only one copy of @xmath11 attached , and while for many copies the average gain must be larger .",
    "it is important to recall fig .",
    "[ fig : convratehaar ] , however , which tell us that a pair @xmath111 has , on average , a probability of direct conversion close to @xmath110 , which naturally bounds the catalytic gain to about @xmath112 .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : dpagainstphaar ] represents , for randomly chosen pairs of incomparable schmidt vectors with size @xmath113 , the self - catalytic probability gain _ versus _ direct conversion rates .",
    "the diagonal straight line just represents saturation of probability .",
    "some concentration close to the horizontal axis is natural , representing the cases where self - catalysis does not happen .",
    "however it is not clear why there is the bold concentrated cloud in red , where the majority of the pairs fit .",
    "it empirically means that the most typical situation for a pair of schmidt vectors of the same size is to have a large probability of conversion and to have a considerable ( but not maximal ) self - catalytical gain .    .",
    "the colour represents the number of pairs per pixel . ]",
    "in this paper we have shown the possibility of self - catalytic entanglement conversion for both locc and slocc scenarios by providing explicit examples of them .",
    "we have explored numerically and by arguments of typicality how frequent they are by showing that it is much more common in slocc case than the deterministic one , but despite the fact that self - catalysis under slocc become more common as the systems sizes increase , the direct self - catalysis decreases with the dimension .",
    "moreover , we also investigated how the phenomenon may depend on the number of copies used as catalyst , finding examples of different behaviours , running from cases where there is no gain in considering multiple copies , to cases where the conversion becomes deterministic for a finite number of copies .",
    "since we rest on numerical techniques , we could not guarantee the existence of a transition where the probability of conversion asymptotically goes to @xmath23 . finally , we computed the average gain in probability in the slocc case , showing that this gain , as in the locc case , has a global maximum , and also decreases with larger systems sizes .    in answering the question about existence of self - catalysis",
    ", we obtained many results , not only on deterministic and probabilistic self - catalysis , but also on ordinary catalysis .",
    "about the typicality of self - catalysis , our data support two conjectures : under locc , the probability of finding a self - catalytic reaction increases monotonically attaining a global maximum for a dimension about @xmath114 .",
    "we believe that the origin of this overall non - monotonic behaviour is due the competition between the _ sizes _ of each schmidt vectors and the measure _ concentration _ phenomenon . on the other hand ,",
    "the data suggests that under slocc the probability of finding a self - catalytic reaction increases monotonically with the dimension .    in a sense , we estimated numerically the volumes of the sets of pairs of schmidt vectors where the phenomena take place , but it was not possible to characterize completely the asymptotic behavior with the vectors sizes .",
    "in fact , some of our numerical results have a reasonable dependence on the way we sort the random schmidt vectors .",
    "that is something to be explored elsewhere .",
    "perhaps a better understanding of the geometry of the sets involved could help in that analysis .",
