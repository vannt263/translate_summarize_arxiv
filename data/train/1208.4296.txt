    "the highly mismatched semiconductor alloy gabi@xmath11as@xmath1 , comprised of dilute concentrations of bismuth ( bi ) incorporated in gaas , is an attractive candidate for the design of highly efficient mid- and far - infrared optical @xcite and spintronic @xcite devices .",
    "it has been shown , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , that isovalent substitution of a small fraction of bi atoms in gaas strongly reduces the band gap energy ( e@xmath12 ) by @xmath1390 mev/% bi replacing as .",
    "a giant bowing of the spin - orbit - splitting energy ( @xmath3 ) has also been observed in gabi@xmath11as@xmath1 , leading to the onset of an e@xmath4 regime .",
    "this characteristic is of fundamental importance as it opens the possibility to suppress the dominant chsh auger recombination losses suffered by conventional iii - v telecomm lasers operating at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an understanding of the electronic structure of gabi@xmath0as@xmath1 is crucial both from a fundamental perspective , as well as for potential device applications .",
    "co - alloying of bi and n in gaas further opens up the possibility of precise strain control in gabi@xmath0n@xmath6as@xmath7 thereby offering a large and flexible parameter space for band structure engineering . this work analyses the combined impact of bi and of n on the electronic structure of gabi@xmath0n@xmath6as@xmath7 , showing that n predominantly affects the conduction band and bi the valence band , with both effects largely being independent of each other . a detailed chart of the variations in the e@xmath2 and e@xmath12-@xmath3 energies as a function of bi and n composition is plotted as a guide for material and device design and analysis .",
    "we have developed a nearest neighbor sp@xmath8s@xmath9 tight binding ( tb ) hamiltonian to investigate the electronic structure of the dilute bismide and the bismide - nitride alloys of gaas , including the effects of atomic relaxation determined using a valence force field model  @xcite . by performing large , ordered gabi@xmath0y@xmath1 ( y = as , p ) supercell calculations using our models , we demonstrate that isovalent bi substitution introduces bi - related defect states which interact with the host gay ( y = as , p ) matrix valence band edge via a bi composition dependent band anti - crossing ( bac ) interaction .",
    "the band anti - crossing parameters are then introduced into 12- and 14-band * * k**@xmath10*p * models for gabi@xmath0as@xmath1 and for gabi@xmath11n@xmath14as@xmath7 to investigate the alloy electronic structure .",
    "the details of the derivation procedures are reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) compare band dispersions computed from the tight binding ( tb ) and the * * k**@xmath10*p * models in the vicinity of the @xmath15-point for ga@xmath16as@xmath16 , ga@xmath16bi@xmath17as@xmath18 , and ga@xmath16bi@xmath17n@xmath17as@xmath19 alloy supercells .",
    "the good agreement between the tb and * * k**@xmath10*p * models confirms the presence of the band anti - crossing interaction between the impurity states and the host matrix states .",
    "furthermore , by carrying out 4096-atom ordered supercell calculations , we verify that the effects of bi and of n on the alloy electronic structure are largely independent of each other , with n - related defect states introducing a bac interaction in the conduction band and the bi - related impurity states introducing bac interactions in the valence band .",
    "our calculations show that the observed strong variation in e@xmath12 for gabi@xmath0as@xmath1 can be well explained in terms of a large upward shift in the valence band edge energy due to the bac interaction and a significant contribution coming from a conventional alloy reduction in the conduction band edge energy @xcite .",
    "the large band gap reduction with n composition in ganas is further enhanced by the presence of bi in gabi@xmath0n@xmath6as@xmath7 , leading to a giant e@xmath12 bowing @xcite . since n only weakly perturbs the gaas valence band structure , the bowing of @xmath3 in gabi@xmath0n@xmath6as@xmath7 is similar to that in the gabi@xmath0as@xmath1 alloy .",
    "figure 1 ( d ) shows the variation of e@xmath12 ( red lines ) and of e@xmath12-@xmath3 ( blue lines ) for gabi@xmath0n@xmath6as@xmath7 grown pseudomorphically on gaas with @xmath20% and @xmath21% , for which the layers can be under compressive strain ( @xmath22 ) , strain - free ( @xmath23 ) , or under tensile strain ( @xmath24 ) as the composition is varied .",
    "a large tuning of the band gap wavelength ( @xmath25 ) is demonstrated , to @xmath26 3.0 @xmath27 m .",
    "the e@xmath12-@xmath3 = 0 line indicates the cut - off bi and n compositions beyond which an e@xmath12 energy lower than the @xmath3 energy can be achieved , which is key to the suppression of the chsh auger loss mechanism  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our models provide a clear understanding of the electronic structure of gabi@xmath0as@xmath1 and of gabi@xmath0n@xmath6as@xmath7 .",
    "we conclude that these alloys have significant potential for use in highly efficient optoelectronic devices operating with reduced temperature sensitivity both at telecommunication wavelengths and in the mid - ir , critical to the development of future green commercial telecommunication networks and for a wide range of sensing applications .",
