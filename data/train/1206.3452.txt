    "this paper suggests that the origin of strong interaction symmetries may be found in functions that are automorphic with respect to a group generated by a fractional linear transformation .",
    "examples of automorphic functions are the circular functions which are automorphic with respect to @xmath4 , and elliptic functions which are periodic with respect to a group generated by two translations .",
    "elliptic functions live on tilings that are parallelograms which fill up the entire plane . by cutting and pasting",
    ", the tessellations can be made into a torus of genus @xmath5 .",
    "poincar and klein were interested in looking for automorphic functions of higher genus ; that is , complex - valued functions invariant under specific groups .",
    "klein had already examples in the shape of regular solids , of which there are only a finite number .",
    "we will show that , for real angular momenta , the partial wave amplitude is such an automorphic function corresponding to the dihedral group . according to khuri  @xcite and jones  @xcite , the partial wave amplitude derives its form from the asymptotic large angular momentum limit of the legendre function of the second kind which has three singular points .",
    "these singular points are homologues of vertices of triangles in a conformal mapping , and the group we will be dealing with is the triangular group .    in the unphysical region",
    "the angular momentum becomes complex , and , consequently , the vertex angles of the triangles in the division of the sphere , which would otherwise have the form of a double pyramid , also become complex.the real part corresponds to a rotation , while the imaginary part represents a stretching .",
    "what were indifferent fixed points of an elliptic transformation below threshold , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , become source - sink fixed points , @xmath8 , of a loxodromic transformation above threshold .",
    "what mathematically can be obtained by conjugation has a completely different physical explanation : the transition from the physical , @xmath9 , to the unphysical , @xmath10 , region as the system passes through the threshold .",
    "this can also be viewed as a transformation from the discrete , elementary group of type @xmath5 , consisting of elliptic elements whose group is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath11 , to a discrete , elementary group of type @xmath12 , with loxodromic elements that leave invariant the fixed points @xmath13 . in this way , it may be feasible to study the strong interaction symmetries through the tessellations of the hyperbolic plane , @xmath14 , and ball , @xmath15 , that poincar used to study the symmetries of _ kleinian _ groups , or discrete groups of mbius transformations with complex coefficients .",
    "it is well - known that the scattering amplitude can be cast into what is now known as the watson ",
    "sommerfeld representation  @xcite , @xmath16 although its history goes back much further to poincar , who used it to study the bending of electromagnetic waves by a sphere  @xcite .",
    "the poles occur at integer values of the angular momentum , @xmath17 , and the residue is written as the product of the legendre function of the first kind , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which contains all the angular dependencies , and a factor @xmath20 , which is a function of the linear momentum , @xmath21 .",

    "unwittingly , khuri and jones transformed the partial wave scattering amplitude into an automorphic function .",

    "the schwarzian clearly shows that @xmath46 has three singular points at @xmath47 , which are homologues of the vertices of a triangle in the @xmath43-plane . since the sum of angles , @xmath48\\pi>\\pi,\\ ] ] the triangles are spherical , and there is no _ real _ orthogonal disc which encloses the triangular tessellations .",
