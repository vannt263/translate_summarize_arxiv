    "the observation of a peak in the @xmath7 invariant mass for the @xmath8 reaction on a @xmath9 target at spring8/osaka @xcite raised great hopes that for the first time a strangeness s=1 narrow exotic baryon could be found .",
    "the peak was thus associated to a pentaquark , since the standard @xmath10 states can not produce s=1 .",
    "subsequently , many experiments were done , some which reproduced this peak and others which did not , and the issue stimulated a large number of theoretical works that gave a huge impetus to the field of hadron structure ( see the extensive list of references , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "waters calmed down , a thorough experimental review was written in @xcite and a period of rest followed till a new experimental analysis was done at leps confirming the original peak , now on a deuteron target and with more statistics @xcite . although one can not rule out an interpretation of the peak as a consequence of the particular set up of leps , no alternative conventional explanation for this peak has been provided .",
    "on the theoretical side most of the works concentrated on finding possible states of five quarks ( pentaquark ) . from the perspective of the meson - baryon interaction the situation does not look encouraging , since the @xmath11 interaction obtained from chiral lagrangians is basically repulsive in nature @xcite , and one does not expect to find a narrow ( long lived ) resonance , as the one claimed in @xcite , in this system .",
    "this is why very early there were suggestions that if the peak represented a new state it could be a bound state of three hadrons , @xmath12 , with the pion acting as a glue between the nucleon and the @xmath13 , which would only be bound by about 30 mev .",
    "however , investigations along this line , weakly concluded the difficulty to have this system as a bound state @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a thorough calculation of the @xmath14 system using faddeev equations to see the possibility to find bound states or resonances .",
    "the interest in the three hadron systems is old . in @xcite",
    "there was already a study of such possible systems based only on symmetries . however , recently a qualitative step forward has been taken in this topic , which has been made possible by combining elements of unitarized chiral perturbation theory @xmath15 @xcite with faddeev equations in coupled channels @xcite . in @xcite systems of two mesons and one baryon with strangeness @xmath16",
    "were studied , finding resonant states which could be identified with two @xmath17 and four @xmath18 known low - lying resonances with @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , in the case of the @xmath20 sector the @xmath21 appears neatly as a resonance of the @xmath22 system , as well as including the channels coupled to @xmath22 within su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "the study in @xmath6 = 0 sector was further extended by using the experimental data on the @xmath23 scattering and by adding more coupled channels in @xcite , the outcome of which was the dynamical generation of three resonances , one with quantum numbers of the @xmath24 ( 2100 ) , another with those of the @xmath25 ( 1910 ) , plus a new @xmath24 at @xmath26 1920 mev ( also predicted by jido et .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "developments along the same direction in three - meson system produced a resonant state of @xmath27 @xcite which could be identified with the x(2175 ) resonance reported at babar @xcite and later on at bes @xcite .",
    "the achievements obtained in the former studies and especially the finding of several low - lying @xmath6 = -1 resonances with two meson - one baryon structure motivates us to have a fresh look at the @xmath28 system using our formalism and to make a thorough investigation of the possibility to have the system bound .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper . as we will show in the following section",
    ", we do not get the system bound in the region of the possible s=1 state of @xcite . at higher energies",
    "a bump appears which , however , does not have the ordinary shape of the resonances that we have found in other channels .",
    "this could correspond to some of the bumps seen using the time delay method in the analysis of the @xmath29 system in @xcite .",
    "we solve the faddeev equations for the @xmath0 system following the formalism developed in @xcite , in which it was shown that the integral faddeev equations can be rewritten as a coupled system of algebraic equations using unitary chiral dynamics .",
    "the main feature of this approach is the explicit cancellation between the contribution of the off - shell part of the two - body @xmath4-matrices in the three - body diagrams and the corresponding three - body contact term originating from the same chiral lagrangians . due to this peculiarity",
    ", the faddeev equations can be transformed into the following set of coupled channel equations @xcite @xmath30 \\\\",

    "the invariant masses of the other two subsystems can be written in terms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as explained in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath100 matrices for the energy range 1500 mev @xmath101 2100 mev , with the motivation to find some structure around 1540 mev , and for 600 @xmath102 1100 mev to generate dynamically the @xmath91 ( 800 ) in the @xmath11 subsystem in order to have some attractive interaction in the three - body system .",
    "we do not find any resonance in the isospin 1 and 2 configurations .",
    "we obtain one peak with a broad structure in the squared amplitude in isospin zero ( i.e. , when the @xmath66 subsystem is in isospin @xmath103 ) around 1720 mev .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the peak is of the order of 200 mev .",
    "these features have nothing in common with the resonance claimed in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath99 , for which the bump is found , is around the mass of the @xmath91 ( 800 ) resonance .",
    "we show this peak in fig.1 , where we plot the amplitude square for the total isospin zero . as is evident from the figure , the structure of the peak is far from a breit - wigner .",
    "though the strength of this amplitude is similar to that of the corresponding @xmath104 -1 case @xcite , its shape is different from those of the clear resonances found in the latter .",
    "its unconventional peaking behaviour cast doubts whether this peak could have a pole associated in the complex plane , the accepted criterium to define a peak as a resonance .",
    "the technique to extrapolate the amplitudes to the complex plane with the two variables that we have is not available and looks nontrivial , since it involves working with complex momenta for some particles and real for others . yet , independently from whether the structure found deserves or not to be called a resonance , the fact remains that the chiral dynamics of this coupled channel three - body system leads to such a bump in the cross section in a region where the system clusters like a @xmath91 and a nucleon .",
    "this peak should be visible in @xmath11 scattering with the quantum numbers @xmath105 , @xmath19 , but even better in the @xmath106 reaction , since the peak appears well above the @xmath28 threshold , or in any reaction producing @xmath107 in @xmath105 in the final state .",
    "system as a function of the total energy and the invariant mass of the @xmath66 subsystem.,width=453 ]    interestingly , a broad structure at around 1800 mev seems to be present in the data @xcite of @xmath108 scattering in the @xmath109 partial wave and in the time delay analysis of these data @xcite , which could correspond to the peak shown in fig.1 .",
    "the possibility of existence of strangeness + 1 baryon with a strong coupling to the @xmath47 system has been investigated by solving faddeev equations in the formalism which has generated dynamically many strange and non strange resonances in three - body systems .",
    "we do not find any structure in the energy region close to 1542 mev , therefore , the interpretation of a possible @xmath110 as a @xmath111 bound state , with all the interactions in @xmath112-wave , is ruled out .",
    "a bump is found around 1720 mev with about 200 mev of width and with isospin zero , which reveals the underlying chiral dynamics of the three - body system , and that we hope can be seen in @xmath108 scattering , but much better in reactions producing @xmath28 in @xmath105 in the final state .",
