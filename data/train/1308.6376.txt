    "<S> we explore the dynamics of a bose gas following its quench to a strongly interacting regime near a feshbach resonance . within a self - consistent bogoliubov analysis </S>",
    "<S> we find that after the initial condensate - quasiparticle rabi oscillations , at long time scales the gas is characterized by a nonequilibrium steady - state momentum distribution function , with depletion , condensate density and contact that deviate strongly from their corresponding equilibrium values . </S>",
    "<S> these are in a qualitative agreement with recent experiments on @xmath0rb by makotyn , et al . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also suggests that for sufficiently deep quenches close to the resonance the nonequilibrium state undergoes a phase transition to a fully depleted state , characterized by a vanishing condensate density .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental realizations of trapped degenerate atomic gases coupled with field - tuned feshbach resonances ( fr ) @xcite have led to studies of quantum states of matter in previously unexplored , extremely coherent , strongly interacting regimes . </S>",
    "<S> some of the notable early successes include a realization of paired s - wave superfluidity and the corresponding bcs - to - bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) crossover@xcite , phase transitions driven by species imbalance@xcite , and the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition in optical lattices@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , much of the attention has turned to nonequilibrium analogs of these quantum states , made possible by unmatched high tunability ( adiabatic or sudden quench ) of system parameters , such as fr interactions and single - particle ( e.g. , trap and lattice ) potentials in atomic gases . </S>",
    "<S> quenched dynamics of fr fermionic gases have been extensively explored theoretically , predicting coherent post - quench oscillations @xcite and topological nonequilibrium steady states and phase transitions @xcite . in bosonic gases </S>",
    "<S> such quench studies date back to seminal work on @xmath0rb @xcite , illustrating coherent rabi - like oscillations between atomic and molecular condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , oscillations have also been observed in quasi - two - dimensional bosonic @xmath1cs , following shallow quenches between weakly - repulsive interactions @xcite , and have stimulated theoretical studies of weak two - dimensional quenches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given that resonant bosonic gases are predicted to exhibit atomic - to - molecular superfluid phase transition ( rather than just a fermionic smooth bcs - bec crossover ) and other interesting phenomenology @xcite , we expect their quenched dynamics to be even richer , providing further motivation for our study .    </S>",
    "<S> fundamentally , such bose gases become unstable upon approach to a fr ( where two - particle scattering length @xmath2 diverges ) due to a growth of the three - body loss rate @xmath3 relative to the two - body scattering rate @xmath4 . on general grounds , in the limit of @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> these rates are expected and found @xcite to saturate at an order of fermi - like energy ( energy set by atom density , which for simplicity we will just call fermi energy ) @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , exhibiting universality akin to unitary fermi gases @xcite . however , as was recently discovered in @xmath0rb @xcite , quenches on the molecular ( @xmath8 ) side of the resonance , even near the unitarity , the three - body rate appears to be more than an order of magnitude slower than the two - body rate ( both proportional to fermi energy , as expected ) , thereby opening up a window of time scales for metastable strongly - interacting nonequilibrium dynamics .    stimulated by these experiments @xcite and taking the aforementioned slowness of @xmath9 as an empirical fact , in this report we study the upper - branch effectively repulsive dynamics of a three - dimensional gas of strongly interacting bosonic atoms following a _ deep _ detuning quench close to the unitary point on the molecular side ( @xmath10 ) of the fr . before turning to the analysis , we present highlights of our results that show qualitative agreement with jila experiments @xcite and discuss the limits of their validity .    following a sudden shift in interaction from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( we take @xmath13 throughout ) leaves the system in an excited state of the shifted hamiltonian , @xmath14 that leads to a nontrivial dynamics associated with rabi - like oscillations between an atomic condensate and bogoliubov quasi - particles . </S>",
    "<S> although such oscillations have indeed been seen in shallow quenches@xcite , they do not appear to have been observed in deep quenches to unitarity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that oscillations at frequencies corresponding to different momenta @xmath15 decohere on longer time scales , set by the inverse of the bogoliubov spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we thus observe that the momentum distribution function , @xmath16 approaches a steady state form at a time scale growing as @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for momenta larger ( smaller ) than the coherence momentum , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the full distribution function reaches a nonequilibrium steady state at the longest time scale @xmath20 set by the cloud size , @xmath21 , beyond which it is characterized by a time - independent momentum distribution function illustrated in fig.[nk_ssfig ] . within our self - consistent bogoliubov theory @xmath22 never fully thermalizes , although is expected to on physical grounds if bogoliubov quasi - particle collisions are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> however , if this latter rate is significantly slower than the interaction energy ( set by the chemical potential ) , we would expect our prediction for @xmath23 ( fig.[nk_tfig ] )     following a scattering length quench @xmath24 in a resonant bose gas.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    and its long - time steady - state form ( illustrated in fig.[nk_ssfig ] ) @xmath25 to capture the nonequilibrium momentum distribution observed in jila experiments@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> , approached at long times , following a scattering length quench @xmath26 ( illustrated for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) in a resonant bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> the inset illustrates the presence of the @xmath29 large momentum tail.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in eq.[nk_infty ] @xmath30 is the effective finite - density scattering length and @xmath31 is the asymptotic steady - state value of the condensate density , @xmath32 , which is self - consistently determined by the depletion @xmath33 , illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ndtfig ] . </S>",
    "<S> after time set by @xmath34 the depletion saturates at a nonequilibrium value , @xmath35 ( calculated below ) , which deviates significantly from the adiabatic depletion , i.e. , the equilibrium value corresponding to the scattering length @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that for @xmath37 , the asymptotic condensate density is driven to zero ; this contrasts with the equilibrium state , where in three dimensions at @xmath38 the gas is a bec at arbitrary strong interactions , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis thus suggests@xcite that for a sufficiently deep quench , the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition to a non - bec steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the nonequilibrium transition is set by the critical depth of the quench for which the associated excitation energy , @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the ground state of @xmath14 ) significantly exceeds @xmath42 .     as a function of pulse duration @xmath43 , following a scattering length quench @xmath26 in a resonant bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows an approximate collapse of the scaled depletion , with only a weak dependence on other parameters.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we obtain these results using a self - consistent bogoliubov theory , implemented in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , to ensure that the condensate fraction @xmath44 remains positive [ equivalently , the depletion @xmath45 does not exceed the total atom number @xmath46 , as it can at strong coupling within straight bogoliubov theory ] , we solve the heisenberg equations of motion for the finite momentum quasi - particles using a time - dependent bogoliubov hamiltonian , where @xmath44 appears as a self - consistently determined function . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is the bosonic analog of the self - consistently determined bcs gap function in fermionic systems@xcite and for a uniform state is equivalent to solving the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate @xmath47 in conjunction with heisenberg equations for the finite momentum excitations @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> our second `` beyond - bogoliubov '' approximation is the replacement of the scattering length @xmath36 by the density dependent scattering amplitude @xmath49 , this qualitatively captures the crossover from the two - atom regime , @xmath50 to a finite density limit , when @xmath36 reaches inter - particle spacing and the scattering amplitude saturates at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> while the details of the crossover function are _ ad hock _ , our qualitative predictions are insensitive to these details and depend on the limiting values of the two regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> after the @xmath26 quench the atomic resonant gas with a free dispersion @xmath52 is governed by a single - channel bosonic hamiltonian @xmath53 , with the final interaction parameter , @xmath54 and corresponding scattering length , @xmath36 , tunable via a magnetic field near a feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the experiments@xcite , we focus on the initial states and their subsequent evolution , which , although possibly strongly depleted and time - dependent , are confined to a well - established condensate ( focusing for simplicity on periodic boundary conditions without a trap ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to make progress in treating the resonant interactions , by expanding in finite - momentum quasi - particle fluctuations about a macroscopically occupied @xmath55 state , and thereby to reduce the hamiltonian to the quadratic form , @xmath56(t ) , where @xmath57 with a new ingredient that the time - dependent condensate density is self - consistently determined by @xmath58 in the initial , pre - quench state @xmath59 at @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> focussing on zero temperature , we take state @xmath59 to be the vacuum with respect to the quasi - particles @xmath61 , that diagonalize the initial hamiltonian , @xmath62 , characterized by a pre - quench scattering length , @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding heisenberg equation of motion @xmath64 for @xmath65 is conveniently encoded in terms of a time - dependent bogoliubov transformation @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 are time - independent bosonic reference operators ( ensured by @xmath69 ) , that diagonalize the hamiltonian at the initial time @xmath70 after the quench , @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , @xmath72 , fixing the initial condition @xmath73 , and @xmath74 for spinor @xmath75 , which evolves according to @xmath76 for a given condensate density @xmath44 the solution for the evolution operator @xmath77 can be found exactly@xcite and for a slowly evolving @xmath44 it is well approximated by an instantaneous bogoliubov transformation for @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . using this and the relation of the atomic operators at the initial time to pre- and post - quench bogoliubov operators @xmath82 we have @xmath83 we can now compute arbitrary dynamic atomic correlators , such as the structure function , the rf spectroscopy signal , and the momentum distribution function in terms of these time - dependent matrices@xcite . focusing on the momentum distribution function ( measured in the jila experiments@xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find ( see the appendix ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 with normalized @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> we close this equation by using it to self - consistently compute the time - dependent condensate density @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve numerically the corresponding equation for @xmath91 @xmath92 with the solution for @xmath45 illustrated in fig.[ndtfig ] .     as a function of interaction strength , @xmath93 . for a sufficiently deep quench , @xmath94 ( for @xmath95 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the asymptotic condensate density vanishes , suggesting a phase transition to a non - bose condensed nonequilibrium steady state.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the long - time limit ( averaging away the oscillatory component ) eq.[ncsceqn ] reduces to an equation for @xmath96 , which then determines the steady - state momentum distribution function , @xmath97 in eq.[nk_infty ] . </S>",
    "<S> the associated long - time depletion @xmath98 deviates significantly from the ground - state value , @xmath99 at the corresponding @xmath36 .     </S>",
    "<S> associated with the asymptotic momentum distribution function as a function of the interaction strength @xmath93 to which the system is quenched from @xmath95.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as is clear from the inset of fig.[nk_ssfig ] , the long - time momentum distribution function @xmath97 exhibits a large momentum @xmath29 tail , @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the corresponding nonequilibrium contact , @xmath101 @xcite is given by @xmath102 \\label{cinfty}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is illustrated in fig.[c_fig ] .    finally , we observe that our long - time solution @xmath103 of eq.[ncsceqn ] monotonically decreases with @xmath93 , vanishing at the critical quench value of @xmath104 ( see fig.[nc_fig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests@xcite that such deep quenches excite the zero - temperature bose gas to high enough energies , @xmath105 , so as to fully deplete the condensate and to drive a nonequilibrium transition to a non - bec state . </S>",
    "<S> this is not an unreasonable nonequilibrium counterpart of a thermal bec - to - normal gas transition .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we studied the dynamics of a resonant bose gas , following a deep quench to a large positive scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing a self - consistent extension of a bogoliubov theory , which allows us to approximately account for a large depletion and a time - dependent condensate density , we computed the nonequilibrium momentum distribution function , @xmath23 and a variety of properties derived from it . </S>",
    "<S> they show reasonable qualitative agreement with recent experiments@xcite , but also leave many interesting open questions for future studies@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these include an exact numerical solution of the self - consistent eqs . - to verify our approximate solution , and the incorporation of the molecular state expected to appear on the bound - state side of the resonance , through the analysis of the two - channel model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , research is under way to extend our work to include quasi - particle interaction , which will account for the thermalization expected on general grounds and observed experimentally .    </S>",
