    "the calculation must then treat appropriately the specific hierarchies of the problem to avoid that hugely different physical scales appear simultaneously in the same numerical integration . in this introduction",
    "we first intend to make the various hierarchies explicit . in the second place",

    "the inclusion of large - scale magnetic fields amounts to the addition of two extra parameters .",

    "all the possible ( non - adiabatic ) initial conditions of the magnetized einstein - boltzmann hierarchy have been worked out analytically and scrutinized numerically .",
    "the results reported in @xcite and in @xcite bring the treatment of magnetized cmb anisotropies to the same standards employed in the case when large - scale magnetic fields are absent from the very beginning .",
    "the problem left out from previous analyses , as stressed in @xcite , has to do with a more consistent calculation of the polarization observables .",
    "the problem is , in short , the following .",
    "the large - scale description of temperature anisotropies demands a coarse grained ( one - fluid ) approach for the electron - ion system : this is the so called baryon fluid which is treated ( with no exceptions ) as a single fluid in popular boltzmann solvers such as cosmics , cmbfast and their descendants . on the other hand the dispersive propagation of electromagnetic disturbances demands to treat separately electrons and ions , at least at high frequencies .",
    "faraday rotation is one of the situations where the inadequacy of the one - fluid approximation ( for the baryon - lepton fluid ) is manifest .",
    "the positive and negative helicities composing the ( linear ) cmb polarization experience , in a background magnetic field , two different phase velocities , two different dielectric contants and , ultimately , two different refractive indices .",
    "the mismatch between the refractive index of the positive and negative helicities induces , effectively , a rotation of the cmb polarization and , hence , a b - mode .",
    "the inclusion of the faraday effect in the treatment implies , physically , that the proton - electron fluid ( sometimes dubbed as baryon fluid ) should be treated as effectively composed by two different species , i.e. the electrons and the ions .",
    "various studies were concerned , in the past , with the estimate of faraday rotation effects in the framework of cmb physics .",
    "none of the previous studies , however , could profit of a dedicated numerical approach where the effects of the magnetic fields could be included at the level of the initial conditions and at the level of the dynamical equations . before outlining the analytical and numerical strategies used in the present paper the main results obtained so far will be summarized .    in @xcite",
    "it has been noted , within slightly different perspectives , that the ( linear ) cmb polarization can be faraday rotated .",
    "a common aspect of the attempts of @xcite was that the magnetic field was assumed to be _ uniform _",
    "( i.e. homogeneous in space ) and described within a simplified magnetohydrodynamical description which consisted , effectively , to enforce the conservation of the magnetic flux . in @xcite , on the basis of an explicit model , it was argued that the magnetic fields should be treated , in fact , as stochastically distributed if we do not want to break ( explicitly ) the spatial isotropy of the background geometry : the large - scale magnetic fields arise typically from the parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations or from some phase transition ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and in both cases the produced fields are not uniform but rather stochastically distributed .",
    "the first convincing measurements of cmb polarization @xcite ( see also @xcite ) clearly suggested the adiabaticity of the initial conditions ( because of the location of the first anticorrelation peak in the te power spectra ) . in @xcite",
    "the tb correlations have been computed from the initial te correlations provided by the adiabatic mode .",
    "the main assumption of @xcite has been that the magnetic field is , once more , uniform and that it does not affect , in any way , the initial te angular power spectra . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was recognized that the uniform field case is not realistic .",
    "the interplay between stochastic magnetic fields and faraday rotation has been more directly scrutinized .",
    "the work of ref . @xcite suggested to treat the effect by applying a faraday screen to the cmb polarization .",
    "also in @xcite the main assumption has been to neglect any possible effect of the magnetic fields on the te and ee angular power spectra .    in the present paper , it will not be assumed that the large - scale magnetic fields are uniform .",
    "hence , the direct effects of the magnetic fields on the te and ee angular power spectra will not be neglected .",
    "the line of reasoning pursued in the present paper is based on the plasma hierarchies outlined in eqs .",
    "( [ gplasma ] ) and in eqs .",
    "( [ hier1])([hier3 ] ) .",
    "the strategy will be to generalize , around matter - radiation equality and throughout decoupling , the standard treatment of weakly coupled plasmas in the different branches of the spectrum of plasma excitations . the smallness of @xmath13 ( together with the smallness of the electrons and ions kinetic temperatures in comparison with the corresponding masses ) allows to enforce the ( cold ) plasma approximation to an excellent degree .",
    "the flat space - equations can not be simply employed around decoupling or even equality since space - time is not flat .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations of the geometry must be properly taken into account since they are still relativistic at the time when the initial conditions of the temperature and polarization anisotropies are customarily set @xcite.the physical rationale for the strategy employed here is rooted on the simple observation of eq .",
    "( [ hier4 ] ) , which stipulates that the larmor radius is always smaller than the typical inhomogeneity scale of the magnetic field .",
    "the approximation which will be adopted here is called , in plasma physics , the guiding center approximation and it is due to the pioneering work of alfvn @xcite .",
    "a relevant class of results of the present investigation concerns the problem of simulating maps of magnetized cmb anisotropies .",
    "magnetized maps of the temperature and polarization observables will be reported to illustrate the viability of our numerical approach . in the light of the planck explorer mission @xcite it will be particularly important to have magnetized maps both for the temperature autocorrelations and maps for the polarization observables .",
    "this step is mandatory once the corresponding angular power spectra can be numerically computed . with our numerical code ,",
    "appropriately extended to include the faraday mixing term and the two - fluid effects , we are able to compute accurately all the required power spectra .",
    "armed with all these necessary theoretical tools , magnetized cmb maps can be obtained .",

    "this is certainly justified for typical scales @xmath40 ( see also eq .",
    "( [ gplasma ] ) ) and for frequencies parametrically smaller than the plasma frequency . owing to the largeness of the coulomb rate ions and electrons",
    "are tightly coupled and the effective degree of freedom which should be studied is the so - called baryon velocity , i.e. the centre - of - mass velocity of the electron - ion system .",
    "furthermore , owing to the largeness of thompson scattering , baryons and photons are also tightly coupled ( but just well before equality ) .",
    "this observation is the basis of the tight - coupling expansion which was pioneered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and since then widely used for semi - analytical estimates of the cmb temperature autocorrelations .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields are included in the game some of the considerations of the previous paragraph apply @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , if we ought to treat phenomena related to the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances in a plasma , the one - fluid description is known to be insufficient @xcite .",
    "the insufficiency of the one - fluid description is already apparent in the calculation of the magnetized polarization observables .",

    "the evolution equations of the problem will now be introduced with particular attention to the electromagnetic part .",
    "there is the custom of treating dispersive phenomena within a single fluid plasma description .",
    "this habit is , strictly speaking , misleading as already pointed out in @xcite .",
