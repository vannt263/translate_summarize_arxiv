    "such extensions are motivated by the fact that ( i ) in molecular - based realizations of scm s , antiferromagnetic coupling typically has a larger intensity than the ferromagnetic one ; in fact , the overlapping of magnetic orbitals , which implies antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between neighboring spins , can be more easily obtained than the orthogonality condition , leading to ferromagnetism  @xcite ; ( ii ) non - collinearity between local anisotropy axes and the crystallographic ( laboratory ) frame takes place quite often in molecular spin chains . besides magnetization reversal , the dynamic response of the system to a weak magnetic field , oscillating in time at frequency @xmath0 , is also studied .",

    "to this aim , we adopt the following model hamiltonian @xmath13 @xmath6 is an effective ising exchange coupling that can approximately be related to the hamiltonian parameters of a real scm  @xcite : see later on the discussion in section v. like in the usual ising - glauber collinear model ( [ ising_hamiltonian_in_glauber ] ) , the spins in eq .",

    "thanks to the particular choices and for the transition probability , by imposing the detailed balance conditions  @xcite it is possible to express @xmath34 and @xmath36 as functions of the parameters in the spin hamiltonian ( [ non_collinear_h ] ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the inverse temperature in units of boltzmann s constant .",
