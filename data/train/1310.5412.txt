    "the standard model of cosmology requires existence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles .",
    "the main role of cdm particles is to establish the gravitational skeleton of large scale structures @xcite .",
    "an important statistical property of the dark matter structures is the power - spectrum of the structures which is predicted by e.g. the inflationary cosmology as one of the possible paradigms for the early universe @xcite .",
    "the standard model of cosmology predicts nearly scale invariant , adiabatic and gaussian distribution of matter at the early stages of the universe and the evolution of these structures strongly depend on the properties of the dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "+ one of the predictions of cdm paradigm is the hierarchical structure formation , the existence of cdm sub - structures ( from sub - haloes , down to microhaloes ) embedded in the larger haloes @xcite .",
    "the larger haloes host baryonic matter in the form of hot gas and stars at their centers .",
    "however , smaller haloes do not have enough gravitational potential to confine baryonic matter , hence microhaloes may not host any baryonic component .",
    "an alternative to the dark matter paradigm is the modified gravity models , where the missing gravitational mass in the structures , and the universe , is compensated by the modification to the law(s ) of gravity @xcite . both dark matter and",
    "modified gravity models , at some level , can explain the rotation curves of the galaxies and formation of the structures @xcite . however , it is hard to explain the whole range of observations , as the cluster of galaxies in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite fails , while the scalar - tensor vector gravity ( stvg ) also so - called mog can explain the dynamics of clusters in the context of baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "the major efforts to test the existence of cdm particles have been performed in the underground experiments and null results from these experiments continue to push further constraints on the parameter space of the dark matter particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the indirect searches for cdm are yet to result in conclusive evidence of its presence .",
    "while the main evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational effect on large scales , different campaigns have studied its small - scale properties .",
    "one of the main efforts has been done by the gravitational microlensing experiments .",
    "these experiments monitor stars in the large and small magellanic clouds and measured the magnification of stars by lensing .",
    "after a decade of observation , they could rule out dark matter in the form of massive compact objects in the halo , for nearly the entire range of viable astrophysical masses @xcite .",
    "another proposal is astrometrical observation of the background stars by the lensing effect of the microhaloes @xcite .",
    "the substructures in the parent halo can also modify the flux ratio of images in a strong lensing system @xcite . the microhaloes may also change the pulsation time of the pulsars due to the shapiro and doppler effects @xcite .    here",
    ", we propose yet another indirect gravitational method for the possible observation of the dark matter microhaloes , using the transient gravitational lensing on cosmological scales . in the dark matter scenario ,",
    "the hierarchy of the structure formation predicts the existence of microhalo structures embedded in the larger haloes @xcite .",
    "these structures have formed at high redshifts , and due to their small masses , have small virial velocity dispersions of @xmath2 km / s . due to the thermal pressure of the intergalactic medium ,",
    "the baryonic matter can not cool and condense into the gravitational potential of the microhaloes .",
    "the result is the formation of small non - baryonic structures , made of only the dark matter . in the case",
    "that these microhaloes cross our line of sight towards a cosmological source , such as a quasar , they could cause a slight change in the source flux due to the weak lensing effect . unlike to the traditional weak lensing on the cosmological scales ,",
    "the motion of the microhaloes provides a time varying magnification effect .",
    "let us make a simple estimate of the effect : observations over a time period @xmath3 are sensitive to microhaloes of the size @xmath4 , where @xmath5 km / s is the characteristic peculiar velocity on cosmological scales .",
    "assuming the hierarchical structure formation scenario , we put all the mass of the universe in microhaloes of density @xmath6 , i.e. : m = |_m r^3 .",
    "if a typical microhalo forms at redshift @xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) , its density is enhanced by a factor of @xmath8 due to collapse , and then diluted by a factor of @xmath9 @xcite due to subsequent tidal stripping , so we find @xmath10 .",
    "the magnification by a single microhalo at distance @xmath11 is then given by : & & a_single ~4gd ~(2_m h^2_0 ) ( vt ) d + ~&&5 10 ^ -9 ( v 500   km / s)(t 1   yr ) ( 10 ^ 5 ) ( d 3   gpc ) , + where we assumed @xmath12 and @xmath13 km / s mpc@xmath14 .",
    "this is clearly a tiny number !",
    "however , let us now estimate the optical depth , or the number of such microhaloes that cross the line of sight : & & = r^2 d ~ + ~ & & 410 ^ 7 ( v 500   km / s)^-1(t 1   yr)^-1 ( 10 ^ 5 ) ^-1 ( d 3  gpc ) .",
    "+ therefore , the variance or noise in magnification due to the _ collective _ random contributions of many microhaloes becomes : & & a_tot .",
    "= a_single~ + & & 3 10 ^ -5 ( v 500   km / s)^1/2(t 1   yr)^1/2 ( 10 ^ 5 ) ^1/2 ( d 3  gpc)^3/2 .",
    "+ this simple estimate illustrates the magnitude of the red stochastic photometric noise expected from transient weak lensing by millions of microhaloes that cross the line of sight to cosmological point sources . as we show in the paper , this effect could be magnified by as much as @xmath15 for strongly lensed quasars , leading to variabilities of @xmath16 over months to years timescales .",
    "moreover , the signal is expected to be close to gaussian , roughly to one part in @xmath17 ( from the central limit theorem ) , as it is contributed by many uncorrelated ( and comparable ) microhaloes .",
    "therefore , temporal power spectrum should provide all the statistics necessary to quantify this noise .",
    "one may worry that the cut - off of the cdm hierarchy is ignored in the above estimate , and no variation will be observed below a time - scale associated with this cut - off . in particular ,",
    "the time - scale to cross the virial radius of a @xmath18 microhalo that formed at @xmath19 is @xmath20 years .",
    "nevertheless , even the smallest haloes are predicted to have a central cusp in the cdm paradigm , and thus their passage close to the line of sight can lead to rapid time - variations .",
    "for example , the cross - section for being within distance @xmath21 of a central cusp is @xmath22 , while the surface density for a singular isothermal profile is @xmath23 . since @xmath24",
    ", these two effects exactly cancel each other .",
    "simulated microhalo profiles are shallower in their center than singular isothermal ( e.g. @xmath25 in @xcite ) , which leads to a slight steepening of the transient weak lensing noise below time - scales associated with the scale - radius of microhaloes .",
    "we further quantify this effect in sec .",
    "[ sdss ] .    in the rest of the paper , we present a precise formulation for the variability power spectrum in the lensing magnification , by assigning a velocity field to the perturbation of the metric perpendicular to our line of sight towards a given quasar .",
    "we do this calculation , both using the geodesic equation and using luminosity distance corrections to the focusing equation . finally , we compare results with the present data from quasars and suggest an observational strategy for long term light curve measurement of quasars with high precision photometry .",
    "the structure of paper is as follows : in section [ wl ] we use the perturbation theory in frw and obtain fluctuations in the flux of quasar due to weak lensing of microhaloes on the cosmological scales . in appendix [ angd ]",
    "we repeat this calculation with the angular diameter distance formalism .",
    "we obtain the expected temporal power spectrum of the fluctuations of the light curve of a quasar for different non - linear models of structures in section [ obs ] .",
    "we then compare microhalo weak lensing signals with the intrinsic variation of quasar light and other backgrounds , such as stellar microlensing on the cosmological scales .",
    "in particular , we propose monitoring of multiply imaged quasar strong lensing systems as a way to distinguish the transient weak lensing effect from intrinsic variations .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section , we formulate the time variation of a source flux located at a cosmological distance , due to the lensing effect of dm substructures .",
    "we let the perturbations in the frw metric move relative to the line of sight due to the peculiar velocity of structures and dispersion velocity of sub - structures embedded in a larger structure .",
    "hence the transverse velocity produce a transient weak lensing effect and observationally the light curve of source can change with time .    we start with calculation of the geodesics equation of the light ray from the source to the observer .",
    "the perturbed frw metric in the newtonian gauge for the matter dominant era is given as below @xcite : @xmath26dt^2+a^2\\delta_{ij}[1 + 2\\phi(\\vec{x},t)]dx^i dx^j , \\label{pert - met}\\ ] ] where we set @xmath27 .",
    "the transverse spatial component of the light ray as well as the longitudinal direction follows the geodesics equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the index of the spatial coordinate and @xmath30 , the affine parameter is the comoving time measured by the observers along the light ray .",
    "this affine parameter in the homogenous frw universe is related to the coordinate time @xmath3 and comoving distance @xmath31 through the scale factor : @xmath32 we assume a small transverse perturbation in the trajectory of the light rays compare to the longitudinal observer - lens and observer - source distances . using the christoffel symbols from metric in eq.([pert - met ] ) and ignoring the higher orders of the perturbations , the geodesic equation simplifies to @xmath33 where we replace the affine parameter with the comoving distance form eq .",
    "( [ affine ] ) .",
    "now we change the transverse comoving coordinate with the angular position of the light ray to get the angular position of the source as function of angular position of images . integrating eq.([geo1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular position of the source , @xmath36 is the observed angular position of the image and @xmath37 is the comoving distance of the observer to the source .",
    "we simplify the double integral as @xmath38 the maping matrix from the image space to the source space is given by @xmath39 the jacobian of transformation matrix in eq.([transform ] ) within the framework of geometric optics provides the magnification by @xmath40 .",
    "for the low magnifications , ignoring higher order terms , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 we note that @xmath43 is defined in two dimension lens plane , perpendicular to the line of sight . in the fourier space @xmath44",
    "can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are transverse and parallel wavenumbers . in writing eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) , we use the so - called _ moving sheet _",
    "approximation @xcite , where we assume the time dependence of the lensing potential is entirely due to the coherent transverse motion of a lensing sheet .",
    "this approximation is justified as motion is dominated by cosmic velocities that are coherent on large scales .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) , only the transverse coordinate is a function of time , @xmath48 . substituting equation ( [ fourier ] ) in ( [ mag1 ] ) , the time variation of the magnification @xmath41 obtained as : @xmath49 in appendix [ angd ] , we repeat this calculation and derive magnification variation based on the angular diameter distance method",
    "now using this result , we investigate the statistics of magnitude variation as a function of duration of observation in the next section .",
    "imagine that we are measuring the light curve of a point like source at a cosmological distance .",
    "for an ideal quasar with stable light curve , we can define the correlation function in the magnification of the source due to the lensing by the microhaloes as follows :    @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 correspond to two subsequent observations with the interval of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the transverse velocity of substructures , which we have assumed to have a maxwellian distribution and 1d dispersion velocity of @xmath55 . here",
    "the transverse velocity is normalized to the cosmological scale factor to represent the velocity in the comoving space .",
    "we note that the peculiar velocity of the structures is a redshift and scale dependant parameter . using the definition of the potential power spectrum : @xmath56 and substituting in eq.([cor1 ] ) , we can integrate over @xmath57 for an ensemble of structures as follows : @xmath58 ignoring the longitudinal contribution in @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , and integrating over @xmath47 and @xmath61 , the correlation function simplifies to : @xmath62 in order to relate this correlation function with the observation , we replace the power spectrum in the potential with the density contrast , using the poisson equation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the density of universe at redshift @xmath65 . using frw equation , we",
    "can we write the poisson equation as @xmath66 consequently , the power spectrum of the potential in terms of dimensionless power - spectrum @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 substituting eq.([phipot ] ) in eq.([cor2 ] ) , correlation function of the light curve is given by @xmath69 for structure with the size of @xmath70 , a given transverse velocity of @xmath54 implies the frequency of @xmath71 in the light curve .",
    "replacing @xmath46 with @xmath72 , we use the definition of the temporal power spectrum as follows @xmath73 where we replace @xmath74 .",
    "then the dimensionless power spectrum of the light curve is given by @xmath75 ^ 2 \\frac{\\delta^2(\\frac{\\omega a } { v},z_{\\chi'})}{\\omega}(1+z_{\\chi^{\\prime}})^{{3}},\\ ] ]    here the power spectrum of magnification depends on distribution of dm which manifests itself by the matter power spectrum @xmath76 . in order to calculate power - spectrum @xmath77 ,",
    "corresponding to the light curve , we need a model for the evolution of velocity dispersion of dm substructures and the distribution of the matter in the small scales .    the velocity of cdm microhaloes results from the dispersion velocity in the galactic haloes , which in the host halo of typical galaxies @xmath78 km / s , and from the bulk flow velocity in the intergalactic medium , that is @xmath79 km / s @xcite .",
    "now , in order to estimate the sensitivity of our observations to the scale of the relevant dark matter structures , we assume performing the light curve observations of a quasar from @xmath80 day to @xmath81 years . assuming the corresponding velocities for the microhaloes , the time variation of quasar will probe nonlinear regime on the length scales of @xmath82 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "these scales are significantly smaller than the reach of numerical simulations , or standard semi - analytical models ( e.g. halo model ) @xcite .    in the next subsection ,",
    "we review the stable clustering hypothesis as a theoretical model for the small scale nonlinear clustering of cdm ( and its microhaloes ) .",
    "we then use this model to predict the amplitude of fluctuations in the quasar light curves due to transient weak lensing .      in this section",
    "we introduce the semi - analytical formalism of stable clustering in the phase space , along with other non - linear models of small scale clustering .",
    "the reason we require a semi - analytic model such as stable clustering is that numerical simulations can only explore the distribution of matter up to the scales of @xmath83 mpc@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , currently there is no reliable observational constrains on the cdm power spectrum on sub - mpc small scales .",
    "the stable clustering model was first introduced by davis & peebles as an analytical method for calculating the correlation function of the structures in the deep non - linear regime @xcite . in this model",
    "it is assumed that the number of neighboring particles remains fixed . in other words",
    ", the pairwise velocity vanishes on small scales for non - linear structures .",
    "the idea was later extended to the phase space , where the number of particles in the vicinity of each point ( i.e. fixed position and velocity ) was assumed to not change with time @xcite . in the stable clustering hypothesis in phase space , for the small scales ,",
    "the correlation function of densities is related to phase - space density as @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the phase space density , @xmath86 is the average density of matter and @xmath87 is the fraction of dark matter substructure that survived tidal stripping .",
    "@xmath88 is the phase space density of dm particles in the small volume of phase space ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) obtained from spherical collapse results @xcite and is related to the linear matter power spectrum through the variance of matter density ( see @xcite for a detailed calculations ) . for our study",
    ", we also need to know the matter power spectrum at different redshifts . within the stable clustering hypothesis ,",
    "the phase - space density @xmath88 is assumed to be constant , and thus the evolution is simply given by the evolution of the background density .",
    "hence the correlation function for the the small size non - linear overdensities can be written as : @xmath91 in fig.([figps ] ) , we plot the dimensionless matter power - spectrum assuming stable clustering hypothesis in the phase space and @xmath92 , should be the density of the halo that hosts the microhaloes ] where @xmath93 and the minimum mass of subhaloes is set to @xmath94 . in fig.([figps ] ) , we also compare the fitting formula of peacock and dodds @xcite ( dash - dot - dot line ) and the halo model @xcite ( long dash line ) for the non - linear power spectrum with the stable clustering .",
    "now from the matter power spectrum and the assumption for the velocity dispersion of dm haloes we can compute the temporal power spectrum of quasar light curve .",
    "we note that in eq .",
    "( [ pomega ] ) , the velocity of structure is a combination of substructure velocity embedded in the halo and velocity of parent structure .",

    "the low magnification in the microlensing events is given by @xmath190 in the field , and @xmath191 in strongly lensed systems , as function of the angular separation @xmath192 , between the quasar and the star .",
    "therefore , events with @xmath193 would have optical depth of unity , implying that magnifications of @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) are common in the field ( strongly lensed systems ) . however , the characteristic time - scale for microlensing events of this size is given by : & & t ( ) ~ ~(_e ) ( r_ev ) = + & & ( 230  yr ) ( /_e 10 ) ( m _ * m _ ) ^1/2 ( ( z_s ) 3  gpc)^1/2 ^-1 , + [ t_theta ] assuming that the typical lens is half - way to the source .",
    "therefore , we see that the characteristic time - scales for typical magnification events ( i.e. with @xmath196 ) is quite long , and thus they are unlikely to contaminate the transient weak lensing due to microhaloes . in appendix [ microlensing ] , we derive the power spectrum of weak stellar microlensing light curves , and show that they are suppressed by @xmath197 $ ] , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ figsigma ] ) for the nominal parameters in eq .",
    "( [ t_theta ] ) .    in denser fields ,",
    "it is more likely to find a star close to the line of sight , so that @xmath197 $ ] is not too small . in such cases ,",
    "the main microlensing signal will be dominated by the handful of stars within the radius @xmath198 .",
    "given the small number of lenses , the statistics of the signal will be very non - gaussian , with significant phase correlation among different fourier amplitudes , as well as a sharp exponential drop at high frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ figsigma ] )",
    ". this will be in contrast with the transient weak lensing due to microhaloes , which ( as we argued in sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) is almost perfectly gaussian , and nearly power - law in frequency @xmath199 ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .      in order to measure the light curve of a source with a given photometric precision",
    ", we use the definition of the signal to noise ratio in each data point due to deviation with respect to the base line by @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the luminosity at @xmath29th point and @xmath202 is the corresponding error bar .",
    "the variance of the signal to noise can be obtain by @xmath203 . in order to have signal to noise larger than a given threshold",
    ", the error bar should satisfy in the following constraint @xmath204 for a given source with the rate of @xmath205 photons per second received by the telescope , the number of collected photons is @xmath206 . considering photometric error due to the poisson fluctuations , the left hand side of equation ( [ s2n ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath207 , where the rate of photons received by a telescope is given by @xmath208 .",
    "then the essential exposure time @xmath209 to achieve a minimum signal to noise of @xmath210 is given by : @xmath211 here we use the flux and magnitude of the sun as reference with the absolute magnitude of @xmath212 and corresponding photon flux of @xmath213 .",
    "for a small size telescope with the diameter of @xmath214 m ( as danish telescope at la silla ) , the minimum exposure time for a star with the magnitude of @xmath215 , having an average signal to noise ratio larger than three , is obtain by @xmath216 for the case of strong lensing images of sdssj1004 + 4112 , we use the redshift of source at @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "also , using the convergence and shear for the lensing clustering as @xmath171 and @xmath172 @xcite , we obtain the overall magnification for transient weak lensing using : @xmath218 here the magnification factor due to strong lensing is @xmath219 , and @xmath220 is the transient magnification , due to microhaloes , in the absence of the strong lens .",
    "figure ( [ figsigma ] ) represents variance in the light curve of the quasar from the transient weak lensing in terms of period of modes for two models of stable clustering , and halo model fitting function .",
    "the variance in the fluctuation of the light curve depends on the cutoff on the mass of microhalos .",
    "this cutoff in the mass is a function of micro - physics of dark matter particles that determines the size of free stream mass scale .",
    "recent simulations provides the profile of the abundant microhalos @xcite for the earth mass halos . in order to study the effect of cutoff mass of microhalos on transient weak lensing effect",
    ", we plot the variance in the light curve of the quasar as a function time scale for three cases of cutoff masses in figure ( [ cutoff ] ) . smaller cutoff results in larger variance in the variation of light curve by the transient weak lensing .    to achieve a @xmath221 signal to noise ratio , a variation in magnification of @xmath222 ( which occur e.g. over a hundred days within the stable clustering model ) , equation ( [ const ] ) implies @xmath223     days .",
    "the standard deviation is obtained for the stable clustering ( solid line ) with @xmath224 , halo model fitting function ( dotted line ) with the cut - off of @xmath116 . the expected signal from a typical cosmological microlensing event is also shown for comparison ( dot - dashed curve ; see appendix [ microlensing ] ) . ]    ) , but for different cutoff masses in the stable clustering model .",
    "smaller cutoff provides larger variation in the light curve as the variance receives contribution from smaller haloes .",
    "this is a more significant effect for shorter time - scales , which are sensitive to smaller haloes . ]    for the case of this quasar , the magnitude of images are in the order of @xmath225 , substituting in equation ( [ const2 ] ) , we get the exposure time of @xmath226 sec .",
    "increasing the diameter of telescope reduces the exposure time as @xmath227 . for a 10-meter class telescope ,",
    "the exposure time reduces by the factor of @xmath228 and we get the exposure time of @xmath229 sec . repeating this calculation for the halo model , which has a smaller standard deviation by an order of magnitude compared the stable clustering model , we would expect that exposure time for detecting signal has to be two orders of magnitudes larger , i.e. @xmath230 . from the technical point of view , we can achieve higher photometric accuracy with long term exposures even with the same size telescopes .",
    "one of the problems with the long exposure times is that ccd may saturate during the photometry .",
    "this problem can be solved by telescope defocusing technique , which is widely used in the transit exoplanet observations @xcite .",
    "another solution is that images can be taken with shorter exposures , then stack to get a desired signal to noise ratio .",
    "in this work , we propose the possibility of observation of transient weak lensing of quasars , as a probe of the microhaloes on the cosmological scales .",
    "these observations can rule out the existence of dark microhaloes or constrain the properties of the dark matter particles , as well as the models of non - linear structure formation .",
    "assuming different models for non - linear structures on small scales , we formulate the weak lensing of the microhaloes by the geodesic and angular distance methods .",
    "we note that , due to weak gravitational potential of these structures they do nt host baryonic / stellar matter in their centers .",
    "the transient weak lensing signal is caused by random contributions of millions of microhaloes , and thus yields an almost perfect gaussian photometric noise .",
    "we obtained the temporal power spectrum of this photometric noise in the light curve , finding a near power - law red spectrum of @xmath199 . for the quasar strong lensing systems , the variation in the light curve due to transient weak lensing can be of the order of @xmath0 , depending on the halo models .",
    "in contrast , the intrinsic variations of quasar light can be as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "however , we have argued that , in principle , we can separate the intrinsic variation of quasars from the transient weak lensing by the time delay method for multiple images in a strong lensing systems .",
    "moreover , we showed that the primary contamination of this signal by stellar microlensing can be effectively cleaned , as it has a significantly different amplitude , statistics , and frequency dependence .",
    "finally , for the observation of transient weak lensing we proposed monitoring images of quasars in a strong lensing system , preferably lensed with a cluster of galaxies . amongst bright lensed quasars in the sdss data release 7 , sdssj1004 + 4112",
    "is lensed by cluster of galaxy with images formed at large angle separation .",
    "the advantage of using strong lensing system is that ( i ) we can remove the intrinsic variations of a quasar by time delay method and ( ii ) the transient weak lensing signals can be enhanced by the magnification of the source due to the strong lensing . for the case of stable clustering , we calculated an exposure time of @xmath231 sec with a 10-meter class telescope to achieve @xmath221 signal to noise ratio in detection of time variation by the transient weak lensing . a long term monitoring of this system is therefore proposed as a means to study the nature of dark matter microhaloes on the cosmological scales .",
    "the result of observations , either will constrain the existence of microhaloes , or rule them out as the building blocks of dark matter structures in favour of modified gravity alternatives , or more conservatively , a breakdown in cdm hierarchy on small scales .",
    "we would like to especially thank avery broderick for reminding us about the power of multiple - image strong lensing for differentiating our signal from intrinsic quasar variability .",
    "we would also like to thank adrienne erickcek , neal dalal , and james taylor for invaluable discussions and/or feedback on the manuscript .",
