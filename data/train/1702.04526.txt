    "while it has been established that neutrinos are massive due to the discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite , their precise properties , such as their complete mixing parameters and their being dirac or majorana , however are still under active investigation .",
    "an analogous ( and even more perplexing ) story applies to dm whose nature remains unknown despite the ever - growing evidence for its existence from the astrophysical observables .",
    "an intriguing possibility regarding these mysteries would be to introduce rhns which can address the origin of neutrino masses and act as dm , and their importance can well go beyond the dm and neutrino physics including their potential roles in the inflation and baryon asymmetry production @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we seek a possibility for a sterile rhn to make up the whole dm in the universe and , in particular , propose the new production mechanism of sterile rhn dm through the mixing among rhns .",
    "our production mechanism differs from the conventional active - sterile neutrino oscillation production where sterile rhn dm is produced due to its mixing with left - hand neutrinos .",
    "those production mechanisms requiring the sterile rhn dm to couple to left - handed neutrinos are known to suffer from the sever tension between the upper dm mass bound from the x - ray data and the lower mass bound from the small - scale structure data @xcite .",
    "these astrophysical constraints on the sterile rhn dm heavily depend on their production mechanisms and many possibilities have been explored to produce the desired sterile rhn dm abundance in addition to the conventional non - resonant / resonant active - sterile neutrino conversion mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the examples include the rhn production from heavier particle decays , by the freeze - in and by the freeze - out accompanied by the entropy dilution , and these alternative production mechanisms typically involve the additional fields besides rhns .",
    "our scenario does not introduce any additional fields besides rhns which naturally show up in a simple extension of the sm to account for the neutrino masses .",
    "the tight x - ray and dm lifetime bounds on the dm mass can be evaded because our scenario does not necessarily require dm mixing with sm neutrinos and the desirable sterile rhn dm abundance can be realized for both warm and cold dm mass ranges .",

    "<S> we propose a scenario where sterile neutrino ( either warm or cold ) dark matter ( dm ) is produced through ( non - resonant ) oscillations among right - handed neutrinos ( rhns ) and can constitute the whole dm in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we study this production mechanism in a simple setup with three rhns , where the lightest rhn can be sterile neutrino dm whose mixing with left - handed neutrinos is sufficiently small while heavier rhns can have non - negligible mixings with left - handed neutrinos to explain the neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that , in our scenario , the production of sterile rhn dm from the decay of a heavier rhn is subdominant compared with the rhn oscillation production due to the x - ray and small scale structure constraints . </S>"
