    "in recent times many models have been proposed to study the dynamics of granular materials like sand in different practical situations ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview ) . in many applications",
    "one has to store this kind of materials in view of their later use , so that filling and emptying a container are crucial processes .",
    "granular materials adapt their shape to the container ( like a fluid does ) , but in general the free surface of a heap strongly depends on its formation process , for example on intensity and dislocation of the source .",
    "moreover , the pressure on the bottom of the structure does not grow linearly with the height of the pile , since part of it is released against the walls through arcs of grains , a fact that can even produce silos explosion and collapse .",
    "in this paper we deal with the simple problem of pouring at low intensity granular matter into a silo of given cross - section @xmath0 : it is known from the experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) that if the source is independent of time , the free surface of the growing heap evolves towards a well - defined profile which then retains its shape while growing with a constant velocity .    the two - layer model of hadeler and kuttler @xcite , which basically describes the formation of sandpiles over an open bounded plane table , is a system of two partial differential equations for a standing layer @xmath1 and a small rolling layer @xmath2 of grains running down the slope .",
    "it can be adapted in a natural way to the case of the silo problem ( see again @xcite and more specifically @xcite ) by adding a suitable boundary condition on the silo walls . if @xmath3 denotes the vertical source of material and @xmath4 the final time , then the model takes the form @xmath5 the nonlinear term which appears in both the equations with opposite sign expresses the exchange term between the two layers , @xmath6 being the maximal ( _ critical _ ) slope that the material can support without flowing down , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively the mobility and the collision rate parameters .",
    "the boundary condition comes from the total mass conservation law ( when @xmath9 ) , which suggests @xmath10 but the first equation in ( [ hk ] ) is an advection equation for @xmath2 in the direction of @xmath11 , so that boundary conditions can not be imposed for the outgoing direction of its flow and condition ( [ bc ] ) reduces to a pure homogeneous neumann condition on @xmath1 .",
    "existence and uniqueness results for the solution of a system similar to ( [ hk ] ) under general assumptions on the data has been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "if the source is constant in time the free profile is expected to evolve towards a _",
    "similarity solution _ , according to the following definition .",
    "we call a pair of functions @xmath12 a similarity solution of system ( [ hk ] ) in @xmath13 if there exists a positive constant @xmath14 such that the functions @xmath15 solve the system ( disregarding the initial condition ) .",
    "it can be considered as a sort of equilibrium for the model : the rolling layer is constant in time , while the free surface keeps growing by a rigid traslation of its shape at a constant rate @xmath14 .    in the toy one - dimensional ( 1d )",
    "case for the cross - section , these quasi - stationary profiles @xmath16 can be expressed by closed integral formulas ( see @xcite and next section ) in terms of the source and of the other problem parameters . in two dimensions ( 2d )",
    "it can be proved that similarity solutions exist , but their expressions are known only in special cases .",
    "that is why in section 3 we discuss a finite element ( fe ) characterization of such solutions in the general case .",
    "finite difference ( fd ) numerical schemes for the model of hadeler and kuttler have been studied in @xcite and @xcite in the case of growing sandpiles on a bounded open table , and in @xcite on a table partially bounded by vertical walls . in section  4 we will adapt such schemes to the present problem of silos in order to show through the experiments of section 5 that the growing heaps generated by the evolving model perfectly match the similarity solutions .",
    "we recall the basic theorem of existence for similarity solutions in the case of a constant in time source term .",
    "( @xcite ) assume @xmath17 ; then there exists a similarity solution @xmath16 for problem ( [ hk ] ) ( in the sense of definition 1 ) , with @xmath18 unique up to an additive constant and @xmath19    the main idea in the proof is to consider the basic properties of the flux function @xmath20 . if one looks for it in the form of a gradient ( @xmath21 ) , then its potential @xmath22 should solve the semidefinite neumann problem for the laplacian @xmath23 with @xmath24 , which has a solution ( unique up to an additive constant ) due to the zero - mean property of @xmath25",
    ". then we can derive @xmath26 from @xmath22 , and also deduce : @xmath27 so that @xmath18 can be determined up to an additive constant .",
    "formula ( [ vel ] ) says that the growth velocity of the similarity profile coincides with the average precipitation , that is with the mean value of the source intensity and is independent from the other parameters .",
    "theorem 1 does not say anything about uniqueness : in principle other solution pairs @xmath16 could exist such that @xmath28 is not a gradient . anyway , numerical experiments of section 5 show that the solutions given by the previous theorem are the only significant ( physical ) ones , since the evolving profiles tend asymptotically to them .",
    "+ in 1d the previous result yields explicit expressions for similarity solutions .",
    "if for example @xmath13 coincides with the interval @xmath29 , one finds ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 such expressions give several informations about solutions :    * if @xmath32 for any @xmath33 , then @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that is the free surface grows remaining flat , as expected ; * if the source is not identically zero , then @xmath37 everywhere , even at the boundary , confirming what already stated about condition ( [ bc ] ) ;",
    "* @xmath38 , that is the standing layer never exceeds the critical slope ; * the rolling layer thickness is directly proportional to the source intensity and inversely proportional to @xmath6 .    in higher dimensions",
    "explicit formulas for similarity solutions can not be deduced in general , and we will see in the next section how to detect them numerically . here",
    "we just report the two special cases of a central point source , for 1d and 2d radial cross - sections respectively , where similarity solutions can be explicitly computed .",
    "* example 1.*(@xcite ) assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 denotes the usual dirac function centered in @xmath42 ) , that is there is a point source placed over the middle of the silo .",
    "similarity solutions then take the form ( see figure [ sol1ddelta ] ) : @xmath43 @xmath44    * example 2.*(@xcite ) let @xmath45 be the ball of radius @xmath46 centered at the origin , and @xmath47 a point source over its center ; then similarity solutions are radial functions , and radial symmetry arguments yields ( see figure [ sol3d ] ) : @xmath48    previous examples show that the typical profile of a growing symmetric heap of grains in a silo under the effect of a central source is different from the classical conical shape which would emerge on an open table without walls . in both dimensions",
    "the standing layer now assumes a strictly convex ( logarithmic ) profile",
    ". the maximal slope of the pile changes instead with the dimension : in 2d it is reached right in the center , and coincides with the critical slope @xmath6 , whereas in 1d it depends on the parameters @xmath49 and on the size @xmath50 of the container .",
    "in particular , when the ratio @xmath51 ( grains roll slowly and are easily trapped ) the slope of the pile always remains very close to the critical angle @xmath6 . on the contrary , when @xmath52 is large the grains move very fast from the beginning , and larger variations of the slope can emerge .    for what concerns the rolling layer in 2d , figure [ sol3d ] shows the emergence of a singularity in the center , in accordance with the fact that its expression comes from the solution of a potential problem with a central dirac source .",
    "for the sake of simplicity from now on we assume @xmath53 .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 in the previous section shows that in order to characterize the similarity profiles one needs to solve in @xmath13 the elliptic neumann problem ( [ neum ] ) . from a numerical point of view , this can be done for example by using a finite element approach .",
    "if @xmath54 denotes a regular triangulation of @xmath13 of size @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the finite element spaces of respectively piecewise linear and piecewise constant functions on @xmath54 , galerkin method requires to solve the discrete variational problem@xmath58 however , if @xmath13 is not a polygonal domain it has to be replaced in ( [ discr_neum ] ) by a suitable set @xmath59 defined as the union of the triangular elements of @xmath54 ; @xmath59 will be closed to @xmath13 , but in general the right - hand side @xmath25 will not retain its zero - mean property on @xmath59 , and the discrete semidefinite problem will not be solvable at all . a way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to replace @xmath25 in ( [ discr_neum ] ) by the function @xmath60 , with @xmath61 by construction , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for any @xmath64 , so that ( [ discr_neum ] ) becomes solvable ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "then by definition @xmath65 will be a piecewise constant vector on @xmath54 , and its norm an element of the discrete space @xmath66 .",
    "hence , from ( [ vfromw ] ) , @xmath67 now , since @xmath68 , the gradient of @xmath69 on any triangle @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 it remains to compute @xmath72 . in 1d its value at any node @xmath73 can be determined by direct integration of the piecewise constant function @xmath74 from 0 to @xmath75 ( which corresponds to choose the particular solution vanishing at the origin ) : @xmath76 in higher dimension a different strategy can be used : plugging @xmath77 into ( [ discr_neum ] ) , @xmath69 becomes the solution of the discrete variational neumann problem ( with @xmath78 given ) @xmath79",
    "in this section we want to show that the previously characterized similarity solutions asymptotically arise as profiles of the growing heaps in the dynamic process of filling the silo . in order to do that we implemented a numerical scheme for the complete system ( [ hk ] ) , adapting to this case the finite difference scheme used in @xcite for the growing sandpiles .    in 1d , if @xmath39 and @xmath80 denotes the space discretization step , a uniform mesh is described by the nodes @xmath81 , for @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 is the time step , our explicit scheme reads for the internal nodes @xmath84 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 denote respectively the approximate values at time @xmath87 in @xmath75 of the solutions @xmath88 and of the upwind flux derivative @xmath89 in the direction determined by the sign of @xmath90 , that is @xmath91 ( in each node the spatial derivative @xmath90 is defined as the term of maximal absolute value between the backward and the forward first differences ) . to complete the scheme we added initial conditions ( @xmath92 ) and boundary terms induced by the neumann condition on @xmath1 .",
    "the extension of this approach to the 2d case is straightforward if we restrict ourselves to square or rectangular cross - sections for the silo .",
    "it is enough to decompose the flux term as @xmath93 , and to repeat the 1d approach in each direction .    in order to study the asymptotic behavior of the growing heaps , in the numerical tests the scheme was stopped when the relative growth per iteration of the standing layer resulted approximately the same at each node , revealing the emergence of a similarity profile .",
    "such profile was then translated to the base of the silo and compared with the computed similarity solution .",
    "for the 1d cross - section case we assumed @xmath94 and tested different choices of the source term @xmath3 . in each example",
    ", for a given uniform partition ( of step @xmath64 ) of @xmath13 , we compared the exact similarity solutions given by formulas ( [ sim1 ] ) ( the couple @xmath95 , with @xmath96 ) , the discrete similarity solutions computed by the fe approach of section 3 ( @xmath97 , with @xmath98 ) , and the stabilized profiles determined by the fd scheme for the evolutive problem described in section 4 ( @xmath99 , with the first one shifted towards zero , that is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the iterate selected by the stopping criterion ) .",
    "figure [ grow1d ] shows three examples of growing heaps according to different source supports @xmath102 ( centered symmetric , close to the boundary , disconnected ) . in all the cases",
    "it can be seen the formation of a similarity solution ( in dot lines ) .",
    "we found first order convergence of the approximate similarity solutions to the exact ones for the fe method in uniform norm , and approximately the same order for the asymptotic convergence of the growing profiles computed by the fd scheme to the quasi - stationary ones . in table 1",
    "we report the values found for the symmetric centered support case of figure [ sol1dcentral ] .",
    "other tests gave similar results .",
    "note that the stabilized rolling layer is everywhere positive , with a small depression in the central region corresponding to the source support .",
    "when its length tends to zero one recovers the situation of the point source of example  1 , that is @xmath1 assumes the known logarithmic profile and the depression region of @xmath2 disappears .       in the more realistic case of a spatial silo , that is when the cross - section @xmath13 is a 2d domain ,",
    "the similarity solutions can only be approximated , so that we just estimated the quantities @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where as before @xmath97 denote the fe solutions of the stationary model and @xmath99 the fd solutions of the evolutive model after the stopping criterion applies , computed over the same mesh introduced in @xmath13 .",
    "we restricted our tests to the case of a rectangular domain @xmath13 decomposed through a uniform mesh , in order to use the same set of nodes for the two schemes .",
    "if for example @xmath106 , a mesh with @xmath107 equispaced nodes ( with @xmath108 for the fd scheme can be used as well as a base for a uniform courant fe triangulation over @xmath13 .",
    "the experiments gave results similar to those of the 1d case .",
    "figures [ cen2d ] and [ scon2d ] illustrate the results corresponding to a source supported in a small ball in the center of the silo or in the union of two disconnected balls , showing the profiles of the standing layers and the level lines of the rolling layers .",
    "the correspondence of the similarity solutions ( above ) to the evolving profiles ( below ) appears evident .",
    "figure [ riemp ] shows the growing heap in the square silo for the first example at four successive time steps ."
