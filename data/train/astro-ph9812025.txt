    "the measurements are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the observed cr @xmath0 ratio has been shown to be in approximate agreement with predictions based on the leaky box model ( lbm ) ( stephens 1981 ; stephens & golden 1987 ; webber & potgieter 1989 ; gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) , which assumes that the @xmath1 s originate from proton interactions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the @xmath1 s then propagate within the galaxy until they `` leak out '' by diffusion and convection with the characteristic cr galactic escape time @xmath4  million years ( myr ) ( webber & potgieter 1989 ; gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) . if the @xmath1 lifetime @xmath5 is not long compared to @xmath6 the predicted @xmath0 spectrum will be modified .",
    "the agreement of the lbm predictions with the observed @xmath0 spectrum has therefore been used to argue that @xmath7  myr ( golden et al .",
    "1979 ; bogomolov et al .",
    "1979 ; stephens 1981 ; stephens & golden 1987 ) .",
    "this estimated limit is based on early cr @xmath1 data and does not take into account the reduction of the @xmath1 decay rate due to time dilation , the effect of the heliosphere on the observed @xmath0 spectrum , or the systematic uncertainties associated with the predictions . in this paper",
    "we compare recent cr data with the predictions of an improved lbm extended to permit a finite @xmath5 .",
    "heliospheric corrections and systematic uncertainties are taken into account . assuming a stable @xmath1",
    ", we find excellent agreement between our predictions and the cr observations .",
    "allowing the @xmath1 to decay , we obtain a lower limit on @xmath5 which is significantly more stringent than current laboratory bounds obtained from searches for @xmath1 decay in ion traps ( gabrielse et al . 1996 ) and storage rings ( geer et al .",
    "1994 ; hu et al .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper improves on our earlier analysis ( geer & kennedy 1998 ) by including new data from matsunaga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "cpt invariance requires @xmath5 = @xmath8 , where the proton lifetime @xmath8 is known to exceed @xmath9 yr ( caso et al . 1998 ) .",
    "although there is no compelling theoretical motivation to suspect a violation of cpt invariance , and hence a short @xmath1 lifetime , it should be noted that string theories can accommodate cpt violation .",
    "consider a mass  dimension@xmath10 cpt  violating quantum field operator suppressed by the characteristic scale @xmath11 , with @xmath12 4 .",
    "dimensional analysis provides the estimate @xmath13^{2n-8}$ ] , yielding @xmath14^{1/(2n-8)}$ ] ( kennedy 1999 ) . for a given lower limit on @xmath5 ,",
    "the implied lower limit on @xmath11 is most stringent for @xmath10 = 5 . note that if @xmath11 is at the planck scale @xmath15 gev/@xmath16 and @xmath10 = 5 , the expected @xmath5 would be @xmath17 10 myr .",
    "hence , a search for @xmath1 decay with a lifetime approaching 10  myr provides a test for cpt violation well beyond the scale accessible at high energy colliders .",
    "finally , since the antiproton is the only long lived antiparticle that could decay into other known particles without violating charge conservation , a search for a modification of the cr @xmath1 spectrum by @xmath1 decay provides a unique test of the stability of antimatter .",
    "in the lbm the ism @xmath1 s are produced by the interactions of cr @xmath18 s ( stephens 1981 ; stephens & golden 1987 ; webber & potgieter 1989 ; gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a nucleus of charge @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is anything .",
    "our calculations use the elemental ism abundances given in webber & potgieter ( 1989 ) and gaisser & schaefer ( 1992 ) , and the measured cross sections for @xmath21 = 1 ( the dominant contribution ) given in stephens ( 1981 ) . for @xmath23 1",
    ", we have used the `` wounded nucleon '' results also used by gaisser & schaefer ( 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 s are assumed to propagate within the galaxy until they are lost either by leakage into intergalactic space or by @xmath24 annihilation .",
    "the dominant loss process is leakage .",
    "energy loss is included in the model .",
    "comparisons between predicted and observed cr isotopic abundances imply that reacceleration can be neglected ( webber et al .",
    "reacceleration is not included in our calculation .",
    "the lbm incorporates space - dependent diffusive and convective cr leakage into a single escape term with a single characteristic escape time .",
    "this picture is known to be too simple . a more accurate picture of galactic crs ( webber et al .",
    "1992 ) is provided by a two - zone diffusion - convection model which we refer to as the _ inhomogeneous leaky disk model _",
    "the model is based on a @xmath25 100 pc - thick matter disk ( radius @xmath26 20 kpc ) , with a halo extending above and below the disk by @xmath27 kpc .",
    "the crs diffuse off the disk into the halo by magnetic turbulence .",
    "it has been shown that convection driven by the galactic wind can be neglected ( bloemen 1993 ) .",

    "the ildm with these parameters @xmath33 has been numerically solved by chardonnet et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the secondary cr @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "although the ildm provides a more realistic physical description of cr propagation than the lbm , chardonnet et al . found that the fluxes in the galactic disk predicted by the ildm are reproduced within uncertainties by a modified lbm ( mlbm ) in which the momentum - dependent escape time @xmath34 is given by : @xmath35  ( 13  myr )  @xmath36^{-0.6}$ ] .",
    "this escape time is longer than that used by webber & potgieter ( 1989 ) and gaisser & schaefer ( 1992 ) and , since the @xmath1 flux is proportional to @xmath34 , raises the predicted @xmath1 flux and continues the trend of the last two decades toward longer cr escape times / lengths , as discussed by these authors .",
    "the uncertainties on the parameters of the mlbm result in uncertainties on the normalization of the predicted @xmath0 ratio but , to a good approximation , do not introduce significant uncertainties in the shape of the predicted spectrum .",
    "uncertainties on four parameters must be considered : ( i ) the storage time ( @xmath3767% ) ( webber et al . 1992 ) , ( ii ) the ism primary @xmath18 flux ( @xmath3735% ) ( gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) , ( iii ) the @xmath1 production cross section ( @xmath3710% ) ( stephens 1981 ; gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) , and ( iv ) the composition of the ism , which introduces an uncertainty of @xmath38% on the predicted @xmath1 flux ( gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) .",
    "we neglect the last of these uncertainties since it is relatively small . within the quoted fractional uncertainties on the other three parameters we treat all values as being a priori equally likely .",
    "note that the predicted @xmath0 ratio is approximately proportional to each of the parameters under consideration .",
    "the solid curves in figure  1 show the mlbm @xmath0 spectra for the parameter choices that result in the largest and smallest @xmath0 predictions . the predicted ism spectrum does not give a good description of the observed distribution at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "good agreement is not expected because the cr spectra observed at the earth are modulated as the particles propagate through the heliosphere , which consists of the solar magnetic field @xmath39 and solar wind ( stix 1989 ; encrenaz et al .",

    "the latitude - dependent solar rotation @xmath43 ( howard 1984 ) twists the field lines into a parker spiral . the smoothed heliomagnetic field ( @xmath44 5 nt at the earth s orbit ) declines as it changes from radial at the sun to azimuthal in the outer solar system .",

    "note that @xmath46 0 in the 1990 - 99 epoch .",
    "the regions of opposite magnetic polarity are separated by an approximately equatorial , unstable neutral current sheet .",
    "the sheet is spiraled and wavy ; its waviness is measured by the tilt angle @xmath47 , which relaxes from @xmath48 @xmath49 at polarity reversal to @xmath48 @xmath50 just before reversal . the wavy sheet locus in heliographic co -",

    "cosmic rays enter the heliosphere on ballistic trajectories and are then transported by drift and diffusion ( jokipii & kopriva 1979 ; risken 1984 ) .",
    "the transport model includes energy loss as crs perform work against the wind , cr solar wind convection , drift of crs across inhomogeneous field lines , and diffusive scattering by field turbulence .",
    "particles with @xmath52 @xmath53 drift in along a polar ( sheet ) route .",
    "since the polar @xmath54 is approximately twice the equatorial @xmath54 , particles with @xmath55 0 find it more difficult to drift in along a polar route than do @xmath56 0 particles along a sheet route . in the following ,",

    "the calculation is based on the heliospheric transport model of jokipii & kopriva ( 1979 ) , jokipii & thomas ( 1981 ) , and jokipii & davila ( 1981 ) , but that model has been updated with _",

    "the improvements include the latitude - dependent @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "the calculation is simplified by ignoring diffusion where its effects on the @xmath0 ratio are small , which for our energy range means everywhere except across the sheet ( jokipii & thomas 1981 ) .",
    "the effects of diffusion away from the sheet are essential for particles with energies below the range we are considering . for particles with speed @xmath59 the across - sheet diffusion coefficient @xmath60 = @xmath61  m@xmath31/sec@xmath62[b_\\oplus /b(r)](p/{\\rm gev})^{1/3}(v / c)$ ] is used ( smith et al .",
    "1995 ; marsden et al .",
    "the implied field fluctuation spectral index is the kolmogorov value of 5/3 .",
    "the modulated fluxes at earth depend only weakly on @xmath60 in our energy range , for this and larger values of @xmath60 .",
    "we use the data sets recorded by the mass91 , imax , bess , and caprice experiments ( table  1 ) .",
    "these data were recorded in the period 19911995 , corresponding to a well  behaved part of the solar cycle for which the heliospheric modulation corrections can be confidently calculated . to explore the dependence of the predicted spectrum on the heliospheric parameters ( equatorial @xmath54 , polar @xmath54 , and @xmath63 ) we have computed the modulated spectra for 11 parameter sets ( f1  f11 ) that span the range of acceptable parameter values ( table  2 ) . using the central parameter values for our mlbm , and assuming a stable antiproton , the predicted modulated @xmath0 spectra for a fixed time in the solar cycle ( july 1995 ) are shown in figure  2 for each of the 11 heliospheric parameter sets .",
    "figure  2 also shows the epoch  corrected measured cr spectra , obtained by multiplying each measurement by the factor @xmath64july 1995@xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the predicted @xmath0 ratio at time @xmath67 .",
    "the factors @xmath68 , which are shown in table  1 and have been computed using the f6 parameters , vary by up to @xmath69 with the parameter set choice .",
    "the mlbm predicted @xmath0 spectra give an excellent description of the measurements .",
    "there is no evidence for an unstable @xmath1 .    to obtain a limit on @xmath5 we add to the mlbm one additional loss mechanism , @xmath1 decay .",
    "the results from maximum likelihood fits to the measurements are shown in figure  3 as a function of the assumed @xmath5 for the 11 heliospheric parameter sets .",
    "the fits , which take account of the poisson statistical fluctuations on the number of observed events and the background subtraction for each data set ( table  1 ) , also allow the normalization of the mlbm predictions to vary within the acceptable range ( figure  1 ) .",

    "all of the heliospheric parameter sets yield predictions that give reasonable descriptions of the observed @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "allowing for a finite @xmath5 , the heliospheric parameter sets with larger wind speeds permit lower @xmath1 lifetimes .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , as the wind speed increases , the predicted flux of polar  routed particles ( protons in the present solar cycle ) is depleted at kinetic energies @xmath70 10 gev , which increases the predicted @xmath0 ratio in this energy range . antiproton decay would compensate for this distortion in the predicted spectrum . hence our fits using the extreme parameter set f11 determine the limits on @xmath5 . under the assumption that there are no significant non ",
