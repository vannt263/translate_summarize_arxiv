    "the investigation in phase space of the properties of quantum systems contributes with a remarkable picture of those systems in which the states are described by areas in such a way that the emergence of diverse quantum phenomena @xcite appears as the result of the interference of the portions of these areas which overlap .",
    "the area which represent each state may be fixed from considerations in the context of the old bohr - sommerfeld approach @xcite , with the aid of phase - space distributions @xcite or using the wkb approximate wave functions @xcite .",
    "this last approach has the advantage of being more systematic but is constrained by the limitations of the approximation . in this paper",
    "we illustrate both terms in this sentence discussing the photon distribution of squeezed number states@xcite .",
    "the photon distribution of squeezed number states is parity sensible and present characteristic oscillations with increasing photon number until it decay and vanish for sufficiently large photon number .",
    "these oscillations which may be computed exactly @xcite are similar to the ones which appear for squeezed states which been discussed thoroughly using the phase space description @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate also how this approach may also be applied to the case of the squeezed number states .",
    "a first step in this direction was taken in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the main characteristics of the distribution are consistent with interference in phase space picture . here",
    "we develop with detail the wkb approach of the phase space picture to investigate how the parity restrictions may be enforced and under which conditions the approximation breaks down .",
    "the outcome is that the wkb approximation is not able to represent the last maximum of the distribution in the the high photon number region .",
    "this failure may be traced to to the limitations of the wkb approximation and not to the phase space picture which as we show below is still realized ( at least for high squeezing ) using the more direct scheme to assign the areas to the states which relies on the wigner - cohen distributions .",
    "let us begin discussing the wkb approximation for squeezed number states and its relation with the phase space picture .",
    "we work with the normalized one mode hamiltonian @xmath0 and denote by @xmath1 the eigenstates of @xmath2 and of the number operator @xmath3 with eigenvalues @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the squeezed number states @xcite are defined by @xmath6 given by @xmath7 ( we are taking the phase parameter of the squeezing equal to zero since the photon distribution does not depends on it ) .",
    "these states are eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath8 of the transformed hamiltonian @xmath9 which is shown to be equal to @xcite , @xmath10 alternatively the squeezed number states may be interpreted as the fock states of a related system with mass @xmath11 and the same frequency . for a more detailed description of these states",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the wkb wave functions for these states are given by @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a normalization constant .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is obtained from the equation @xmath15 and is given in terms of the classical turning point value @xmath16 by @xmath17 the phase function is given by , @xmath18 and the normalization constant has been written in terms of the period of the related classical motion , @xmath19    for @xmath20 we recover the description of the number states .",
    "the wkb wave functions are compressed by the squeezing in the same form as the exact states , @xmath21    we note that @xmath14 is a symmetric function and that @xmath22    hence the phase function @xmath23 satisfies the relation @xmath24 and one can show that the wkb wave functions satisfy the parity conditions of the exact states .",
    "@xmath25 again for @xmath20 we are dealing with the number states .",
    "the wkb wave functions are meaningless near the classical return points where they diverge . also we note that the approximation holds better for higher values of @xmath5 .",
    "the normalization of the wave functions is such that @xmath26 with the integral in the right term vanishing for large n.",
    "[ wkb2 ]     now we turn to the computation of the photon distribution of the squeezed number states within this approximation .",
    "it is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 using the wkb wave functions is shown that , as was suggested in references @xcite the probability amplitude @xmath29 may be expressed in terms of a phase @xmath30 and an overlapping area @xmath31 in the form , @xmath32    in this expression @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 and is shown to be the overlapping area between a circular ring of interior radius @xmath35 and exterior radius @xmath36 of total area @xmath37 representing the @xmath38 fock state in phase space and a deformed elliptical ring of equal area which corresponds to the @xmath5 squeezed number state .",
    "the phases are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the point where , @xmath41 as can be shown in figure ( [ wkb2 ] ) .",
    "we have then , @xmath42 from the properties of @xmath43 ( ec .",
    "[ pode1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath44 using ( [ ec1 ] ) and ( [ ec2 ] ) the probability amplitude is given by @xmath45 this result is in agreement with the form of the amplitude proposed in @xcite and in particular [ ec1 ] gives the correct parity behavior of the distribution .",
    "[ dfm3 ]    ]    the connection with the geometrical construction is obtained noting that @xmath46 is given by the shadowed area in fig.([dfm3 ] ) .",
    "then,@xmath47 where @xmath48 in the same way we have , @xmath49 where @xmath50     for a squeezed number state with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "left : wkb approximation .",
    "right : exact computation , title=\"fig : \" ] for a squeezed number state with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . left : wkb approximation .",
    "right : exact computation , title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig ( [ wkbpm52 ] ) we show the wkb approximation for the photon distribution of a squeezed number state with @xmath51 and @xmath52 compared with the exact computation .",
    "the approximation is faithful for photon numbers below the last maximum .",
    "the failure of the approximation presented in the last section for large photon numbers is related to the the breakdown of the validity of the wkb approximation .",
    "nevertheless as we show below it does not exclude the description of this part of the distribution using the area overlapping in phase space . to see this let us introduce @xmath53 to denote any of the phase space wigner - cohen distributions @xcite associated to the squeezed number states which satisfies ,    @xmath54    and @xmath55 where @xmath56 y @xmath57 are the wave functions of the squeezed number states in the position and momentum representations respectively .",
    "the photon number distribution may be obtained by integrating @xmath53 over the @xmath38-th ring @xmath58 associated to the number state @xmath59 which is the area between to circles of radii @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , @xmath62 for a highly squeezed number state the integral in the configuration space variable @xmath63 can approximately taken over the whole line @xmath64 and by supposing a smooth behavior in the ring we get , @xmath65 taking into account the parity of the functions we finally have , @xmath66 ^ 2 a_{m n}\\ ] ] substituting the values of the waves functions we obtain , @xmath67     for a squeezed number state @xmath51 and @xmath52 . left : phase space computation([ec22 ] ) .",

    "right : exact result , title=\"fig : \" ]    which is in an excellent agreement with the exact value as shown in fig .",
    "( [ pm52 ] ) in the particular case of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the agreement stills holds for photon numbers beyond the last oscillation where the wkb approximation breaks down .",
    "this expression also shows that for large squeezing the photon number oscillation are driven by the oscillations of the wave function in momentum space .",
    "we have computed the oscillations photon number distribution of squeezed number states within the wkb approximation making connection with the phase space description given in ref.@xcite . in this case",
    "there are four sectors where the areas overlap and give a contribution to the probability amplitude @xcite .",
    "we show that for high photon number the wkb approximation fails to describe the last oscillation .",
    "finally we note that a description in terms of interference of the overlapping areas in phase space may be recovered , but not based in the wkb approximation but in the wigner - cohen distributions . for large squeezing this prescription",
    "reproduces the photon number distribution for the whole range .",
