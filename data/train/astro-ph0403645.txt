    "there is now a wide agreement that most if not all galaxies with bulges harbor massive black holes in their centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , only a fraction of the galaxies harbor a quasar - like active nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "agns are often seen as compact sources in the nucleus of galaxies , with strong highly - ionized broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "they are thought to be powered by a central supermassive black hole , fed by the accretion of gas from the inner @xmath2100 pc of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "while both a massive black hole and a reservoir of gas are believed to be important for triggering high level agn activity , it is as yet unclear which conditions are needed to trigger such activity .",
    "fundamental questions remain regarding the relationship between the agn , its host galaxy , and star formation , the gas inflow rates needed to fuel the nuclear source , and the relevant fueling mechanisms on different physical scales .",
    "the morphology and spectral properties of agn host galaxies over different redshift regimes can bring important insights to these issues .    according to the currently favoured view , galaxy - galaxy interactions or mergers",
    "are important mechanisms for ( re-)igniting agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except perhaps for very low - level nuclear activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mergers and interactions can induce large - scale radial motion of the interstellar gas within the agn host , and trigger its infall into the inner regions to be accreted at later times by the agn .",
    "@xcite first proposed an evolutionary scenario in which galaxy encounters could produce ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , that would evolve into agns .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by several studies which found a large fraction of merger / interacting systems in the hosts of high - luminosity agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , @xcite have not found merger / interactions in their sample of low-@xmath3 agns . an important limitation of these previous studies is the lack of a well - defined comparison sample of inactive galaxies , whose data were obtained and analyzed in similar way to the active ones .    a severe practical problem for the study of the hosts of agns is the presence of the bright nucleus , which has to be carefully removed .",
    "this strong point - like source , as bright or even brighter than the galaxy , contaminates the host flux in all the areas covered by the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "it also reduces the snr ( signal - to - noise ratio ) within the host .",
    "this affects strongly the reliability of any morphological classification of the host .",
    "consecuently , ground - based studies are normally limited to low - redshift ( @xmath4 ) , where the typical size of the host is larger than the seeing disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or to wavelength ranges where the host emission dominates the agn ( e.g. , near - infrared ) , increasing the contrast ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the use of hst imaging has clearly increased our understanding of the host properties , reducing the effects of contamination from the nucleus due to the very narrow intrinsic psf ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , most published hst host studies were based on wfpc2 imaging with short exposures due to the high agn flux , with a limited determination / treatment of the psf .    an additional limitation of previous studies has been the sample selection .",
    "several samples have been selected _ ad hoc _ , for testing specific hypotheses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other samples are based on unclear selection criteria ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or are clearly incomplete and/or statistically small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases",
    "the images were not deep enough for an accurate morphological analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a few studies are based on statistically significant , flux - limited samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the results from these studies are limited by the lack of a similarly selected comparison sample of inactive galaxies .",
    "all these difficulties can be better addressed by the _ galaxy evolution from morphology and seds _ project ( gems , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where agns have been identified by the combo-17  multi - color survey @xcite .",
    "we have selected the 15 agns with @xmath0 from gems , coincident with the best studied redshift range for the inactive galaxies in that survey . using an accurate determination of the psf , and a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fitting technique ,",
    "we decouple the host and nuclear components in these objects , and compare the properties of the host galaxies with those of inactive galaxies .",

    "gems  incorporates acs imaging from the goods  project @xcite .",
    "only the first epoch coverage from goods  was used , resulting in images that are considerably shallower than the final goods  data , but also slightly less deep than the surrounding proper gems  tiles .",
    "the full gems  data reduction will be described elsewhere ( caldwell et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it comprises the standard data reduction ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , flux calibration ) , drizzling of the data from the original 005/pixel to a final sampling of 003/pixel , background estimation and variance determination for each pixel .",
    "as the deblending of nuclear and host galaxy components with two - dimensional modelling ( the main purpose of this article ) is sensitive to background errors , we applied an extra procedure to remove local background residuals .",

    "for the redshift range of our interest ( @xmath0 ) , this cut defines a subsample of 18 agns , and limits the uncertainty of the combo-17  redshift to @xmath200.02 . in a final cleaning pass of the sample we excluded , by visual inspection , those objects located at the very edges of the tiles .",
    "the final sample comprises @xmath260 agns with accurate redshift and good imaging , 15 of them at @xmath0 .",
    "most of of the finally selected objects have absolute magnitudes of around or just below @xmath21 , which for an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath22 corresponds to the conventional division between high - luminosity qsos and lower luminosity seyferts , @xcite .",
    "this sample allows us , for the first time , to study a complete flux - limited sample of agn hosts , with a similarly - selected and studied inactive comparison sample .",
    "we have extracted postage - stamp images of @xmath23 pixels size ( @xmath24 ) of the f606w and f850lp - bands , centered on each agn .",
    "the redshift range has been selected for several reasons .",
    "the main aim of this selection is that the f606w and f850lp - band sample two physically distinct spectral ranges . while the f606w - band always samples the wavelength range bluewards of the balmer break ( @xmath24000 ) , and is therefore sensitive to ob stars in the galaxies , the f850lp - band lies entirely redwards of this break , probing the old population of red stars in the galaxies .",
    "the f606w@xmath25f850lp colors will therefore allow us to explore the degree of star formation activity in a homogeneus way for the entire sample .",
    "the angular scales between @xmath26 and 1.0 change only by a factor 1.5 , and cosmological surface brightness dimming is not yet a major effect .",
    "therefore , this selection allows us to perform a structural analysis in a homogeneous way to all objects .",
    "finally , this redshift range coincides with the peak of the gems  redshift distribution , enabling us to access a large and well - defined comparison sample .",
    "in a separate article we study the host galaxy properties of gems  agn at much higher redshifts , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives a summary of the properties of the agns of our sample , including the combo-17  i d , the gems  tile of the analyzed image , the redshift and @xmath10-band photometry from combo-17  and the f606w and f850lp - band photometry from the gems  data .",
    "whenever available , we have used the spectroscopic redshifts obtained by @xcite in their optical study of the x - ray sources in the chandra deep field south ( redshifts in italics in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the spectroscopic and combo-17  redshifts agree within the expected errors ( for a full discussion of redshift accuracy in combo-17  see @xcite ) .",

    "figure [ z_r ] shows the distribution of ( combo-17  based ) @xmath10-band vega magnitudes as a function of redshift .",
    "there are various problems in the detection and restoration of the hosts of agns .",
    "most of them relate to the presence of the agn itself , a strong point - like source that , due to the psf , contaminates the host image .",
    "the level of contamination depends on the contrast ( the flux ratio between the nucleus and the extended component ) , the overall snr , and the accuracy of the psf determination . here , we present the method used to detect and characterize the agn hosts , and to estimate the uncertainties .",

    "the contours are plotted in logarithmic scale , starting at 10@xmath28 counts for the 1st contour and with a separation of 0.5 dex . ]",
    "an extensive study of the acs psf based on gems  data will be presented elsewhere ( jahnke et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . on the basis of this study",
    ", we find that the psf shape varies across the acs field - of - view , with pixel - to - pixel flux variations @xmath29  % .",
    "this prevents us from using a single mean psf for our analysis .",
    "we find that temporal variations are negligible compared to spatial variations .",
    "therefore , we built a local psf around the position of each agn , averaging the nearest 35 isolated stars within a distance of @xmath30 . in order to take the uncertainties of the psf determination into account for later image modelling",
    ", we included these uncertainties in the total pixel variance budget .",
    "figure [ psf ] shows the mean psf averaged over the whole gems field , plotted in both a linear and a logarithmic scale to show the spikes and substructures .",
    "we also show the variance map of the global mean psf ; each individual psf has a similar associated variance map which was used in the fitting process .",
    "a simple method for the detection of the hosts was applied by subtracting the psf scaled to the qso peak intensity : the psf was scaled to the central flux of the agn , integrated inside a circular aperture of 4 pixels ( @xmath31 ) diameter centered on the nucleus , and then subtracted from the agn .",
    "this method is very conservative with respect to the host galaxy detection since it implies , by definition , an oversubtraction of the nuclear component from the inner regions .",
    "it provides us with a non - model - dependent detection and a lower limit on the host flux . in order to quantify the results from this detection method we tested it using 200 field stars , covering a magnitude range similar to our objects .",
    "we find false detections of a host contributing more than a 10  % ( 5  % ) to the total flux in only 3  % ( 12  % ) of the field stars . here",
    "we will assume a _ hard",
    "_ lower limit of 10  % of the total flux for a reliable host detection .",
    "we expect no spurious detections in our sample of 15 objects with this adopted limit .",
    "applying this method , we have detected hosts in all the 15 objects for the f850lp band , and in 13 of the 15 agns for thef606w band images .",
    "the two objects not detected in the f606w - band , combo-17  50997 and combo-17  43151 , are both at a relatively high redshift .",
    "their hosts are clearly detected in the f850lp - band , being most likely compact spheroids ( as we will discuss below ) .",
    "fortunately , both objects were observed by gems  and goods , being in an overlapping region . in this case",
    "we have combined the images obtained from both projects , and applied the subtraction analysis .",
    "we have found some residuals in the images , especially for combo-17  50997 , coincident with the f850lp - band residuals by a visual inspection .",
    "however , they are still below the relibility criteria and we disregard these weak residuals in what follows .",
    "we performed two - dimensional modelling of the images to recover more accurately the nuclear and host fluxes , and to determine some morphological parameters of the hosts .",
    "the fitting was performed using galfit v1.7a @xcite .",
    "this software fits galaxy images with a 2d model , which consists of a superposition of parametrized fitting functions for point - like and extended sources .",
    "a fitting process then optimizes the flux scaling factors and morphological parameters such as scale lengths , ellipticities and position angles , by means of @xmath32 minimization operating on the original pixel data .",
    "the agn images were fitted with a two - component model : a gaussian function with a very narrow width for the nuclear component ( a quasi - delta function ) and a galaxy model for the host .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian was fixed to the average value obained from the fit with a single gaussian to the stars used to create the psf .",
    "nearby companions were masked before performing the fitting .",
    "we did not preselected a certain galaxy model ( disk or spheroid ) for our objects , since the morphological determination was one of the goals of this study .",
    "instead , we assumed that the hosts could be characterized by either of two single models : ( 1 ) an exponential disk @xcite for disk - dominated galaxies , or ( 2 ) a de vaucouleurs @xmath33 function @xcite for bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "due to the complexity of the problem , we did not try to decouple the disk from the bulge , which would have required a third fitting function into the model .",
    "we also performed a fit to characterize the host galaxy as a srsic function @xcite , which helped in establishing a morphological classification as shown below .",
    "the 2d fit provided us with a robust method to decouple the nucleus and the host , allowing us to obtain the fluxes of both components . for each model",
    ", the nucleus image was subtracted from the original image , to provide a complete image of the host , including its substructures .",
    "we have obtained the total flux of the host by direct measurement of this _ restored _ image .",
    "finally , we also performed a surface brightness ( sb ) profile analysis of the images , fixing the ellipticity and the position angle to the values obtained from the 2d fitting .",
    "the sb profiles were used to visually check the results from the 2d modelling . the physical scale and the surface brightness of the galaxies",
    "were estimated measuring the half - light radius ( @xmath34 ) and the sb at this radius ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "tables [ ltable_v ] and [ ltable_z ] summarize the results of this analysis . for the images of each object we list the model of the host included in the fitting ( disk , de  vaucouleurs or the srsic index derived from the fitting ) , the derived total , nuclear and host galaxy magnitudes from the model , the host - to - nuclear flux ratio ( h : n ) , the axis ratio of the host ( a / b ) , the position angle ( pa ) and the reduced @xmath32 of the fit .",
    "we also provide the magnitude derived from the peak - scale psf subtraction described above ( sub ) , the magnitude of the _ restored _ host image ( emp ) together with the half - light radius and surface brightness .",
    "density distribution of the differences between the input and the output magnitudes of the host galaxies for the two simulated models ( disk and de vaucouleurs ) , when fitted with three different functions : exponential disk , de vaucouleurs and srsic , as described in the text .",
    "the first contour encircles 90  % of the objects , with a separation of 20  % between each successive contours . ]      to understand the limitations of our methodology we performed simulations .",
    "we created simulated images that mimic , as much as possible , the real data .",
    "due to the large similarities between our f606w and f850lp images , we simulated only f850lp images , and translated the results to f606w by a simple zero - point shift transformation ( f606w@xmath36f850lp@xmath371.6502 mags ) .",
    "the agns were simulated with a two component model ( nucleus+host ) , plus noise .",
    "the nucleus was simulated by a scaled psf , using the mean psf shown in figure [ psf ] .",
    "the host galaxy was simulated using a single model , either an exponential disk or a de  vaucouleurs function .",
    "clearly this was an oversimplification of the true diversity in galaxy morphological types .",
    "however , most of our objects can be clearly classified as either bulge- or disk - dominated ( see below ) , with very few cases of ambiguous morphological type .",
    "the simple dichotomy assumed in the simulations is therefore appropriate for the purpose of this paper .    to reproduce the noise pattern seen in the real images , due to the drizzling process on the reduction ( caldwell et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we created the noise map in two steps .",
    "a first guess of the noise map was built using the noise - free simulated images , assuming a poisson distribution for the noise , and adding the noise due to the background and readout noise .",
    "due to the drizzling the noise distribution of the real images is narrower than that expected from poissonian statistics , and there are correlations between neighboring pixels . in order to simulate this noise pattern",
    "we smoothed the simulated noise images by a mean filter using a 3@xmath383 pixels box .",
    "then we combined this smoothed noise map with the original poissonian one , with different relative weights , until recovering the observed noise distribution .",
    "the final noise map consisted of 80% of the original map plus 20% of the smoothed one .",
    "we covered a wide range of parameter space in our simulations , going outside the expected boundaries for real data to explore possible systematic effects .",
    "the simulations range in total magnitudes between 18.5 and 25.5 , with a range of host - to - nucleus flux ratios between 0.1 and 2.0 ( @xmath3966  % of the total flux ) , and half - light radii for the hosts between 0@xmath4015 and 1@xmath400 ( between 0.5 and 10 kpc at the redshift of our objects ) . for each set of data we created five different realizations , based on different noise maps .",
    "we finally created a total of 1880 simulated agn , 940 pairs with similar parameters , but different host morphologies .",
    "the simulated images were created both by the galfit and iraf / artdata packages , without significant differences in the final results .    with these simulations we explored the range of parameter space for which our method could robustly reclaim the key parameters ( total , nucleus and host fluxes , host scale length , and the contrast between host and nucleus ) .",
    "we also searched for possible biases in the derived parameters , and we estimated statistical errors by comparing the input and output values .",
    "to place limits on our ability to differentiate between disk - dominated and bulge - dominated galaxies , we fitted all the simulations , like the real data , with three different models for the host galaxy : an exponential disk , a de  vaucouleurs function , and a srsic function ( with a free @xmath41-index ) .",
    "the total number of performed fits was 5640 .",
    "a detailed description of these simulations will be presented elsewhere ( snchez et al , in preparation ) , here we give only a brief summary . in all cases",
    "we find that the nuclear magnitude is recovered with higher accuracy than the host magnitude .",
    "figure [ simulations ] shows the distribution of the difference between the input and output host magnitudes versus the input magnitudes , for the different input and fitted models .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the best estimation of the host magnitude depends on an accurate assessment of the host morphological type .",
    "the error in total and nuclear magnitudes is always lower than @xmath20.12 magnitudes .",
    "on the other hand , the accuracy of host magnitudes depend more on the host flux ( snr ) than on other parameters like the contrast ( host - to - nucleus ratio ) , or the host physical scale ( for @xmath42 ) .",
    "the flux of the disk hosts is better recovered than the flux of the elliptical hosts for the same range of parameters .",
    "this is due to the acs psf following roughly an @xmath33-profile ( jahnke et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which makes it more difficult to disentangle nuclear point sources from spheroidal than from disk host . another reason could be that disk galaxies are less concentrated , and therefore , for the same luminosity , they have more light in the wings .",
    "the error of the host magnitudes ranges from @xmath20.05 mag for the brightest disk hosts ( f850lp@xmath43 ) to @xmath20.40 mag for the faintest spheroidal hosts ( f850lp@xmath44 ) .",
    "it has already been noted @xcite that it is not possible to perform an accurate morphological classification of host galaxies based simply on the goodness of the fit to either disk or de vaucouleurs models ( i.e. , a comparision of the reduced @xmath32 ) .",
    "the model fitting is dominated so strongly by the nucleus fitting that the derived goodness parameter is similar for both models @xcite . however , we find that we achieve a reliable morphological classification using the srsic index from our fitting and comparing this to the results of our simulations . in absence of the nucleus and without noise ,",
    "the srsic index should be 1 for a pure disk model and 4 for a pure de vaucouleurs model .",
    "the presence of the nucleus and the noise alters this result .",
    "this classification method was already used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ sersic ] shows the distribution of the output srsic indices along the simulated host magnitudes for the input disks ( solid contours ) and the input de vaucouleur spheroids ( dashed contours ) .",
    "the srsic indices are close to their input values only for very bright host galaxies and tend to become smaller as a consequence of the presence of a central point source .",

    ", we can see that between @xmath79 of the morphological early - type hosts are bluer than the red sequence early - type galaxies ( @xmath80% of the sample ) .",
    "the range depends on where we draw the line for including objects in the red sequence ( @xmath81 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only @xmath230  % of the host galaxies detected in both bands are clearly as red as red sequence galaxies .",
    "this fraction would increase to @xmath240% if we included the two hosts not detected in the f606w - band .",
    "we performed 1d and 2d kolmogorov - smirnoff tests on the color and color - magnitude distributions of the early - type host galaxies and the early - type inactive red sequence galaxies .",
    "the null hypothesis that both samples were drawn from the same parent population has probabilities of only 0.1 and 0.4  % , respectively .",
    "the standard ks tests do not take the errors into account . to determine the extend to which these errors can affect our results we simulated 1000 color and color - magnitude distributions .",
    "we add random values to the original colors and magnitudes following gaussian distributions with the width of the errors . repeating the ks tests on these simulated distributions",
    "we find that the acceptance probabilities of the null hypothesis are only marginally larger , with 0.8 and 0.5  % , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the distribution of early - type agn host galaxies is significantly different than that of the red sequence .",
    "however , as previously reported by @xcite there is a tail of blue , but morphologically early - type galaxies which is clearly seen fig .",
    "[ vz_mz ] . using a similar ks test , we find the color and color - magnitude distributions of the early - type host galaxies are actually consistent with being drawn from the _ complete _ sample of inactive early - type galaxies , i.e.  including the blue tail .",
    "the probabilities found by a ks test on both samples are 16.7  % ( 21.7  % ) and 39.1  % ( 34.1  % ) , for the color and color - magnitude distributions without and with the inclusion of errors , respectively . however , applying a luminosity cut at @xmath82 , which isolates the four most luminous early - type host galaxies , the color distributions are again markedly different , although due to the reduce number of objects a ks test would not produce a reliable probability .",
    "these objects harbor the four most luminous agns of our sample .    in summary",
    ", we have found that the host galaxies of agns are mainly elliptical galaxies ( @xmath2  80% ) , with @xmath83  % showing evidence of interactions .",
    "only @xmath220  % are disk dominated .",
    "roughly @xmath62  % of the host galaxies that are structurally early - type are bluer than the red sequence early - type galaxies , indicating the presence of younger stellar populations than that of the inactive early - type galaxies . taking into account",
    "the recently reported blue tail for early - type galaxies @xcite , their colors become more similar , but they still remain significantly bluer for the most luminous objects .",
    "however , they are structurally similar to red sequence early - type galaxies , which may indicate that they are dominated by an underlying old stellar population with only a small fraction of the mass involved in a recent star formation episode .",
    "the majority of previous studies of host galaxies was focused on host morphologies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they found that the qso hosts were mainly early - type galaxies , with an increase of the fraction of early - type galaxies with nuclear luminosity @xcite .",
    "the fraction of late - type host galaxies ranges between @xmath215 and @xmath235  % for radio - quiet qsos , and almost zero for radio - loud qsos @xcite .",
    "these fractions are similar to those found in our sample ( @xmath220% ) , and there is no significant change with redshift . in contrast , very few studies have focused on colors . @xcite have recently presented their results based in the comparison of active and inactive galaxies from the sdss survey at @xmath84 .",
    "they found that the host galaxies of both type 1 and 2 agns have younger mean stellar ages than inactive galaxies , possibly due to starbust or post - starburst populations .",
    "furthermore , @xmath240  % of their objects are blue _ pure _ spheroids , and they found evidence of recent interactions in @xmath230  % of their objects .",
    "their subsample of type 1 agns covers a similar range of luminosities compared to our sample .",
    "@xcite already noticed that the mean colors of the hosts of their complete sample of low-@xmath3 type 1 agns were bluer than expected , especially for pure elliptical galaxies .",
    "similar results have been found by @xcite , for a sample of low-@xmath3 bl lac host galaxies .",
    "their results are remarkably similar to the ones presented here , especially regarding the existence of a population of blue elliptical hosts .",
    "our results extend this result to early epochs , covering the last half of the cosmic history .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite did not find expecially blue colors for their sample of low-@xmath3 high luminosity qso hosts , based on the analysis of @xmath10 and @xmath85-band images @xcite .",
    "however , the fraction of young stars required to reproduce our observed colors would not produce significant deviations in @xmath86 color at low-@xmath3 because the red light from blue stars is small compared to the light from the dominant underlying stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show evidence for a small fraction of young stellar population in their spectroscopic analysis of the host galaxies studied by @xcite .    in a companion article @xcite , we have analyzed the host galaxies of agns in the gems  project at high-@xmath3 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we found evidence for significant uv flux from young stars in all the detected host galaxies , in a clear agreement with current results .",
    "it seems that the basic ingredients in generating a powerful agn are a massive black hole _ and _ an abundant fuel supply , as already expressed by @xcite .",
    "only massive early - type galaxies contain massive black@xmath25holes , and only galaxies with significant amounts of recent star formation have the required fuel supply .",
    "it is still an open question why these early - type galaxies retain enough gas to undergo star formation , and what is the relationship between the agn and the star formation activity .",
    "the correlation between nuclear activity and enhanced star formation could arise from an enrichment of gas due to recent merger events .",
    "the merger would produce the infall of gas needed to ( re)ignite the agn and trigger star formation at the same time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find evidence of recent mergers in @xmath220  % of our sample , a fraction similar to the values reported in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is not clear that this fraction could be considered as a significant excess of merging galaxies .",
    "the fraction of merging galaxies in the local universe is rather small , @xmath27% , based on classical studies like @xcite . but",
    "this fraction is known to increase with the redshift .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite found that at least @xmath239  % of the galaxies in the hdf - n and hdf - s show disrupted morphologies , reminiscent of mergers .",
    "therefore , if a merger is the cause of the enrichment of gas in these galaxies , this event must have happened long before the morphological relaxation of the galaxy , in the majority of the cases .",
    "galaxy interactions have been claimed for decades to be important triggers of star formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was also belived that mergers produce an enrichment of gas , and even minor interactions can trigger star formation due to the infall of gas , compression and heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , tidal interaction can trigger star formation that significantly affects the colors of the nuclear region ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a counter example )",
    ". this may well be the kind of effect we detect in our observations , where we can reproduce the observed colors with a small fraction of young stars .",
    "@xcite estimated the timescales of star formation induced by interaction to be @xmath88 myr , which is of the same order as the morphological relaxation time of @xmath89 myr ( depending on the scale length of the galaxies involved ) . since even a somewhat aged population of recently formed stars",
    "can still produce substantially blue colors in the host galaxy ( see the model tracks in fig .",
    "[ vz_z_tr ] ) , we may well still see the enhanced blue color while the morphological signatures of the merger or interaction have disappeared .",
    "another possibility could be that the gas was already present in the morphological early - type parent galaxy . as stated above",
    ", there is a tail of blue elliptical galaxies in the color distribution of early - type galaxies in the gems  sample  that is , morphological early - type galaxies with enough gas to undergo star formation . in that case a process such as a minor merger , which would hardly detectable by our current morphological analysis , could produce the infall of this gas into the inner regions .",
    "a completely different connection between agn and star formation activity could come from agn - driven feedback processes .",
    "the combined effect of the ionizing radiation and possible mechanical outflows trigger star formation throughout the host galaxy .",
    "the implications of agn feedback for galaxy evolution in general are still poorly understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that a minimum host luminosity appears to be required to produce an agn of given luminosity .",
    "this result has been confirmed by different authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the upper envelope of the nuclear luminosities shows a correlation with host luminosities .",
    "the widely accepted interpretation is that for a given host luminosity , the mass of the central black hole is given by the bulge / bh mass correlation @xcite , and that each nuclear source has a maximum luminosity given by the eddington limit .",
    "the spread in the nuclear - to - host luminosity ratio distribution would then be largely produced by different accretion rates , implying @xmath90 to range from @xmath91 to @xmath92 ( assuming a fixed radiative efficiency for all the objects ) .",
    "figure [ hn2 ] shows the distribution of the nuclear absolute magnitudes versus the absolute magnitudes of the spheroidal hosts for our sample ( solid circles ) , together with different samples of type 1 agns obtained from literature .",
    "we have taken the bulge luminosities whenever the bulge / disk components of the hosts have been decoupled ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xcite sample has been included for a comparison with another complete sample of slightly brighter agns , at a lower redshift range , @xmath93 ( open squares , 19 objects ) .",
    "we have included two well - defined samples of different families of even brighter agns @xcite , that include radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( open stars and open crosses , 19 and 14 objects respectively ) . the compilation by @xcite bundles a large collection of hst observations , but it is not , in any sense , a complete or well - defined sample ( triangles , 70 objects ) .",
    "finally we have included an x - ray selected sample of type 1 agns , from @xcite . despite the large dispersion ,",
    "it is clear that all the samples follow the same trend .    in this figure",
    "we have overplotted the expected locations for agn emitting at certain fractions of the eddington limit , assuming a luminosity dependent bulge mass - to - light ratio , following @xcite and @xcite . despite a few agn that appear to show super - eddington luminosities ,",
    "the distribution of points is in agreement with a maximum of @xmath94 .",
    "the mean distribution follows mainly the expected location for an object emitting at @xmath210  % of @xmath95 , ( dashed line ) , while @xmath290  % of the objects are confined within a range of fuelling efficiencies between 100  % and 1  % of the eddington limit ( solid and dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "there is no evidence that the upper limit to the nuclear luminosity at given host luminosity could depend on either the host luminosity or redshift .",
    "as discussed above , the mass - to - light ratio depends on the @xmath63 color ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at a given luminosity , blue galaxies are less massive than red ones .",
    "if host galaxy mass is translated into expected black hole mass , this implies that the eddington limit for the nucleus of a blue host galaxy is lower than that for the nucleus of a red host galaxy with the same luminosity .",
    "the eddington limit plotted in figure [ hn2 ] corresponds to a red spheroidal , and therefore , is an upper limit .",
    "as we quoted in section 5.1 , the blue colors of the host galaxies are most probably produced by a recent star formation involving less than a @xmath230% of the overall host mass . in that case",
    "the eddington limit would be @xmath20.3 mag fainter for the bluest host galaxies of our sample , which does not change the overall results .",
    "we have analyzed a flux - limited sample of 15 intermediate luminosity type 1 agns from combo-17 , at @xmath0 using the gems  deep f606w and f850lp - band acs images .",
    "we decomposed he host and nuclear components and detected the host in all the f850lp - band images ( and in 13 of the f606w - band images ) .",
    "a morphological analysis has been performed to determine if the hosts were bulge or disk - dominated objects .",
    "@xmath280  % of the hosts are spheroidal galaxies , and only 1 object can be clearly classified as a disk dominated galaxy .",
    "we found evidence for on - going mergers in @xmath225  % of the early types and @xmath230  % of the late type hosts .",
    "the host galaxies show a wide range of @xmath66 colors , indicating the presence of different stellar populations .",
    "we found that a large fraction of the early - type hosts , @xmath80% , show distinct blue colors when comparing with the red sequence inactive early - type galaxies studied by gems  at the same redshift range .",
    "the color and color - magnitude distributions of the agn hosts are significantly different from those of red sequence galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute mangitudes , effective radii and stellar masses of these objects are remarkably similar to normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of the agn in our sample seem to be located in _ young spheroids_.    we considered two different simplified scenarios that can explain the observed color distributions : ( a ) a single stellar population with a mean age of close to 1  gyr , or ( b ) a mix of an underlying old stellar population plus a small mass fraction in a young component .",
    "both can describe the observed colors well . on the other hand ,",
    "the early - type host galaxies are structurally similar to well - assembled elliptical galaxies , following the luminosity - size relation of early - type galaxies .",
    "this indicates , most probably , that the process that has generated the blue colors has not strongly altered neither the luminosity ( @xmath2mass ) and the effective radius of these galaxies . taking into account this result",
    ", it seems that a mixed population , dominated by an underlying population of old stars , fits the observations better .",
    "this underlying population would reflect the population of the parent galaxy .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with the results from the study of a large sample of type 1 and type 2 agns from the sdss at lower redshift @xcite .",
    "they noted the existence of a population of _ young bulge _ galaxies ( @xmath230% of their sample ) , in a state of post - starburst , and a population of even younger mergers ( @xmath240  % of their sample ) .",
    "recent results by @xcite and @xcite also found that low-@xmath3 host galaxies are bluer than field galaxies . while on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite did not find evidence for distinctly blue colors in their sample of high - luminosity low-@xmath3 agns ( @xmath96 ) , their color range is less sensitive to young stellar populations at this redshift ( @xmath86 ) , especially if there is an underlying population of old stars .    a possible explanation to the connection between nuclear and star formation activity in",
    "apparently normal elliptical galaxies could be an enrichment of gas produced by a merging process or the infall and concentration of gas produced by a minor interaction .",
    "since the fraction of merger galaxies in our sample seems not to be remarkably larger than in inactive galaxies , the merger / interaction should have happened in a timescale long enough to enable the galaxy to relax morphologically before the current agn activity .",

    "the host galaxy seems to be dominated by a central bulge , although both the residual and the host _ restored _ image show evidence of what could be two spiral arms .",
    "we have classified this object as an early - type galaxy , since it is clearly bulge dominated .",
    "it presents a nearby blue and compact companion , which may be interacting with the host . a possible bridge between the host and the companion is seen .",

    "we calculated @xmath65-corrections for the host galaxies by comparing them with galaxies of the same magnitude , redshift and colors from the combo-17  survey where spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are available for all objects .",
    "first , we derived the rest - frame @xmath63 colors from the observed @xmath66 . for doing so we performed aperture photometry on the @xmath24000 inactive galaxies in the gems  field at the same redshift as our objects .",
    "we split this sample of galaxies in different redshift slices , each with a width of 0.02 and stepped by 0.01 in redshift . for each slice we found a good linear correlation between the observed @xmath66 and the rest - frame @xmath63 colors .",
    "we computed linear regression solutions for the transformation @xmath97 for each slice separately , considering both forward and backward transformations and averaging the two .",
    "the rms dispersions were between @xmath98 mag .",
    "this provided a grid of transformation coefficients @xmath99 and @xmath100 as shown in fig .",
    "[ k_cor_0e ] .",
    "we then fitted the @xmath99 and @xmath100 relations with high - order polynomials .",
    "table [ tab_grid_colors ] provides the polynomial coefficients needed to reconstruct the @xmath101 and @xmath102 parameters and perform the transformation at any redshift . in order to cross - validate this set of color transformations",
    ", we compared the rest - frame colors derived in this way with the original combo-17  colors , for the input sample of inactive galaxies ( figure [ k_cor_3 ] ) .",
    "we found no systematic differences between both colors , and a spread of @xmath20.16 mag ( rms ) .",
    "we then created a grid of combo-17  @xmath63 colors and redshifts , with a separation of 0.2 mag in colors and 0.02 in redshifts .",
    "each grid box contained all objects within a color range of 0.6  mag and a redshift range of 0.1 around the central values of the box .",
    "for each grid box we found again a linear relation between the observed f850lp magnitude and the combo-17-based absolute @xmath13 band magnitude @xmath103 where the regression coefficients however depend not only on redshift but also on the intrinsic color .",
    "note that by using f850lp magnitudes at the mean redshift of our objects , we minimize this color term as we always sample the sed no far from the rest - frame @xmath13 band .",
    "the rms dispersions of the @xmath104 values around the linear regression fits are around 0.150.22  mag .",
    "we fitted the regression parameters with 2nd order polynomials as a function of @xmath3 , separately for each color range .",
    "table [ tab_grid_mag ] provides the coefficients required to derive the @xmath105 and @xmath51 regression parameters .",
    "again , we cross - validated this set of transformations by applying it to the combo-17  inactive galaxies , finding no systematic differences between the two ways to estimate @xmath104 , and a spread of @xmath20.28 mag ( figure [ k_cor_2 ] ) .",
