    "it is well established that the @xmath4-axis transport results from sequential _ tunneling _ of charge carriers between the cu - o planes that turns into josephson tunneling below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this intrinsic josephson effect was first discovered about ten years ago@xcite and has been a subject of many studies since then @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that no other examples of josephson tunneling that occurred in entirely single - crystalline media had been known until the discovery .    to justify commercial use of hts materials in power applications , the critical current densities of prototype cables",
    "should be sufficiently high .",
    "the bottleneck of hts - cable performance is assumed to be in poor inter - grain connectivity and bad @xmath4-axis conductivity of the material while the in - plane ( @xmath6- ) superconducting critical current densities , @xmath7 , are acceptably high . from both a fundamental and an applied point of view ,",
    "it is important to know whether the measured @xmath8 reflects the genuine properties of the material . in most cases",
    "however , the measurements of @xmath7 have been made on relatively large single crystals and thin films .",
    "those might include stacking faults and grain boundaries which obviously limit the observed @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , to correctly measure @xmath8 for materials with the highest anisotropy , like bscco , the current should be injected uniformly in every cu - o plane across the thickness of the single crystal , while any imbalance will lead to redistribution of current between the planes thus involving the out - of - plane ( @xmath4-axis ) properties .    in this paper , we present a method of measuring @xmath8 of a _ single _ @xmath0 ( cu - o ) plane in @xmath1 ( bscco ) utilizing its layered nature and the presence of the intrinsic josephson effect@xcite .",
    "we use an extended intrinsic josephson junction ( ijj)@xcite and a non - uniform current bias@xcite to force the current to flow along the topmost electrode of the junction , i.e. along the single cu - o plane . a distinct feature of the current - voltage ( @xmath9 ) characteristic of the ijj marks the moment when this current exceeds its superconducting critical value within the cu - o plane .",
    "the thickness of one intrinsic josephson junction in bscco is only 1.5 nm , which explains why it is difficult to isolate and study such a single junction . as a result",
    ", most results on ijjs were obtained from stacks ( mesas ) containing many ijjs .",

    "we can estimate the sheet critical current density of a single cu - o plane to be @xmath10  a / cm at 4.5  k. a back - bending of the quasiparticle branch followed by a reentrance to the zero - voltage state is also observed and is explained by significant joule heating at higher bias currents .    in stacks with many junctions ,",

    ", we can make a specified number of effective junctions enclosed in the base stack , including the most interesting case of sijj in this paper .",

    "however , the extra 5 - 6 junctions underneath the contact stacks may have a profound effect on the resulting @xmath9 curve due to joule heating , as will be discussed below .",
    "in the suggested method , it is important that the top electrode of the sijj is spatially uniform .",
    "one may argue however that the ar - ion etching is not sufficiently homogeneous to produce an atomically smooth surfaces after the etching .    to examine the surface roughness before and after the etching , the atomic force microscope ( afm ) is used .",

    "all these values are less than one third of the thickness of the insulating barrier layers between the cu - o layers ( 1.2 nm ) , which means that the etched surface of bscco is flat enough for forming a sufficiently uniform top electrode of sijj .",
    "the high degree of smoothness of the etched area is partly due to the low ion energy ( 230  ev ) and beam intensity ( @xmath20  s@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23  ma/@xmath24 ) used throughout the etching process@xcite .",

    "[ sijj]b . a three - terminal measurement is also shown in fig .  [ sijj]c for comparison , where all ijjs situated in the small stack under the current contact and the sijj are seen .    by examining the current flow through the structure",
    ", we argue that the sharp upturn at ( @xmath27)-point is due to the in - plane current flowing along the topmost cu - o plane of the sijj exceeding its critical value . indeed , when the bias current is spatially non - uniform for the sijj , i.e. is applied to one end",
    ", it first tends to distribute itself over the whole surface of the sijj s top electrode .",
    "this means that a finite in - plane superconducting current must flow between the current and potential electrodes , as depicted in fig .",
    "if it exceeds the critical value , the top electrode becomes resistive thus breaking the connection between the two parts of the junction .",
    "then , the current will be redistributed between these parts , dependent on their particular @xmath4-axis resistances and the resistance of the  bridge \" between them .",
    "the corresponding voltage measured at the potential contact will be a function of all the non - linear resistances involved .",
    "the highest in - plane current density is expected to be in the place where the small mesa under the bias electrode ends and where the bias current starts to spread itself along the top electrode of the sijj ( marked by a circle in fig .",
    "[ sijj]a ) .",
    "each electrode ( the small mesa @xmath28 ) occupies about one third of the total area of the sijj ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this means that initially , when the top electrode of the sijj is still superconducting , about one third of the bias current passes along the @xmath4 axis directly through the area under the current - bias contact .",
    "the remaining two thirds will flow non - uniformly through the rest of the junction area .",
    "it is easy to understand now that the maximum value of the @xmath6-plane superconducting current is roughly equal to two thirds of the total bias current .",
    "the ( sheet ) critical current density of a single cu - o plane can be estimated to be about 0.3 a / cm after dividing @xmath30 by the width of the sijj ( 5 @xmath31 ) . to be able to compare this value to the published bulk critical current densities",
    ", we need to take into account the total thickness of sijj ( 1.5 nm ) .",
    "hence , the ( bulk ) in - plane critical current density of bscco can be estimated to be about 2.0 @xmath32 .",
    "although being quite reasonable , this value is among the largest ever observed in other @xmath7 measurements @xcite .",
    "further proof of the method was obtained from another sample ( @xmath33 ) with two top electrodes of different sizes ( @xmath34 : @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 ) . by passing the current through two different top electrodes , two different values of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ma and @xmath40 ma ) for the sharp upturn structure",

    "[ ivc ] mimics the steep upturn of the measured @xmath9 curve and explains the upturn structure at low bias current qualitatively well .",
    "it should be also noted that at the ( @xmath27)-point where the break and the upturn of the quasiparticle branch are seen , the joule dissipation and , hence , overheating is quite small and can not explain these features . indeed , from fig .",
    "[ sijj]c it follows that the total dissipation of the whole stack is less than 50 @xmath59w at @xmath60 . using typical values for the thermal resistance @xcite , 40 - 70 k / mw",
    ", we judge that the temperature rise should be less than 4  k. moreover , any suggested decrease of the superconducting gap caused by heating should be gradual and the corresponding @xmath9 feature should not be sharp",
    ". however , joule heating increases with current and gradually becomes visible at higher bias currents , as will be shown below .",
    "as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ ivc ] , the simulated @xmath9 curve has no back - bending in contrast to what is seen in the experiment .",
    "in fact , the back - bending in the experiment is so large that the corresponding voltage eventually becomes zero at high current .",
    "we think that both the back - bending and the current - induced zero - voltage state can be qualitatively explained by joule heating in the region where the current is supplied to the junction .    indeed , the heat dissipation and , correspondingly , the temperature of the stack progressively increase with the bias current .",
    "the temperature dependence of the bridge resistance @xmath61 and its critical current @xmath62 should then be taken into account .",
    "the former increases , while the latter decreases with temperature .",
    "qualitatively , this means that increasing the bias current will result in a reduction of its fraction that is branching off towards the potential electrode . in other words , a smaller current is flowing through j2 for higher current biases . even if taking into account the somewhat compensating effect of the nonlinear @xmath9 characteristic in the @xmath4-axis direction",
    ", this can still result in the smaller voltage drop across @xmath63 .",
    "eventually , when this current becomes smaller than the re - trapping current for j2 , it will switch into the zero - voltage state .",
    "numerical simulations of the heating effects were done by including a dependence of @xmath50 and @xmath58 on the current through j1 , @xmath64 , since the small stack under the current lead is believed to be the main source of heating .",
    "the increase of @xmath65 and decrease of @xmath66 with temperature could be tested with different dependencies .",
    "the curve b ) in fig .",
    "[ ivc ] was obtained by assuming linear dependence .",
    "taking account of the real energy dissipation , i.e. assuming that @xmath50 and @xmath58 are functions of the product @xmath67 or @xmath68 and not simply @xmath64 did not yield much better fits .",
    "it is worth noting that in order to get back - bending of the @xmath9 curve using this simple equivalent circuit , it is essential to include the heating effects .",
    "no form of non - linearity in @xmath69 could help model the back - bending unless we included the dependence @xmath70 on @xmath64 , @xmath71 , as we shortly described above .",
    "curves resembling curve c ) of fig .",
    "[ ivc ] could only be obtained otherwise in most cases .",
    "one should not expect quantitatively correct results from these simulations due to the much simplified equivalent circuit used and also due to a somewhat uncertain current distribution in the base crystal below the sijj .",
    "the plane just below the mesa can switch to the normal state at sufficiently high current as well .",
    "then , the voltage drop will also depend on the geometry of base current- and potential contacts along the crystal surface . to take even this into account looks unjustified in view of the simplifications which were used .",
    "to see the @xmath6-plane superconducting transition of a single plane in higher stacks containing many junctions , one can drive current through the topmost electrode by applying the current between the two top electrodes and measuring the voltage on either of the contacts relative to the bulk of the single crystal , as is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ schematics ]    in the arrangement without ",
    "extra `` junctions , no voltage is expected to appear unless the in - plane current along the topmost layer exceeds the critical value .",
    "if dealing with the u - shaped mesas with a certain number of ' ' extra \" junctions , the voltage will be equal to the voltage across these junctions ( plus small voltage drop across the contact resistance ) .",
    "a feature corresponding to the current - driven transition to the normal state of the topmost electrode is a break of the last quasiparticle branch .",
    "the break is also accompanied by the appearance of an extra @xmath9 branch , see fig .",
    "[ break ] .    in this figure , an @xmath9 curve of a stack having two contacts on top",
    "is shown , with current directed from one to another .",
    "the voltage is measured relative to the bulk using another mesa somewhere else on the crystal surface .",
    "there are four quasiparticle branches seen , three having a common point of origin at @xmath72 and the last one having some offset both in voltage and current for the point of origin .",
    "the latter is marked by the thick arrow .",
    "we argue that this point corresponds to the current - driven superconducting transition of the topmost layer of the stack .",
    "let us describe the whole picture in detail .",
    "the bias current first flows through the small stack ( extra junctions ) under one contact , then along the topmost electrode and finally , through the small stack on the other end of the mesa .",
    "there are three extra ijj s under each of the contacts on top of a larger stack ( pedestal ) which contains four junctions .",
    "the latter can be seen in the four - probe measurements when the current is directed vertically down to the bulk and the voltage is measured at the second contact of the mesa , exactly as it was done in the case of the single - junction measurements , see above .    when the current exceeds the critical value for the plane , the current re - distributes , with one part still flowing along the plane , and the rest flowing right through the junction under the bottom of the extra - junctions stack .",
    "at this moment however , no additional voltage appears since that junction is still in the superconducting tunneling state .",
    "the current which is branching off downwards must become larger than the critical current for that  hidden \" junction .     in area measured in accordance with schematics shown in fig .",
    "[ schematics ] .",
    "there are three ",
    "extra \" junctions under each of the contacts seen as three first branches ( @xmath73)@xcite . the  pedestal \" stack contains four junctions ( @xmath9 not shown ) .",
    "the zero - voltage superconducting branch has a much smaller critical current due to the topmost ",
    "extra \" junction is in direct contact to the normal - metal thin film .",
    "the thick arrow marks the position of the break corresponding to the superconducting transition of the surface layer when the current through it becomes less than the critical value .",
    "thin arrows indicate current directions for tracing out the hysteresis in @xmath9 characteristic.,width=283 ]    when it happens , one more extra junction becomes visible , see branch  4 \" in fig .",
    "[ break ] .",
    "this means that in the case of ideally equivalent (  extra \" ) junctions in the small stack , the observed critical current for branch 3 should be larger than the critical current for the previous branches by the value of the in - plane critical current that is branching off towards another electrode .",
    "if the current is set to decrease after that , the hidden junction will not leave the quasiparticle - tunneling state unless the current through it becomes less than the re - trapping current .",
    "this means that when the _ total _ bias current becomes less than the sum of the in - plane critical current and the re - trapping current of that hidden junction , the system switches back to the state corresponding to branch 3 .    following this scenario",
    ", the critical current of the topmost single @xmath0 plane corresponds to the current at which branches 3 and 4 cross , see the arrow in fig .",
    "[ break ] , because the re - trapping current for a typical ijj is of the order of few tens of @xmath59a , i. e. much smaller than the in - plane critical current .",
    "given the width of the stack @xmath74 m , we calculate the sheet critical current density to be @xmath75 corresponding to the bulk in - plane current density of 4.7  ma/@xmath24 .",
    "the superconducting transitions of the second and even third from the top layer can be seen at high enough current as well . at high current however , the joule heating progressively increases and makes estimations of the corresponding critical current densities somewhat understated .",
    "we have argued that the sheet critical current density of a single cu - o plane corresponds to the critical current density which would be obtained in a perfect bulk sample .",
    "however , the critical current of an isolated superconducting plane in bscco should be limited by large thermal fluctuations associated with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) character of the cu - o planes .",
    "topological defects in the form of 2d vortex - antivortex pairs are likely to arise as a result of these fluctuations , as first suggested by berezinskii , kosterlitz , and thouless ( bkt ) .",
    "@xcite long enough vortex dipoles can be broken by the transport current and the resulting free 2d vortices will sweep across the superconductor giving rise to dissipation in the system .",
    "this scenario leads to a non - linear behavior of the @xmath9 characteristics since the number of free vortices obviously depends on the bias current .",
    "we can calculate the sheet critical current density assuming that the in - plane critical current is limited by the bkt - mechanism:@xcite @xmath76 = 5.8 \\times 10 ^ 8 \\frac { 1 } { \\lambda_{ab}^2 [ \\aa ] } \\sqrt { \\frac{m_{ab}}{m_c}}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the london penetration length ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the effective mass of the superfluid particle for motion in @xmath6 plane and @xmath4 direction separately .",
    "taking @xmath80   and @xmath81 , eq.[eq2 ] yields @xmath82 a / cm which is very close to the experimental values of 0.3 - 0.7 a / cm .",
    "this is also consistent with early suggestions on bkt - type phase transition of the layered hts .",
    "@xcite    still , the values that we obtain , are among the largest ever observed for bscco , both in thin films @xcite , single crystals @xcite , and tapes @xcite",
    ". remarkably , our results are even larger than for whiskers @xcite .",
    "whiskers are believed to represent the highest quality of bscco single crystals , having virtually no stacking faults and grain boundaries .",
    "such extended defects are anticipated to limit the bulk critical current . to the best of our knowledge",
    "however , the largest value of @xmath83 reported for whiskers @xcite is 0.5  @xmath32 , i.e. a few times smaller than in our experiments and than what can be deduced using eq .  2 .",
    "we believe that the failing to inject current uniformly through the whiskers cross section may result in large underestimation of the current density . in most cases ,",
    "the contacts to the whiskers were applied from the flat in - plane sides causing a highly - nonuniform current distribution@xcite .    the breaks in @xmath9 curves similar to the one presented in fig .",
    "[ break ] have also been seen in several other studies of multi - junction stacks of intrinsic josephson junctions@xcite . however , the authors neither commented on these features nor explained them .",
    "the position of this feature in current depends , of course , on sizes of the stack , the perimeter around it through which the current spreads out over the surface towards another contact on the single crystal , and on superconducting properties of the particular single crystal used .",
    "some geometries are especially favorable for seeing the break in @xmath9 s , like the case of having one stack placed on top of another one .",
    "this is the geometry of our experiment described above while similar arrangements can be found in other published experiments as well@xcite . in our geometry ,",
    "the current spreads out over the surface of the base ( pedestal ) stack through one - fourth of the square perimeter of the small stack sitting on top of the former stack , see figs .",
    "[ sijj ] and [ schematics ] .",
    "it is clear that in the case of a stand - alone mesa , the current of the break should be four times larger .",
    "the current - induced collapse of superconductivity of the surface layers can have a profound effect on several relatively high - bias tunneling - spectroscopy measurements on bi - family of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "these include the break - junction technique and the so called intrinsic - tunneling spectroscopic measurements , in particular .",
    "indeed , the large superconducting energy gap of high - temperature superconductors requires quite high current densities to reach the corresponding gap feature in such experiments .",
    "if the current exceeds the critical value for the topmost plane of the base crystal , an extra contribution from the `` hidden '' junctions or / and the in - plane normal - state resistance will add to the measured voltage . how large the false contribution is depends on the particular geometry of experiment but qualitatively , it is anticipated to result in overestimation of the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the sheet critical current density of a _ single _ cu - o plane was measured by forcing the current to flow along the topmost electrode of a single intrinsic josephson junction .",
    "the critical current was marked by a steep upturn ( break ) in the quasiparticle branch of the junction(s ) when the superconductivity of the topmost cu - o layer is destroyed by current .",
    "further increase of the bias current caused a back - bending of the @xmath9 curve followed by a reentrance of the zero - voltage state .",
    "this is explained by progressive increase of joule - heating at high bias .",
    "the values of the sheet critical current , 0.3 - 0.7 a / cm are among largest values ever reported for bscco and are close to theoretically estimated ones assuming a critical - current - limiting bkt nature of 2d superconductivity in cooper oxides .",
