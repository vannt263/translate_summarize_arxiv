    "topological defects such as monopoles , cosmic strings and textures , are predicted by a number of grand unified theories as a result of symmetry breaking and may have important comological consequences @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings , in particular , could be responsible for the creation of the density fluctuations needed for large - scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a tension or mass per unit length @xmath3 which is related to the temperature @xmath4 at which the phase transition takes place by @xmath5 .",
    "cosmic strings can meet and intercommute ( exchange partners ) or self - intersect .",
    "the latter process results in the formation of cosmic loops .    in the old cosmic string scenario",
    "@xcite it was envisaged that these loops gave rise to the density fluctuations responsible for galaxy , galaxy cluster and supercluster formation .",
    "loops decay primarily via gravitational radiation , giving them a very long lifetime .",
    "recent numerical simulations of cosmic string networks @xcite , while confirming that a scaling solution is probably reached , have shown that there is a great deal of small - scale structure on the strings , and that the typical size of the loops formed is very small compared to the horizon .",
    "since the lifetime of a loop is proportional to its length , this means that they do not live very long , and are unable to act as the seeds around which galaxies form .",
    "the dominant density perturbations must come from the long strings .",
    "nevertheless the loops could still have significant effects collectively",
    ". the extent to which they do so depends strongly on whether they typically break up into large numbers of small loops or reach a stable form that can survive a long time .",
    "it is difficult to analyze the fate of such loops using the numerical simulations of cosmic string networks , because they lack the necessary resolution .",
    "bennett and bouchet @xcite for example estimated that most loops break up into about ten stable daughter loops , but since the resulting stable loops are comparable in size to the resolution , it is unclear how far we should trust this conclusion .",
    "so it is desirable to study the evolution of loops analytically .",
    "several string parametrizations , corresponding to low harmonics ( first and third ) , have been analyzed for self - intersections  those of kibble and turok @xcite , a one - parameter family of cosmic loops , turok @xcite , with two parameters , chen , dicarlo and hotes @xcite , with three and finally delaney , engle and scheick @xcite , with five .",
    "the principal justification for limiting study to such configurations ( aside from computational convenience ) is the argument that high - harmonic components are damped either by the expansion of the universe , by friction with the dense surrounding plasma in the era immediately after string formation , or by the gravitational back - reaction , so that after a time loops become relatively smooth @xcite .",
    "however , we shall argue that these mechanisms may not in fact be so relevant to loop stability .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 plots are shown of the self - intersection probability as a function of the number of harmonics for the three cutoffs .",
    "it should be noted that the harmonic parametrization corresponding to a value @xmath6 on the @xmath7-axis on the figures corresponds to a @xmath8 harmonic string .",
    "the only parametrizations analyzed in this work correspond to strings with the _ same _ number of harmonics in each half .    in figure 6 a plot of the logarithm of the stability probability as a function of the number of harmonics for the three cutoffs",
    "is presented .",
    "the stability probability is defined as the probability that loop will not self intersect ( i.e. @xmath9 ) .",
    "the last six points do not have errorbars due to the fact that the lower value of the error is at infinity . as can be seen the stability probability @xmath10",
    "can be fitted quite well to an exponential curve .",
    "the dashed curve on the plot is given by @xmath11 with parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the continuous curve is @xmath14 with parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath6 is the number of harmonics .",
    "it is clear that in the high harmonic limit all loops will self - intersect .",
    "we have set out to examine the self - intersection properties of high - harmonic cosmic loops .",
    "after the very early stages of string formation , damping by the dense surrounding plasma , by the expansion of the universe , or by the emission of gravitational radiation does not have significant effects on the time scale of the order of the oscillation period .",
    "consequently , these processes are irrelevant to the question of how many loops self - intersect .",
    "we have found the most general @xmath18 odd - harmonic string in terms of the product of rotations and devised a means for finding self - intersections .",
    "the results agreed with all previous work on the subject , but extended it to much higher harmonics .",
    "we have systematically analyzed the resulting string configurations to find the intersection probability in the high - harmonic limit .",
    "we have found that as a function of the number of harmonics the intersection probability is well described by an exponential . in the high - harmonic limit almost all loops self - intersect .",
    "although loops have been found not to be as important for structure formation in recent numerical simulations of cosmic string networks as was once thought , they may still have significant effects , on the density perturbations @xcite , on the microwave background @xcite , on the gravity - wave background @xcite , and possibly on the baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "on the basis of our results , it appears that cosmic loops formed _",
    "after _ the initial string formation era by the mechanisms described in section 1 will almost all self - intersect within the first period of oscillation . as a result of the intersection process",
    "two or more kinky daughter loops are produced and , by the same line of reasoning , it is extremely probable that the daughter loops will re - intersect .",
    "it is not certain how far this process will go , but it seems likely to continue until the resulting loops have only a very few kinks , by which time they will be extremely small",
    ". clearly it would be desirable to follow the evolution of the loops through several generations to see whether they continue to divide .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "bennett and bouchet @xcite and allen and shellard @xcite found in their simulations that the size of most of their child loops was determined by the resolution of their simulations , _",
    "i.e. _ , close enough to the lower cutoff on loop size to suppress the chances of further division . in this work",
    "we have formulated loop trajectories analytically in an attempt to complement the numerical simulations made so far .",
    "we believe our method can provide a more definite answer to the question of the fate of cosmic string loops .    at birth ,",
    "the loops are already fairly small compared to the horizon .",
    "a sequence of self - intersection processes will turn the initial parent loop into tiny loops , with very short lifetimes , so that they will decay into relativistic particles within a relatively short period of time .",
    "this is likely to reduce many of the observable effects of loops , in particular their effects on density perturbations , on the microwave background and on the gravitational - wave background .",
    "but it might enhance the effect on the baryon asymmetry .",
    "here we desribe the implementation of our analysis .    when the number of harmonics for each half of the string has been selected , a set of string coefficients is randomly generated using the recurrence relation mentioned in section 3 .",
    "the number @xmath19 of points along the string must be chosen .",
    "it determines the resolution @xmath20 of the string in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , via @xmath23 . for consistency",
    "the resolution in @xmath21 and @xmath22 should be the same .",
    "it should be small enough to ensure that the small scale detail of the loop is not lost .",
    "the string is then time evolved for the given number of timesteps @xmath24 , with @xmath22 ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , the effective period . at each timestep @xmath27",
    ", we search for self - intersections by expanding the equations ( [ selfint ] ) to first order about every pair of points @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 ranges on the string will mean that there is another intersection at @xmath34 , so we only need to search for self - intersections in half the total range in @xmath21 . ] from 1 to @xmath24 , and @xmath35 from @xmath33 to @xmath24 and from @xmath36 to @xmath19 , as follows @xmath37   -{\\bf b}_{n}[\\cos(nu_{j})-n\\sin(nu_{j})(u - u_{j})]\\ ] ] @xmath38- { \\bf d}_{n}[\\cos(nv_{j})-n\\sin(nv_{j})(v - v_{j})]\\bigr\\}\\ ] ] @xmath39-{\\bf b}_{n}[\\cos(nu_{k})-n\\sin(nu_{k})(u'-u_{k})]\\ ] ] @xmath40- { \\bf d}_{n}[\\cos(nv_{k})-n\\sin(nv_{k})(v'-v_{k})]\\bigr\\}.\\ ] ] substituting for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 from ( [ uvdef ] ) and rearranging the terms yields @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47   -{\\bf b}_{n}[\\sin(nu_{j})-\\sin(nu_{k})]\\ ] ] @xmath48   + { \\bf d}_{n}[\\sin(nv_{j})-\\sin(nv_{k})]\\bigr\\}\\ ] ] @xmath49\\ ] ] @xmath50\\ ] ] @xmath51\\ ] ] @xmath52\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ] as can be seen this is a linear system of three equations and three unknowns @xmath21 , @xmath53 and @xmath22 , which is readily solvable by cramer s rule .",
    "an intersection is found when the conditions @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are satisfied .",
    "this makes the choice of resolution crucial to the accuracy of our results .",
    "the process is systematically repeated for every timestep until an intersection is found .    to avoid trivial solutions (",
    "_ i.e. _ , @xmath57 ) a cutoff @xmath58 has been introduced .",
