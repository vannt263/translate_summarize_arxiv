    "let @xmath3 denote the deligne - mumford moduli space of genus @xmath0 stable curves .",
    "our aim is to study the effective cone of @xmath4 . recall that @xmath5 is generated by the hodge class @xmath6 and boundary classes @xmath7.$ ] the study of effective divisors on @xmath3 has a long history dating back to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the most important result in this circle of ideas",
    "is the following .",
    "@xmath3 is of general type when @xmath8 .",
    "the idea of the proof is to write the canonical divisor in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are ample and effective @xmath12-divisors respectively .",
    "then @xmath13 is big and @xmath3 is of general type . in practice , we know that @xmath14 and @xmath15 is ample for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total boundary .",
    "so as long as we obtain an effective divisor @xmath18}b_{i}\\delta_{i } } , a , b_{i } > 0 $ ] with @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then we can write @xmath22 in the desired form @xmath23 .",
    "define the number @xmath24 to be the slope @xmath25 of the divisor @xmath26 .",
    "then the remaining task is to find effective divisors with small slope .",
    "+ in @xcite , the famous brill - noether divisor was shown to do the trick . recall that when the brill - noether number @xmath27 is equal to @xmath28 , the brill - noether divisor @xmath29 consists of genus @xmath0 curves which possess a @xmath30 .",
    "amazingly , @xmath31 , the so - called brill - noether bound , is independent of @xmath32 , and is less than @xmath33 if @xmath8 . for almost 20 years",
    "after the publication of @xcite , no one succeeded in finding any effective divisor of slope lower than the brill - noether bound .",
    "this led to the formulation , in @xcite , of the following slope conjecture .",
    "the brill - noether bound @xmath34 provides a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors on @xmath3 .",
    "the bound is sharp if and only if @xmath35 is composite .",
    "unfortunately , the slope conjecture is false . in @xcite ,",
    "farkas and popa study genus 10 curves contained in @xmath36 surfaces , or equivalently curves embedded in @xmath37 by @xmath38 s whose images are contained in quadric threefolds .",
    "these curves sweep out a divisor @xmath39 in @xmath40 .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath41 , which is less than the brill - noether bound @xmath42 .",
    "so @xmath43 serves as a first counterexample to the slope conjecture .",
    "recently , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , more counterexamples are constructed , and in these papers farkas also announces that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are of general type .",
    "+ the above results only tell us one side of the story , where slopes of effective divisors are concerned . on the other side , to the best of the author s knowledge , all effective divisors that have been studied thus far have slope greater than 6 .",
    "so in some sense , the slope conjecture is not far from the truth .",
    "a natural question is to ask :    is there a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors on @xmath3 ?",
    "a uniform lower bound @xmath46 for all @xmath0 would enable us to solve the schottky problem , which roughly says that the modular forms of slope @xmath47 cut out @xmath48 in @xmath49 , the moduli space for abelian varieties of dimension @xmath0 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "+ the idea to obtain a lower bound is to construct moving curves in @xmath3 .",
    "an irreducible curve @xmath50 is called a moving curve if the family of its deformations fills in a zariski open set of @xmath3 .",
    "we can define the slope of @xmath51 by @xmath52 . if an effective divisor @xmath26 does not contain @xmath51 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 hence , the smallest slope of curves in this family bounds the slope of effective divisors , since a divisor can not contain all the deformations of a moving curve ! along these lines , in @xcite , harris and morrison study genus @xmath0 curves as degree @xmath1 covers of @xmath55 for large @xmath1 .",
    "if we vary the branch points in @xmath55 , we just obtain moving curves in @xmath3 .",
    "the slopes of such moving curves do provide good lower bounds when @xmath0 is small .",
    "however , as @xmath56 , these bounds tend to 0 .",
    "therefore , the existence of a uniform positive lower bound for the slope for all @xmath0 remains unknown .",
    "+ the same circle of ideas is mentioned in @xcite . instead of using covers of @xmath55 , coskun , harris and starr",
    "choose canonical curves in @xmath57 to study . in order to get moving curves in @xmath3",
    ", they impose on canonical curves some conditions like contacting fixed linear subspaces with suitable orders .",
    "this method works pretty well for genus up to 6 .",
    "but the general case is hard to analyze since we do not have good knowledge about the geometry of canonical curves and the gromov - witten theory for high genus curves is far from complete .",
    "+ here we push the idea in @xcite further to consider covers of elliptic curves . take a cover @xmath58 that only has one branch point at the marked point @xmath59 of the elliptic curve @xmath11 .",
    "if we vary the complex structure of @xmath11 , @xmath51 also varies and its locus in @xmath3 forms a 1-dimensional subscheme @xmath2 .",
    "the geometry of @xmath2 is our main interest .",
    "we need to do three things as follows .",
    "+ firstly , we want to calculate the slope of @xmath2 . here",
    "we use a very classical approach originally due to hurwitz .",
    "he used symmetric groups to enumerate covers of @xmath60 similarly , the information of a degree @xmath1 branched cover of an elliptic curve can be encoded in a certain equivalence class of solution pairs in @xmath61 .",
    "we fix the ramification type of the cover by a conjugacy class @xmath62 in @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath63 . let @xmath64 also denote a conjugacy class of @xmath61 whose number of length @xmath20 cycles equals @xmath65 , @xmath66 . for two pairs @xmath67 , we define an equivalence relation by @xmath68 if there exists an element @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ". moreover , let @xmath72 denote the subgroup of @xmath61 generated by @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "define a set @xmath75 @xmath76 and its subset @xmath77 based on the conjugacy type of @xmath74 .",
    "then the cover @xmath78 corresponds to one equivalence class of solution pairs in @xmath79 .",
    "readers should bear in mind that for this cover , @xmath80 correspond to the monodromy images of a standard symplectic basis of @xmath81 . pick a loop @xmath82 around the branched point @xmath83 .",
    "the monodromy image of @xmath84 has to be an element in the ramification class @xmath85 .",
    "the transitivity condition imposed on @xmath72 is because we want the cover to be connected .",
    "see the following picture .",
    "+        let @xmath86 denote the order of the set @xmath87 modulo the equivalence relation , i.e. , @xmath88 when there is no ambiguity , we simply use @xmath89 to denote @xmath90 .",
    "let us further define a total sum @xmath91 and a weighted sum @xmath92 it is clear that @xmath93 and @xmath94 only depend on @xmath95 and @xmath85 .",
    "now we can state the main result about the slope of @xmath2 .",
    "[ slope ] @xmath96    note that @xmath97 only depends on the ratio @xmath98 .",
    "secondly , we have to study the irreducible components of @xmath2 . by using the symmetric group @xmath61 again",
    ", we can see that two covers lie in the same component of @xmath2 if and only if the solution pair corresponding to one can be sent to the solution pair corresponding to the other via a monodromy action .",
    "more precisely , define two actions @xmath99 and @xmath100 acting on the set @xmath89 .",
    "it is not hard to check that both actions are well defined for @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the group of actions generated by @xmath103 and call @xmath102 the monodromy group of @xmath2 .",
    "we give the following criterion .",
    "[ monodromy ] take two covers represented by two solution pairs @xmath104 and @xmath105 in @xmath101",
    ". then the points in @xmath2 corresponding to these two covers are contained in the same component of @xmath2 if and only if there exists an element in the monodromy group @xmath102 that sends @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we have to verify whether or not @xmath2 is a moving curve in @xmath3 .",
    "readers may already be aware of the fact that @xmath2 is more likely rigid , since a cover corresponding to a point in @xmath2 only has one branched point , whose variation along the target elliptic curve does not change the moduli of this elliptic curve . nevertheless , technically we do not need moving curves . instead , when the degree @xmath1 of the covers varies , as long as the union of all @xmath106 is zariski dense in @xmath3 , an effective divisor can not contain all of them .",
    "so the smallest slope @xmath97 in this union still provides a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors .",
    "luckily , for ramification class @xmath85 of suitable types , we have an affirmative answer to this density problem .    [ density ]",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath62 are fixed but @xmath1 varies , the image of the union of @xmath106 is dense in @xmath3 if and only if the number of ramification points is less than @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath107 .",

    "however , we check one case by computers : when @xmath85 is of type @xmath122 and @xmath1 is prime , it looks like that @xmath97 tends to 9 , cf .",
    "conjecture [ g3s ] .",
    "note that 9 is the sharp lower bound for slopes of effective divisors on @xmath123 , cf .",
    "+ unfortunately , although in principle by theorems [ slope ] and [ monodromy ] we know almost everything about @xmath2 , in practice it seems that the combinatorial problems we encounter are quite complicated , especially when @xmath0 is large .",
    "it would be very interesting to obtain more numerical evidences to see if this method does provide a lower bound for slopes of effective divisors .",
    "+ this paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we study the geometry of @xmath2 , namely we consider slope , monodromy and density .",
    "then we apply the results to the genus 2 case and several examples of the genus 3 case in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "a general method is introduced to express @xmath93 and @xmath94 in terms of some generating functions .",
    "then we study the genus and orbifold points of @xmath2 in section 5 .",

    "now , if @xmath135 approaches some point @xmath138 , the cover degenerates to a cover of a rational nodal curve , in the sense of admissible covers .",
    "hence , we can compactify @xmath137 by the space of admissible covers @xmath139 .",
    "when there is no ambiguity , we will simply use @xmath140 and @xmath2 instead . +",

    "note that this number @xmath93 equals the total sum @xmath142 defined in the introduction section .",
    "there is a natural map from the space of admissible covers @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "so it makes sense to talk about the intersections @xmath143 and @xmath144 by pulling back the corresponding classes to @xmath2 .",
    "now we can prove theorem  [ slope ] .",
    "we have to figure out the two numbers @xmath145 and @xmath144 .",
    "the former can be worked out by the following argument .",
    "we want to establish a diagram of maps : @xmath146^\\varphi \\ar[d ]   & s \\ar[d ] \\\\",

    "see the picture below .",
    "when @xmath150 is in @xmath151 , locally we can always construct @xmath152 .",

    "we abuse notation and denote their monodromy images in @xmath61 also by @xmath80 , and assume @xmath154 . now the key observation is that when the elliptic curve degenerates , the combinatorial type of the solution pair corresponding to the smooth cover determines the type of the degenerate cover .",
    "more precisely , the degenerate covering curve will have @xmath65 nodes at which the map @xmath155 is given locally by @xmath156 , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the local charts of @xmath152 and @xmath125 respectively .",
    "each such node contributes @xmath159 to the intersection @xmath143 .",

    "after the base change , @xmath176 and @xmath144 both have to be multiplied by @xmath175 , so the quotient @xmath97 remains the same .",
    "+ a fancier interpretation is that by using a minimal base change , we pass from the space of admissible covers @xmath2 to the stack of admissible covers @xmath177 where a universal covering map lives .",
    "this viewpoint is crucial when we study the local geometry of @xmath2 in section 5 .",
    "[ in ] recall that in our original definition of a cover and its automorphism , we did not allow variation of the target elliptic curve .",

    "so @xmath774 has the required ramification type .",
    "+    in @xcite , the square - tiled octagons can be of two types : one - cylinder type and two - cylinder type .",
    "the one - cylinder type corresponds to @xmath775 as in example 1 , and the two - cylinder type corresponds to @xmath776 as in example 2 .",
    "+ moreover , also in @xcite , it is shown that we can mark the 6 weierstrass points of @xmath51 .",
    "1 or 3 out of the 6 points are integer points , which provides two different parities invariant under the monodromy action .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath777 has at least two components . on the other hand , by our method using @xmath61 , one can check that 1 and 3 integer weierstrass points correspond to @xmath778 and @xmath779 respectively .",
    "+ for instance , in the first example , @xmath780 .",
