    "no direct observation of the universe during the period between the recombination epoch at redshift @xmath3 and the reionization epoch at @xmath4 has yet been reported . while a number of suggestions for the future detection of the reionization epoch , itself , have been made , this period prior to the formation of the first stars and quasars  the cosmic `` dark ages '' ( e.g. rees 1999 )  has been more elusive .",
    "standard big bang cosmology in the cdm model predicts that nonlinear baryonic structure first emerges during this period , with virialized halos of dark and baryonic matter which span a range of masses from less than @xmath5 to about @xmath6 which are filled with neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "the atomic density @xmath7 and kinetic temperature @xmath8 of this gas are high enough that collisions populate the hyperfine levels of the ground state of these atoms in a ratio close to that of their statistical weights ( 3:1 ) , with a spin temperature @xmath9 that greatly exceeds the excitation temperature @xmath10 .",
    "since , as we shall show , @xmath11 , the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as well , for the majority of the halos , these `` minihalos '' can be a detectable source of redshifted 21-cm line emission . the direct detection of minihalos at such high redshift would be an unprecedented measure of the density fluctuations in the baryons and of the total matter power spectrum at small scales , which will not be probed by other methods yet discussed ( e.g. cmb anisotropy ) .",
    "the possibility of 21-cm line emission or absorption by neutral h at high redshift has been considered before @xcite . prior to the release of radiation by nonlinear baryonic structures which condense out of the background universe , the spin temperature of @xmath12 in the diffuse , uncollapsed gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is coupled to the cmb , so that @xmath13 and neither emission nor absorption in the 21-cm line is possible .",
    "recently , attention has focused on the possibility that radiation from early stars and quasars might decouple @xmath9 from @xmath14 by `` ly@xmath15 pumping ''  resonant scattering in the h ly@xmath15 transition followed by decay of the upper state @xmath16 to the ground state @xmath17 into one or the other of the hyperfine levels ( madau et al . 1997 ; tozzi et al .",
    "this mechanism , it has been suggested , will operate on @xmath12 in the diffuse , uncollapsed igm during reionization , first to make @xmath18 , so that the 21-cm transition can be seen in _ absorption _ against the cmb , until the same ly@xmath15 scattering heats the gas shortly thereafter and makes @xmath11 , thereby causing 21-cm _ emission _ in excess of the cmb , before reionization finally destroys the @xmath12 . in what follows , however ,",
    "we show that a substantial fraction of the baryons in the universe may already have condensed out of the diffuse igm into virialized minihalos , _ prior _ to and during reionization . under these conditions ,",
    "collisional excitation alone is sufficient to decouple @xmath9 from @xmath14 and cause 21-cm emission in excess of the cmb , thereby providing a signature of the cosmic `` dark ages '' and of their retreat during reionization .",
    "the 21-cm emission from a single halo depends upon its internal atomic density , temperature , and velocity structure .",
    "we model each cdm minihalo here as a nonsingular , truncated isothermal sphere ( `` tis '' ) of dark matter and baryons in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium , in good agreement with the results of gas and n - body simulations from realistic initial conditions @xcite .",
    "this model uniquely specifies the internal structure of each halo ( e.g. total and core sizes , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , central total mass density @xmath21 , dark matter velocity dispersion @xmath22 , and gas temperature @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mean molecular weight ) , for a given background cosmology as functions of two parameters , the total mass @xmath25 and collapse redshift @xmath26 .",
    "the minihalos which contribute significantly to the 21-cm emission span a mass range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 which varies with redshift .",
    "@xmath27 is close to the jeans mass of the uncollapsed igm prior to reionization , @xmath29^{3/2}m_\\odot$ ] , while @xmath30^{-3/2}$ ] is the mass for which @xmath31 k according to the tis model ( iliev & shapiro 2001 ) ( since halos with @xmath32 are largely collisionally ionized ) .",
    "halos with @xmath32 may have radiatively cooled gas inside them which would add to the signal we compute , but such gas is expected to lead to the formation of internal sources of ionizing radiation which will largely offset the effect . since these additional effects are highly uncertain and are related to the onset of radiative feedback and reionization which we are neglecting in these calculations , we will not consider the role of higher temperature halos further .",
    "the flux per unit frequency , @xmath33 , received at redshift @xmath34 at frequency @xmath35 from a minihalo at redshift @xmath36 which emits at frequency @xmath37 is expressed in terms of the brightness temperature @xmath38 according to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the solid angle subtended by the minihalo , and @xmath41 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath42 is determined by solving the equation of radiative transfer to derive the brightness profile of the minihalo and integrating this profile over the projected surface area , as follows .",
    "the brightness temperature along a line of sight thru a minihalo at projected distance @xmath43 from the center obeys the equation @xmath44 where quantities are defined in the comoving frame of the minihalo , frequency @xmath45 refers here and henceforth to @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the total optical depth thru the halo , and the effective absorption coefficient @xmath48 is given when @xmath49 by : @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the einstein @xmath52-coefficient for the 21-cm transition and @xmath53 is the normalized line profile .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath9 is determined by the balance between collisional and radiative excitation and de - excitation by atoms and electrons and by cmb and ly@xmath15 photons , respectively , according to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the color temperature of the ly@xmath15 photons , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are radiative and collisional excitation efficiencies , respectively @xcite .",
    "the efficiency @xmath57 includes contributions from @xmath58 collisions , @xmath59 , and from @xmath60 collisions , @xmath61 .",
    "prior to the reionization epoch , ly@xmath15 pumping is unimportant and collisional excitation alone must compete with excitation by the cmb .",
    "this is only possible for gas that is highly nonlinear and sufficiently hot .",
    "such conditions are achieved only inside virialized halos . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the optical depth of an individual halo is not negligible , particularly for smaller - mass halos ( due to their lower @xmath9 ) .",
    "since @xmath9 varies with radial position inside the halo , as a result of its significant central concentration , we must integrate equation  ( [ t_b_full ] ) numerically .",
    "the face - averaged @xmath62 of this single halo is given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the geometric cross - section of a halo of mass @xmath25 and collapse redshift @xmath36 .",
    "the observed flux from an individual halo is then expressed with respect to the cmb by the differential antenna temperature @xmath65/(1+z)$ ] .",
    "the line - integrated flux @xmath66 received from this minihalo is equal to the flux calculated for @xmath67 multiplied by a redshifted effective line - width @xmath68 , defined by @xmath69 . for an optically thin minihalo",
    ", @xmath70 reduces to @xmath71^{-1}$ ] . in that case , for a thermal - doppler - broadened line profile , @xmath72(1+z)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we have checked that this approximation is adequate even for the optically thicker halos at the small - mass end of the mass function . the differential line - integrated flux @xmath73",
    "is given by replacing @xmath74 in equation  ( 1 ) by @xmath75 and integrating over frequency as described above .",
    "our results for individual minihalos are summarized in figure  [ 6panel ] .",
    "line profiles of different minihalos along the same line of sight should not typically overlap .",
    "the proper mean free path @xmath76 for photons to encounter minihalos in @xmath2cdm is 160  kpc at @xmath77 ( shapiro 2001 ) , corresponding to a frequency separation , @xmath78\\sim0.1\\,{\\rm mhz}\\gg \\delta\\nu_{\\rm eff}\\lesssim10\\,{\\rm khz}$ ] .",
    "these results predict a `` 21-cm forest '' of minihalo emission lines . at @xmath77 ,",
    "for example , there are about 160 minihalo lines per unit redshift along a typical line of sight in an untilted @xmath2cdm universe ( shapiro 2001 ) .",
    "detecting the stronger lines would require sub - arcsecond spatial resolution , @xmath79 frequency resolution , and @xmath80 sensitivity .",
    "ska is expected to have sufficient resolution for such observation , but probably not sufficient sensitivity .",
    "the average differential flux per unit frequency relative to that of the cmb from all the minihalos observed within a given beam of angular size @xmath81 and frequency bin @xmath82 is : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the comoving volume per unit redshift per unit solid angle , the solid angle @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we calculate the comoving density of halos at different redshifts using the press - schechter ( ps ) approximation for the halo mass function @xmath87 .",
    "if we define the beam - averaged `` effective '' differential antenna temperature @xmath88 using @xmath89 , then @xmath90 we consider the currently - favored , flat cdm model with cosmological constant ( `` @xmath2cdm '' , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , cobe - normalized , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) , for three values of the primordial power spectrum index @xmath95 , 1 , and 1.1 , using the primordial power spectrum of @xcite .    results for @xmath96 and @xmath88 are plotted in figure  [ tot_flux_z ] . in principle , the variation of @xmath97 with observed frequency implied by the redshift variations in figure  [ tot_flux_z ] should permit a discrimination between the 21-cm emission from minihalos and the cmb and other backgrounds , due to their very different frequency dependences . however , the average differential brightness temperature of this minihalo background is very low and its evolution is fairly smooth , so such measurement may be difficult in practice with currently planned instruments like lofar and ska",
    ". the angular fluctuations in this emission , on the other hand , should be much easier to detect , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath98-@xmath99 angular fluctuations ( i.e. @xmath98 times the rms value ) in the differential antenna temperature is given in the linear regime by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the rms mass fluctuation at redshift @xmath36 in a randomly placed cylinder which corresponds to the observational volume defined by the detector angular beam size , @xmath81 , and frequency bandwidth , @xmath82 , and @xmath102 is the bias factor which accounts for the clustering of rare density peaks relative to the mass .",
    "we assume @xmath102 is the flux - weighted average over the mass function of @xmath103 , the linear bias factor , where @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the value of the linearly extrapolated value of overdensity @xmath106 corresponding to the epoch when a top - hat collapse reaches infinite density , and @xmath107 is the the standard deviation of the density contrast filtered on mass scale @xmath25 ( e.g. mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "for a cylinder of comoving radius @xmath108 , and length @xmath109 , we have : @xmath110}{x^2(1-x^2 ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hskip100pt\\times(1+fx^2)^2\\frac{p(k)}{k^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite ( with several typos in the corresponding expression in that paper corrected here ) , where @xmath111 is the linear growth factor , @xmath112 is the linear power spectrum at @xmath34 , and the factor @xmath113 , with @xmath114^{0.6}$ ] , is the correction to the cylinder length for the departure from hubble expansion due to peculiar velocities @xcite .",
    "illustrative results are plotted for 3-@xmath99 fluctuations as a function of @xmath81 , for @xmath115 and 8.5 , in figure  [ rms_z8.5 ] , along with the expected sensitivity limits for the planned lofar ( 300 m filled aperture ) and ska ( 1 km filled aperture ) arrays .",
    "we plot in figure  [ rms_theta25 ] the predicted spectral variation of these fluctuations vs. redshift @xmath36 for illustrative beam sizes of @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "these 3-@xmath99 fluctuations should be observable with both lofar and ska with integration times of between 100 and 1000 hours . for a @xmath117 beam , for example",
    ", 3-@xmath99 fluctuations can be detected for untilted @xmath2cdm by both with a 100  h integration for @xmath118 and a 1000  h integration for @xmath119 , while for a @xmath120 beam , ska can detect them after 100  h for @xmath121 and after 1000  h for @xmath122 .",
